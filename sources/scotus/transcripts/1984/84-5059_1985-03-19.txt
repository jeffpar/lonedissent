ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Mr. Ripple, I think you

““

This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
court of appeals of the State_of Indiana.

It presents a

10

single question with respect to the interpretation of

11

the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.

12

decide whether Indiana could try the petitioner on a

13

charge which was not mentioned in the detainer used to

14

obtain his temporary and limited custody from the penal

15

authorities of the State of Michigan.

The Court must

16

The facts of this case are complicated, and I

17

would like to state very succinctly the essence of our

18

position on that question before I spend a good deal of

19

time on the facts, which I think are difficult to grasp.

20

In essence, our submission is that this

21

question can be answered by a straightforward of the

22

IAD.

case Indiana — only has authority to try a prisoner on

24

those charges mentioned in the detainer or on those

charges which arise out of the same transaction as those

MR. RIPPLE*

14

They should complain because the

MR. RIPPLE*

That's correct.
They got rid of him.
But Michigan and the other states

20

of the Union must in fact live with the uncertainty of

21

knowing that Indiana will not abide by this agreement as

22

it was set up.

you at this time, because I think they are not of

You think

QUESTION:

You say they are fasts not of

record?

6

MR. RIPPLE:

They are subsequent to trial, but

7

I think pertinent to the disposition of the case, and I

8

think, therefore, I have an obligation to inform the

9

Court of them.

10

After trial on June 6, 1930 — 1982, the

11

petitioner was in fact paroled into the custody of the

12

State of Indiana and was incarcerated by the State of

13

Indiana.

14

19th, 1984, Michigan in fact discharged the petitioner

15

from his sentence to- incarceration in the State of

16

Michigan.

17

the State of Indiana.

18

24th of the current year, but will be subject to

19

probation for one additional year.

On the second — I’m sorry — on February

He therefore continued his incarceration in
He is due for release on April

20

I am indebted to my colleagues from the state

21

for helping me obtain that information, and I thought I

22

had a duty to the Court to mention that to you.

23

Again, our basic position is that for all

24

purposes other than the charges mentioned in the

25

detainer, the prisoner remains subject to the
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

jurisdiction of the sending state; that therefore, in

2

this case the trial court in Indiana was without

3

authority to try the petitioner on the Diazepam charges

4

and, as a result, its judgment of conviction is void.

5

Now, the facts of the case are difficult to

6

get a grasp on because they cover a long period of

7

time.

8

the following factors were kept in mind as I go through

9

them.

And I suggest to the Court it would be helpful if

10

First of all, Indiana has incrementally

11

recognized the correctness of the straightforward

12

approach I have just suggested.

13

in this proceeding, now admitted by Indiana, could have

14

very easily been corrected at an earlier stage in these

15

proceedings.

Indeed, the basic error

16

We are only here today because despite its

17

confession of error, the State of Indiana refuses to

18

give up the product of its earlier overreaction;

19

void conviction of the petitioner.

20

reluctance of the State of Indiana is indeed contrary to

21

their own best interests as signatories to the

22

Interstate Agreement on Detainers.

23

the

We submit that this

Now, we have set forth the operative facts in

24

summary fashion on pages 2 and 3 of our brief and in

25

more plenary fashion at pages 3 through 8.

involve what we in Indiana call two criminal causes.

2

The first cause, Section 424, involves three charges of

3

dealing with a controlled substance called Diazepam.

4

The second cause. Cause 470, deals with delivery of

5

marijuana.

6

How, the underlying events with respect to the

7

first of those causes,

8

cause we contend he should not have been tried upon —

took place over a three-month period in early 1979.

the Diazepam cause — that's the

And

10

the petitioner was arraigned on those charges in April

11

of 1979.

12

Now, as we've noted in some detail in our

13

brief at page 4, he initially pleaded guilty — not

14

guilty to those charges, and then later attempted to

15

plead guilty pursuant to a plea agreement.

16

trial judge refused to accept the plea agreement,

17

because he considered the plea to be improvident.

18

trial was set eventually for March 1980 but later

19

continued.

20

But the

The

Before trial was had on that first Diazepam

21

cause, the one which is in question here, the petitioner

22

was arraigned in May of 1980 on the second cause, the

23

marijuana cause.

24

that cause took place in December 1979, almost 12 months

25

after the underlying events for the first cause, and

The underlying events with respect to

1

therefore, there is no question that they were not in

2

any way related crimes, and no one has contended that.

3
4

In November 1980, after he had been arraigned
on both causes but not tried on either, the petitioner

5

was incarcerated by the State of Michigan pursuant to an

6

unrelated felony charge.

7

been in Michigan incarceration for several months, the

8

prosecutor from Howard County, Indiana mailed to the

9

warden of the prison in Jackson, Michigan a detainer

In March 1981, after he had

10

which indicated that he wished to bring the petitioner

11

to trial on two counts of dealing in marijuana.

12

Now, if I may anticipate a question at this

13

point, it ought to be noted that one of the followup

14

documents which was sent to Michigan to obtain temporary

15

custody of the petitioner several months after the

16

actual detainer was filed erroneously listed the cause

17

number for the Diazepam counts, and said the petitioner

18

was wanted on three counts of dealing in marijuana.

19

Now, at trial the State of Indiana contended

20

that this in fact was an independent detainer with

21

respect to the Diazepam counts.

22

Indiana in its-opinion — and you'll note this at the

23

Joint Appendix page 168 — said that no reasonable

24

factfinder could reach that conclusion.

25

the State of Indiana has in fact dropped that contention

The court of appeals of

2

at this point
So in short, having been told that he was

3

going to return to Indiana to stand trial on two counts

4

of delivery of marijuana, the petitioner waived his

5

rights under Article 4 of the IAD, came across the

6

border and — in the custody of Indiana authorities.

7

He came across on July 21st,

1981 from Jackson

8

prison in Indiana over to Howard County, city of Kokomo

9

in Indiana.

That’s northcentral Indiana.

On July 23rd

10

he did file with the court a suggested plea bargain with

11

respect to the Diazepam cause on the ground, but later

12

withdrew it, and he filed a motion to dismiss on the

13

ground that ha had been brought across the border

14

unwittingly with respect to the Diazepam charges.

15

QUESTION^

Mr. Ripple, what if he hadn’t

16

agreed voluntarily to leave Michigan?

17

could have been brought against his will over.

18

MR. RIPPLEs

I suppose he

Under Article 4 of the Interstate

19

Agreement, Mr. Justice White, he had the right to

20

request a hearing under the Uniform Extradition Act, and

21

he also had a right to request that the Governor.of

22

Michigan not honor the extradition reguest, which —

23
24

Well, nevertheless, he could have

been — if these procedures — if they’d gone through

2

MR. RIPPLE:

correct procedures.

QUESTION:

If they had gone through the

All right.

Suppose that had

5

happened, and then the same thing happened at trial.

6

you think the Governor could have treated

MR. RIPPLE:

Co

that later

On the Diazepam charges?

So,

Your Honor, I do not believe so because, as the court of

10

appeals of Indiana stated,

11

the prisoner or the Governor on notice that in fact he

12

was wanted on those charges.

13

may invite your attention to Defense Exhibits 4 and 5 in

14

the record, Michigan later by letter verified that their

15

understanding was — the Michigan authorities were under

16

the understanding that only the delivery of marijuana

17

charges were at issue, that they did not know anything

18

about these Diazepam causes.

19

I believe —

11

exactly what the remedy ought to be, and that is, the

judgment is void and therefore cannot stand.

13

In its brief in the court of appeals of

14

Indiana, although not in this Court, the State of

15

Indiana did note the lack of remedial language in

16

Section 5(g).

17

expect that there would be remedial in 5(g).

Or you might say they did their

work against the Ker and Frisbie cases in that case.
MR. RIPPLE4

I think, Hr. Justice Rehnguist,
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that an entire reading of the Interstate Agreement on

2

Detainers, especially Article I, indicates that they

3

were aware of Ker and Frisbie and in fact were trying to

4

establish a system substantially different from Ker and

5

Frisbie that would bring a certain amount of certainty

6

and comity to an area which otherwise would not be

7

governed by Ker and Frisbie.

8

QUESTION

Well, but there is a certain amount

9

of waste motion involved here if we sustain your claim.

10

There’s no charge that the trial was in any way unfair.

11

If we sustain your claim and say that — your client’s

12

15

he’ll be extradited and tried again when there’s no

16

complaint that his first trial was unfair.

The charges in Indiana are

2

It's wasted judicial energy, but it’s wasted

3

judicial energy because of the error of the state.

4

Indeed, in this case, as I indicated earlier, the state

5

— we were in a position at trial to remedy this in a

6

very easy sort of way, and indeed, if our position here

7

is upheld, this will be remedied very easily in the

8

future.

9

In reading through the entire motion to

10

dismiss you will notice that both counsel for the

11

accused at trial and counsel for the state at trial both

12

suggested an alternate remedy to the trial judge at

13

trial; that in fact he could have severed the two causes

14

at trial, proceeded with the marijuana cause, and

15

permitted both the petitioner and the State of Michigan

16

to exercise their rights under the IAD.

17

amounted to at most a 31-day lapse of time, and they

18

could have tried the man cn this second charge again.

It would have

Now, if I may return just for a moment —

20

QUESTION!

May I interrupt before you do?

In

21

one of Justice O'Connor's questions she raised the

22

question whether the judgment was with prejudice or not;

23

and I had not understood that the judgment was void,

24

that you were taking the position that it would bar

25

further prosecution.

1

HR. RIPPLE:

We have. Hr. Justice, in this

2

case because it has gone on for so long and because the

3

facts of the situation have changed, we have a rather

4

unusual circumstance.

5

Our position is,

number one, that the judgment

6

of conviction is void because it was entered by a court

7

which had no authority to act with respect to that

8
9

• cause.

If this had happened, for instance, at the court

of appeals of Indiana level, it may well have been

10

proper to reverse the conviction, require that Indiana

11

send the man back to Michigan, and that the Interstate

12

Agreement on Detainers in fact be followed.

13

Here we don't have that option, because he's

14

been discharged in Michigan.

15

circumstances, at the very least Michigan needs to -- cr

16

rather Indiana needs to retry the petitioner.

17

conviction cannot stand.

18

is in fact a — the situation has changed not at our

19

hands — we timely raised this at trial — but at the

20

hands of the state which overreacted at trial, that

21

indeed this ought to be dismissed with prejudice at this

22

point.

These are very serious charges, and

14

ME. RIPPLEs

Well, it may very well be

15

impossible for the man to get a fair trial at this

16

point, to defend himself at this point, among other

17

points. Justice O’Connor.

18

If I may return to your question for just a

19

moment, because I don’t think I completely answered it,

20

with respect to why there’s no remedial actual remedy

21

spelled out here, but there is for the other — in other

22

areas of the IAD, my submission is we would not expect

23

it here, because the general jurisprudence indicates

24

that a court without authority has a void judgment.

25

That’s not true in the other areas where a
16

remedy is actually spelled out.

what they did mean.

In those areas we're

me wherein your client has suffered prejudice other than

not having a formalistic procedure to follow?

of .the pending charge in Indiana, the more serious one.

He had pleaded not guilty to it.

11

your alternative suggestion, he could go back to

12

Hichigan and redo it all over again.

13

And presumably even cn

I suppose what you're saying is is he was

14

prejudiced because the State of Michigan and its

15

Governor didn't have the opportunity listen to him and

16

reach a contrary conclusion; and that's a pretty weak

17

reed on which to lean, isn't it?

18

MR. RIPPLE:

He was also prejudiced by being

19

charged — by being tried by a court which did not have

20

aut-hority to enter a judgment of conviction against him

21

and give him a consecutive sentence with respect to the

22

charge.

23

in other areas of the law we acknowledge the fact that a

24

party can be prejudiced that way.

custody, used the word "marijuana" rather than "Schedule

One of the benefits that

under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers is that they
can, unless the court indicates otherwise, serve these
sentences concurrently.

So that in this case the

petitioner, rather than having to delay his sentence on

MR. DAILY;

It clears the books, but —

That's certainly one of the

reasons for the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, so
that prisoners can get rid of pending charges, and

unless they are sentenced tc consecutive sentences, they

can serve them, out concurrently rather than

that provision, assuming there's not a consecutive

Bell, was the sentence imposed by

No, it was not.

sentence for the marijuana charge and a five-year

in the receiving state, if we do anything with the

him off in response to the detainer?

MR. DAILY:

No, because the petitioner in this

11

case is asserting a different-violation of the

12

Interstate Agreement on Detainers.

That argument has

13

not been raised by the petitioner.

That argument could

14

be raised had he adopted that approach, I think.

15

this case the argument is based on total lack of

16

jurisdiction in the Indiana court.

17

QUESTION:

But in

Well, it seems to me it's related

18

that there is no jurisdiction until there's a proper

at least that's how I understand the article.

MR. DAILY:

right to bring prisoners into a state illegally.

Of

8

course, the state doesn’t have a right to bring

9

prisoners into a state illegally, but under the

10

Ker-Frisbie cases, even though the state violates a

11

federal law, the state can try that defendant, and the

12

conviction should be affirmed.

13

The Frisbie v. Collins case is extremely

I think had that test been applied in Cuyler

The Cuyler Court, quoting from a law review

that the traditional role of the Compact Clause was to

give Congress supervisory power over cooperative state

4

I think, if you had applied that test to

5

determine whether the Interstate Agreement on Detainers

6

interfered with the full and free exercise of federal

7

authority, you would have come to a different result.

The test actually adopted by this Court in
Cuyler used the language "appropriate for federal

11

and the 14th Amendment and certain other provisions of

12

And uncertainty for every other state in the union and

the federal government, because they no longer will know

whether or not the states will abide by the agreement
