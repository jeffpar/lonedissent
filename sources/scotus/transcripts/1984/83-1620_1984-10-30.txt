2

Well there, Mr. Zink, there was an

situation against the federal obligations?
ME. ZINK;

I do net believe

6

so.

It was a peculiar -- they included -- they defined

7

gross income to include what is normally exempt income.

8

They expressly included federal obligations, income from

federal obligations in gross income.
Then there was another statute,

10

or section in

12

we can’t include exempt income in your income, then you

will lose a proportional part of your deductions against
