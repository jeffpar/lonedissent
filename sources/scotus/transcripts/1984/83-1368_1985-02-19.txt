ORAL ARGUMENT CF CATHERINE G. O’SULLIVAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. O’SULLIVAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

17

it please the Court, the fundamental reason for concern

18

in this case from the government’s perspective is that

19

an overly literal application of the per se group

20

boycott label to conduct of joint ventures threatens to

21

substantially undercut their procompetitive potential.

22

This Court has often observed that group

23

boycotts are per se illegal, but it has only

24

characterized conduct as a group boycott in cases

25

involving an attempt to eliminate rivalry in the sense

In fact,
