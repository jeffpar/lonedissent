CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

this afternoon in Liparota against the United States.

Mr. Kuyck, you may proceed whenever you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM THOMAS HUYCK, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We’ll hear arguments

MR. HUYCK;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

10

This case presents the Court with a question

11

of interpretation of the language of a federal criminal

12

statute.

13

VII is one of a common type of criminal statute appended

14

to a statute of Congress establishing a program — in

15

this case the food stamp program — and providing for

16

criminal prosecution for fraud, and stating in relevant

17

part that whoever knowingly acquires food stamps in any

18

manner not authorized by this chapter is guilty of an

19

offense.

20

The statute at issue, Section 2024(b) of Title

And the issue that’s presented as to the

21

wording of this statute is, taking the phrase, again in

22

relevant part, acquires coupons in any manner not

23

authorized by the chapter, since Congress has chosen to

24

use the word "knowingly," does the word "knowingly"

25

apply to that entire phrase; or, as argued By the
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Government, does it apply to only a portion of the

2

phrase, namely "acquires coupons"; that in other words,

3

the offender knew he was acquiring coupons, but that he

4

need not know it was in any manner in violation of the

5

statute.

6

The facts of this case can be stated very

7

briefly.

8

sandwich shop in a poor neighborhood in Chicago which

9

was net a member of the food stamp program.

The petitioner and his brother ran a small

There was

10

quite a bit of evidence in the record about the

11

enforcement of the food stamp regulations against food

12

stores and other participants in the food stamp program

13

which in essence establishes a tremendous amount of

14

notice and warning prior to undercover criminal

15

investigation.

16

shop that petitioner and his brother ran.

17

None of this applied to the sandwich

An undercover agent with a secret tape

18

recorder came into their sandwich shop, having gone to a

19

food store that she was investigating, the food store

20

having told them that they would not buy food stamps

21

from her, and then’she went to — but told her try the

22

sandwich shop down the street, whereupon she sent into

23

the sandwich shop, offered to sell food stamps at a

24

discount to petitioner and his brother, and did so on

25

three occasions, whereupon they were prosecuted.

(202) 628-9300

1

The issue that is before this Court was raised

2

in the jury instruction contents.

3

myself, offered a specific intent jury instruction, the

4

standard specific intent jury instruction, that he had

5

to be purposefully intending to violate the law.

6

The trial counsel,

The Government objected, and the judge agreed,

7

that this was a strict liability offense as to the

8

element of knowledge of violating the law, and

9

thereupon, the judge's instruction to the jury told the

10

jury in essence there were three elements of the

11

offense, and he divided the action element from the

12

knowledge element.

13

that the defendant acquired and possessed food stamp

14

coupons for cash in a manner not authorized by federal

15

statute, the act; and then he said second, they have to

16

find the defendant knowingly and willfully acquired the

17

food stamps, but not that it was in a manner in

18

violation of the regulations.

19

QUESTION*

He said that they had to find first

In your view did that mean the jury

20

need only find that the defendant knew that the food

21

stamps were food stamps and not postcards, so to speak?

22

HR. HUYCKi

Yes, exactly.

And that — there

23

was a colloquy with the court, and in fact the colloquy

24

went so far as my asking the court can I argue to the

25

jury — my client had testified in this case that he was
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

not familiar with the food stamp regulations, and that

2

he did not know that it violated any regulations for him

3

to be buying these food stamps from this undercover

4

agent.

5

had other than entrapment, which was also a defense.

6

this took me by surprise that this was going to be

7

interpreted not as a specific intent crime, and so there

8

was a colloguy, and I asked the judge can I argue that

9

to the jury, and the judge said no, you cannot argue

10

So

ignorance of the law in this case to the jury.

11
12

And this was virtually the only defense that he

QUESTIONi

Do you think Congress was concerned

about acts or attitudes?
HE. HUYCKs

13

I think that Congress in drafting

14

the statute used the word "knowingly" for some purpose,

15

and I think that they — this is a statute where the

16

element of it being in violation of the statute is

17

written right into the words of the statute.

18

think that by using the phrase "knowingly acquires food

19

stamps in any manner net permitted by this chapter, that

20

that is the plain meaning of Congress.

21

1

QUESTIONS

And sc I

You don't think it means that

22

Congress was concerned about whether he knew what he was

23

doing?

24
25

MR. HUYCKi

No.

That's precisely my point.

They did not use the word "knowingly" —

(202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION;

And don't you think this

2

instruction that was given submitted that issue to the

3

jury fairly?

4

MR. HUYCKi

It submitted the issue as far as

5

"knowingly" goes.

6

the issue whether defendant knowingly and willfully

7

acquired the food stamps, period.

8

colloquy that we had, he was clearly intending to leave

9

out that he knew it was in a manner violated by the

10
11

He carefully did this.

He submitted

And in view of the

statute.
Eut I want to emphasize that this is not a

12

case where I am arguing for any kind of an ignorance of

13

the law defense to a crime of this kind, and I'm not

14

even arguing for the specific intent instruction that I

15

offered at trial.

16

hastily at the end of the trial, and I think that fairly

17

-- it fairly raised the issue.

18

arguing here is exactly the one that was pointed out, if

19

I can quote some language from Justice Brennan's opinion

20

in United States v. Freed, a concurring opinion, "The

21

definition of the crime as written by Congress requires

22

proof of circumstances that involve the legal element."

23

That was done — this issue came up

But the issue that I'm

In other words, this is not a general

24

ignorance of the law defense.

25

there's a legal element that is an attendant

This is a statute where

circumstance, as you will,

2

of this offense has an element of an act, acquiring food

3

stamps, and an element of an attendant circumstance,

4

namely that that acquisition is not in any manner

5

authorized by the statute.

6

of the crime.

The definition

And you have, I think, in the Model Penal Code

7

a much more reasonable basis for interpreting criminal

8

statutes of this kind than to quibble about the way that

9

modifying language can be phrased in the English

10

language.

11

brief, the results should not just turn on the

12

fortuitous way that a phrase is turned.

13

And as I tried to make an example in my reply

Judge Kagruder in the St. Johnsbury Trucking

14

case that I cited used the example of adulterated milk.

15

If you have a statute that says whoever knowingly sells

16

adulterated milk, people would assume that that means

17

that you have to know it was adulterated as well as

18

knowing that it was milk.

19

way, "milk which had been adulterated," using a phrase

20

instead of an adverb, an adjective, you should have the

21

same result.

But if you phrased it this

22

But the Government could make the same

23

analysis of that language that it’s making here.

24

could say that you have "knowingly" modifying the verb

25

"sell", and then "milk" is the object of "sell”, and the
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

It

1

phrase "which has been adulterated" is a separate phrase

2

modifying the verb "sell" and that —

3

QUESTION;

Of course, there's some bit of

4

difference, it seams to me, because if you're talking

5

about a prohibition against the sale of milk, milk is

6

ordinarily an article of commerce, and you simply

7

wouldn't expect its ordinary milk sale to be

8

prohibited.

But food stamps are not really an article

9

of commerce.

It seems to me that perhaps a potential

10

defendant may be on some notice when someone comes to

11

him with food stamps whether or not they can be

12

acquired.

13

someone comes into your store and offers to sell.

14

This is not an ordinary commodity that

HR. HUYCKi

Well, that's correct, Your Honor,

15

and I certainly am not offering up milk. ' I’m offering

16

this an example of phraseology in the English language,

17

and the bottom line being I think you ought to use, for

18

instance, the Model Penal Code rule of construction that

19

if a word such as "knowingly" appears in front of a

20

statute, that you assume that it applies to every

21

element of the offense stated in the statute, unless the

22

contrary point intent plainly appears.

23
24
25

QUESTION;

But other —

Is there any way of purchasing food

stamps?
MR. HUYCK:

Is there any — no, there is no
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

legal way of purchasing food stamps, that's correct.
QUESTIONS

So he starts off — he knew he was

doing something wrong when he purchased.
MR. HUYCKs
QUESTION;
MR. HUYCKs

Ke told the jury that he didn't.
Hmm?
But I admit he had a tough case.

But he told the jury that he didn't.

And,

of course,

we're talking about a statute here that applies to the
entire chapter and all of the regulations issued there
under.

We're not just talking about trafficking

violations.
But I certainly agree with you. Your Honor,
that this was a tough case for the defendant, because,
purchasing food stamps, there is no legal way of doing
it, that's correct.
QUESTION;

And —
Like purchasing drugs, like

purchasing opium, isn't it?
MR. HUYCK:

Well, no, I don't think that it

necessarily is the same as that.
QUESTION;
MR. HUYCKi

I think that —

You mean it isn't as clearly.
I think that when you're trying to

draw a line as to which limited -- and in the U.S.
Gypsum case the Court said there are very limited
circumstances where in the absence of a term defining
the mental state, you will imply that Congress meant

1

strict liability as to that element, very limited

2

circumstances.

3

dangerous instrumentality cases -- firearms, drugs and

4

so or — where the Court’s analysis has been that

5

Congress probably intended strict liability as that

6

element because of the very nature of the items.

7

do net think that food stamps are such an item.

8

And one of them is this line of

QUESTION*

And I

Under your analysis, the Government

9

would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only

10

that the defendant knowingly acquired food stamps, but

11

that he knew that his acquisition was not authorized by

12

law, is that correct?

13

ME. HUYCK:

14

QUESTION*

15

That’s correct.
How would the Government prove that

second element?

16

ME. HUYCK*

Well, it was argued to the jury

17

very effectively by the prosecutor in this case

18

incidentally, enough the judge told her that she didn't

19

have to, they said -- she said these transactions took

place in the back room.

My contention here is that the proof of the

so-called criminal intent of the defendant in this case

3

is nc more difficult for the Government than in any

other criminal case.

the jury that the circumstances of the offense show a

consciousness on the part of the defendant that he knew

he was doing wrong.

You're always making arguments to

And —

QUESTIONS

Well, do you think it's a fair

10

argument to say that in most of the cases, the vast

11

majority of the cases like this, the defendant would

12

know, he'd actually know that he was doing something

13

wrong ?

14
15

KR. HUYCKs

I think so.

I think so.

As long

as --

16

QUESTION;

And the Government says well, sc

17

why should we put the prosecutor up to have him prove it

18

in every single case.

19

concede that if it were clear that Congress intended

20

this to be a nonspecific intent case that you wouldn’t

21

have any leg to stand on.

22

HR. HUYCK;

And so you're saying you would

Oh, certainly in interpreting a

23

federal criminal statute if the meaning is plain, that

24

ends it.

25

meaning is plain, and I think that it's an ambiguous —

I don't think that this is a case where the

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

at the very least it’s an ambiguous statute to which ycu

2

should apply the rule of leniety.

3

But I — but think of all the -- I put one

4

example in my brief.

5

to prosecute trafficking.

6

prosecution is no difficulty for the Government.

7

Government doesn’t need strict liability because

Congress intended that they use these undercover agents

to go to grocery stores, and that's what they do for the

This statute can be used not only

QUESTION:

2

MB. HUYCK:

I agree with you.
— to talk about that we’re

3

recognizing that there are different elements in an

4

offense, and we’re talking about this particular element.

5

But to go back to an earlier question, why --

6

it seems to me clear that Congress did not use the word

7

"knowingly” here just to say that you couldn’t prosecute

8

someone who did not actually know that what they had was

9

a food stamp.

And that is not, I submit, a very common

10

use cf the word "knowingly" or "willfully" in criminal

11

statutes.

12

was the reason Congress put the word "knowingly" in here.

13

And there's no reason to believe that that

Now, the Government points to the following

14

section, subsection (c), and also that this was almost

15

the sole reliance of the Seventh Circuit in holding that

16

they could divine Congress’ intent, because subsection

17

(c)

18

was worded in a different way.
Subsection (c) is a two-actor offense.

The

19

offense — the statute is directed against whoever

20

presents coupons for redemption, namely a grocery stores

21

who’s redeeming coupons; and that that person who’s

22

knowing that he’s presented coupons for redemption,

23

knows that those coupons were received, transferred or

24

used in a manner in violation of the chapter, which

25

could be a different person.
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

So in other words, you're saying the person

2

presenting the coupons knew that, if it was another

3

person, that other person got the food stamps in an

4

illegal manner.

5

the word "knowingly" appears in a different place in

6

that section than in subsection (b).

7

8

That is, to me, the pure answer of why

QUESTION*

It’s a —

Is it agreed that (c) does require

proof of specific intent?

9

MR. HUYCK*

It requires the -- yes.

It

10

requires the knowledge that's specifically stated there;

11

in other words, knowledge that these stamps were

12

received in —

13
14

QUESTION*

Well, you read that as meaning

specific intent.

15

MR. HUYCK*

As to that only — no, no, nc,

16

no.

17

that element has to be proved, namely that the person

18

presenting the stamps for redemption has to know that

19

those stamps were received by somebody in violation of

20

the statute.

21

That -- well, yes, right; that specific intent,

But in subsection (c) they don’t say whoever

22

knowingly presents food stamps for redemption.

23

in that section did not feel that they had to use the

24

word "knowingly" to prevent the prosecution of a grocer

25

who's handing in something that he doesn't know are food

QUESTIONS

Hell, is it entirely accurate to

3

equate the term "knowingly" and speak of that as a

4

specific intent?

5

the intent with which you do an act, and knowingly has

6

always struck me as something a little bit different, or

7

either less or more inclusive than the intention.

8
9

I mean an intent is something — is

MR. HUYCXs

Well, here again, I think that the

Model Penal Code offers guidance, because the definition

10

of "knowingly" there as to an act is different than

11

"knowingly" as to a circumstance.

12

circumstance here, and I think the definition is very

13

straightforward, that he knows that such facts exist.

14

And here the circumstance is that they were acquired in

15

a manner in violation of the statute.

16

that fact exists, that that was the manner in which they

17

were acquired.

18

accurate term.

19

So I think

We’re talking about a

that "knowingly" is a very

I think that this Court’s Bailey decision,

20

United States v. Bailey, I think has been — had a very

21

salutcry effect in eliminating in many criminal trials

22

this same specific intent instruction that I submitted

23

in this case.

24

25

specific element in the offense.

2

at a disadvantage over a state judge, and I have cited

3

an Illinois case, the Valley Steel case, as an

4

illustration of how much easier this job is for a judge

5

in a state that’s adopted the Model Penal fcode where you

6

can look at the rules of construction and find, if it's

7

not expressly put in there by the legislature, find what

8

the mental element is as to each element of the offense.

QUESTIONS

And a federal judge is

Assume the law was as you suggest,

10

that the Government must establish that proof.

11

the whole record it is perfectly clear that that

knowledge was possessed by the defendant, then would not

13

the absence of the instruction you request be a harmless

14

error?

15

MR. HUYCK:

If on

Well, I think that question is

16

particularly raised in this case because of what I

17

pointed out in my reply brief, that in fact, his

18

knowledge was argued tc the jury, even though the judge

19

said that I couldn’t argue it, the prosecutor argued it

20

even though she didn’t have to, and then I argued it

21

responding to the prosecutor.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. HUYCK:

And so I think that --

Then the jury -— on that point, it clearly

presents this questions

that the jury listens

And I think that sometimes it seems that it's

8

harsh to reverse a criminal conviction and have a new

9

trial because of instructions, but I think that here you

10

certainly don't have a harmless misinstruction, if it is

11

a misinstruction.

12

It's very crucial.

QUESTIONs

Hell, if on the whole record it’s

13

perfectly clear that he did have the knowledge that you

14

say should be shown, isn't that enough?

15

MR. HUYCKj

No, because the jury when they get

16

back to deliberate, they were looking at this

17

instruction, they found that they did not have to find

18

that he knew that it was in a manner in violation cf the

19

statute.

20

was clearly trying to make that distinction in these

21

instructions.

22

And the colloquy makes clear that the judge

I want to say something about the Yermian

23

case.

24

closely to this Court's decision last term in Yermian,

25

trying to say that this statute is similar to Yermian,

The Government has pinned its argument very

18

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

and the case should be decided in the same manner.

2

The text is different from the text, and the

3

circumstances are different, and the case is not

4

governed by the Yermian decision.

'5

Section 1001, and you had the making of a false

6

statement, and then the phrase "in any matter in a

7

jurisdiction of a federal agency."

8

9
10

Yermian involved

In that statute the phrase "in any matter"
came at the beginning of the sentence before the word
"knowingly."

11

That's a difference.

The previous statute, which the Court also

12

said in a footnote also has a clear meaning that it

13

doesn't apply to that phrase, the phrase did follow the

14

word "knowingly," but they were separated by a comma.

15

I think that — and even the statute where it

16

came at the beginning, four members of this Court felt

17

that it wasn't clear it was Congress' meaning that the

18

word "knowingly" did not apply to that phrase "in any

19

matter."

20

But I think more importantly, the background

21

of this case makes it crucially different.

22

steps involved here to the Government's argument, and

23

they don't really follow through on the second step.

24

It's cne thing to say did Congress mean the word

25

"knowingly" to apply to this phrase "in any manner," but

There's twc

(202) 628-9300

if you agree with them that it doesn't, then you have
the next questioni

what mental state should be applied

to that element of this offense?
And this Court has clearly stated on several
occasions — in the Bailey case, in the United States
Gypsum case, and in the Morissette case -- that the mere
omission of a word defining the mental intent does not
mean that it’s strict liability.

It dees not answer the

question just to say there isn't any word there defining
the mental element.

And I think that it's —

Well, so the Yermian court then went on and
relied on a couple of elements that are not present in
this case, the first being that it was a jurisdictional
element.

And the Court clearly stated that

jurisdictional language need not contain the same
culpability requirement as other elements of the
offense, quoting this Court's opinion in Feola.

And the

fact that that was a jurisdictional element in Yermian
clearly was a point of distinction for this Court in
trying to discern the meaning of Congress in the statute.
Secondly, Yermian had a particular — the
statute had a particular legislative history which was
debated at length in both the majority and dissenting
opinions, which we do not have here — a dissenting
opinion where the statute originally made it clear that
20

it was only a defendant that knew he was defrauding the

2

United States could be convicted, and then during —

3

because of the vicissitudes of that statute, that

4

language had been taken out, the issue being how much cf

5

the language had been taken out.

6

So that the analysis — in other words, my

7

central point is the analysis doesn't stop once you say

8

that Congress didn't mean "knowingly" to apply to this

9

phrase "in any manner."

The analysis does not stop

there.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22
23

MR. ROTH? ELD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
As one of Justice White’s questions suggested,

24

the dispute1in this case is not about whether Section

25

2024(b) contains a scienter element of some sort.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Neither of the proposed readings of.the statute would

2

impose strict or absolute liability.

3

reading the prosecution will have to prove that the

4

defendant knew that he was handling food stamps and was

5

aware of the nature of his activities.

6

of the statute would permit a defendant to be convicted

7

for accidental or inadvertent conduct.

8

significant limitation on the reach of Section 2024(b),

9

because it means that only defendants who were aware

And this is a

10

that they were engaging in certain types of foodstamp

11

transactions, which is the type of activity that almost

12

everyone realizes is subject to some sort of federal

13

regulation, ohly a defendant of that sort would be

14

subject to conviction.

15

So the dispute here is a narrower ones

16

whether in addition to these other limitations in the

17

statute, Congress wanted to take the further very

18

unusual step of excusing a defendant whenever the

19

Government is unable to establish its familiarity with

the law.

Any more awareness required?
Simply that he was conscious of

conduct would not fall within the scope of the statute.

But basically I think what you've described is correct.

16

MR. ROTHFELD:

within the group of words in the statute.

6

— really no authorized manner in the statute defining

7

how to possess a food stamp.

how to apply for food stamps, how to use food stamps.

But it*s difficult to say that someone, once having

the problem is why your grocer hypothetical presents a

I think that your suggestion that someone

should not go to jail foe something that they had no

whatever manner, say to use the facts of this case as an

illustration, someone offers to sell a food stamp to a

20

nonparticipant in the food stamp program or to a

21

participant in the food stamp program.

22

even if the nonparticipant has no detailed awareness of

the requirements of the Food Stamp Act, nevertheless, I

seems a reasonable view, that person would have some

Certainly any reasonable person would realize

that there is some doubt about the propriety of

acquisition of a food stamp in that manner, which is not

true of the grocer you hypothesized, because he has

has accepted it from his employee.

I keep returning to that —

So all you're proving, all you're

why Congress would probably impose an intent requirement.

I've taken too much of your time.

questions lead to an important point, which is the

doing is wrong, what they're doing is potentially

21

punishable or subject to federal regulation.

22

think that the vast majority of cases in which our

23

interpretation of the statute will apply, I think in

probably all cases that will be true, certainly for a

extremely surprising to find that anyone has any doubts,

anyone walking along the street who's offered food

There's no doubt that Congress

and I think Congress did that, for example, in 2024(c)

21

intention explicitly.

or, as in 2024(c), by making explicit the requirement

6

that the prosecution prove the defendant's knowledge of

7

the type of property he was dealing with.

8
9

It has generally done so by using —

But section 2024(b) does none of those

met its burden of proving that the defendant knew that

The Government would still be

activities.
That is a very peculiar burden to place on the

12

Government, and the court of appeals decision by

13

declining to read such a requirement into the statute

14

essentially has simply made it impossible for

15

individuals who engage in these questionable food stamp

16

transactions to be able to immunize themselves from

17

liability by remaining ignorant of the nature of the

18

food stamp law in the implementing regulations.

19

And I should add one very brief point which I

20

think strongly supports the court of appeals decision,

21

and that is the nature of the Food Stamp Act as a whole,

22

and the other provisions of the Food Stamp Act which

23

impose an enormously strict series of requirements and

24

potential penalties on everyone who can be expected to

25

come in contact with stamps to prevent every conceivable

2

misuse of food stamps.
We set out in our brief this very

3

fantastically complex and burdensome series of

4

requirements, and it's very difficult to believe that

5

Congress would have imposed these burdens on everyone

6

who might possibly have any legitimate reason to come

7

into contact with a stamp, and then allowed someone to

8

engage in what everyone would realize to be a doubtful

9

transaction and be able to avoid liability because he

10

never bothered to learn the elements of the food stamp

11

laws or its implementing regulations.

12

The nature of the Food Stamp Act I think also

13

gives 2024(b) the characteristics that the Court has

14

said repeatedly are typical of statutes in which

15

Congress has not included a knowing illegality element.

16

And I think this responds to your basic point, Justice

17

Stevens, about the danger of putting someone in prison

18

who doesn't know what he was doing was wrong.

19

I think the presumption the Court has applied

20

in cases like Gypsum and florissette, when Congress has

21

legislated against the background of.common law offense,

22

it is understood, unless it signals its intentions to

23

the contrary, that it did not mean to direct the statute

24

at anyone other than blameworthy defendants.

25

is not necessarily the presumption of statutes that have

But that

2

the court of appeals termed are statutes of prohibition

3

rather than statutes of punishment that are designed to

4

prevent some significant regulatory injury, and of

5

particular importance, that operate in an area such as

6

the food stamp area where certainly anyone who comes

7

into contact with a stamp has a good idea that there is

regulation.

suggested,

These are not, as Justice Rehnquist
these are not normal articles of commerce

10

that everyone comes across every day, and they should be

11

on their guard.

12

Now, given the nature of the Food Stamp Act,

13

which allocates with as much precision as possible the

14

necessary number of coupons to individuals in need, any

15

violation of the Act’s requirements, whether intentional

16

or whether or not the person knew he was violating the

majority of imaginable cases that someone who is

14

enormous complexity of the Food Stamp Act and the

congressional purposes, on the crucial question of the

case, which is congressional intent, there is no reason

to think that Congress would have wanted someone who

should have suspected to be of questionable validity tc

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM THOMAS HUYUCK, ESQ.,

2

OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEE — REBUTTAL

3

MR. HUYCKs

4

I do not agree, of course, with

Thank you, Your Honor.
the Government

5

that Congress has put a tremendous burden on the

6

Government in proving a case that they would have to

7

prove knowledge of complex regulations.

8

Government has to prove is that the defendant knew that

9

what he was doing was unauthorized, was in a manner

What the
/

10

nonauthorized.

11

no more difficult than proving criminal intent in any

12

other case.

13

That doesn't mean that he has to -- it's

And the Government answers its own argument

14

when it then, in response to the examples that were

15

given about the possible reach of their interpretation,

16

keeps coming back with the argument that reasonable

17

people would have some suspicions in a case like this.

18

That precisely makes my point.

0

19

In any kind of case that the Government has

20

any business bringing under this criminal provision, you

21

have a situation -- basic fairness dictates that you

22

would have a situation where people would agree a

23

reasonable person should have some suspicions, should

24

have known that there was something wrong.

25

addition, you have the particular circumstance here of

And in

an enforcement program that gives extensive notice.

You

have visits, warning letters, et cetera, et cetera.

Sc

3

that it's particularly true in this case that wherever

4

the Government is reasonably directing enforcement, this

5

is net a tremendous burden

6

they’re violating the statute.

7

to prove knowledge that

The questioning about the grocer just points

8

out what the possible breadth of reach of the

9

Government’s interpretation is, and the regulations are

10

very thick indeed, and the statute is very complex.

11

searching for an example, on page 25 of ay brief T put

12

in an example about a particularly complex regulation

13

about an elderly person receiving an allotment because

14

he was a separate household from people that he was

15

living with.

16

meet those criteria, he would be acquiring his food

17

stamps in a manner not authorized by the statute.

18

And that’s the same example.

I,

If he didn’t

The Government probably reasonably wouldn’t

19

prosecute such a person; but I think that we've got tc

20

give a reading to the statute that wouldn’t allow such —

QUESTION;

MR. HUYCK:

QUESTION;

How dees that affect your client?
Pardon me?
Did your client get those

regulations?
MR. HUYCK;

No.

That’s —

QUESTIONi

Of course not.

He wasn’t

interested in them, was he?

3

MR. HUYCK;

That’s an example of someone who

4

could be prosecuted under the Government’s example --

5

reading of the statute; however, they probably never

6

would.

7

reading that Congress intended, reasonable requirement

8

of proof by the Government that people —

But I think, that the statute should be given the

9

QUESTIONS

Mr. Huyck, in your view would an

10

instruction by the court in this case telling the jury

11

that if the defendant had reason to know the stamps were

12

unlawfully acquired, would that have been sufficient in

13

your view?

14

MR. HUYCKs

Yes.

That would meet — I think

15

here again is a place where the Model Penal Code is

16

useful.
*

17

QUESTION:

So you don't think that it requires

18

actual knowledge.

19

it said having reason to know is sufficient.

20

You think it should be read as though

MR. HUYCK:

Yes.

I would commend to the trial

21

judge the Model Penal Code’s definitions here where they

22

make allowance for that kind of knowledge.

23

QUESTION:

Of course, you’re dealing with a

24

statute where the adverb is "knowingly."

25

you can very reasonably read the word "knowingly" into

It seems to me

54
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the second clause of the statute, or you can say there

2

is no intent requirement, because "knowingly" isn't

3

found in this.

4

to know, which is nowhere found in the statute, I don't

5

know .

6

But how you can say their having reason

MB. HUYCKi

Well, here again, if we’re going

7

to have an era where federal trial courts are going to

8

more precisely instruct juries on mental intent than

9

they have with this boilerplate instruction I used in

10

this case, probably there's going to have to be some

11

guidance.

12

Onion, I think 38 of them, they use the Model Penal

13

Code.

14

that.

15

And I think that in many states in this

We don't have a federal criminal code that does

But I think that this is a very good example

16

of how using the considered opinion of the American Law

17

Institute would bring about a good definition for a case

18

of this type.

19

The question was asked whether United States

20

Gypsum is dispositive here.

21

out about United States Gypsum is it’s one of three

22

cases — the Bailey case, the U.S. Gypsum case, and the

23

Freed case -- where this Court has addressed statutes

24

where no intent term is set forth and has adopted the

25

very reasonable positions of the Model Penal Code on

What I would like to point

(202) 628-9300

I

1

what kind of mental elements should be reasonably found

2

in a statute.

3

And I think that certainly the U.S. Gypsum

4

case stands for the proposition that if it’s a felony,

5

and cites the Model Penal Code for. this, you ought not

6

to be sending unknowing persons to prison for a felony

7

except in very limited circumstances.

8

very clear that the only limited circumstances this

9

Court has ever recognized are cases such as Yermian

And I think it's

10

where you’re talking about a jurisdiction, and the

11

dangerous instrumentality cases.

12

Thank you.’
