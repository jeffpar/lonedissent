The Sixth Circuit, we submit, was quite

11

correct when it stated in the Kramer case that

12

"Tradition for these purposes must be gauged in light of

13

what actually happened, and what happened is a federal

14

program, cf local transit services in which the states

15

participate as latecomer junior partners.

16

therefore, no tradition" -- and I’m still quoting from

17

the Sixth Circuit -- "cf the states qua states providing

18

mass transportation."

19

There is a related point.

There is,

Congress did not

have tc accomplish its mass transit spending objectives

21

the way the states requested.

Ke

Probably the dominant theme of the briefs
filed by the appellees and their amici is that the

10

ability cf state and lccal governments to make certain

11

policy choices otherwise available to them may be

12

impaired in the evert the federal government has the

13

authority to set wage rates for their employees.

14

a starting point that is a relevant argument, because we

15

agree that as this Court said in FESC v. Mississippi and

16

has repeated several times since, the authority tc make

17

policy choices, to make policy decisions is probably the

18

quintessential attribute of sovereignty.

19

find as

But we find it ironic that the appellees’

20

petition in this respect purports to be based on

21

federalism; because the authority to make fundamental

22

policy decisions is no less an essential attribute cf

23

sovereignty for Congress than it is for the states, and

24

both are affected by this case.

25

Because while it is true that SAMTA’s ability
7

tc make scire mass transit policy choices could be
affected -- the federal government regulates its wages
and hours -~ it is equally true that SAIuTA's wage and
hour decisions, if left tc their unfettered control, can
also limit Congress' ability tc regulate Congress.

And

the reason is that wage and hour decisions by a
publicly-owned mass transit employer have just as much
effect on interstate commerce as the same decisions, the
same wage and hour decision s by a non-gcvernmental mass
transit employer.
And if there is one thing that is clear
concerning Congress’ Commerce Clause prerogatives, it is
that the authority tc decide, the power tc decide
concerning the effects on interstate commerce, the
comparative effects of different kinds cf practices,
lies sclidly within Congress' stewardship.
And this brings us tc the crucial issue cf
what should be the governing ccnstituticnal standard.
The reason that there is a constitutional issue in this
case is that a central structural feature cf cur
Constitution is the side-by-side existence cf two sets
of governments.

And in any case like this one where you

have federal regulaticr under the Commerce Clause of the
states qua states,

then the complete and uninhibited

exercise of sovereign power by either cf these sets cf

1

governments creates a potential conflict with the

2

sovereign powers of the other.

3

constitutional problem, and if the governing

4

constitutional standard is to he adequate, it must take

5

that fact into account.

There is a rather

comprehensive body of law that has developed, including

this three-part test plus the balancing safety valve

an understanding as to what is meant by traditional.

There has been some reliance by the states cn that test,

And

Well, General lee, how does a fccus

10

on the historical services provided by a state serte tc

11

protect the more fundamental ability of the state to

12

make and carry out its policy choices as a sovereign?

13

I’m not sure that I understand how that serves us well

14

in protecting sovereign rights cf states.

15

• MR. LEE:

It serves tc protect sovereign

16

rights cf states and the sovereign rights of Congress,

17

Justice C'Conner, and this is absolutely fundamental to

18

our case, the answer tc that question.

19

We start from the premise, as I've just

20

developed, that the basic constitutional .problem is that

21

ours is a federal system, and that if ycu concentrate

22

only as my opponents do on the fact, with

23

nc dispute,

24

its powers can erode seme state prerogatives,

25

leads ycu in one direction.

which we have

that the unfettered exercise by Congress of

10

then that

Hr. Garcia, cr tie ether hand, focuses in his
brief cn an equally correct creposition, which is that
the unfettered exercise by the states cf their
prerogatives to make wage and hour decisions, if there
are no limitations, can alsc limit Congress' authority,
which it otherwise clearly has, to make decisions
concerning effects cn Congress.
Cur point cf view is that this Court really
did get it right when in Hodel v. Virginia Surface
Mining and three subsequent occasions it said that it's
to he -- that the -- that the test is tc be three parts
plus a balancing safety valve, which permits us to take
into account the fact that there is -- there is this
equipoise, there is this -- that there are these -- the
need to accommodate the competing interests of both
state and federal.
Now-, as to the -- as to the basis for the
historical test, we think that the historical test is
alsc sensitive tc the competing needs cf beth sets cf
governments; because on the one hand, once again, you
can say that regardless cf when the states come into the
field, that their problems do relate tc legitimate
police power objectives.

ME. LEE;

Well,

that is an issue, and that is

23

the perspective from what -- that -- that is the

24

question as placed in the perspective from the

25

appellees' standpoint.

But I can also say that there is
12

1

a question concerning the prerogative of the Congress to

2

set --

to regulate commerce.
The appellees have very properly raised the

3
4

question -- probably the dcirinant theme in the

5

appellees'

6

case,

7

particularly if -- if -- if our historical test is -- is

8

adopted, that this will freeze their prerogatives to

9

enter new fields.

briefs is a concern that if they lose this,

there will be an adverse impact on their --

hy answer to that, and to further answer to

10
11

your question,

12

in this historical test which freezes in any way or

13

adopts any kind of a-static view which prevents the

14

states from entering new fields.

15

when they do enter new fields, if it is a field that is

16

already subject to regulation ly Congress,

17

have to enter it subject to the same -- to some

18

reasonable Commerce Clause regulations of the same type

19

that their private competitors are already facing.

20

that is a principle that has been established by this

21

Court at least as early as 60 years ago in Helvering v.

22

Powers and has been reiterated numerous occasions since

23

then,

CIESTICK:

fchat is the — what, hr. Solicitor
13

1

General, is the competitor cf a private mass transit

2

system in today's terms?
KF. LEEi

3

What competitors are there?

Well, there -- cf course, at the

4

time -- at the present time, it is dominantly a field

5

that is dominated -- it is a field that is dominated by

6

public transit systems, though I would add quickly and

7

parenthetically that came alcut because of this mass --

8

this massive federal aid.
But at the time -- the issue really must be

9
10

gauged as of the time the states first entered the

11

field.

12

has there been a law -- is this a traditional

13

governmental function?

14

P.nd you have to ask in answering this question,

QUESTION;

hr. Solicitor General,

15

point troubles me.

16

the states or state by state?

17

that guestion, my next question would be-are you talking

18

about city by city or county by county, or what is the

19

limit cf the standards you advocate?

20
21

MR. LEEi

Are you talking about a majority cf

No.

as a national problem.

22

QUESTIONS

23

MR. LEEs

I

And before you answer

think you have to look at it

And I think --

A majority of the states?
I don’t think that you -- I don’t

24

thick that it would be profitable to lock at.

25

think it would be that helpful to look at in terms of a
14

I don’t

1

majority.

Indeed,

I would urge that that issue net be

2

reached in

this particular case, but that the only

3

decision that be reached in this particular case is that

4

where you have the circumstance that you had here where

5

prior to the massive federal aid, and indeed,

6

had federal regulation in the employment relations field

7

reaching back tc 15 2 5 and at least as early as 1561 that

8

you had-federal regulation applying to — to — to

9

transit employees, and a circumstance in which as cf 19

10

-- there simply was not a

11

simply were not well-established patterns of state

12

ownership already in the field at the time that the

13

federal government entered.

QUESTION;

Nr. Lee, I take it these questions,

16

for me anyway, raise a seccrdary question,

correct one.

and that is

I take it you feel it is.

ME. IEE;

Indeed I do. Justice Blackmun.

We

20

thir.k the entire approach is sound, and an integral part

21

of that approach is the third test which is the

22

traditional governmental functions test.

23
24
25

CIESTICN;

But this is why you’re getting

these questions from the bench.
MR. LEE;

That is correct.
15

Ihat is correct.

1

And I wish to emphasize that we do believe that that

2

test is a sound one, and it's sound for three reasons.

3

One is it has the force of precedent behind it.

4

second is that it is responsive to the basic underlying

5

constitutional problem.

6

problems under federalism that the states have or the

7

problems under federalism that the Congress has.

8

have to accommodate in some way both of them, and we

believe that this historical test acccrrplish.es that.

I -- I think I ought to tegin

which we all agree the

2

government has enumerated powers but is supreme within

3

those enumerated powers, and where the distinctive

4

feature is that the national government dees net have

5

plenary powers.
We believe that the argument for that

6
7

preposition has three basic components.

The first is

8

the language of the Supremacy Clause and of the Tenth

9

Amendments themselves.

The Supremacy Clause says this

10

Constitution and the laws of the United States which

11

shall be made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme

12

law of

13

any states to the contrary notwithstanding.

respectively or to the people."

18

the background,

19

does net say that the rational government shall have

20

plenary power, but rather enumerate certain powers,

21

including the power to regulate commerce, and which

22

includes also those powers necessary and proper to carry

23

out that basic authority -- an authority which was

Good morning, Mr.

questions:

commerce powers directly against the state to supplant

18

core state functions such as the establishment of wages,

19

Public transit,

I*d ask you to turn to page 2 of SANTA's

20

original brief tc shew you the legislative history.

21

Enacted in 1938, the Fair labor Standards

22

exempted all states and their political subdivis ions,

23

and all transit systems, public or private, from the

24

minimum wage and overtime previsions.

25

National Labor Relations Act, enacted in
25

Act expressly

furthermore, the
1935, exempts

1

all public agencies, including transit systems -- an

2

exemption that continues until today.
The first attempt to extend any Fair Labor

Standard previsions to any private transit provisions

5

was in

6

only to a few private systems -- those which had

7

revenues in excess of a million dollars.

9

to 1961, and you will realize that that meant that very

New, that

10

few private systems were covered.

Then, all public

systems remained completely exempt according to the

The city of Philadelphia -- the city of San

17

18

transit became well established as a common local

governmental service.

20

Thus, we have a picture where Congress expressly

By 1965,

In any event, this Court decisions rejects the

equation of traditional with, the passage of many

decades.

17

that even if the service is now supplied by most state

18

and local government, it is not traditional merely

19

because the current public sector pervasiveness does not

20

have ancient historic roots; that, in fact, in National

21

League of City, the services protected were defined

22

sometime as integral, ether times as important,

23

at other times as traditional.

24
25

The decisions do net support the suggestion

and also

Long Island Failrcad clearly states that
traditional — that traditional does net give rise tc an
30

1

historic test.

The Court held the same in New York v.

2

The United States.
I think in this case, Your Honors, these

3

systems had become public and were traditional even

5

before

6

7

it did net say that the systems had to abide by the Fair

In

And your cases make it clear --

10

Congress says that if you want the money, you have to

11

abide ty this condition, that ycu do net read

12

conditions, impose them on the local governments.

13

The other argument the Solicitor General makes

14

is that somehow you will have unfair•ccmpetiticn between

15

the private and the public systems if you don't apply

16

the Fair Labor Standards Act.
The language that he quotes in his brief, was

18

describing the situation in

In addition, I would just ask you to see

of them, the fact that there had been a lone history of

The fact that there were only two

I’d now like for a moment to turn to the

6
7

question of the federal constitutionalism which really

8

answers the argument made by the union.
It is clear that when the Constitution was set

9
10

up that states were to remain and they were to have

11

separate and independent existence.

12

if you don't have a constitutional federal limitation,

13

Congress could presumably even tax a percentage of all

14

revenues collected by state taxes.

If that's sc, then

In fact, I

10

stand before you and say that few such principles are
