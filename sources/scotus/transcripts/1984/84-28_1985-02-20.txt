We will hear arguments

MS. GREGOIRE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
With these consolidated cases, this Court has the
opportunity to assure state legislatures that they can and
should rely on the law of this Court.

The Washington State

Moral Nuisance Statute tracks this Court's three-pronged
definition of obscenity and for that reason Appellants
request this Court to declare it facially constitutional.
The judicial meaning of the term "prurient" at issue
herein was established in Roth, affirmed in Miller, and remain
unchanged today.

Prurient in the Washington statute means

what this Court said it meant in Roth and nothing more.

Thus,

the Appellate Court should be reversed for holding uncon­
stitutional that which this Court set forth in Roth, Footnote 2 0.

22

The case before the Court today involves a
23

challenge to the definition of one term in one element

24

of a four-element prong which comprises only one of a
25

three-pronged test in the definition of obscenity.

There

1

is no question that the Washington State statute contains

2

all three prongs, defining the term "obscenity," as was

3

contained in Miller.

4

one of the Washington State statute contains all four

5

elements that were present in Roth, affirmed in Miller.

There is no question that prong

The only issue is as to the definiton of one

6
7

term in one element, that of prurient.

Prurient in the

8

Washington statute is defined as that which incites

9

lasciviousness or lust.

10

Appellees contend and Appellants deny that

11

the term "lust" has a fixed meaning, that of healthy

12

or wholesome.

13

it did in Roth, Footnote 20.

14

to the term "prurient" like it has to the term "obscenity,"

15

a judicial meaning.

16

material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts.

17
18

Lust in the Washington statute means what
Therein this Court ascribed

This Court said that prurient was

We, therefore, contend, as the Solicitor General
concluded, that this Court said that prurient meant lustful.

19

We also believe, however, that as a result

20

of Footnote 20, this Court went on to approve a number

21

of adjectives which can be used to define the term "prurient",

22

all of which convey the same basic theme.

23

By Footnote 20 in Roth, we clearly know what

24

is not prurient.

25

in sex as

It is not a healthy, wholesome interest

contended by Appellees herein.

QUESTION:

1

2

May I ask -- May I interrupt just

for a second?

3

MS. GREGOIRE:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I wasn't sure that your briefs were

5

entirely consistent all the way through and what you

6

said the word "lust" meant.

7

this is filed by your co-counsel, not by you.

8

five you said, we urge that the prurient part of Miller's

9

three-part test as required only that the expression

In the blue brief -- I guess

10

in some significant way be erotic.

11

statement of your position?
MS. GREGOIRE:

12

Yes.

On page

Is that a correct

May I explain, Your Honor?

13

What we meant by that -- What co-counsel meant by that

14

is the purpose of the prurient element as contained in

15

prong one is to separate out that which is sexually stimulatin g

16

from that which is intellectually stimulating, separating

17

out protected and unprotected speech.

18

QUESTION:

Your view is that any time the material

19

is

20

aspect of your statute?

21

MS. GREGOIRE:

sexually

stimulating, then it satisfies the lust

It may satisfy prurient, Your

22

Honor, but not prong one, because when one looks further

23

at prong one and in specific contemporary community

24

standards element, one becomes very clear that the measure

25

that we have there is to measure that which offends.

1

That which offends, thus, can mean lustful, lascivious,

2

lewd, all the adjectives that are contained in Footnote

3

20, so long as it is clear that it is not healthy, wholesome,

4

or something similar of that nature.

5

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that something

6

that is erotic is or is not healthy?

7

clear.

8
9

MS. GREGOIRE:

I am not quite

If a juror, for example, was

to find that something was healthy just because it is

10

sexually stimulated, that would not meet prong one.

11

The juror must find that there is some sort of unhealthy,

12

unwholesome, lewd, lascivious type --

13
14

QUESTION:

Then in your view there is a requirement

that it be something more than sexually stimulating?

15

MS. GREGOIRE:

16

QUESTION:

Do you think that is consistent

17

with what the brief says?

18

That is your position.

19

20
21

22
23

That is correct, Your Honor.

MS. GREGOIRE:

Of course, it doesn't matter.

It is, Your Honor.

I believe

it is consistent with —
QUESTION:

Does it go as far as to require

that it be morbid and the other language?
MS. GREGOIRE:

What our contention is is that

24

Roth Footnote 20 did not give a fixed definition to the

25

term "prurient."

There were a number of adjectives -6

QUESTION:

Well, I am just asking what you

2

think your statute means, not what Roth, Footnote 20

3

means.

4

MS. GREGOIRE:

Your Honor, our statute means

5

what Roth, Footnote 20 means.

The authors of the statute

6

literally took the language from Roth, Footnote 20.

7

The first definition contained in the Footnote is lustful

thoughts.

9

we submit to you, clearly — virtually just lifted it

The authors of the statute in Washington,

10

out of that Footnote as they lifted the three-prong

11

definition out of Miller.

12

is what this Court said it is in Roth, Footnote 20.

14

QUESTION:

In other words, we should look to

that Footnote and not to the intent of your

Therefore, the definition

legislature?

They are one in the same is

our contention, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

Counsel, I am glad for your elucidation

18

here because I share Justice Stevens' concern.

19

that your position had changed in the paper submitted

20

here.

21

present position is.

22

I felt

I guess what we are interested in is what your

MS. GREGOIRE:

I apologize if we in some way

23

have mislead you.

24

trying to distinguish what the purpose of prurient element

25

is, i.e., to separate out that which is sexual stimulation

That was not our intention.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

We were

1

from intellectual stimulation, but that in and of itself

2

cannot meet prong one.

3

It must be as this Court said in Footnote 20, lustful,

4

lascivious, what-have-you, clearly not healthy, wholesome

5

interest in sex.
QUESTION:

6
7

10

MS. GREGOIRE:

It is, Your Honor.

In the trial

court and in the Court of Appeals we have always maintained
that --

11
12

Is that what you argued in the Court

of Appeals?

8
9

There must be something more.

QUESTION:

I surely didn't get that impression

I must say.
MS. GREGOIRE:

13

Your Honor, our briefs will

14

bear that out; that we did argue that in both the trial

15

court and in the Ninth Circuit.

16

wholesome interest sex was insufficient to met prong

17

one.

18

Simple, healthy,

The Washington statute itself means by the

19

term "prurient," as I submit to Justice Stevens, that

20

which the Court meant in Roth, Footnote 20.

21

be any question as to how a juror, as Appellees suggest,

22

might understand that definition, we submit that that

23

is properly conveyed to those jurors by means of a jury

24

instruction.

25

Should there

Surely by jury instruction can a trial

of the term "prurient."

2

that a trial court would charge a jury but refuse to

3

instruct on the judicial meaning in light of this Court's

4

decisions in Roth and Miller and a state court decision

5

which we referred to in our brief.

It is unreasonable to assume

6

It is reasonable to assume that when this Court

7

rules in this case that the Washington courts will follow

8

the rule of this Court as well.

9

It is clearly not intended, we submit, by Roth,

10

Footnote 20, that prurient should convey a healthy,

11

wholesome interest in sex.

12

the case law upon which the court relied in formulating

13

what is now prong one of the three-prong test.

14

of those cases we have submitted in our brief make clear

15

what the court had in mind when it developed prong one

16

and the definition of prurient.

interest in sex.

Thus, prong one was what the law court

2

intended purpose to separate out protected and unprotected

speech.

QUESTION:

May I ask one other question because

I did have difficulty with this.

with Professor Showers' view of what the first prong

is all about?

Showers' view, that it can contain healthy, wholesome,
no, we do not.

QUESTION:

You quoted him in your Footnote

7 of your reply brief.

That is what I thought was your

13

position but I guess it is not.
«

14

MS. GREGOIRE:

but not the meaning of prong one.

That is correct.

or appeals to sex as Roth said is only the beginning

6

of the inquiry for a juror with reference to prong one.

Contemporary community standards then must measure that

That is then to be measured by the average person con­

12

Prurient, as I said earlier, in the Washington

13

statute means what this Court said it meant in Roth.

unconstitutional applications of the statute based on

prurient alone.

The Appellate Court, we submit, erred, holding

21

specifically that it was unnecessary to find substantial

22

overbreadth.

23

Appellants contend in this, a facial challenge,

24

there must be a showing of substantial overbreadth as

25

found in Ferber and cannot be found here when one looks

(202) 628-9300

1

at the statute as a whole, all four elements of prong

2

one, coupled with prongs two and prongs three of Miller.

3

One other aspect of the case before this Court

4

is that it deals with the respective roles of state and

5

federal courts.

6

request this Court to hold the statute facially

7

constitutional, if it is unclear in the minds of this

8

Court as to the meaning to be ascribed to the term "lust"

9

by the Washington court, we respectfully request that

While Appellants herein respectfully

the state courts be allowed to construed in this, a facial

11

challenge to a state statute.

12

proper course of action for three reasons.

13

This, we submit, is a

First, the Washington State moral nuisance

14

law before this Court literally tracks Roth and Miller.

15

It contains all three prongs and all four elements of

16

prong one.

17

Two, we submit one must presume that the state

18

legislature intended the statute to be constitutional

19

and such is obvious when one looks to the statute as

20

a whole and finds that it literally lifted the definition

21

of "prurient" from Roth and the definition of "obscenity"

22

from Miller.

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. GREGOIRE:

25

QUESTION:

May I ask one other question?
Yes, sir.

I was just reading the first question

presented in your jurisdictional statement.

5

saying that

You are

is the right definition.

6

MS. GREGOIRE:

7

QUESTION:

8

It is "May

We are not --

You are saying they forced you to

adopt the definition you now say is the correct definition.

9

MS. GREGOIRE:

Sir, we are not saying that

10

the only definition is morbid or shameful.

11

submitting to this court is that in Roth, Footnote 20,

12

the Court used a number of adjectives, possibly a continuum,

13

if you will, that accepts shameful and morbid as well --

14

QUESTION:

What we are

Surely it would violate the statute

15

if it met that test.

16

would it also violate the statute if it did not meet

17

that test but merely was normal and healthy interest

18

in sex?

19

20

But, what I am really asking is

Would that violate the first prong?
MS. GREGOIRE:

It is our contention it would,

Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

22

prong does not require proof of the morbid interest in

sex.

1

2

MS. GREGOIRE:

Let me attempt to be responsive

to your question, Your Honor.

3

What we are contending here is that the Court

4

did not fix a definition of "prurient" as shameful or

5

morbid.

6

term "prurient" in Roth, Footnote 20.

7

described or defined by lustful, lascivious, lewd, itching,

8

longing, all the terms contained there, so that it is

9

clear that the theme is conveyed to the juror that it

10

11
12

It is one of the acceptable definitions of the
It can also be

is something clearly not healthy, not wholesome.
QUESTION:

Well, does it or does it not require

a morbid interest in sex.

13

MS. GREGOIRE:

14

QUESTION:

It may.

I really think the question you

15

have presented -- You say the Court of Appeals forces

16

you to take an interpretation of the statute which you

17

said is correct all along.

18

MS. GREGOIRE:

The Court of Appeals said that

19

the only definition of "prurient" was shameful or morbid.

20

We submit that is not the only --

21

QUESTION:

Were they correct in saying that

22

a healthy interest in sex is also a permissible definition

23

of lust within the meaning of your statute?

24

MS. GREGOIRE:

25

QUESTION:

No.

Is there something in between a morbid
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

interest and a healthy interest?

2

MS. GREGOIRE:

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. GREGOIRE:

Yes, Your Honor, there is.

Would you explain it to me?
What we submit the contemporary

5

community standards element of prong one is intended

6

to convey to the average juror is that they must find

7

by the prurient element that which offends.

8

that specifically articulated what is the specific words

9

that one would use to define prurient.

It is not

Roth, Footnote

10

20, uses a number of adjectives, but Roth footnote also

11

makes clear they have to convey a basic theme and that

12

theme cannot be healthy, wholesome.

13

else.

14

is only one acceptable definition of prurient as Appellees

15

contend and the Appellate Court found, namely, shameful,

16

morbid.

It must be something

But at no time has this Court said that there

17

We submit it can be as the Washington statute

18

found, lust, lasciviousness, or it could be some of the

19

other adjectives that are used in Footnote 20, but this

20

Court has not said it is only shameful or morbid.

21

was the finding of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals

22

That

and Appellees' contention herein.

23

The third reason why we submit that if there

24

is any question before this Court as to the definition

25

of lust before the Washington State courts would be
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

appropriate is that the highest state court in Washington

2

has already held a predecessor statute to be required

3

to be construed consistent with this Court's decisions

4
5

in both Roth and Miller.
If allowed, we submit, it is reasonable to

6

assume that the state court in Washington would construe

7

constitutionally the definition of the term "lust."

8
9
10
11

I have three points I would like to convey
to the Court by way of conclusion.

First, it is the

request of the Appellants herein that the Washington
State statute be declared facially constitutional because

12

it tracks Roth and Miller in the definition of obscenity.

13

The definition of prurient in the Washington statute

14

means what this Court meant by its use of lust and

15

lascivious in Roth.

16

wholesome, nor has this Court ever said that the term

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Clearly it does not mean healthy,

"prurient" can have only one definition, shameful, morbid.
By Roth, Footnote 20, there are a number of
alternative adjectives that can be used and the Washington
State statute took the first, if you will, the definition
out of Roth, that which incites lustful thoughts.
QUESTION:

Ms. Gregoire, may I inquire whether

in your view in addition to the requirement that the
matter appeal to the prurient interest the statute also
requires that in any event to be covered the matter has
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

to depict or describe the specific listed act in the

2

statute.

3

MS. GREGOIRE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

4

It is Appellant's contention herein that even if prong

5

one were to include or to be over-inclusive that that

6

over-inclusiveness possibility is virtually eliminated

7

when one applies prong two, the patently offensive test,

8

and eliminated when one applies prong three, the serious

9

literary, scientific, artistic prong.

10

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that

11

there was overbreadth and that was the basis on which

12

they relied to overturn the Washington State statute.

13

We submit overbreadth simply cannot be substantial

14

is unclear as to the definition to be ascribed to the

term "lust" by the Washington Court, that that clarification

be left to the state court in this, a facial challenge,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. WESTON, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

3
4
5

MR. WESTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
By defining prurient exclusively in terms of

6

lust or lasciviousness, instead of the required shameful

7

and morbid interest in sex, the Washington legislature

8

impermissibly expanded the scope of its obscenity statute

9

rendering it invalid in every application.

10

Appellants have claimed in this Court and

11

modified their earlier position substantially in their

12

reply brief which was just recently submitted basically

13

to concede that prurient must mean a shameful or morbid

14

interest in sex, but that in some fashion not quite made

15

clear that lust and lasciviousness necessarily mean the

16

same as shameful and morbid.

17

In response to the Court's questions this morning,

18

Appellants have suggested that a trier of fact will

19

necessarily be instructed to imply lust or lasciviousness,

20

somehow necessarily add to that determination the terms

21

"shameful" and "morbid" while other terms conveying a

22

necessary unhealthy or pathological or diseased treatment

23

or interest in sex.

24
25

It seems to me that Appellants' suggestion
that the application of contemporary standards separates
19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

from any definition whatsoever, from anything to which

2

the contemporary standards apply.

3

that contemporary standards will be measuring except

4

for the terms "lust" and "lascivious" which we have --

5

QUESTION:

In other words, anything

Mr. Weston, what about the rest

6

of the statute that lists various specific acts and matters

7

which have to be depicted?

I mean, you have to look at it as

15

a whole which is what the state is arguing and that makes

16

some sense, doesn't it?

17

MR. WESTON:

It makes sense, Your Honor, except

18

in the context of the many, many years that obscenity

19

definitions which have pointed out that each of the tests,

20

each of the three tests in the familiar tripartite

21

definition of obscenity is separate and all three of

22

the tests must be met, must coalesce, in order for there

23

to be a constitutional finding of unprotectedness.

25

QUESTION:

And you are urging that we may not

2

MR. WESTON:

The statute -- If any of the three

3

elements of the obscenity statute is constitutionally

4

deficient by definition then, the statute cannot be

5

constitutional in that since each of the three tests

6

is independent, since each of the three tests must be

7

met in order for material to be obscene, the statute

8

then must fall because of --

9
10

QUESTION:

Nothing in the case is required

quite that microscopic on examination, I don't think.

11

MR. WESTON:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if I may

12

suggest, the case most on all fours with this would be

13

Marks versus United States, a case which involved this

14

Court's reversal of a federal obscenity prosecution where

15

the conduct had occurred under the more liberal standard

16

of Roth, Memoirs prior to this Court's construction in

17

Miller and in Hamling.

QUESTION:

There we were construing a federal

19

statute.

21

of the statute and said we have to analyze the statute

Washington case.

4

O'Connor's question as to why an invalidity in one of

formulation.

14

The indictment was tried under a much

The court held without reviewing the material

15

in question that because one of the three prongs that

16

was used, one of the three tests for obscenity in the

17

tripartite test, because that was constitutionally

18

deficient, the matter had to be reversed as well as any

19

other cases which had been tried under the similiarly

20

deficient standard.

21

QUESTION:

If there is this much argument about

22

what the statute means, why shouldn't it have been sub­

23

mitted to the Washington court?

MR. WESTON:

MR. WESTON:

Forgive me, Justice Rehnquist,

I was just trying to gauge my available time.

3

QUESTION:

I see.

When we are having a counsel

here from a state taking a position as to what the state

5

legislature meant, ordinarily we give considerable deference

6

to the state attorney's view as to what the state legislature

7

meant.

8
9

MR. WESTON:

Justice Rehnquist, let us assume

for the moment that this statute provided a penalty provision

10

for a mandatory death sentence in the case of somebody

11

convicted of violating the obscenity law and we challenged

12

that statute on a number of grounds, one, because perhaps

13

it imposed an impermissible chilling effect and perhaps

14

under Solon versus Helmet rendered it somewhat violative

15

of the Eighth Amendment.

16

entertain, and I ask this rhetorically with all due respect,

17

the representations of the state representatives to say

18

that the legislature did not really mean what they said

19

and that the case should go back to the state court for

20

come clarification of an ambiguity which appeared nowhere

21

else except in the minds of the state lawyers?

22

not, Your Honor.

23

Would the Court seriously

I think

This is a statute which clearly and unambiguously

24

states two words.

25

those two words, neither of which is particularly arcane

It defines prurient exclusively in

or unusual such as the word "prurient," which I think

2

we would all agree appears nowhere else in the English

3

language except for the opinions of this Court and obscenity

4

litigation and legislation.

5

Rather, this legislature ignored all of those

6

other potential definitions which has permeated this

7

Court's opinions and the state statutes of most states,

8

certainly up to the time of the 1973 Miller decisions.

9

It is significant to note that in seven of the eight

10

cases which formed the basis of the Miller quintet,

11

Capitol versus California, Miller versus California,

12

Paris versus Slaton, Oreto 12-200 Foot Reels, Heller

13

versus New York, and Alexander versus Virginia.

14

of those eight cases involve statutory definitions of

15

prurient defined as shameful or morbid and the federal

16

cases have been going to trial, they all have gone to

17

trial on the basis of shameful and morbid because those

18

were the federal jury instructions.

Seven

Subsequently, the next cases to reach this

20

Court, Hamling and Jenkins, both of which — Hamling

21

22

statute which simply defines prurient as shameful and

23

morbid.

24
25

With all due respect, that term has acquired
a judicial meaning as a term of art and for the state

Obviously, Younger versus Harris has no application

Let us quickly take a look at that

to see if it applies.

I think essentially it does not.

13

Most recently this Court through Justice O'Connor dealt

14

in the Hawaii Housing Authority case with a challenge

to a Hawaiian legislation where not only did the parties

but the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals suggest

that this was a case that was somehow susceptible to

Unequivocally, this Court noted that Pullman
abstention was a limited doctrine to be applied only
in limited circumstances and that the term "criteria,"
which must be met before Pullman abstention could be
utilized were, one, uncertainty, ambiguity in the meaning
of the statute and the possibilty of some readily available,

The Constitution

The part of the argument is

10

that the other two prongs are relevant to that, sufficiently

11

offensive to satisfy the second prong and totally without

12

artistic value.

13
14

MR. WESTON:

We can try to discuss that but

it would seem to me that merely valueless material, material

15

which is written by a bad author or somebody -- or a

16

painting painted by an unartistic artist will not in

18
19

21

22
23
24
25

any sense guarantee or even suggest that a work should
be offensive.

It is just without talent.

As to the "B" prong, the "B" prong under the
Miller formulation as noted quite clearly by the Chief
Justice in Miller was basically for a notice provision.
Firstly, the material is not taken in its entirety.
It is very clear that the taken-as-a-whole requirement
is present only with respect to the first prong, the
prurient prong, and also the last prong.

That is the

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

As to the rest, it is simply candor, whether
for notice purposes there appears in the work -- whether
the work depicts or describes what has been characterized
as a patently offensive manner explicit descriptions
of sex.

But, patently offensive in this format simply

refers under the new Miller formulation to degree of
candor.

That is all it can mean.

To the extent that

there is to be gauged social attitudes, community values
or attitudes, it required, once the Hicklin test was
rejected as discussed in our brief, that that determination
of unhealthy or rejection by the community in terms of
its attitude be applied to the work taken in its entirety
and not to some isolated section.

Therefore, the only

portion of the obscenity test which considers the work
taken as a whole and which can measure community value
has to be the prurient prong.
We have had a candid statement in this Court
from Appellants that they concede that the lust or
lascivious portion simply refers in and of itself to
a normal, healthy interest in sex, but somehow in some
other somewhat unexplained fashion that a trier of facts
or an artist who is trying to interpret the statute or
in the language of Justice O'Connor in Pohlander a police

officer, a prosecutor and a juror and a judge who have

to enforce the statute will somehow know that although

3

the legislature has rejected all these other terms and

4

substituted the exclusive words "lustful" or "lascivious"

5

which we now know mean a normal, healthy interest in

sex, that somehow they are to read something else into

this, that it really means a shameful or perverted or

11

the community finds that sexual response to be perfectly

12

acceptable, perfectly tolerable, and well within the

13

range of acceptance of that community and that renders

14

the whole statute invalid just as -- Justice O'Connor,

15

if I may try it a slightly different way, suppose instead

16

of defining prurient in this impermissible way, the State

17

of Washington used shameful and morbid, but provided

that the relevant community would include minors, thereby

noted extensively in U.S. versus Pincus, a 1977 or 1978
case.
Now, the same argument, Justice O'Connor, that
you are making with respect to that, to this case, would
be made I assume with respect to that, that what difference
does it make if the "A" prong, the prurient prong, has

been unconstitutionally expanded way beyond what the

Constitution permits, because the "B" prong satisfies

Similarly, if the material appeals to a prurient interest,

if it lacks serious value, but it doesn't contain patently

offensive depictions, it may not be found to be obscene

13

regardless of the other two prongs being satisfied.

And, in this sense, if material contains patently offensive

depictions or descriptions of sex, of ultimate sex acts,

16

and if it lacks serious artistic, political and scientific

value but it does not appeal to a shameful or morbid

18

or pathological interest in sex, then it may not be suppressed,

19

it may not be constitutionally found to be obscene or

the constitutional determination of obscenity stands

What is your view

Court in its initial opinion discussed certification

14

with respect to not this section, provision before us,

15

but another provision of this multi-sectioned bill.

16

The District Court noted that Washington does have a

17

certification provision.

certification provision is really for uncertainty or

19

ambiguity, the kind of thing, as we read it, that really

Do you have anything

further?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE 0. GREGOIRE
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT — REBUTTAL
MS. GREGOIRE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Just a couple of brief comments if you will.

14

Contrary to the assertion of Appellees before this Court

15

this morning, this Court has never said that prurient

16

is defined only by use of the terms "shameful" or "morbid."

17

In truth and in fact, in Roth, Footnote 20, this Court

18

clearly defined it as meaning lustful thoughts.

19

Washington State statute means what this Court meant

20

in Roth, Footnote 20.

The

21

Again, I submit that rather than taking the

22

view of Appellees that wedissect the statute not only

23

by element but we dissect it by virtue of the application

24

of the three prongs. It is clear that when one looks

25

at obscenity law one does so by looking at the entire
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

statute, that any over-inclusiveness that one might find

2

by virtue of the first element, prurient element, of

3

four elements in prong one are readily met unlike that

4

contention of Appellees by applying prong two, the patently

5

offensive prong, and prong three, the serious literary,

6

scientific --

7

QUESTION:

How do you respond on that argument

8

to his point that one paragraph out of a 200-page book

9

would satisfy prong two but not prong one?

10

11

MS. GREGOIRE:

Your Honor, I submit to you

that I am totally unaware of any such hypothetical.

12

QUESTION:

It is true, is it not, that the

13

taken-as-a-whole language appears only in Part A of your

14

statute.

15
16

MS. GREGOIRE:
Your Honor.

It does not appear in Part —

17

QUESTION:

MS. GREGOIRE:

consistent with Miller.

20

It appears in Part A and C,

QUESTION:

It does not appear in Part B?
That is correct and that is

I understand, but then isn't it

21

true then that the Part B is satisfied by a short paragraph

22

in a long book?

23

MS. GREGOIRE:

I don't believe that that would

24

comply with Part Two or Prong B as Appellees suggest.

25

I don't believe that that necessarily would, Your Honor,

and let's assume that for the moment that it did, again,

2

Appellees' wish to dissect and separate all three prongs

3

of the definition of obscenity and look only to prong

4

two or prong "B", irrelevant of prong one and irrelevant

5

on prong three.

QUESTION:

Well, don't you agree there are

three independent tests that must be met?
MS. GREGOIRE:

The three must be met and taken

as a whole.

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. GREGOIRE:

12

QUESTION:

That each must be met?
Yes.

If you have to look at the work

13

as a whole, Part B can't satisfy the first prong, isn't

14

that right?

15
16
17
18

MS. GREGOIRE:

Part B does not have to be taken

as a whole language, that is correct.

So that cannot satisfy the taken-as-

a-whole element with the first prong?

19

MS. GREGOIRE:

20

But, again, we submit that if this Court was

That is correct, Your Honor.

21

to look at the statute as a whole and the fact that the

22

Washington State legislature literally lifted the language

23

contained in Miller and literally lifted the language

24

contained in Roth, and what the Washington State legislature

25

did is follow the dictates of this Court and it seems
