ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 83-1070

8

MR. KLEIN:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please

the Court, there are two issues in this case.

11

The first deals with the constitutionality of a state

12

statute with regard to the use by a police officer of

13

all necessary means to effect an arrest.
The second is whether the municipality's use

14
15

of deadly force to apprehend a fleeing burglary suspect

16

after exhausting all other reasonable means is

17

constitutionally permissible.
The reason the city asked for certiorari in

18
19

this case is that it has a substantial public interest

20

in being able to apprehend persons fleeing from serious

21

crimes such as burglary in the first degree.
The facts in this case are such that they lend

22
23

themselves to show that the officer involved had

24

probable cause to believe that a felony had teen

25

involved, and as I pointed

little or any question that at the time the officer

more to believe that a burglary in the first degree had

Burglary in the first degree under Tennessee

19

law is the breaking and entering in a dwelling place in

the nighttime with intent tc commit a felony, and the

21

Tennessee legislature has determined that burglary is a

serious crime, which, if nothing more, is evidenced by

23

the fact that i± carries of not less than five, no mere

than 15 years.

the fence there was growth -- I think he described it

11

Johnson grass -- which was rather tall, that he knew

12

that once the individual got beyond the fence, there was

13

no chance for him to apprehend, and that’s the reason

14

that he used the deadly force to attempt to apprehend.

15

New, in the court proceedings below, the

16

District Court found in favor of all defendants.

17

in the original action was the City of Memphis, the

18

individual officer who was on the scene, and two

19

supervisory personnel.

20

Named

The case was appealed to the Sixth Circuit

21

Court of Appeals, and was sent back because in the

22

meantime this Court had decided the Mar.ell case,

23

that the Court of Appeals decided that the case should

24

be remanded in light of Manell to further consider

25

whether there was any liability on the part of the

The judgment as tc the individual defendants

was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.

reconsidered by the District Judge, and again the

District Judge found that the city was not liable, found

in favor of the city, and the case went up again.

7

The case was

The second time the court declared that the
!

8

Tennessee statute allowing the use of deadly force was

9

unconstitutional.

The reasons given were that it did

10

not put sufficient limits on the use of deadly force, it

11

was toe disproportionate, and it did not make

12

distinctions on the magnitude of the offenses.

QUESTION:

14

HR. KLEIN:

15

QUESTION:

Hr. Klein -Yes, sir.
-- did the Court of Appeals say

16

that the statute was unconstitutional across the beard

17

or on its face, or did it just say it couldn’t

constitute a defense in this action?

MR. KLEIN:

It said it is unconstitutional

across the board.
QUESTION:

Did it intimate that there was some

First Amendment problem involved here?
MR. KLEIN:

No, sir, there was no indication.

that the court used for declaring it unconstituticra 1.

The standard which the Court of

Appeals used

7

was based upon the Model Eenal Code.

position that the Model Penal Code was implemented to be

It is the city’s

10

purpose cf the Model Penal Code should be as a guide to

11

legislatures in the event they see fit to enact

12

legislation to cover situations such as this.
The reasons the city disagreed with the Sixth

13
14

Circuit opinion are, first,

the city feels strongly that

15

the court erred in concluding that this was not a

16

serious crime.

17

crime involved was burglary in the first degree.

18

the court doesn't really deal with why it considered the

19

crime tc be nonviolent.

20

so-called property crime.

Again, I emphasize and reiterate, the
And

They did label it as a

Also, the city feels that the standard which

21

22

was imposed, which was that which is based upon the

23

Model Penal Code, is an impediment to apprehension.

24

Eecause cf the standards placed under the Model Penal

25

Code,

it puts an undue burden on law enforcement in
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

situations such as this in attempting to apprehend

2

fleeing felons.
Because of the standards set cut in the Model

3
4

Penal Cede, it requires a police officer to make an on

5

the spot constitutional analysis and still react to the

6

exigencies of an emergency situation.
Because of these standards set cut by the

7

8

Sixth Circuit, it is difficult to determine how an

9

officer will ever know reasonably or otherwise if the

10

felon is allowed to escape whether he will ever again be

11

free tc commit another crime if not apprehended.
QUESTION:

I am just wondering, what is the penalty under

command to halt.

QUESTIONi

17

MR. KLEIN:

Yes.
If Ycur Honor please, that is —

18

there is a city ordinance which covers that, but it is a’

It is not a state violation.

4

That’s right.

But if he can

apprehend him, basically you are telling me there really

is ro legislative deterrent other than the threat that

7

if you don’t get away you might get shot.

8

ME. KLEIN:

9

QUESTION:

10

That’s correct, sir.
What is the penalty for first

degree burglary?
ME. KLEIN:

11

Not less than five nor more than

12

15 years.

And if a weapon is involved, it becomes net

13

less than ten nor more than

MR. KLEIN:

Nc more than 40?
Fifteen, sir.
When a weapon is involved?
there a weapon is involved, not

18

less than ten nor more than 15 years, if a weapon is

19

involved, sc the Tennessee statute makes it even a mere

20

serious crime if a

21

weapon is involved.

The city further contends that what the Sixth

22

Circuit has dene is imposed a standard which should be

23

left to the legislature.

24

standard of public policy, and it is the position of the

25

city that this is something that should be left tc the

It is a standard of morals, a

What the court did was, under the guise cf

constitutional -- is imposing upon the various states

4

which wculd le involved its own standards.

5

the level of crime which would justify use cf force

6

should

Furthermore,

also be left to the legislature.

7

Tennessee has determined that burglary is a

8

serious crime, and therefore it makes it all the mere

9

important that in a situation such as this, that the

10

right to apprehend is compelling, and is certainly a

11

compelling state interest.

12

The legislature has an interest in protecting

13

its citizens against burglaries.

Cf course, we confine

14

ourselves to the facts of this particular case, and when

15

we talk in terms of compelling state interest as opposed

16

to the rights of the individual, the city takes the

17

position that the individual burglar has nc

18

constitutional right to commit burglary and escape the

19

consequences, and be has nc constitutional right tc flee

20

frem burglary when tcld to stop.

r

21

And in this particular situation, when the

22

police officer arrived on the scene, all the individual

So, really, there are two things that are

involved from the standpoint of the individual.

He has

3

put himself in the position ty committing the burglary,

4

which he takes to do himself, and certainly assumes a

5

certain risk of what might happen when he does put

6

himself in that position, and, then secondly, when told

7

to stop, all he has to do is stop, and the matter is at

8

an end .

18

the courts in interpreting the state law, and again, the

19

state law is really the common law, and the courts in

20

interpreting the state law have said even

21

1879 in the case of Reneau versus State that the statute

22

only intended that the use of deadly force be against

the word "sericus."

What they said in Feneau versus

2

State is that if there were certain crimes of lesser

of felonies, but if there were certain felonies of

5

25

And we submit that the answers to these

1

questions will turn cn an understanding and a

2

recognition of the state's substantial interest in b-eing

3

able tc apprehend serious criminals and preserve the

4

public

5

safety.
It is the position of the state that Section

6

40-‘7-10£ of the Tennessee Code, which is generally an

7

embodiment of the common law rule as it has been

8

construed over the years by the Tennessee Supreme Court,

9

is constitutional as applied to the facts of this case,

10

and as I Have indicated, I think there are serious

11

considerations before the Court.

12

'

The ethical and the moral judgments of public

13

policy that a society must make are judgments we believe

14

better made in the state legislature than in the federal

court,

18

and does not amount, as has been suggested, to

punishment of the suspect.

20

and the ability cf the state to effectively

And in balancing the interests in this case,

21

we are talking about that substantial state interest in

22

apprehending criminal suspects measured against the

23

right cf the criminal, who can lawfully submit tc arrest

24

and possibly lose his liberty, tecause if he submits to

2

tc disregard the lawful order of the police and risk the

3

possible losing of his life if in the apprehension

4

process the force that was used was deadly force.
These questions, we believe, under the

5

6

Fourteenth Amendment will allow this Court to recognize

7

that the felon should net have a right to unwarranted

8

protection from apprehension which would jeopardize the

9

public security in not being able to bring a criminal tc

10

justice.
It is the apprehension process that is

11
12

necessary before any of the ether criminal justice

13

procedures can come into play, and unless the state is

14

able tc recognize and to implement its substantial

15

interest in arresting and apprehending felonies,

16

the state has lost forever its ability to do that.

then

17

And the rule which would allow a fleeing felon

18

to disregard the fact and to say that the police have no

will encourage in property crimes or burglary crimes as

21

we have here, will encourage the criminal to run each

he could have been treated as an adult at that time, but

the Tennessee statute,

which is 37-234, specifically
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

specifically excluded burglary as one of these crimes

for which a 15-year-old could be bound over to the adult

could have teen treated as an adult for murder, but not

MR. WINTER:

There are problems with the

court's formulation, I would agree, but I think the

essential import of what the court was- saying is clear,

6

and that is that as applied to these facts, certainly,

7

where the officer testified that he knew the juvenile to

is unconstitutional.

Ycu would agree, then, that if the

reasonally sure that Garner was unarmed, and finally, on

whether cr net he was armed, he answered, I assumed that

7

In our.view, this case presents really three

issues fer the Court to determine.

There is a

10

constitutionality of the state statute and the municipal

11

policy as applied tc this case, given the facts, a

12

nonviolent, nondangerous fleeing property crime

13

suspect.
There is the question of the constitutionality

14
15

of the city's policies and customs that encourage, in

16

fact, encourage and insulate the use of excessive fcrce

17

where officers do not exhaust reasonable alternatives.
And finally, the question of whether the

18
19

Memphis policy is in violation of the Fourteenth

20

Cur position before this Court on the first

21

issue,

MR. WINTER*

There is no doubt that burglary

is both a serious crime and a frightening crime.

10

Indeed, the reason why burglary is punished severely in

11

our society is because all cf us feel the sanctity cf

12

our home violated and all cf us are very frightened by

13

the prospect of a stranger coming in at night.

14

We have no quarrel with burglary being treated

15

as a serious crime under state law and lengthy

punishments being imposed.

sufficiently substantial to justify the taking of life.

That was not in effect

1974, but it was adopted — well, I may be wrong cn
Perhaps 1979.
With regard to the Tennessee statute and

whether it only covers serious crimes or nonserious

7

crimes, we would draw the Court's attention tc Fage

1,460 in the Court of Appeals record, which is a listing

of every nonviolent property crime suspect shot at by

10

the Memphis police between

1969 and

1975.

This listing was prepared by Captain Colleta

of thei

Memphis Police Eepartment.

for such circumstances as a prowler who is stealing from

a car let.
QUESTION;

15

It lists shootings

Are you suggesting that in every

instance the particular policeman whc shot was acting in

17

conformity with the Tennessee law?
MR. WINTER;

18

Kell, we suggest that in many

19

instances, whatever the Tennessee law may be on the

20

books,

21

the cases, it is not the practice under either the

22

Tennessee law cr the Memphis policy to restrict

23

shootings only to serious and dangerous people.

That might be useful evidence in

your attack on the Memphis practice. It is certainly not

ME. WINTER:

No, hut we bring it to the

Court’s attention because the argument that the

5

Tennessee statute is somehow sufficient to prevent these

unconstitutional sheetings and that the Court need net

8

the practice and the record.
People who have stolen checks have been shot

at by Memphis police.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY L. KLEIN, ESQ.,

Dc yen have anything

ON

EEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN 83-1070 - REBUTTAL
MR. KLEIN:

5

In response to Justice O'Connor's

6

guesti on earlier about whether cr net any states have

7

adopte d the Model Penal Code and whether it proved

8

satisf actory, it is cur understanding that both Idaho

9

and Ne w York, had adopted the Mcdel Penal Cede, but later

10

Ida ho has reverted back to the common law, which is the

11

same a s what Tennessee has, and that New York now has

12

som eth ing in between which is referred to as a forcible

13

feleny

statute.
With regard to the penalty that would come

14
15

into p lay just for net stopping, and that is true, that

16

is — and I think I have pointed that out earlier, that

17

is jus t a $50 fine, but we again want to emphasize that

18

vha t i s in progress is a burglary, and that is a

19

contin u 5us violation from the time that there is the

20

br eaki ng and entering which is known tc the pelice

21

office r through the attempt to apprehend.
QUESTION:

22

Yes,,tut cf course he wouldn’t he

23

25

MR. KLEIN;

He is shot because he tried

That is correct, hut he is

escaping from a serious crime, which is burglary.
QUESTION:

2

I understand, but it still puzzles

3

me that the legislature didn’t make that a serious crime

4

as vel 1, because I think that is a sericus matter.
ME. KLEIN:

5

Well, of course, the point of all

6

of this, and this gets back to what states adopt what,

7

really what may be good in Idaho may not be good in

8

California, cr vice versa, and that is cur argument

9

about these policy questions.

Not only does it relate

10

to the state and the legislature, but also to the city

11

of Memphis.

12

particular problems are and what policies it needs tc

13

enforce, and that is our argument with the Sixth Circuit

14

Court of Appeals.

And that each state has to gauge what its

QUESTION :

15

Yes, but I would suppose you would

16

agree that the state could not adopt a statute making it

17

a capital offense tc flee in these circumstances.

18

19

QUESTION:

20

That is. correct.

That would be --

Sc there are some limits cn the

state’s power.

in the state, they are all subject tc certain minimal

constitutional guarantees.

24

framework, and if a state gets out of bounds or out of

25

whack,

We have tc work within that

then they are subject tc those restrictions.
