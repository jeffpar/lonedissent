QUESTION;

Is it possible that the bullet

MR. GARRETT:

6

I don't think it would probably

14

believe that from talking to everybody and the reading I

have done, we can be able to compare that bullet with

QUESTION;

17

The court below proceeded on the

basis

that even if it is very probative and would be

19

necessary, you nevertheless couldn’t get it.

20

MR . GARRETT;

21

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

So we should judge the case on the

22

assumption that the bullet -- that the state really has

23

an interest in getting
