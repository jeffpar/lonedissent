"Sabbath" is used and that it permits an employee whc

means that the statute comes with religious strings

The court said so far as the first part cf
that test is concerned, so far as the purpose portion of

10

the test is concerned,

11

such statute -- and this is the Connecticut court's

12

language -- is to allow those persons who wish to

13

18

The court also said it was unconstitutional

But, in fact, the only issue on

17

constitutionality that was litigated before the

18

Connecticut courts, at both levels, at the trial court

19

and the supreme court, and the only issue of

20

constitutionality that was decided by the Connecticut

21

Supreme Court was not whether the statute is

22

unconstitutional because it is absolute, tut simply

23

whether the statute was unconstitutional because it

24

provided an exemption for religious observers.

And ycu can we cannot affirm cn a

3

MR. LFWIN;

For several reasons.

One,

4

tecause, as I say# we -- ycu -- this Court does not know

5

what the Connecticut court

6

would construe that statute.

7

there's been no opportunity to make a factual record.

-- how the Connecticut court
Second of all, because

We submit that even cn the absolutist

9

argument, this case would have to be reversed tecause

10

this individual was entitled to be exempted on Sundays

11

tecause there was no undue hardship.

12

the Court certainly will not decide, I submit, on a

13

purely abstract and hypothetical basis that a statute

14

which has no exception for undue hardship is

15

unconstitutional as applied to an individual as to whom

16

there would have been no undue hardship if they had

accommodated to him.

MR. LEWIN;

Thank you,

Chief Justice.

up on the question that

18

Justice White was just asking and

19

with Justice O’Conner’s question originally to me.

20

really maybe tie it in

This Court last term in Lynch and Donnelly

21

talked

22

Thanksgiving and Christmas are national holidays which

23

have religious sigrificance , and it noted that it’s

24

clear that the government has long recognized, indeed

25

has subsidiaed, holidays with religious significance by

in the course of its opinion abcut the fact that

giving federal employees off on that day.

2

To take your hypothetical, Justice White, if

3

in fact a legislature said you cannot fire somebody who

4

takes off on Thanksgiving or Christmas for religious

5

reasons, we think that would be obviously an absolute

6

statute that would have religious significance in the

7

sense

8

religious days and indeed were subsidized.

9

that this Court has recognized those were

I think

there's no question it almost follows

10

a fortiori, Justice C Connor, that if the federal

11

government can subsidize those days that this Court has

12

recognized to be religious holidays, that it should

13

certainly be able to say to a private employer you can* t

14

fire somebody.

15

clause

16

the Court specifically said

17

whether the free exercise clause might require some sort

18

of exemption, it is hardly impermissible for Congress --

19

and I submit for a local legislature -- to attempt to

20

accommodate free exercise values in line with our happy

21

tradition of avoiding --

That's the spirit of the free exercise

that this Court talked about in Gillette where

MR. LEWIS:

2

QUESTIONi

-- exactly what this statute dees.
Dc you think the fact that

3

government can susidize a minister tc say prayer at the

4

opening of legislative sessions would authorize the

5

government tc pass a statute saying there must be a

6

minister at the board of directors meeting?

7

MR. IEWIN:

No, Your Honor.

I think that

8

would be -- that would be unconstitutional.

But that's

9

not because -- in terms of legislative prayer, I think

10

the fact is this Court has said there's a historic lasis

11

for it

12

effect cn any taxpayers.

13

in Marsh and Chambers.

That,

There's really a minimal

I submit, would be an extreme case in

14

which an employer is being 3sked to subsidize directly

15

some religious performance.

16

an employer you have to pray on Saturdays, you have to

17

go work cn Sundays, or you have to go tc church cn

18

Sundays, or you have to perform religious observances.

19

It says permit ycur employees tc do it and don't fcrce

20

them to the cruel choice of choosing between their

21

livelihood and divine command.

This statute doesn't say tc

Thank

you.
