MR. QUARLES*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Courts
With the Court's permission I'd like to
reserve five minutes of my allotted time for rebuttal.
In November 1977, seven and one-half years

11

ago, the common stock of Landreth Timber Company,

12

located in Tonasket., Washington was sold pursuant to a

13

stock purchase agreement.

attributes of common stock are securities.

reasonable expectations in

18

1977 are relevant — and this Court has declared that

19

they are in the Forman decision -- then it is

20

appropriate to examine what the state of the law was in

21

1977 when the parties structured their transaction and

22

what has happened to the law since then.

23

In 1977 the federal securities laws had been

24

in place for more than 40 years, and this Court had

25

applied them to a broad variety of transactions,

control in TSC Industries v. Northway.

In 1977 when the parties structured this

transaction, no court cf appeals had published an

opinion holding that common stock would lose its status

as a security if sufficient numbers of those shares were

QUESTION*

Mr. Quarles,

T suppose the form the

5

transaction took was largely guided by tax reasons,

6

wasn't it?

7

MR. QUARLES;

There was no -- as to my clients

8

there was no choice involved.

Mr. landreth, insisted from the outset that the

10

transaction be structured as a sale of securities.

It bears repeating, I think, what the Ninth

21

Circuit's approach doas.

22

upon what the character of the instrument was when it

23

was created, not the method by which it was exchanged.

24

The Ninth Circuit reverses that focus and focuses

completely on the transaction in which it is exchanged

existing contracts which the company had,

In addition to representations concerning the
the

10

liabilities which were to be assumed, representations

11

were made that the company's mill, which had earlier

12

been destroyed by fire, was being reconstructed on

13

schedule, was being reconstructed out of the insurance

14

proceds, that the additional construction costs to the

15

purchasers would be minimal, that it could operate after

16

reconstruction on a two-shift basis, that it would

17

produce as much as twice the industry standard of lumber

18

per log, that it would produce profitable, high grade

19

timber, and that it would produce an acceptable return

20

on the investment, on the capital that was to be

21

invested.

22

The falsity cf those representations resulted

23

in the expenditure of more than $500,000 additional to

25

reconstructing the mill.

instrument may be, must meet the definition of an

2

investment contrast; and that this transaction, even

3

though it involved stock with all of the ordinary

4

characteristics of stock, could not do so.

5

And why couldn't it do so?

According to the

6

district court, the third requirement of the Howey test,

7

a reasonable expectation of profits from the efforts of

8

others, could not be met, the court held, because Mr.

9

Landreth was merely a consultant.

The Ninth Circuit

10

affirmed, holding that the Howey investment contract

11

test must be applied, and that the requirement of an

12

expectation of profits from the efforts of others could

13

not be met.

14

I submit that the analysis of the Ninth

15

Circuit was wrong at every turn.

17

it cannot be applied, I submit, without producing

to come.

Turn next, if you will, to the violence which
the Ninth Circuit's opinion does to the structure of the
1933 and the 1934 acts.

Application of those acts, an

6

transactions, and for their counsel who advise them as

7

they structure those transactions, turns on whether an

but not at other times and not in other people's hands.

This case presents a graphic example of that.

12

the purchase of the next 2 percent net be a security, or

13

does the purchase of the second 2 percent require that

15

questions will burden district courts endlessly.

Those types of

Furthermore, if someone is to attempt to make

17

a distinction between investors and entrepreneurs, a

18

distinction which even the Seventh Circuit who adopted

the distinction recognized to be fuzzy, I submit that it

This uncertainty of application of the

securities laws and the illogical results that it

produces will burden lawyers and parties they advise as

they structure transactions, and it will force district

courts to struggle to determine whether they have

jurisdiction and produce the potentially wasteful result

determination that jurisdiction does not exist.

the test which was proposed by the Ninth Circuit, the

illogical results it produces, and the inability to

20

reconcile the test, which is proposed with the language

21

of the acts, and the structure which Congress employed

when it adopted those acts shows how far adrift this

approach of the Ninth Circuit is from the statute and

from the purposes behind it.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. SMITH, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THF RESPONDENTS
MR. SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

As may be expected, respondents and petitioner

agree on very little, including the definition of the

11

parties in this case.

20

Landreth Timber Company is the successor in interest tc

22

purpose of purchasing 100 percent of the stock of

And second, the record below unequivocally

7

test which the Court announced in SEC v. Howey in 1946.

8
9

T submit that that's incorrect,

This Court

And the test, the test which we say should

There's nothing new about this test, and we
submit that the question before the Court is not whether

10

a new sale of business doctrine test should be adopted,

11

but whether the Court should continue to apply the

12

economic realities test, which it enunciated in Hcwey,

13

which Forman said is the touchstone that underlies all

14

of the Court's decisions regarding a security, which

15

Forman said for our purposes is no different than the

16

definition of a security which has been consistently

17

applied by this Court.

18

Now, I'd like to summarize what respondents*

19

position is in this case.

20

of the acts, and I invite the Court in response to

21

petitioner's point to consider the structure of the acts.

22

The 1933 and

'34 acts say unless the context

23

otherwise requires, and then proceed to identify

24

2

protection, is not even the first instrument listed.

3

The first instrument listed is notes, notes -- notes,

4

something that we have, all have common understanding of

5

what constitutes a note.

6

note by itself is a security under the 1933 act without-

7

the application of additional economic criteria?

But can you decide whether a

8

There’s nothing in the structure of the acts

9

which gives stock any more dignity than any other term

10

under the act, than the term investment contract, then

11

the term notes, than the term debenture, the term

12

bonds.

That's the structure of the act.

13

Why is that preceded by the context clause?

14

Well, petitioner argues in its brief that the contect

15

clause is sort of just another context clause like 40

16

some other federal statutes that say unless the context

17

otherwise requires.

18

The problem with that is this Court, this

19

unanimous Court in Karine Bank in 1982 said the context

20

clause had considerable importance.

for the application of the economic realities test to

22

the very instruments that the Court would have to

consider whether or not it constituted a security.

determine the existence of a security under the 1933 and

determined that the criteria was whether there was an

submit that the Court has in Forman spoken to that and

said in talking about an instrument, admittedly an

atypical instrument that was called stock, that that was

SR. SMITH:

No.

I just wanted to be sure.

I’d like to turn for a minute to

4

the record below, because I think this Court should be

5

quite clear what case it has before it, and I'm not sure

6

it's the case as described by petitioner.

7

This district court -- and T submit when we

8

talk about burdens on courts, this district court acted

9

very effectively and efficiently in analyzing whether or

1

not control passed to this purchaser at closing.

11

told the parties after an evidentiary hearing to

12

exchange admissions to perfect the record, and here is

13

what the petitioner admitted below;

14

stock purchase agreement my clients agreed to sell 1

15

percent of the stock in Landreth Timber to a corporation

16

to be formed by the purchasing group: that they agreed

17

to, my clients, and did resign as officers and directors

18

of LTC-1;" -- that's Landreth Timber Company 1 -- "that

19

none of the respondents became officers, directors,

2

shareholders or employees of the acquiring company or

21

held any interest in it; that none of the selling

22

parties had any right to share in the profits or losses

23

of the successor corporation; that the purchasing group"

24

-- which Mr. Quarles has described as Mr. Sam Dennis and

25

Mr.

It

"That under the

Eolten on the Fast Coast -- "in fact acted prior to

closing ani hire! their own mill manager who they put in

2

place on the date of closing who ran the business; and

3

that Ivan Lanireth was retained under a terminable at

4

will consulting agreement under which he had no real

5

power and was in fact terminated within two months of

6

the date of closing.”

7

We submit those admissions establish rather

8

clearly before this Court that absolute and total

9

control passed to the purchaser at the time of closing.

10

Now, I'i

like to turn to some major principles

11

that I think come out of this Court’s decisions.

12

this Court certainly, despite the suggestion to the

13

contrary, does not write on a clean slate or a blank

14

slate with respect to the propositions urged by

15

petitioner.

16

And

Number one, no case that this Court has

17

decided stands for the proposition asserted by the SEC

18

and the petitioner that so long as an instrument is

19

named in the acts and that it is what it pretends to be

20

-- that is, that it has some traditional characteristics

21

-- that it is a security and that the inquiry ends.

22

In fact, the sole source of that argument is a

23

single sentence in the Joiner decision that this Court

24

rendered in 1943 before its decision in Howey in 1946.

25

And in that case the Court said instruments may be
33

(202) 628-9300

1

included within any of these definitions as a matter of

2

law if on their face they answer to the name or

3

description.

4

Well, the same argument that's been made to

5

this Court today was made to this Court in Forman in

6

1975, and the Court looked at precisely that language

7

and here’s what the Court said about it;

8

conditional words "may" and "might" in these dicta, the

9

Court made clear that it was not establishing an

by using the

10

inflexible rule barring inquiry into the economic

11

realities underlying a transaction.

12

So it’s petitioner that's coming before this

13

Court and urging what essentially is a new rule; that

14

is, for this most protected type of instrument,

15

that a literal characteristics test should be applied.

16

That's never been applied by this Court before.

Quarles would confine to be the investment contract test

OPAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES LINWOOD QUARLES III, ESQ.,

MR. QUARLES:

Thank you, Your Honor.

My brother commenced part of his argument by

asking me if perhaps I could enlighten you as to what I

thought the difference was between a typical instrument

and an atypical instrument.

A typical instrument is precisely what the
Ninth Circuit held this stock to be.

It's an instrument

10

that answers to its name when it’s called? it has all of

11

the common attributes of the instrument as it’s

12

understood by all parties.

13

is when you attempt to make an instrument bear a burden

14

that it can't bear.

15

16

And an atypical instrument

You try to call stock, in Forman

My brother spent a substantial portion of his

requirement of a common enterprise.

19

there are two things that need to be considered.

no dispute to his affidavit -- he would not have gone

Furthermore, the other point that I wished to

speak to briefly was the suggestion that the limited

purpose of this act suggests that this Court should
