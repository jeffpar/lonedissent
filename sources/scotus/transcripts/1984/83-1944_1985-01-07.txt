MS. GALTER;
may it

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

please the Court, this case is here on the State

10

of Nebraska's petition for certiorari to the Eighth

11

Circuit Court of Appeals.

12

Nebraska contends that the lower court erred

13

in mandating an exception solely on religious grounds to

14

Nebraska's requirement that a photograph appear on the

15

respondent's driver's license.

drivers as well as the security of financial

In short, we are asking the Court to clarify

7

the holdings in Thomas versus Review Board and in

8

Sherbert versus Verner to provide a qualitative analysis

9

of the degree of abridgement of religious freedom in

10

terms of its actual interference with an essential

11

practice of religion.

12

We feel this is significant for the reason

13

that the lower court specifically found that there was

14

no coercion of action which is contrary to a free

15

exercise claim.

16

The first question in any free exercise

will,

recognized.

14

potential dangers which we can articulate as a state is

15

that Nebraska has just raised the legal drinking age

from 19 to 21.

and T think there will be a high incentive for young

people tc perhaps fraudulently obtain non photographic

There is also increasing federal pressure on

from that is that she had such a high level of concern

about the situation in which she was placed that she

10

And that is, she had passed the examination.

11

She had qualified under all of the substantive

12

requirements in order to obtain a renewed driver's

license at that time, but she was not able to get a

renewed driver's license because her religious beliefs

15

prevented her from submitting to being photographed.

Do you think that part of the

concern with that motivation,

legitimate concern.

18

through the recent decisions in Thomas and Lee what

19

happens if people -- if we grant exemptions and people

20

are then placed in a situation where they can be

21

exempted from paying the taxes, and I think that is a

legitimate concern.

23

And I think that is a concern that I find very

difficult to see in this particular case.

That might be one.
MB. LANSWORTH:

I think that might be one, and

7

I would agree that she has suggested that,

8

certainly no evidence to suggest that that is a

9

possibility in this case, and there is certainly no

evidence in this case to suggest that Mrs.

That is the way you worked it?

MR. LANSWORTH:

That's correct, but I think

16

there are situations where numbers are not the only

17

situation or the only consideration.

18

For example, the Court's decision in the

19

recent Lee case is one of those where the Court has

indicated in that opinion that it is very concerned with

regard

to any kind of exemption from taxing systems

think that that is a situation in which

it didn’t directly state that,

the facts in the Lee case was similar to what I in fact

19

difficult to see how this was going to impact in any

negative way upon the social security system, but I

think

in that opinion, which was that if you begin to make
