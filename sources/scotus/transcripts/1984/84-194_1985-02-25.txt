Now, the court of appeals attempted to avoid

the straightforward language of Section 2680(h) by

11

pointing out that Respondent's claim is drafted in terms

12

of negligence rather than directly charging the

13

Government with assault and battery.

14

It is undoubtedly true that Respondent, with

15

an eye on Section 2680(h), has framed her complaint here

16

to charge negligence rather than directly charge assault

17

and battery; but we believe that a plaintiff's drafting

18

decision plainly can't control the waiver of sovereign

19

immunity that Congress has placed in the Tort Claims

Act.

It is a crucial —

I mean maybe -MR. GELLER;

I think, the distinction is not

difficult, Justice Stevens, because Section 2680 (h) bars

There’s a

line of cases, however, where one inmate assaults

another inmate, and we have not contended that that

would he covered by Section 7680(h).

4

I think the distinction is one that Justice

5

Harlan when he was a member of the Second Circuit drew,

6

and we think quite reasonably so, in the Panella case;

7

and that is something that has been followed by many of

8

the subsequent courts.

9

QUESTION;

You would read the arising out of

10

language to mean arising out of an assault by a federal

11

employ ee.

12

MR. GELLEE;

7

(202) 628-9300

1

this broader language for a reason.

We think the reason

2

was that it wanted to avoid the federal Treasury's

3

having to pay any claim that requires proof of an

4

intentional tort by a federal employee.

In fact,

5

negligence supervision claims such as the one •'■hat

6

Respondent has tried to bring here would seem to be

7

precisely the sort of claim that arises out of an

8

assault and battery but perhaps does not fall within

9

wording such as for assault and battery.

10

So we think that unless Congress' choice of

11

language -- and it was a deliberate choice of language

12

-- is to be accorded no significance, then Section

13

2680(h) has to be read to cover claims like Respondent's

14

that sound in torts other than assault and battery but

15

plainly arise out of assault and battery.

16

And if there were any real doubt that this was

17

the correct interpretation of the exemptions to the Tort

18

Claims Act, I think it was dispelled by the Court's

19

decision last term in the Kcsak case.

20

Now, the Court will recall that Kosak involved

21

a parallel exception to the Tort Claims Act, Section

22

2680(c).

23

States in respect of the detention of goods by Customs

24

14

the same broad and all-encompassing meaning that words

such as ’’arising out of,” which appear in Section

18

States, in the Court’s words, in any way associated with

19

the detention of goods, including the plaintiff’s claim

20

And the Court said that in respect of has

And therefore, the Court said that

There’s no reason why Section 2680(h) should

23

Court

Therefore, we think in light of the Court's decision in

in Kosak analogized Section 2680(c)

1

Kosak,

Section 2.680 (h) has to bar claims that are in any

2

way associated with an assault and battery by a federal

3

em ploy ee.

4

In fact,

the way that the court of appeals

5

construed Section 2680(h) is really quite perverse,

6

because what the court of appeals essentially said is

7

that the only species of claim that it bars is a claim

8

trying to hold the United States liable on a respondiat

9

superior basis for the intentional torts of its

10

employ ees.

11

But there really was very little reason why

12

Congress should have been concerned when it passed the

13

Tort Claims Act in

14

held liable on a respondiat superior basis for

15

intentional torts,

16

and it's still unusual today, for an employer to be held

17

18

intentional torts of its employees.

12

Congress meant to foreclose suits against the United

13

States under 2680(h).

14

necessarily would extend to suits challenging

15

intentional torts by non-employees such as I discussed

16

with Justice Stevens.

17

However, we don't believe that it

22

reported cases involving intentional torts by employees,

23

it would have seen that most of those suits alleged a

24

negligent supervision theory, and yet, there’s nothing

25

in the language or legislative history of the

If it had locked at the

2

meant to foreclose suits based on the really less likely

3

theory, which is respondiat superior, and allow the

4
5

United

States to be sued on the more likely theory,

which is negligent supervision.

6

And I think that Congress' amendment of the

7

Tort Claims Act, the intentional tort exception, in

8

confirms this common understanding of the clause,

9

because as the Court is aware, Congress amended the Tort

Act in 1974 to allow the United States to be sued

12

And that amendment followed a series of well-publicized

13

episodes in which law enforcement officers,

14

drug agents, had engaged in illegal searches and

15

seizures, no-knock raids, and illegal arrests.

And. yet,

the legislative history of the 1974 amendments are guite

25

no one, that prior to the amendment in

1974 the United

Statas could not have been sued by the victims of those

2

raids because of the intentional tort exception.

3
4

And so I think for all of these reasons, the
Third Circuit was quite wrong to deviate from the plain

5

langua ge of Section 2680(h) in holding that this suit

6

was no t barred by the intentional tort exception.

7

Now, I would like to turn briefly to our Feres

8

a rg um a nt.

9

stated it is inconceivable that Congress could have

We think that for the reasons I have just

10

i n t en d ed to allow a plaintiff to circumvent the

11

all-an compassing language of the intentional tort

12

except ion by the simple expedient of framing a complaint

13

that s ounds negligence by plainly is seeking damages

14

from t he United States based on an intentional tort,

15

Noneth eless, Respondent has done precisely that here,

16

and we think that as a result, her complaint runs

(202) 628-9300

1

soldiers could challenge the decisions of their superior

2

officers in court in the guise of tort claims litigation.

3
4

It's really hard to imagine a case that more
directly implicates the Feres doctrine than this one,

5

and I invite the Court to take a look at the allegations

6

of Respondent's complaint to see precisely what I mean.

7

The crucial allegations are at page 14 of the joint

8

appendix, paragraphs 40 and 41 of the complaint.

9

the Court will see in paragraphs 40 and 41 that

And

10

Respondent here alleges that Private Shearer's superior

11

officers at Fort Bliss were negligent in failure to

12

exert more control over Private Heard, a fellow solider

13

at the base, in failing to remove Private Heard from

14

active duty, in failing to prevent Private Heard from

15

injuring his fellow soldiers on the base, and in failing

16

to warn those soldiers of the special danger that

17

Private Heard presented to them.

18

So what we have here is a tort claims act suit

19

by a soldier that's unabashedly intended to hail his

20

superior officers into court to defend against charges

21

that they were negligent in the way that they controlled

22

or refused to discipline or refused to dismiss from the

23

military some fellow soldier who was at the same base.

24
25

Now, I ask the Court would it -- would a suit
like this require a civilian court to referee disputes

problem which the Court mentioned in Feres in allowing

suits.

The definition of employee in the Act covers the

MR. SELLER;

Well, I think there’s a key --

you ha ve cases like Brown and Brooks in which soldiers
were n ot --

this is not a case like that at all.

Now, there’s one ether point that bears
mentio ning in this regard, and that's this:

when the

7

Third Circuit rejected the Government’s intentional tort

8

a rgume nt, what it said was that the basis of

9

Respon dent’s claim wasn’t the intentional tort by Heard;

10

it was instead -- the basis of Respondent's claim

11

instea d was the actions of Private Shearer's superior

12

of fica rs at Fort Bliss.

13

And yet,

when the Court of Appeals considered

14

the Go vernment’s Feres claim, it quickly switched gears

15

and to tally reanalyzed Respondent's suit, and said in

16

tha t c ontext that what Respondent was challenging was

17

not th e actions of Private Shearer’s superiors but what

18

had ha ppened off base when Heard assaulted Shearer.

19

Now, this is a bit of a shell game, we think;

20

when w e find the pea, the court moved it.

21

that R espondent can't have it both ways.

22

that t he basis of her suit is the negligence by private

Panella and its progeny advocating a per se

intended purpose of the FTCA and contradict, rather than

8

Claims Act reflected in Judge Cardozo's remarks in

Panella, upon which the Government has placed

18

To the extent that the circuit court decision in Panella

19

affirmed the district court holding that a case founded

12

The Government's efforts to distinguish cases

13

like Underwood and Fair where the intervening tort

14

feasor was a government employee on the bases that those

cases involve extension of a special duty of protection

to the intervening tort feasors, in those cases because

17

they have been hospitalized, is not convincing.

As the Jablonski Ninth Circuit court said, it

19

is more significant in these cases that they are based

20

on negligence, not assault and battery.

21

although the Government says that Section 319 of the

be some sort of demarcation.

HE. CANNON;
QUESTION;

Yes.
What about that?

HE. CANNON;
without question.

Oh,

There's nc Feres barrier at all.

QUESTION;

What case would you say supports

your conclusion that they'd clearly
ME. CANNON;

have a case?

As Justice Marshall pointed out

12

in the Stencel case, if the jet aircraft had crashed

13

into a civilian house,

14

that the occupants of that house would have had a viable

FTCA action against the government for their negligence.

there is no question at all but

I take it from that you say

that this fellow was the same as the pilot of that plane

business about crashing into a house is purely a

hypothetical situation proposed by Justice Marshall, so

QUESTION;

Well, what in the history showed

that he was likely to rob a bar?

4

MR. CANNON;

There was nothing in his history

5

that would suggest that he was in fact capable of

6

robbing a bar, but certainly there is plenty in his

7

history to suggest that he was a man of violence.

12

There is no second-guessing of military orders
