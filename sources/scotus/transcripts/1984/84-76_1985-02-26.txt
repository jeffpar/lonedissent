CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Ward, I think you may proceed whenever you

are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. WARD, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

7

MR. WARD:

8
9

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

In May of 1978, Carmen Edward, a Black female,

11

was told that she could not register to vote because she

12

had been convicted of the crime of issuing a worthless check

13

which under state law is one involved moral turpitude.

14

That decision to refuse her her vote was based upon the

15

Constitution of 1901 and Section 182 which allows the

16

disfranchisement of voters for conviction of a crime

17

involving moral turpitude.

18

the list.

19

That specific crime is not on

The statutory offense for which she was committed,

20

issuing a worthless check, did not become a statutory crime

21

until 1971.

22

So, the justification for his disfranchisement

23

would fit under the provision of the constitutional provision

24

of 1901 which allows disfranchisement for those who commit

25

any crime involving moral turpitude.

1

A month later in June of 1978, Mrs. Edwards, along

2

with a while male, Mr. Underwood, filed a complaint in the

3

District Court alleging that Section 182 violated various

4

rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.

5

That complaint was later amended to include five causes

6

of action.

7

of in pre-trial.

8
9

Three of the causes of action were disposed

The case was tried on the cause of action that
specific crimes had been added to Section 182 with the intent

10

to disfranchise blacks and that the statute has had that

11

effect presently.

12
13

QUESTION:

Mr. Ward, do you know, does any other

state, than Alabama disinfranchise any category of non-felons?

14

MR. WARD:

Presently?

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

MR. WARD:

Your Honor, I do not know.

There are

17

non-felons disfranchised for commission of various election

18

offenses which may or may not be a felony.

19

aware of any specific state that allows blanketly at least

20

that.

21

disfranchisement for misdemeanors depending on how the

22

statute is written.

23

misdemeanor as being an infamous crime and the provision

24

of law in that state allowed for that to happen, then I

25

think, yes.

But, I am not

I am sure there are some states that allow

If the state court would define a

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

The District Court held that there was a failure

2

on the part of the Appellees to show that 182 was passed

3

with the intent to disfranchise blacks and also that even

4

if that had been shown there was a permissible motive for

5

Section 182 and, therefore, under Palmer and Michael M.

6

the statute was allowed to stand.

7

On Appeal the court below ruled as a matter of

8

law that intent to disfranchise blacks have been shown by

9

the inclusion of the certain crimes, those crimes being

10

misdemeanors and crimes involving moral turpitude and that

11

the Appellants here have failed to prove that there was

12

a permissible motive.

13

It is the Appellants' contention now before this

14

Court that Section 182 must be viewed and analyzed as it

15

exists now, not as it existed 84 years ago when it was passed.

16

Today the effect of Section 182 is as follows:

17

The only crimes for which one can be disfranchised in our

18

state are ones involving moral turpitude or which are a

19

felony.

20

of a misdemeanor in and of itself.

21

demeanor involving moral turpitude or a felony.

22

on the list which do not involve moral turpitude are no

23

longer good crimes in our state.

24

or decision of this Court, they have been stricken.

25

you are dealing now with a statute which, as it presently

That is

We feel it is --

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Ward —

10

MR. WARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

-- do you concede that the statute

12
13

presently has a discriminatory effect?
MR. WARD:

No, ma'am.

I would be very blind and

14

naive and try to come up and stand before this Court and

15

say that race was not a factor in the enactment of Section

16

182; that race did not play a part in the decisions of those

17

people who were at the constitutional convention of 1901

18

and I won't do that.

19

My point is that the effect of the statute today

20

could be and probably is based on reasons that are legitimate

21

reasons that the state can consider.

22

in treatment is the result of those committing moral turpitude

23

crimes or others or a certain class or group committing

24

more felonies than others, then the answer to your question,

25

Your Honor, is the effect or the numbers would not have

If the difference

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

anything to do with race.
If crimes were selected because there was proof

2
3

that more than one group committed those crimes as opposed

4

to another group, the answer to your question may be different.

5

The point is those crimes now viable all involve moral

6

turiptude and to us the issue is whether the state 84 years

7

later can have in operation a provision of law that dis­

8

franchises felons and moral turpitude offenders regardless

9

of what the punishment is.

10

I believe that analysis is consistent with this

11

Court's decisions in some such cases as Doyle, Arlington,

12

and in Davis.
The important factor there was to look at whether

13
14

there could be a justification for the continued validity

15

of a decision.

16

cases, there is an immediate decision.

17

it was challenged, and the parties knew immediately that

18

that decision would be allowed to continue or would have

19

to stop.

20

In all those cases — In each one of those

A decision was made,

Therefore, the factors that were considered in

21

trying to determine whether that decision was valid or not

22

were all there presently.

23

In this case, there is a difference.

the inexorable problem of the passage of time.

We have
This Act

and here it is 84 years later.

2

of those cases, in the Doyle case, in the Arlington case,

3

or Washington versus Davis that says this Court or any court

4

can't consider the present-day factors or the present-day

5

justifications for something in trying to determine whether

6

the state would have a legitimate or valid motive for the

7

passage of the complained of Act.

8

The Court allows --

9

MR. WARD:

And, I read nothing in any

Mr. Ward, I suppose your opposition

10

could make this same argument.

11

Could they make the same argument with respect to felons

12

as to moral turpitude misdemeanors?

13

MR. WARD:

I am asking you, I guess.

Your Honor, they do not make it.

They

14

say that the state has a right to disfranchise those who

15

commit crimes and are defining crime as a felony.

16

The way I read this Court's opinion in the

17

Richardson case, there is -- the state would have the authority

18

to disfranchise all felons which this statute does.

19

The question becomes, well, does the fact that

20

there was a racial motive involved in its passage, although

21

it applies to all felons, would that make a difference.

22

The way I read Richardson it would not; that the second

23

section of the Fourteenth Amendment allows the states to

24

disfranchise felons — and I am going to

25

if it please the Court, that it is not limited just to

argue

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

in a minute,

1

felons -- but in the Richardson case that the section section

2

of the Fourteenth Amendment could not be -- Excuse me.

3

That the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment could

4

not limit what was affirmatively given to the states by

5

the second.
So, the answer to your question, Your Honor, is

6
7

no, I don't think they could say that.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

Before you get too deeply into your

argument, what is a crime of moral turpitude?

I mean, where

do you look for the definition of that in -MR. WARD:

11

In our state, Your Honor, you look

12

at several places.

The first place you look is to the

13

afforded court decisions.

14

turpitude in our state are the subject of a court opinion

15

and Appellate Court opinion, either the Court of Criminal

16

Appeals or the Supreme Court, or a subject of opinion from

17

the State Attorney General's office.

Most crimes which involve moral

The testimony at trial showed that the registrars,

18
19

in determining whether a crime involved moral turpitude

20

or not, would either consult the Attorney General's opinions,

21

the case law, of if that did not help them, they would seek

22

the advice of the local district attorney or the state's

23

attorney.

24
25

QUESTION:

There is no one statutory frame of

reference such as a list that is -9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. WARD:

1

No, sir, there is not, although there

2

are cases which put out a list, but there is no list within

3

the statute itself.

4

QUESTION:

5

that check offense was a moral turpitude crime?

6
7

MR. WARD:

No, sir, that is agreed upon by every­

QUESTION:

What about drunken driving just out

one .

8
9

Nobody denies that this particular --

of curiosity?

10

MR. WARD:

No, sir.

11

QUESTION:

It is not?

12

MR. WARD:

Would not nor can you lose your right

13

t

to vote for drunken driving.

It is suggested then that if you look at the present

14
15

state of affairs and the present justifications that Section

16

182 would be allowed to operate and should not be stricken

17

down.

18

In saying that I would point out to the Court

19

that it has on other occasions, and I am referring now

20

specifically to the Doyle case, which would involve the

21

case of challenged conduct, First Amendment conduct, asks

22

what is the cause and if the cause is not based on the

23

unconstitutional problem but the cause was based on something

24

else, then the decision should be allowed to stand.

25

And, in Doyle this Court lists some of those things,
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

where a confusion is obtained which is invalid.

Later on

2

it can be cured by an intervening time, so the cause of

3

the confusion therefore is not what it was when it started.

4

Or if an arrest is made and that arrest is bad and a con­

5

fession given, things can occur in the meantime where a

6

second confession would be valid and, therefore, the cause

7

of the confession, therefore, would be not be the initial

8

taint.

9

If it is argued or assumed that there is some

10

taint involved in the initial enactment of Section 182,

11

we say that that taint, if any, has been cured because of,

12

first of all, what the statute now says, and, secondly,

13

because of the interest in the state pursuant to various --

14

to the Tenth Amendment and to the Fourteenth Amendment to

15

conduct their affairs in this area.

16

Perhaps stated another way, if North Dakota today

17

or Wyoming passed a law which said that we will disfranchise

18

those that commit moral turpitude crimes, would that be

19

lawful, would that be within the exercise of the Tenth

20

Amendment power or would it not?

21

The fact that Alabama, the start of Alabama's,

22

the root of Alabama's provision was 84 years ago should

23

not treat that state differently today whereas other states

24

under the same circumstances today could pass it.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Ward, doesn't that argument
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

assume -- this is sort of the same thought Justice Blackmun

2

was asking you about -- that there are other states which

3

would pass a statute like this for a non-racial purpose

4

and I don't know if there are any such states.
MR. WARD:

5

Your Honor, I don't either but that

6

is assuming that the state would not have that right.

7

would feel quite strong in saying that the state would have

8

a right to pass a law, fair on its face, applied in a fair

9

manner that made moral turpitude a difference in whether

10

one would vote; that the Tenth Amendment would give the

11

state that right and the Fourteenth Amendment would.
QUESTION:

12
13

I

Do you think they could do it if they

defined moral turpitude to include all traffic offenses?

14

MR. WARD:

No, sir.

I think --

15

QUESTION:

Why not?

You just think they want

16

to insist on obedience of the law, traffic laws are important

17

too.

18

MR. WARD:

Well, they are --

19

QUESTION:

A lot of people are killed on the high­

MR. WARD:

Well, perhaps if that specific finding

20

ways .

21

22

was made.

23

to the states.

24
25

That, again, is perhaps a decision best left

The point I am making is that should this state
in this case be denuded of the ability to impose restrictions
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

on the franchise.

The way the statute operates today other

2

states would have the right to make those kinds of decisions.

3

I can't predict that if North Dakota did that and if it

4

reached this Court what this Court would do, but it may

5

could and if it could, then I would think that this state,

6

Alabama, would have that same right.

7

Assuming that, and you must that the state has

8

a right to disfranchise those who commit moral turpitude

9

crimes, one wonders where that authority comes from.

It

10

comes first from the Tenth Amendment, that the state has

11

the right and a wide discretion of the rights to set

12

qualifications for voters and to determine who is eligible

13

to vote.

14

As a matter of fact, in the Lassiter case, which

15

was cited by this Court in the Richardson case, it states

16

specifically that previous criminal record is a fact the

17

state may take into account in determining whether someone

18

is qualified to vote.

19

We would submit to the Court that that kind of

20

a previous criminal record which included a conviction of

21

a crime involving a moral turpitude type crime would be

22

a factor that the state could take into account and should

23

be able to take into account pursuant to those powers and

24

duties left to it by the Constitution.

25

If the Court is to say that per se a state does
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

not have the right to disfranchise those who commit moral

2

turpitude crimes without a showing that there is some other

3

violation of the federal Constitution, they would be des­

4

troying in my opinion what the Tenth Amendment says and

5

if the Tenth Amendment allows the states to control these

6

types of matters and they can do so, then the states should

7

be allowed to.

8
9

Secondly, this Court's opinion in the Richardson
case, as is well know, the second section of the Fourteenth

10

Amendment allows the state to disfranchise for participation

11

in rebellion or other crime.

12

that and does not put the penalty provision of the rest

13

of the provision on the state if disfranchisement is based

14

on participation of rebellion or other crime.

It affirmatively sanctions

15

This Court in reviewing the legislative history

16

of Section 2, I feel, was careful to point out that there

17

was little debate on what this section meant, that the interest

18

of everyone was on another provision and that section means

19

what it says, other crime.

20

include the conviction of crimes other than a felony.

Therefore, other crime could

21

I again turn to Lassiter because the Court in

22

discussing the eventual holding of Richardson was cited

23

Lassiter and specifically cited the language from Lassiter

24

that allows the state to take into account in determining

25

qualifications of voters previous criminal record.
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The analysis then is that the Fourteenth Amendment

2

either, one, would allow disfranchisement for other crime

3

and escape the penalties of the first section or that because

4

the Fourteenth Amendment, the second section of the Fourteenth

5

Amendment talks about other crimes, there has been created

6

to the state a special area, a unique area, if you will,

7

in dealing with voting.

8

or other crime in an amendment that was passed to help protect

9

that very right, that is voting, seems to me to suggest

The importance of saying rebellion

10

that there is a special area of protection for the states

11

and if the Court was not to accept that other crime means

12

all crimes of any kind, then I would suggest that it would

13

mean that in judging a statute based on the disfranchisement

14

of crimes other than a felony, a lesser standard, a less

15

strict standard that is used in voting cases on a general

16

basis be used; that a strict scrutiny test not be used,

17

but a rational basis test be used.

18

Now, there are some Appellate Court decision that

19

adopt that view.

20

Court that adopted that view.

I could not find any decision from this

21

We would urge that it would be consistent if the

22

language of Section 2 and the citation to cases which talk

23

about the states being able to decide what the qualifications

24

are for voters and cite a Tenth Amendment case that at least

25

this area, this area of voting has left a little more special
15

(202) 628-9300

1

special impact, a little more uniqueness to the states,

2

a little broader latitude, if you will, in dealing with

3

these problems.

4

of the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply at all, but it

5

would apply on a less level than a strict scrutiny will.

7

That is not to say that the first section

But, there could be a discriminati

with that amendment.
What I am saying is that if the difference in

treatment here is because of a classification involved with

moral turpitude crimes as opposed to race, then the Fifteenth

Therefore, the crimes that have been taken out of its sphere,

MR. WARD:

Well, my analysis is I cannot get up

here and say race did not play a part in it.

QUESTION:

I understand that.

But, in your brief

5

you took a little different position.

wasn't invalid originally because it had an additional purpose

7

to disinfranchise poor whites as well as blacks.

wondering whether you — what is your present position with

14

In your brief you argue it was always con­

I don't know whether you are still arguing

MR. WARD:

I would still have to argue that, but

15

I would have to say that again, because of the passage of

16

time, that argument loses some of its strength.

17

If I may, I would like to reserve -- unless there

18

are questions from the Court -- reserve what time I have

19

left.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Ward, I did have one more question.

21

The Court of Appeals also indicated, I think in a footnote,

22

that the statute was under-inclusive because sometimes

23

that apparently it would be characterized at least by the

24

Court of Appeals as crimes of moral turpitude are not included

25

such as mailing pornography and so forth.

Is that accurate?

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. WARD:

1

No, ma'am, it is not accurate for two

2

reasons, Your Honor.

First of all, that mailing by —

3

I can't remember, whatever it is, was not even a crime then.

4

It became a crime in 1967.
Secondly, the argument goes we weren't trying

5

6

to disfranchise all misdemeanors.

We are just trying to

7

disfranchise felons and moral turpitude offenders, misdemeanor^

8

or not.

9

So, the under-inclusive argument, to me, does

10

not apply and misunderstands what we are trying to say.

11

We aren't trying to say that the state can select 18 misdemean

12

and not select 18 others.

13

were more serious than the ones that they did not.

14

And, the 18 they did not select

What we are saying is the threshold question is

15

conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude

16

and then it is that, the moral part of it which is important,

17

not if the penalty is one day or ten days.

18

And, I think that analysis for that reason —

19

the felonies -- if you were to say a statute that disqualifies

20

all felonies, there are some of those which is some states

21

are not serious at all and in some states, of course, are.

22

I think some states, if you pick some wool or something,

23

you can be sent off as a felon.

24

all felons, that same argument could apply there, that some

25

felons -- or crimes which are felons are just so unserious

So, the fact that it is

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

as compared to others it is an under-inclusiveness type

2

thing there.

3

QUESTION:

Could I ask you one other question.

4

You suggest that we should look at the law at it presently

5

stands and that the past is largely irrelevant.

6

the finding or the statement, observation of the Court of

7

Appeals, that this discriminatory effect persists today?

8
9
10

MR. WARD:

What about

Well, sir, that was based on a finding

which was challenged at trial.

That finding was based

on statistics —

11

QUESTION:

Well, what if I accept it though?

12

MR. WARD:

Sir?

13

QUESTION:

What if that observation of the Court

14

of Appeals is to be accepted?

15

MR. WARD:

That —

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

That the law which was passed was a

17

discriminatory intent, had a discriminatory effect and that

18

it still does? What if we accept that?

19

your argument?

20

MR. WARD:

What happens to

Well, if you accept that, if it still

21

does have that effect, then I would suggest that there could

22

be shown that there are reasons other than the selection

23

of the crime that causes the effect.

24

QUESTION:

25

That is a different argument.

Well, that is a different argument.
I thought your argument had

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

been that as of today this statute should be accepted as

2

having a neutral non-discriminatory purpose and impact.

3

MR. WARD:

Purpose.

4

QUESTION:

You said if North Dakota or Wyoming

5

or some states who were not involved in those days passed

6

this same statute now, you think it would be sustained.

7

MR. WARD:

Yes, sir.

8

QUESTION:

Well, you think Alabama may continue

9

it if it has a discriminatory impact today?

10

MR. WARD:

Your Honor, if it was passed again

11

in the same manner, if this Court strikes it down and it

12

is passed again in the same manner and it shows it still

13

impacts against blacks, then proof would have to be adduced

14

as to why and I think some things could be shown as to perhaps

15

why.

But, that —

16

QUESTION:

Well, should we judge the case on the

17

basis that this observation of the Court of Appeals is correct'’

18

Is it supported by the record?

19

MR. WARD:

I don't believe it is, no, sir.

20

QUESTION:

You don't believe it is, but —

21

MR. WARD:

If the state would have the right to

22

disfranchise those who commit crimes involving moral turpitude

23

and that is the reason why there is an impact, then, yes,

24

you could.

25

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILSON EDWARD STILL, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

Mr. Still?

MR. STILL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

6

When John Knox opened the 1901 Constitutional

7

Convention, he stated its purpose very clearly.

8

and what is it we want to do while it is within the limits

9

imposed by the federal Constitution to establish white supremai

He said,

10

in this state.

11

white supremacy by law rather than by force and violence.

12

He went on to say that they wanted to establish

Historians, including the two who testified in

13

this case, one for the Plaintiffs and one for the Defendant,

14

are unanimous that the 1901 Alabama Constitution succeeded

15

in meeting this goal of establishing white supremacy

16

law.

17

by

The Appellants' brief even said that the entire

18

Suffrage Article had the intention to disfranchise poor

19

whites as well as blacks.

20

Suffrage was one of the principal issues of the

21

1901 Constitutional Convention.

22

up, the debate centered on the relative effects of a particu

23

provision on blacks and whites or among different groups

24

of whites.

25

All of the delegates were white by the way.

Every time the issue came

There were no delegates at that convention.

the disfranchisement of blacks and how far to take the

Instead, the debate was over how far to take

6

Now --

7

QUESTION:

Mr.

Still, do you think that the state

8

is forever bound by that original discriminatory purpose

9

or can the passage of time and circumstances ultimately

10

change that?

11

MR.

STILL:

I believe they are bound.

In this

12

Court's decision in City of Richmond versus the United States

13

just two years ago the Court said an official action taken

14

for the purposes of discriminating against Negros on account

15

of their race has no legitimacy at all under our Constitution.

16

And, in the Arlington Heights case, the Court

17

said that racial discrimination is not just another competing

18

consideration.

19

should be the judicial deference that goes along with state

20

laws evaporates.

When you find racial discrimination, that

would probably have to be rewritten, but I think we would

have to -24

QUESTION:

2

MR. STILL:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. STILL:

Your answer is yes -No.
-- that it is also invalid?
No, because the 1875 Constitution

5

disfranchised the felons, so we would have to compare it

6

against what they had before and go back to the provision

7

that they had previously which would disfranchise felons

8

only and not misdemeanors.

9

QUESTION:

Suppose, Mr. Still, that the 1901

10

attitudes were a continuation of the Jefferson point of

11

view that only the property class should vote.

12

not a matter of history?

13

MR. STILL:

Is that

I believe that was Jefferson's view.

14

But, the 1901 Constitutional Convention had, of course,

15

many view points in it but they were primarily interested

16

in disfranchising blacks.

17

had agreed to have the Constitutional Convention on a pledge

18

that they would disfranchise blacks and not whites and they

19

were elected to the Convention on that basis.

20

QUESTION:

In fact, the Democratic Party

The provision with respect to whites

21

in the 1901 Constitution would violate -- Do you think it

22

would violate the Fourteenth Amendment even if it didn't

23

violate the Fifteenth?

24
25

MR. STILL:

Some of the provisions of the 1901

Constitution as applied to whites have been struck and as
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

applied to all people.

For instance, the poll tax was struck

2

down in Alabama in 1966 in U.S. versus Alabama.
So, there are many provisions of this Constitution

that have been struck down on general equal protection,

5

non-racial grounds over the years.

test than just whatever the test is of this passage which

is certainly a permissible point of view.
MR. STILL:

I would suggest that.

I would suggest

that the tests that have been enunciated in Arlington Heights

by the majority of this Court and that this would be proven

of a pretty transparent law.

for discrimination.

11

Mr. Ward and the Appellants have claimed that

the affirmative sanction of Section 2 of the Fourteenth

Amendment allows them to disfranchise on the basis of

misdemeanors of moral turpitude.

4

There are some interesting anomolies in Alabama's

5

decisions about what is a crime of moral turpitude.

6

instance, selling untaxed, illegal liquor is not a crime

7

of moral turpitude but selling narcotics is a crime of moral

8

turpitude in Alabama.

For

And, as I said, driving while intoxicated may

10

become a crime of moral turpitude in Alabama some time

11

soon.

12

But, the affirmative sanction of Section 2 of

13

the Fourteenth Amendment that the Appellants rely on, as

14

I say, does not allow a state to pick and choose among those

15

crimes and say, well, we are going to disfranchise some

16

people within this category and not others.

Amendment cannot provide a shield to the State of Alabama

18

any more than the Twenty-First Amendment can provide a shield

That is one of the issues that they have

I believe that it may assist the Court in making --

QUESTION:

11

MR. STILL:

As another ground for affirmance?
Yes, as another ground for affirmance.

12

But, I also believe that if this Court remanded to the Court

13

of Appeals, they would then have to decide that particular

14

issue.

15

Now, the Court of Appeals also analyzed the state's

16

reasons for adopting Section 182, the reasons they proffered.

17

They found that those reasons were not supported in the

18

record as being reasons that had actually been considered

19

at the 1901 Convention and they also found them to be

20

insufficient as a matter of law.

21

Now, the state said we have got a right to

22

disfranchise people who were convicted of crimes of moral

23

turpitude or any type of crime that we want to use and they

24

cite the case of Washington versus State which was decided

25

about a decade and a half before the Constitutional

then also because of this picking and choosing feature the

7

Court held that the state was not using the best means avail­

They were unable to show the Court of Appeals

And

For instance, in Alabama it is not a crime of

moral turpitude to assault a police officer.

11

a crime of moral turpitude to be convicted of second degree

12

manslaughter.

Each one of those is a relatively serious

offense that

is going to get you a lengthy jail term but

14

still a misdemeanor, much more than you can get for passing

15

a bad check for which you can get no jail time at all and

yet neither one of those offenses is an offense that will

disfranchise one.

of that that the state's argument about picking and choosing

of violating the state's laws was not legally valid.

it also had some effect on whites as well as on blacks.
