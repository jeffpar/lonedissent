ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT G. LAUBER, JR., ESQ.

ON EEHAIF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LAUBER;

7

Chief Justice,

may it please

the Court;
This case presents a question about the

addition to the tax often referred to colloquially as a

10

penalty for failure to file a tax return on time.

11

Section 6651(a)-1 of the Internal Revenue Cede provides

12

that in case of failure to file any return on the date

13

prescribed therefor, there shall be added to the tax an

14

amount up to a total of 25 percent of the total tax due

15

unless it is shown that such failure is due to

16

reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.
The question here is whether a taxpayer can

17
18

demonstrate reasonable cause for a late filed return

19

even though that return’s late filing is in fact

20

attributable to negligent by citing the fact that he

21

relied

on his attorney or ether agent to prepare the

estate tax return.

21

a due date.

carelessness, forgot all about the return until well

£s a result, the
The Commissioner

1

determined that the executor's late filing was not due

2

to reasonable cause, and accordingly, asserted an

3

addition to the estate tax in the appropriate amount.
The Court of Appeals expunged the penalty.

4

It

5

recognized that under longstanding Treasury regulations,

6

the determination of reasonable cause is governed by an

7

objective test, that is, whether the taxpayer exercised

8

ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless

9

unable to file the return within the prescribed time.

10

But the Court of Appeals held that here the executor's

11

late filing was due to reasonable cause.
It relied primarily on two facts, the fact

12
13

that the executor lacked personal knowledge of the

14

filing date, and that he relied on his attorney to

IS

prepare the return for him.

16

acknowledged that three other circuits had ruled as a

matter of law that reliance on counsel standing alone is

common sense.

23

here,

filed,

25

to file that return on time.

We start from the premise that where, as

it is clear that a tax return is required to be
the taxpayer has a personal and nondelegable duty
This premise we think

5

1

follows from a variety cf cede provisions that state

2

that the taxpayer shall make a return, he shall sign the

3

return under penalties of perjury, and that he shall

4

file it ty a specified date.
The personal and nondelegable nature of his

5
6

timely filing obligation has been recognized by almost

7

every lower federal court to address the question, and

8

we think from this premise two conclusions inevitably

9

follow .
First of all, because the taxpayer's duty to

10
11

file on time is personal, he has a concomitant duty

12

personally to find out what the filing date is, and that

13

we think is just a matter of common sense.

14

knows he has a duty to perform and knows it must be

15

performed by a deadline, ordinary business care and

16

prudence require him, plainly require him tc find cut

17

what that date is.

19

Lauber, if you know whether — what is the policy of

20

IRS?

21

Do they dispense mercy very efter in this area?
ME. LAUBER;

Well, we -- the IRS tries tc be

22

reasonable, but I don't think they would be inclined to

23

be particularly clement in a case like this, and

24

try and explain why it would be --

25

QUESTION;

Well,

I will

I don't mean as to this

6

1

case
Are there many dispensations granted in a

2
3

given year/ if you know?
Do they forgive late filings with very many

4
5

people ?
ME. LAUBER:

6
7

8

that,

I really don't know the answer to

to that question.
And secondly, because the taxpayer's duty to

9

file on time is nondelegable, he cannot escape liability

10

for a late filing simply by having somebody else prepare

11

the return for him; rather, if the taxpayer is going to

12

show ordinary business care and prudence, he has got to

13

supervise his agent and make sure the agent gets about

14

the business of preparing the return.

15

Moreover, if the agent is negligent himself,

16

that negligence, we think, under agency doctrine, must

17

be imputed to the taxpayer as the principal.

18

And we think if the Court agrees with us about

19

these general rules in the area, reversal of the Court

20

of Appeals decision is required.

21

knew that he had to file a return; he knew he had tc

22

file it by a certain date; but he simply failed tc find

23

out what that date was.

of care that an ordinarily prudent businessman whc faced

25

a liability would use in making sure that his agent was

Here, the executor

He also failed to use the kind

7

1

prompt in preparing the return.
I think in both those respects the taxpayer

2
3

was negligent.
Moreover, the attorney was plainly negligent

4
5

because he forget about the return altogether, and that

6

negligence must be imputed to the taxpayer.

7

both of them were negligent, we think that there was no

8

reasonable cause and the penalty was properly assessed.

And since

This result, we think, is not only dictated by

9
10

well-settled tax principles, but makes perfect sense.

11

And here it is helpful to recall the words of the

12

statute.

13

addition to the tax shall be imposed unless it is shewn

14

that the failure to file was due to reasonable cause.

It says that where a return is filed late, an

Well, the regulations set out —
I mean apart from the regulations.
And the prior -There must be some explanatory

material about the regulations themselves.
MR. LAUBER;

2

Well, the only thing I know of is

3

the Internal Revenue manual lists eight examples of

4

cases where the penalty will not be assessed, and they

5

are listed in a footnote in cur brief.

6

any other secret law on the subject.

I don’t knew of

But the IRS would not assess the penalty if it

7

8

looks like there is a reasonable basis for a late

9

filing, and it is only when there is no reasonable basis

10

that they will go after the taxpayer.
But I think if you look at all the acts and

11
12

omissions that actually caused the late filing here, it

13

could not be shown that that late filing had a

14

reasonable cause.

IS

was failure of oversight by the executor and

16

carelessness by the lawyer.

17

the taxpayer, had committed all those acts and beer

18

guilty of all those omissions, he couldn’t possibly

19

escape the late filing penalty.

Indeed, the cause of the late filing

MR. LAUBER;

Here, the Court of Appeals did reach their

Now, we of

But we think those conditions are not present

Would you agree that generally

speaking these heavy penalties don't fall cn people who

MR. IAUBER;

19

Well, they generally don't

20

because the penalty is one quarter, maximum, one quarter

of the tax due.

speaking, there is no penalty in the estate tax area at

least.

Even though the executor or trustee

MB. LAUBER:

the penalty is

It is 5 percent per month for

every month up to 25 percent that the return is late.
Eut I think what the case boils down tc is a

7

fairly, as Justice Marshall said, a fairly common sense

8

preposition.

9

that the IRS cannot collect from the taxpayer because he

Here,

«hat the Court cf Appeals held is

10

relies on the agent.

11

because the agent, not being a taxpayer, can’t be liable

12

for the addition to the tax, and the result is the IRS

13

can collect from no one, even though it is plain in that

14

precisely what Congress spoke of in the penalty

15

provision, a filing not due to reasonable cause, it is

16

late, has happened.

17

It can’t collect from the agent

And we think this outcome just makes no sense,

18

as a matter of statutory construction or tax policy or

19

common sense or even fairness to the parties involved.

20

Congress designed the late filing addition tc the tax as

21

an incentive to timely payment of taxes.

22

to protect the revenue.

23

It is designed

Now, the effect of this incentive will be

24

destroyed if a taxpayer can escape liability for a

25

negligent late filing merely by having somebody else

16

1

prepare his return.

2

kind of holding is clear because literally tens cf

3

millions of American citizens hew have income tax

4

returns prepared by professional return preparers.

5

Indeed, the harmful effect cf that

We think the sensible approach in this kind of

6

situation where the negligence is somehow shared in an

7

unclear way between the taxpayer and his agent, is tc

8

let the IRS collect the penalty that it is entitled to

9

collect under the statute, let the taxpayer and his

10

agent sort out among themselves who will bear the ccst

11

of the penalty.

He dissented in the earlier Seventh

Circuit case.
MR. LAUBERi

I think they are quite similar

because Judge Posner -QUESTIONi

school, you know.
MR. LAUBER:

3

is — have tc pay up, he would surely have a claim

against the lawyer -QUESTIONS

5
6

Well, Judge Posner would have

reserved a situation for that person, I suggest.
HR. LAUBERs

7

Eut I think his reservation

8

doesn't fit with his basic theory that if it is true

9

that the peer, wronged taxpayer has an action over, or

10

for reimbursement against a lawyer, why make an

11

exception that only operates tc hurt the IRS when it is

12

clearly entitled tc a penalty because the return has in

13

fact been filed late and negligently.
And as long as a taxpayer is made whole fer

14
15

whatever errors his agent committed, the taxpayer is not

16

going to be out any money, and the IRS will get what

17

Congress wished it to get when taxes,

18

late.

19

returns are filed

And what we think really makes no sense at all

20

is to deprive the IRS of the penalty, let the taxpayer

21

in effect borrow mcney from the government at will and

22

let the negligent lawyer get off completely free.

23

I would like to address briefly the —

I would like to address briefly the analysis

7
8

of a statute that the Respondent has put forward in his

9

brief.

Respondent nowhere argues that the executor's

10

conduct here amounted to ordinary business care and

11

prudence within the meaning of the regulations.

12

contends for the first time in this Court that the

13

regulation is invalid and that the penalty should be

14

imposed only where the taxpayer is guilty of willful

15

conduct.

16

He

And that interpretation we think simply won’t

17

wash under the terms of the statute Congress drafted.

18

The statute says that the penalty is collectable unless

19

it is shown that the failure to file on time is due to

20

reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.

21

Since the burden of proof is on the taxpayer,

22

and since the terms reasonable cause and willful neglect

23

are used conjunctively, the Commissioner has an option

24

of proving either the absence of reasonable cause or the

25

presence of willful neglect.

He can prove either one.

20

1

Hew, cf course, the practice, because the

2

absence of reasonable cause is basically negligence, it

3

is easier to prove that than to prove willful activity

4

with the subjective content.

5

option is easier than the other for the Commissioner

6

doesn’t mean that cne is redundant.

I

Yes,

sir.

think it's necessary to look at the statute

20

in question, and that is really the key, in my opinion,

21

of how this should be decided.

22

Congress did not provide for an absolute

23

penalty that could be invoked in all circumstances.

24

would certainly agree that that is certainly their

25

prerogative.

I

But I am suggesting to this Court by the

30

1

insertion of the words reasonable cause and not due to

2

willful neglect, suggests that Congress recognizes --

3

recognized that it may in fact be inequitable or unfair

4

under certain circumstances to unilaterally provide for

5

an absolute penalty or absolute rule.
Now, that is certainly within their

6
7

prerogative to do that, but I'm suggesting that they

8

have not chosen to do that.

9

that the addition of the words willful neglect would

As Judge Fosner indicated,

10

seem to modify the ordinary meaning of the word

11

reasonable.

12

means is that Congress, by using the words willful and

13

neglect, intended that the

MR. DAVIES:

MR. DAVIES.:

QUESTIONS

5

MR. DAVIES;

6

QUESTION;

Yes.
Yes, okay.
On that argument.
What amount cf -- what's the rate

7

of interest on the delinquent payment, not the penalty,

8

the rate of interest.

9

MR. DAVIES;

10

At this time it was 6 percent.

Now, I believe that's raised to a floating rate now.
QUESTION;

11

So the government pays about 11

12

percent to borrow money, and they are only charging, if

13

you're correct, they would only be charging 6 pecent.

14

MR. DAVIES;

At this time.

15

Now, I think that — I believe that’s foolish.

16

Your Honor, and I think they've changed it, but that's

17

not our fault.

18

by charging an appropriate rate cf interest.

I believe there can be proper incentives

QUESTION;

19

Well, didn't -- isn't it possible

20

that Congress put this penalty that you regard as sc

21

drastic in order tc keep the interest at a more moderate

22

rate?

23

MR. DAVIES;

It's possible.

I don't know the

24

legislative history on that.

I believe they have raised

25

the 6 percent, like if you file your income tax return

45

1

late or you don’t pay the money, I should say, you would

this particular time it was 6 percent.

to penalize that person?

I suggest that Congress did net and they

10

allowed a narrow exception which the courts have made in

ORAL ARGUMENT OR ALBERT G. LAU3ER, JR., ESQ.

17

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

19

MR. LAUBERs

I have two points.

20

First, on the question of mootness, the case

21

is definitely not moot.

what happened here is the

22

estate paid the penalty and filed a suit for a refund,

23

for $17,COC, about.

And the arrangements that the estate and the

1

2

lawyer made among themselves on how they divvy up the

3

money is simply not relevant tc this Court’s

4

jur isdiction.

5

New, on the question of statutory

6

construction, I should point out that since 1916 there

7

have been literally thousands of cases construing the

8

late filing addition tc the tax decided by the federal

9

courts.

No court has ever adopted or even suggested the

10

interpretation that Respondent advocates here, i.e.,

11

that only willful neglect causes the penalty to be

12

assessed.

13

terms of whether or not there was reasonable cause.

14

They have uniformly addressed the question in

The regulation that implements what we think

15

is the correct scheme cf the statute has been in effect

16

17

18

19

to have approved it.

COESTICN;

Kell,

do you, assuming that tke

21

regulation is valid, as you say, do you think the Court

22

of Appeals did not proceed on an objective basis?

23

HR. LAUBER:

I think they did not because they

focused on whether or not this particular executor

25

actually knew himself the due date, and whether or net

he had particular executor
QUESTIONi

The question

Ycu don’t think they concluded that

he acted reasonably?
MR. LAUBERi

Well, they thought -- they locked

5

whether he acted reasonably given his particular past

6

experience.

7

reasonable man would have remained ignorant of the

8

filing date.

9

For us the question is whether or net a

QUESTION:

All right.

Assuming, assuming that

10

you are right and that the Court of Appeals applied the

11

wrong standard, shouldn’t we remand?

12

MR. LAUBERi

I think there’s no need for a

13

remand because the Court of Appeals acknowledged that

14

negligence was committed.

15

QUESTIONi

Well, it requires an assessment of

16

the facts under a reasonable man standard which ycu say

17

they didn’t apply.

18

MR. LAUBER:

Well, they acted like they

19

applied it, but because they erroneously employed the

20

reliance on counsel defense, which was not available as

21

a matter of law, if the statute is correctly construed,

22

that was what led them to their incorrect result, and

23

that was a legal error, not a factual error.

24

Finally, I would like to point out that if the

25

Court were to construe the statute as making the penalty

48

1

applicable only where there is willful neglect, it would

2

be an impossible enforcement burden on the government.

3

Thousands of returns are filed late every year, and if

4

we had

5

the taxpayer or his agent acted willfully, it would be a

6

nightmare for the courts and for the IPS.

7

10

to prove on a case by case basis whether or net

It's much better from an enforcement
standpoint as well as being correct under the statute.
QUESTION:
MR. LAUBERi

In other words, a bright line.
A bright line test.

And

what the

11

Revenue Service has done in implementing the reasonable

12

man standard is to define a number of categories of

13

cases which per se will be reasonable cause, and as I

14

mentioned to you before, the manual, the revenue manual,

15

lists eight different categories of cases, for example,

16

where there's an unavoidable postal delay, where there

17

is a death or serious illness of the taxpayer or a

18

member cf his family, where the taxpayer is unavoidably

19

absent from the country, where

20

taxpayer erroneous legal advice, where there’s a

21

destruction or a casualty to the taxpayer and his

22

oroperty, all those situations amount to per se

23

reasonable cause, and that let's the government dispese

24

of many of these cases without litigation.
