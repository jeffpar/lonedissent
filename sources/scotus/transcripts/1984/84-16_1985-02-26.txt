ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS M. EAGAN, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR. EAGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on appeal from the decision

10

of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

11

court held invalid a leasing regulation of the California

12

State Lands Commission.

The lower

13

That regulation authorized the negotiation of

14

rent for leases of state property based upon the volume

15

of commodities crossing the leased land.

16

did not prescribe rates.

The regulation

17

The lower court concluded that such a form of

18

rent, regardless of amount, constitutes an unreasonable

19

burden on commerce.

20

of rent constituted a tariff when used with regard to lessees

21

engaged in interstate or foreign commerce.

22

It further concluded that such a form

And, finally the Ninth Circuit held that the

23

Commission was limited in recovering on its ground leases

24

not a return on its ground leases but only a recovery of

25

the cost, its out-of-pocket costs, when charging rent.

This is a remarkable decision.

1

The decision accords

2

second class status to the state as a lessor.

3

that the state in many instances will be constrained to

4

take less in the way of rent than would another lessor in

5

similar circumstances.

6

QUESTION:

It means

Do you think the result would have

7

been the same under the reasoning of the Court of Appeals

8

if the measurement had not been related to traveling over

9

California territory but simply a percentage of the volume

10

of material taken out?

11

MR. EAGAN:

Well, of course, Your Honor, this

12

is one fact that we would like to drive home to the maximum

13

extent possible.

14

entry of goods into the political jurisdiction of California.

15

It is tied explicitly only to those parcels of property

16

limited in number which are made -- privately appropriated

17

by the lessees to their own use for commercial gain.

18

The charge is not made merely for the

I really don't know what type of rent the Ninth

19

Circuit would have considered permissible other than a non­

20

variable, flat annual rent such as the Commission also

21

charges.

22

There is a final line tossed off in the opinion

23

concerning this is not to say that all forms of volumetric

24

rent are forbidden, but there is really no analytical clue

25

in the decision of the Ninth Circuit concerning what type
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of variable rent it would have found permissible.
It seems to me the thrust of the Ninth Circuit's

2
3

decision is that any form of variable rent, at least with

4

regard to the state and when it deals with interstate or

5

foreign lessees, any such variable rent is prohibited

6

to them.

QUESTION:

calculated on the basis of volume of oil in transit?
MR. EAGAN:

QUESTION:

12

MR. EAGAN:

14

Well, another point, Your Honor, it

is not limited to oil.

11

13

May I ask, Mr. Eagan, is the rent

That is one commodity.

Or whatever goods.
In this case, given the Plaintiffs,

we are talking about oil and petroleum products.
Let me just tell you what the facts are.

I don't

15

know quite the direction Your Honor is taking with the questio

16

The goods —

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Well, you didn't expressly mention

the export/import clause, did you?
MR. EAGAN:

Yes, I did, Your Honor.

That was

20

the second aspect of the Ninth Circuit's holding, that

21

apart from the problems it found --

22

QUESTION:

Well, the considerations would be dif­

23

ferent whether that clause was violated from the consideration

24

of if the commerce clause is violated.

25

MR. EAGAN:

Well, certainly the import/export
5

1

clause is different.

2

don't see there is any application in this case because

3

it does deal with taxes and this Court in Michelin versus

4

Wages, for instance, that even with regard to taxes the

5

question there is what type of taxes?

6

the privilege of entry or is it tied to some service the

7

government provides?

8
9
10

11

In fact, it is so different that we

Is it merely for

We submit it is an a fortiori case, if you will,
when you are talking not about a tax at all but a form of
rental.
What the decision in effect calls for is a subsidy,

12

a subsidy to these oil companies.

13

unfair to the other lessees of the Commission because what

14

this ruling of the Ninth Circuit means is that certain

15

lessees, among them these oil companies, are entitled to

16

special treatment and these other lessees, the lessees of

17

the state that are engaged in intrastate commerce, yes,

18

they may be asked to pay a variable rent, whereas this special

19

class, they cannot be asked to pay such a rent.

20

QUESTION:

The decision is also

Mr. Eagan, would the situation be any

21

different if the State of California either owned or

22

controlled every parcel of land through which the products

23

could enter to go to the refineries?

24
25

MR. EAGAN:

If, indeed, there was a monopoly.

Of course, we think it is very clear there is no such monopoly,
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

but if there were a monopoly, I think the only bearing that

2

might have on the arguments made by the state in this case

3

it might preclude assertion of the market participant

4

doctrine.

5

you have got to have competitors in order to avail yourself

6

of a doctrine.

7

Cases of this Court are not all that clear that

But, that would get us then into the question

8

of reasonableness.

Certainly the state is entitled to charge

9

rent, no question.

The oil companies concede that.

10

And,

if you concede that --

11

QUESTION:

What percentage of this product annually

12

coming into California passes through sources other than

13

state land or does the record tell us?

14

MR. EAGAN:

Well, it is not in the record, Your

15

Honor.

16

majority of petroleum and petroleum products either coming

17

into California or going out of California does not pass

18

over state lands.

19

of petroleum and petroleum products is Long Beach and this

20

is revealed in our cite to the Corps of Engineers' Waterborne

21

Commerce Study.

22

I do have some figures, but I can say this, the

QUESTION:

I think the largest single port in terms

Mr. Eagan, can I ask kind of a basic

23

question here which is whether we should look at this as

24

a tax case or property private rental case?

25

that if it were a tax case and yet a tax formula just like

Would you agree

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

this for entry into the state that it would fall or would

2

you defend it any way?
MR. EAGAN:

3

Not at all, Your Honor.

Of course,

4

it is not a tax, but if it were it seems to me that would

5

lead this Court into application of some of the formulas

6

for evaluating taxes that it has come up with, both in the

7

interstate commerce field and the foreign tax field.

8

am thinking of complete Auto Transit versus Brady, Michelin

9

versus Wages, and the import of those cases is that inter­

10

I

state commerce must pay its own way.
QUESTION:

11

But here it pays a lot more than its

12

own way, doesn't it?

13

MR. EAGAN:

Not at all, Your Honor.

The problem

14

is — That is the diversionary issue if you will that the

15

oil companies have consistently tried to introduced into

16

this case.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. EAGAN:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. EAGAN:

Yes, and the Court of Appeals.
Excuse me?
And the Court of Appeals.
Well, the Court of Appeals realized

21

that really the issue was the form or mode of rent rather

22

than amounts.

23

was not so much the initial lease where at time one there

24

is no lease at all and the question is should the oil company

25

enter into the lease based on volumetric rental.

But, what seemed to bother the Court of Appeals

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

That

1

situation, at least in terms of what the Court said, didn't

2

seem to bother it.

3

context where you have a refinery -- and there are some

4

of them with internal leases that do involve this situation --

5

a refinery on the upland, hard by the wharf site that is

6

leased from the state.

7

What it focused on was this renewal

And, what the Court seemed to be concerned about

8

was a perceived potential for the state demanding and getting

9

extortionate rents.

Now, I think there are some ready answers

10

to that concern of the Ninth Circuit, but we don't think

11

analysis under the commerce clause provides answers to those

12

questions.

13

First, if indeed there is a potential for

14

extortionate rents, that concern, it seems to us, applies

15

regardless of the form of rent that you are talking about.

16

It applies as well that type of concern with a flat annual

17

rent based on a stated percentage of fee value.

18

the stated percentage proposed by the state is 90 percent?

19

The oil companies certainly would be taking issue with that

20

kind of proposal.

21

What if

So, it is not really the mode of rent, it is the

22

amount, regardless of mode, that could present a problem

23

in those situations.

24

Secondly --

25

QUESTION:

In your view, does the Constitution
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

oppose any limit on the amount you can charge even if you

2

regard this rent?

3

MR. EAGAN:

If the market participant clause is

4

indeed applicable, Your Honor, no, the Constitution does

5

not provide any limits.

6

either.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. EAGAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

And, this is not an amounts case

Either form or amount?
Excuse me?
It would not pose any limit as to either

form or amount, method of computation or amount.

11

MR. EAGAN:

12

QUESTION:

If you went on market participant.

13

QUESTION:

Why do you have to win on market

That is correct.

14

participant theory so to speak?

15

proposition entitled to rent the same way a private landlord

16

is unless there is some commerce clause implication or unless

17

there is some export/import clause?

18

clause argument of your opponent is defeated by the market

19

participant argument?

20

MR. EAGAN:

Isn't the state as a general

And you say the commerce

There are a number of alternative

21

responses to it, Your Honor.

22

in the market.

23

which had been the traditional concerns of the commerce

24

clause, not a proprietary activity of the state, and, there­

25

fore, we argue the market participant line of cases of this

One is we are a participant

We are not taxing, we are not regulating,

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Court takes us out from under any application of the commerce

2

clause.

3

in this lawsuit.

4

But, we don't have to win on that point to prevail

If we concede for whatever reason the market

5

participant clause isn't applicable, we are nonetheless

6

entitled to charge rent.

7

fold question, is there some type of monitoring function

8

that this Court has with regard to either modes or amounts

9

and if there is what should the test be?

10

QUESTION:

The question then becomes a two­

Well, of course, what if the State

11

of California owned all of the — owned a half-mile strip

12

all the way around the coastline and all the way around

13

the eastern border of state and northern border and southern

14

border and said, you know, everybody that is bringing any

15

goods in here, we are going to have to charge them a little

16

rent to cross this land?

17

perhaps some commerce clause implications in a way there

18

wouldn't be if you were simply renting property in downtown

19

San Francisco?

20

MR. EAGAN:

Now, there would there not be

Well, the example used -- It is hard

21

to conceive a mere transit use being something that could

22

generate a rent.

23

could construct things where it could set up a legitimate

24

or colorable lease for that type of situation, yes, the

25

state would be subject to the commerce clause.

But, conceding somehow that the state

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The question

1

then becomes where is the remedy, is it with Congress solely

2

or is there some monitoring role that this Court has to

3

perform?

4

And, if there is a monitoring role this Court

5

has, we are quite willing to subject to scrutiny the amounts

6

of particular rents that may be charged in the future by

7

the State Lands Commission with regard to particular ground

8

leases.

9
10

QUESTION:

What sort of scrutiny would be imposed?

MR. EAGAN:

This Court very well might be reluctant

11

to get into that thicket, because in the tax field it

12

occasionally has demonstrated some reticence about getting

13

into numbers, calculations.

14

is a prime example.

15

there has to be some apparent relationship between benefits

16

provided by the state and the tax in that case paid for

17

the severence of coal.

18

say, geez, we really don't think that is an appropriate

19

function for this Court and we are going to defer to Congress.

20

And, Congress — that is not an idle alternative.

21

does review these things and does respond when pressure

22

is brought concerning this type of consideration.

23

Commonwealth versus Edison

The Court was content there to say

And, this Court very well might

Congress

I think the Evansville case is a good example.

24

In that case, this Court upheld a user tax authorizing or

25

validating a volumetric charge, if you will, in the form

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

of a tax by the Evansville Airport Authority.
QUESTION:

Mr. Eagan, supposed a state owned a

3

lot of land and part of it is cut up by a deep canyon and

4

they built a bridge across that canyon.

5

would interfere with the state charging any fee they wanted

6

for crossing that bridge?

7

MR. EAGAN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

What is there that

Well —
No navigable stream involved, just

a dry, great big dry hole.
MR. EAGAN:

Well, one, they would be entitled

11

to charge something for it, no question.

12

Honor, they would be entitled to charge something.

13

No question, Your

In terms of what constraints there might be, there

14

very well might be a practical constraint, as we maintain

15

there is in this case.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Are there other alternatives?

Suppose they charged on the basis of

tonnage, weight?
MR. EAGAN:

That is not uncommon.

Apparently

19

for coal rights-of-way that is a common means of charging

20

for use of a —

21

QUESTION:

You might charge an automobile that

22

weighed about two tons at most, you charge one fee, but

23

if a great big truck is going to cross that weighs 20 tons,

24

you charge him a good deal more.

25

that that you know of?

Is there any barrier to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. EAGAN:

1

Well, let's assume that we have analyzed

2

the market participants -- or at least the availability

3

of other practical alternatives and the Court has found

4

there are none.

5

may not concern itself.

6

the persons had.

7

It seems to me if there are, then the Court
There are other alternatives that

But, if there are no alternatives, then the decision

8

is is there a role for this Court to play and, if so, what

9

is the test it should apply in evaluating that type of per

10

ton of vehicle moving across this bridge in Your Honor's

11

example?

12

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Chief Justice's question

13

was couldn't the state charge based on the amount of tonnage,

14

in short, a charge commensurate to how the bridge was used?

15

MR. EAGAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

Yes, Your Honor, I think they could.
There wouldn't be any problem about

that, would there?

18

MR. EAGAN:

19

QUESTION:

I —
But, that isn't in this case, is it,

20

because it doesn't make any difference about wear and tear

21

on the state's property, how much volume is carried.

22
23
24
25

MR. EAGAN:

Well, there is volume, of course,

depending on -QUESTION:

Yes, there is, but the state's property

that is used in this case isn't going to deteriorate because
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

twice as much volume is in one year than in another.

2
3

MR. EAGAN:

Your Honor, that is true of any ground

lease.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. EAGAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. EAGAN:

Well —
And, if you -So it is true of this one, right?
It is certainly true of this ground

8

lease.

9

type of focus leads is back into the user tax cases where

10

the person is limited to cost reimbursement solely and no

11

type, no type of ground lease is so limited, whether we

12

are talking about variable rent or fixed annual rent of

13

the type endorsed here by the oil companies.

14
15
16
17

It is true of every ground lease.

QUESTION:

And, where that

Mr. Eagan, do you recognize any con­

straints on rent by reason of the import/export clause?
MR. EAGAN:

Not by reason of the import/export

clause, no, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. EAGAN:

None at all?
It just is not applicable to rent

20

if we are dealing in fact with a ground lease and indisputably

21

that is what we are dealing with here.

22

QUESTION:

Of course, that clause and the tonnage

23

clause both were intended, weren't they, to prevent coastal

24

states like California from exploiting their geographic

25

positions at the expense of sister states, do they not?

(202) 628-9300

1

2

MR. EAGAN:

But, the corollary — It is true enough,

Your Honor, but the corollary --

3

QUESTION:

Yet you say there is no concern at

4

all in measuring a propriety of the rent with that considera­

5

tion?

6

MR. EAGAN:

This concern of the framers of the

7

Constitution finds expression in a number of clauses and

8

three of them probably central are the commerce clause and

9

the import/export clause.

Now,

we will concede that they

10

are all trying to get at the same potential problem, but

11

they focus on different means that might be used by the

12

states to affect this.

13

QUESTION:

Well, let me put it this way.

If you

14

are clear under the commerce clause, does that mean you

15

are also clear under the import/export clause?

16

MR. EAGAN:

The analysis proceeds independently.

17

It seems to us when you are talking about rent there is

18

a clear quid pro quo.

19

you are entitled to that under the import/export clause.

20

Clearly a ground rent a fortiori is out from under the

21

import/export clause.

22

Even if you are talking about a tax,

The real issue in this case is whether the commerce

23

clause has anything to say about the rent, the mode of rent

24

that is being used here by the Commission.

25

QUESTION:

Well, do you think you could just refuse
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

to lease at all?
MR. EAGAN:

3

Yes, Your Honor.

One example might

be — suppose we are approached by --

export clause considerations.

MR. EAGAN:

QUESTION:

15

(Laughter)

16

MR. EAGAN:

Just like off-shore oil drilling.
I am not saying -Which wouldn't be fencible, would it?
That is not in my section, Your Honor.
Yes.

If there is a monopoly, which there

17

clearly is not here, but if there were a monopoly, indeed,

18

you may get into motivation.

19

if there is a good faith motive for saying to an oil company

20

we are not going to lease to you because where you want

21

to lease there is environmental considerations that cut

22

against that type of use.

23

Certainly though in our view,

But, if you had a situation such as Oklahoma versus

24

How does the oil company use the state

property?

MR. EAGAN:

Well, the prime example and obvious

example would be Standard Oil's Longworth in Richmond.

5

It is on the East Bay and I think currently is about 33

6

acres of property.

7

a wharf on it and underneath the wharf are pipelines and

land which is subject to certain common law public trust.

MR. EAGAN:

to try to draw a distinction between improved property,

5

where, say, the state provides the wharf, and the situation

6

that usually obtains here, unimproved ground, all that goes

7

to, it seems to me, Your Honor, is the amount that is likely

to be negotiated for the charge.

that even though they provide improvements, a portion of

the volumetric return that the ports gets is a return on

the land.

12

It is clear from the record

There is no question about that.
And, there are also clear instances in the record

where the ports themselves lease unimproved land and where

the company provides the improvements, yet nonetheless a

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. VERLEGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and

may it please the Court:
Let me start with this point, I think, and sort

17

of pick up where we were a minute ago.

18

the English Crown, the original 13 states, we are thought

19

generally considered to have acquired the tide and submerged

20

lands underlying the harbors and the rivers of each of their

21

states from the moment when those 13 states were formed.

22

It also, I think, has not been disputed on this record,

23

and I don't believe can be, that as the other states joined

24

the Union they came to acquire similar rights.

25

If one

1

U.S., but there are many cases that state that proposition

2

and I won't belabor it.

3

Now, the second point, one has this basic picture

4

that the states started out owning the tide and submerged

5

lands that underlay the harbors and the adjacent coastline.

6

Now let me say that in U.S. v. California it was established

7

they didn't own out to the three mile limit, but Congress

8

promptly in effect reversed that decision with the Submerged

9

Lands Act and it has since been clear -- and this, I believe,

10

corresponds pretty well to the general thinking about the

11

law at an earlier date -- that they had this band that borders

12

along the ocean.

13

Now that is the first basic proposition.

A second basic proposition is that the commerce

14

clause, the import/export clause and the tonnage clause

15

were of fundamental importance in the very adoption of the

16

Constitution.

17

of the cases of this Court, including Michelin Tire and

18

others, speak strongly of the fact that in the years of

19

the Articles of Confederation, the first ten years roughly

20

of the Republic, they are proliferated, there grew a bale

21

of assorted tariffs, barriers, and restraints of one kind

22

or another that the states adopted not only with respect

23

to foreign imports but with respect to each other.

tion that follows independently of the state law.

13

not think that the states are free to use their tide and

what we are talking about here.
QUESTION:

And those leases cover lands that are

used to carry oil from somewhere else?
MR. VERLEGER:

Those leases cover basically lands

5

that are used for pipelines to bring oil from ships that

6

are anchored either by docks or in some instances out at

7

sea in water that is two or three hundred feet deep, to

8

bring that in to the refinery.

9

from offshore platforms.

10

They are used to carry oil

And, one of the interesting features in the argument

11

that has been made by a lessee in this case is that it points

12

to the absolute necessity of a commerce clause review and

13

import/export review of these various -- of these terms.

14

They have said there are all these little municipalities

15

that have similar positions.

16

Well, we have a brief from Santa Monica which

17

deals with one of them.

out that there is a pipeline that comes ashore and it then

19

goes down through a half a dozen municipalities and finally

20

reaches a refinery.

It is true enough as they point

Now, I submit that unless some principle such

as that found in the user cases continues to be applicable

2

where a shipper in the United States is going to be roughly

3

in the same position as a trader in the Middle Ages when

4

he had to pay a duty at every little castle that he passed

5

from Frankfort, let's say, down to Italy.
QUESTION:

6

Well, supposing that California had

7

totally socialized real property, that only the state owned

8

real property, and your clients wanted to lease a place

9

from the state to have a service station and it was in

10

Bakersfield, it had nothing to do with the coastline at

all.

if it were a service station were going to be moving in

charge whatever it wanted to ground lease that land to an

15

oil company for a service station?

16

Nonetheless, obviously, the cars that pulled in there

Would you say that the state couldn't

MR. VERLEGER:

When it comes to leasing land they

17

owned in Bakersfield for a service station, I don't know

18

of any barrier to their leasing whatever they want.

19

The think the basic difference here is we are

20

talking about a means of commerce.

21

the mechanism by which property comes across the border

22

into the state, and we are saying that the state cannot,

23

by calling what it collects rent, collect exactly the same

24

charges it would as a tariff and legitimatize the charge

25

by changing its label.

QUESTION:

Well, can the state, Mr. Verleger,

charge a reasonable rent under your view?
MR. VERLEGER:
but that they can.
QUESTION:

There is no question in my mind

Let me say in that connection -Well, the state court said this was

a reasonable rent.
MR. VERLEGER:

Well, the state court was reviewing

8

that in terms of its standard for the review of an

9

administrative agency, its decision, which at least in

10

California -- and actually a legislative decision.

11

in California the rule under those circumstances is -- gives

12

the agency so much discretion that I don't know -- All you

13

can do is treat it as a finding that the agency didn't use

14

its discretion.

15
16

And,

It is a different issue.

QUESTION:

Well, if a volumetric rent is a typical

sort of a rent for pipeline use --

17

MR. VERLEGER:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. VERLEGER:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. VERLEGER:

It isn't.

It is not?
No.

If it were, would it be reasonable.
In this particular instance I would

22

say not because the Constitution — take imports first.

23

Expressly under the import/export clause it forbids a duty

24

or an impost.

25

figures a dollar collected for every barrel that comes in.

A duty or impost is, let us say, in round

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And I submit that a dollar collected for every barrel that

2

has come in is the same thing regardless as to what you

3

call it.

4

Now, beyond that I would submit that we have a

5

very close analogy in the tonnage tax cases which dealt

6

very much with that problem.

7

were concerned over the problem of evasion of the provision

8

forbidding impost and duties and they adopted the tonnage

9

clause because they were fearful that it would be evaded

10

by charging the ship instead of the cargo.

11

Now, the --

12

QUESTION:

13

The founders of the Constitution

Counsel, what would you consider to

be a reasonable rent?

MR. VERLEGER:

Well, I would consider -- They

way.

17

property.

18

then determined the going rate of rental for industrial

19

property in the area which they fixed at eight percent of

20

its value and they charged it and our people paid it.

21

The rent was fixed in this

They appraised the value of the property as industrial
They used comparable industrial property.

Now, in this instance, the leases still require

22

that reasonable rate of rent.

23

on to it the percentage rent, the through-put rent — what

24

we call the tariff -- as something extra.

25

with the rental based on the reasonable value of the property.

Then they go on and file

We have no quarrel

(202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. VERLEGER:

3

You consider the other more rental?
The other is more rent and the

answer is since it is fixed on the basis of the commodity —

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. VERLEGER:

And, it is unreasonable.
More than unreasonable.

We think

6

it is unconstitutional because essentially if you look at

7

both of the cases that deal with imposts -- Michelin Tire

8

was very careful to say that this was not a charge for

9

simple entry into the country.

10

In the tonnage tax cases the court was explicit

11

in saying the state or the city -- because those cases treat

12

the state and the city as the same -- could charge for

13

facilities they provided but could not charge for the use

14

of the unimproved bank of the river and that is essentially

15

what we have here.

16

Now, if -- Let me say as I go further in that

17

connection that one of my puzzles in this connection has

18

been the degree to which this case raises issues of the

19

Montana Power and the Louisiana v. Maryland and the issues

20

raised in the commerce clause and in import cases generally.

21

My reasons for uncertainty is simply that first

22

of all in the first sentence of their brief the state recites

23

that we do not — the first sentence of the reply brief --

24

that we do not contend — the words are "without question

25

a simple charge for the privilege of bringing merchandise

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

into the country would be prohibited under the import/export

2

clause."

That is the first sentence of the reply.
And, similarly, while I see no such concession

3
4

as to commerce, I see no connected argument anywhere that

5

this kind of a charge is all right under the commerce clause

6

and I hesitate, therefore, to embark on a debate that may

7

not be before this Court at this time at all and yet I am

8

a little concerned that if I say nothing on it the subject

9

may be the subject of a decision to which I have contributed

10

very little because one hesitates to answer an argument

11

that hasn't been made.

12

Let me say, therefore, simply these things.

That

13

is it is my belief that the Court's most recent cases

14

recognize the necessity of preserving something like the

15

doctrine of the user tax cases here, to start with Evansville

16

which says that the charge of one dollar per passenger at

17

an airport was all right because it didn't exceed cost.

18

It is a 1982 decision.

It is a relatively modern decision.

19

To continue, in Montana Power this Court speaks

20

of the invalidity of a tax which bears no relationship to

21

the taxpayer's activities and it goes forward and refers

22

to Nippert v. Richmond and Michigan-Wisconsin Pipeline v.

23

Calvert.

24

impractical operation they taxed more severely on interstate

25

commerce.

Now, both of those cases were cases where

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And, let me say simply that if one looks at the

2

Army Engineers' statistics that our friends and the others

3

have cited, it will practically appear that quite literally

4

when it comes to crude oil this law has its application

5

essentially 100 percent to imports and to interstate commerce

6

and as to products it must be in the order of 90 percent.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Verleger, I guess there is no doubt

that Congress couldn't allow California by statute to charge

these rents.

QUESTION:

There is nothing the Submerged Lands

Act or any other statute would suggest -MR. VERLEGER:

I think the question of how this would affect the application

to the oil brought in from federal leases, if it became

25

prohibitively high, is a question that was involved in

it is presented on the record here.

this whole coastline to private interest.

charge you any rent they wanted?

to speak to it.

The problem is we don't have it against the state.

QUESTION:

Exactly, you don't.

15

QUESTION:

May I ask just one question on your

16

theory?

17

MR. VERLEGER:

18

QUESTION:

Sure.

Are you taking the position that no

19

matter how reasonable the level of the rent might be, they

20

can never use the volumetric formula?

21

MR. VERLEGER:

It is our sense that — particularly

22

under the import/export clause that the volumetric formula

23

applied on imports produces exactly the same result as a

24

tariff in the same amount.

25

state could not apply a tariff no matter how reasonable

Now, it is very clear that the

42

(202) 628-9300

1

it was.

2

in complete thought of transit because you have got an express

3

prohibition.

4

I have trouble with anything that permits them to do the

5

same thing because it is obvious that from the beginning

6

they owned all this real estate and while they have sold

7

off some of it they have still got most of it.

And that, I think, irrespective of all the criteria

So, they can't have a reasonable tariff.

8

The cities I count as the same thing. It seems

9

to me no defense at all to say that the cities are doing

10

the same thing.

11

QUESTION:

And, is it your understanding of the

12

Ninth Circuit that that is what they held; that you cannot

13

use this formula for the tidelands and the submerged lands

14

on the border of the state.

MR. VERLEGER:

1

I also urge, even though the cases

2

I have to rely on are older, that a straight tariff, something

3

that says you have got to pay fifty cents a bushel or a

4

barrel to come into a state -- into California from Nevada,

5

for instance, unless justified under the rules of the user

is a good example.

the latter.
MR. VERLEGER:

I do.

Well, we are concerned with both

Well, I know, but in the commerce clause

one -- That argument wouldn't necessarily -- You wouldn't

17

necessarily win on that based on any volumetric no matter

18

how small.

19

MR. VERLEGER:

No.

I think that in the commerce

20

clause the critical question is the relation to cost idea

21

that appears in the user tax cases.

22

of the special situation of transportation across state

23

lines that — It seems to me the constitutional necessity

24

that there be a prohibition on a simple set of tariffs that

25

are put up by states at the border, that that doctrine remains

I think that because

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

essential and I note that in Footnote 12 in the Montana --

2

in the Commonwealth Edison v. Montana Power this Court gives

3

a continued effect of that doctrine in situations that are

4

sort of quasi proprietary.

5

And this is pretty much that situation.

6

That is what the note said.

So, I would conclude that that doctrine arranged

7

an essential there as to interstate commerce as well as

8

foreign commerce.

9

It seems to me that the use of title as a vehicle

10

for the imposition of creation of a barrier, however small,

11

at the state border is just as undesirable for interstate

12

commerce as it is for foreign and I note that in Michelin

13

Tire this Court has sought to amalgamate the concepts of

14

the import/export clause and the commerce clause to the

15

extent feasible.

16

commerce clause ideas and apply them to the import/export

17

clause, but I would submit as one looks at the necessity

18

of a protection against a true sort of barrier at the border

19

that the same logic applies.

20

In that case what was done was to take

Let me add that there are plenty of situations

21

that illustrate the necessity.

It is a fact, for instance,

22

that oil from Alaska comes ashore in Long Beach.

23

is put into what is known as the four-corner pipeline.

It traverses the City of Los Angeles, it crosses the state's

Second, I do want to clarify -- and I can do it

by reference to the record — that we are not talking about

a volumetric charge here that is added on to an eight percent

10

return.

11

a minimum rent, but that minimum rent is applied as a credit

12

against the volumetric rent and you very well may have

13

situations where all that is paid is the minimum rent because

14

the volume has not been sufficient enough to generate a

15

volumetric rent over the minimum.

This is just like a percentage lease.
