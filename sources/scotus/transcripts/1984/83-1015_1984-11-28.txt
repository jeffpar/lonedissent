there was any tasis for the District Court to make its
broad exceptions and in effect to,

we believe, tc read

ouit of the law this Court's prior holdings and the
clear language of the statute.

In connection with the

setting of a special election date,we think that there
could hardly be anything which is more clearly a
standard practice or procedure regarding an election.
The specific language of the sttaute seems to cover
that.

The prior cases of this Court, the consistent

practice of the United States Department of Justice, the
potential for discrimination that resides in the ahility
to set an election date with essentially no standards,
no guidance, and finally, we think that -QUESTION;

Let me get your reaction.

KB. DERFNEE:

Yes, Hr. Chief Justice.

In setting the time, what are the

factors that could be used for or against?

Hew would

the time enter into it?
I can see you wouldn't — sometimes time is a
factor that the farmers can't come in if they are
engaged in harvesting and things of that kind?
What would be the factors here?
HR. DERFNER;

Okay.

The question is, I gather

you are asking that in what way could

And I should remark that in the last two

8

categories, there have teen cases in the lower courts,

9

not from South Carolina, which have found election dates

10

to he discriminatory because of those reasons, both

11

cases frem Texas, as I recall.

12

So there is a lot of potential fcr

13

discrimination in the setting of a date, and that is the

14

factor which leads the Voting Fights Act to say that

15

this is something that the Department cf Justice cught

to consider.

QUESTION:

Sc that a Section 5 inquiry would

be a neutral eye cast cn that?
NR. DERFNER:

20

Section 5 inquiry I would think would also lcck at the

21

conditions precedent to the election, specifically, what

22

is the filing peried?

department could have found in this situation that

24

holding a ftarch election without a new filing peried

25

would make that election date itself discriminatory.

And I wculd think that the

Q

(202) 628-9300

So there are a world of ways.
I should say that the Appellees, I think, they
do not really challenge this view because on page 27 of
the Election — I'm sorry,

the School Eoard’s brief,

they say we agree -- they agree, in effect, that an
election date set by statute would have to be
precleared, and they seek to draw an exception for
something which is set by simple administrative
decision.
I would think that there is certainly nc
exception, that this Court's cases have dealt with
administrative decisions, informal, ad hoc decisions, as
well as they have with statutes, and in fact, if
anything is more of a danger under the Voting Rights
Act, I

should think it would be ncnstatutcry changes.
As to the filing period, as to the filing

period, I think it is equally clear, in fact, the cases
of this Court make it clearer because the very first
couple of cases, the Allen case, the Hadnott case, dealt
specifically with filing periods.

Sc I think there

could hardly be an argument that setting a filing period
is r.ot something that has tc be covered by Section 5.
"The Appellees say, though, following the
District Court, that in this case the Attorney General
did preclear the filing period because when he sent his

he precleared, we think there is another reason why the

3

Appellees shouldn't have been able to use the old filing

QUESTION;

Yes.

Supposing the Attorney General had

cleared the Act 549 in October, would you make the same
argume nt ?
HE. DEBFNEE:

Yes, I think I would. Justice

Stevens, because while it is true that there have teen a
number of instances in which filing periods cr ether
situations have gone forward without somebody suing
them, I think the law is clear that an act may net be
enforced, and what you have is citizens who read the
that Voting Rights Act says nothing can be enforced
until it is precleared, and if a citizen is entitled to
rely on the law, then I think a citizen should not be
forced

to the choice of going to file at a time when the

law has not been precleared.
So if what you are saying is that —

9

Supposing he was fully advised, there was adequate

advice, and the question was whether he could then

approve of an election in November based on filings that

12

had taken place just before cthe preclearance, and he

knew all about what had happened.

13

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING APPELLANTS

14

MR. STRAUSS*

15

I

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

16

Before I turn to the merits of this case, I

17

would like to say a word atcut why the resolution of the

18

questions presented can have an important effect on the

19

Attorney General’s ability to carry out his

20

responsibilities under Section E of the Voting Rights

21

Act.

22

The major theme of the Appellees’ argument and

23

the'District Court’s opinion, as I read it, is that the

24

Attorney General can be dee med to have precleared

25

changes implicitly, that is to

say, he can be deemed to

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

have cleared them even though he was not aware that he

2

was clearing them, and even though in this case he cid

3

not know of the changes and could not possibly have

4

knovin about the changes because they had not even teen

5

instituted at the time he issued his preclearance.

6

Now, this argument in one form or another has

7

been made to the Court on several occasions in Allen, in

8

Sheffield County, and

9

Mr. Derfner pointed out, it has been repeatedly rejected

just last term in McCain, and as

10

by the Court.

11

is that the practicalities of administering Section 5

12

make it very important that as the Attorney General's

13

regulations require, covered jurisdictions make a clear

14

statement in their submission of exactly what changes

15

they are seeking to have precleared, and that no changes

16

be deemed precleared except on the basis of such a clear

17

submis sicn .

18

Eut the point I would like to emphasize

Now, the reason that is important is that as

19

Congress recognized, and as cur experience in

20

administering Section 5 has shewn, a lot of the threats

21

to equality in voting occur at the level of low

22

visibility nuts and bolts electoral decisions that can

23

only be properly evaluated in a particular local

24

context.

25

Voting

For example, the legislative history of the

Eights Act mentions a change from paper ballets
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

to voting machines as the kind of change that would have
to he precleared, and in Perkins, an early decision,
this Court held that a change in voting places had to be
precle ared.
Sc when the Attorney General is presented with
a scheme, he doesn't just decide in the abstract, on the
basis of some broad presumption, whether the scheme is
discriminatory.

He has to look at whether the

particular elements of that scheme, in the particular
context, will have a discriminatory purpose and effect.
And in doing sc, of course, he has to rely to a large
extent on input from people at the local level who are
familiar with the scheme.
Sew,

this whole process just can’t operate

unless the Attorney General and people in the local
community knew exactly what changes they are addressing
and what problems they are examining in the local
con tax t.
Here the jurisdiction did not specify the
particular elements of the scheme that they now claim
were precleared, and in fact, the election date, as I
said,

hadn’t even been set at the time that the Attorney

General precleared Act 549.

is, point out that when the Attorney General cleared Act

twc and a half months after the first eractuent cf Act
549 before they submitted it at all.

And since the

Attorney General must act within sixty days, a delay of
twc and a half months was what put them in the
predicament they found themselves in.
The second contributing factor to the
confusion in this case was the fact that the Attorney
General initially interposed an objection.

But as Mr.

Derfner explained that objection, the interposition cf
that objection and subsequent withdrawal were not the
result cf confusior, or bureaucratic ineptitude,; there
was a very serious, very substantial question whether
that act was discriminatory, and that was the basis for
the initial objection.
I have one final point.

The Section 5 was, of

course, very controversial when the Voting Bights Act
was first passed because it was thought by some to
intrude unreasonably into state and local government
affairs, but our experience suggests that now, almost 20
years later, the covered jurisdictions have accommodated
themselves to Section 5 and find it to be an acceptable
and minimal burden at most.

The Attorney General has

issued regulations specifying the form that submissions
are to take.

The covered jurisdictions know that all

changes are submitted.

They submit them routinely.
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

The

Attorney General acts very promptly, and nearly every
change

is promptly precleared.
Ambiguities in the scope cf the preclearance

requirement, such as those that are said to exist here,
are quite atypical.

They are very much the exception
)

and not the rule.
But if the Appellees and others -- excuse
me — are successful in carving out exceptions to this
preclearance regime, even though nothing in Section 5
supports the creation cf such exceptions,

net only would

the result be inconsistent with Congress' intent, but in
the long run, this disintegrating erosion cf particular
exceptions, as Justice Cardcza said, would net ever be
of particular benefit to the covered jurisdictions
because it wculd inject elements cf uncertainty and
confusion and litigation into what has become an
essentially stable and mutually acceptable state of
affairs under Section 5.

as far as our experience suggests the covered
