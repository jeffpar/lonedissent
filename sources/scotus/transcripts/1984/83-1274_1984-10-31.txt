Hr. Zirn, ycu may

MB. ZINN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
This case is here on appeal from the Supreme

Court

of Alabama.

At issue is the validity of Alabama’s

10

domestic preference tax statute under

the ecual

11

protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

12

grants a tax preference to domestic life insurance

13

companies by imposing a tax of one percent on their

14

gross premiums, while imposing a tax of three percent or

15

three times that amount on the gross premiums of

16

out-of-state life insurance companies.

Alabama

Alabama grants a tax preference tc domestic

17
18

property casualty insurance companies by imposing a

on their gross premiums of one percent, and imposing a

tax on

21

So in its basic

structure the Alabama domestic

also contains a so-called investment incentive

provision.

reduce its tax rate four four percent -- from three

company; and if it's a property casualty insurance
