CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

We will hear arguments

next in Mitchell against Forsyth.

Mr. Bator.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. BATOR, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. BATOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court, in this case the Solicitor General

9

represents former Attorney General John N. Mitchell in a

10
11

lawsuit that was filed

13 years ago, in 1972.

During these 13 years the court system has

12

been struggling to solve the guestion whether Mr.

13

Mitchell should personally pay damages to the plaintiff

14

because in 1970 he as Attorney General authorized a

15

telephone tap on the phone of one Davidon.

16

This was in December, 1970, and this telephone

17

tap lead to the overhearing of three conversations to

18

which the plaintiff was a party.

19

QUESTION:

20

at their inception?

Were those conversations the target

21

MR. BATOR*

Not .specifically.

Davidonwas the

22

target of the tap, Your Honor.

23

because the FBI had information that there was an

24

organization called ECCSL, of which Davidon was a

25

member, which was planning to blow up the utility

Davidon was tapped

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

tunnels under the Federal Triangle here in Washington,

2

D.C.
There was also FBI information that ECCL

3
4

members, including Davidon, had discussed the

5

possibility of kidnapping Dr. Henry Kissinger, who was

6

then Assistant to the President for National Security

7

Affairs.

8
9

The District Court made an elaborate inquiry
into the purpose of these taps, and explicitly found

10

that they were installed in order to protect the

11

national security by obtaining information and

12

preventing these bombing and kidnapping activities.

13

And I refer the Court to the District Court

14

opinion at 56 to 60 of the Appendix to our Petition,

15

where the District Court makes it clear that the purpose

16

was prevention, not prosecution.

17

Now, at the time these wiretaps were

18

authorized, this Court’s Keith case, which for the first

19

time held that a warrant had to be obtained for wiretaps

20

involving domestic national security concerns, that case

21

had not yet been decided.

22

Court itself stated that it was deciding a question of

23

first impression, came down in *72, a year and a half

24

after these wiretaps were placed and removed.

25

The Keith case,

in which the

These wiretaps were placed on the basis of a
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

legal position that had been maintained in an unbroken

2

tradition by every Attorney General and every President

3

for over 25 years.

4
5

QUESTION:

Does it not go back even more than

that?
MR. BATOR:

6

My research, Your Honor, shows

7

simply, that it was -- there are things in this record

8

that indicate in 25 years -QUESTION:

9

One case, I thought, in either this

10

Court or the Court of Appeals referred to a memorandum

11

from Franklin Roosevelt to the Attorney General

12

Jackson.
MR. BATOR:

13

That may very well be, Your

14

Honor.

In the packet that we have, the first thing we

15

have is from Attorney General Brownell.

16

was, the substance of the position was that the

17

President did have constitutional authority without a

18

judicial warrant to order electronic surveillances where

19

he was acting to protect the national security against

20

threats of domestic violence and terrorism.

The position

21

At the time the Davidon tap was installed,

22

that position had never been rejected in any federal

23

court,

24

District Courts.

25

rejected by this Court in Keith, and this case is really

and had recently been upheld in two Federal
Now, of course that position was

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

one of a number of cases in which the Courts have been

2

struggling with the question of what to do about

3

pre-Keith taps, how do we untangle the question of what

4

to do about these surveillances, that took place without

5

a judicial warrant at a time when the legal situation

6

was subject to fundamental uncertainty.

7

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Bator, even if you are

8

100 parcent correct on the qualified immunity question,

9

what about the review of that at this stage, the

10

appealability question, which seems to me to be a

11

tougher question than the one on the merits?

12

MR. BATOR;

Well, Your Honor, we agree, and I

13

am happy to turn to it if you would like me to, although

14

I do want to come back and say perhaps a word or two

15

about the merits of the qualified immunity issue.

16

The appealability issue arises because the

17

Court of Appeals held that a District Judge's rejection

18

of a defendant's claim of qualified immunity does not at

19

that point become appealable.

20

until the case goes to final judgment, that means

21

usually after trial and after -- after discovery and

22

after trial, before he appeals.

The defendant has to wait

23

The Courts of Appeals are simply divided three

24

to three on this issue, and that is why we are here, and

25

I have four,

I think, simple points to make about
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

appealability, Justice O'Connor.

2

this Court's cases.

The first one is about

3

This Court's cases on appealability are not

4

easily organized into a tidy scheme, but the cases do

5

convey one central unifying theme, and that is that if

6

postponing appeal until the end of the case would in

7

some serious way undermine or subvert the policies of

8

the very rule whose correct application is in question,

9

then the considerations are very strongly in favor of

10

immediate appeal if certain technical requirements, if

11

the Court of Appeals is in a position effectively and

12

definitively to decide the question at this point.

13

That, we think, is the thrust of Abney and

14

Helstoski, United States v. Nixon, Nixon v. Fitzgerald.

15

If a District Court rules, rejects a defense whose

16

purpose is to give a threshold immunity to the burdens

17

of discovery at trial, then appeal should be permitted.

18

QUESTION:

Well,

was there some factual

19

dispute here about whether the wiretap was motivated by

20

national security concerns, so is it enmeshed in the

21

merits, and so forth?

22

MR. BATOR:

lour Honor, we do not think that

23

there was really any relevant factual dispute at all.

24

In fact, the District Court here ruled that qualified

25

immunity may not be had as a matter of law.
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The

1

District Court had no problem in ruling with this

2

question as a matter of law, and we think it can be

3

easily ruled on now as a matter of law.

4

The record shows, without any problems, with

5

multiple support, and the District Court found that the

6

purpose of the wiretap was to find out about and prevent

7

these threats to the national security.

8

ample basis on this record to do exactly what the Court

9

in Harlow said the courts ought to try to do with these

There is ample,

10

cases,

which is to take the objective facts and

11

determine whether on the basis of the objective facts

12

there was or was not a violation of a clearly

13

established constitutional rule.
Now, the respondent says, no, you can't do

14
15

that here and you can't do it anywhere, because these

16

qualified immunity rulings are always mixed up and

17

complicated issues of fact and purpose and motive,

18

we think that that is just another way of saying that

19

this Court, when it tried in Harlow to create an

20

objective test that could be determined on the basis of

21

a threshold inquiry as a quick, if you will, a quick

22

cure on the issue, in order to serve the very purposes

23

of the rule, the Court said, we will try to structure

24

the inquiry so we can have a definitive objective

25

ruling .
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

but

And what the respondent is really saying here

1

2

is that this Court simply won't be allowed to do or

3

simply didn't know what it was about when it was doing

4

that.

That is to say that that is not possible.
We think it is totally unproblematical for an

5

6

appellate court to do exactly what the District Court

7

does at that point, which is to decide as a matter of

8

law is the defendant entitled to qualified immunity, and

9

we think that this quick appeal is absolutely crucial to

10

achieving the purposes of Harlow.

11

What was the point of Harlow?

12

QUESTION:

Kay I ask, Mr. Bator, are you going

13

to argue the question whether 2520 limits the defense so

14

21

I hadn't planned to, Your Honor,

That's the one that —
— the Title 3.
Yes, the only defense to the

officials is those set forth in 2520?
MR. BATOR;

Your Honor, our position on that

22

is that 2520 doesn't limit because Title 3 is basically

23

inapplicable to this entire situation.

24

only is in play if the plaintiff has a good cause of

25

action under Title 3.

That is, 2520

ME. BATOR;

3

Then it may be that 2520 might

Honor,

and it might be that the clearly established rule

6

might still operate.

7

You haven’t briefed it very fully.

You have just brushed it aside.

that.

13

QUESTIONj

I wonder if we can do

But you say Title 3 isn't involved

at all because of Keith?
MR. BATOR;

Our position is that Title 3 is

totally inapplicable --

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. BATOR ;

Because of Keith?
— and this Court made that

16

absolutey clear in Keith, so the Court doesn't really

17

need to reach the question of what would be the

18

situation with respect to immunity.

Your Honor, our submission on the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

because I have been puzzled by the extent to which Title

2

3 is relevant.

opponent’s brief that I didn’t read that way.

10
11

Is it clear that the only liability that

That there is any Title 3 issue at

all.
MR. BATOR:

14

I don’t believe so, Your Honor,

15

and of course it is on the Bivens issue where the issue

16

of qualified immunity and its appealability arises, so

17

we believe that really is the only issue on which we are

18

here,

19

as far as our petition for certiorari goes.
I want to return to appealability and its

20

connection with the purpose of the Harlow rule, because

21

that really is our central submission to this Court.

22

The purpose of Harlow was to provide a

23

definitive pretrial adjudication, and what all of this

24

Court’s cases say is that if the purpose of a rule is to

25

prevent a defendant from having to undergo the burdens
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of discovery and trial, as in the case of qualified

2

immunity, that that should be resolved as quickly as

3

possible at —

4

QUESTION*

Doesn't that argument prove too

5

much?

Doesn't every motion to dismiss oc motion for

6

summary judgment have that very purpose?
HB. BATORs

7

Well, we think there is a critical

8

distinction.

That is to say, it is the case that there

9

are a lot of defenses which have as a point the purpose

10

of ending -- preventing an unmeritorious trial, and we

11

do agree that if that is the only claim that could be

12

made, that is, appeal now in order to prevent the

13

defendant from having to go through an unmeritorious

14

trial, that would be the case with the statute of

15

limitations defense or a res judicata defense.
Eut we think there is a critical distinction.

16
17

The qualified immunity doctrine has an additional

18

element.

19

to evade the burdens of discovery at trial not simply as

20

a matter of fairness to the individual defendant.

21

is a matter of general public policy here.

Qualified immunity treats — allows defendants

There

22

That is to create a general rule, a general

23

regime in which officials at the time they are making

24

decisions are not unduly chilled and constrained in

25

decisionmaking by the prospect of burdensome litigation,

unmeritorious litigation# and possible ruinous personal

recovery.
Now,

3

as the justification for expedited appeal

in the context of qualified immunity is that if appeal

is postponed this general public policy will be erode!

12

liability.
NR. BATOR s

13

A lot of times you

I think, Your Honor,

that the sort

14

of the central, central theme of distinction is that it

15

is not enough for a defendant to say I want to come up

16

now, because otherwise I will have to go through a

17

trial,

18

to do it.

and yet I have a good defense.

It is like —

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

the expense and the annoyance and distress of defending

2

a lawsuit so that they can carry on their judicial

3

duties ?

4

HR. BATOR:

That is to say the central theme

5

here is, what is the effect of the system of appeal on

6

the underlying policy of the rule.

7

the absolute immunity rule with the double jeopardy rule

8

has the special public purpose.
QUESTION:

9

The Harlow rule with

Do you just make this argument when

10

there are no disputes on the facts?

11

suppose, disputed fact questions on a qualified immunity

12

case.
MR. BATOR:

13

You can have, I

Your Honor, if I am going to be

14

precise, I would make the argument not only where there

15

are no disputes, but only insofar as there are no

16

disputes.

17

about the fact, the District Court must rule whether the

18

plaintiff’s version of the facts,

19

complaint as true, whether the facts as stated in the

20

plaintiff's complaint constitute a violation of a

21

clearly established constitutional rule, so that even

22

though

23

the question whether even on the plaintiff's facts,

24

qualified immunity does or does not obtain, and that

25

would be available as an issue of law.

That is to say, even if there is a dispute

taking the plaintiff's

the defendant disputes the facts, there is still

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

This is an absolutely conventional problem

2

both for the District Court and the Court of Appeals of

3

passing only on those issues which it is now entitled to

4

pass on as a matter of law, bur the whole point of

5

Harlow was to make as many of these issues into issues

6

of la» as possible.
That was the whole point, because as the Court

7

8

said in Davis and Scherer, and this is the central

9

point,

an official can be unburdened from the chilling

10

effect of unmeritorious litigation only if the qualified

11

immunity issue is, and I think I am quoting the Court's

12

language, is quickly settled.

13

Now, we think expedited appeal is an adjunct

14

to the policy of Harlow in getting a quick settlement of

15

theissue of qualified immunity, and we are not saying

16

that every qualified immunity issue should be settled on

17

appeal, because there will be case where it depends

18

entirely on what the defendant did, but the Court is

19

conventionally used to separating out the question of

20

whether as a matter of law just on the plaintiff's

21

complaint or on the undisputed facts the defendant is or

22

is not entitled.

23

Now, I would like to just supplement what I

24

also said to the Chief Justice.

It isn't just the

25

immunity cases that present this central theme.
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The

1

state court cases that come up to this Court under 1257,

2

Potts and Tornelo and Curry and Landau, they also share

3

this common theme.

4

defenses that are rejected by the state court.

5

There we have various constitutional

The state litigation is not over, but the

6

court always says, if the point of the constitutional

7

defense is to prevent the defendant from being hauled

8

into the state court system, that is a very strong

9

argument in favor of expedited appeal, and what the

10

court said in Cox was exactly.

11

the constitutional defense has merit, there shouldn't be

12

a trial at all.

This is a case where if

13

Now, where that is the strong public policy,

14

we think that expedited appeal simply is an adjunct to

15

that public policy, and that is why there should be

16

expedited appeal.

17

I think that this case presents a vivid

18

example of why if qualified immunity is going to work,

19

expedited appeal really is a necessary adjunct.

20

a case where one would think that qualified immunity

21

ought to be an overwhelmingly accepted proposition.

22

Here is

I mean, here is a case where Attorney General

23

Mitchell acted on a question that the Court had

24

explicitly reserved in the Katz case, a question as to

25

which members of this Court had expressed disagreement

1

individually. Justice White, Justice Douglas had written

2

about it.
The lower court authority was overwhelmingly

3
4

in favor of the government position.

5

of executive practice, the position was controversial.

6

Now, out of this picture, to concoct a so-called clearly

7

established constitutional right, we submit, is to make

8

the Harlow rule a joke.

9

established constitutional rule, we think that the

Twenty-five years

If this is a clearly

10

Harlow rule becomes an empty shell, simply an invitation

11

retroactively to sort of invent clearly established

12

rights out of bits and pieces of what is in fact very

13

controversial and uncertain law.
Now, if it is the coseguence of really such a

14
15

patently unsupportable ruling that then the defendant

16

has to go through the whole affair of a very burdensome

17

process of discovery and trial, then it seems to me

18

Harlow becomes a very, very attenuated rule in its

19

purpos e .

20

We would also like on behalf of the

21

government, Your Honors, to urge the Court if it finds

22

that this issue is an appealable issue, that it should

23

turn to the qualified immunity issue and decide it for

24

Itself and not remand it to get the Third Circuit's —

MR. BATOR*

2

Well, Your Honor, this Court in

3

one of its precedents — it does not explicitly have

4

anything to do with this case, but one of this Court’s

5

precedents, the Helstoski case, holds that there should

6

be an immediate appeal if a speech and debate clause

7

defense is rejected.

8

Your Honor, we think that the materials are at

9

hand for a resolution of the qualified immunity issue in
i

10

11

the District Court decided that it was.

12

At Page 59A of the record appendix to the

13

petition for certiorari in the District Court opinion,

14

the District Court made it clear that it was leaving

15

open that question when it said, regardless of whether,

16

the Davidon wiretap was motivated by a legitimate

17

national security concern or a good faith belief that

18

there existed a national security concern as the

19

defendants contend, or was an invasion of the privacy of

20

political dissidence conducted under the guise cf

21

national security is a question we don't have to reach.

22

The District Court merely assumed that it may have been

23

a national security tap to reach the issue of qualified

24

immunity, since that was a threshold issue.

with respect to why this should be appealed on an

insubstantial suits at an early time.

The government

And Number Two, they say, parsing out those

cases in which there is a factual dispute, where there

8

is only a legal issue involved, a District Court and an

9

Appellate Court only has to apply settled legal

10

objective standards in determining whether there is

11

qualified immunity.

12

That, as Justice Stevens suggested in a

13

question to the government, is exactly true for pretrial

14

motions, dispositive motions filed by defendants in

15

civil cases, motions to dismiss based on failure to

16

state,a claim, motions for lack of jurisdiction,

17

statutes of limitations which also will terminate

"insubstantial suits against government defendants."

19

That is,

if the theory is that the government

20

defendant is entitled to termination of a suit, of an

21

insubstantial suit at an early stage, the rationale for

22

allowing appeals from qualified immunity would have to

be extended if principally done to virtually every

MR. RUDOVSKY:

The government is suggesting

that where there is an insubstantial claim against a

difference between the rationale behind absolute

immunity, where you have allowed appeals, speech and

debate, legislative absolute immunity, prosecutorial

4

immunity, and qualified immunity.

5

This Court in Harlow, while cautioning against

6

letting insubstantial claims go to trial, on the other

7

hand made it very clear that where the claim is

8

substantial, the claim must go to trial, so that if

9

there is a substantial claim, it goes to trial.

10

By contrast, absolute immunity, no matter how

11

substantial the claim, forecloses suit because of the

12

status and the function of the particular defendant.

13

You don’t even look at the Question of substantiality.

14

It could be the most substantial suit in the world with

respect to a violation of constitutional rights.

QUESTION*

Right.

In that case clearly

22

because there is absolute immunity, because of the

Harlow provided government defendants with a
substantial added protection.

It put on the same

footing qualified immunity as a pretrial issue as

opposed to a trial issue, which it was before Harlow.

By doing that, this Court surely did not intend that it

should be distinguished from all other pretrial

purpose?

What is in the record factually?
MR. RUDOVSKY;

2

There is an enormous amount of

3

information in the record with respect to the purpose.

4

Let me point just to a couple of factors from our side

5

which would create at least a factual dispute on that

6

poi nt.
Number One, it is clear that while this case

7

8

was being investigated, and it eventually led to

9

criminal indictment, a Justice attorney, a Department of.

10

Justice attorney who was in charge of the investigation

11

suggested that there be a Title 3 tap installed, that is

12

that the government go to a court and get a warrant.
When you look at the underlying papers that

13
14

were sent by FBI Director Hoover to Attorney General

15

Mitchell requesting the tap, what you find in a lot of

16

those papers are questions about legitimate political

17

activity.

18

Furthermore, and this is essential both to

19

that point and to the question of Title 3, the question

20

of whether there is a national security basis or not has

21

to be measured against the language in Title 3 which

22

requires at that point that the government was going to

23

claim a national security predicate, that they show that

24

there was a plot to overthrow the government or that

25

there was a clear and present danger to the existence of

Now, there is no possible evidence here of a

2
3

plot to overthrow the government, and the government

4

doesn't make that claim, nor is there any evidence of a

5

clear and present danger to government because the

6

government was well informed of everything the so-called

7

conspirators were planning to do by an informant.

8

They knew that if anything was going to

9

happen, it was not going to happen until six months

10

after they got their information.

They had the power of

11

indictment to prevent any action, and in fact three

12

months before any plans were supposed to come to

13

fruition, Director Hoover, in testimony before Congress

14

told the nation and it was over the front pages of all

15

the newspapers that we have uncovered this supposed

scheme

to blow up underground heating tunnels and to

In other words, there was under the statutory

language, and this is the point of Justice White’s

factual dispute as to whether this was a legitimate

23

national security tap or whether it was done under the

24

guise of national security to further a criminal

25

All of that certainly creates at a minimum a

So, we suggest when you look at this record,

2
3

and wa have tried to spell it out in our brief in brief,

4

there are substantial facts that make this a contested

5

issue.
The government's claim — I want to go back to

6
7

the Kenyata matter, because there the government, after

8

the Court of Appeals said clearly there is a factual

9

dispute, the government then petitioned for rehearing.

10

The Fifth Circuit has denied that petition for

11

rehearing, and the government has now asked time to

12

petition for certiorari.
Regardless of who is right in Kenyata, whether

13
14

the government is right as to whether there is no

15

factual dispute, or whether the Fifth Circuit is right

16

as to whether there is a factual dispute, that

17

demonstrates clearly that it is not very easy even after

18

a full review of the record by a Court of Appeals to

19

determine which issues are in dispute factually and

20

which are not, and if this Court signals by allowing

21

every qualified immunity claim to be appealed on an

22

interlocutory basis to civil defendants in these case

23

that they can delay trial, and this case has now been

24

delayed six years because of interlocutory appeals, by

25

merely

filing an appeal from the denial of the claim and

then having the Court of Appeals review the entire

2

record, hear briefs and arguments, you are going tc

3

create an enormous load on the Courts of Appeals.

4

The Third Circuit recognized that, the Fifth

5

Circuit recognized that, and in a very important

6

decision recently from the Seventh Circuit, Powers

question under the Cone doctrine.

Cone says you may not

allow interlocutory appeals if the issue to be appealed

is intertwined with the facts or the law of the case.

10

That is, it has to be completely collateral to the

11

merits of the case.

12

When you analyze a qualified immunity claim,

13

it is easy to see that the issue on qualified immunity

14

involves an analysis similar to the issue of whether a

15

right was violated in the first place, that is, the

16

merits of the claim.

17

You have to see what right is claimed by the

18

plaintiff, what acts are alleged by the plaintiff that

19

may result in a violation of that right, and then

20

examine the history of that right in the courts to

21

determine whether the law was clearly established.

Now, what the District Court then had to deal

1

with was the assertion that even though on the objective

record that was the purpose of the wiretap, they wanted

4

to go into a proceeding in which Attorney General

Mitchell would be cross examined on his subjective

motivation, that he himself was being governed by a

Now, I think the Harlow case stands for the

proposition that a mere allegation that a

condurt which on the objective record has substantial

support as a legitimate governmental position, that you

cannot in connection with qualified immunity go into the

Columbia, did hold in the Zweibaum litigation, which is

national security wiretaps out from Title 3, it

nevertheless equitable principles would compel the

8

conclusion that qualified immunity should be read into

9

the Title 3 case.

10

That is to say that a broader defense than

11

2520 ought to be accorded on equitable grounds because

12

the question of the applicability of Title 3 was itself

13

so highly uncertain and so conjectural.
