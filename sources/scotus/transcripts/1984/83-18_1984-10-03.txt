12

years ago this Court in Gertz versus Robert Welch, Inc.,

13

sought to answer.

15

and press protected by the First Amendment?

16

21

presumed or punitive damages and that the First

22

Amendment precludes such awards.

23

It recognized that the states have a

these twc

24

competing interests. It held that a private defamation

25

plaintiff who establishes liability under a less

3

1

demanding standard, that the New York Times test cf

2

actual malice may only recover damages which compensate

3

him for actual injury.
It is these constitutional rules prohibiting

4
5

awards of proved, presumed, and punitive damages absent

6

calculated falsehood that Petitioner Dun and Bradstreet

7

asks this Court to apply.
We believe that Gertz properly considered the

8
9

tension between First Amendment freedoms on the one hand

10

and reputational interest on the other.

11

Greenmoss Euilders nor the Vermont Supreme Court

12

advanced any reason whj the states have a greater

13

interest in awarding presumed and punitive damages

14

against a non-media defendant who speaks about business

15

matters or matters about the arts than a media speaker.
QUESTION:

16

Neither

I wonder if you would tell me your

17

definition cf the difference between media and

18

non-media.

19

20

person as an individua] is probably non-media.

21

is your definition cf non-media generally?

I can understand it clearly if a private

MR. GARRETT:

22

Your Honor,

But what

I think that is the

23

rub in this case when it comes to deciding

24

constitutional limitations on presumed and punitive

25

damages.

Obviously, the media could be defined as one

4

1

who uses a medium to communicate informat ion, and Dun

2

and Bradstreet, much like a newspaper, does that.

3

hire reporters to obtain information which cur

4

subscribers will want.
QUESTION:

5

New,

Ke

we have in Washington I don't

6

knew hew many, but I suppose it must be a great number

7

of letters, like The Kipplinger letter, that gees cut

8

every week cr periodically, sometimes on a broad range

9

of subjects, sometimes cn a limited subject like labor

10

law .

11

Is that media or non-media?

12

MR. GARRETT:

It seems to me, Your Honor,

13

wh'ile

The Kipplinger Letter, like Dun and

14

may not be considered the traditional media, it is

15

certainly media in that it is an organization that

16

communicates information to its readers which have a

17

reason to knew that.
QUESTION:

18
19

Bradstreet,

Is that issue before us, counsel?

You didn't bring that issue up here.
MR. GARRETT:

20

The media/nen-media issue?

That

21

is the very basis that the Vermont Supreme Court ruled

22

against Dun and Bradstreet in this case.
QUESTIONS

23
24
25

I know, but they held that you were

non-me dia .
MR. GARRETT:

They held -- they said --

QUESTION :

1

2

Did you challenge that in your

petition for certiorari?
MR. GARRETT:

3

Oh, absolutely. Your Honor.

4

Well,

we did net -- we have never taken the position,

5

Your Honor, that we were the traditional media.
QUESTION:

6
7

you are media?
MR. GARRETT:

8
9
10

Are you taking the position that

We certainly take the position

that we are media for the application of the Gertz rules
on presumed and punitive damages.
QUESTION:

11

Well, of course, your first

12

question presented in certiorari is, do the First ard

13

Fourteenth

14

plaintiffs to recover presumed compensatory damages or-

15

generally for libel against a nen-media defendant?

16

Amendments to the Constitution permit private

MR. GARRETT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

As

17

I said, we have never taken the position that Dun and

18

Bradstreet was part of the traditional media like the

19

New York Times or CES, but we certainly are media in the

20

sense that we communicate information to cur

21

subscribers.

22

QUESTION:

Yes, but the way you present the

23

case to us is that -- let's assume that this is a

24

non-media defendant, and then does Gertz apply to

25

non-media defendants.

That is the question you put to

6

1

US .

2

ME. GARRETT;

3

QUESTION ;

4

So we have to get into whether Eun

and Bradstreet is or isn't a media deferdart?

5

MR. GARRETT;

6

QUESTION;

7

Your Honor, I think it is --

You say we don't, really, in this

question.
KR . GARRETT;

8
9

That is correct --

Well, I think it is quite

correct that the constitutional prohibitions against

10

presumed and punitive damages don't depend on the nature

11

of the speaker or the subject matter of his speech.
QUESTION;

12

Right.

I thought you thought in

13

order to win your case you would have to convince us

14

that Gertz applies to non-media defendants generally,

15

and I

16

brief .
KR. GARRETT;

17
18

I think certainly that that

would win the case for us, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

19
20

think that is your whole argument, too, in your

Hew do we reach that question if we

don't knew what a non-media defendant is?
MR. GARRETT;

21

Well, I think that is the very

22

problem in the case. Your Honor, that it would force the

23

Court to go tack to basically the Eosentlccm ad hoc test

24

to make determinations on who is and who is not the

25

media,

and I think the most important thing is that the

7

1

rationale for the Gert? opinion simply does not depend

2

on those kinds of disticticns.
The states have no interest in awarding

3
4

presumed and punitive damages absent actual malice.

MB. GARRETT:

9

Against anyone.
Against anyone.

That is your argument, I think.
That is cur argument, tut I

would suggest to the Court that if the Court is

10

concerned that a media/non-media distinction should be

11

made in certain contexts, this is not the one to make it

12

in.

13

but not in connection with

14

punitive damages.

There may be areas where that would be appropriate,

QUESTION:

Bet I thought ycur position was and

16

is that it makes no difference who the defendant may be.

17

If you sued me for libel, for example,

the same in your view.

19

MR. GARRETT:

the rule would be

That is correct.

We dc net

20

believe that an individual could be awarded presumed

21

damages, because that simply is net preper fer the

22

states .

23

QUESTION:

Yes, right, and while we are

24

getting at definitions, how do you define the difference

25

between presumed and punitive damages?

8

ME. GARRETT:

Ycui Honor, in traditional libel

QUESTION:

11

If you went back to the common law

12

perception of presumed damages as being a

13

actual damages, would that make a difference in your

14

submis sicn ?
MR. GARRETT:

15

substitute for

No, Your Honor, because the only

16

rule we are asking for is that the jury not be told that

17

damages are presumed.

18

with the Gertz rule that says a defamation plaintiff may

19

recover all injuries -- excuse me, all damages for his

20

actual injury.

But even with respect to a

corporation, it could be a loss of reputation, as in

this case.

17

I say, there could be a less of a

18

corporation’s reputation.

19

the problem was a report of lankrupcty, which doesn’t do

20

a corporation very much good.

21

ME. GAEEETTs

In this case, for example,

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

22

distinction in this case, rather than proving a quantum

23

of damages, is proving a causal connection between the

24

fact that the report was issued and the individuals to

25

whom it was issued to took any action adverse to

Would you agree that any damages

Based on the evidence in the

lower court, or could be?

6

QUESTION;

Could be.

7

MR. GARRETT:

Oh, yes, I think damages could

8

be proved, but what the jury could not be told was

9

damages are presumed.

I think that is the single rule

10

that we ask this Court to apply, as well as the

11

prohibition against punitive damages.
QUESTION:

12

Do punitive damages serve the same

13

purpose as presumed damages?

14

like to know what you think .
QUESTION;

15

I assume not.

I would

Your Honor, traditionally punitive

16

damages have been used to deter conduct.

17

rationale behind them.

18

there is a difference between presumed and punitive

19

damages as far as their effect.
However,

20

That is the

I guess technically speaking

I think in the area of libel law,

21

they both have the same effect.

22

that you may presume damage, we believe that that -- by

23

the very nature of that charge you chill First Amendment

24

act ivi ty.

25

QUESTION;

When a jury is told

A punitive damage award is a

11

1

2

private fine.

Do you agree with that?

HR. GARRETT;

That's correct, Your Honor.

3

It’s a private fine unfortunately based on various state

4

standards which do not give juries much guidance.

5

we think in the area of libel law, the actual malice

6

test focuses on the conduct of the defendant at the time

7

he made the publication, and that is the correct test.

8
9

QUESTION;

?rd

Would your view, and this is the

last question I will ask you for a while,

I think, would

10

your view of punitive damages apply to a garden variety

11

tort case other than the tort of libel where

12

compensatory damages can be proved?

13

HR. GARRETT:

14

QUESTIONi

Well, Your Honor, T think --

That is net the question before

15

you, but I am interested in your perception of the

16

purpose and range of punitive damages.

17

HR. GARRETT:

Well, Your Honor,

I think as the

18

Court indicated in Smith versus Wade, punitiv-e damages

19

are a very troublesome area in the law.

20

reminded of what Justice Rhenquist wrote in that

21

decision from Oliver Wendell Holmes.

22

can tell the difference between accidentally kicked and

23

being stomped every day.

24
25

You know,

I am

You knew, a cog

Well, if you stomp somebody every day, you are
going to chill their activity,

12

and the real problem is

1

that punitive damages often chill beneficial conduct/

2

that they are too far ranging, and it is a very

3

difficult problem in tbe law, separate and apart frcn

4

the libel area, Your Honor.

It is a close question,

depending on the standards.

11

the case in the Eirst Amendment test of actual malice,

12

but when punitive damages, for example, can be given, as

13

they were in this case, Your Honor, for something called

14

reckless disregard of the interests of the plaintiff,

15

that is a fairly broad ranging -QUESTION;

16
17

Isn’t that language from New York

Times against Sullivan?

18

MR. GARRETT:

19

QUESTION!

20

I do not believe that is

I am sorry,

Your Honor?

Isn’t the reckless disregard from

Sullivan?
MR. GARRETT;

21

No, Your Honor.

The lower court

22

was reckless disregard for the interests of the

plaint iff.

QUESTION;

That language.

25

ME. GARRETT:

That language is --

2

3

something called reckless disregard for the interests of

We believe, Your Honor, that the facts cf this

5

case highlight the very concern that the Court

recognized in Gertz, presumed and punitive damages

4

What the Vermont Supreme Court did was focus

7

on the status of DKE or what it termed as a non-media

8

defendant and the content cf its message.

9

The Verircrt

10

justifies awards of presumed and punitive damages

11

against Dun and Bradstreet any more than against a small

12

newspaper or a lccal radio station.

13

The issue in this case, simply put, is this.

14

If the Eurlington Vermont publishes Greenness is

15

bankrupt, they are entitled to a constitutional

16

instruction that precludes the awards of presumed and

17

punitive damages, yet if Dun ar.d Pradstreet publishes

18

that same information to its subscribers because they

19

want to know, they are not entitled to that

20

constitutional protection.

21

QUESTION;

Are you entitled to an instruction

22

that nc damages can be awarded even if they are proved

23

unless — without proof cf fault?

24

EE. GARRETT;

Yes, we believe that we are

19

20

21

but could you compel a credit reporting agency to do

22

that?

Supposing there were

Would that be constitution?

MR. GARRETT;

Your Honor, I think the Miami

QUESTION:

16

MR. GARRETT;

I see differences,

"Your Hcncr

2

in connection with requiring credit reporting agencies,

3

for example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, from

4

requiring disclosures and from requiring identity cf

To me that is much different than a warning of

6

arguably a state and federal interest in the former, but

not the latter.

MR. GARRETT;

I think the difference in that,

is, you are not regulating the speech sc

23

the Court acknowledged that too often when we look at

on the one hand and the First Amendment on the other,

That's correct.

Are you saying then that damage or

ruining a reputation is not actual injury?
ME. GARRETT:

Your Honor, that certainly cculd

21

be actual injury, but in the business context that we

22

are in, it is nc different from proving damages for a

23

corporation, for breach of contract or any other thing.

24

You have to come into court with competent evidence.

25

QUESTION:

But Gertz says you don’t have tc

19

itemize dollar amounts, like pain and suffering,
medicals, and that sort of thing.

Sc, I mean, if you

are going to have damages to reputation, it is going to
be a lump sum type of thing that you can’t relate tc
dollar testimony, isn’t it?
NR. GARRETT;

That’s correct. Your Honor, lut

you still have tc prove a causal connection between the
publication cf defamatory words and the damage.
QUESTION;

Surely, but —

And that is what was lacking in

Well, it may be lacking in this

case, tut your suggestion that any award of $3.5 million
for damages to reputation must be punishment because it
couldn’t possibly have amounted to that much I would
think would depend very much on the facts ard
circumstances of each case.
NR. GARRETT;

Your Hcncr, I wculd agree with

you if no presumed damage charge is given, tut when the
jury is told damages are presumed, and then this Ccurt
or any court reviewing that has no idea what the jury
based it on, and that is the problem with the presumed
damage charge.

QUESTION^

13

No, Your Honor.

Hew does that go to the question

whether you need to prove actual injury?
MR. HEILMANN;

on the conduct of Dun and Bradstreet after the

As far as Dun and Bradstreet’s

argument, their initial question before the Court, I

think

23

proposition, and I don't think that they identify or

proposition that the common law of defamation doesn't

I am thinking

But you would have real problems

with quantifying the -- even if ycu -- ycu cculd prove

29

1

an injury, but to prove the extent of it would be

2

extremely difficult, I suppose, without the aid cf a

3

presum p tion.
HE. HEILHANN:

4

Well, I think so, Your Honor.

5

I think that is where the common law has its most

6

beneficial effects, because the intuition cf the common

7

law says that harm has occurred, and these presumptions

8

assist the private plaintiff in demonstrating and

9

getting to the jury the kind of harm.
QUESTION:

10

What is the presumption you contend

11

is appropriate?

12

Is there any presumption that concerns the amount cf

damages?

14

of damage?

15

Does it tell us the amount cf damages?

Or dees the presumption really go to the fact

HR. HEILHANN:

I

think the presumption gees to

the fact of damage, and not so much to the amount cf the

17

damage, and I really think the presumption —

18

QUESTION:

Sc that if you are able to prove

19

the fact cf damage independently, then you don’t need

the presumption.

QUESTION:

Doesn’t it depend —

22

HR. HEILHANN:

23

QUESTION:

Your honor, we --

Doesn’t it depend, counsel, on a

24

jury's evaluation of in effect punishment, how vicious,

25

how bad was the libel,

or hew mild and inconsequential

30

1

was it, and if they think it was very vicious and very

2

bad, they might give a large punitive damage, presumed

3

damage, cr if they thought it was casual and

4

inconsequential, they would give one dollar, as

5

sometimes happens.
NR. HEILHANNs

6

That may be so, Your Honor.

That is more in connection with the punitive damage than

presumed damage.

I would like to

The large part was therefore punitive, the deterrence

question that you posed.

You talk about the

Gertz doesn't talk about the presumption.

31

1

What Gertz talks about is the presumption of substantial

2

damages.

3

don’t think Gertz focused on all common law presumptions

4

in the defamation context.

There are many common law presumptions, and I

The common law presumption that I am focusing

5

6

on here is the presumption of causation, and I think

7

that is particularly important when a business libel is

8

concerned, because as Kr. Garrett pointed out, there is

9

a federal statute dealing with

the Consumer Credit

10

Reporting Act, but there is no federal or state statute

11

dealing with business credit reports.
Therefore, a bank, a creditor does not have to

12
13

talk with you about the reasons why your credit was

14

rejected.

15

testimony at the trial, the bank can simply say, we have

16

no obligation to speak with you about it.

17

The bank can simply say, and this was the

Therefore in business libel, it is very

18

difficult to prove these kinds of issues.

19

respect to Gertz, I think that what Dun and Eradstreet

20

is essentially focusing on in the Gertz case is, they

21

are trying to avail themselves of the strategic

22

protection aspect of Gertz.

23

Eut with

New, when I say strategic protection,

I mean

24

two things within the context of Gertz.

25

Gertz necessarily protects by way of the scope of the

32

Number Cne,

1

ruling all media speech irrespective of whether that

2

speech raises a public issue and irrespective of whether

3

the speech is of a general or public ccrcern.
The second part of the strategic protection of

Gertz is that it protects false speech sc that true

prophylatic rule.

Here,

Therefore it is a

the type of speech that

10

And on the type of speech, I would, withcut

11

trying to split hairs, I would like to go back to the

12

facts here a bit and point cut that we have talked about

13

"Greenmoss is bankrupt" as being the statement that was

14

made.

15

splitting hairs, is that "Greerircss filed for

16

bankru ptcy.”

17

The specific statement that was made, without

That is,

I submit, a purer statement of fact

18

than the statement "Greenmoss is bankrupt."

19

question before the Court is, what strategic protection

20

is necessary to protect business credit reports?

21

will there be ad hoc balancing if the distinction

22

created by the Court here is retained?

23

So, the

f r.d

I donv,t think there are valid fears of ad hoc

24

balancing along partisan lines by saying that an

25

admittedly non-media defendant should net receive full

33

1
2

First Amendment protection.
Dun and Eradstreet said, well, we circulated

3

information and therefore we are like the media.

4

other words, they claim they are closer to the line

5

between media and rcn-iredia than perhaps some ether

6

non-media defendants.

7

In

But in terms of the traditional First

8

Amendment values in defamation cases, they aren't closer

9

to the line.

They are among the farthest away from that

10

line, especially when you look at the rationale behind

11

Gertz and New York Times.

12

Fostering public debate, robust debate about

13

public issues.

14

that self-censorship is a valid and legitimate interest

15

when a company like Dun and Eradstreet is concerned.

16

SeIf-censorship.

I really don't think

In short, DDE would simply have you return the

17

Gertz decision to the ccnstitutional garage, excise all

18

reference in the majority and concurring opinions tc the

19

media and the press, and put forth a new, improved

20

model Gertz with full First Amendment protection for

21

every speaker and every form of speech, regardless of

22

that speaker's need for protection and regardless of the

23

significance or importance of the speech involved.

1584

24

It is the strategic protection area of Gertz

25

that Dun and Bradstreet's particular speech here falls

34

1

into,

and I

think the Ccurt should recognize that aspect

2

of the argument.
When Dun and Bradstreet tells you that it is

3
4

an unpopular speaker, what it says in its briefs is that

5

it is an unpopular speaker because it is an out-of-state

6

financial reporting company.
This is not the kind of unpopularity that the

7

8

Court sought to protect in Gertz, even assuming that

9

those features make Cur and Eradstreet unpopular, which

10

I don't think they necessarily do, and the civil rules

11

of procedures have avenues for avoiding that kind of

12

unpcpularity ,. to wit, removal.
QUESTION;

We asked for $7,500 compensator,

After discovery was over, we submitted a

request to the court tc amend that ad damnum to seek

6

$300,000 in damages, and as I have pointed out in the

7

appendix --

8

QUESTION:

Did they grant that or not?

9

MR. HEILMANN:

The court didn’t act on it,

10

because under the Vermont procedure, the ad damnum is a

11

totally irrelevant concept ether than establishing the

12

jurisdictional predicate.

That’s right.

I might point

20

cut that on that $300,000, many of the actions that we

21

say were outrageous conduct occurred after the complaint

22

was filed.

23

The main point that Dun and Bradstreet ignores

24

is that credit reports are fact-oriented, which contain

no opinion and no editorialization.

They are ret

But using the bread rules of general

application as the majority did in Gertz, there is a

very basic difference between media defendants and

defendants like Dun and Eradstreet.

to publish anything that might lead to a libel suit

8

other than with some media defendants a sense of

Therefore, when a media defendant is invcled,

Much to the contrary, Dun and Bradstreet has a

tremendous pecuniary interest in publishing this

material, this particular fact-based information.

11

all available to a defendant in a defamation case, and

12

Point Number Three, as I have talked about,

13
14

the causal link between demonstrated injury and a

15

defendant's acts may be one cf the most important

16

aspects cf the common law cf defamation, and I don’t

Gertz addresses that.
Fourth, where business libel is concerned, it

18
19

is very difficult tc lccate the persen whe actually made

20

the decision to withhold business credit, especially

21

where,

23

On punitive damages,

as I have said, in business credit contexts, the

D&B’s conduct, not its

24

publication, is what caused this punitive award, ard the

25

Vermont Supreme Court's decision recognized that.

40

As

1

D£E's

concession at the last oral argument demonstrates

2

punitive damages do deter.
They do work.

3

The punitive damages here were

4

focused on the flaws in the information-gathering system

5

that D£B has erected, and the gross and extreme

6

insensitivity and total lack of cooperation ly that

7

system

For example, Dun and Eradstreet refused for no

8
9

reason to give Greenmoss the names of the recipients of

10

the reports so it could help itself cure the

11

def amation.
The final reason

12

why Gertz should not le

13

expanded to this non-media defendant is that what

14

automatically flows from Dun and Bradstreet's position

15

is that the Gertz doctrine will apply irrespective of

16

the significance of the speech, sc no matter hew

17

trivii'l, unimportant, or meaningless the speech is, it

That makes the First Amendment apply to the

21

most trivial and meaningless speech imaginable while

of the First Amendment would be obliterated in

defamation cases because they wouldn't have relevance,

as would in the long run the positive, normative goals

MR. HEILMANNi

It is,

So there is no

I think so, Your Honor.

If you

16

accept Eun and Eradstreet's preposition that every

17

presumption at common law is defeated by the Gertz case,

18

a business libel plaintiff may have a very difficult

19

time ferreting out the kind of witnesses that will

20

establish the causation.■

Well,

That’s all this is

In this connection, the reasons that Dun and

22

should receive full First Amendment protection under the

23

Constitution can be utilized by the Court in deciding

24

whether to give this form cf speech First Amendment

25

protection under the commercial speech cases.

44

What functions do credit reports serve?

1

The

2

answer is,

they inform private economic decisions, just

3

like ads.

Credit reports don't affect public opinion,

4

fublications which inform and assist private economic

5

decisions have been held by this Court to constitute

6

commercial speech.
Credit reports have basic characteristics that

7

8

the Court has identified concerning commercial speech.

9

First of all, because of their factual nature, they are

10

easily verifiable.

Now, as we have heard, there is a

11

critical need for accuracy with credit reports.

12

That is also true with respect to the

13

commercial speech cases, where it is recognized that

14

such speech only assists the ccrsumer in making proper

15

economic decisions when it is true and not misleading.

16

Factual data, like the information here, can be tested

17

empirically and corrected to reflect the truth without

18

jeopardizing free dissemination of thought.
D£B has extensive knowledge of the business

19

20

credit market.

It is well situated to evaluate the

21

accuracy of its data.
Secondly, credit report speech is hardy and it

22
23

is durable.

Now, in an effort to avoid the application

24

of the commercial speech doctrine, Dun and Bradstreet

25

says,

if you are not talking about your own product or

45

1

servie e

you can't engage in commercial speech

That is

2

a futile dividing line, because it runs head-on into

3

comparative advertising theories.

The Bolger Yeungs Products case expressly

9
10

disclaims the suggestion that Dun and Bradstreet has

I think as a final point Dun and Bradstreet

12
13

says that you must look at the interest of the speaker,

14

the interest of the audience, and the interest of the

15

target of this speech.

16

this speaker and ask Dun and Bradstreet why strategic

17

protection should be afforded to this very durable, this

18

very hardy, and this easily verified speech.
