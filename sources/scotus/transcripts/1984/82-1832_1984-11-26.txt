Parker v. Prcwn exemption grounds.
There are three issues that are presented in

2
3

this case.

The threshold issue is what showing is

4

sufficient to establish that the sovereign State has

5

clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed the

6

State policy that the competition in question be

7

displaced with monopoly service or regulation.

8

If that requisite State policy is determined

9

to exist, the next issue is what showing is sufficient

10

to establish the State selected the City to implement

11

that State policy with the particular anticompetitive

12

conduct in question.

13

If these first two tests are met, the next

14

question is whether active State supervision is

15

necessary to assure the City's anticompetitive conduct

16

is attributable to the State.

17

The parties disagree on the showings under all

18

three issues.

19

and, I believe, determinative as to the first issue.

20

The Town's position that the requirement that the St ate

21

clearly articulate and affirmatively express its policy

22

decision to displace competition means just that.

23

However, the disagreement is fundamental

It means, number one, that the evidence of

24

that policy must be gleaned from the State's statutes.

25

It means, number two, that these statutes must clearly
