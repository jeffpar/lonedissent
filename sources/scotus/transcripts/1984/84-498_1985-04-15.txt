MR. LAUBER:

Sell, the question of who owns

2

the money in the ultimate sense is a matter cf state

law, and that would be determined after the levy in a

post-seizure hearing, either an administrative hearing

or a wrongful levy action.
QUESTION;

Are you saying that the ownership

MR. LAOBEPs

routinely used levies as the primary collection device

for many years, because it's always been the most

There is an administrative remedy?
Yes, there is.

In Section 63 —

By statute.

That was the

MR. LAUEER;

If they could prove that the

they would prevail on the wrongful levy action.

It's a provisional measure.

Ycu think the law permits you tc

MR. LAUBEPs

11

Well, this Court has said as

14

that property rights must yield provisionally to

QUESTION*

Just a little over half.
When ycu say the Government has the

that time and pay it into the treasury, so that the

winner in a wrongful levy action has to file a claim

against the Government, or does the Government actually

11

held the money in the bank?

MR. LAUBERi

12
13

Well, that is not inconceivable

to me.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LAUBEEs

Is that normal?
Eut the point is, if the third

party claimant comes in with a claim for the money and

17

can shew that this money didn’t belong to the taxpayer,

18

he will get the money back immediately, with interest if

And the other two had no rights

after that?
MR. WYNNE:

3

They would have the rights to

4

conversion anc their ownership rights under Arkansas

5

law, but they would not have any action against the bank

6

because the statute authorizes the bank to make the

7

payments and protects the tank if it dees.
Now, that of course is clearly — that

8
9

approach to the analysis cf the joint acccunt was

10

clearly set ferth by the Arkansas Supreme Court in Black

11

versus Black, where it determined that these joint

12

account statutes were passed for the bank's protection

13

and did not create any title or any ownership.

14

simple fact that Hr. Reeves is named on this joint

15

account under Arkansas law creates in him no property

That was the analysis that the Eighth Circuit

used in looking at whether there was a state-created

this Court, ard the Eighth Circuit correctly concluded

8

that there has been no establishment of any state

The Government has failed to provide us

10

enough evidence or information to determine whether

11

there exists any property or right to property, and

12

that’s their burden.

13

The Eighth Circuit then correctly found itself

14

to be in accord with Stock Yards Bank, which was a very

15

similar situation dealing with savings bonds instead cf

16

a joint tank account.

17

savings bonds were held in joint names cf husband and

But if a check came along signed by

Boy, is it, net for taxes but just drawing everything,

your bank would pay it out without any question as tc

whether Neva cr Ruby owned it?

That would be cur

13

Would it be any different if it was

a check payable to the IRS?

KR. WYNNE:

It'd make none at all.

QUESTION:

But you draw the distinction

between what the Chief Justice has just indicated and

the levy?
MR. WYNNE:

21

I do.

The IRS, while it may stand

22

in the shoes cf a tax debtor, is not the tax debtor.

23

And for purposes of Arkansas law we are only insulated

24

from any liability if we honor the request of a
