ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. CARROLL, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. CARROLL;

6
7

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;
The Petitioner in this case, Brian Keith

8
9

Hr. Carroll, I think

Baldwin, is an Alabama death row inmate who was tried,

10

convicted, and sentenced to death under the 1975 Alabama

11

death penalty law that was the subject of this Court's

12

opinion.

13

In Beck versus Alabama, this Court dealt with

14

what came to be known as the lesser included offense

15

provision, that is, the provision of this statute which

16

forbade the jury from returning a verdict which would

17

have comported with a lesser included offense.

18

are before this Court to discuss the sentencing

19

provisions of that particular statute.

20

Today we

By way of information, it would be helpful at

21

this point in time to review exactly what the statute

22

says on its face.

23

defendant is guilty of capital murder, under this

24

Alabama law is mandatorily required to sentence that

25

defendant to death.

A jury, upon deciding that a

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

There is a mistrial provision which the State

1

2

relied on in great measure to save the defect this Court

3

identified in Beck, which allows a jury that cannot

4

agree on a verdict of guilt to return a verdict of

5

mistrial, and also allows a jury who cannot agree on a

6

sentence of death to return a verdict of mistrial.
Once the jury has reached this decision that

7
8

the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a

9

defendant is guilty of capital murder, it mandatorily

10

sentences that defendant to death.

11

a sentencing hearing, wherein he decides what the

12

sentence ought to be.

13

requires the trial judge to weigh, along with the

14

aggravating and mitigating cire urnstanees, this

15

mandatorily imposed standardless jury sentence of death,

16

and therein Petitioner contends lies the constitutional

17

flaw with the Alabama sentencing scheme.
QUESTION*

18

The trial then holds

And the statute specifically

Mr. Carroll, has the scheme been

19

changed since that in effect at the time this all took

20

place ?

21

MR. CARROLL;

It has, Justice Blackmun.

The

22

scheme no longer exists and has not been utilized by the

23

State of Alabama since 1980.

24

this Court in Beck v. Alabama, the Supreme Court of

25

Alabama rewrote this law in a case called Beck versus

Following the decision of

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1
2

the State
Shat the rewritten law says is that there are

3

now lesser included offenses in capital trials under the

4

Beck procedure, that the sentencing authority is the

5

jury, that the jury hears evidence of aggravation and

6

mitigation separate and apart from its decision on the

7

issue of guilt.

8

And then, should the jury return a verdict of

9

death in a case, that verdict is then again reviewed by

10

the trial judge.

11

imprisonment without parole, that is the sentence which

12

is imposed.

13

If the jury returns a verdict of life

So the State of Alabama rewrote the procedure

14

to comport essentially with Georgia and Florida, and

15

then in 1981 the Alabama legislature enacted an entirely

16

new death penalty scheme, again which incorporated in

17

the main the procedures of Florida and Georgia.

18

the guilt-innocence determination is separate from the

19

punishment determination, and it is a statute in line

20

with the decisions of this Court.

21

QUESTION:

Let me back up a little bit.

22

the jury is considering the sentencing only, the

23

punishment, what are the options?

24
25

MR. CARROLL:

Again,

When

The options that the jury has

are, they may, if they find that a defendant is guilty

beyond a reasonable doubt of capital murder, then they

2

must mandatorily sentence the defendant to death.

3

QUESTION:

In a separate proceeding?

4

HR. CARROLL:

In the same proceeding, Mr.

5

Chief Justice.

6

7

sentence and guilt in the same proceeding, and that was

8

again cne of the defects that this Court identified in

9

Beck, although it did not specifically address the

10

Now we’re talking about the old law, the

constitutionality of that provision.
That provision has since been changed by both

11
12

the legislature and the Alabama Supreme Court to comport

13

with the decisions which require guilt, innocence, and

14

punishment to be determined in separate proceedings.

15

Mr. Justice Blackmun is exactly correct; this procedure

16

simply does not exist any more and has not been in

17

existence since December of 1980, when the Alabama

18

Supreme Court issued its opinion in Beck versus the

19

State.

20

So

The State’s response to what the Petitioner

21

contends is obvious unconstitutionality is in essence a

22

four-pronged argument.

23

the State tries to compare the sentencing process under

24

this statute with the sentencing processes under the

25

Georgia, Texas, and Florida schemes by saying, well, the

The first prong of the argument,

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

sentencing authority is required to weigh aggravating

2

and mitigating circumstances, the sentencing authority

3

is required to sentence to death if the aggravating

4

outweighs the mitigating.
All those things are true, but what that

5
6

argument ignores is, this is not the Georgia, Florida,

7

or Texas statute, because none of those statutes require

8

the sentencing judge, as part of the process for

9

determining whether a defendant lives or dies, to take

10

into account a standard less, unguidelined and arbitrary

11

jury sentence of death as a factor in making that life

12

or death decision.
So plainly the argument that this is similar

13
14

to other statutes fails, because it plainly is not.
QUESTION:

15

Well, the jury doesn't have any

16

standards to apply in imposing the death penalty.

18

you have no discretion whatsoever.

2

account the defendant’s race.

3

argument to its logical conclusion, all the State would

4

then have to do is come before this Court and say:

5

look, the trial judges in Alabama know that they really

6

shouldn’t take into account that race of the defendant/

7

so you should uphold that kind of a statute because they

8

really don’t follow the statute.

If you take the State’s

Hey,

9

The State’s argument is an invitation for this

10

Court to uphold the constitutionality of this statute on

11

the grounds that everybody ignores it.
QUESTION;

12

Hell, I think we all recognize that

13

it’s a most curious statute, the product of some

14

legislator's convoluted mind, I would think.
MB. CARROLL:

you call it curious, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

fact that there’s no indication that everybody ignores

1

circumstances
Another argument that the State presents with

2
3

this Court is an argument that there has been a

4

reinterpretation of this statute.

5

artfully, ten years after the statute was enacted, come

6

up with some reasons why this mandatory jury sentence cf

7

death, which is clearly aberrational, is in the

8

sentencing phase.

The State has

And it argues two points.

9

It says it serves a

10

function in that it conveys into the sentencing stage

11

the jury's fact-finding that an aggravating circumstance

12

exists; and it also says, the State, expresses

13

legislative policy that death is appropriate unless

14

there are mitigating circumstances to outweigh.

15

Well, the answer to that argument is plainly,

16

you don't need a mandatory jury sentence of death to do

17

that.

18

the sentencing stage the jury's fact finding that an

19

aggravating circumstance exists.

20

Under Alabama law, a finding of guilt conveys to

So this sentence of death exists over and

21

above that particular function,

and we can only assume

22

if the legislature put this in the statute that they

23

meant that it ought to have some effect.

24

necessary to do what the State says it does.

25

finding of guilt would do the same thing.

It's not

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

A simple

And that's exactly the way the statute

1
2

operates now.

A finding of guilt allows a death penalty

3

case to get into the sentencing phase, so that the jury

4

can then decide whether the punishment ought to be life

5

or death.
The second argument is the same, that it

6
7

expresses this legislative policy that death is the

8

appropriate punishment where an aggravating circumstance

9

exists, unless the trial judge finds the mitigating

10

circumstances outweigh it.

And again,

the mandatory

11

jury sentence of death is not necessary to perform that

12

function.

13

to perform any function under the statute,

14

assume that the legislature intended that the trial

15

judge do exactly what the statute requires him to do,

16

take into account the mandatory jury sentence of death.

Again, because that language is net necessary
we have to

Had the legislature not wanted the mandatory

17
18

statute — the mandatory death sentence to mean

19

something, they would not have included it in the

20

statute.

21

statute indicates that we cannot ignore the fact that it

22

is there.

And the fact that they included it in the

23

Again, it is the height of irony to say that

24

this Court should uphold the constitutionality of this

25

statute on the basis of the fact that everybody ignores

its existence

2

Finally, the Appellant -- I'm sorry.

3

the Respondent raises the issue concerning the appellate

4

review process under the statute and, coupled with that,

5

raises a harmless error kind of argument.

6

review process under this particular statute is, as the

7

State describes it, very elaborate.

exist.

11

It goes on in great detail about how the

12

appellate courts perform their function under this

13

statute.

14

verbiage, you come down to the hard, cold fact that the

15

Alabama appellate courts in their history in construing

16

not only this death penalty statute but the ones that

17

have come after it have set aside one death sentence

18

based on this independent weighing of aggravating and

19

mitigating, and that death sentence was imposed on a 20

20

year old retarded black man who was a non-trigger man in

21

the case, who had an IQ of 45.

22

But when you sift through all of this

I think the fact that he was sentenced to

23

death under this statute indicates how the statute

24

operates and the importance of the fact that the trial

25

judge takes into account this mandatory jury sentence of
12

death.

Again
QUESTIONS

Excuse me, counsel.

When you said

3

the appellant here was not the trigger man -- is that

4

what you said?

5

MR . CARROLLS

No.

If I did say tha t, Mr.
I was referrin g to the one

6

Chief Justice , I misspoke.

7

case that the Alabama appell ate courts hav e set aside

8

death sentence in, which is a case styled Lewis versus

9

the State, where the individual in that case I believe

10

11

was the non-trigger man and had an IQ of 45.
Again, though, the existence or non-existence

12

of an appellate weighing process is not the answer to

13

the constitutional dilemma that this particular statute

14

poses, because this is an unconstitutional sentencing

15

factor, and it is a sentencing factor upon which a

16

sentencing authority may not take evidence because of

17

its unconstitutionality.

18

Consequently, it is the kind of factor the

19

inclusion of which requires automatic reversal.

The

20

existence or non-existence of an independent appellate

21

weighing process cannot cure this kind of a

22

constitutional defect.

23

to the situation involving a defendant's race.

24

say again that if, instead of the requirement that the

25

trial judge take into account the mandatory jury

And again, if I could analogize

into account the fact that a defendant is black, clearly

3

this Ccurt would not say tha t the appellate weighing

4

process would cure that cons titutional defect and allow

5

that kind of a statute to be continued to be used by the

6

State of Alabama.

7

There's a final ar gument that the State makes,

8

and that argument's embodied in Appendix A of its brief,

9

where it lists the remaining persons in the State of

10

Alabama who are affected by that statute.

What it is is

11

an invitation to this Court to ignore this statute's

12

constitutionality because th e only left that are

13

affected by it are people wh o have committed seriously

14

bad crimes.
But that's not som ething that this Ccurt has

15

The fact that th ese people have committed

16

ever done.

17

serious crimes should not ov erride the fact that all of

18

these people have been sente need to death under a

19

process that is unconstituti onal , a process that is

20

fatally flawed by the very n ature of the Alabama death

21

penalty law.

22

Again, the State a sks you to ignore the

23

unconstitutionality of this statute because the

24

remaining individuals left w ho are affected by it are

25

people who have committed se rious crimes.

1

the time for rebuttal, we are not asking this Court to

3

tell Brian Keith Baldwin that he can go out on the

4

street again.

6

that if the State of Alabama wants to have a death

7

sentence imposed in Brian Keith Bladwin, that they do sc

8

in a manner that comports with the federal Constitution,

9

and that the present manner in which his death sentence

was obtained was pursuant to an unconstitutional state

11

statute which ought to be reversed.
QUESTIONS

12
13

But it is a two-step process, is it

not?
KB. CARROLL;

14
15

Mr.

16

is a factor included in the second step of the process

17

which is unconstitutional, therefore making the

18

sentencing scheme unconstitutional.

19
20
21

Chief Justice.

It is indeed a two-step process,

QUESTION;

Our argument is and was that there

You'd better give that to me again,

just to be sure I have it.
MR. CARROLL;

The statute requires the

22

sentencing judge to take into account the mandatory jury

23

sentence of death.

24
25

QUESTION;

That means he can accept it or

reject it, doesn't it?
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. CARROLL

1

But in the process of accepting

2

it, he is required, in order to impose a death sentence,

3

he is required to weigh the aggravating and the

4

mitigating circumstances, like every other statute in

5

the country.
But the Alabama statute includes a requirement

6
7

that he weigh the mandatory jury sentence of death,

8

which we contend is an unconstitutional factor.

9

the statute injects into the weighing process a factor

Hence,

10

that is unconstitutional, that has no place in it,

11

that's irrelevant, that's immaterial for sentencing; and

12

that that makes the statute unconstitutional .
QUESTION;

13

What if the statute provided that

14

the judge could ignore a jury recommendation of a life

15

sentence, rather than a death sentence?

16

that would be more unconstitutional than this one?

Would you think

17

MR. CARROLL;

18

upheld statutes similar to that.

19

aren't this statute.

20

The Florida statute doesn't require the judge to take

21

into account as part of his sentencing decision a

22

standardless — I'm sorry -- an unguidelined sentence of

23

death.

24
25

No, I think the Court's clearly

MR. CARROLL ;

Indeed he did, and as soon as

that word came out of my mouth I regretted it.
QUESTION;

Also, it seems to me that if the

4

jury is just automatically required to impose the death

5

sentence and the judge knows it, to tell him to take

6

into consideration that the jury imposed the death

7

sentence is like saying take into consideration the fact

8

that the jury found him guilty.

9

MR. CARROLL:

I think

that that line of

10

reasoning ignores two things;

both the flaws of the

11

mandatory sentencing scheme and also the fact that the

jury iray or may not return this mistrial, which is an

defendant offers nothing else.
Is it not true that the judge must then

3

sentence him to death?

4

MB. CARROLL;

The judge may conduct an

5

independent analysis into whether or not the aggravating

6

circumstances the jury found exist.

7

could find that the jury’s verdict of beyond a

8

reasonable doubt did not — that there was no

9

aggravating circumstance present.

10

So arguably he

So in those circum stances he would not be

11

required to sentence the defendant to death.

12

in order to sentence the defendant to death he must, as

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD EARL CARNES, ESQ.,

MR. CARNES:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

The issue in this case is whether this statute

statute as interpreted by my friend is constitutional or

6

whether the statute as this Court might have interpreted

7

it on initial review is constitutional, or even whether

8

the statute as written in its plain language is

9

constitutional.

The issue is not whether the

One of the most fundamental propositions of

10

11

this Court’s jurisprudence is it must take state

12

statutes as they have been interpreted by state courts,

13

and you held that in Proffitt v. Florida.

14

Jurek v. Texas is the best proof of that, because the

15

Texas statute as written did not provide for any

16

mitigating circumstances.

17

precluded that.

18

Criminal Appeals, interpreted mitigating circumstances

19

into the statute, and accordingly this Court upheld it.

20

The Alabama Supreme Court has not interpreted

21

the statute the way Mr. Carroll does, nor did the trial

court.

23

this statute, and it is not asking this court to set a

24

precedent that if everybody ignores a constitutional

defect it is okay.

Instead, the State is saying, as king this

Court to reaffirm its precedents that stat utes have t c

One of the most fundamental disa greemen ts tha

7

Mr. Carroll and I have is his statement th at unde r the

8

statute the jury mandatorily sentences the defend an t to

death.

The Alabama appellate courts have repeate dl Y

10

held that what the jury does is not senten ce the

11

defendant to death.
Of course,

12

the State has no guar rel with the

13

proposition that if the jury exercises sen tencing power

14

then it should be permitted to consider mi tigating

15

circumstances and should be given guidelin es .

16

17

because it has no sentencing power.

indictment with.

3

guilty, then it is true that, as a matter of law and

4

automatically, the jury must return a verdict form

5

containing formal language "fixing the punishment at

6

death."

7

If the jury finds the defendant

But every time the Alabama appellate courts

8

have looked at this procedure they have said, that’s not

9

a sentence, that is just a necessary consequence of the

10

guilt verdict, and what it means is that the jury has

11

found him guilty.

12

Mr. Carroll argues, and quite properly so,

13

that one of the most important things is how the trial

14

court interpreted the statute, because I will be candid

15

with this Courts

16

save one came out after the trial court acted in this.

17

But this Court need not speculate how the trial court

18

interpreted it, because the sentencing order the trial

19

court entered on page 18 of the joint appendix indicates

20

that the trial court, after finding the aggravating and

21

mitigating circumstances, the trial court said;

22

All the decisions we cite in our brief

"The court having considered the aggravating

23

circumstances and the mitigating circumstances, and

24

after weighing the aggravating and mitigating

25

circumstances, it is the judgment of the court that the
22

(202) 628-9300

1

aggravating circumstances far outweigh the mitigating

2

circumstances and that the death penalty as fixed by

3

this jury should be and is hereby accepted.”

4

As the Alabama Supreme Court explained in this

5

very case, saying that the death penalty as fixed by the

6

jury is hereby accepted or rejected if it's a life

7

without parole sentence, it simply necessarily follows

8

as a matter of form and as a matter of semantics from

9

the fact that the decision the judge enters either

10

agrees with or disagrees with the verdict form language,

11

not with any sentence imposed by the jury, because the

12

jury doesn’t impose one.

13

QUESTION*

Hay I ask this one question.

Your

14

brief's been very helpful in this case.

If the jury

15

finds that there was an aggravating circumstance -- in

16

this case I guess it was robbery, at least it was one of

17

them, in connection with the crime -- and therefore it

18

was appropriate to return, then they must return the

19

death sentence, then if the judge at the sentencing

20

hearing -- whether you call it a sentence or not, that’s

21

what the verdict form says.

22

But then the judge at the sentencing hearing,

23

first he has to find out whether there was in fact that

24

aggravating circumstance.

25

There’s no doubt about the fact robbery was present.

And say he finds it was.

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And then assume there's nothing else put into the record

2

except that finding.
Is it not true that on those circumstances as

3
4

a matter of law he must impose the death sentence?
FR . CARNES:

5

Jt depends on whether there is

6

any mitigating circumstance established either by the

7

evidence at the guilt stage or by the evidence at

8

sentence stage.

9

into mitigating circumstance at the guilt stage, but

10

Now, of course there is not an inquiry

sometimes it could come in anyway.
For example, if there was an insanity defense

11
12

and the defendant didn't quite make the insanity

13

defense, but showed he was emotionally disturbed at the

14

guilt stage, the judge could consider that as a

15

mitigating circumstance.
However, if there are no mitigating

16
17

circumstances, statutory or nonstatutory in the broadest

18

sense of the term, then the legislature has directed, in

19

part through this verdict form language, that the

20

sentence should be and must be death.
And that's one of the functions of the verdict

21
22

form.

It conveys from the legislature to the judge --

23

the jury is merely the messenger, merely performs a

24

ministerial duty -- that the penalty should be death if

25

the judge agrees there's a statutory aggravating

circumstance and if there are no mitigating

2

circumstances, which we see as substantively -- not

3

procedurally, but substantively — indistinguishable

4

from the Florida statute that this Court upheld in

5

Proffitt.
Indeed, Justice White's opinion points out in

6
7

Proffitt that the Florida statute had been interpreted

8

-- it must be accepted as interpreted -- as requiring a

9

death sentence if there was an aggravating circumstance

10

not outweighed by mitigating.

11

provision there.

12

statutes embody it.

That's not a unique

That substantive judgment,

15 state

And also, it really only makes common sense,

13
14

because an aggravating circumstance, as you all have

15

limited them in Zant v. Stephens, has to be something

16

that reasonably justifies the imposition of the death

17

sentence and sets this defendant apart from all of the

18

others.

19

If you've got that proven beyond a reasonable

20

doubt, the jury and the judge both agree that that was

21

proven, and there is no reason under Lockett, as broadly

22

applied in this asnd other cases, there is no reason not

to impose the death penalty --

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor.

returned a verdict form containing this language, that

12

was the end of the guilt stage, and that proved only

13

that the jury had found a serious aggravating

14

circumstance set out in the indictment beyond a

15

reasonable doubt.
The other function that the verdict form

16
17

serves is to convey -- and this is why the Alabama cases

18

say, they talk of it as an advisory fixing of the

19

penalty of death or an advisory indication -- it conveys

20

into the sentencing stage the fact that the jury has

found that aggravating circumstance, the definitional

HR. CARNES*

Yes.

Justice Jones of our State

6

Supreme Court, contrary to the other eight members, did

7

say that he thought that there was a danger that there

judge or could pressure the judge.
Of course, the majority answered that by

Also, that would assume that the public is

4

In any event, the majority of the Alabama

of Beck, there's only been one case where they ordered a

Both Alabama appellate courts expressly

that this system has operated in a rational bottom line

are some of the most heinous murderers, some of the most

whether the conviction was proper and whether the

By way of statistical analysis. Hr. Carnes has

relied in great measure on how this statute operates.

And he in his own brief in a footnote tells the Court

5

there were 65 people that were sentenced under this

statute.

So what Hr. Justice Stevens sail in Beck is

11

12

exactly correct, that this procedure that we have

13

created where the trial judge is required to take into

14

account the death sentence skews the death sentencing

15

process in favor of a death sentence.

16

I'm troubled very deeply by what I sense,

17

that, yes, this is a strange statute, yes, no other

We know that on its face this

statute says the jury must return a mandatory sentence

We further know that the jury has a mistrial

provision, so it doesn't really have to return a
