The Respondents would contend, in opposition

to Petitioner’s assertion, that the issue in this case

14

is not whether the time spent in the administrative

15

proceeding can he excluded, but whether Congress

16

intended to include within the purview of Section 1988 ,

17

intended to sanction an award of fees for optional state

administrative proceedings.
And we contend that when the language of the

23

are considered, that this Court should affirm the

has essentially advanced twc arguments in support cf his

2

proposition that fees are properly awardable for

3

optional state administrative proceedings under Section

4

1988.

5

what I call his reasonableness argument -- that he filed

6

an action in the federal court, he prevailed in

8

question left for resolution by the courts is whether

9

time was reasonably spent.

7

MR. HEADRICK:

8

And we think

They're net -- I see.
Yes, sir.
that the fact that the

administrative action is separate from the federal civil

10

rights action was recently noted and supported ty tils

11

Court's opinion in Burnett versus Grattan, where this

12

Court noted that the causes of action which Congress

13

created in the federal civil rights acts are independent

14

of ether legal or administrative relief which may le

15

otherwise available under state or federal law.

16

So therefore, we think that the Petitioner's

17

argument which seeks tc view this as one unit of

18

litigation ignores this fundamental distinction of

19

federal law.

20

Second and protally mere importantly,

21

Petitioner's argument jumps over the very statutory

and that statutory threshold issue is whether the

Nr. Ralston, let me ask you a

14

guestion on that point.

Supposing there is one day of

15

work in the state proceeding that clearly did not

16

facilitate anything in the federal proceeding.

17

you had to go in and get a continuance or some

18

stipulation about state procedure, but you spent six or

seven hours doing it.

QUESTION:

12

It's hard to get the flavor cf it,

13

but as I read the district court opinion I thought he

14

was treating the claim as though the lawyer whc was then

20

was arguing that all the time was reasonably spent and
