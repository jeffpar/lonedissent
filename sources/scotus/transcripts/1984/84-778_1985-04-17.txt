ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. CHASANOWi

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
The primary issue in this case is whether the
purchase of magazines in an adult bookstore by an

10

undercover vice squad officer can ever be an

11

unconstitutional seizure.

12

The facts are simple.

On Say 6th of 198 1/

13

Detective Ray Evans went to the Silver News 3ookstore#

14

an adult bookstore in Prince George's County, Maryland.

15

He browsed through the magazines and ha selected a

16

package of two cf them.

17

purchased them with a $50 bill whose serial number had

18

been recorded.

The exclusionary rule, which of course is a

15

judicially designed device, is intended to deter

16

unlawful police conduct by denying government the fruit

17

of its own unconstitutional behavior.

18

19

to punish the government for alleged illegal conduct by

excluding from evidence something that is not the fruit

21

of the alleged illegality.

The court has invalidated the conduct of an

officer who merely entered a bookstore open to the

public, browsed through magazines offered for sale,

6

selected a package of two of them, and bought them with

7

United States currency, all because it found that some

lat^r police conduct was unconstitutional.

against future things of this kind?

4

Is there any Maryland body of law at all on

5

whether they do impose their own remedies in these

6

situations?
MS. CFASANOW;

7

Maryland has not even fashioned

8

its own exclusionary rule under our Article 26 of the

9

Declaration of Rights.

We had a statute pre-Mapp that

10

dealt with an exclusionary rule for unlawful search and

11

seizure.

12

So our courts have never indicated a propensity toward

13

developing an exclusionary rule absent a command from

14

this Court under the federal Constitution.

15

is no indication that our court would do it independent

16

of the First and Fourth Amendments.

That has been repealed in the wake of Mapp.

this case arose as a result of police investigation in a

particular area of Maryland, Upper Karlboro-Prince

11

obscene material in what’s called adult bookstores.

12

Prior to the arrest in the situation involving the

14

it, situations where the police had allegedly made

purchases of what they felt was obscene material.

for or obtaining material that was obscene.

check and three days later the check had been returned

MR. SANDLER;

Then we might be involved in an

element of fraud, obtaining merchandise without the

intention of paying for it.

What

I*m suggesting to you, Mr. Chief Justice,

11

respectfully here is thisi

12

leading to this conduct that you refer to as a sale that

13

I think are important for the Court to consider in

14

reaching the finer conclusion as tos

15

we have an unconstitutional search here in violation of

16

certain precedents; and B, whether or not we have an

17

unconstitutional seizure here; and C, whether or not we

have an unconstitutional arrest in light of First

Amendment principles.

Well, if it was a legal sale do you

have any case?
MR. SANDLER;

I would think that if that was

23

the only factual situation that the Court had to reach

24

in coming to a conclusion, then obviously I would not

25

have a case.

2

Court and federal courts and state courts agree with the

3

proposition that there is a different procedure that

4

must be followed by states in attempting to regulate the

5

alleged distribution or sale of obscene material because

6

of the First Amendment intertwining with the Fourth

Amendmen t.
And because that procedure has been by court

decree, I respectfully suggest, then the state cannot

10

create their own procedures in .attempting to regulate

11

the distribution of obscene material.

12

that, they run counter to the precedents emanating from

this Court in order to preserve First Amendment

14

freedoms .

When they do

This case is a classical situation with facts

16

almost identical to the facts that occurred in Roaden

versus Kentucky, and in that case. Your Honor, the Court

18

did refer to the fact that the Court of Appeals of

19

Kentucky declined to specifically follow a decision of a

20

three-judge federal court in Ledesma versus Perez that

21

held unconstitutional warrantless arrests and

22

warrantless seizures of allegedly obscene material.

made i comment that I think -- and I say this

agrees -- we appreciate the rights of the states to

regulate the distribution of obscene material.

a procedure that focuses searchingly on the issue of

obscenity.

In other words, Roaden held that material such

And in order to evaporate or lift that

presumption of innocence of the individual,

be a judicial process, not an adversary hearing but an

where some boxes of allegedly obscene material were

shipped and reached a private party by mistake.

8

they opened it and found what they thought to be obscene

material and they called the FBI, but they had placed

the material that they saw back in the box before the

FBI got there.

And

When the FBI got there, they took the material

excludes the use of.
I am only. Your Honor, for the sake of

argument agreeing that the purchase was the vehicle

7

whereby the officer lawfully obtained the material.

8

Court of Special Appeals didn't feel that the purchase

9

was a purchase.

The

They felt it was constructive seizure.

10

For the purposes of the answering the question and only

11

for that purpose assuming for the sake of argument it

12

was legal.
But under the Walters theory, if the officers

13
14

got the material lawfully they didn't have the right, as

15

a result of Roaden and Heller, to screen it or view it

16

without taking it to a magistrate, neutral and detached ,

17

who could focus searchingly on the issue of obscenity,

18

make the probable cause determination, and then at that

19

point issue a warrant to either seize it and arrest the

20

violator.

21

I suggest, Your Honor, that in the case of

22

Roaden, when they referred to that three-judge court in

23

Ledesma versus Perez, that court recognized that

24

unlawful arrests and unlawful seizures without a warrant

25

in light of the First Amendment were unconstitutional.

They suggested

the distribution of obscene material, but that they

3

might have to incorporate in those regulations

provisions immunizing alleged violators for any criminal

5

conduct prior to a judicial determination ex parte, if

6

you will, by a neutral and detached judicial officer,

7

eroding or evaporating the presumption of protected

8

expression in light of that individual's conduct,

because it's his conduct that we're considering, not the

And if the magazine, under the theory of

12

Roaden, is presumptively protected and the setting in

13

which it's distributed is presumptively protected prior

to the erosion or evaporation by the judicial process,

15

how can his conduct constitutionally by operation of law

16

be criminal, and how can that give rise to probable

17

cause for a crime committed in the presence of a police

18

officer?

19

I would think, Your Honor, that to allow

20

police officers to make the initial determination that

21

material is outside the ambit of the First Amendment for

22

the purposes of either search, seizure or arrest places

23

a heavy burden on police officers who come from

That's why the courts have been consistent in requiring

2

the intervention of a neutral and detached judicial

3

officer to focus searchingly on the issue of obscenity

4

and provide the vehicle, the constitutional vehicle, for

5

the prosecution or the criminal process to begin.

6

Without that, to allow what happened in this

7

case under the rubric of a purchase, where you have 40

8

such situations, where the police officers had decided

9

with their superiors that they were going to send

10

someone in to Icok for material distasteful to them,

11

which is certainly contrary to the concept of Miller

12

versus California or Roth, which define the guidelines

13

that must be used in determining materials outside the

14

ambit of the First United States, if we allow this to

15

happen and if the Court of Special Appeals' opinion is

16

reversed, what will happen is that police officers of

17

varied tastes can go into department stores, pick up a

18

magazine, pick up a book, and in his opinion find it

19

distasteful to himself, make an arrest without a

20

warrant, close the store down, and make a seizure of the

21

material .

22

That hasn't existed in light of the First

Amendment, based on the precedents that are to date.
