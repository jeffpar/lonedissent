around the 300 associates who are pastors and

evangelists.

14

people who are actually involved as pastors and

evangelists in churches that are affiliated with a

There are many people that will be affected

Those that are directly

Well, are they engaged in the

production of goods, or are they engaged in evangelistic

MR. GEAN i

Your Honor,

religious.

purposes.

The District Court found that all of their
that these activities were

That’s what the District Court found.
And the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth

19

Circuit also found the same thing.

20

there is a difference in their opinion.

21

discrepancies in the opinion of both the courts because

22

of the- fact that they allege that the activities of

23

these people, these some 300 associates, pastors and

24

evangelists, are solely -- all of their activities are

25

solely for religious purposes.

Now, I think

(202) 628-9300

that the a ctivities are of such a nature that they are

commercial and therefore they should come within the

3

confines o f the Fair Labor Standards Act.

QUESTION!

Mr. Gean, does the Act apply to

5

other empl oyees of churches who are paid salaries?

Secretaria s or clerical employees?

MR. GEAN;

Is that what we

Your Honor, I believe that that

11

would be one of the aspects.

12

of great import, a nee to the Court, and I see it is

because of your questions, and I think it's an excellent

question.

In 1961, the Congress amended the Fair Labor

19

and hours protection to persons working in the ordinary

21

Now,

this was accomplished hy applying the Act

to an enterprise engaged in commerce, and then defining

an enterprise as "related activities performed for a

they are professionals or are they taxable?

15

MR. FRIED;

In 1968, the Act was extended

further to cover specifically schools and hospitals.

17

And Congress did in the debate indicate an assumption

18

that nuns would not be covered when they worked in the

NR. FRIED*

The Petitioners state, and for the

4

first time in their reply brief cite Section 512,

5

stating that this was determined to be unrelated

6

business income.

7

support that conclusion, and indeed the letter which

8

Petitioners cite in their Appendix says specifically --

9

and I refer to page 14 of that Appendix:

There is nothing in the record to

"Tn this

present or proposed activities are unrelated trade or

13

Now, we were quite disturbed to find this

14

reference to the Act in the reply brief for the first

15

16

first that they are unable to give us any information

17

regarding the specific tax status of the Petitioners,

So there was ample testimony in the record to

7

substantiate the court's finding that they contemplated

8

that they would be fed, clothed, and sheltered as a

9

result of their work at the Foundation's commercial

businesses, quid pro quo.

people were -- that's what they working in, a retail

then they would clearly be covered.

15

Now, petitioners do urge that the associates

16

17

devotion, and that they would have volunteered their

18

efforts even if they hadn't received these benefits.

19

And again, we don’t question that because that's not

MR. FRIED*

It’s a difficult question, and

16

what distinguishes it and distinguishes it most

importantly from the case we have here is that group

Your Ponor, but I think it’s very important to recognize

in this case that though Petitioners repeat that their

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

In fact,

1

the whole history of these acts is a history of various

2

arrangements sought to be designated cooperative, sought

3

to he designated independent contractors, and this Court

4

has consistently said that what controls is the economic

5

reality.

6

And here the court found as a fact that the

7

economic reality was one of a quid pro quo; that the

8

persons received shelter and housing -- and T quote

9

again -- "as a result of their work."

That finding was

10

confirmed by the Court of Appeals and, with respect, I

11

don't believe is a matter for review in this Court.

12

QUESTION*

Wait.

Does that f19 million figure

13

reflect the Secretary's computation of the number of

14

hours put in by these 300 that were not compensated as

15

required by the Act?

16

MR. FRIED*

That is a computation which is

17

still in dispute and is not final.

20

MR. FRIED;

Is it in the record here?

and is based on a computation by the Secretary which the

So that matter is still very open .

Mr. Fried, can I ask you -- do you

1

think the Portland Terminal case would have been decided

2

differently if the trainees were given room and board

3

during the week of training?

4

MR. FRIED;

I think that would not lead to a

5

different outcome necessarily, because of

6

which I have already quoted, "accepting the unchallenged

7

findings" -- I am quoting from the case here -- that the

8

railroads receive no immediate advantage from any work

9

done by the trainees."

the language

10

In this case, it can hardly be said that the

11

Foundation received no immediate benefit from the work

12

done by the associates of these businesss.

13

QUESTION;

But the benefit, if you accept your

14

opponent's view of the case, the benefit was entirely a

15

benefit to this religious mission that they carried out;

16

was it not?

17

testified -- and I understand you did not contradict his

18

testimony -- that the net result of all this was not any

19

profit, but whatever they earned they poured into their

20

religious mission.

21

I mean in the long run, because he

MR. FRIED;

We would vigorously contest the

22

conclusion that there was no profit here.

23

to be sure that the revenues, the profits from these

24

businesses went to no place else than the Foundation,

25

but that is not a test for profit.

Indeed,

To be sure,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

2

the Foundation could have been supported out of the

3

revenues from these businesses if they did not produce a

4

profit.

5

QUESTION*

Well, didn’t he testify the whole

6

enterprise was not profitable?

7

MR. FRIED*

8

He so testified, but he also

testified --

9

QUESTION*

Pnd you didn't contradict that with

10

any evidence, even though his records are available to

12

MR. FRIED*.

13

QUESTION*

14
15

Your Honor -Ps I understand the record.

So it

would only have to accept that testimony.
MR. FRIED*

The testimony I believe

16

contradicts itself because if what happens is the

17

non-commercial enterprises -- and they were extensive

18

supported in part from the revenues of the businesses,

19

then it must follow that the businesses produce

20

revenues, produce revenues in excess of their expenses,

21

because otherwise I fail to understand how they could

22

have served to support the non-commercial enterprises

23

which were, as we said, extensive.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

MR. GEANj

Your Honor, in my concluding

12

remarks in this last minute, I would like to point out

13

to the Court that this is a far-reaching matter that has

14

been presented to this particular Court.

15

The question is whether or not the state does

have a compelling interest to govern these activities

and to say these activities on the part of these pasters

and evangelists are such that they should be covered by

19

the Fair Labor Standards Act.

20

It is our position that if these activities

21

are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act and the

22

position that everybody knows, that these people are

23

going to take the money that they receive from the

24

Foundation and give it back to the Foundation, what is
