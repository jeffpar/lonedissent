MR. LEE:

Mr. Chief Justice,

may it please the

Court, the issues in this case which primarily arise

10

under the principles announced by this Court in United

11

States versus Ross are as fellows:

14

assuming there was such probable cause, whether the

police acted properly in searching without a search

17

bandaid box which was found, on the dashboard of the car.

The officer then returned to the car,

QUESTION:

13

Mr. Lee, may I ask -Yes, Your Honor.
-- what happened after the events

you have just described?
ME. LEE;

They stated that -- their testimony

14

was that when they -- after they found the money, the

15

items were taken inside the motel room, and it was in

16

the motel room that they found that -- they counted

17

$2,700 and found the methaguaalone.

QUESTION;

So they kept all the stuff

2

together, and took it down to the department at the time

3

they arrested then?

4

MR. LEE;

5

QUESTION;

I believe that is correct.
So at the time they made the

6

searches, would they have had sufficient probable cause

7

to dc all that without opening the suitcases?

MR. LEE;

QUESTION;

At the time they made the search?

MR. LEE;

MR. LEE;

Yes.
To arrest the defendants?
Yes.
I believe, based particularly on the

13

information given by the informant, and particularly

14

when Officer Taylor approached the car and detected the

15

odor of marijuana coming from the trunk of the car,

16

certainly they would have had probable cause to make an

arrest.

We contend that the search of the suitcases in

arrest under the doctrines of this Court in United State

8

versus Ecbinson and New York versus Belton.

9

It is the state's position that the officers

10

had probable cause to believe that the vehicle in

question contained contraband, and that a

12

entire vehicle for drugs was justified by the facts.

The Court in Johns stated also that the

5

officers in the Ross case had probable cause to search

6

the entire vehicle in that case.

7

that the facts in this case present an even more

8

compelling case involving probable cause.

9

The state believes

In this case, the convictions of the defendant

10

were reversed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals

11

in a twc-to-one decision.

12

why they reversed was because they felt like if an

17

located, the officer should get a search warrant.

18

However, if he only knows that there is contraband

search it without a warrant.

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

that when the officers detected the odor of marijuana

2

coming from the back of the trucks, they no doubt

3

suspected that the odor was coming from the packages

4

which were in the back of the truck, but the Court, of

5

course, in that case did not require a search warrant.

In Ross, the police were advised of the

the search of the

I don't think it is.

I am

QUESTION:

You think we should judge this case

12

then on the basis that there was no probable cause to

13

search the car other than the fact that these suitcases

14

were in the car?

15

MR. LEE:

Well, plus the odor of marijuana

16

coming from the trunk of the car,

17

the defendant Castleberry and the third party as the

18

officers approached the car.

QUESTION:

plus the actions of

I am saying that -- and I

Castleberry with a suitcase getting ready to get into

2

the car, I am saying that would probably fall more intc

3

the Place, and in your concurring opinion in the

4

Jacobson situation.

5

Here we have much more.

We have him putting

6

four suitcases in the car, one of which the informant

7

had specifically told him within the last ten hours he

8

had seen narcotics in the suitcase.

9

approaching the car, detecting a strong odor of

We have him

10

marijuana coming from the trunk, which I think puts it

11

right on point with the Johns case, where the officers

12

approached the trucks and detected the odor of

13

marijuana, and the Court in that case said there was

14

probable cause to search the entire trucks everywhere,

15

and the Court specifically stated that contraband could

16

have been concealed anywhere in the trucks.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

How much do you rely on the

resistance and flight of the people involved?
HR. LEE:

Certainly resistance generally

20

reflects a consciousness of guilt, and we think that the

21

actions of Castleberry -- we don't think a law abiding

22

citizen who was not doing anything would react this way

23

when he was approached by a police officer.

24
25

We think the fact that at gunpoint he refused
two commands to place his hands on the car, that he

obviously didn't want the police to get the bandaid box,

5

and he obviously didn't want them

that he locked the

slammed the door shut in the process of this, he

to get in the car.

6

He didn't want them to get in the trunk of the

7

car, too, because the actions of Castleberry in slamming

8

the trunk shut as he approached, as the officer

9

approached the car, should

10

also be considered, I think,

to be a probable cause fact.

11

So here we have much more than just an

12

individual who happens to be standing on a curb with a

13

suitcase next to a car.

14

which T think and which we contend

15

within the Johns situation.

16

QUESTION:

Here we have all

these facts

Do you think the officers had

probable cause to search the vehicle had the suitcases

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Johns case would allow them to search the entire

2

vehicle, because in that case all they had was a

3

situation 50 miles from the Mexican border where there

4

was a plane that landed, and trucks pull up to the

5

plane, and then as the officers approach the trucks,

6

they stated that they detected the odor of marijuana,

7

and then your holding in that case was that the officers

8

had probable cause to search.

9

packages in the back of the truck, but you stated all

10

these facts together said there was probable cause to

11

make a search.

Well, they also observed

12

So, I think, yes, the odor of marijuana is a

13

very critical fact, but in this case we have much mere

14

we feel like than the officers did in the Johns case.

QUESTIOF;

Mr. Lee, will you tell me once

again what you think you answered to Justice Stevens.
MR. LEEs

In response to his hypothetical, if

18

the police had had nothing more than if they had arrived

19

at that motel and seen Castleberry with the suitcases,

20

and he had not placed the suitcases in the car, and he

21

had not taken any evasive action, and they had not

22

detected the odor of marijuana coming from the trunk,

23

think this case would require them to get a search

warrant for the suitcase, just as though they are always

required to get a search warrant any time there is a

He

stated that he detected an odor of marijuana coming from

This was after the three suitcases had been

I think, it is particularly significant that

the officer did not mention any odor of marijuana until

QUESTION^

Even though -- do you agree that it

2

would be a reasonable inference to draw for the police

3

to think that this was going to be used to facilitate a

5

MR. COX;

10

QUESTION1:

No probable cause to believe that

the car would be part of the transferring, transporting
the drugs?

11

MR. COX;

Well, certainly if the container --

12

they have probable cause to believe a container contains

13

contraband, and that contraband, that container is then

14

placed in a vehicle, then the logical extension of that

15

is that if the vehicle moves, it is used to transport

16

the contraband.

17

I would agree with you.

QUESTIONS

Then what about the observation of

throwing a package into the car and locking the door?

13

What inference should the policeman draw from that?

14

MR. COX*

The only inference that I think can

15

be logically drawn from that is that the respondent was

16

displaying an increased expectation of privacy in that

17

container by further separating it from whoever this

person might have been.

9

The

I think the decision in Foss is perfectly

10

clear that if you have probable cause independently of

11

anything, any containers, to believe that an automobile,

12

not knowing whether it has any packages in it or net,

13

any containers in it or not, contains contraband, that

14

is the situation that Foss applies to,

The contrary is true, that if you have

knowledge of the suspected locus of contraband, that

20

the Fourth Amendment, the warrant clause of the United

States Constitution.

22

I don't think that the argument made in the

police are encouraged to share less of their probable

25

that if officers cannot be trusted to
