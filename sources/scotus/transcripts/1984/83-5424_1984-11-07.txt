Hr. Trctt, I think you

MR. SPITZER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
In this case, the State of Oklahoma convicted
an indigent defendant cf murder having refused his

10

request for expert psychiatric or psychological

11

assistance that was necessary for him to make any real

12

defense to the charges against him.

13

Additionally, the State requested and obtained

14

the daath penalty based in part on an expert prediction

15

of the defendant's future dangerousness, which the

16

defendant was unable to rebut because he cculd net

17

afford the same expert assistance.

18

The State tried this defendant in the face of

19

obvious and recognized indications that he may not have

20

been competent to stand trial.

21

We submit that the constitution, as a matter

22

of due process, equal protection, and the right to

23

effective assistance of cousel, requires the States to

24

provide indigent defendants with such necessary

25

a ss ist ar.ee .

1

Wculd ycu apply this rule ycu have

2

just asserted to every case, or capital cases, or tc

just the sentencing part of the capital case?

4

break it down at all?
KB. SPITZEB;

5

Well, Your Honor,

Dc ycu

what is before

6

the Court, of course, is a capital case and the Court

7

need not decide mere than is before it.

8

extent, which I think is a large extent, that these

9

questions go to the accuracy of the truth finding

But tc the

10

process at the trial, I think the logic would apply then

11

to ether cases as well as capital cases.
With respect to the sentencing proceeding, of

12
13

course, a capital sentencing proceeding is a

14

considerably different procedure than a sentencing

15

proceeding in a normal case, and there different

16

considerations might well apply.
QUESTION:

17

In other words, you might say that

18

even if it is not applicable to the criminal charges

19

generally, but it must be in the capital case.
MB. SPITZEB:

H c n cr .
As I will explain in more detail later, tc the

extent that this Ccurt applies a due process balancing

The second argument, or the second response,

I think it is the constitutional issue that

Your Honor, is that it would have been absolutely futile

10

to raise this in a motion for a new trial.

1

I thought in that case we held cn

something like futility grounds that there to the extent

that the Alabama rule -- that was Alabama -- requires

objection at each and every question in the suit, it is

5

totally inadequate tc bar a review of the Federal

question presented as to whether or not it was

inadequate State ground, and tc bar a review was a

8

question for us to decide.
MR. SFITZER;

9

QUESTION j

10

Thank you, sir.

I would have supposed you would

11

rely on it.

I thought that decision seems to foreclose

12

any argument that there was an inadequate State ground.
QUESTION;

13

That is a different argument than

14

you present.

You say that your submission is just

15

because the Court of Criminal Appeals discussed the

16

merits that there is jurisdiction here.
Suppose the Court of Criminal Appeals says; We

17
18

think

that there should have been an objection at trial,

19

or there should have been a motion for a new trial on

20

this ground and there was net, so it is barred, we

21

cannot reach it.
But in the event that the Supreme Court of the

22
23

United

States thinks that this is not an adequate State

24

ground, we are going to address the merits,” and they ao

25

ahead ar.d address the merits.

You wouldn't think that

they are addressing the merits, and then give us

QUESTION*

5

I could see that there would he a

6

question that would survive, the one that Justice

7

Brennan refers to, as tc whether that really an adequate

8

or an independent State ground, but that is not your

sub iris s icn .
MB. SFITZEBi

10

That question would certainly

11

survive, and I will be glad to adopt Justice Brennan’s

12

position on that question.

QUESTION;

But it is still alternate grounds.

It is still completely alternate grounds.
If a State court decides a question before it

21

where there is a claim of constitutional viclaticn cn

22

both State and Federal constitutional grounds, making

23

clear that they are both separate ones, we say that is

24

an adequate ground, even the Federal constitutional

25

issue is discussed at length.

HR. SPITZER;

1

Your Honor, I think I have cited

2

a couple of cases in my briefs where the court has ruled

3

that when the State did treat the Federal question on

4

the merits that was all that was necessary.

6

statement that we are also deciding this case on the

State constitutional grounds.

Your Honor, I guess I just don’t

alternate State ground.

Oklahoma law, and I believe that the issue is adequately

In that request did he also tender

the preposition that the court could designate the

MR. SPITZER;

an alternative.

He requested first funds tc retair a

suggested that the defense would be contend if the court

would appoint a neutral court psychiatrist.

any doubt that insanity was an issue and that such

The jury was then charged, in accordance with

Oklahoma law, that the defendant had the burden of proof

4

Is it part of your submission here that you,

5

ever in those circumstances, would have the right tc

have your own psychiatrist appointed?
MR. SPITZER;

7

I think the answer is, yes, but

8

the reasoning is different.

In those circumstances, it

9

may be that the defendant needs psychiatrist assistance

10

in order to rebut or cross-examine the State

14

MR. SPITZER;

15

Exactly so.

I think in this

case,

the answer is the same but for different reasons.

17

In this case, the defendant apparently needed that

18

assistance not to rebut the State's case but to shoulder

19

his burden.

is the same.

were to conclude that all that the Constitution requires

is some psychiatric examination where a defendant's

than that?
MR. SPITZER:

I really don't know that. Your

I think, though, that here the need is clearer

by a wide margin because there is no effective rebuttal

to expert opinion testimony, except expert opinion

MR. SPITZER:

18

Your Honor, certainly the

19

defendant could have tried

to cross-examine on this

20

question, but we don't require lawyers to be educated

21

about the internal disputes ameng the psychiatric

2

You say that you really can't

3

expect

a lawyer to be able to cross-examine an expert

4

witness without an expert witness of his own to suggest

5

questions?
MR. SPITZFR;

6

That's certainly not always

true, Ycur Honor.

It deperds, I think, on the nature of

Certainly, if one were to read

there is a good deal of psychological literature, and

psychiatric literature available on the issue.
MR. SPITZER;

13

That's true, Your Honor, and I

14

am not saying that that is not a theoretical

15

possibility.

16

Oklahoma pays defense counsel a very modest sum to

17

defend a first degree murder case and provides them with

18

none of the same assistance that it provides the State.

19

In these same kinds of cases, Oklahoma makes funds

20

available and makes experts available to the State.

But we have a situation here where

I think the real answer tc the question is,

the defendant was entitled to expert assistance to rebut

possible.

competency to stand trial.

He was receiving a large

amount cf Thorazine during his trial, and acting in a

5

way that certainly raised questions about his

competence.

I spoke tc the defense counsel,

of the record, but they said tc me that they did that

because they couldn’t talk

they couldn’t get from him what plea he wanted entered.

The law of Oklahoma on this question is quite

8

clear,

and I commend to you the Amicus filed by the

9

Oklahoma County Public Defenders, noting, for example,

10

the case of State against Davis, where the judge sent

11

the dafendant to the State hospital for an examination,

12

and the State hospital refused on the ground that the

13

State statute didn't authorize such an examination.

14

Similarly, in State versus Paris Johnson,

15

cited there, the court, feeling the l^th Amendment

16

applied to him, ordered a chemist be made available to

17

the defendant to test seme flood samples that were

18

crucial evidence in the case, and the Court Fund Beard,

19

which dispenses these funds, refused.

20

took a petition for mandamus to the Oklahoma Supreme

21

Court which denied mandamus, so the defendant never got

So whatever he may have said to the person in

ill.

14

illustrates the difficulty with relying on lay testimony

in a case like this.

to delve into the intricacies of mental illness and
