It was the first chance that

Edwards had come out in May of 1981.

The

11

Louisiana Supreme Court decision, on original hearing,

12

was issued in January of 1982; the rehearing in May of

13

1982.

14

The general rule concerning retroactivity of

15

intervening decisions is that when you're reviewing a

16

case on direct appeal, you apply the lav as it is at

17

that time.
The pattern in folio wing -- the law has net

Another concern that comes to mind if you do

MS. JACK;

10

Well, didn't we say in Solem that

You stated it was not a clear break

with the past, but that it was a new rule.

12

that interpretation is subject to discussion.

In that respect, it did create a new rule.
Prior to Edwards, it was unclear what, if any,

statements made after the person in custody invoked his

right to counsel would be admissible.

20

QUESTION*

Dc yon think that's a fair reading

cf the Court's opinion in Sclem v. Stumes, that it

withdrew Miranda or retracted a little bit?

7

I would have thought otherwise.

8

MS. JACK*

9

10

I believe that’s one cf the

interpretations available.
The third concern that the Court must consider

11

in deciding the rule of retroactivity is similar to the

12

one of treating litigants, dcing justice tc each cr the

13

merits cf his own pace, and that is treating similarly

14

sit ua ted Defendants alike.

15

Otherwise, you have the situation where the

16

17

gets the benefit, tut all the ethers who suffered the

18

same constitutional violation dc not get the benefit.

19

There are reasons for distinguishing between

cases that are on direct review and those that are on

21

collateral.

3

that you look to in deciding whether to overturn a

different, because you've act to have some point where

you can say it's over.

the only guidance you have is the law at that time.

Mr. Shea's conviction is still net final.

the reliance factor, and the impact on justice.
I submit that these factors truly come irtc

17

play only when the case is before the Court on

19

those factors were applied, each of these cases did come

20

before the Court on collateral review.

21

If you review the cases in which

These matters need to be considered because

So, in making that decision, you have to look

at these factors.

likewise mandate retroactive application of Edwards v.

Arizona to Hr. Shea’s case.

7

Even if those factors were to aptly

The purpose cf the rule, though in Sclem the

8

Court noted that it was primarily a prophylactic rule

9

and that prophylatic rules generally are not applied

10

retroactively, the rule of Peyton v. New York was

11

prophylactic.

12

Yet, that rule was applied retroactively to cases

13

pending on direct review in C.S. v. Johnson.

14

It was intended to deter pclice conduct.

Again, I note U.S. v. Johnson is the case in

15

which

Furthermore, in Solem, the Ccurt stated that the

17

integrity of the system and the truth finding process is

18

a critical consideration.

19

20

entirely unrelated as it is in Fourth Amendment

22

the Court adopted the Harlan approach.

Hell, they stated that the
