No,

I don't think we can assume

that the mark is descriptive, Your Honor.

There's only

Can we net approach this case under the

We would net concede that the mark is

matter, because our position is that under the clear

2

language of 1115(b) mere descriptiveness is net a

3

defense to incontestability.

4

And in leaking at the statutory language there

5

are, of course, many aids and guides that a court can

6

have in unraveling arcane cr ambiguous statutes.

7

there's a threshold question and that threshold question

8

is is the statute ambiguous, is it difficult to

9

unders tand.

But

And if it isn't then, as this Court observed

10

11

in the Fscondido case decided last term, statutory

12

language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.

13

Let's lock at this language.

14

"The registration shall be conclusive evidence of the

15

registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark,

16

except when" -- and then they list seven defenses,

17

Congress did, except when one of those defenses or

18

defects is appropriate.

19

The language states that:

The first phrase is "shall be conclusive

20

evidence."

It’s hard to imagine, at least for a person

21

who is used to trying lawsuits, anythirg clearer than

22

something that says "conclusive evidence,” because that

means to us that it is, the issue is concluded.

There

Vlhen the evidence becomes

It is intere sting to speculate also cn what

Congress did not say.

conclusive evidence only in a cancellation proceeding,

or exclusive or conclusive evidence only when a

defensive use was teing made.

They didn't say that this was

They also didn't say that it was prima facie

The next phrase, "exclusive right to use the

something that could be clearer.

means the right to use the mark to the exclusion cf the

Congress balanced the needs.

mistake.

And what I believe, Your Honor, is that
Yes, it is conceivable

Yes, it is conceivable that somebody situated

12

1

in lortland, Oregon, or in Ecise, Idaho, or somewhere

2

else will not come in contact with that mark during that

3

five years cf constant use, so that they won't raise the

4

q uestion.

5

But Congress in its wisdom said, this is a

6

scheme that we believe is appropriate, tecause the fact

7

that somebody doesn’t get to challenge that mark during

8

a period cf five years, that doesn't preclude them from

9

having the opportunity to compete.

11

They're free to

Just don't use that name.

12

and they don't identify themselves as Park

There are a multitude of names available.

14

consumer doesn't suffer, and the man who has invested

15

fcr five years in developing his mark krcws at that

16

period of time that there is some stability, that he is

17

not going to be confronted eternally with the same

18

def ense .

19

Now, in the final phrase of Section 1115(b) of

20

the statute the Congress says "except when one cf the

21

following defenses or defects is established," and they

22

list seven.

23

24
25

Cf course, one of those seven is not the

QUESTION:

Is it your position, Nr. Popkin,

that those are the only defenses that are ever

2

ME. EOFKIK:

That’s an exhaustive list?
Yes, Your Honor.

It’s precisely

5

what Congress said it to be.

But the

10

substantive trademark defenses are set forth in 1115(b),

And in using the language and in locking at the

It is guite clear from the context that what

23

Congress was anticipating was the use cf

24

incontestability in an infringement proceeding, and that

25

has to be an offensive use.

14

1

The interpretation espoused by the Ninth

2

Circuit and adopted ty the Respondent here must fail for

3

several reasons, that interpretation, i.e.,

4

is a dichotomy between offensive and defensive use cf

corners of the statute that suggests that or even hints

the logical situation.

The

inherent value in a mark is the ability that it has to
