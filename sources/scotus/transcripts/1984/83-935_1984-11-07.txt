that in fact Mr. Mills and Respondent Abel

10

arose, another tenet of which was tc deny the very

11

existence of that organization for the purpose of

12

enabling it to pursue its perjurious ideas.

13

After a long, complicated, and very

14

professionally held hearing, the judge decided that this

15

was proper evidence of bias; that it ought tc be used tc

16

impeach witness Mills; the balancing test of Pule hC3

17

was applied; the prosecutor was advised in his

18

impeachment not to use the term Aryan Brotherhood

19

because that term itself micht somehow prejudice the

20

inerests of Respondent; and the cross-examination and

21

the impeachment ensued.

22

Predictably, Mr. Mills denied the very

23

existence of the secret prison organization that he was

24

confronted with, and of course denied that he had any

25

knowledge that members cf this organization, which he

characteristics under the rule of relevancy that world

1

membership in that groip might provide a basis for lack

2

of partiality.

3

As I was indicating, usually this comes in the

4

form of circumstantial evidence.

5

membership in a family, membership in

6

any number of varieties, is usually regarded as a

7

sufficient basis for the inference cf lack cf

partiality.

QUESTION;

14

pros and the cons about the credibility of the person

Mr. Mills himself

So the context in which he

Ordinarily evidence like this requires an

23

that the member may be

24

therefore the inference that there’s possible bias is

25

proper.

A member of a group, you draw the inference
partial toward ether members, and

The interesting aspect of this case is that it
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

is not necessary to draw that inference.

2

It was admitted almost from the beginning in

3

this case that it would be proper to show that the

4

witness and the Respondent were members of the same

5

grcup.

6

to infer that they might be partial towards each other,

7

and therefore bias might exist.

And I suppose that it would therefore be proper

8
9

The confusing part of this case is that the
agreement is that it is all right to speculate on

10

whether cr ret the bias exists, tut somehow it is ret

11

all right to be able to prove that by direct evidence

12

that these people have somehow agreed that they will go

13

into court ana commit perjury.

14

So the problem with this evidence is, in one

15

strange way of characterizing it,

16

We allow a jury to speculate that members of a law firm

17

might be biased towards each other because of a

18

financial interest in testifying in court.

19

jury to speculate that members of a family may be biased

20

against each other.

21

it is toe probative.

We allow a

But when we come to a group like this, somehow

22

we row find out that net only we would allow that

23

speculation, but we will not allow proof of the fact.

I see that as a term of art, basically,
