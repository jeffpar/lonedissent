The fifth fact is that in

more meaningful payment was in order, and it increased

11

The GAO report, which is in

freight-only railroads and

that arranged for their employees to have pass

privileges on passenger trains.

employees is a part of the provision of the total

why then does not the plain language of the agreement

and as of about two years ago the last carrier that had

issue in this case, which is whether the railroads have

11

any contractual rights whatsoever against the United

12

13

The railroads' position is that the Rail

14

Passenger Service Act, the RPSA, gave them the

15

contractual right to be forever free from all passenger

service obligations, while at the same time allowing

17

them to retain their freight lines.

But before addressing those three -- those

22

four points, I would like to mention several facts that

23

we believe are quite important and were omitted or

24

inappropriately emphasized in the arguments of Amtrak.

25

First of all, when the railroads themselves had

Furthermore, whenever the railroads did

will show that between the 1920's and

1970 the number of

500.

Whenever the railroads did discontinue a passenger

2

"entire responsibility" in the contract it didn't mean

3

just those responsibilities that were in existence in

4

197 1.

5

As I'm about to discuss in a moment, the

6

purpose of the Rail Passenger Service Act was to get the

7

railroads out of a situation of crippling passenger

8

service losses that threatened their freight service.

9

And Congress' intent was to relieve them from that

10

financial responsibility, and the words "entire

11

responsibility" surely must refer to more than just the

12

responsibilities they had in 1971, but to any subsequent

13

responsibility that Congress might attempt to impose

14

that would in effect restore these uncompensated costs.
