Hr. Frohnmayer, is there anything

to establish whether that Claims Commission considered

the value of the tribal hunting and fishing rights when

25

it made its award?

1

MR. FROHNMAYERi

In the Claims Commission,

2

counsel for both parties agreed that they should be

3

compensated at fair market value and at the highest and

4

best use.

5

Commissions that the highest and best use was for timber

6

and grazing, and that was the basis of the

7

compen sation.

8
9

It was agreed by the parties in those Claims

The 1906 agreement which ratified the -- the
1096 cession Act which ratified the bilateral agreement

10

provided in Article 1,

11

important, that the Klamath Indians do "hereby cede,

12

surrender,

13

their claim, right, title, and interest in and to the

14

erroenously surveyed lands.

15

grant,

and this language is particularly

and convey to the United States" all

In its recitation of consideration,

Article 2

16

of that same cession act provided that this was

17

satisfaction "in full of all claims and demands of said

18

Klamath or other Indians arising or growing out of the

19

erroneous survey."

20

No express reservation was made in this 1906

21

Act for any residual hunting, fishing, or gathering

22

rights on the ceded lands or indeed on any

23

off-reservation areas.

1

The parties stipulated that the Indians

2

continued to hunt, fish, and trap on the excluded lands

3

without regard to state regulation, but also that they

4

were unaware of any denial by the tribe that the state

5

lacked this regulatory power, at least until proceedings

6

were instituted in the instant case.

7

QUESTION;

I am a little curious as to what

8

that stipulation reflects.

The state of Oregon didn't

9

try to regulate the Indians in the national forest when

10

they fished, or they thought they were regulating, but

11

the Indians thought they weren't?

12

k HR. FROHNMAYER:

The latter construction is

13

probably correct, and of course the state was a stranger

14

to the agreement between the United States government

15

and the tribes.

16

The state has its regulatory authority by

17

virtue of the joint agreement with the federal

18

government which ordinarily asks states to manage lands

19

and manage wildlife within the national forests in their

20

bounda ries.

21

And, of course, enforcement of game and

22

fishing laws are a discretionary matter with the states,

although we need to go somewhat beyond the record to

amplify it.

MR. FROHNMAYERi

The record is silent on that

So really what was happening here,

they just weren’t enforcing those against the Indians.

were in the diminished area or in the area that

MR. FROHNMAYER:

That is correct.

That is the

11

argument, and that is an argument which would follow

12

from my ambiguous language of sale and cession where in

13

the first instance the fishing right is defined by the

14

terms of the treaty as being within the reservation

15

bound a ries.

So you say that the Indian Claims

13

MR. FROHNMAYER;

The Indian Claims Commission

14

bears only on the adequacy of the compensation that was

given for the cession.

occupy the land or the fact that the treaty confers tne

right to fish, gather, and hunt within its limits.

MR. FROHNMAYEB:

14

Briefly,

15
16

Thank you, Mr.

six points,

Chief Justice.

which I believe will not

require all the time that I have reserved.
First,

I must respectfully submit that

17

opposing counsel has done in oral argument precisely

18

what he has done in the briefs, and that is to confuse

19

the language of Article 4,

20

purposes of the cession agreement.

21

provisions of the agreement.

22

speak for themselves,

23

of the parties or the Congress which enacted it.

24
25

which does not speak to
It talks about

Provisions are clear, and

and do not require psychoanalysis

The second point is that we have referred in
our opening argument to the anomaly created by the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

49

1

special situation of Crater Lake National Park, the

2

largest part of the western cession boundaries.

3

Federal law has since time immemorial, at

4

least since the creation of the park, prohibited hunting

5

altogether on that piece of ceded property, and yet it

6

is anomalous because the right asserted is the right of

7

subsistence to hunt and fish and the allegedly onerous

8

nature of state regulations, which simply have baa

9

limits and season limits.

10

The federal government with respect to its

11

share of those lands in the national park prohibits

12

hunting altogether, and yet no mention of how this is to

13

be reconciled with the theoretical position of the tribe

14

has yet been offered by our opponents.

15

That leads to the point that we have heard no

16

argument about the source of this asserted right.

17

source can only come from one of four sources:

18

aboriginal right, the treaty right of 1864, the 1906

19

cession agreement, or some other contemporaneous Set of

20

Congress which regranted to the tribe the authority to

21

hunt and fish as it had before on the ceded land, and in

22

fact none of those first three sources is conceivably

23

the source,

24
25

That

and therefore we must look to the fourth.

Justice Stevens asked our worthy opponents for
authority for their proposition, a point, I believe.
