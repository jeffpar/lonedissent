ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHRYN MARIE KRAUSE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MS. KRAUSE:

7

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
For over 50 years Section 17 of the Pueblo Lands

9
10

Act was considered to authorize the public conveyance of

11

a right-of-way across their lands, provided only that that

12

conveyance was approved by the Secretary of the Interior.

13

No further congressional authorization or legislation was

14

deemed necessary.

Section 17 and it was an interpretation that was put into

17

practice and concurred in by the Pueblos.

18

That was the interpretation of the
It was based on the language of

The Department of Interior practice resulted in

19

over 60 grants of rights-of-way across the lands of the

20

Pueblos in the State of New Mexico and spanned a period

21

of time of over 30 years.

1

Prior to 1928, in the fall of 1927, Mountain Bell

2

was named in a quiet title action that had been brought

3

under Section 3 of the Pueblo Lands Act.

4

styled United States of America as guardian for the Pueblo

5

of Santa Ana versus Charles Brown.

6

That action was

The complaint alleged that the Defendants held

7

right titles and interests to the lands of the Pueblos or

8

at least claimed such interest and asked that those interests

9

be declared null and void.

10

The complaint also alleged that the Defendants

11

were trespassing across the property of the Pueblo and asked

12

that the trespass be enjoined by an injuction.

13

Mountain Bell was dismissed from that lawsuit.

14

It secured a right-of-way from the Pueblo in February of

15

1928 and within six weeks the legal representative represent­

16

ing the Pueblos moved to dismissed Mountain Bell from the

17

Brown action on the grounds that since the institution of

18

the suit Mountain Bell had secured good and sufficient title

19

to its right-of-way over the premises and controversy under

20

Section 17 of the Pueblo Lands Act.

21

22

25

The order of dismissal by the District Court Judge
recited substantially similar statements.
In 1980, the Pueblo of Santa Ana sued Mountain
Bell again.

Ms. Krause, am I correct, however,

6

no answer was ever filed in that suit?
MS. KRAUSE:

You are right, Justice Blackmun,

there was no answer filed.
In 1980, the Pueblo again sued Mountain Bell,
arguing that Mountain Bell was in trespass.
QUESTION:

Before you leave your earlier suit,

7

may I just ask this question about it?

8

that suit adjudicated the right of Mountain Bell at the

9

time the suit was filed or at the time the suit was dismissed?

10

MS. KRAUSE:

11

QUESTION:

Do you contend that

I am sorry, Justice Stevens -In other words, you claim that was

12

an adjudication that Mountain Bell had previously acquired

13

the right-of-way or that it was an adjudication that the

14

conveyance that was approved by the Secretary of Interior

15

was a valid conveyance?

16

on res judicata.

17

MS. KRAUSE:

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. KRAUSE:

What did they decide?

You rely

That is right.
What is it that you say they decided?
I think the order was a final judgment

20

on the merits to the effect that Mountain Bell had good

21

title to its right-of-way.

22

I think the Pueblos had the opportunity through

23

their legal counsel if they wanted to litigate the question

24

of whether Mountain Bell had legal title or had been in

25

trespass prior to the time of that order to have litigated

it but they did not.
QUESTION:

2

Then you are saying that that adjudica­

3

tion was to the effect that Mountain Bell had good titles

4

before the lawsuit was filed?

5

6

MS. KRAUSE:
May 31, 1928.

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. KRAUSE:

9

Well, the order is dated, I think,

I understand that, but -And it does not address whether it

is speaking about before or after.

10

QUESTION:

I understand that.

I am just trying

11

to understand what your theory is of what it was that the

12

court adjudicated.

13

MS. KRAUSE:

I think the court adjudicated the

14

fact that Mountain Bell had good title as of that date for

15

certain and did not actually address whether it had it before

16

or not.

17

precluded probably from raising whether we had it before

18

or not because they had a full and fair opportunity to

19

litigate that question at the time.

20

I think our argument would be that the Pueblo is

QUESTION:

I am still not sure I understand your

21

position.

22

the 1928 conveyance was a valid conveyance or an adjudication

23

that they previously had good title?

24

what you are saying.

25

You say then that it was an adjudication that

MS. KRAUSE:

Okay.

I just don't know

Let me back up a minute.
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 E ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

1

I know you say that it means as of

2

the date of the entry of the order they owned the property.

3

I am just trying to figure out on which of two alternative

4

theories do you think that the judgment rests?
MS. KRAUSE:

5

I think the judgment rests on the

6

fact that we had secured a valid right-of-way from Pueblo

7

of Santa Ana that was approved by the Secretary.

8

if I am being obtuse.

9

exactly.
QUESTION:

10

I am sorry

I don't think I understand the question

Well, let me try and rephrase it.

11

There are two theories on which you could have acquire title

12

at the date that order was entered.

13

MS. KRAUSE:

14

QUESTION:

15

Right.
One was that you got it back in 1905

or whatever the date of your original position.

16

MS. KRAUSE:

17

QUESTION:

Right.
The second theory was that after the

18

lawsuit was filed the Secretary approved the conveyance

19

to you.

20

I am asking you which do you think supports the order.

21

One of those two theories must support the order.

MS. KRAUSE:

I think the theory that we had acquired

22

the right-of-way as of 1928 supports the order.

23

that an argument could be made, however —

24
25

QUESTION:

I think

So you are saying that this was an

adjudication not of any issue tendered by the complaint,
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

rather of the validity of the post-complaint conveyance?

2

MS. KRAUSE:

3

QUESTION:

4

Well —
That is what I understand you to be

saying.
MS. KRAUSE:

5

I think that the principles of res

6

judicata support that it bars something that could have

7

been litigated as well as those things that were litigated.

8

And so to the extent that the order on its face states that

9

Mountain Bell has a good and sufficient right-of-way and

10

has perfected title to a right-of-way, that it actually

11

is an adjudication as to Mountain Bell's status as of that

12

time which covers Mountain Bell's status back to 1904 frankly.

13

It could have been litigated at that point in time and it

14

was not.

15

QUESTION:

Thank you.

16

MS. KRAUSE:

The Pueblo in 1980 reputed its

17

right-of-way grant to Mountain Bell arguing that the second

18

clause of Section 17 did not authorize it to grant a

19

conveyance to Mountain Bell, and that, in fact, that statute

20

prohibited any such conduct on their part.

21

They renounced the actions of their legal repre­

22

sentatives in the Brown lawsuit on the grounds that the

23

order of dismissal was intended to be a procedural order

24

only and not to be a final judgment on the merits and that

25

the order by the trial court judge did not rise to the dignity
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of the type of order that should be accorded res judicata

2

effect.
The Tenth Circuit agreed with the Pueblo on both

3
4

issues.

5

did not authorize the Pueblo to convey their property and

6

that the Pueblo would not be authorized to have granted

7

the right-of-way until some Congress other than the 68th

8

Congress took some action to authorize the Pueblo to convey

9

their property.

It held that Section 17 of the Pueblo Lands Act

The Court also held the Pueblo was not barred

10

11

from the order of dismissal, from relitigating something

12

it had a full and fair opportunity to litigate in 1928,

13

the status of Mountain Bell as a trespasser across their

14

lands.

15

The Tenth Circuit opinion is clearly erroneous

16

for three reasons:

17

to a reasonable administrative interpretation of Section

18

17 that is almost compelled by the statutory language found

19

in that section.

20
21

First, that opinion failed to defer

QUESTION:

Judge Breitenstein thought the statute

was clear as a bell, clear as Mountain Bell.

22

MS. KRAUSE:

23

The Tenth Circuit held that Section 17 means

Clear as Mountain Bell.

24

exactly what is says.

25

think, does a very nice job of explaining the particular

The United States amicus brief, I

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

problems with that theory.

2

no conveyance of Pueblo lands would be valid until Congress

3

hereinafter provided and the problem with that analysis

4

is that the first clause of Section 17 does not make any

5

reference to conveyances of Pueblo lands, only the second

6

clause of Section 17 does.

7

The Tenth Circuit stated that

And, along the lines Justice White has just

8

suggested, the Tenth Circuit reading of the language of

9

Section 17 seems superficial at best.

It does not take

10

into account the distinctly different types of language

11

used in the first and second clauses.

12

to Congress a most bizzare intention, the intention of

13

enacting a statute of which the second clause was totally

14

inoperative at the time it was passed.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

It results in imputing

Ms. Krause, I guess your interpretation

really makes Section 16 of the Act superfluous, doen't it?
MS. KRAUSE:

Not at all, Your Honor.

Section

18

16 of the Act is an integral part of the procedure involving

19

the Pueblo Lands Act and how that procedure was going to

20

be administered and carried out through the fruition of

21

the process.

22

That section --

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Well, suppose if 17 means what you

say it means, then Section 16 was not needed -MS. KRAUSE:

Well —
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

1

— because the Pueblo, with the consent

2

of the Secretary, could have disposed of lands that otherwise

3

would have been disposed of under Section 16 possibly.

4

MS. KRAUSE:

That is possible, but Section 16

5

has responsibilities that are imposed on the Secretary of

6

the Interior that are not imposed on him under Section 17.

7

Under Section 16, as originally drafted, and I will also

8

explain the amendment, if a claimant before the Lands Board

9

was not successful and lost his property so that this piece

10

of property here was now Pueblo property, the title to which

11

had not been extinguished, and all the land surrounding

12

that property were in non-Indians, then the Secretary was

13

supposed to put that piece of property up for bid to the

14

highest bidder for cash.

15

was to --

16

QUESTION:

After he received that cash, he

Well, wait.

I think we understand,

17

but if 17 means what you say it means, that wouldn't have

18

to be done at all.

19

indeed, I guess there are some indications that 17 was used

20

instead of 16.

21

They could have used Section 17 and,

MS. KRAUSE:

Well, they couldn't have used Section

22

17 if they wanted the Secretary to make distinctions between

23

the claimant who bought the property and the claimant who

24

lost the property and they couldn't have used Section 17

25

if they wanted the Secretary to credit when it was the
11

(202) 628-9300

1

claimant who bought the property and to disburse funds for

2

improvements when it was the claimant who didn't purchase

3

it.
QUESTION:

4
5

Do you know whether Section 16 was

ever used?
MS. KRAUSE:

6

I do not know if it was used.

I

7

know it was amended in 1933 so that the Secretary could

8

put lands out for bid, still within the confines of the

9

Pueblo Lands Act legislation and still within the confines

10

of the adjudications that were going on in that Act, so

11

that the land no longer had to be surrounded by non-Indian

12

land.

13

amended, I guess I would make the assumption that it was

14

probably used.

15

And, because of the fact that it was specifically

The Tenth Circuit's interpretation, as I mentioned,

16

ignored a reasonable administrative interpretation of

17

Section 17 that was almost compelled by the language of

18

the statute and it gave no weight to the administrative

19

practice that grew up around that interpretation, a practice

20

that was concurred in by the Pueblos themselves and by their

21

legal representatives.

22

In so doing the Tenth Circuit failed to follow

23

this Court's admonition in a long line of cases which

24

culminated only last term in the Chevron decision delivered

25

by Justice Stevens that if a statute is ambiguous or is
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

silent, that a court should not substitute its interpretation

2

of what a statute means over and above that of an adminis­

3

trative agency who has provided that statute with a reasonable

4

administrative interpretation.
QUESTION:

5

6
7

The agency changed its mind, didn't

it?
MS. KRAUSE:

Well, it depends on if you are talking

8

about in-court documents or out-of-the record documents.

9

The agency stopped using Section 17 which is not at all

10

surprising because in 1926 Congress enacted legislation

11

that would have allowed utilities to go ahead and condemn

12

Pueblo property without any participation or consent by

13

the Pueblo and without any participation by the United States

14

and, indeed, because of that reason a District Court in

15

New Mexico ruled that it was unconstitutional.

16

in 1908 and 1928 Congress adopted legislation that the general

17

right-of-way statutes that applied to the other Indian tribes

18

in the United States would also be applicable to the Pueblo.

19

At that point in time, there really is no necessity to use

20

Section 17, although it does seem to appear from the record

21

that the Secretary used Section 17 whenever a Pueblo was

22

willing to consent to give the right-of-way and only use

23

the 1928 Act initially when a Pueblo refused to consent

24

to give a right-of-way.

25

Therefore,

The reason I said that about inside or outside
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of the record is I understand there is a filing by the Pueblo

2

of Taos which attaches the Department of Interior letter

3

to the Solicitor General where they take the position that

4

Section 17 should not have been used.

5

to that, I would only say that the amicus brief filed before

6

this Court is filed on behalf of the United States and I

7

would assume the decision has been made that that was an

8

appropriate administrative practice.

9
10

QUESTION:

Do you see eye to eye with the United

States amicus brief?

11

MS. KRAUSE:

12

don't see eye to eye.

13

QUESTION:

MS. KRAUSE:

And, in response

Not on the res judicata issue we

I think —
QUESTION:

So, you think Section 17 is limited

to just conveyances of right-of-way?
MS. KRAUSE:

I think the United States indicates

that this Court could limit its decision if it so chose.

20

QUESTION:

21

MS. KRAUSE:

Was that your position?
This Court — Mountain Bell's position

22

would be that it could.

23

extention is of Mountain Bell's argument, I will readily

24

admit that the logical extension of that argument is that

25

the Pueblo is authorized to sell, grant, lease, or convey

If you are asking me what the logical

2

QUESTION:

That is my difficulty as to where one

draws the line.

4

any further?

5

short of going all the way?

6

Why does the S.G. just go so far and not

What is the justification for his stopping

MS. KRAUSE:

Well, I think the justification is

7

we reached the Tenth Circuit and, indeed, reached this Court

8

was because that is what the record was based on and that

9

is what the administrative practice basically involved.

10

At the time this interpretation was developed,

11

it seems quite clear from reading the legislative hearings

12

that Congress simply did not address one way or another

13

the question of rights-of-way when it was discussing the

14

Pueblo Lands Act.

15

It did discuss, however, the fact that the Pueblos

16

had, since this Court's decision in Joseph, been conveying —

17

making conveyances of their property without any United

18

States participation or approval.

19

It was also informed that after this Court's decision

20

in Joseph the territorial courts of New Mexico had held

21

that the Pueblos were subject to the New Mexico state statutes

22

of limitations.

23

was informed of.

24

was being remedied at the time the hearings on this Act

25

were held.

So, there were two evils that Congress
They were informed that one of those evils

Congress was informed that since the New Mexico
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Enabling Act and since this Court's decision in United States

2

v. Sandoval that Pueblo alienations, conveyances, and leases

3

were being approved by the Department and that is how the

4

exercise of guardianship had been put into practice in New

5

Mexico regarding Pueblo conveyancing.

6

The Pueblos historically had the power to convey

7

their property under the Spanish Sovereignty provided that

8

it was approved by the Sovereign and there is support for

9

that proposition into the Mexico jurisdiction in cases of

10

this Court.

11

that would indicate that Congress meant to deprive the Pueblos

12

of their historical power to convey property.

13

thing in the legislative history is that the Sovereign's

14

approval was being exercised since this Court indicated

15

in Sandoval that some kind of guardianship responsibility

16

or relationship was involved with the Pueblo Indians and

17

the United States.

18

There is nothing in the legislative history

QUESTION:

The only

Ms. Krause, can I go back for a second

19

before I lose the thought to the question of limiting the

20

case to rights-of-way.

21

because that is where the main administrative practice was,

22

why, maybe that is all you have to do.

23

I think, there were 64 conveyances of right-of-ways and

24

one conveyance of land, all of which were approved by the

25

Secretary?

Your argument, I gather, is that

But, isn't it true,

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MS. KRAUSE:

The deposition that was before the

2

Tenth Circuit makes reference to the fact that there was

3

one out-right conveyance but it goes into no detail and

4

I have no knowledge about the surrounding circumstances

5

from the record.

6

QUESTION:

I see.

I was thinking if it were true,

7

even if it was only one, and the Secretary followed the

8

same practice there, I don't know why the argument wouldn't --

9

How you can chop it off.

10

MS. KRAUSE:

I think the United States would like

11

the administrative practice and the decision of this Court

12

to be limited.

13

if it wants, but I don't think Mountain Bell feels awkward

14

or embarrassed by the concept that the logical extension

15

of its argument is that the Pueblos could convey their

16

property under the second clause of Section 17.

17

this Court would want to so hold, it would certainly go

18

far to articulate, at least for the Pueblos, what the extent

19

of their power is under that statute.

20

I think this Court can limit its decision

QUESTION:

And, if

It isn't really what we want to hold.

21

We are construing a statute and it seems hard for me to

22

believe it means one thing with one kind of a conveyance

23

and another thing with another kind.

24
25

MS. KRAUSE:

I would agree.

19

20
21

The first is that it is directed to conduct

The section then is clearly talking about consentual
and voluntary activity.
The second thing that is fairly obvious about

22

the language is that it is language substantially similar

23

to the Non-Intercourse Act of 1834 that was on the books

24

at the time the Pueblo Lands Act was passed in 1924.

25

That statute as written was by 1924 an anachronism.
18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

It still read that a treaty or a convention was required,

2

but in 1871 Congress had stated that no more treatying should

3

be done with the Indians.

4

Therefore, the second clause of Section 17 sub­

5

stitutes for something that was already anachronistic, a

6

requirement of Secretarial approval to validate the Indian

7

conveyance.

8

Department of Interior was the way that the United States

9

had been exerting its guardianship at the time the Pueblo

10

And, as I have explained, the approval of the

Lands Act hearings were taking place.

11

The Secretarial approval requirement, as I said,

12

took the place of the treaty or convention requirement and

13

to the extent that the people involved in the transaction

14

complied with the restriction, the conveyance that was attend*

15

to that statute was valid in the same way that a conveyance

16

made within the confines of a treaty or a convention was

17

clearly valid under the Non-Intercourse Act of 1834.

18

The first clause of Section 17, on the other hand,

19

is written in language distinctly different from the second

It states that "no right, title, or interest in

an involuntary transaction, something that is done against

3

the Pueblo as opposed to done with their concurrence on

QUESTION:

Yes, but the section does speak of

transfers in any other manner, doesn't it?
MS. KRAUSE:

It doesn't speak of transfers in

8

any other manner, it says or in any other manner, no right,

9

title, or interest or in any other manner.

10

What the Department of Interior did —

11

QUESTION:

Doesn't that suggest something other

12

than just involuntary transfer?

13

MS. KRAUSE:

It suggests something broader than

14

involuntary alienations under laws of the State of New Mexico.

15

And, if you applied the general ejusdem generis principles

16

you have got a broader clause that is followed by limited

17

involuntary types of language and the most that "or in any

18

other manner" would then refer to would be to some other

19

types of involuntary losses that arose other than by the

20

State of New Mexico and, indeed, the Department of Interior --

21

22
23

QUESTION:

And where do you get the source of

that interpretation?
MS. KRAUSE:

Well, it is the interpretation of

24

the Department and it is also an interpretation that arises

25

out of a generally well-recognized statutory construction

2

QUESTION:

Used in generous.

3

MS. KRAUSE:

Right.

Along those lines I might

4

just say that the Department of the Interior did find a

5

meaning for that language.

6

from acquiring a right-of-way under an 1899 statute or

7

Mountain Bell from acquiring a right-of-way from the Secretary

8

under the 1901 statute.

QUESTION:

Indeed, it prohibited the railroad

While I have you interpreted, I think

10

you may have already answered this in response to Justice

11

O'Connor, but giving 17 the interpretation that permits

12

voluntary sale on the Secretary's approval, what point is

13

under Section 16?

14

MS. KRAUSE:

Under Section 16, Justice Brennan,

15

the Secretary of the Interior has some very clearly stated

16

administrative responsibilities with money.

17

the property with the consent of the Pueblo.

18

claimant who had made the claim before the Board is the

19

loser, meaning he doesn't buy the property, then the Secretary

20

is required to take the money, give some of it to the Indian

21

tribe and give the rest of it to the claimant who had made

22

improvements on the property.

23

24

he gives to the Pueblos the benefit and value of the

25

improvements that were made by the non-winning claimant.

So, he has some clearly defined administrative responsibilites

2

that are integral to the entire Pueblo Lands Act resolution

3

that are not addressed in Section 17.

4

Section 17 --

5

QUESTION:

6

Is that to say that 16 has nothing to do

with the form that the conveyances should take?
MS. KRAUSE:

7

It does not address what type of

8

form they should and the Secretary is the seller under Section

9

16, not the Pueblo.

10

The Pueblo is a consenting body to

the sale under Section 16.
I think the briefs also make clear, I am sure

11
12

this Court is aware, they were put into the statute at differen

13

times.

14

whereas 17 is prospectively addressed to deal with transactions

15

that occur outside of the Pueblo Lands Act.

Section 16, however, is integral to that statute,

I would like to reserve the remainder of my time

In the entire history of Indian affairs in this

unbridled discretion to approve conveyances of unallotted,

unseeded tribal lands and yet Petitioner would have this

2

Court enshrine an interpretation of Section 17 of the Pueblo

3

Lands Act as a wholesale transfer of Congress' own power

4

over conveyances of Pueblo tribal land transactions.

5

Section 17 is one of the last sections of a statute

6

passed in 1924 of quiet Pueblo titles and validate the titles

7

of a very carefully limited group of non-Indian settlers

8

that Congress decided deserved to have their titles validated

9

under the procedures of this Act.
QUESTION:

10

But ever since 1924 have most or all

11

of these been transfers only with the consent of the

12

Secretary?

13
14

MR. BORG:

Yes.

Each of these transfers or so-

called transfers has been with the consent of the Secretary.

15

QUESTION:

That is all?

16

MR. BORG:

Yes, but not with the consent of Congress.

17

QUESTION:

Any suggestion that there be consent

18

of Congress before this date?

19

MR. BORG:

Congress -- The idea is that Congress

20

under the Non-Intercourse Act must authorize conveyances

21

of Indian land.

22

to the Secretary of the Interior to a group.

23

continuous and consistent practice of Congress has been

24

to allow only conveyances of very limited interest in Indian

25

land and Congress itself has imposed statutory conditions

It has never given carte blanche power
In fact, the

on such conveyances and has required regulations.

2

Section 17, on the other hand, does not limit

3

in any manner the kinds of conveyances of Pueblo Indian

4

land that can be made.

5

on the Secretary of the Interior or the tribes and it does

6

not even require the issuance of regulations.

7

it does not require that the Indians receive just compen­

8

sation and, in fact, one of the problems that developed

9

in the use of Section 17 was improvident conveyances.

It imposes no conditions whatever

Moreover,

The

10

Secretary of the Interior did not give adquate authority

11

and that has been recognized by Congress in carefully

12

retaining unto itself that kind of authority over the disposal

13

and conveyance Indian lands and not giving the Secretary

14

such a massive transfer of its own authority.

anything like that.

24

MR. BORG:

No.

QUESTION:

Congress gave its consent

If it is consent conditioned on the

approval of the leaders of the tribe and also --

9

MR. BORG:

Right.

10

QUESTION:

-- the Secretary are the same conditions

11

in Section 17.

12

MR. BORG:

No, those are not the same conditions

13

because -- not precisely the same conditions because Section

14

17 does not impose any requirement that the transaction

15

be judged in the best interest of the Indians as does Section

16

16.

does Section 16 and it does not require that it be by option

It does not require the issuance of regulations as

The difference is, I suppose, that

Neither of those --

QUESTION:

Why does the statute then refer to

any Pueblo Indian living in a community?

6

template individual ownership of some of the land.

7

is what --

8
9

MR. BORG:

It seems to con­
That

It seems to contemplate such ownership

in the future and I would bring to the Court's attention

10

that Mountain Bell does not do anything to explain that

11

particular clause, the second clause of Section 17.

12

We believe that that clause has a rational meaning.

13

Pueblo lands were not allotted at the time of the passage

14

of the Pueblo Lands Act.

15

adhering to the policy of allotment, but until Congress

16

went ahead and issued allotments and removed the restrictions

17

on alienation that are commonly given to allotments,

18

individuals couldn't sell.

19

Congress at that time was still

The United States does not believe that individual

20

Pueblo Indians could sell.

21

but the language of that statute, the second clause, indicates

22

that Congress must act in the future to allot Pueblo lands

23

before individuals can sell.

24
25

Mountain Bell says they could,

In a parallel fashion, Congress must act to
authorize the Secretary and the Pueblos to convey lands

2

QUESTION:

But those two kinds of authorizations

3

are quite different.

4

Pueblo isn't authorized to convey land to which he has no

5

title and if Congress ultimately allots lands, then the

6

individual Pueblo would have the sort of title he could

7

convey.

8

from the second kind of authorization you spoke of.

9

The first would be that an individual

But, that is quite a different kind of authorization

MR. BORG:

Indeed.

The authorization that Congress

10

was referring to for sales by individuals was somethiong

11

it contemplated doing in the future.

12

templated in the future allowing tribal lands to be conveyed

13

under various statutes that Congress would pass allowing

14

the very limited kinds of conveyances for rights-of-way,

15

for leases, for other purposes that Congress has done both

16

before and since the Act.

17

Likewise, it con-

The second clause of Section 17 merely references

18

the existing statutes by which Congress had already

19

authorized very limited transactions in Indian land and

20

it refers to the future, both in allotment and for tribal

21

lands to acts of Congress that would allow future conveyances.

22

The significant thing about Section 17 is that

23

the first clause addresses the evil that Congress sought

24

to remedy in the Pueblo Lands Act, namely, conveyances and

25

losses of Pueblo land through adverse possession.
27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The first clause completely wipes out any kind

2

of loss of Pueblo land without congressional authority.

3

The second clause simply references that the Secretary of

4

the Interior who did have broad supervision over administra­

5

tion of Pueblo lands must approve transactions when those

6

transactions must be approved under the congressional statute.

7

It is highly unlikely that Congress would in the

8

future pass any kind of a statute that would not require

9

Secretarial approval.

As noted by Mountain Bell, the second

10

clause addresses conveyances.

11

required Secretarial supervision for conveyances of allotted

12

Indian lands and further kinds of transactions.

13

was not going to pass a law in the future saying that the

14

Pueblos could convey independently of the Secretary.

15

has been a fundamental part of the Secretary's role in

16

supervising and managing Indian lands throughout the last

17

90 to 100 years.

18

Congress has generally

Congress

That

Section 17 must be viewed in a common-sense way.

19

It must be viewed as simply declaratory statement by Congress

20

that the Pueblos were subject to the full benefits and

21

protections of the Indian Non-Intercourse Act.

22

The Pueblo Lands Act sought to give effect to

23

this Court's decision in United States v. Sandoval which

24

held that the Pueblos were tribal Indians subject to the

25

same protections and having the same status as other tribal

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Indians in this country.

That reversed a prior decision

2

and finally gave effect to the intent of Congress in 1851

3

when it extended the Non-Intercourse Act to New Mexico

4

specifically to protect the Pueblos.
So, the evil that Congress sought to remedy in

5

6

1924 was that long history of maybe 30 or 40 years from

7

the Joseph decision where the Pueblos were placed in a unique

8

status, stripped of the protections of congressional control

9

of their lands.
Congress had no reason to turn around in the same

10
11

Act by which it had accomplished that goal and simply cast

12

the Indians adrift, subject only to the unbridled discretion

13

of the Secretary or his lesser subordinate.

14

The interpretation that Mountain Bell is advancing

15

here would authorize conveyances going all the way down

16

the line through the bureaucracy of the Bureau of Indian

17

Affairs.

18

of-way even today are commonly done at the agency level

When lands have been seeded or when lands have

2

been allotted, Congress has generally allowed some kinds

of broader control to the Secretary, but that is part of

the emancipation process that allotment sought to promote.

Earlier that has been disavowed.

MR. BORG:

Francis Wilson was trying to represent

the interest of a lobbying group on behalf of the Indians,

generally a fairly wealthy group of persons in the early

12

1920's in New Mexico and in New York who wanted to preserve

MR. BORG:

2

On the surface that might be true,

3

but in actuality the Pueblos and Indian tribes generally

4

do not exercise very much independent judgment in these

5

kind of affairs. Whether it is voluntary or involuntary

6

doesn't really matter because they generally rely on the

7

judgment of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the officials

8

who are designated to fulfill this country's guardianship

9

responsibilities.

10

They are not treated any better under Section

11

17 by requiring their consent because the conditions that

12

Congress uniformly imposes on these kinds of statutes for

13

conveyances are not available to them.

of Justice Stevens.

3

MR. BORG:

Some people might agree.

On the surface

4

it sounds fine, you know, requiring Pueblo approval, and

5

that is what is done in the present statutes by regulation

and in some cases by statute consent is required of Indian

tribes for these limited type conveyances.

There have been other procedures

In conclusion I would like to say that in three

unanimous decisions of this court, U.S. v. Sandavol, U.S.

11

found to be entitled to the exact same status and the exact

12

same protections given other Indian lands.

13

Section 17 was turned on its head and used to

14

undermine the Non-Intercourse Act and to usurp the authority

15

of Congress over Indian affairs.

16

Petitioner's argument would have this Court place

17

the Pueblo Indians in a unique status, stripped of some

18

of the same protections as other Indian lands and could

19

have implications beyond this decision and we ask the Court

to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and to continue

MS. KRAUSE:

The Non-Intercourse Act or the Section

4

17 is basically an adoption of the Non-Intercourse Act and

5

shows that the second clause of Section 17 uses the language

6

of the Non-Intercourse Act that was on the books.
The first clause of Section 17 in essence is the

7

first legislative statement of what had been held to be

of land occurred in any other way voluntarily or

14

couldn't involuntarily transfer the land through statutes
