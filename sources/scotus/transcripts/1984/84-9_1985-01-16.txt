This case arises under an important federal

statute, ERISA, ana it is safe to say that if the

12

statute was working the way Congress intended that it

should, the case would not be here today at all.

New, it talks about duties imposed

upon fiduciaries by this subchapter.
MR. NOLAN:

What are they?

Some cf them are defined

10

explicitly, Justice Brennan, and others are to be

11

inferred from the law cf trusts to which Congress

12

committed the entire statute of ERISA for its

13

administration.

14

409, in addition to requiring that fiduciaries

15

make good to the plan any loss occasioned by the breach,

16

it requires that fiduciaries restore tc the plan any

17

gains that they have made from

QUESTION:

the use of

plan assets.

Well, didn't trust law generally

19

provide for recognizing that a beneficiary should be

20

made whole?

21

You just suggested, I think,

that Congress

22

delegated to the law of trusts much of what ERISA was

23

intended to accomplish.

MR. NOLAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

which provides that participants and beneficiaries have

the right to enforce their benefits under the plan,

HR. NOLAN:

Hr. Nolan?

I thought

That's generally true, that's

generally true. Justice -QUESTION:

Well, then, my question remains why

12

would damages be available under a section providing for

13

equitable relief?

14

HR. NOLAN:

Well,

I think in part this is

15

terminology,

but to the extent that it involves the

16

restoration of the plan, it would be involved, in our

17

view, under Section 409, and the courts in dealing with

18

Section 409 have used, as this Court undoubtedly

19

recognizes --

QUESTION:

HR. NOLANc

Sure.
-- a

wide variety of equitable

remedies to do justice.
QUESTION;

Rut is damages one of the wide

variety of equitable remedies that they have used?
HR. NOLAN:

It is usually not.

Oh, it is

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

always not in the context of 409, and it is usually not

2

in equity generally.
QUESTION;

4

And it could be other remedial

relief, in any event.
HR. NOLAN;

5

I believe that the key language,

6

Justice O'Connor,

is such other equitable or remedial

7

relief, which ties that clause very specifically to the

8

two preceding clauses.

9

way Respondent reads it here by skipping from the

I don’t think it can be read the

10

authorization at the top of Section 409 right down into

11

that language and reading it as if it read equitable

12

relief or remedial relief.
QUESTION;

13
14

isn’t the law of trusts

historically a creature of equity?
MR. NOLAN;

15
16

Well,

It is really tied together.

The law of trusts is very

definitely a creature of equity, Justice White.
QUESTION;

17

And suits against trustees raise

18

equitable questions.

19

MR. NOLAN;

20

I guess the most significant point about

That's correct.

21

punitive damages is that they are not mentioned

22

anywhere, not just in 409, but not mentioned anywhere in

23

ERISA.

24

extensive legislative history of ERISA.

25

They are net mentioned anywhere in the very

QUESTION;

Well, at the same time, Mr.
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Nolan,

1

is there mention in the discussions in the legislative

2

history of preemption of state remedies, that Congress

3

intended to preempt any that gave more than just --

4

beneficiaries more than just the benefits of the plan?

5

HR. NOLAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

NR. NOLAN:

There is no -Did Congress say that explicitly?
There is nothing that I know of in

8

the legislative history, Your Honor, that would suggest

9

that Congress intended to give the beneficiaries

10

anything more than their benefits under the plan.

11

think

I

that the key -QUESTION:

12

No, what -- no, my question was

13

whether in saying this Congress also said, and to the

14

extent beneficiaries had any right to anything else

15

under state law no longer, get only what ERISA

16

pro vid es.

17

NR. NOLAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

KR. NOLAN:

That is correct.

That --

Did Congress say that expressly?
Congress said it in the statute in

20

the preemption part of ERISA, that any law relating to

21

employee benefit plans would be preempted,

22

course, differentiates ERISA from a number of other

23

federal statutes which intend expressly to leave state

24

law standing.

25

MR.

NOLAN:

Well,

and that, of

I am still wondering,
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

was

1

there anything said in the legislative history

2

indicating

3

specifically to the rights of beneficiaries under

4

ordinary trust law in the states?

that the Congress addressed itself

MR.

5

NOLAN;

No, Justice Brennan, there was

6

not.

There was much in the legislative history on the

7

point

that we have been discussing just the last couple

8

of minutes.

9

suggest over and over and over again that the rights

There is much in the legislative history to

10

established in Section 409 are the rights of the plan,

11

not the rights of individual beneficiaries.
Punitive damages,

12

as I was saying, are nowhere

13

mentioned in the statute, and that we find

particularly

14

significant because it is plain that

15

to provide for punitive damages, they know exactly how

16

to do it.

17

the Securities and Exchange Act in 1934, and running

18

through TEFRA in 1982,

19

different statutes.

20

enacted in 1974, the same year that ERISA was enacted.

21

And that I think, as this Court has recognized on ether

22

occasions, is very strong evidence that they didn't

23

intend

24

absentminledly overlook them.

25

QUESTION;

when Congress wants

In the last fifty years since enactment of

they have done that in fourteen

Three of those statutes were

Were there any states that allowed

2

was enacted?
MR. NOLAN*

3

Punitive damages as we know,

4

Justice Brennan, are found in many states,

5

many,

6

pension and welfare laws, and there were actions under

7

those laws,

8

in part was what Congress was driving at,

9

refer to the legislative history in seeking --

10
11

not all,

but

and of course, there was a variety of state

and there were a variety of results.

QUESTION;

again,

That
to

And the variety of results in seme

instances --

12

NR.

NOLAN;

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. NOLAN;

The variety of results, exactly.
-- included punitive damages.
Including punitive da mages in

15

amounts that were arbitrary, inconsistent,

16

and including as Congress said a uniform source of law

17

for evaluating fiduciary conduct which they sought to

18

establish in ERISA which that kind of system would not

19

proviie for.

20

I think that --

21

QUESTION;

Well,

unreliable,

are you saying that it was a

22

regular feature of trust law in one or more states or a

23

lot of states that would award punitive damages in

24

connection with suits against trustees who have stolen

25

from the fund or who engaged in some kind of conduct?

QUESTION:

4

wouli

NOLAN:

No.
As well as just surcharging them,

they award punitive damages as part of trust law?
NR. NOLAN:

5

No,

I don't think that it was ever

6

any more than a rare and occasional anomaly of trust

7

law.

8

under state law for wrongful termination, cases like

9

this under state law,

10

I was referring to different kinds of actions

not employee benefits cases on

trustees.
QUESTION:

11

So you would say even if there was

12

no preemption, there is no basis for awarding punitive

13

damages against a trustee.
HR. NOLAN:

14
15

White,

16

carefully,

There are cases like that,

but -- and we have reviewed that fairly
but they are rare --

17

QUESTION:

18

HR. NOLAN:

All right.
And they are anomalous, and

19

actions by a beneficiary against a trustee are

20

ill-favored and rarely --

21
22

Justice

QUESTION:

But you can’t say that in this case

Well, does your opponent question

MR. NOLAN:

11
12

I think there is quite clearly

preemption in this case.

9

10

that would challenge that holding.

I don't believe that our opponent

does.
I would like to return again to the

comprehensive legislative scheme that is ERISA,

I think that that is perhaps the most persuasive single

reason

not available here.

19

ERISA is among the most comprehensive statutes -- and

20

where it provides for private remedies in some

situations,

that is very strong evidence that it didn’t
