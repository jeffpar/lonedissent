Ms. Smith, I think you

ORAL ARGUMENT CF BARBARA A.

H. SMITH, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

7

please the Court,

8

this Court for review are whether the due process clause

9

of the United States Constitution as held by the Supreme

10

Judicial Court of Massachusetts requires judicial review

11

of the sufficiency of the factual findings of the Prison

12

Disciplinary Board when those findings form the basis

13

for a loss of good

14

the particular issues that we bring to

time credits to inmates.

Second, assuming that judicial review is

15

required, whether the Constitution requires any greater

16

scrutiny than inquiry into whether the decision is

17

supported by some or any facts.

18

The particular issues, however,

I think

19

implicate a much more fundmental and far-reaching issue,

20

and that is the extent to which the Court will involve

21

itself in the eternal decisionmaking ability of prison

22

administrators.

23

This case concerns what I belie ve is a very

24

central concern of the prison system and that is the

25

ability of the administrators to maintain discip line

1

within the system.

2

requiring certain procedural requirements of the

3

disciplinary hearing, but indeed establishes the court

4

as the ultimata fact finder in this area.

5

This decision goes far beyond merely

To subject the internal determinations

6

regarding discipline to judicial second-guessing will

7

result in substantial disruption to the prison system,

8

to unnecessary but increasing demands on the judiciary,

9

and will result in minimal salutary benefit to the

10

inmates.

11

Now, the specific incidents which give rise to

12

the instant case are as follows.

13

A guard on duty at a wing door into the yard at Walpole

14

State Prison heard an inmate call out, "What’s going on

15

here?"

16

out to the yard, where he again heard the inmate call

17

out, "What's going on here?"

18

I will be very brief.

The guard moved to a window in the door leading

He peered out the window, observed a

19

commotion, opened the door, and found the inmate

20

bleeding from his mouth, with a puffed eye.

21

immediately observed three inmates jogging away down a

22

closed-in walkway into the regular yard.

23

He

Disciplinary reports issued and a hearing was

24

held for each inmate.

25

substantially as I have just described.

The reporting officer testified
However, in the

4

(202) 628-9300

1

hearing for innate Crawford -- Hill -- I'm sorry -- the

2

officer testified that a medic had told him that the

3

injuries were consistent with the inmate having been

4

beaten.

5

Crawford testified that he knew nothing of the

6

event and offered an affidavit from the injured inmate

7

that Crawford had

8

testified that he knew nothing about the event.

9

not been involved.

Hill also

The Hoard found the inmates guilty and ordered

10

loss of 100 days*

11

appealed to the Superintendent who affirmed the decision

12

of the Disciplinary Board.

13
14

good time credits.

Hill and Crawford

By regulation, the Commissioner of Correction
also reviews any loss of good time cases.

15

The inmates then filed a pro se complaint in

16

the Superior Court of Massachusetts, alleging that the

17

evidence was insufficient to support the finding of the

18

Disciplinary Board.

19

the Disciplinary Board's findings, concluded that as a

20

matter of law the Board’s findings of guilty rested on

21

no evidence constitutionally adequate to support the

22

findings of the Board.

23

QUESTION;

The Superior Court, having reviewed

May I ask, Ms. Smith, I gather that

24

Massachusetts practice provides for this review in

25

Superior Court, does it?
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MS. SMITH;

I believe it provides only as a

2

result of the Supreme Judicial Court held in this case.

3

Now, the Superintendent appealed the Superior Court

4

Decision, allegina that there was no constitutional

5

rioht to judicial review of this nature, of the

6

sufficiency of the findings.

7

The Supreme Judicial Court held that there is

8

no statutory right of review in Massachusetts for issues

9

of this nature, but that its reading of Wolff v.

10

McDonnell, it felt, logically entitled an inmate to

11

judicial review as a matter of constitutional law.

12

Therefore, having reached this result, the Court

13

construed Massachusetts law, particularly the certiorari

14

aspect of Massachusetts law, as providing the

15

appropriate vehicle for raising this constitutional

16

claim* not that it was an independent statutory right,

17

independent of the constitutional finding.

18

QUESTION;

19

Ms. SMITH;

How much of this is state law?
The decision, I don't believe, is

20

state law at all.

21

Judical Court refers to this Court’s decision in Wolff

22

v. McDonnell, and they rule specifically and that was

23

the issue presented to them, that it is the

24

Constitution, the due process clause in the United

25

States Constitution which mandates judicial review.

Throughout the opinion, the Supreme

QUESTION

So whether or not

I think you

2

suggested the inmates have a constitutional or

3

nonccnstutiona1 claim in respect to a disciplinary

4

hearing, they are not entitled to any judicial review --

5
6

7

MS. SMITH:
evidence.

Cf the sufficiency of the

Yes, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

that is our position.

When you say sufficiency, would

8

that be — are you Questioning the standard?

9

there was absolutely no evidence in the record instead

10
11

Suppose

of what you had here.
MS. SMITH:

Then I think, Your Honor, we*d gt

12

into a question of whether there is an arbitrary

13

capricious denial of the in mates' liberty interest,

14

which I believe is quite di fferent from the court

15

reviewing the weight,

16

evidence upon which a Board makes its decision,

the c redibility, the quantum of

17

And it is the lat ter that our court has said --

18

QUESTION:

In oth er words, you would concede

19

that the law, whether it wa s -- say, federal law --

20

requires that there be some evidence in the record to

21

support the finding of guil t.

22

MS. SMITH:

I bel ieve that that is the scope

23

Of review where there is a claim of an arbitrary denial

24

of a constitutionally prote cted right.

25

QUESTION:

And vo u would agree that the
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Constitution requires review to that extent?

2

NS. SNITH;

3

QUESTIONi

Yes,

I would, Your Honor.

Sc your argument really is on the

4

standard of whether it’s sufficiency or just some

5

evidence.

6

That's your real bone of contention.
NS. SNITH:

That is one bone of contention.

7

The ether bone of contention is whether the Constitution

8

requires the reviewability in general.

9

very difficult to separate the question of reviewability

10

in general from the question of scope of review, because

11

many of the same factors inform the decision in both

12

areas.

13

QUESTION:

Well,

And I think it's

I thought you agreed with me

14

that you did need reviewabilty in general in order to

15

determine whether the decision was entirely arbitrary.

16

How else could you ever know it was entirely aribitrary

17

without some kind of judicial review?

18

NS. SMITH:

Then I might rephrase it;

19

reviewable only for arbitrary or capriciousness, but not

20

reviewable for determination of suffficiency.

21
22

QUESTION:
that extent.

23

NS. SNITH:

24

QUESTION:

25

But you do agree it's reviewable to

To that extent, yes.
So you're not complaining there's

no review at all.

(202) 628-9300

1
2

MS. SEITH;

5

QUESTION;

Which I think then boils down to

the fact that you are disagreeing on the standard of
review.

That's the whole case.

6

7

But to a very

limited extent is there any review.

3
4

So, Your Honor.

MS. SMITH;

That is certainly a large part of

the case, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION;

9

MS. SMITH;

Well, what else is there?
Your Honor, I don't think that we

10

can pass over or just ignore the Question of what is the

11

constitutionally required general scope of

12

reviewability.

13

and I think the case of Ortwein v. Schwab points out

14

what I mean here.

15

And I will move ahead in my argument,

In that case, a petitioner claimed that an

16

order reducing his welfare benefits was not supported by

17

reliable, probative, or substantive evidence.

18

judicial review was provided by the state there;

19

however, a $25 filing fee precluded these indigent

20

appellants from having access to the state-provided

21

judicial review.

22

Now,

This Court held that there was no due process

23

violation.

24

appellate review, that due process only requires a

25

predetermination evidentiary hearing.

It held that due process did not require

And where

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

procedural requirements are met, due process requires

2

nothing more.

3

Now, that case dealt with reviewability

4

didn't limit it self to the standard

5

applied if someone alleged arbitrary and

6

capriciousness.

7

question that we are presenting here,

8

reasoning that applies in Ortvein should be applied in

9

the case at hand.

10

that would be

I think it is on all fours with the
and that the same

Going back to, if I may, the reliance of the

11

Supreme Judicial Court on the Hoff decision, I think

12

it's entirely misplaced and reads much too much into

13

that decision.

14

In Wolff, this Court merely set out certain

15

procedural requirements to be applied to disciplinary

16

hearing, included advanced written notice of the

17

charges, an opportunity to be heard, and to present

18

evidence under certain circumstances, and a requirement

evidence to support

2

I would think in the arbitrary and capricious

3

considerations, the petitioner would have the burden of

4

isolating some incident that, would indicate some kind cf

5

arbitrary and capricious conduct, either that there is

6

no evidence or that the Board acted in some type of

7

non-impartial manner or in some type of bad faith.

8

In this case, our court acknowledged that all

9

the procedural requirements of Wolff had been met, that

10

the decision was made in good faith.

11

QUESTION;

So part of your argument as to the

12

nature of the right in question perhaps goes to where

13

the burden of proof lies.

14
15

MS. SMITH;

That is one of the considerations.

Yes, Ycur Honor.

16

QUESTION;

Then do you or don't you think that

17

the Constitution requires review of prison disciplinary

decisions that are arbitrary?

5

abr idged.

6

the Cour t only i ndicated the

This sentence simply doesn't support the

7

proposition that the Constitution reguires that every

8

disciplinary hearing involving loss of good time credits

9

be reviewed for the sufficiency of the evidence.

Loss

10

of gccd time credits does not involve the loss of a

11

fundamental constitutional right, and in any event the

12

court indicated the primary reason for the requirement

13

of this statement was for its use in collateral

14

administrative proceedings such as transfer decisions

15

based on the incident or parole determinations.

16

As I have already indicated in the Grtwein v.

17

Schwab case, this Court has held that due process simply

18

doesn't require a state to provide appellate review.

19

Now, in other cases, the Court has specifically rejected

20

the notion that mere entitlement to procedural

21

protection in certain administrative hearings carries

22

with it a concomitant right to judicial review of the

23

sufficiency of the evidence in those hearings.

24

25

And these determinations affect a broad range
of interests, including the welfare benefit situation in
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Ortwein, the situation in court martials proceedings»

2

and in particular the decisions within the deportation

3

system, because the Court recognizes that the crux of

4

due process is you get a fair hearing.

5

And the Court has held that a fair hearing is

6

not established by proving that the decision of the fact

7

finders was wrong.

8

specifically held that a wrong inference drawn from the

9

evidence or if it is wrongly decided that evidence that

In Tisi v. Todd, the Court

10

has teen introduced constituted legal evidence of a fact

11

to be decided, the fact that these mistakes were made

12

doesn't render that hearing unfair.

13

And therefore, the Court in these areas has

14

refused to grant review to the factual findings of the

15

tribunals.

16

QUESTION:

Ms. Smith, may I interrupt again on

17

the basic right to judicial review?

18

correct that in Ortwein, the Court held there was nc

19

riqht to judicial review, but the basis for that was the

20

premise, even in criminal cases, there is no right to

21

judicial review.

22

You’re guite

But that does not mean, as I understand the

23

holding, that there's no right to review of the question

24

whether the judgment was constitutionally permissive.

25

It's not review of the basic merits of the case, but
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

whether the judgment is void because it was not in

2

conformity to the Constitution.

3

MS. SMITH:

Doesn't that premise that there is

4

a constitutional standard that disciplinary boards have

5

to fellow or have to meet in making their evidentiary

6

decisions?

7

QUESTION:

It certainly does.

But for years

8

it was thought that the review on an evidentiary basis,

9

a constitutional question would be whether there was

10

some or any evidence, the Jackson v. Virginia standard

11

-- or the Thompson v. Louisville standard.

12

that's been modified by Jackson v. Virginia, I don’t

13

know.

14

Whether

But surely, you're not contending that there

15

is nc proceeding in which the constitutional validity of

16

the prison action can be looked at is required, are

17

y ou ?

18

MS. SMITH:

I was looki ng only at review

19

evidentiary sufficie ncy, and I a in saying there is

20

constitutional right to review of that na rrow area

21

QUESTION:

22

NS. SMITH:

I see.
I *d just like to mention the

23

Hewitt v. Helms decision in which this Court, involving

24

the transfer of an inmate to administrative segregation

25

resulting in a curtailment of liberty within the prison
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

system, held that due process was satisfied if the

2

inmate gets notices of the reasons for the hearing»

3

opportunity to be heard, and the decisionmaker reviews

4

an

the evidence.

5

There was no suggestion that there is an

6

additional due process procedural requirement that

7

judicial review of the legal sufficiency of the evidence

8

upon which a transfer to decisions is based is an

9

additional requirement of due process.

10

Finally, in resolving the question of

11

reviewabilty, I'd ask this Court to apply its

12

traditional analysis and weigh the relative interest to

13

the individual, to the state, and to balance the utility

14

of judicial review against the burden that it would

15

place upon the prison systems and indeed upon the

16

courts.

17

The due process clause is flexible and its

18

scope depends on the context in which it is applied.

19

This Court has already acknowledged in Wolff the

20

critical need to impose with discipine in the prison

21

system to ensure the safety of the other inmates as well

22

as the guards.

23

The Court has already recognized that prison

24

administrators have a better grasp of their domain than

25

a reviewing judge.

In Massachusetts alone.

Let me ask one other question on

23

the threshold question, whether there is any judic ial

24

review at all.

25

The Solicitor General in his brief

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

requires judicial review of the claim arises only when

2

the applicable statutes would otherwise bar an aggrieved

3

party from raising a claim in court.

4

If, as in this case,

a statute authorizes

5

judicial review, there is no need to determine whether

6

such review is constitutionally required.

7

9, he interprets the Supreme Judicial Court's holding as

8

an interpretation of state statutes authorizing judicial

9

review.

10

Do you agree or disagree?

11

MS. SMITH;

12

QUESTION;

13

Then on page

I disagree.
You just think he’s read the case

incorrectly?

14

MS. SMITH;

I think, unfortunately, he was net

15

a party in the case below, does not know how the case

16

went up to the Supreme Judicial Court, and seems to fail

17

to recognize the fact that the Supreme Judicial Court in

18

a footnote specifically said in this case there is no

19

statutory right to review in Massachusetts.

20

What the court did, I think what the Solicitor

21

General's office misses, is that after finding a

22

constitutional right to review, they construed existing

23

Massachusetts law to accommodate that constitutional

24

finding.

25

QUESTION:

The Solicitor General thought it
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

was a civil action in the nature of certiorari.

2

MS. SMITH:

It was originally brought as a

3

civil action in the nature of a writ of habeas c orpus ad

4

testificandum.

5

Even if it was brought as a writ of habeas corpu s under

6

Massachusetts law, that too would have been

7

inappropriate because the remedy available was n ot

8

immediate release, as is required by the state h abeas

9

corpus.

10

Well, that clearly wasn't making it.

Therefore, the court having decided th a t

11

constitutional right to bring this action posite d

12

certiorari as the appropriate vehicle to accommo date the

13

Constitution.

14

They were not going to leave it, sayin g

15

there's a constitutional right, but we in Massac husetts

16

will not observe it.

QUESTION:

MS. SMITH;

You don't agree with that?
I don't -- I do agree that if

5

there is a constitutional right, the appropriate vehicle

6

may well be certiorari.

7

8

QUESTION:

And certiorari only exists if there

is a constitutional right.

9

MS. SMITH:

That was the court’s holding here,

10

that certiorari -- no one brought the action in the

11

nature of certiorari, but that since there is a

12

constitutinal right, Massachusetts must provide some

13

vehicle for asserting the right, and they indicated --

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. SMITH:

16

What's the right, Ms. Smith?
Constitutional right to judicial

review.

QUESTION:

he stands there at the scene of the assault and he's

basis for depriving somebody of their liberty interests,

for incarcerating them for,

Ms. Sabino, the certiorari statute

QUESTION;

Well, now what I want to get at is,

this standard as a flexible standard based on the

particular issue in front of them.

4

If the issue in front of them is the

5

constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty

arbitrarily and capriciously, then I believe that would

7

be the appropriate standard.

8
9

Certainly, I argued below to the Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court that a sufficient evidence

10

standard was the appropriate standard.

11

believe, however, that this is a case in which this

12

court should make a decision on the distinction between

13

the "some" and the "sufficient" evidence because the

14

court below did not decide that.

15

I do not

I believe that the certiorari statute that the

own department's rules of regulation and other types of

going to look at the dispute of standards between

2

whether it’s some evidence or substantial evidence#

3

because in this case it only -- the evidence here does

4

not meet the "some" evidence standard.

5

I would argue that based on other

6

Massachusetts laws and regulations and those in other

7

states, that a substantial evidence test might be the

8

more appropriate test; specifically, when the department

9

itself is bound by its own reaulations that a prisoner

10

11

must be found guilty by a preponderance of the evidence.
Again, substantial evidence does not raise

12

that, but it would be an indication of their having to

13

follow their own regulation.

14

However,

in this particular Court, based on

15

what the Supreme Judicial Court has found,

16

would be inappropriate to go above or argue beyond the

17

some cr any evidence standard.

18

QUESTION;

I think it

But the Supreme Judicial Court did

19

proceed cn the basis that there was a constitutional

MS. SABINO;

A constitutional right -- T

That issue was not argued, nor was it raised,

from what I can see in the reading of the cases in the

other courts that examined prison disciplinary hearings.

In each of those cases, a writ of federal
