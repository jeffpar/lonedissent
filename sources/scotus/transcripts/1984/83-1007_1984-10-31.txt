1

Section 7605(f) deals with summonses which are seeking

2

identities cr information about unknown taxpayers.

3

Section 7609(a) applies when the IRS has the identities

4

and is seeking information

5

designated record keepers.
Now,

6

about those people from

whether Section 7609(f) applies in this

7

case depends on hew you read that statute, how you read

8

Section 7603(f), and at first glance the statute dees

9

seem ambiguous — but only at first glance.
The problem is that Congress used the word

10
11

"person" in

12

that a

13

identify the person with respect to whose tax liability

14

the summons was issued.

15

the singular in Section 7609(f).

It said

summons is a John Doe summons if it fails tc

I don't think there would be any doubt, though

16

-- I don't think the government would contend that

17

Congress didn't expect 7609(f) to be used to obtain

18

identities of mere than one person.

19

Cne of the examples Congress uses in the

20

legislative history, ore of the examples it uses cf how

21

the summons was to be applied was in the case of a

22

corporation in which the IRS was trying to get the names

23

of the shareholders cf a corporation who had been

24

advised that a corporate reorganization was a tax-^ree

25

transa ction.
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Now, the government takes the position that as

1

2

long as the summons identifies one person with respect

3

to whose tax liability it was issued, it's not a John

4

Doe summons.

5

of the statute.

But that can’t be a correct interpretation

Suppose, in the example of the corporation

6
7

that had advised taxpayers that the reorganization was

8

tax-free, suppose that the IPS served a summons which

9

said,

"Furnish us with the letter that you gave to John

10

Smith advising him the transaction was tax-free, and

11

also furnish us with the names and addressesd and Social-

12

Security numbers of all the ether shareholders in the

13

corporation

who received the letter."

I don’t think the government would contend

14
15

that that summons was net a John Cce sunmens simply

16

because it identified one of the shareholders, John

17

Smith,

18

who the IRS said was under audit.
So the real problem with the statute is that

19

the word "person” is used in the singular.

20

statute said that a John Doe summons was a summons that

21

did not identify a person or persons with respect to

22

whose tax liability it was issued, then interpreting the

23

statute in this case would be much easier.

24
25

If the

But that is clearly what the statute means.
Otherwise, the IPS could get around the John Dee summons

2

who was under investigation.
The statute itself confirms that the word

"persons."

"person” must be read as "person" or

Cne of the summonses described in sutsecticn

7602.

Cne of the summonses — the summons served under

10

Section 76C2 is your standard, run-of-the mill summers,

11

served on a taxpayer who's under audit, and who is

12

obviously identified in the summons.
The summons served on Tiffany Fine Arts was a

13
14

Section 7602 summons, and it seems to me that Section

15

7609(f) says quite clearly that it applies tc that kind

16

of a summons.

17

statute is not so ambiguous after all.

So the language and the meaning of the

4

Eut when the Service argues that Section

how that can happen.

10

And this case shows exactly

Tiffany tried to show in this case that the

whole thrust of the summons served on it, the whole

Ferhaps I

I understand that under the Ccurt

14

of Appeals interpretation cf the statute, they will get

these names if it's a secondary purpose.

16

reading of the statute, could they ever get the names of

17

people that they just have kind of a hunch that maybe

18

these franchisees, or whatever they are, ought to be

locked at or ought to be audited, without first having

some basis for believing there was a deficiency cf seme

New, the government argued in its brief that
when the record keeper is under audit, there is no need
for the John Dee summers rules to apply; that in the
course of a normal enforcement proceedings, the courts
will be able to scrutinize these summonses, just as they
would have in tne ex parte proceeding under Section

But that argument presupposes that there will

Congress obviously wanted when it wrote Section

Now, the rule, the interpretation of Section

11

7609(f) that we are urging on the Court, we are not

12

suggesting that the Court should rule that the IRS must

13

comply with the John Dee summons procedures whenever it

14

seeks identities of customers cf a record keeper who is

15

under audit.

16

The rule we are urging is that when the evert

17

acts of the agent and the published institutional

18

posture cf the Internal Revenue Service demonstrate that

19

a purpose of the summons is to investigate the

20

customers, then the John Doe procedures must be complied

21

with before the summons can be enforced.

22

The interpretation essentially is the rule set

23

down in the Thompson case in the Sixth Circuit.

24

it's a good rule for a number of reasons.

First, it

25

squares with the language cf the statute.

It asks,

was

the answer to that question is yes,

3

ON BEHALF CF THE RESFOMEENT

4

MR. WALLACE;

5

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

6

please

the Court, cur starting point in this case is to

7

point out that this is not a third party summons in this

8

case.

9

summon s.

It is what is known in tax practice as a taxpayer

It was a summons issued to Tiffany and its

10
11

sutsidiaries, and it names Tiffany and its subsidiaries

12

as the taxpayer whose liability is under examination in

13

this summons.
A major fccus of the proceedings below was to

14
15

determine whether this was a summons legitimately issued

16

for that purpose, and whether the records and

17

information requested were properly producible for that

18

p u r po s e .

19

That phase of the case was litigated under the

20

standards first articulated in United States v. Powell

21

and reiterated many times by this Court, and was quite

22

properly, that part of the case, litigated the same way

23

it would have been litigated prior to 197b when all cf

24

Section 760S first came intc the statute.

25

And there were affidavits submitted by the

and the legal argument by the United States attorney

shewed that the agent felt that he had to be able to

20

income with deposits and receivables and to verify that

2

the transactions reported by the Petitioners actually

3

were the transactions that occurred .

4

And this was soundly based on based on

5

principles that this Court established in Holland v. the

6

United

7

cases, the net worth tax case in which

8

out that certainly Congress never intended in the

9

provision there at issue, which was one that limited the

States hack in 348 U.S., one of the leading tax
the court pointed

10

govern ire r.t * s authority to deviate from the taxpayer’s

11

method of accounting, certainly the government --

12

Congress never intended to make that provision a set of

13

blinders which prevents the government from locking

14

beyond the self-serving declarations in a taxpayer's

15

b c c ks.
To protect the revenue from those who do not

16
17

render true accounts, the government must be free to use

18

all legal evidence available to it in determining

19

whether the story told by the taxpayer's bocks

20

accurately reflects his financial history.
And, in light of those legitimate purposes,

And the legal question before this Court is

4

whether anything in the Tax Reform Act of

6

1976 , which

And we think the answer to that.question

7

emerges with the greatest clarity if we lock at Section

8

7609 as a whole, as a package,

9

Congress as a package and discussed in the committee

10
11

because it was treated by

reports as a package.
Before turning specifically to 7609(f), the

12

first provisions in 7609 dealt with notice and rights to

13

intervene for certain identified persons.

14

two aspects of Section 7609 that make it highly

15

implausible that Congress would have wanted or wculd

16

have intended that statute to change the result that you

17

would have reached under the Pcwell standards prior to

18

its enactment.

And there are

One is that the very title of Section 7609,

20

which says "Special Frccedure for Third Farty

21

Summonses," that is part of the statute.

Nr. Wallace/ let's just assume that

the names cf the customers were completely irrelevant tc

Tiffany's audit or Tiffany's liability, and that Tiffany

said,

New, why isn't that a third party summons?

9

MR. WALLACE:

10

That would be a third party

11

summons with respect tc that request, but what I pointed

12

out is that that -- the question whether the request for

13

that ir.fcrmaticr was properly producible as a taxpayer

14

-- as part cf the taxpayer

15

was litigated below and upheld by concurrent factual

New, the second aspect of 7609 that makes it

5

highly implausible that Congress meant to change the

6

result that would be reached under Powell with respect

7

tc a taxpayer summons is that Congress enacted in 7609

8

provisions directly dealing with summons enforcement

9

proceedings and the legislative history with respect to

10

these previsions, where they gave seme additional

11

taxpayer standing to contest summons enforcement

12

proceedings, shewed that Congress informed itself in

13

detail of the substantive standards that this Court had

14

developed, and explicitly said that they did not want to

15

change them in any respect.
They did not want to expand any rights tc
