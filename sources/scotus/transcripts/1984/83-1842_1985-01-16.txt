MR. DE MASSA;

since it is a substantive offense which is defined by

8

MR.

It could not?

DE MASSA;

Could

not.

For the very same

9

reasons that this Court over a century has held in In re

10

Nielsen, and In re Snow, and in other cases that it is a

11

continuing offense -- the business of drug activity is

12

proscribed course of conduct.

20

the same offense as his continuing criminal enterprise

RICO?

7

We submit that the same-offense question can

8

be answered only by a focused and concrete examination

9

of the offenses that Congress has created.

The Double

10

Jeopardy clause recognizes that it is the province cf

11

Congress to prescribe criminal offenses, and it does not

12

limit the offenses that Congress can define.
The decisive question, therefore, is did

13

Congress create separate offenses?

Now in effect,

this

15

is what the Blockburger test determines in the area in

16

which it is applicable to true greater and lesser

included offenses.

18

not simply that it can't be applied, but where it can be

19

applied and is not satisfied, it cannot be said that the

offenses are different in any sense.

Where Blockburger is not satisfied,

MR. LEVY:

That depends on the statute that

Congress passed.

Congress could have passed a CCE-like

25

offense that was nothing more than an aggrevated form of

that.

The question is whether this statute is like

that;

or whether, as we contend, it is not simply an

4

aggravated form of the predicate, but a different

5

offense and different in a meaningful and substantial

6

way that Congress intended at the time.
From its text, we can see that CCE is based on

the new concept of an enterprise.

This indicates that

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT BY MR. DE KASSA
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

5

MR. DE MASSA:

6

The Solicitor General indicates

7

that Jeffers conspiracy is not one of the predicates of

8

the prosecution in Jeffers.

If that were so, then they

9

would be separate offenses.

If that were so,

there

10

would

be no necessity to have a lesser included offense

11

instruction as was indicated by Justice Blackmun in his

12

decision that lesser included offenses instructions

13

would

be warranted in that case.
There was a citation of Kiebel,

14

and there were

15

other

citations after Kiebel from Jeffers which indicate

16

that you don't just look at the statutory elements cf

17

the crime to determine whether or not a lesser included

18

offense instruction is warranted, but you look at

19

whether or not the evidence warrants those

20

instru ctions.
Two of those cases are Beck vs.

21

vs. Evans.

Alabama, and

22

Hopper

Those cases indicate that you look at

23

the underlying facts to determine whether or not a

24

lesser included offense instruction is warranted in a

25

case.

It's clear in this case that if the evidence is

and

That does not make a CCE a separate offense.
You cannot have a CCE offense without having

lesser offenses are felonies, that's to be sure, in this

case;

Now those

they're not misdemeanors as you normally find in

statutes; but because of the punishment aspect of CCE,

you get a tremendous lever with this type of punishment

If Congress, as Congress intended and did,

intended to proscribe against the business of drug

Jeffers several years later after Jeffers came out and

2

concluded that CCE was a conspiracy offense.

3

because other circuit courts have been stating that 846

4

and 953 are conspiracies, and therefore since Jeffers

5

says 848 is a conspiracy offense, we're not going to

6

allege conspiracies in volving the same indictment for

the same conduct because the defendant would plead to

the conspiracy and buy the 848 charge.

QUESTION!

And

Why isn't the CCE statute analogous

10

to an habitual offender statute?

11

NR. DE MASSA;

Because,

in order to have an

12

habitual offender statute or a recedivist statute, you

13

are putting an offender who is offending more than on:e

14

on notice by his prior convictions for nonrelated

15

offenses that his subsequent act and subsequent conduct

16

in a new offense unrelated to his prior offenses is

17

going to cumulatively punish him, is going to greater

18

punish him for the new offense.

19

QUESTION:

why doesn't this statute put

drug offenses, he might be charged with --

In any event, the

There's just no comparison between those and a CCE
