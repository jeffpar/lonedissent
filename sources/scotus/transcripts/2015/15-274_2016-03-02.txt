CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Hellerstadt.

Ms. Toti.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE TOTI

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MS. TOTI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Texas requirements undermine the careful

12

balance struck in Casey between States' legitimate

13

interests in regulating abortion and women's fundamental

14

liberty to make personal decisions about their

15

pregnancies.

16

that create substantial obstacles to abortion access.

17

They are unnecessary health regulations

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Toti, there is a

18

preliminary question ­­ would you address that ­­ that

19

this claim is precluded.

20

that was in the prior litigation.

21

they're separate claims, or let's take the admitting

22

privileges.

23

precluded?

24
25

And let's take first the claim
Let's assume that

That was argued and decided.

MS. TOTI:

Why isn't it

Your Honor, it's not precluded

because material facts relevant to the claim developed

Alderson Reporting Company

subsequent to entry of judgment in the Abbott case.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you could have

3

amended ­­ you could have asked for supplemental

4

briefing.

5

after the Supreme Court issues its decision in this

6

case.

I mean, the new action is filed six days

You could have asked for supplemental briefing?

7

MS. TOTI:

In Abbott the plaintiffs brought

8

the ­­ the new facts to the attention of the court of

9

appeals.

The court of appeals said that it would only

10

consider evidence in the trial record in rendering its

11

decision, and it held that the evidence in the trial

12

record was speculative, that there wasn't a sufficient

13

basis to conclude that any doctor would be unable to

14

obtain admitting privileges, or that any clinic would be

15

forced to close as a result of the admitting privileges

16

requirement.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you're asking ­­

18

you made allegations concerning those same claims.

19

mean, is your argument that when you have allegations on

20

a facial challenge and a facial challenge is resolved

21

against you, that all you have to do is come up with new

22

evidence and then you can start over again?

23

MS. TOTI:

No, Your Honor.

The ­­ the ­­

24

the evidence must be material, and it must be newly

25

developed.

So newly discovered evidence wouldn't be

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

5
1

sufficient.

2

the time of the first suit, but the plaintiffs merely

3

hadn't discovered the evidence or didn't bring it

4

forward, that wouldn't provide the basis for a

5

subsequent suit.

6

judgment in the first suit that is material to the

7

claims does provide sufficient basis for a ­­ a

8

second ­­

9
10

If it was evidence that was available at

But evidence that develops after

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what's this key new

evidence?

11

MS. TOTI:

The ­­ the evidence is the clinic

12

closures that resulted from enforcement ­­ actual

13

enforcement of the admitting­privileges requirement.

14

the ­­ the first suit was a pre­enforcement challenge.

15

It was before the law took effect, and the court

16

concluded that there was not sufficient evidence that

17

any doctor would actually be unable to obtain admitting

18

privileges, or that any clinic would actually close.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, there is very little

20

specific evidence in the record in this case with

21

respect to why any particular clinic closed.

22

your argument is that the law took effect, and after

23

that point, there was a decrease in the number of

24

clinics.

25

So

Basically,

So suppose you win here, and the State then

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

examines what happened in each of these clinics and

2

comes up with evidence showing that in quite a few

3

instances, the closure was due to other factors.

4

then they would ­­ then could they take the position,

5

well, the decision of this Court holding that the law is

6

facially unconstitutional is not binding on us by res

7

judicata, and so you would have to sue them again, and

8

they would be able to make the same argument you're

9

making now.

And so

Is that correct?

10

MS. TOTI:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

MS. TOTI:

No, Your Honor.

And ­­

What's the difference?

Well, first of all, the State had

13

an opportunity to bring forward evidence in this case

14

about the reasons why ­­

15
16
17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Was it that ­­ was that

their burden?
MS. TOTI:

No, Your Honor.

Not in the first

18

instance, but the plaintiffs came forward with evidence

19

and ­­ and the State did not offer anything to ­­ to

20

rebut the evidence, which was more than sufficient to

21

support the district court's finding that HB2 was the

22

cause of the clinic closures.

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What ­­ what

evidence is that?
MS. TOTI:

There are a couple of things,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MS. TOTI:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What?

­­ alone ­­
I'm sorry.

Yeah.

10

What is the evidence in the record that the closures are

11

related to the legislation?

12

MS. TOTI:

The ­­ the ­­ the timing is part

13

of the evidence, Your Honor, and the testimony of the

14

plaintiffs about the reasons why their clinics closed.

15

So that the plaintiffs testified that clinics closed in

16

anticipation of enforcement in some cases, and in some

17

cases because of actual enforcement of the requirements.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can we go on to the

19

second piece; that is, the ambulatory surgical centers?

20

That was not part of the last case.

21

on that is that that is a discrete claim, so it's not

22

barred by a claim preclusion.

And your position

23

Is that ­­ is that your position?

24

MS. TOTI:

25

Yes.

That's correct.

And the

claims against the ASC requirement weren't ripe at the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

time that the Abbott case was filed, because the final

2

implementing regulations for that statutory requirement

3

hadn't yet been adopted.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, certainly in the

5

Federal system, and I assume in many States as well,

6

regulations sometimes take years to promulgate.

7

know of any rule that says we have to wait for regular

8

­­ regulations to be promulgated unless it's something

9

unanticipated.

10

I don't

And the key objections you're making

were clear in the statute, anyway.

11

MS. TOTI:

I would disagree that ­­ that the

12

extent of the burden that the law would impose was clear

13

on the face of the statute.

14

regulations were adopted ­­ and the statute provided a

15

deadline for the adoption of those regulations ­­ until

16

they were adopted, the plaintiffs couldn't have known

17

whether waivers or grandfathering would have been

18

permitted.

19

permitted, as they have been in every other ASC

20

requirement that's been adopted for abortion providers,

21

the burdens would have been much less, and the

22

plaintiffs would have first attempted to get licensed

23

and seek appropriate waivers before filing their suit.

24

This ­­

25

Until those implementing

And if waivers or grandfathering were

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

So you think you can

Official

separately challenge the admitting­privilege provision

2

and the ASC provision?

3
4
5

MS. TOTI:

Yes, Your Honor.

Because

those ­­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if you can

6

separately challenge them, if you challenge just the

7

admitting­privileges provision, how would you factor

8

in ­­ presumably, you would have to assume that the ASC

9

provision was not under challenge.

So in assessing the

10

burden, you would look at just the admission privilege.

11

And vice versa, if you're challenging just the ASC

12

separately, you'd have to assume you'd assess the burden

13

solely caused by that provision.

14
15
16

It seems to me the separation of the two
provisions makes ­­ would make your case much harder.
MS. TOTI:

I ­­ I would disagree with that,

17

Your Honor, because each of these requirements is

18

extremely burdensome on its own.

19

admitting­privileges requirement, which is partially in

20

effect, has been responsible for the closure of nearly

21

half of all the abortion facilities in Texas to date.

22

And the ASC requirement, if it took effect, the

23

Respondents have stipulated that it would close any

24

remaining licensed abortion facility that was able to

25

comply with the admitting­privileges requirement.

The

Alderson Reporting Company

So independently, each requirement is

2

extremely burdensome; and ­­ and collectively, the

3

one­two punch of these requirements would be responsible

for the ­­ the closure of nearly 30 ­­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I think the Chief

6

Justice asked ­­ I don't want to take words out of his

7

mouth ­­ but I think the question was, one of the two

8

lines that's been asked, is that in the district opinion

9

at page 7, the district court has said that if the ASC

10

regulation goes into effect, there will be one facility

11

left in Austin, two in Dallas, one in Fort Worth, two in

12

Houston, and either one or two in San Antonio.

13

before that, he said that the enforcement of the

14

appointment privileges, the privileges of admission,

15

would reduce the number from 20 down to about ­­ from 40

16

down to about 20.

17

And

Now, I think the question was, what evidence

18

did those findings rest upon?

19

other side, I think, say there is no such evidence, or

20

the court of appeals said there is no such evidence.

21

As you've heard, the

So can you give a brief account or page

22

numbers that will show that those findings, the

23

diminishment of the number from about 40 to about eight,

24

which is what the district court found, rested upon some

25

evidence?

What was that evidence?

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. TOTI:

Yes, Your Honor.

So initially,

2

20 clinics closed in the wake of HB2.

3

prior to initial enforcement of the admitting­privileges

4

requirement, and 11 closed on the day that the

5

admitting­privileges requirement first took effect.

6

Eight closed

Respondents quibble with the evidence

7

concerning the first eight.

there is basis in the record for the district court to

Where ­­ I'm sorry

Where in the record is that evidence?

MS. TOTI:

Your Honor, I can provide

14

specific pin sites during my rebuttal, but the evidence

15

is in the plaintiffs' testimony about the reasons why

16

their clinics closed.

17

Each of the plaintiffs' class testified that

18

their clinics closed either in anticipation of

19

enforcement of these requirements, knowing that ­­ that

20

the clinic would not be able to continue operating once

21

the requirements took effect, and as a result of that,

22

either they needed to move resources to remaining

23

MS. TOTI:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
As to how many, of the total

4

that you claim closed, do you have direct evidence about

5

the reason for the closure?

6

MS. TOTI:

Well, 11 of them, Your Honor,

7

closed on the day that the admitting privileges took

8

effect.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

And as to how many ­­

how many are you claiming total closed as a result of

11

the law?

12

MS. TOTI:

To ­­ to date, roughly 20 clinics

have closed.
JUSTICE ALITO:

And of the 20, how ­­ as to

how many do you have direct evidence?
MS. TOTI:

I ­­ approximately 12, Your

Honor, direct evidence.

6

MS. TOTI:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's correct.
And is it right that in the

8

two­week period that the ASC requirement was in effect,

9

that over a dozen facilities shut their doors, and then

10

when that was stayed, when that was lifted, they

11

reopened again immediately; is that right?

There have ­­ since this law has

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

8
9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

The effects of the Texas law at issue in

11

this case are much more extreme than those of any

12

abortion law that this Court has considered since Casey.

13

This law closes most abortion facilities in

14

the State, puts extreme stress on the few facilities

15

that remain open, and exponentially increases the

16

obstacles confronting women who seek abortions in the

17

State.

18

medical justification that cannot withstand any

19

meaningful scrutiny that the American Medical

20

Association has told you is groundless and that the

21

district court found will actually operate in practice

22

to increase health risks to women and not decrease.

23
24
25

And it does all of that on the basis of a

9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So I ­­ I agree with the

premise of Your Honor's question.

11

of the regulation that I think, operating alone,

some parts of the regulation actually restate and

point of Your Honor's question, I think the problem the

district court confronted here, and I think the reason

13

the district court acted reasonably, despite the

14

presence of the severability clause ­­ and the

15

severability clause provides an instruction that ­­ that

16

every provision, every clause, every word, every

application, every individual should be severed.

18

And the problem is ­­ the problem with the

19

kind that the Court noted, I think, in the Ayotte case,

20

for a court trying to apply that, the court's got to go

in and decide which collection of the many, many

With respect to the ­­ with respect to the

the others, I don't think there's evidence with respect

evidence that they closed in advance of the effective

MR. KELLER:

The policy set by Texas is that

23

the standard of care for abortion clinics should rise to

24

the level of ASCs for clinics, and admitting privileges

25

for doctors.

Texas obviously can't tell New Mexico how

7

MR. KELLER:

Well, here, the evidence in the

8

record showed that this particular clinic was 1 mile

9

across the border that was still in the El Paso

10

metroplex, and women in El Paso often used that facility

11

to obtain abortions.

12

So that would go into the contextual

13

analysis of this particular as­applied challenge.

doesn't go to the facial challenge, but the as­applied

15

challenge and whether women in El Paso do have access to

16

abortion.

Two responses, Justice

Ginsburg.

12

When there's a complication rate from a drug­induced

follow­up.

First, the complication rates are greater.

that complication is likely to arise near the women's

Mr. Keller, and of the State's position, that the

increase surgical abortions as distinct from medical

But I thought an

underlying theme, or at least an underlying factual

demonstration, is that this law has really increased the

Alderson Reporting Company

47

I'd like to go back to the ­­ the question

2

that Justice Ginsburg was asking, which is about what is

3

the benefit of this procedure.

4

There are two laws.

I am focusing on the

5

first law.

6

abortion clinic must have admitting privileges in a

7

hospital 30 miles within that ­­ nearby, right?

The first law says that a doctor at the

8

MR. KELLER:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
Okay.

Prior to that law,

10

the law was that the clinic had to have a working

11

arrangement to transfer such a patient, correct?

12

just reading it from this.

13

MR. KELLER:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm

That's correct.
Okay.

So I want to know,

15

go back in time to the period before the new law was

16

passed, where in the record will I find evidence of

17

women who had complications, who could not get to a

18

hospital, even though there was a working arrangement

19

for admission, but now they could get to a hospital

20

because the doctor himself has to have admitting

21

privileges?

22

tell me their names, what the complications were, and

23

why that happened?

24
25

Which were the women?

MR. KELLER:

On what page does it

Justice Breyer, that is not in

the record.

Alderson Reporting Company

48

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

MR. KELLER:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

But so ­­

What I'm ­­
­­ Judge Posner then seems

4

to be correct where he says he could find in the entire

5

nation, in his opinion, only one arguable example of

6

such a thing, and he's not certain that even that one is

7

correct.

8

So what is the benefit to the woman of a

9

procedure that is going to cure a problem of which there

10

is not one single instance in the nation, though perhaps

11

there is one, but not in Texas.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. KELLER:

Justice Breyer, the National

14

Abortion Federation previously recommended that women

15

use abortion doctors ­­

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't ask that.

I'm

17

sure there are people who had all kinds of reasons that

18

would like to have this and so forth.

19

I'm just asking you, where we have a judicial duty to

20

say whether this is an undue burden upon the woman who

21

wants the abortion, there are two parts:

22

burdened and what is the benefit?

23

And I'm not ­­

Is she

And now on the first one, I've asked you to

24

give a single example of an instance where there was a

25

benefit, and you say, I think quite honestly, there is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49

no such burden.

2

So let's turn to the second.

The second

3

one, according to the amicus briefs here, which I guess

4

I could validate, that even without the surgical center,

5

leave it out, there are risks quite correct.

6

risks are roughly the same as the risks that you have in

7

8

don't have an ambulatory surgical center.

9

12

Okay.

There are like

So I read them, and you read them.

13

And so what is the benefit here to giving, I

14

mean, the woman, her risk, I can't say it's zero here,

15

this ambulatory surgical center when the risk is

16

minuscule compared to common procedures that women run

17

every day in other areas without ambulatory surgical

18

centers?

19

MR. KELLER:

That has never been the test

20

under Casey about substantial obstacle.

21

in Simopoulos, even before Casey upheld an ASC

22

requirement, and there ­­ Virginia did not require that

23

brain surgery be performed in a hospital or an ASC.

if you lead to self­induced abortion, you will find many

of dying through a complication in a clinic, is this a

remedy that will in fact achieve the legislature's

And of course the argument is

So if the concern is this tiny risk

MR. KELLER:

Justice Breyer, about

is what ­­ do you have enough resources to open up an

MR. KELLER:

The point being that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I ask about McAllen?

5

There was testimony in the record that at least four

doctors had ­­ from that spot had asked for admitting

provided for one doctor, Dr. Lynn, who's past retirement

11

Now, if the clinic had ­­ I don't know how

12

many it had, but it had at least four people before ­­

13

it seems rather callous to say as a remedy that we're

14

going to make that one doctor do the work of four, or

15

maybe more doctors who didn't get admitting privileges.

16

Why is even the Fifth Circuit's remedy reasonable?

17
18

MR. KELLER:

Because, Justice Sotomayor,

that was the only named plaintiff for the as­applied ­­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that ­­ but ­­ if ­­

21

clinic because it can't get its doctors certified.

22

why does it require a named plaintiff to relieve that

23

clinic of the obligation of going without admitting

24

privileges?

25

As applied, the A ­­ ASC law is affecting this

MR. KELLER:

So

Well, that wasn't the only one

Alderson Reporting Company

of the four doctors that joined this lawsuit, because

2

most of the doctors and clinics in Texas are not part of

3

this lawsuit ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

requirement because you know that it's the only clinic

6

in the area.

7

MR. KELLER:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Well ­­
So if any doctor who's

licensed appropriately can get admitting privileges,
they should be permitted to work in that clinic.

Why does Dr. Lynn have to become an

indentured slave to ensure that women in her area are

higher medical standards, whether it has to do with the

higher medical standards, including much higher medical

6

standards for abortion facilities than for facilities

risky medical work.

understanding of the law; am I right?

You said that as the law is now, under your

12
13

And you said that that was your

MR. KELLER:

Correct, in this Court's ­­ in

Simopoulos.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I guess I just want to

know why would Texas do that?

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. KELLER:

When there are complications

16

from abortion that's in the record, Texas can enact laws

17

to promote safety.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, I know, but ­­ but the

19

assumption of the question, and I think you haven't

20

challenged this assumption, is that there are many

21

procedures that are much higher risk:

Colonoscopies,

22

liposuctions, we could go on and on.

And ­­ and you're

23

saying, that's okay, we get to set much higher standards

24

for abortion.

25

And I just want to know why that is.

MR. KELLER:

Justice Kagan, this bill was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

64
1

passed in the wake of the Kermit Gosnell scandal that

2

prompted Texas and many other States to reexamine their

3

abortion regulations.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, of course, the ­­ I

5

mean, Texas's own regulations actually have made

6

abortion facilities such that that can never happen,

7

because you have continual inspections, I mean, to your

8

credit.

9

having a kind of rogue outfit there.

10

So that was really not a problem in Texas,
Texas has taken

actions to prevent that.

11

So, again, I just sort of ­­ I'm left

12

wondering, given this baseline of regulation that

13

prevents rogue outfits of ­­ like that, why it is that

14

Texas would make this choice.

15

allowed to make this choice, and we can argue about

16

that.

And you say you're

I just want to know why Texas would make it.

17

MR. KELLER:

I think the amicus brief for

18

the 121 Texas legislators that canvasses the medical

19

evidence and canvasses statements confirms that that ­­

20

that there were complications that these laws do have

21

benefits.

And even the bill opponents said ­­

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it true ­­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Are you ­­ are you in ­­

24

you're not really contesting that there are greater

25

complications in abortion facilities than there are with

Alderson Reporting Company

65

a great deal of medical procedures that do ­­ that are

2

not subject to the same standard of regulation.

3

MR. KELLER:

Yeah, brain surgery, for

4

instance, just like Simopoulos, would almost certainly

5

have ­­ it ­­ it would have higher risk of complication.

6

But the point is to ­­

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

General, as to ­­ as to

8

rogue facilities, which Justice Kagan just mentioned,

9

one of the amicus briefs cites instance after instance

10

where Whole Woman's facilities have been cited for

11

really appalling violations when they were inspected:

12

Holes in the floor where ­­ where rats could come in,

13

the lack of any equipment to adequately sterilize

14

instruments.

15
16

Is that not the case?
MR. KELLER:

Stories similar to that are

also raised in the 121 Texas legislators' amicus briefs.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE TOTI

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MS. TOTI:

13

A few brief points.

Thank you.
First, the record cites

14

from earlier evidence that HB2 caused clinics to close

15

in Texas.

16

clinics in Killeen, Austin, Beaumont, McAllen, and El

17

Paso to close, and that testimony is at JA 339, 715, 722

18

and 731.

19

The plaintiffs testified that HB2 caused

Respondents stipulated at JA 183 and 184

20

that the ASC requirement would cause any licensed

21

abortion facility still operating on the day it took

22

effect to close.

23

Plaintiffs' Exhibit 28 at page 2, which is

24

not in the Joint Appendix but was admitted in the record

25

at 2808 and 09, demonstrates that for the five years

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

74
1

prior to the enactment of HB2, the number of abortion

2

clinics in Texas remained fairly constant.

3

And finally, at JA 229 and 1430, there is ­­

4

at 229, testimony from Dr. Grossman, and at 439, our

5

response to the Fifth Circuit's directive showing that

6

11 clinics closed on the day that the

7

admitting­privileges requirement was ­­

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that ­­ that's

the ­­ the last evidence was from Dr. Grossman?

10

MS. TOTI:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JA 229 is from Dr. Grossman's.
At page 232, he

12

said, "I am not here offering any opinion on the cause

13

of the decline in the number of abortion facilities."

14

MS. TOTI:

That's correct.

Dr. Grossman did

15

not offer an opinion on that.

16

supplies the fact, from which the district court drew

17

the inference, that 11 clinics closed on the day that

18

the State first enforced the admitting­privileges

19

requirement.

20

that enforcement was the cause of the closure, and

21

Respondents offered no alternative explanation for why

22

there would be such a precipitous drop in the number of

23

abortion ­­

24
25

But his testimony

The district court referred from that fact

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can you tell me why

Planned Parenthood left the western area?

Alderson Reporting Company

The General

Official

75
1

says that Planned Parenthood ­­ that ASC and the ­­ and

2

the admitting privileges had nothing to do with the

3

closures in the western area of Texas.

4

MS. TOTI:

Well, the ­­ the two clinics in

5

El Paso, which is in ­­ in ­­ in that western region of

6

Texas that would be forced to close as a result of these

7

requirements, are not operated by Planned Parenthood.

8

Planned Parenthood doesn't have any clinics in Texas.

9

The plaintiff in this case and another independent

10
11

provider operate those clinics.
JUSTICE ALITO:

And as to the ­­ the clinics

12

where there is direct evidence, does the direct evidence

13

show whether the cause was the admitting­privileges

14

requirement or the ASC requirement or both?

15

MS. TOTI:

It ­­ it ­­ with respect to ­­ it

16

does specify.

17

requirement, and some specify the ASC requirement.

18

some specify both.

19

And some specify the admitting­privileges
And

So with respect to whether abortion can be

20

regulated differently than other medical procedures,

21

abortion can certainly be treated differently, if there

22

is a reason to treat it differently.

23

impose unnecessary medical regulations that burden

24

women's access to abortion.

25

But Texas may not

In Simopoulos, the Court found that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

76
1

regulations of second­trimester procedures at issue in

2

that case were consistent with prevailing medical

3

standards at the time, and that was critical to the

4

court's decision.

5

That is not the case here.

There is

6

extensive testimony in the record that these

7

requirements are not medically justified.

8

consistent with prevailing medical standards, and their

9

amicus briefs from leading medical associations,

10

They are not

including the AMA and ACOG, confirming that.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that Federal

12

district judges or this Court is well qualified to

13

determine whether there is a different risk, regard ­­

14

with respect to abortion, as compared to other

15

procedures, that may or may not have to be required ­­

16

may or may not have to be performed in an ­­ in an ASC?

17

MS. TOTI:

Your Honor, district courts are

18

quite competent to determine the credibility and the

19

reliability of expert testimony.

20

that's within the core competence of a trial court.

21

the trial court in this case determined that there was

22

no credible or reliable evidence supporting Texas's

23

contentions about the medical justification for these

24

laws.

25

That's something
And

And, further, had Texas truly believed that

Alderson Reporting Company

77

these laws provided some important benefit for

2

outpatient surgery, it would have made them generally

3

applicable.

4

All outpatient surgical providers would have

5

to have admitting privileges or practice in an ASC, but

6

that's not the case.

7

Texas law expressly authorizes other

8

surgical procedures, including those performed under

9

general anesthesia ­­ which early abortion is not ­­ to
