ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOEL J. FRANCISCO

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

We'll hear argument

MR. FRANCISCO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

The government argues that in quid pro quo

11

bribery, "official action" encompasses anything within

12

the range of official duties.

13

conclusion, it asks that you disregard a 9­0 decision of

14

this Court.

15

In order to reach that

The government is wrong.

In order to engage

16

in "official action," an official must either make a

17

government decision or urge someone else to do so.

18

line is between access to decision­makers on the one

19

hand and trying to influence those decisions on the

20

other.

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's the Sun­Diamond

case, the 9­0 case that you refer to.
MR. FRANCISCO:

The

Yes, Your Honor, the

24

Sun­Diamond case, the 9­0 case.

25

Sun­Diamond confirms is that when an official simply

And I think what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4

refers someone to another official, an independent

2

decision­maker for an objective decision, he hasn't

3

crossed that line into prohibited "official action."

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I take it all parties

5

concede that the act of the university official to

6

undertake or not to undertake a research study would be

7

an "official action."

8
9

MR. FRANCISCO:
question is:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the

Did the Governor cross the line into

10

influencing officials to undertake that action and was

11

the jury properly instructed?

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you tell me the

13

posture of the case with reference to under Virginia

14

law, the government ­­ the Governor's authority or lack

15

of authority to tell the university, you will engage in

16

this research or you will not engage?

MR. FRANCISCO:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

Sure, Your Honor.

He ­­

What is the state of the

law, and do ­­ do the parties agree on this point?

20

MR. FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, I think that the

21

parties agree that the Governor at least had a bully

22

pulpit authority, but he had very little authority to

23

actually direct any university researcher to do

24

anything.

25

are two critical questions:

And here I think one of the critical ­­ there

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would it have made a

5

difference if the medical faculties had agreed to the

6

testing?

7

MR. FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, if they had

8

agreed to the testing, I still don't think it would have

9

made a difference in terms of whether Governor McDonnell

10

tried to influence their decision on that, because he

11

didn't.

12

difference on the jury instructions because the jury

13

still wasn't instructed that it had to find that

14

Governor McDonnell tried to influence a particular

15

governmental decision, because it wasn't so instructed.

And it still wouldn't have made a ­­ a

19

were trying to influence the outcome, you would cross

that line into prohibited "official action" corruption.

15

it was, the Governor really wants us to do this.

MR. FRANCISCO:

23

the point is, what do we do with the fact that they

25

We just don't think it's a

MR. FRANCISCO:

Honor, a legal one and a factual one.

2

still need to instruct the jury that it had to find that

3

Governor McDonnell tried to actually influence a

4

government decision.

5

they could have completely agreed ­­

6

Legally, you

And here it wasn't instructed, so

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But why?

Isn't this ­­

7

I thought that this crime was taking money knowing that

8

it was being paid to influence an "official act."

9

aren't all of these examples of "official acts" whether

So

10

they are or they aren't irrelevant?

11

what was his intent at the moment he took the money?

MR. FRANCISCO:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The question is,

Yeah.
­­ a jury infer at that

15

moment that he took it with the intent to commit an

16

"official act" the way Mr. Williams wanted it committed?

17

MR. FRANCISCO:

So again, Your Honor, two

18

responses.

19

inferred it, you still need to tell them what an

20

"official act" is, that an "official act" is an attempt

21

to influence a governmental decision.

Even assuming that the jury could have

MR. FRANCISCO:

Well, to ­­ to actually, you

know, conduct tobacco commission­funded State studies,

3

but you still need to tell them what that is.

4

get directly to your question.

5

actual "official acts" are relevant?

6

both the district court and the courts of appeals'

7

opinions made clear.

8

But I'll

Why is it that the
And that's because

Here in this case, the corrupt agreement

9

turned entirely upon, as the district court case said.

10

It hinged upon whether the five specific acts were, in

11

fact, "official acts," because in the absence of any

12

direct evidence of a corrupt agreement, the government's

13

argument was that you could infer one from the pattern

14

of actual "official acts" on the one hand and the

15

pattern of gifts and loans on the other and the temporal

16

connection between the two.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so is it your position

18

at page 60 of the supplemental Joint Appendix ­­ the

19

instructions aren't numbered, which makes it a little

20

hard, but the judge instructs the jury that "official

21

actions" are set forth in the five paragraphs of the

22

indictment.

23

of those are not "official acts"?

24
25

And is it your position that at least some

MR. FRANCISCO:

Yes, Your Honor, and

certainly the five things that were proved in this case

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

11
1

are not "official acts."

2

any of those things, as they actually came into

3

evidence, demonstrated "official acts" because in none

4

of them did Governor McDonnell cross that line in trying

5

to influence the outcome of any particular decision.

6

And just as critically, the jury was never told it had

7

to find that.

8

Sotomayor, could have completely agreed with our version

9

of the facts.

So the jury in this case, Justice

11

did here was refer Johnnie ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The matter ­­
Well, this gets back

14

somewhat to Justice Alito's hypothetical about arranging

15

the meeting, and we ­­ and we can up the ante to see

16

how ­­ how close the meeting came to be an ­­ an

17

"official act."

18

your position is that a governmental ­­ that an

19

"official act" must be the exercise of governmental

20

power.

21

But I ­­ I take it that at some point

Is that your position?
MR. FRANCISCO:

Well, Your Honor, it's

either making a decision on ­­ on an exercise of

governmental power, trying to influence it, as in the

Birdsall case, where the defendants there were trying to

Alderson Reporting Company

But if you're simply setting up a meeting so

2

that somebody can appeal to the independent judgment of

3

an independent decisionmaker and you're not trying to

meeting, then that simple referral can't possibly be

official governmental action.

So you would think

And if I just understood you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14

2

correctly, that falls within the statute?
MR. FRANCISCO:

No, Your Honor.

I think

3

that would be a very close case.

4

a very close case, because at the end of the day, if

5

you're not actually making a governmental decision or

6

influencing the outcome of an actual governmental

7

decision, I think you ­­ and Chief Justice, you might

8

actually be violating a lot of other laws, including the

9

separate provision in Section 201 that prohibits you

That ­­ that would be

10

from undertaking any act in violation of your official

11

duties in exchange for money, or 5 U.S.C. 7353, which

12

prohibits you from ­­ from taking anything from anyone

13

whose interests could be affected by the performance or

14

nonperformance of your duties.

15

But I think that the line has to be, and the

16

only line that comes out through the cases is, you're

17

actually either making a decision on because of the

18

government, or you're urging someone else to do so.

19

You're trying to pushing them in a certain direction.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It seems to me when you say

21

"urging" ­­ now, wait.

22

different commission, the Brown Commission, the Senate

23

S1, the language of the statute, and I read "official

24

action," something quite similar to the statute here, "A

25

decision, opinion, recommendation, judgment, vote, or

See, I can go back to a lot of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

15
1

other conduct" ­­ perhaps other similar conduct ­­

2

"involving an exercise of discretion."

3

So in this case, the official action we're

4

talking about is giving money to a group of people in

5

the university to conduct a study.

6

Now, the Governor didn't do that.

But a

7

person who tries to influence an official action and is

8

also in the government is also guilty.

9

That's the Indian case.

10

MR. FRANCISCO:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

But wait.

You're correct.

But wait.

The word

12

"influence" is too broad, because every day of the week

13

politicians write on behalf of constituents letters to

14

different parts of the government, saying, will you

15

please look at the case of Mrs. So­and­so who was

that up.

what we should write as the words that describe the

22

criminal activity involved in talking to or influencing

Either you use it ­­

So you use

The key to the word in there is "merely."

All right.

Yes, Your Honor.
Because sometimes it could.
Yes, Your Honor.
And somebody might have the

embarrassing question, merely when it can or merely when
it can't.

Give me a little enlightenment.
MR. FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, I think that the

12

answer is, if ­­ if the evidence shows that there was ­­

13

and I hate to go back to the word that I ­­ I know you

14

don't like here, but if the evidence shows that there

15

really wasn't attempt ­­ an attempt to try to push the

16

separate decisionmaker that you're supposedly trying to

17

influence one way or another, but you really are just

18

sending it over for a meeting, and ­­ and that

19

independent decisionmaker is left to their independent

20

judgment, then you haven't crossed that line.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if ­­

Mr. ­­
The word ­­ the word that

23

Justice Breyer is concerned about comes from Birdsall,

24

with intent to influence their "official action."

25

can hardly fault the district judge for using in Ring

So we

the same words that this Court used in Birdsall.

2

MR. FRANCISCO:

I ­­ I agree, Your Honor.

3

thought that Judge Huvelle did a very good attempt at

4

defining, because she actually went further than what I

5

just read to you, Justice Breyer.

6

the lines that we proposed in our instructions that,

7

quote, "Mere favoritism as evidenced by a public

8

official's willingness to take a lobbyist's telephone

call or to meet with the lobbyist, is not an 'official

act.'"

11

So I think that the idea is, Your Honor ­­ I

12

understand, Justice Breyer, that influence itself

13

doesn't totally solve the problem.

14

court judges do is they then explain to the jury what

15

they mean by influence, and influence is not ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what district

Where can we find the best

definition, in your view, of an "official act"?

18

MR. FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, I think that the

19

best definition of an "official act" is ­­ is

20

essentially the one that I tried to articulate at the

21

outset.

22

on behalf of the government, or try in some way to use

23

your influence to pressure or urge or persuade or cajole

24

someone else who has governmental power to make a

25

decision on an action.

You need ­­ you need to either make a decision

second part.

Well, I ­­
Can I ­­
I agree with Justice

I just don't see the limiting principle in the

6

MR. FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, I think in many

7

­­ in some cases, I think the limiting principle might

8

be difficult; it's not a perfect and precise

9

formulation.

But I think in this case it's a

10

particularly easy principle, because here the jury

11

wasn't given any instruction on the line at all.

12

So Justice Breyer, in your hypothetical,

13

sending that letter over is an "official act" under the

14

instructions as given and under the theory pushed by the

15

Solicitor General's office in this case because it is

16

the action ­­

22
23

25

It seemed to me the "official

MR. FRANCISCO:

I ­­ I completely agree with

you, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under your view, under the

hypotheticals that have been thrown around, the janitor

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

22
1

who gets the bottle of beer in order to clean your

2

classroom first, I mean, is that ­­ is that a

3

governmental act?

4
5

MR. FRANCISCO:
but the government ­­

6
7
8
9

Certainly not in my view,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what's the

difference?
MR. FRANCISCO:

The difference is, one ­­

one is you're exercising power on behalf of the

10

government as a whole.

11

he's buying ­­ if he's using government money to buy

12

janitorial supplies and engaging in government

13

contracting, that's an exercise of governmental power.

14

If you're simply cleaning out a classroom, I don't think

15

you're exercising government power.

16

So the janitor, for example, if

So, too, when you simply send somebody to

17

another official for an independent and objective

18

decision by that official, but you don't try to put your

19

thumb on the scales of that decision, you haven't

20

crossed the line.

21

And I think it's very important in a

22

criminal statute like this, because if you really do

23

think that a referral, just simply making a referral, is

24

"official action" that crosses the line into bribery, I

25

think you do have some very serious vagueness concerns

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

23
1

with the Hobbs Act and on a services question ­­

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I ask ­­
Sure ­­ sure.

It

4

depends on who's making the referral or the call, right?

5

In Justice Breyer's hypothetical, if it's a

6

congressperson calling somebody and saying, could you

7

look into this matter for my constituent, the person

8

should look at it, I suppose, and then ­­ and that's one

9

thing.

If it's the President who calls and says, I want

10

you to look at this matter for my constituent, that

11

might exercise considerably more influence.

12

MR. FRANCISCO:

Two things, Your Honor.

13

First, you still do need to tell the jury that that's

14

what they have to find.

15

told in any way, shape or form that they had to find an

16

attempt to influence.

17

and of itself, to, at the very least, require a new

18

trial here.

19

And here, the jury was never

So I think that is sufficient, in

Under these instructions, as the government

20

itself seems to agree, any action within the range of

21

official duties constitutes official governmental

22

action.

23

So Justice Kennedy, in the letter being sent

24

over from a senator, since that is within the range of

25

official duties, that counts under the government's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

24
1

formulation, and under the jury instruction as given,

2

since it is, after all, a settled practice of officials

3

to send these kinds of letters.

4

incumbent upon the district court to draw some kind of

5

limit.

6

That's why it was

And here, the jury could well have agreed

7

with us that even though he was the governor of the

8

State, Mr. Chief Justice, he did not try to influence

9

the actual decision.

He simply made the same type of

10

referral that he made day in and day out during this

11

administration where he simply sent a constituent to the

12

appropriate official ­­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

­­ if ­­ you said something

17

before, and I might have misunderstood you.

18

think that ­­ of the five listed "official acts," do you

19

think none of them meet the standards that you're

20

suggesting, or do you think some of them do and some of

21

them don't?

22
23

MR. FRANCISCO:

Two answers.

But do you

First of all,

we don't think that any of them meet the standard.

Go ahead, please.

MR. FRANCISCO:

But secondly, the jury could

have agreed with us on that, given the evidence we put

further.

critical to this case, because even if they had agreed

with us, they would have been required to convict under

Do you disagree

here.

15

argument is that even if they agreed with all of our

view of the facts, they still would have been required

And secondly, our second argument is the

these are "official acts," but then I thought I heard

anything.

with what I see as as knotty and complicated and

difficult and basic a problem as I can think of.

argue the position that I came here to argue, which is

that "official action" is not limited by some arbitrary

litmus test that was proposed by Petitioner that would

exclude things that he calls "access."

that that's the right way to look at it.

5

Well, Justice ­­
That ­­ that's what I want

your view on.
MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Breyer, I'm going to

6

push back, because I think that the line that Petitioner

7

has urged is one that is a recipe for corruption, not a

8

recipe for drawing a safe harbor for public officials.

9

What he has basically urged the Court to

10

hold is that paying for access, if somebody does not put

11

a thumb on the scale of decision ­­ if I, for example,

12

tell the criminal division, take the meeting, make

13

whatever recommendation is in your best judgment, just

14

take the meeting, I can take money for that.

15

think the message that would be sent, if this Court put

16

its imprimatur on a scheme of government in which public

17

officials were not committing bribery when all they did

18

was arrange meetings with other governmental officials,

19

without putting, in his metaphorical way, a thumb on the

20

scales of the ultimate decision, would send a terrible

21

message to citizens.

Well, gaining

access by making campaign contributions is an everyday

widespread.

How does it ­­ how does that play out?

MR. DREEBEN:

So, Justice Alito, gaining

access and ingratiation and gratitude as a result of

as a quid pro quo, it is.

8
9

What would not make that a crime?

The

That would be the only thing separating

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, let ­­ let me say two

things in response to that.

First, this Court has

10

addressed that very issue in the McCormick case.

11

is established that merely taking favorable action at or

12

around the time of the receipt of campaign contributions

13

is not sufficient to show a quid pro quo and is not a

14

crime.

15

And it

Nobody doubts that if there's a quid pro quo

16

for a vote, something that I think Mr. Francisco is

17

prepared to concede is "official action," although I'm

18

not sure why since it doesn't personally exercise

19

sovereign power if a legislator casts vote as a

20

dissenting vote from a majority action.

21

disputes that that is a crime.

22

has already carved out evidentiary and instructional

23

safeguards that prevent against a jury inferring a quid

24

pro quo merely from the coincidence of timing.

25

But nobody

Therefore, this Court

But I want to come back to something that is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

42
1

even more fundamental, and that is the role of the First

2

Amendment in this case.

3

to wrap himself in the mantle of the First Amendment,

4

probably because the gifts that he received have nothing

5

to do with the First Amendment; they have to do with

6

personal loans and luxury goods.

7

Because Petitioner has sought

This is not a case about campaign

8

contributions.

9

issue, he relies very heavily on Citizens United while

10

But when campaign contributions are at

ignoring a critical piece of Citizens United.

11

This Court, in Citizens United, looked back

12

to the circumstances that prompted the Federal Election

13

Campaign Act in 1972, and those involve circumstances

14

that were delineated in the Buckley decision in the

15

court of appeals.

16

And the Court specifically cited to those

17

practices.

18

involved the American milk producers paying $2 million

19

in campaign contributions, spread out among a variety of

20

committees, to get a meeting at the White House.

21

all they did.

22

with White House officials on price supports, they paid

23

that money.

And what were those practices?

They

That's

They said, in order to gain a meeting

24

Other corporate executives testified that

25

paying money was a calling card, something that would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

43
1

get us in the door and make our point of view heard.

2

And this Court said, on page 356 of the Citizens United

3

opinion, "The practices Buckley noted would be covered

4

by the bribery laws, CEG 18 U.S.C. 201, if a quid pro

5

quo arrangement were proved."

6

Now, of course, it's very difficult to prove

7

a quid pro quo arrangement, and that's why there are

8

campaign finance limitations on contributions to

9

candidates.

10

But the Court had no doubt that paying for

access was a criminal violation.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. DREEBEN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so ­­
So ­­

And that's what ­­
­­ if you have a

governor whose priority is jobs for his State, and

15

there's a CEO who's thinking about locating a plant in

16

his State, but he can only do it, he says, if he gets

17

tax credits from the State.

18

So the governor is talking to him, and he

says, look, why don't you come down to my, you know,

trout stream and we'll go fishing and we'll talk about

21

this.

MR. DREEBEN:

afternoon of trout fishing, and he discussed official

circumstances in which a jury could find he did it

20

because of the gift.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought it

Yes.
And ­­ and so if all

23

he's doing is talking about ways to get jobs for

24

Virginia, and he's talking with the person who's going

25

to make that decision from the private sector, based in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

part on whether or not he gets, you know, tax credits,

2

it would seem to me that under your definition, that

3

governor is guilty of a felony.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm not sure that he is guilty

5

of a felony.

6

hypothetical to involve a larger quid is because the

7

implications of carving something out from "official

8

action" mean that it can be sold, and that it's lawful

9

to be sold.

4

If the Court is going to reject the

5

government's position in this case, then I think that a

6

fallback position for the government is when you have an

7

indisputed "official action," such as will the

8

universities of Virginia study a particular product, or

9

will the Tobacco Commission fund it, then when a public

official takes action to direct that decision, to

influence that decision, or to advance his benefactor's

Correct.
So if you had just ­­ if ­­

10

if the indictment, and then the instructions that were

11

based on the indictment, had said the "official act" is

12

getting the University of Virginia to do clinical

13

studies, right, that reads very differently from the way

14

this indictment was structured.

15

indictment does is it takes a lot of different pieces of

16

evidence that might relate to that "official act" and

17

charges them as "official acts" themselves, so that the

18

party becomes an "official act" or calling somebody just

19

to talk about the product becomes an "official act."

20

you see what I mean?

Because what this

21

I mean, you know, this might have been

22

perfectly chargeable and instructable, but I guess

23

I'm ­­ I'm troubled by these particular charges and

24

instructions, which seems to make every piece of

25

evidence that you had an "official act," rather than

just saying the "official act" was the ­­ was the

2

attempt to get the University of Virginia to do

3

something that they wouldn't have done otherwise.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

So, Justice Kagan, what the

5

crime was here was the Governor accepting things of

6

value in return for being influenced and taking

7

"official actions" to legitimize, promote, and secure

8

research studies for Anatabloc and Star's products.

9

That's at Supplemental JA 14.

10

It then alleges that he would do this as

11

opportunities arose in the course of his official

12

actions.

13

tremendous amount of influence throughout the

14

government, he appoints all the board of visitors of VCU

15

and UVA.

16

important guy.

17

in different ways over time.

18

And because he's the Governor and he has a

He sets the budget.

They know that he's an

He has lots of opportunities to do this

And if you look at the pattern of what he

19

did, directing people to meet with Star's

20

representatives, arranging events at the mansion in

21

which Star could bring together its chosen guest list,

22

the doctors who it wanted to influence with the Star

23

people who were trying to influence it, the Governor is

24

taking every step he can do short of saying to UVA, do

25

the studies, which his chief counsel told him would be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

55
1

inappropriate and wasn't going to do.

2

So I ­­ I think that if you look at the

3

indictment the way that it's actually structured, it

4

talks about a person who, as opportunities arose, was

5

going to engage in "official acts."

6

corruption that Justice Sotomayor's opinion in Ganim in

7

the Second Circuit validated, and it was cited in

8

Skilling as a perfectly valid theory of corruption.

9

This is a theory of

And, therefore, the individual "official

10

acts" really form a composite window into Petitioner's

11

mind.

12

controlled by the things of value that he received?

13

taking them all together, even if the Court has trouble

14

with any individual one, they allowed a rational jury to

15

inference that, indeed, he did.

16

Did he intend to allow his official conduct to be
And

And the only way that Petitioner could win,

17

if you agree with me on the sufficiency issue, is if you

18

conclude that jury instructions must exempt certain

19

types of official actions, like directing your Secretary

20

of Health to take a meeting, which is a very kind of

21

significant event in the life of a cabinet member and a

22

governor, or hosting an event at the mansion, can't

23

possibly count, because it somehow should be viewed as

24

social, when, in fact, what the Governor is doing is

25

allowing his benefactor to get all the people in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

56

room who he wants to influence to do the studies.

2

So in my view, there was nothing wrong ­­ if

3

I can complete the sentence ­­ in the way that the

4

indictment structured the crime in this case.

5

"official acts" were exemplary.

6

the jury could properly find them.

7

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FRANCISCO:

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

12

15

They were proved, and

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NOEL J. FRANCISCO

11

13

The

I have three basic points I would like to
make.
First, I'd like to start out with the

17

government's argument that a lot of the problems with

18

its theory are solved by the quid pro quo requirement.

19

Well, in fact, the gratuity statute, the Federal

20

gratuity statute, has the exact same "official act"

21

requirement, but no quid pro quo requirement at all.

22

So what that means is that if you take

23

somebody to a fancy lunch with a ­­ I can't remember the

24

name of the bottle of wine you mentioned, Justice

25

Breyer, but if you took them to that fancy lunch to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

57
1

thank them for referring you to a meeting with a

2

mid­level staffer, even if there was no suggestion at

3

all that you were going to do anything other than call

4

that staffer and say, hey, can you take a meeting with

5

this guy, hear him out, and exercise your independent

6

judgment, that would be a violation of the Federal

7

gratuity statute.

8
9

And, indeed, under the government's broad
theory that anything within the range of official duties

10

counts, that means that if you took the person out to

11

that lunch as thanks for giving you a tour of the

12

Capitol Building, you would likewise have violated the

13

Federal gratuity statute, because there, there is no

14

quid pro quo requirement at all.

15

Point two, Justice Breyer ­­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There is a difference

17

between someone saying, thank you for a decision you

18

made independent of the gift ­­ that's the Sun Growers

19

case ­­ and someone buying you an expensive lunch and

20

saying, I'm paying for this lunch, but make sure I get a

21

tour.

22

You don't see the difference?
MR. FRANCISCO:

Not under the Federal

23

gratuity statute, Your Honor, because the Federal

24

gratuity statute is meant to prohibit thanking somebody

25

for giving you an "official act."

Alderson Reporting Company

And so if an

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

58
1

"official act" is, in fact, a tour of the Capitol

2

Building or a meeting with a staffer, then you have, in

3

fact, violated the Federal gratuity statute when you

4

take them to lunch as a thanks for that particular act.

5

Second point, Justice Breyer, in trying to

6

figure out the right verbal formulation, the first point

7

I'd like to make is, if we can't figure out a proper

8

verbal formulation, then I think there are some ver

serious vagueness problems with the statute ­­
