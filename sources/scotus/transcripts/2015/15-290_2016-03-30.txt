ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

A jurisdictional determination issued by the

12

Army Corps of Engineers is not final agency action

13

because it does not order any person to do or refrain

14

from doing anything and does not alter anyone's legal

15

rights and obligations.

16

determination, or JD, expresses the Corps' opinion about

17

whether a particular tract contains waters protected by

18

the Clean Water Act.

19

recipient's assessment of the options available to it,

20

but it does not affect the actual legal status of those

21

options.

22

The jurisdictional

That stated opinion may affect the

This Court's precedents made clear that the

23

practical effects on which Respondents rely are not a

24

sufficient ground for treating an agency communication

25

as final agency action.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

Now, the Respondents primarily emphasize the

2

practical impact that the Corps' jurisdictional

3

determination would have upon themselves, the recipients

4

and the intended audience.

5

jurisdictional determination indicating that the Corps

6

believes there are waters of the United States on the

7

Property will force them to choose among three

8

unattractive options:

9

which could be an expensive process and wouldn't be by

And they say the

One, would be seeking a permit

10

any means certain to succeed; the second would be

11

discharging pollutants, discharging fill onto the

12

Property and taking their chances in a future

13

enforcement action; and the third would be playing it

14

safe, forgoing development entirely.

15

And the problem with Respondents' argument

16

is that that choice would have existed before the

17

jurisdictional determination was issued.

18

existed if the Corps had never adopted its practice of

19

issuing jurisdictional determinations upon request.

20

It's simply a choice that is posed by the Clean Water

21

Act.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

It would have

If there were a provision of

23

law saying that a jurisdictional determination by the

24

Corps or by the EPA is binding on the federal government

25

in future litigation, would that be reviewable?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

MR. STEWART:

I think if the ­­ if the

2

statute said that, we would have a very different case,

3

because in that case we would have something much closer

4

to Bennett v. Spear.

5

In Bennett v. Spear, the Corps ­­ the Court

6

was dealing with a biological opinion issued by one

7

Federal agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service to another

8

Federal agency, the Bureau of Reclamation, and it

9

included an incidental take statement.

And the terms

10

and conditions of the incidental take statement affected

11

the legal options that were available to the Bureau of

12

Reclamation.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it would be a

14

different case, but are you able to say whether that

15

would be reviewable under the EPA?

16

MR. STEWART:

Yes.

I think if the ­­ if the

17

Corps' jurisdictional determination were legally binding

18

upon the EPA, if it foreclosed the possibility of an

19

enforcement ­­ of an EPA enforcement action that was

20

inconsistent with the terms of the jurisdictional

21

determination, yes, we think that the JD would be

22

judicially reviewable.

23

But I think it's important to ­­ to point

24

out how far removed that is from the actual statute

25

before us.

That is ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me just ask about

2

how far removed it is.

3

certainly is true, but there is a Memorandum of

4

Understanding between the Army and the EPA, and it says,

5

quote, "case­specific determinations" ­­ and I think

6

that includes jurisdictional determinations ­­ "made

7

pursuant to the terms of this Memorandum of

8

Understanding will be binding on the government and

9

represent the government's position and any subsequent

10

There is no such statute, that

Federal action or litigation regarding the case."

11

So is your ­­ would your argument be that

12

because this is in a Memorandum of Understanding as

13

opposed to a statute or a regulation, the situation is

14

different, and that is insufficient to make the

15

jurisdictional determination reviewable?

16

MR. STEWART:

That would be one argument,

17

but the other argument, and I think we've made this

18

point in the reply brief, that particular Memorandum of

19

Understanding was dealing with what are referred to as

20

"special case determinations."

21

There are ­­ situations occasionally arise

22

where the agencies perceive at the outset that there

23

could be dicey questions.

24

coverage on which the Corps and EPA might disagree.

25

since 19 ­­

There could be questions of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I don't ­­ I'm

2

sorry to stop you right there, but I don't think that's

3

right.

4

says in Section 2 ­­ no, I'm sorry, (4)(C)(ii), it

5

describes nonspecial cases.

6

projects not involving a special case, the DE" ­­ in

7

other words, the district engineer, the Army Corps, not

9

communicate those determinations without a requirement

10

I'm looking at the Memorandum as well, and it

It says, "For those

11

So while it talks about the division of

12

authority between special cases and the mine­run cases,

13

it certainly says something about nonspecial cases.

14

That's what Section 2 is titled "Nonspecial Cases."

15

MR. STEWART:

But ­­ but we understand the

16

language about the ultimate determination being binding

21

2

that's not within Bennett's second prong.

3

MR. STEWART:

You think that

It's not within Bennett's

4

second prong in the same way that in Franklin v.

5

Massachusetts that ­­ the practice of the President had

6

always been to transmit the figures and do the

apportionment in accordance with the figures that were

8

prepared by the Secretary of Commerce.

9

said what mattered was there ­­ there was no legal ­­

10

But the Court

legally binding obligation on the President to do that.

11

I would also say that independent of the

12

possibility of an EPA enforcement action, there is a

13

more realistic possibility of a private citizen suit.

14

The fact that the Corps concludes that jurisdictional

15

waters are not present wouldn't preclude a citizen suit

16

from being filed challenging that premise of the

17

discharge activity ­­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the question

19

is, I think, whether it's final with respect to the

20

Corps' determination, not with respect to whether

21

somebody else might be able to bring a suit, and ­­ and

22

I think what Justice Sotomayor is suggesting is that in

23

practice and, what I was suggesting, in law is it's

24

final with respect to the Corps.

MR. STEWART:

presents new information, if the ­­ if in the course of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it seems to me

what you are arguing, then, is that there are exceptions
to what is otherwise a safe harbor.
MR. STEWART:

It's ­­ it's not intended to

12

be ­­ first of all, the jurisdictional determination

13

that we're talking about here, the one that's actually

14

being challenged, was one that concluded that

jurisdictional waters were present.

that sort of jurisdictional determination has no binding

effect on anyone.

The landowner is still legally free

will be a different ruling later on down the road.

The other alternative that the ­­ the

20

proceeding in which Standard Oil was charged with

phrase was reason to ­­ to believe.

I would have dissented ­­ is intended to overrule what I

9

think is the great case on the matter, which is Abbott

10

So I would assume that nothing in Bennett ­­ or

Labs.

11

And Harlan, in Abbott Labs, explains

12

completely and thoroughly what this Court has done in

13

Frozen Food Express, what the Court did in Storer.

14

on the point you're now making, what he says

15

specifically is the ICC order is right for review, even

16

though it would have no effect until later.

17

18

And

Someone

He says that in Storer, the Commission,

19

policy determination is ripe, even though it would not

20

issue a television license ­­ that's what the policy

21

said ­­ even though no specific application was before

22

the court.

23

So it wouldn't take effect until later.
And the same thing is true precisely of the

24

order in Abbott Labs itself.

25

interpreting what the Commission would do, and nothing

It was a statement of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14
1

was going to happen.

2

somebody decided to violate it.

3

even if they violated it, nothing would happen, unless

4

the Commission decided to prosecute.

5

Nothing happened, unless later on
Much like this.

And

So what Justice Ginsburg said was, once this

6

is in effect, okay, now what happens?

7

subject to it has to take certain steps because of the

8

law.

9

fail, or two, do nothing, violate it, and possibly go to

The person who is

One, spend $150,000 to try to get an exception and

10

11

that flow from an order that, in respect to the Agency,

12

is final, for it has nothing left to do about that

13

interpretation.

14
15
16

Those sound like important legal consequences

And B, is perfectly suited for review in the
courts.
So we have harm flowing from a change in

17

legal relations, we have an agency that has nothing left

18

to do on this particular matter, and we have a court

19

that is perfectly suited to review it.

20

flows from Abbott Labs, almost QED.

21

what is your response to that?

22

MR. STEWART:

I would say it

So what is your ­­

Well, with respect to Abbott

23

Labs specifically ­­ excuse me ­­ Abbott Labs dealt with

24

a regulation that essentially required that on each

25

instance where the ­­ the trade name of the drug

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

15

appeared, including it on the labeling, the generic name

2

of the drug had to appear as well.

And the regulation, as rules typically do,

was phrased as a ­­ as a directive.

7

It said

It was a legal ­­ legal

8

said in various contexts, we have held that regulations

9

are immediately reviewable as final agency action,

10

although the court engages in a separate ripeness

11

discussion.

12

The second thing I would say about Bennett

13

is the Bennett court, I think, was quite careful not to

14

rest its decision on the practical impact that the order

15

would have on the recipient.

16

the fact that the biological opinion constrained the

17

legal obligation options available to the Bureau of

18

Reclamation, because only by complying with the FWS's

19

terms and conditions could the Bureau of Reclamation get

20

the immunity from Endangered Species Act liability that

21

it wanted.

22

It rested its decision on

The third thing I would say, and to return

23

to my prior point about FTC v. Standard Oil, it happens

24

a lot in the law that we are confronted with a situation

25

like this, where a particular government decision is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

16
1

made.

2

that denies a motion to dismiss for lack of subject

3

matter jurisdiction or for failure to State a claim on

4

the merits, and the losing party, the person who

5

disagrees with the order, says I should be able to get

6

immediate review of this because if I don't get

7

immediate review, then even if I'm vindicated at the end

8

of the day, I will be put to substantial burden and

9

expense in the meantime.

Be it an agency order, a district court order

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Stewart, may I ask

11

you, please don't panic by asking this question.

12

please don't resist it, because I know all your

13

arguments resisting it.

14

you that that should be appealable, what's the narrowest

15

way to right this that the government would like?

16

MR. STEWART:

And

But assuming we disagree with

I guess if the ­­ if the Court

17

ruled against us on the ground that it understood the

18

EPA and the Corps to have entered into a binding

19

agreement, such that the EPA would be foreclosed from

20

taking action based on its disagreement with the Corps'

21

jurisdictional determination, I ­­ I think if that were

22

the gravamen of the opinion, it would be one that if the

23

agencies wanted to fix it, they easily could, simply by

24

issuing a new MOA clarifying their view of the ­­ the

25

JD's effect.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, on the same lines,

2

could I ask more generally?

of how this program compares to various other kinds of

14

whatever, how this program compares to those and where

15

you could draw sensible lines, because mostly we want

this helps people, to actually know what the government

part of the ­­ the difficulty I have with your question

is ­­ or I should say I think if you were drawing lines,

fairly far removed from anything that ought to be

judicially reviewable, because in many of the instances,

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I think ­­ I think

12

underlying Justice Kagan's question is that the Clean

13

Water Act is unique in both being quite vague in its

14

reach, arguably unconstitutionally vague, and certainly

15

harsh in the civil and criminal sanctions it puts into

16

practice.

17

What's the closest analogous statute that

18

gives the affected party so little guidance at the front

19

end?

20

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think with respect to

21

the vast majority of sites in this country, it's readily

22

apparent whether the Clean Water Act applies; that is ­­

23

and this point is somewhat removed from the actual facts

24

of this case, but it happens all the time that at

25

construction sites around the country, industrial

Alderson Reporting Company

19
1

parties will dig up a lot of dirt and deposit it

2

somewhere else.

3

be illegal if it occurred in waters of the

4

United States, but nobody thinks there's a problem,

5

because in the vast bulk of its ­­ in the vast bulk of

6

locations, there really isn't a quandary.

7

And they're doing something that would

And if you imagine a statute that said

8

before you can do anything like that, you have to come

9

to the Corps and get advance assurance that these are

10

not waters of the United States, it would be

11

exponentially more burdensome.

12

I take your point that there are certainly a

13

significant range of tracks where the application of the

14

The first part of the permitting process,

that, can the landowner get judicial review if the

your view, with the entire ­­ all the rest of the

11

MR. STEWART:

I think it would still have to

and part of the point for that is it ­­ it may be that

And I guess I want to know what's different

16

about this than any of the other cases in which the

17

Federal government does that.

18

people want to know these things.

19

MR. HOPPER:

For good reason.

Because

What you're describing, Your

20

Honor, is what is ­­ what we ­­ would be referred to in

21

this case as a preliminary jurisdictional determination.

22

The regulatory process has built into it the option of

23

an advisory, informational, preliminary jurisdictional

24

determination to be issued to the applicant that is

25

nothing more than advisory.

It's not binding and can't

So, you know, just as you say, this

7

basically says to us we were in the clear if we passed

8

this.

So do these letters.

9

MR. HOPPER:

That is strong language, Your

10

Honor, but not as strong as an adjudicative

11

determination, where rights and obligations are actually

12

decided.

13

In ­­ in this particular case, the process

14

is so formalized, and ­­ and purports to be final, and

15

purports to be binding, that it ­­ that's ­­ that it's

16

quite distinguishable from the situation that you are

17

describing.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let me ask you about that,

19

because that's certainly ­­ this ­­ this process does

20

last a long time, and it's ­­ even Mr. Stewart, I think,

21

would say this is a more formal process than many that

22

are ­­ that exist around the Federal government.

23

But I guess I'm wondering about the

24

incentives of the kind of distinction that you would

25

make.

Because it would suggest, you know, that agencies

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

30
1

should not ­­ should draw back, should not give a fully

2

informed view, should not do the fact­finding that the

3

board ­­ that that ­­ the Corps does here.

4

should ­­ should just make their processes less formal,

5

but in ­­ in making their processes less formal, also

6

less accurate and less helpful.

7
8

You know,

And I guess I wonder who that benefits in
the end.

9

MR. HOPPER:

Well, I think that the Agency

10

has more to lose than the landowner has to gain by

11

refraining from issuing these kind of formal

12

adjudications.

They indicate that they issue about

13

54,000 permits.

And most of ­­ and they ­­ 54,000

14

nationwide permits and about 3,100 individual permits,

15

and of those, only eight have ever been appealed

16

administratively.

17

So there's really no incentive for the ­­

18

for the government here to draw back on this formal

19

adjudicative process, because in almost all cases, the

20

landowner is simply going to defer to the Agency on

21

jurisdiction.

22

you.

23

And that ­­ that would be my response to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess I don't quite

24

understand that, because it seems as though they could

25

make it less formal, and they could provide less

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

31
1

assurance, and ­­ and still, there would be very few

2

people who would want to run the gauntlet.

3

And so you wouldn't gain anything.

All you

4

would do was to lose something, and what you lose is

5

accurate, reliable information provided to people about

6

whether, in fact, these waters are ­­ fall within the

7

Clean Water Act.

8

MR. HOPPER:

Well ­­ well, that's the

9

problem, because until there has been ­­ because the ­­

10

the Clean Water Act is so difficult to ­­ because under

11

the Clean Water Act, it is so difficult to determine,

12

the reach of the Act, and it can only be done through

13

expert analysis, you would never get the kind of

14

detailed, reliable information that would define the

15

scope of jurisdiction if you didn't have such a formal

16

process, which would never occur in the type of

17

generalized ruling that you've suggested, like through

18

the preliminary JD.

19

The preliminary JD says we think you may

20

have waters of the United States on your property.

21

approved jurisdictional JD says just the opposite:

22

We've made a definitive determination; you can rely on

23

that; you're obligated to get a permit, and you have a

24

right to use property that is not subject to the waters

25

of the United States.

of rule that you want, simply decline to give

7

MR. HOPPER:

All that's required in order to

receive a jurisdictional determination under the

regulatory guideline is to ask.

And under the ­­ the

regulatory guideline, the Agency is required to respond.

MR. HOPPER:

Exactly.
Well, that seems to be a

good reason for Mr. Stewart to prevail in this case.

It does more than that.

The JD

JUSTICE KAGAN:

is whether there's any obligation or whether there's ­­

it's simply information about what will happen given

MR. HOPPER:

The Clean Water Act itself

doesn't say anything about this particular property.

And the ­­ the Clean Water Act doesn't cover all waters.

is to go through this laborious site­specific

analysis ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That seems right.

also why people go to the Treasury Department for tax

advice about what they can and cannot do with respect to

MR. HOPPER:

those examples having an appeals process that results in

a final Agency action, that by treatment and regulation

4

and practice constitute a binding conclusion.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the premise of the

6

question is that the Army Corps of Engineers is doing

7

this just out of the goodness of its heart; that this is

8

a lot of work for them but they just want to be nice to

9

landowners and that's why they've set up this ­­ this

10
11

process.
And maybe that's correct, although I

12

understood what you were saying earlier to suggest that

13

that's not quite how you see the process; that they do

14

this for their own purposes because they ­­ it expands

15

their enforcement power, because landowners who have a

16

question about the status of their land have strong

17

incentive to ask for a jurisdictional determination.

18

And if ­­ so that alerts the Corps to the

19

fact that this is a property that might be subject to

20

their jurisdiction.

21

sorry ­­ an affirmative jurisdictional determination as

22

a practical matter, that's going to mean in most

your answer would be is that informal advice is not

final Agency action normally.

12

There is a statute.

It was passed in 1946.

13

It's called the Administrative Procedures Act.

14

to divide such things with that word, "final," as

15

rulemaking by the Agency, from accomplishing roughly the

16

same result by never having a rule but just telling

17

everybody informally what the Agency will do in such

circumstances.

19

things being equal, final Agency action in respect to

It tries

It might be that the formal is, other

So I think what you're telling me is what I

should do next is go read those Federal rules and

or is it more like formal rulemaking?

mind, we would refer you to Frozen Food, which you've

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, yeah.

I mean, if

Frozen Food, Storer and Abbott Labs, and Bennett too,

are examples of what falls on the formal final side of

the line.

And let me also make a comparison between

2

this and ­­ and Sackett, when this Court considered

3

whether double penalties would apply in that case.

4

You might recall that during oral argument,

5

Mr. Stewart said that with respect to double penalties,

6

that is, there ­­ there will be $37,500 a day assessed

7

because of ­­ of violation of the statute, and then

8

$37,500 a day because of a violation of the compliance

order.

He said that ­­ that that reading of the law was

12

Here, we ­­ we don't have a ­­ a theoretical

So even though you're right, a simple letter

We have an actual risk.

The ­­ the Clean Water

19

may put one on notice, it certainly doesn't have the

20

same weight as a final binding determination.

21

The main problems we have with the

22

requirement of going through a permit process before one

23

can seek judicial review under the APA are fourfold.

24
25

First of all, the permit process adds
nothing to the jurisdictional question.

Alderson Reporting Company

It doesn't add

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

46
1

any facts which are relevant, and it doesn't clarify the

2

law.

It is simply an idle act which the law abhors.

3

Secondly, it puts the ­­ the timing of the

4

judicial review entirely in the hands of the Agency.

5

is an open­ended invitation to the Agency to delay

6

forever the ­­ the final permit issuance, denying the

landowner a right to ever have judicial review.
