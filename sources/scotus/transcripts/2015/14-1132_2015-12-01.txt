Mr. Hacker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. HACKER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. HACKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

In language that differs distinctly from the

12

"arising under" language of Section 1331, Exchange Act

13

Section 27 confers on the Federal courts exclusive

14

jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty

15

created by the Exchange Act and its regulations.

16

language establishes a straightforward test.

17

That

The Federal court has exclusive jurisdiction

18

if the suit is brought to enforce Exchange Act duties

19

even if the suit is also brought to enforce State law

20

duties.

21

In particular, the words "brought to

22

enforce" focus on what the plaintiff itself wants the

23

court to decide, not on what the court would necessarily

24

have to decide, as 1331 has been read to require.

25

By applying the 1331 test, the Third Circuit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

not only ignored Section 27's distinct language but also

2

its distinct policies, which strongly disfavor State

3

court adjudication of Exchange Act duties and thus are

4

exactly the opposite of the policies favoring State

5

court adjudication that underlie the Jackson Pollock

6

canvas this Court has painted over Section 1331.

7

Respondents, however, begin not with the

8

necessity rule derived from 1331 but with a much more

9

aggressive position that Section 27 only creates

10

jurisdiction over causes of action created by the

11

Exchange Act itself and thus categorically bars

12

jurisdiction over State­based causes of action like

13

those asserted here.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, does your ­­ does your

15

test depend solely on what is alleged in the complaint

16

or what might be proven under a ­­ a more generally

17

worded complaint?

18

Suppose the complaint in this case made no

19

reference to any Federal regulations but ­­ I'm not that

20

familiar with the pleading rules in New Jersey, but

21

suppose they would ­­ it was, you know, notice pleading

22

23

3

end, the answer is no.

5

would not be seeking to enforce an Exchange Act duty.

If the rule in New Jersey is the

The answer to the first part of your

7

question is yes, which is our test does look at the

8

allegations on the face of the complaint:

by the Exchange Act?

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So they could amend the

12

complaint, and then we wouldn't be here, because they

13

could amend the complaint to say that we're suing under

14

New Jersey law and New Jersey law mirrors the Federal

15

law.

16

It's a matter of New Jersey's choice.
MR. HACKER:

The way I would put it is we

17

wouldn't have been here if they had written that

18

complaint to start with, but because removal ­­

19

jurisdiction is tested at the time of removal, if they

20

amended their complaint now, it wouldn't change the fact

21

that there's Federal jurisdiction based on the face of

22

the complaint at the time of the ­­ of removal.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, is the Court

24

obligated to do a search of all Federal laws and

25

regulations to know if this complaint might have a

Federal cause of action?
MR. HACKER:

No.

Section 27 jurisdiction because it's ­­

12

Federal statute under which ­­ not 1331 but the specific

13

Federal statute that creates the duty, or do they just

14

allege the duty?

MR. HACKER:

Can you just tell me as a

forth the ­­ the statute under which they're pleading.

21

They're identifying the duty so that the Court

22

understands what the nature of the claim is.

23

very common precisely because you don't want the Court

24

to go looking around for the cause of action, especially

25

after Twombly and Iqbal.

Alderson Reporting Company

That's

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But they ­­ but they don't

2

have to do that.

3

don't have to explicitly refer to the Federal statute.

4

As ­­ as I understand your case, they

MR. HACKER:

That's ­­ that's right in a

5

limited sense that ­­ I think this Court would recognize

6

and has recognized inartful pleading doctrine where, for

7

example ­­ if you use this complaint as an example, if

8

they had just literally whited out, deleted the

9

references to Reg SHO as such but were clearly

10

unambiguously pleading violations of its requirements

11

with the same capital L, Locate, capital C, Close­Out

12

requirements, you would unmistakably understand the

13

complaint to be based on violations of the Act ­­ of the

14

Exchange Act regulation seeking to enforce those duties.

15

Then sure, the fact you didn't cite it wouldn't change

16

the fact.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that imposes quite

18

a ­­ quite an onerous task upon ­­ upon the Federal

19

district court, it seems to me.

20

through the complaint and see if any of the claimed

21

causes of action under State law mirror a cause of

22

action that happens to exist under Federal law, without

23

even the hint that they mention the Federal statute.

24

MR. HACKER:

You ­­ you have to sift

is no indication that Congress clearly intended such an

4

unprecedented intrusion on State court authority.

5
6
7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There

Why do you think, Mr. Stris,

this different language was used in these ten statutes?
MR. STRIS:

So my ­­ my best answer is to

8

mirror, essentially, what our amici public citizen and

9

the State securities regulators have said, which is at

10

the time that certainly the '33 Act and the '34 Act were

11

passed, the Federal question statute had an

12

amount­in­controversy requirement.

13

Now, I understand that my friend, Mr.

14

Hacker, points out in his reply that there's a current

15

statute, 28 U.S.C. 1337, that was enacted in 1948.

16

had a predecessor statute, 28 U.S.C. 41(8) that was

17

enacted in 1911 that removed the amount­in­controversy

18

requirement for cases involving interstate commerce.

19

It

And one would think, because it's the case

20

today, that that would apply to securities.

21

we can understand from our research, in the years that

22

are relevant, 1911 to the time of the '33 Act and '34

23

Act, it was not interpreted that way.

24
25

But as best

So there was essentially an
amount­in­controversy requirement for securities cases.

something like that?

10

MR. STRIS:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. STRIS:

Well ­­
Or even less?

If we're attempting to ascertain

13

why Congress would choose to use this language instead

14

of other language, I would submit that any

15

amount­in­controversy requirement, if they felt they

16

didn't want that for purposes of Federally­created

17

claims ­­ so this is going to segue into my first

18

point ­­ we think the most natural reading of Section 27

is as a creation test.

20

That ­­ why ­­ that doesn't explain

MR. STRIS:

No, no.

But I think it does.

21

So ­­ so this particular statutory language is found in

22

eleven statutes.

23

"exclusive jurisdiction"; in ­­ in others, they did not.

24
25

In some of them, they used the term

What follows exclusive jurisdiction is
essentially a creation test that ­­ which I'll explain

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34

in a moment.

2

exclusive jurisdiction here just means that, when there

3

was a cause of action that was created by the

4

Exchange Act, they wanted it to be in Federal court.

5

The fact that they chose to confer

So ­­ so let me ­­ let me get to the spirit

6

of ­­ of the answer, which is why I think that there's

7

good reason to believe that exclusive jurisdiction in

8

the statute is limited to causes of action that are

9

created by the Act itself.

10

So my friend Mr. Hacker concedes, I think

11

reasonably, that if someone sues under a parallel State

12

duty, that that is only a duty under ­­ that's a lawsuit

13

that's brought to enforce only a duty under State law.

14

I was pleased to hear that, because I think that is the

15

most natural reading of ­­ of the language.

16

Our position is that the result is no

17

different if a State accomplishes the same thing through

18

the expedience of incorporating or referencing Federal

19

law.

20

And I want to be clear on this point.

Our

21

position is not that the plain meaning of the statute

22

compels that interpretation.

23

that one could theoretically read the ­­ the language

24

brought to enforce a liability or duty created by the

25

Act or its regulations the way that my ­­ my friend

I'll be the first to say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35

suggests.

2

down and not really make much sense if we look at what's

3

missing from Section 27.

One could.

4

But I think it starts to break

Here's what's missing:

There is no Federal

5

jurisdiction over Exchange Act counterclaims, which

6

means that State court ­­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MR. STRIS:

9

counterclaims.

Over ­­

I'm sorry.

Over Exchange Act

So that means that Congress was willing

10

to have State courts adjudicate claims that were created

11

by the Act itself.

12

There is no exclusive jurisdiction over

13

Exchange Act defenses.

14

include preemption.

15

cases ­­ and I'm going to get to this in a little bit ­­

16

not only is the State court determining what the

17

Exchange Act says, but it's doing it for the purpose of

18

assessing whether there is a conflict between State and

19

Federal law.

20

And most notably, that would

And in the mine­run of preemption

It's really important that those two things

21

are missing from the statute, because I find it very

22

difficult to believe that a Congress that was not

23

concerned about State courts adjudicating those cases

24

somehow would be very concerned about a State court

25

adjudicating a State law­created cause of action that

in context, I think it just ­­

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

mind a certain category of claims that it did not want

12

adjudicated in State court are only these:

13

which the plaintiff is asking for the enforcement of a

14

Federal duty, and there is no comparable State duty at

15

that time, and the State court is unwilling to recognize

16

a comparable State duty in the context of that

17

litigation.

18

Those in

So these are essentially cases in which the

19

State is basically hostile to the Federal duty.

20

those are the only cases that Congress did not want to

21

have adjudicated in State court.

22

Am I ­­ have you gone wrong in that?

23

MR. STRIS:

And

I ­­ I don't think you've gone

24

wrong, but I think that that position is firmly

25

supported by history, if we look at the context.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And let me explain what I mean.

2

So at the time the Exchange Act was passed,

3

there were only three express rights of action, and they

4

were very minor.

5

under 10(b); there was a market manipulation of a 9(a),

6

short­swing profits; and a third one that I don't

7

recall.

8
9

There was no private right of action

So if we look at the context, we have a
history of States regulating securities.

We have a

10

parallel provision in the Exchange Act, Section 28, that

11

this Court in Matsushita acknowledged, expressly

12

endorsed the fact that States were going to continue to

13

regulate.

14

So I think the Congress that passed the '34

15

Act was thinking the following:

16

have a very narrow window of claims that are created by

17

this Act.

18

manipulation claim, for ­­ for ­­ for wash sales.

19

don't want State courts adjudicating those, because

20

those are very technical.

21

jurisdiction over those claims.

22
23

They were thinking we

And for those, a 9(a) straightforward market
We

We want exclusive

And I think that's the extent of what
Congress intended in passing this provision.

24

Now ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Supposing that you had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

brought this claim specifically to enjoin violations of

2

this SHO regulation.

3

please enjoin the defendant from violating SHO.

4

So that's your complaint.

MR. STRIS:

Court,

Well, I think as a factual

5

matter, Justice Ginsburg, that couldn't happen because

6

the conduct would have already occurred.

7

resist the hypothetical.

8
9

But I won't

I think ­­ I think the hypothetical you're
asking reveals the most difficult part of our plain­text

10

interpretation, which is assume a State statute that

11

seeks to enjoin what is only a federally­created duty.

12

I don't know that that would come up, but it could,

13

theoretically.

14

Our position would be that that is still

15

best interpreted as a lawsuit brought to enforce a duty

16

or a liability created by State law, because the ­­ the

17

State has decided by reference to have the duty being

18

don't violate the ­­ the ­­ the Federal standard that

19

you would get the injunction for.

20

And I think, in the real world, what we're

21

seeing are, at best, States that are creating parallel

22

provisions that incorporate duties and liabilities

23

merely because it's an expedient.

24

that ­­ I guess before I move on ­­ you know,

25

administrative simplicity is a ­­ is a major virtue in

And so I think

that before.

3

Section 27 as anything other than a creation test, I

4

think that's the best result.

In other words, Mr. Hacker has a

So if you had to describe

10

your complaint, and particularly, what role does this

11

regulation play in your claims under State law?

12

MR. STRIS:

13

So I think there's been some

14

misunderstanding of what we're alleging.

15

relying on Reg SHO for any theory of liability, and

16

here's why:

17

market­manipulation claim.

18

suggesting that the naked short­selling that happened

19

was not just a technical infraction, not just a

20

technical violation of Reg SHO, but was done with the

21

purpose of depressing sales prices ­­ or prices of the

22

security.

23

I understand, Justice Kagan.

We are not

We're bringing a straight­up
And what that means is we're

That's an analogue to a 10b­5 action.
And so if we look at paragraph 30 of our

24

complaint ­­ this is on pages 53­A to ­­ to 54­A ­­ we

25

make clear that the relevant provision of New Jersey law

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

is substantially similar to the Federal securities law.

2

We're referring to 10(b).

When ­­ when the

3

Uniform Securities Act was promulgated in 1956,

4

Section 101, which New Jersey adopted, mirrors 10(b).

5

If you're going to bring a claim under

6

Federal law, you're not suing under Reg SHO.

7

Manipulative short­selling existed well before Reg SHO.

8

It's a standard.

taking a short position.

You're basically saying someone is

say that any time you talk about someone doing something

about I can't clarify in my mind the difference between

necessary ­­ the Federal issue is necessary for the

my conclusion, but you see, it's ­­ it's ­­ I ­­ I need

2

clarification, because I'm not sure I've thought it

3

through correctly.

4

MR. STRIS:

So here ­­ here's my best

5

attempt to clarify.

I think ­­ let me throw away the

6

facts for a minute.

In other words, I think there's no

7

theory that we've pled that satisfies even their

8

standard, but let me throw that away.

9

best case for them, that we've relied on Federal duties

Let me assume the

10

and try and put it through those ­­ the ­­ the ­­ the

11

legal question that you've asked.

12

I think one way to resolve this is to take

13

the simple approach, which is what I advocated first,

14

and to say, look, if it's just enforcing a State law

15

cause of action, even if it incorporates Federal law,

16

that's all 27 does, and you're done.

17

premise of your question is let's say you've rejected

18

that, and we're thinking, you know what, maybe some

19

State­law claims fall within the sweep of Section 27;

20

how do we think about this?

21

Here's what I would say.

I understand the

I would say that

22

whether this is an arising under statute or not, it has

23

to incorporate what I'll call a Federal necessity

24

requirement, because that's a longstanding rule that's

25

part and parcel of the well­pleaded complaint rule.

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

47
1

if you look at Pan American, for example.

2

accept what my friend Mr. Hacker says that it's dicta,

3

they weren't saying it's an arising under statute, they

4

applied ­­ this Court applied the well­pleaded complaint

5

rule without looking at the text of the statute at all.

6

It's a sensible thing to say that when Federal

7

jurisdiction over State­law claims is predicated on the

8

Federal character, there being a Federal issue, that we

9

use the well­pleaded complaint rule.

10

Let's say I

It's also similarly sensible that the

11

well­pleaded complaint rule would have an adjunct which

12

is Federal necessity, and that's precisely what the

13

Court said in Christianson.

14

"The well­pleaded complaint rule focuses on claims, not

15

theories, and just because an element that's essential

16

to a particular theory might be governed by Federal

17

patent law does not mean the entire monopolization claim

18

arises under patent law."

19

And I'll quote the Court:

Now, to the second half of your question,

20

which is, well, how does that ­­ how do they map

21

24

That ­­ that's how ­­ that's how

17

And so as to the general rule, here are my

18

thoughts.

19

and we can call it Jackson Pollock all we want, but it's

20

been adopted, it exists, and it's applied by courts.

21

I think that there is a very small distinction between

22

incorporating it here or not.

23

exclusivity versus ­­ versus nonexclusivity, I

24

understand that; but my point is the simplest way of out

25

this morass, I think, is to say we want a simple,

The ­­ 1331 still exists.

1331 is powerful,

So

There is a distinction,

Alderson Reporting Company

50

administratable rule and we only look to 27 to confer

2

jurisdiction over Exchange Act­created claims, and we

3

have, as a backdrop, 1331.

4

Now, if you resist that, Justice Breyer, and

5

you don't like that and you say, okay, well, what's the

6

second­best option?

7

and I don't really need to advocate one as opposed to

8

the other because we win under both, but I'll throw them

9

out there.

10

There ­­ there's ­­ there's two,

One is to say we don't have to call this an

11

arising under statute.

12

difficult question of, well, was ­­ was that what Pan

American was holding; did they ­­ did Congress intend to

14

15

There ­­ there's a simple way out, which is to say the

that you were saying ­­ does not inhere in the words

language ought to be interpreted in the same way as

14

arising under jurisdiction is interpreted.

15

true they're different words, but it's at least as good

16

an interpretation of these words that they essentially

17

refer to what the arising under test refers to, which

reading of the language, and consistent with the

9

history, I actually don't think it's adopting arising

10

under, but I certainly could defend it as a reasonable

11

interpretation of the language in the context.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

So in light of SLUSA, the

13

issue that's before us would apply only in individual

14

actions and small class actions?

15

MR. STRIS:

That's ­­ that's exactly right.

16

And I think maybe I'll ­­ maybe I'll close with this.

17

think that's very important from the perspective of just

18

sensibility and policy, which is the following.

19

I

One of the things that ­­ that animated the

20

Private Securities Litigation Reform Act was the concern

21

that lawyers were driving litigation and not clients.

22

And that's why, for example, one of the things that went

23

into the PSLRA was a requirement of who the most

24

appropriate plaintiff is.

25

have cases like this, when you have the CEO of a company

That doesn't happen when you

2

And so not only was it not the point of

3

Congress in 1933 and 1934 to invade the province of

4

State courts, if we look at the entire history of

5

purposes and ­­ and Congress trying to say, well, we

6

have some concerns about what State courts are doing,

7

there has never been an express concern about State

8

courts enforcing State law in individual actions like

9

this one.

10

For the Court to hold otherwise would be

11

unprecedented because you would be stripping State

12

courts of the type of jurisdiction that they've had

13

since the time of the Exchange Act.

14

Exchange Act itself was predicated on common law deceit

15

and fraud and a whole history of what was occurring in

16

State courts.

17

read Section 27 that's workable from the Court's

18

jurisdictional precedents, but it's also sensible in

19

terms of what the dual system of securities regulation

20

is trying to do.

I think we have every right to do that as ­­ as the

19

master of our complaint.

2

Any act of market manipulation in the

3

context of naked short selling will necessarily violate

4

Regulation SHO, but every violation of Regulation SHO is

5

not market manipulation.

6

What Regulation SHO does is it sets a floor.

7

And if you engage in certain conduct, you ­­ you short a

Section 9(d)

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HACKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Respondents' argument has a problem with

13

the language, both of their own complaint and with the

14

language of the statute.

15

The complaint could not be clearer that,

16

while it's true there are references to market

17

manipulation, what they're trying to establish is market

18

manipulation by the mere fact that there were not

19

shares and caused their problems.

clear in those paragraphs, and through the rest of the

9

complaint.

10

But the whole point of ­­ of the complaint

It's perfectly

I don't think there's any ambiguity

whatsoever.

11

Nor is there ambiguity in the plain text of

12

the statute.

13

effectively incorporates the Holmesian view that it has

14

to be a cause of action created by the Act itself.

15

The first argument they make is that it

The ­­ Section 27 answers that question.

It

doesn't say that jurisdiction is established for ­­ over

would have been the way that Congress would have said

19

it.

20

causes of action established by the Act, Congress would

21

have said that.

22

it said was very much essentially the opposite or

23

something very different, which is suits brought to

22

with that.

25

But let me turn to the last point,
Justice Breyer's argument and I think Justice Kagan's,

that, well, maybe it's just the same thing as 1331.

2

That too is contrary to the text of the statute because

3

1331 has been construed ­­ it also doesn't have the

4

textual requirement ­­ as having this necessity

5

component precisely because if you don't have a

6

necessity component, then you're taking away from State

7

courts cases that State courts are competent to

8

adjudicate.

9

We know that Congress had literally the

10

opposite premise here, that they didn't want State

11

courts adjudicating, as Respondents' counsel's conceded,

12

a certain class of cases.

What class of cases is that?
