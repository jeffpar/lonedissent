United States.

Mr. Zas.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD S. ZAS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ZAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case concerns the ten­year mandatory

12

minimum prison sentence that Section 2252(b)(2)

13

sometimes requires Federal judges to impose.

14

The statutory language in dispute reserves

15

the severe punishment for a defendant with a prior State

16

conviction for an offense relating to any kind of sexual

17

abuse involving a minor or ward.

18

prior offense did not involve a minor or ward, the

19

statute's mandatory minimum penalty does not apply to

20

him.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because Petitioner's

Suppose the conviction

22

had been, under Federal law, the ­­ the conviction for

23

sexual abuse of an adult and we have the same question:

24

Does the mandatory minimum apply?

25

I take it if it had been under Federal law,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

then the mandatory minimum would apply.

2

MR. ZAS:

That's correct.

If the conviction

3

had been under Chapter 109A of Title XVIII, which covers

4

sexual abuse offenses, then it would trigger the

5

mandatory penalty.

6

the time it was first enacted in 1978, has never sought

7

to create symmetry or parity between the Federal

8

predicates and the State predicates.

But Congress, in this statute, since

9

This may be most clear now in

10

Subsection 2252(b)(1), where you can see that a prior

11

Federal conviction for sex trafficking of anyone, which

12

is a violation of Section 1591, the corresponding State

13

analogue, is textually limited to sex trafficking of

14

children.

15

So this decision to treat prior State and

16

Federal predicates differently is inescapable, and it's

17

been true ever since the first statute.

18

So from 1970 ­­

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I ­­ I don't ­­ why ­­ why

20

is it in this case ­­ it ­­ it does seem to me that

21

Congress, eight years later, when it wrote the ­­ the

22

second statute, used the ­­ the ­­ the same style and

23

that this very much favors the government.

24

say that that's inapplicable, because?

25

MR. ZAS:

But then you

Because when this language was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

first added ­­ first, it was added in 1994.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

MR. ZAS:

4

Yes.

The Federal predicates.

At that

time there were still no State law predicates at all.

5

In 1996, when the language was first

6

introduced, and it was then introduced in Section ­­

7

Subsection (b)(1), which applies to the distribution and

8

receipt offenses, even then the penalty for simple

9

possession of child pornography was the only Federal

10

predicate.

11

So someone in Mr. Lockhart's position at

12

that time would not have faced the mandatory minimum

13

penalty even if people who ­­ who committed the

14

distribution offenses would or even if ­­ even if he had

15

a conviction for ­­ under Chapter 109A.

16

So ­­ and then in 1998, when this language

17

in dispute was then added at the government's urging to

18

Subsection (b)(2), even at that time Congress clearly

19

wasn't aiming for parity because then they added a new

20

Federal predicate, Chapter 117 offenses, which are

21

violations of the Man Act:

22

sexual activity.

23
24
25

Transportation for illegal

But at that time it didn't add any State
law ­­ State offense analogue for that offense.
This has continued up to the present day.

Alderson Reporting Company

So in 2003, there were amendments to add the obscenity

2

offenses, the Federal obscenity offenses in Chapter 71

3

to the list of Federal predicates, but no corresponding

4

State crime for obscenity offenses.

5

The ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you say it works

7

now for the manufacturing and distribution offenses?

8

have your position on the possession ­­ well, you said

9

there's a disparity between a Federal conviction and a

10

State conviction.

11

manufacturing or distribution?

12

We

How about a conviction, either the

MR. ZAS:

Yes.

So ­­ so that offense is

13

covered by the different provision of Section 2251(e).

14

That's the penalty provision for the much more serious

15

crime of actually using minors or children to produce

16

this material.

17

The language in 2251(e) as amended in 2006

18

is ­­ it does seem to track, to qualify the predicates

19

to include State­law abuse offenses that involve adults

20

as well as children.

21

important textual difference between Section 2251(e) and

22

the statute we're talking about.

23

But that's because there's an

So if you go back to Section 2252(b)(2),

24

you'll see an important textual point here, which is the

25

word "or."

This may be easier to follow if you actually

look at the statute if you don't have it open in the

So why did Congress put them

both in?

5

MR. ZAS:

Well, because I think the first

point here is it must be for the same reason it used

aggravated sexual abuse at the beginning of the list,

8

which ­­ which I think both sides agree does no

independent work.

MR. ZAS:

Well, first, if you go back to the

2

time this ­­ this language we're talking about was first

added in 1996, that Congress not only knew how to ­­ how

21

MR. ZAS:

I didn't understand

Mr. Chief Justice, there are

to track when they wanted to track.

But that is the ­­ the idea that they were
picking up the definitions in the Federal provisions is

10

one explanation for this rather strange ­­ this list.

11

The other makes the list terribly redundant, and I

12

haven't heard your explanation as to why they would do

13

that.

sexual abuse?

sexual conduct?

have suggested.

3

Instead, they used a different term,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

that answers the redundancy question.

5

redundancy in both interpretations, but much more in

6

yours than in the government's.

7

MR. ZAS:

There's

Well, I ­­ I disagree with that.

all.

answer was responsive to Justice Alito's redundancy

13

question.

14
15

MR. ZAS:

It wasn't.

But that's the second

part of the answer.

16

The redundancy here was meant to go very

Mr. Zas, is it possible when

you read these three terms, as you say, Congress might

have meant to be just trying to pick up every

11

conceivable State statute it could think of.

12

possible also to think of these as the aggravated sexual

13

abuse is the worst offense; the sexual abuse is the

14

medium offense; and the abusive sexual conduct is

15

actually somewhat a more minor offense, in other words,

16

might include things that are not sexual abuse

17

themselves.

18

like that.

19

But it's

And if you understand the provisions in that

way as sort of going from the top to the bottom and

of them.

2

What do you think follows from that?

3

MR. ZAS:

Well, again, first, even with that

4

assumption, you have this prefatory language to the list

5

here, "relating to," which this Court has described ­­

6

has defined, has interpreted, to be very broad.

7

means "to stand in some relation to."

It only

When I think ­­ what I

think you would say is that if it's in descending order

like that, you don't have to make the third one, which

11

is already less than the second, which is less than the

12

first.

13

teeny, teeny third one by tagging on children only to

14

the third and not to the other two.

You don't have to make the third one a teeny,

15

It seems to me much more regular to assume,

16

as you do, that the limitation to children applies to

17

all three of these descending crimes.

terms, it's all overcome by the terms "relating to."

If that's so ­­ and

10

I don't know if this helps you or hurts you, but it

11

seems to me that there is a ready­made right there for a

12

drafter explanation of why he uses these words.

we first look to 41, and that's aggravated.

14

look to 42, and that's sexual abuse without aggravated.

15

And conduct is just the same as contact, but the drafter

16

is thinking maybe we should go a little bit bigger.

17

Now, the difficulty is in each of the sections I've

18

mentioned, there is a special related section for

children.

That's the focus.

Congress was trying to protect

that.

Now, that's a serious crime.

No one disputes

But it wasn't the focus of this legislation.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why would they be

13

focused on Federal sexual abuse involving adults but not

14

State sexual abuse involving adults?

15

MR. ZAS:

Because the 1996 Congress was

16

focused on a very specific problem that they identify.

17

And that's the link, the connection between child

18

pornography and other sex offenses against children.

19

So that was their focus.

And given that

20

focus and given that the other State law predicates in

21

this statute are also limited to ­­ to crimes against

22

children, they naturally limited these offenses as well

to children.

reasonably may have decided that it didn't want to sweep

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. O'CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

it please the Court:

2

This case involves two competing canons of

3

statutory interpretation, and there are four basic

4

reasons why we think the government's interpretation is

5

correct.

6

First, Petitioner's interpretation creates

7

an unexplained redundancy where the Court would have to

8

conclude that Congress created a list of three things,

9

two of which are the same.

10
11

Second, our interpretation is consistent
with the only possible reading of Section ­­

12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Let's do them

one by one.

14

On the first one, even under your

15

interpretation, two of the three are the same, aren't

16

they?

17

MS. O'CONNELL:

Under our interpretation,

18

what ­­ what we've said is that the first category and

19

the third category are logically subsets of the more

20

general category of sexual abuse.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MS. O'CONNELL:

23
24
25

Right.
But there's a couple of

explanations for why Congress may have done that.
The first is that, when they added these
State law predicates to the Section 2252(b)(1) for the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

first time in 1996, there already were Federal

2

predicates on the list that included aggravated sexual

3

abuse, sexual abuse, and sexual abuse of a minor or

4

ward.

5

have covered everything it wanted to cover in the State

6

law crimes by just saying "sexual abuse," it would have

7

opened itself up to arguments if it had just said all of

8

those Federal crimes and then any State law relating to

9

sexual abuse, that those other types of sexual abuse

10

So even though it may be true that Congress could

under State law were not covered.

11

Especially with respect to the third

12

category, sexual abuse or abusive sexual conduct

13

involving a minor or ward, Congress made clear when it

14

included that third category that it was picking up

15

State law offenses where a person is deemed incapable of

16

consenting to sexual contact or sexual conduct, because

17

of their status as either a minor or a ward.

18

So our interpretation can be explained.

19

There is redundancy, and we're not asking for just an ­­

20

a straight invocation of the canon against surplusage.

21

Both interpretations contain surplusage.

22

reason why it doesn't make sense to apply the

23

series­qualifier canon here, because it ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

But it's a

Why do you resist ­­ why ­­

why do you resist the argument that what Congress was

Official

doing was picking up basically the definitions of the

2

Federal offenses that are worded almost identically?

3

that's what they are doing, then it's understandable

4

what is meant by all three terms.

5

they were doing, it's a strange coincidence.

6

If

If that's not what

And not only is there redundancy, but

7

there's ambiguity about what is meant by sexual abuse as

8

opposed to abusive sexual conduct, and why they had to

9

put in aggravated sexual abuse in addition to sexual

10

abuse.

11

MS. O'CONNELL:

Justice Alito, we ­­ we

12

don't think that Congress was trying to pick up the

13

exact definitions of the three Federal statutes.

14

think that's most clear, as Petitioner pointed out, by

15

the fact that there are other provision in this chapter

16

where Congress used different language when it wanted to

17

do so.

The most clear example is the recidivist
provision for the sexual abuse offenses.

category, "sexual abusive conduct involving a minor or

Congress was picking up State offenses where a person is

deemed incapable of giving consent because they are a

But a ward ­­ a ward could

MS. O'CONNELL:

Correct.

And I think this is a ­­ a key point that
Petitioner has never really answered is that Petitioner

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

is trying to say that there is this clear pattern that

2

Congress had when it was creating the ­­ these lists,

3

and that the Federal crimes can involve both adults and

4

minors, but it was always limiting the State law crimes

5

to crimes against children.

6

And even under his interpretation, because "wards" are

7

included, there is at least some adult sexual­abuse

8

crimes against adults that are being swept up even if it

9

applies to all three categories.

10

And it just isn't the case.

And also in Section 2251(e), the ­­

11

the enhancement for child pornography production

12

offenses, the only way that you could read that

13

provision is to include sexual abuse offenses against

14

adults.

15

And so it's not the case that there is this

16

very clear pattern where Congress was only including

17

child victim counterparts to all of the Federal offenses

18

that it was putting on the list.

category.

10

Where did he get that idea?

What ­­ what

11

had the Department said that ­­ that suggested the

12

opposite?

13

MS. O'CONNELL:

There was the ­­ this letter

14

submitted in 1998 that the Petitioner cites where, when

15

the ­­ the author of the letter ­­ the ­­ the point of

the paragraph is to say, look, Congress, in the ­­ the

8

But if you just read the rest of the list of things that

9

Congress included and take a look at it, we think

It could go either way.

10

there's four things that jump out that make clear that

11

involving a minor or ward only is modifying the last

12

category.

13

that Petitioner's interpretation creates.

14

The first is the ­­ the redundancy problem

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, could I ask about

15

your ­­ your basic theory as to that, which, if I

16

understand it, says the reason why we shouldn't worry

17

about the redundancy you create is because Congress just

18

wanted to make absolutely clear that the sexual abuse

19

was also sexual abuse involving somebody who couldn't

20

consent.

21

That's basically your theory.
And there is a very easy way to do that, and

22

it would have completely made this ­­ I mean, made this

23

a hundred percent clear.

24

aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual abuse

25

involving a minor or ward.

Congress would just have said

And just by using the exact

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

same language, it would have been clear, but the

2

distinction was between sexual abuse and sexual abuse

3

involving a minor or ward.

4

But Congress doesn't do that, right?

5

Congress changes the language of the third noun.

6

that's what creates the puzzlement.

7

seems to me that your theory doesn't really cohere with

8

the fact that this third term ­­ although, nobody can

9

say exactly what it means that is different ­­ the third

10

And

And ­­ and so it

term is linguistically dissimilar from the second one.

11

MS. O'CONNELL:

It is, but ­­ but under a

12

generic interpretation of sexual abuse, any generic

13

definition that a court has come up with, I think one

that is a typical one is sexual conduct that uses or

misuses or injures a victim so as to cause harm or

16

damage.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MS. O'CONNELL:

No apology necessary.
No, it wasn't.
The second reason why we

16

think the Petitioner's interpretation doesn't make sense

17

is because in the penalty provision for production

18

offenses Section 2251(e), Petitioner agrees that the

19

only way you can read that penalty provision is to

20

include State sexual abuse offenses against adults,

21

because Congress worded it slightly differently.

22

included all the same crimes, but the way that provision

23

is ­­ reads, it says, "State laws relating to aggravated

24

sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact

6

This is at page 13A of the appendix to the gray

And so there's only one possible

7

interpretation of the list of State sexual­abuse

offenses in Section 2251(e), and there's two possible

9

interpretations of the ­­ the same three crimes in the

10

next provision.

11

between saying that those ­­ the State sexual abuse

12

offenses have different scopes in the two provisions.

13

And so the Court would have a choice

Third is that it ignores ­­ Petitioner's

14

interpretation ignores the clear parallel between the ­­

15

the three main categories of sexual abuse offenses in

Fourth, fourth.
The fourth is that

Petitioner's interpretation would frustrate the purpose

20

of the statute because under the categorical approach,

21

it would exclude as predicates any sexual abuse crimes

22

that were committed against children if the defendant
