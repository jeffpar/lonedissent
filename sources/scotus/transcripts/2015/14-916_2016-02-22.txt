ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. SAUNDERS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SAUNDERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

By its plain terms, the 2006 Veterans Act

12

requires the VA to consider veterans first under the

13

Rule of Two before awarding contracts to other

14

suppliers.

15

That mandate, which applies only to the VA

16

and reflects the agency's unique obligation to veterans,

17

contains no exception for the contracts formed when the

18

VA makes awards under the Federal Supply Schedule.

19

the government's attempt to create such an exception

20

fares no better than its prior attempts to resist the

21

mandate.

22

And

Its semantic distinction between contracts

23

and orders conflicts with its own concession that an FSS

24

order is a contract in the ordinary sense.

25

creates ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Before you get too deeply

2

into the merits of the case, could you just tell us what

3

relief you could get at this point that's consistent

4

with the Tucker Act?

5

MR. SAUNDERS:

We're seeking a declaratory

6

judgment that, with respect to these particular

7

procurements, the VA erred in failing to conduct market

8

research and ­­ and to apply the Rule of Two before

9

going straight to the FSS.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On the ground that this

11

is capable of repetition yet evasive of review, is that

12

your ­­ your answer to the mootness?

13

MR. SAUNDERS:

Absolutely.

It's ­­ it's

14

recurred ­­ the same situation's recurred numerous

15

times.

16

Kingdomware continues to be actively competing for these

17

contracts, and these contracts are of a short duration.

22

Even during the course of this litigation,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What was the amount of

this contract?
MR. SAUNDERS:

This contract was for a base

amount of $33,000.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it strange to get a

23

declaratory judgment that something unlawful occurred in

24

the past but that no other relief is available for this

25

past violation of the law?

Alderson Reporting Company

5
1

MR. SAUNDERS:

Well, no other relief is

2

available solely because of the passage of time it has

3

taken for this case to work its way up to this Court.

4

And that's why the doctrine of capable of repetition yet

5

evading a view ­­ review is ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:
is:

What ­­ what I'm getting at

What good would such a declaratory judgment do?
MR. SAUNDERS:

Well, once ­­ once the legal

rights, once the meaning of 8127(d) is established in

10

this case by that declaratory judgment, then going

11

forward, you would expect that the VA will comply with

12

this Court's interpretation of the law.

13

be a tremendous benefit to the veterans community going

14

forward from that declaration, from that elucidation of

15

the legal rights here.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so it would

So there was relief.

You just gave it away, essentially.
MR. SAUNDERS:

Well, the ­­ the Tucker Act

23

doesn't allow for the protest costs, and so the ­­ the

24

relevant costs that might have been allowed would be bid

25

preparation costs.

Alderson Reporting Company

6
1

But the very point of this case is there

2

wasn't an opportunity to bid.

3

which the opportunity was put out there and Kingdomware

4

was able to compete for it.

5

through the Rule of Two process required by 8127, went

6

straight to the Federal Supply Schedule, and the first

7

that Kingdomware ever learned of it was when the

8

announcement went up saying that the contract had been

9

awarded on the sole­source basis to someone else under

10
11

This isn't a situation in

It was ­­ it skipped

the Federal Supply Schedule.
So under the circumstances of this case,

12

where it's about the government going to a procedure it

13

shouldn't be going to first, there's no opportunity to

14

amass those bid protests.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your client is still an

22

23

24

limits the eligibility for the Rule of Two here.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that also ensures that

that Justice Sotomayor's question is asking you to

one, the Rule of Two only applies when you have both

9

fair and reasonable price and best value to the

10

United States.

11

it's not going to be met by going through the Rule of

12

Two, then I think you have leeway within the best­value

13

determination.

So if there's truly an urgent need and

Are ­­ these terms imply a lot of

discretion:

The idea that that's going to operate as a

significant restraint on the requirement that the VA

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How is it apparent that a

3

particular veteran's business can perform a particular

4

contract?

5

this veteran's small business is capable of performing

6

this contract in a reasonably effective way?

7

I mean, what in the database shows you, yes,

MR. SAUNDERS:

The ­­ because the database

8

has the North American Industry Classification System

9

codes, which are actually the same codes that correspond

10

to what's in the FSS.

11

And to the extent there is additional

12

information that's needed, it's very easy to contact the

13

veterans in those ­­ that database.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, could you

get back to your answer to my question?

16

MR. SAUNDERS:

Oh.

And ­­ and so there's ­­

17

for the heartland of ­­ of small­business contracting,

18

the ­­ are going to fall into the simplified acquisition

19

procedures under part 13 of the Federal Acquisition

20

Regulation.

21

for procurement of goods, it's now up to $7 million.

That's for services under $150,000.

And

22

And under that system, you have a greatly

23

streamlined process for the smallest contracts, micro

24

purchases.

25

decision for the sort of lower tier of contracts,

It's ­­ it's really just you make the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11

certainly for anything under $25,000, all the ­­ all the

2

government's doing is placing a purchase order under the

3

simplified acquisition procedures.

4

There is a standard form.

It's Form 1449.

5

It's a single sheet of paper.

6

order that they place.

7

looks almost identical to FSS Form 347 for how you place

8

the order.

9

And that's the purchase

And quite frankly, the form

So for the lower­level stuff, there is

10

already a procedure outside the FSS that's incredibly

11

streamlined.

12

dollar­valued contracts, the requirements of going

13

within the FSS begin to ramp up in terms of having to

14

seek price reductions.

Business Act, there were agencies that were doing

set­asides, and then it was made explicit that they

could do set­asides within the FSS.

framework in terms of Federal Prison Industries, the

mandates mandatory effect without going to the FSS.

bigger.

And quite frankly, when we get to those

16

bigger dollar figures, the idea that if ­­ if a small

business is going to qualify for a contract that's above

$150,000, that we can't go through the procedures that

19

Congress mandated here, the VA can't even consult its

20

own database and see whether there's an eligible

21

supplier before going straight to the FSS I don't think

holds water in that sense.

And at the end of the day here, we're

looking at a mandate that was plain on its face in terms

of Congress saying shall award contracts, contracts

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

MR. SAUNDERS:

It ­­ it could be, but we're

talking about a period in time when there have been

goals since 1999, discretionary authority since 2003.

And as of 2005, the government's progress towards its

3­percent goal was .6, six­tenths of 1 percent.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, it sounds like the

government did very badly in meeting its goals.

can understand why Congress would have done something to

say the government ­­ and specifically the VA ­­ has to

7

do a lot better toward meeting its goals.

And you

But the goals are still, you know, pretty
far down compared to what Justice Breyer was indicating

is the natural tendency of this system that you're

to set their goals based on the maximum practical

the VA had already set a higher goal.

2

seems like there might be some mismatch between the

mandate and the goals, you have to remember that at this

You're telling us the Federal circuit was
wrong.

13

MR. TRIPP:

I guess ­­ about the Federal

14

circuit's position, we think the Federal circuit's

15

rationale is right, so far as it goes, but that it's

16

incomplete.

17

answer for why Petitioner's sort of maximalist position

18

is wrong, which is that if ­­ if this mandate applies in

19

100 percent of procurements, then the secretary's

20

discretion to set goals is pretty much wiped out, and

21

it's hard to even talk about them as goals at all.

22

the fact that there needs to be discretion somewhere in

this scheme doesn't really answer where the discretion

24

needs to exist.

We're not saying that when you place an

What we're saying is that when Congress

JUSTICE ALITO:

Your answer to Justice

the real answer to ­­ is the real answer to this

14

question that the ­­ the VA regulations don't say

15

anything about goals?

16

MR. TRIPP:

And isn't

But it's not only that the VA

17

regulations don't say anything about goals.

18

the VA's regulations map up perfectly with the argument

19

that we're ­­ we're ­­ we're pressing here, which is

20

that this is a mandate that we apply in 100 percent of

21

procurements when we are awarding a wholly new contract.

22

We do it every single time under the regulations, but

23

those regulations never even come up.

a certain category of products or services.

6

we're placing an order under those preexisting

And so

How difficult is it for

you to take the database that you have with respect to

to deliver the quality care that we're trying to

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is this the case?

Do I

6

understand this?

7

Question one in my mind, is it the case that they lose

8

because the agency does not have to apply veterans only

9

where they way exceeded their goal?

10

Am I ­­ there are three parts to this.

The answer to that in the opinion would say,

11

we do not reach that question for there are no

12

regulations that suggest that the agency has tried to

13

take that approach.

14
15

Am I right so far?

MR. TRIPP:

That has tried to take the

approach of saying that we drop it if we're way over ­­

that.

24

yes, you do in respect to them.

25

you don't.

And there are two parts to

Or we might say, no,

But if we say yes, you do, at least we

38
1

don't, in your opinion, wreck the system.

2

Then we get to Step 3.

All right.

There is no veteran

3

on the FSS.

4

is that, look, everyone on the FSS is a person who has

5

entered into a contract, which contract says that when

6

called upon for further supply, they will give it.

7

right?

Now what do we do?

8

MR. TRIPP:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And there your argument

Am I

Yes.
So, therefore, it is that

10

contract, not the contract within the contract that

11

they're talking about.

12

we would have to take an architect who has 40,000 pages

13

of things he's going to do, and we change the sentence

14

on page 389 to read 300 rather than 400, and we say

15

that's a new contract, or something like that.

16

trying to make an argument for you.

17

within a contract, it is contract to which this refer.

Am I way off base or is that what you're trying to say?

into.

6

name do you get out of his argument?

7

If you're not saying that, then how in heaven's

MR. TRIPP:

We're saying that when we place

8

an order under a preexisting contract, that that is not

9

awarding a new ­­ awarding a contract within the meaning

10
11

of these procurement statutes.
There have been ­­ I ­­ I really do want to

12

emphasize the historical context that's built up over

13

decades about the understanding of this phrase,

14

"throughout Federal procurement law," right?

15

five prior statutes on exactly this same subject, and

16

every one of them has been interpreted by the FAR to be

17

categorically inapplicable when placing orders under

preexisting contracts.

There's

troubling about their position is that if you say, well,

we want to read a lot into this special provision,

nothing special about the language.

major ways that people ­­ that agencies purchase

services.

25

it's ­­ it's ­­ you know, it's not like Amazon.com, but

It's like one of the

And the ­­ the standard way of doing it,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

you can go on to a website, drill down, see all the

2

vendors who ­­ who are already prequalified to provide

3

that kind of service.

4

would do this is that you would request ­­ request

5

quotes from at least three of them, and then consider

6

them when they come in.

7

And the standard way that you

And when you request ­­ request the quote

8

from them, even if you request it from three or four of

9

them, every vendor on the schedule who is preapproved

will ­­ will see that it's open and can submit an offer,

11

and then ­­ and then the ­­ the agency would consider

12

all the offers that were given to it, and it picks the

13

one that offers the best value.

14

So that's how it would work if we were doing

something like hiring a temporary psychiatrist at a ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

procurements by way of the FSS.

21

heads that this is all about, you know, staples and

22

paperclips, but that, in fact, the FSS is being used to

23

do things that would previously have been done on the

open market.

25

MR. TRIPP:

That we have it in our

I ­­ I ­­ I ­­ well, first, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46

want to emphasize that the VA's primary use of this,

2

again ­­ this is not ­­ I'm not talking about staples

and paperclips.

4

the medical­related stuff, the, you know, wheelchairs,

5

6

We're talking about, you know, the ­­

But yes, a lot of the FSS ­­ even for more

7

complex procurement, the FSS is still substantially

8

easier.

9

aggregating the government's buying power.

And the FSS, you tend to already be sort of
And so the

10

pricing is ­­ the idea of the ­­ of the FSS is that it's

11

both easier to do and that the price will ordinarily be

12

lower.

13

And so ­­ I mean, the ­­ the agency wouldn't

14

be going into the FSS if the agency didn't think that

15

that was the ­­ the best approach.

16

whenever the procurement is over half a million dollars,

17

I believe, the FAR requires the contracting officer to

18

make an affirmative, express determination on exactly

19

that point:

20

to provide the best value for us overall.

21

And in fact,

That ­­ that going through the FSS is going

And I ­­ and just to respond to Petitioner's

effort to put a lot of weight onto the best­value

23

language in the ­­ in the Rule of Two, I'm a little

confused by that because ­­ exactly because when ­­

25

whenever the agency is placing an order under the FSS,

Alderson Reporting Company

under the FAR, that ­­ that the ­­ the contracting

officer is making a determination that that order is the

best value.

that ­­ that may just collapse on its own weight.

don't ­­ I don't quite understand where that argument

goes.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I

Mr. Tripp, can ­­ can I ask,

8

what effect would this statute really have on your view?

9

As I understand it, the government does have to use the

10

Rule of Two on all open­market purchases; is that right?

11
12

MR. TRIPP:

regulations implemented it, yes.

13
14

Under the statute, our

Above, like, a very low

Is it 3,500, something like that?

15

MR. TRIPP:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

Right, right.
So ­­ so if you're right,

17

what did this statute actually accomplish?

18

words, you already have to use the Rule of Two for

19

open­market purchases, or almost all of them.

20

MR. TRIPP:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. TRIPP:

Oh, right.

with section 8128, which they mention in the brief,

Restricting competition is a very

So again, I think, I just want to emphasize

at ­­ at closing that our ­­ our major concern is with

prevent us from ­­ from placing orders at all, even when

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. SAUNDERS:

11

This case should begin and end for this

Thank you.

12

Court with the concession that in the ordinary sense of

13

the term, an order under the FSS is a contract.

14

Congress chose sweeping language here in acting its

15

mandate, and that language encompasses FSS orders.

16

to the extent there are, you know, changes that would

17

need to be made or other policy considerations, those

18

can be made by Congress in the future.

19

consideration it made is ­­ is embodied in the statutory

20

language it chose.

21

And

But the policy

Now, the idea that we're going to come back

22

and limit this based on a specialized meaning of the

23

word "contract," we should remember that that argument

24

is not one that appeared in this case until the

25

government's merits brief in this Court.

If it's a settled background interpretation

2

that ­­ that Congress was incorporating that limitation

3

into the Act, you think it would have occurred to them

4

in the last decade, the carve­outs for the Small

5

Business Act exceptions were never justified based on

6

providing a narrower meaning of the word "contract," and

7

on their face were expressly limited to the Small

8

Business Act, the provision that applied to part 19 of

9

the FAR implementing the Small Business Act.

10

Well, to the extent there's an exception for

11

the Small Business Act, well, Congress came in here is

12

it rejected the Small Business Act approach.

13

than continuing to tinker within the framework of the

14

Small Business Act where this exception applied, it said

15

we're taking this mandate out of the Small Business Act,

16

we're going to narrow it, it's not going to be a

17

government­wide mandate, but we're going to apply it

18

specifically to the VA in light of its unique

19

obligations and set the VA up as the driver of

20

procurement in this area; have it set the example for

21

the rest of the government.

22

Rather

Congress was making ­­ balancing these

23

policy considerations.

24

into something that was administratively unworkable.

25

And if you ­­ the dire consequences that we're hearing

It wasn't going to be blundering

Alderson Reporting Company

today really stood any chance of coming to pass, I don't

2

think that you would have the American Legion, the Iraq

3

and Afghanistan veterans, 41 members of Congress, who

4

care deeply about veterans issues, supporting

5

Kingdomware's position in this case.

6

The reality is if the government's only

7

doing 20 percent of its procurements from FSS, you're

8

already talking about a broad mandate.

9

respect to those existing ones, you have to have a

10

business that is eligible, it has to appear in the

11

database, and it has to be able to offer a fair and

12

reasonable price and best value.

And then with

13

And as the ­­ the Chief Justice discussed

14

for some of these big order commodity contracts, that

15

it's going to be a difficult fight for the ­­ for the

16

drugs that are being offered here, there's a statutory

17

provision that says that the government acquires its

18

drugs at 76 percent of the average price that

19

wholesalers pay to the manufacturers.

20

average price that anyone else in the world can get from

21

the manufacturer and do a big discount on top of that.

22

Those are tough terms to beat.

23

So take the

And so I think that there's going to be ­­

24

you know, the reality here is not the dire consequences

25

that you're seeing, and the policy judgment is for

Congress.

2

enforced as written is going to hurt veterans in any

3

way, then you can expect Congress will act swiftly to

4

correct that problem.

5

And believe me, if anything in this mandate

But none of this supports the sweeping

6

carve­out that the government is saying that it doesn't

7

even have to look at its own database.

8

to consider a single veteran­owned small business, no

9

matter how competitive it would be, because it can go

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What response do you have

12

to judge ­­ Justice Ginsburg's question that really

13

you're making us a court of first impression here?

14

Shouldn't we send this back?

15

MR. SAUNDERS:

I don't think we should

16

because the meaning of "contract," this is a straight­up

17

question of law.

18

who are waiting for this law to be enforced as written

19

have already waited a decade.

20

back and have additional delay on a pure question of law

21

based on a new argument that the government's making for

22

the first time here sets a very bad precedent.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
