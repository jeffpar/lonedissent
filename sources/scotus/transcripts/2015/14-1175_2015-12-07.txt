ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The States entered the Union saddled with

12

substantial war debts.

13

Constitution were quick to point out any possibility

14

that the States could be haled into court by individual

15

citizens without their consent in order to secure

16

potentially bankrupting judgments.

17

As a result, critics of the

When this Court opened up the possibility of

18

just such a judgment by allowing Chisholm, a

19

South Carolina citizen, to sue the sovereign State of

20

Georgia in this Court, the nation quickly and

21

emphatically reacted with the Eleventh Amendment that

22

eliminated the possibility of such a suit even in this

23

most neutral of Federal forums.

24
25

Regardless of all that, Respondent's
position is that, if Chisolm has turned around and sued

Alderson Reporting Company

4
1

Georgia in South Carolina State court, and

2

South Carolina in its unreviewable discretion decided to

3

exercise jurisdiction over the sovereign State of

4

Georgia ­­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

MR. CLEMENT:

7

­­ there is nothing in Federal

law ­­

8
9

There is one ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There's one ­­ there's one

significant difference there, Mr. Clement, which is that

10

States are on a par with each other.

11

of mutuality.

12

that you don't like, you can turn it around and do it to

13

them.

14

the State will do that thing to you in the first place

15

because they know that.

16

So there's a kind

So if one State does something to you

And that mutuality also makes it less likely that

So ­­ so I think what Mr. Farr says is the

17

fact that there was this outrage with respect to a

18

Federal court might not have registered in quite the

19

same way when States were aware that they were on a par

20

with each other and that they had many weapons that they

21

could use against each other.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, here's

23

why I disagree.

24

independent nations would use vis­à­vis each other to

25

ensure that sovereign immunity as a comity did not

And because most of the weapons that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

become sovereign immunity in name only are precisely the

2

tools that the States surrendered to the national

3

government in the plan of the convention.

4

So if South Carolina had ­­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, for sure, Mr. ­­

6

Mr. Clement, you know, you couldn't go to war with the

7

neighboring State anymore, and that's a difference.

8

you could say, if you're going to treat me like that,

9

I'm going to treat you like that.

10

But

And ­­ and you have other ways of dealing

11

with ­­ with a State that you wouldn't have with the

12

Federal government.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, two

14

points.

15

ability to impose trade sanctions; it's the ability to

16

withdraw your ambassadors.

17

from the States.

18

First, it's not just the act of war.

It's the

All of that is taken away

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there anything in

19

our ­­ in ­­ in our jurisprudence or our constitutional

20

tradition that say States can protect each other by

21

retaliating against each other?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, that's the second point

23

I was going to make, Justice Kennedy, which is it's an

24

odd thing to think that the framers, who had just

25

experienced the Articles of Confederation where they had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

unsatisfied judgments and the potential that, if the

2

State of New York went after the State of Georgia

3

because Georgia hadn't complied with the requisition for

4

funds, that there would be civil war.

5

way they would want sovereign immunity, which no one

6

doubted exists, enforced was that kind of race to the

7

bottom.

8
9
10

The idea that the

As opposed to ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I ­­ I mean, I ­­ I

thought that ­­ I thought that it's illegal for a State
to ban Washington apples.

11

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, there is that.

12

something that's implicit in the Constitution.

13

think ­­

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's
And I

Mr. Clement, to take you

15

down to the practical level, and we're not getting

16

involved with war, take Nevada v. Hall.

17

Kagan's point is, if California says that a Nevada truck

18

coming on its California roads, injuring a California

19

resident, so then Nevada is liable to the courts and the

20

law of California, Nevada can say fine.

21

truck comes into our State and injures Nevada people, we

22

will do the same thing.

23
24
25

But Justice

If a California

That's what I think Justice Kagan had in
mind.
MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

Alderson Reporting Company

And I think

Official

7
1

that's the exact opposite of what the framers were

2

trying to do.

3

where there would be signs on State borders that say, if

4

you come in here, you thereby waive any sovereign

5

immunity and we will hale you into court and allow our

6

citizens to do it.

7

where the States came in with substantial war debts and

8

their sovereign immunity.

9

They weren't trying to adopt a union

Instead, they were adopting a union

And there is no way they would have

10

sacrificed their sovereign immunity, which was the key

11

protection for those war debts not being used against

12

them to bankrupt them.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

The system

14

that you're advocating ­­ just so I get it right ­­

15

you're saying constitutionally any ­­ every State is

16

immune from any acts that they commit ­­ this is the

17

point that Justice Ginsburg is making ­­ from any acts

18

they commit against a noncitizen even if they've waived

19

sovereign immunity within their own State.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, their ­­
All ­­ all ­­ all I have

22

to do is what?

23

who can ever be held ­­ who could ever sue a State for

24

whatever bad acts they've had.

25

There's no noncitizen of ­­ of a State

MR. CLEMENT:

Two points, Justice Sotomayor.

Alderson Reporting Company

8
1

First of all, let's take a Nevada resident, and let's

2

say California comes in.

3

certainly sue the State of California in California

4

court if there's a waiver of sovereign immunity.

5

the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV would

6

protect the Nevada citizen from California saying, well,

7

we're going to waive our sovereign immunity as to

8

California citizens but not Nevada residents.

9

The Nevada resident can

And

So that's one protection that they have.

10

The other point is what we're really talking

11

about is, as to the starting point, is the default rule.

12

Do you start with sovereign immunity?

13

It's always possible ­­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. CLEMENT:

16

What ­­ what's the ­­

­­ for States to agree to

waive their sovereign immunity.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. CLEMENT:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why would they do that?

Well, for ­­
I ­­ I ­­ I could

20

understand them getting together, which they haven't

21

done, to agree upon limits to each other's or waivers of

22

sovereign immunity.

23

together to do that?

But what would induce them to come

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I suppose consideration ­­
If they ­­ if they don't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

think that they're forced to?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, considerations of

3

convenience.

4

that they have sufficient comity and respect for each

5

other that it's perfectly fine for California to be sued

6

in Nevada court.

7

I mean, Nevada and California could decide

But conversely, they could come and make a

8

contrary decision because of their sovereign immunity

9

and say, no, if you want to sue us, come into our

10

courts.

11
12

And I think a case like ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And we have here 34

states tell us that they didn't like this rule.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

How come they haven't gotten together and

45.

16

done an agreement among all of them?

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Because it would be very

18

burdensome to do that.

19

respect, they think there already was an agreement among

20

the States through their people that solved this

21

problem.

22

sovereign immunity they would have.

And I think, with all due

And that's the Constitution.

23

If I could ­­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

It preserved the

There's no question that

they gave ­­ this is why the Eleventh Amendment ­­ they

Alderson Reporting Company

10
1

gave up a lot of things to the Federal government.

2

I can understand why they thought they needed the

3

Eleventh Amendment.

4

And

But what makes you think that they gave up

5

their sovereignty with each other with respect to these

6

kinds of issues?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Two things ­­
It's not in the

MR. CLEMENT:

Two things principally, Your

12

anything up.

13

they gave up is the right of one sovereign court system

14

to hale another sovereign into that court system.

15

that is a right that didn't exist at the founding.

First is, I don't think they actually gave

16

What my friend on the other side suggests

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

And that's what Hall said

17

didn't exist.

18

other, don't agree to respect the other's sovereign

immunity.

20

you are the king, where you are sovereign, a State's

immunity.

22

the ­­ in the picture, equally sovereign, then both of

23

them are sovereign, and neither has to respect the

24

sovereign immunity of the other, that it's just ­­ well,

25

when the ­­ when the nation was new, you will admit that

Hall said the States, vis­à­vis each

Hall distinguished sovereign immunity where

And then said, but when another State is in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

there was no full faith and credit obligation.

2

State was going to respect the sovereignty of the other,

3

it would be a matter of comity, right?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

You say "comity."

If one

I would

5

say, as a starting point, law of nations.

6

absolutely, it is true that whenever you're talking

7

about sovereign immunity in any court other than the

8

sovereign's own, you are talking about sovereign

9

immunity as of comity.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. CLEMENT:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

from comity to an obligation?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Okay.

But

So ­­

So ­­
So when did it change

Upon the framing of the

15

Constitution, just as it did with respect to every other

16

sovereign immunity principle.

17

emerges from this Court's cases is that if the ­­ the

18

States had preexisting sovereign immunity from a suit

19

and they did not sacrifice it in the plan of convention,

20

then they continue to enjoy it as a matter of

21

constitutional right.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The principle that

I would have thought you

23

would answer that the obligation was an obligation of

24

international law, that comity was an obligation of

25

international law insofar as it extended to sovereign

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

immunity of each State not being haled into the courts

2

of another State.

3

That was international law.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yeah.

The very concept

4

of comity is a matter of grace, that's international

5

law.

6

Guyot.

7

That's what this Court said in Hilton against
Comity is not a kind of a full faith and credit.
MR. CLEMENT:

But two points are important,

8

Justice Ginsburg.

9

nations as the framing between independent nations was a

First of all, although the law of

10

matter of comity, that didn't mean that there weren't

11

certain principles that were so well established that

12

any nation that didn't respect them would be committing

13

an act of war.

14

that you could not have an in personam suit against a

15

foreign sovereign.

16
17

And first on that list would be the idea

It was unheard of.

And my friend doesn't disagree with that.
think his response to the possibility ­­

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, haven't we now

19

recognized that there is no automatic immunity for a

20

sovereign nation, another nation?

21

Sovereign Immunities Act said, yeah, sometimes,

22

sometimes we respect the sovereignty of that foreign

23

nation, but sometimes we don't, like in commercial

24

deals.

25

I

MR. CLEMENT:

That ­­ the Foreign

Right, Justice Ginsburg, and I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

don't think that you want to resolve this case on the

2

law of nations' immunity principles, either in 1789 or

3

today.

4

because despite the relative laxity of waivers of

5

sovereign immunity in the current age, you still don't

6

have an in personam suit for something that's of course

7

sovereign function, like tax collection.

8

day, we couldn't sue France over the exact same

9

situation today.

10

But if you were to do that, we would still win,

Even to this

But I don't think the way that this Court's

11

cases apply the law of nations is the right way of

12

thinking about this.

13

about it is that sovereign immunity at the framing

14

becomes a constitutional principle.

15

Rather, the right way to think

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I think ­­

There is ­­ there is a

16

certain irony, isn't there, that California is the State

17

that gave us a Nevada against California, right?

18

California then was saying, oh, yes, we can sue the

19

sovereign in Nevada in our courts if they come into our

20

State and hurt our people.

21
22
23

And

It was California.

So is California now saying they were wrong
in the argument that they made?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I ­­ I think the FTB is

24

asking you ­­ which is an arm of California ­­ is asking

25

you to overrule Hall.

So I think it is fair to say that

Alderson Reporting Company

14

there is some buyer's remorse on the principle of Nevada

2

against Hall by the sovereign State of California.

3

But we're not estopped from making ­­

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, California has

5

6

MR. CLEMENT:

7

They didn't, but I think

that's because they felt that an arm of State was ­­

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

MR. CLEMENT:

10

Well, what's that ­­

­­ already here, so I think,

you know, that ­­ that that explains that.

11

But I want to make one point very clear,

12

which is this Court has a whole host of State sovereign

13

immunity cases dealing with the Federal courts.

14

one of those cases with the ­­ every one of the Federal

15

court cases and indeed every State sovereign immunity

16

case, with the exception of ­­ of ­­ of Alden against

17

Maine is a case that's applying sovereign immunity as of

18

comity.

19

foreign court system.

20

sovereign immunity as of right in any distinct court

21

system of a superior sovereign or of an independent

22

nation.

23

Every

Because the new Federal court system is a
The sovereigns did not have

So when this Court says, well, the States

24

had sovereign immunity and they didn't sacrifice it in

25

the Constitution, they're not talking in those cases

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

about sovereign immunity as of right; they're talking

2

about sovereign immunity as of comity.

3

So, too, in the tribal immunity cases.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

MR. CLEMENT:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what do you ­­

Everybody on this Court ­­
Mr. Clement, what do you

7

do with ­­ I mean, one time we had ­­ had this issue,

8

and the argument that you're making was ­­ was made

9

in ­­ in Alden, and the Court spent over two pages

10

distinguishing Nevada v. Hall on that very point, that

11

there ­­ when there are two sovereigns involved, then

12

it's different.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Oh, absolutely, and that's

14

because Alden is the only case that involves sovereign

15

immunity in the State sovereign immunity context.

16

are also Federal sovereign immunity cases, but in the

17

State sovereign immunity context, Alden is the only one

18

that's dealing with sovereign immunity in the

19

sovereign's own court system.

20

with sovereign immunity in a different court system,

21

either the Federal court system or the tribal court

22

system.

23

There

Every other one deals

That's ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in ­­ in ­­ in Hall

24

it does say, we determine the Constitution did not

25

reflect an agreement between States to respect the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

sovereign immunity of one another.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think that's

3

because ­­ I assume that comes from the part of Alden

4

where Alden is dealing with Hall as a given, and it's

5

saying that the result in Alden does not require the

6

overruling of Hall.

7

That's true, they are different issues.

8
9

I would take that.

That's fine.

I do think they create one anomaly after
another.

I mean, Chisholm can't sue Georgia in a

10

perfectly neutral Federal court; Chisholm can't sue

11

Georgia in Georgia court; but Chisholm can sue Georgia

12

in the least neutral court available, the State of South

13

Carolina.

14

That doesn't make any sense.
There is also the anomaly that apparently,

15

Alden's mistake was suing Maine in Maine court.

16

Alden would have sued Maine in New Hampshire court,

17

probably for Federal law or maybe for State law, then

18

that suit could have gone forward.

19

If

It is also anomalous that the tribes

20

apparently have greater immunity than the States, even

21

though they're inferior sovereigns, because you apply

22

these same principles to recognize tribal sovereign

23

immunity.

24

cases, even they recognize, well, States are different

25

because they are a superior sovereign.

And the dissenters in Footnote 1 of those

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, they are not totally

2

bizarre.

3

State maintained the sovereign power to define the

4

jurisdiction of its own courts, which is also an

5

important sovereign power.

6

power, then you have to say, well, what is it in the

7

Federal Constitution that limits or takes away that

8

sovereign power?

9

It flows from the principle in Nevada that the

So if you look at that

So that's, I think, where I'm left after

10

Nevada.

11

they require us, for the most part, to overrule several

12

cases.

13

And now you have a whole set of arguments, but

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't think so,

14

Justice Breyer.

15

may not be particularly responsive to you, which is to

16

say that I think all of this Court's post­Hall

17

decisions, some of which you have enjoined, actually

18

suggest that the burden's not on me to show where in the

19

Constitution it was taken away, but that the burden is

20

on my friend to show where the Constitution specifically

21

took away the States' sovereign immunity, where they

22

surrendered it.

23

Let me make two points, one of which

But I still think, Justice Breyer, I'm

24

not ­­ I'm not trying to not get your vote, because I

25

think even if the burden is on me to show where the

Alderson Reporting Company

2

implicit, but it is implicit in three places:

3

4

took the diplomatic and war tools away from the States.

I think it's
Article

Well, I'd like to get your

6

response to the second part of this.

7

mean, I ­­ I do ­­ that's ­­ I'm finding that rather

8

hard, and it seems to me intuitively at some level

9

correct that a State like Nevada should not be able to

give less sovereign immunity to California than it gives

and credit, the competing principle that, if you have a

policy of your own State that cuts the other way and

19

it's reasonable and so forth, you don't give full faith

20

and credit.

And that's what's bothering me,
I have ­­ all I have so far is

Full faith and credit, two statutes, sometimes

principle, the same kind of principles in the Congress

out of sovereign immunity, which is at $50,000, I think,

follow California's law.

theory about why you can't ­­ you ­­ you see where I'm

9

going?

I've been thinking about it.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. CLEMENT:

And I don't

I think, Justice Breyer ­­
I'd love your view on that.

­­ and I'm going to give you

13

my best answer on that, which is ultimately loop back to

14

Hall.

15

So my best answer on that is the way to

16

think about this is Nevada has said, we're going to

17

apply Nevada law, not California law, and Hyatt I says

18

that they can do that.

19

to apply Nevada's law of sovereign immunity, they get to

20

the point where there's a 50,000 damage cap and they

21

say ­­ unbelievably in my view ­­ but they say, oh,

22

well, this statute only applies to Nevada's government

23

agencies.

24

you don't get the benefit of it.

25

But then they ­­ when they start

And you're not a Nevada government agency, so

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

MR. CLEMENT:

Now, if ­­ rather, if Nevada

2

did the exact same thing to a citizen of California in a

3

damage cap that applied not to sovereigns but to

4

citizens, I read my friend on page 52 of his brief to

5

say that that would violate the Privileges and

6

Immunities Clause of Article IV, that you couldn't just

7

say, well, no, that's a benefit only for Nevada

8

residents.

9
10
11

So his position ultimately is the sovereign
is worse off than the citizen, which can't be right.
Now, I think there are two ways to respond

12

to that complete anomaly.

13

maybe it's not right there in the text of it, that the

14

principles of Article IV's Full Faith and Credit Clause

15

provide the same principle, the same protection that the

16

Privileges and Immunities Clause applies to a citizen.

17

One is to say that, although

But I think ultimately the better way to

18

look at it is to say the reason the framers put the

19

Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the

20

unamended Constitution is they realized States could be

21

sued in other States' courts.

22

vulnerability they needed to address.

23

So there was a

They simultaneously implicitly recognized

24

that there was no way on earth that a sovereign could be

25

sued in another State's court because of age­old

sovereign immunity principles.

2

needed to give express protection to the sovereign the

3

way they did to the citizen.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So they didn't feel they

Mr. Clement, I ­­ I assume,

5

but maybe I'm wrong, that it ­­ it follows from your

6

argument that a ­­ a State could not adopt the

7

equivalent of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and

8

make ­­ make other States suable in ­­ in their State

9

courts for commercial activities.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Not ­­ not of its own force.

11

I mean, I think one way of thinking about this is I

12

don't think ­­

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know what you mean:

Not of its own force.

15

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm talking

about a State just enacting ­­

­­ a State legislature

22

enacting a statute that is the equivalent of the Foreign

23

Sovereign Immunities Act.

24

MR. CLEMENT:

Any foreign State that is

I think that's a power

they yielded to the Federal government in the plan ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But ­­ but that does

raise ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So that ­­ that creates

something of an ­­ of an anomaly which is that foreign

10

States can be sued, but ­­ but your sister State can't.

11

That's a little strange, isn't it?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

No.

No, I don't think it is

13

strange, Your Honor.

14

from a different angle ­­ and maybe you get to a

15

different place.

16

plain as day that, the day after the plan of the

17

Convention passes, the State of South Carolina can't

18

entertain a suit against His Majesty, the King of

19

England, in their ­­ in ­­ in South Carolina court

20

because of law of nation principles first or the fact

21

that they yielded the opportunity to do that to the

22

Federal government.

23

But, I mean, I think coming at it

I don't know.

But I think it would be

I think in the same way, the States yielded

24

their ability to make determinations, make treaties with

25

foreign governments over foreign sovereign immunity.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

They yielded that to the Federal government.

2

But vis­à­vis each other, what they

3

preserved as a constitutional matter is an immunity from

4

being haled into each other's courts.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Clement,

6

Justice Scalia's question does suggest that there are

7

sovereign interests on both sides of this.

8

There's ­­ one is I want to have sovereign immunity.

9

want to avail myself of sovereign immunity.

Right?
I

And the

10

other is I want to subject another State to my court

11

system when I feel like it, and I want the choice of

12

doing that or reaching an agreement with another State

13

that we should all treat each other nicely.

14

So on your view, the States are giving up

15

some significant sovereignty interest.

16

one, but they're also giving up one.

17

that you have to answer is why ­­ why is it so obvious

18

that the States would have made that choice rather than

19

the other choice?

20

for us just fine to have the choice and to deal with our

21

States on a going­forward basis on principles of

22

mutuality.

23

They're keeping

And the question

Which is, hey, it's been working out

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Kagan, I think there's

24

two reasons that it is glaringly obvious that the States

25

would have made exactly the choice I'm suggesting.

One

is they weren't giving up anything they actually thought

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14
15

MR. FARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Since much of the discussion this morning

16

has turned on the possible overruling of Nevada v. Hall,

17

I'd like to start, if I might, by setting out what I

18

think are the two main reasons why Nevada v. Hall

19

shouldn't be overruled.

20

First of all, the Court in Nevada v. Hall,

21

unlike the Board in its argument, took account of the

22

fact that, after the formation of the Union, the States

23

retained a great deal of their essential sovereign

24

attributes, and that it was fundamentally inconsistent

25

with those sovereign attributes for another State to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

declare itself immune as of right from its jurisdiction.

2

The second reason is that the Board has

3

failed to show that the ordinary political processes ­­

4

in particular an agreement among the 46 States, which

5

are now represented before the Court, saying they all

6

agree there should be absolute immunity in each other's

7

courts ­­ why they can't reach that agreement and ­­ and

8

have that effectively be the law going forward without

9

the intervention of this Court and without the need for

10

this Court ­­

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

intervention of Congress, I assume, right?

13

MR. FARR:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

I'm sorry, Justice Scalia?
They would need the

intervention of Congress.

16
17

They would need the

I thought compacts between

MR. FARR:

That

8

going to throw the States back on themselves; all the

9

States negotiate with each other?

10

That's not part of

our constitutional tradition at all.

11

MR. FARR:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I ­­ I

12

guess I do disagree with that.

13

there is something that's been set up by the Council of

14

State Governments called the National Center for

15

Interstate Compacts, and its job is to help the State

16

facilitate agreements among themselves on matters of

17

common interest.

18

agreements.

19

I mean, there is ­­

And there are hundreds of these

So the idea that ­­ that the States should

20

not be able to get together and formulate policies that

21

are mutually beneficial to them, and reach them by

22

agreement rather than approaching the Federal courts and

23

saying overrule one of your prior cases or invent a

24

novel principle of Federal law to ­­ to limit the

25

damages, seems to me exactly what the States, as

sovereigns, ought to be doing.

11

sovereign interest here in protecting and

12

13
14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I think Mr. Clement

says that there are two answers to that.

15

One is that they actually never exercised

16

that sovereign interest, so it didn't mean very much to

17

them.

18

And the other is that in exercising that

19

sovereign interest, they would be violating norms of

20

international law, so that they wouldn't have really

21

thought that that was a significant and exercisable

22

interest.

23
24
25

But those are his two arguments against
that.
MR. FARR:

Right.

And I don't think,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

frankly, either one really carries much weight.

2

the ­­ the first one is a ­­ is a chicken­or­egg

3

problem, in a sense.

4

the States had not exercised their power, if we're

5

talking about the late 1700s.

6

the power for ten years, but they ­­ they hadn't

7

exercised the power to subject other States to their

8

jurisdiction.

9

I mean

It is true that they were not ­­

They ­­ they'd only had

Nathan v. Virginia is an example where, with

10

the intervention of the Pennsylvania executive

11

officials, the Pennsylvania courts said, no, we're not

12

going to exercise jurisdiction over Virginia.

13

other side of that, of course, is that they always had

14

immunity as a ­­ as a matter of comity from the other

15

States.

16

But the

So if one is looking at the question of how

17

do we think about this, looking back in time, several

18

hundred years, what decision would the States have made?

19

The answer is we really don't know.

20

with that.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

They weren't faced

So if the ­­ if the States

22

thought that they had retained this power, why have you

23

not cited any cases in which this was exercised before

24

Nevada v. Hall?

25

MR. FARR:

Because there basically are no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

cases where the power was exercised.

2

the courts ­­ I mean, the courts of the various States

3

­­ were treating the other States as immune.

4

weren't very many suits filed, but immune as a matter of

5

comity.

6

relationships between these sovereigns are all about.

7

Up to that point,

There

But that, of course, is exactly what the

If one goes back and starts with a

8

foundational decision, which is Schooner Exchange,

9

Schooner Exchange is a very important decision about

10

sovereign immunity, but it's also, and principally, a

11

decision about sovereignty.

12

And what Schooner Exchange says is that each

13

sovereign within its own territory has exclusive and

14

absolute authority.

15

is going to come into that territory and act contrary to

16

the laws of the sovereign, it can only do that with the

17

consent of the home sovereign.

18

which all of this is based.

19

And therefore, if another sovereign

That's the principle on

So this ­­ although there are obviously two

20

sovereigns involved, and a sovereign interest in each

21

case, an interest in immunity on the part of the

22

visiting sovereign, an interest in having its exclusive

23

authority over its territory over the home sovereign,

24

Schooner Exchange actually tells you the answer if they

25

come in conflict, because the requirement of consent of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

the home sovereign is what is ultimately predominant.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Farr, I'm concerned

Nonetheless, in Chisholm, we ­­ we ­­ we

in the Eleventh Amendment.

18

That rested upon ­­ this is what Justice

19

Hughes said it rested upon, "Manifestly, we cannot rest,

20

we cannot assume that the letter of the Eleventh

21

Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against

provisions are postulates which limit and control.

controversies as contemplated shall be found to be of a

justiciable character.

States of the union, still possessing attributes of

sovereignty, shall be immune from suits without their

5

consent, save where there has been a surrender of this

6

7

There is also the postulate that

In other words, Hans says there's an

8

assumption behind the Eleventh Amendment that the States

cannot be sued without their consent.

suit in ­­ in Federal courts, and not to suits in the

12

State ­­ in ­­ in the courts of other States?

13

MR. FARR:

I think the answer to that,

14

Justice Scalia, is because the situations are very

15

different.

16

the Board, I think, presents, generally ­­ and I want to

17

get very specifically to the question, but I want ­­ I

18

want to just preface with this one observation, if I

19

may.

20

I think, in fact ­­ I mean, the notion that

The Board's suggestion, I think, is what the

21

Court really just needs to do now is put the third leg

22

on the immunity triangle.

23

States have immunity in their own courts, which is the

24

English tradition, and that States have immunity in

25

Federal courts.

It's already made clear that

That's the Eleventh Amendment.

Alderson Reporting Company

So all,

really, the Court should be doing now is to draw the

2

last part of that and say they have immunity in the

courts of other States.

situations.

5

But those are all different

They ­­ the States have immunity in their

own courts, just as nations do, because they are the

8

sovereigns when you're talking about immunity in your

10

There aren't two

So that's one separate thing.
Now, to get specifically to the question

11

you're raising, Justice Scalia:

12

courts, which is broader than the language of the

Eleventh Amendment.

14

are courts of a different sovereign, in a sense, than

the State courts.

16

Immunity in the Federal

But at the time that the Constitution was

17

being drafted and the question of ratification came up,

18

this was an issue that was specifically discussed.

19

therefore, when the States were concerned about

20

ratifying the Constitution because of their war debts,

21

they raised questions, and the Framers, like Madison and

22

Hamilton, so on and so forth, gave them assurances.

23

that was the deal.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. FARR:

That's ­­ that's the part I want

to get to because, if one applies the Full Faith and

in Hyatt I and ­­ and rejected California's argument

21

that its immunity law, giving absolute immunity, has to

23

So the Court has already crossed that bridge, at least

to some extent.

In other words, when ­­ when a State says,

The original argument ­­ the fact

19

In its brief, originally, the Board said

22

applied totally, because that was already rejected in

California's law of immunity doesn't apply to

So what ­­ what the Board is groping for is

9

some sort of loose principle that the Court could apply

10

to override a State's judgment about how to apply its

of promoting State sovereignty.

the question is where would that come from.

But leaving that aside,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. ­­
So I just wanted to finish

4

with some anomalies here because we've talked about a

5

couple of them.

Privileges and Immunities Clause prevent Nevada from

7

doing this to a citizen.

We've talked about this idea that the

10

going to be able to do.

12

California and sue consistent with California's waiver

13

of sovereign immunity.

14

brief, there are some remedies there.

One thing they can do is go to

As we point out in the reply

15

But the other thing they can do, as Justice

16

Kennedy pointed out for the Court in Alden, is there is

17

still the possibility of an individual capacity suit

18

against one of the California officers.

19

Now, here's something anomalous:

If you

20

sued the California officer, who's presumably a

21

California resident, they would have the protection of

22

removal to Federal court, so they'd at least be given a

23

neutral Federal forum.

24

here, they were confronted with Mr. Hyatt's quite

25

correct objection that the Eleventh Amendment prevented

When my client tried to remove

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57

removal to Federal court.

2

But, my goodness.

You have now converted

3

the Eleventh Amendment, clearly designed to enhance the

4

sovereignty into the States ­­ of the States, into what

5

Chief Justice Rehnquist called in Hall an albatross

6

around their neck, that they are the one party that is

7

least favored, even compared to an ordinary litigant.

8

That can't be right.

9

And of course, the granddaddy of all of the

10

anomalies here is that the idea that Chisholm could have

11

sued Georgia in South Carolina State Court.

12

This Court doesn't lightly overrule its

13

precedents, but when it's faced with an anomaly that

14

dramatic and that inconsistent with the founders'

15

understanding, it's time to overrule.
