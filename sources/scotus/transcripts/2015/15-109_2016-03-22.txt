ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. MARTINEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

When an FTCA action is dismissed under

12

Section 2680, the resulting judgment of dismissal

13

triggers the judgment bar for two basic reasons.

14

the bar applies to any FTCA judgment, and a 2680

15

dismissal counts as a judgment under any sensible

16

definition of that term.

17

First,

Second, 2680 dismissals implicate the bar's

18

core purpose, which is to protect the government, its

19

functions, and its employees from the burdens and

20

disruptions associated with multiple lawsuits over the

21

same subject matter ­­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I ask you a

23

question?

24

that are exempted under the Act are Bivens claims, which

25

are constitutional violations.

And that is ­­ meaning ­­ the only claims

Why is it that an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

employee who has committed a constitutional violation is

2

now immune from suit merely because the plaintiff's

3

lawyer made a mistake and didn't file a Bivens claim

4

first?

5

MR. MARTINEZ:

Your Honor, the core purpose

6

of the judgment bar, as this Court recognized in Will v.

7

Hallock, is to protect the government from having to

8

litigate multiple times over the same claim.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so ­­

I don't blame you for

10

that, but you didn't litigate multiple times here.

11

exemption applied immediately, and the case was over.

12

MR. MARTINEZ:

Oh, with respect, Your Honor,

13

we did litigate multiple times.

The plaintiff ­­

They were both

MR. MARTINEZ:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
So if the court had

21

elected to address the Bivens claim first, the bar would

22

have been avoided.

23

MR. MARTINEZ:

Well, I think the two cases

24

were brought in two different actions.

25

several months after the other.

One was brought

And the FTCA action,

which is the one that obviously Congress was considering

2

when it enacted the judgment bar, was one that took over

3

three years to conclude, counting the three different

4

appeals that the plaintiff took ­­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That still doesn't

6

answer my point, which is, if the district court had

7

chosen to answer the Bivens claim first, there would be

8

no bar in place.

MR. MARTINEZ:

Your Honor, I think that

19

foreclose or close the courtroom door, because the work

20

is too hard to get to?

MR. MARTINEZ:

No, not at all, Your Honor.

The ­­ the ­­ the courtroom door is never closed to the

He could have litigated the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

I think what's important to realize here is

2

that what Congress did when it enacted the FTCA was

3

essentially create a new remedy and offer a bargain

4

to ­­ to tort victims, and it said, look, we're going to

5

create a brand new remedy directly against the United

6

States for money damages.

7

but if you accept the deal, if you accept the bargain,

8

and you choose to bring an FTCA case, and then you

9

choose to litigate that case all the way to judgment,

10

you can't turn around and seek relief under a totally

11

separate claim involving the same facts.

12

sensible and fair bargain.

13
14
15

It's a great deal for you,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's a very

not be brought against the government.

21

would be no preclusion here, because there was no

possibility of bringing the Bivens claim against the

government, and claim preclusion would apply only to

claims that could have been brought.

The Bivens claim is

So if you

So you couldn't

It would have to be a separate claim.

2

MR. MARTINEZ:

Your Honor, I think that the

3

judgment bar doesn't merely embrace a rule of res

4

judicata, it embraces a different rule that turns on the

5

application of a judgment.

6

Congress did in the Westfall Act, there's no question

7

that Congress wanted to preserve the option for the

8

plaintiff to bring a Bivens claim, and there's nothing

9

in our theory of this case that precludes ­­ that would

Now, with respect to what

10

have precluded the plaintiff from bringing that Bivens

11

claim at the outset.

12

But it's very interesting, and I think it's

13

very telling what Congress did in the Westfall Act,

14

as ­­ as you adverted to.

15

Westfall Act, Congress specifically said that the

16

exclusivity provision that it had enacted in 2679(b)(1)

17

would not apply to Bivens claims.

18

carved out an exception for such claims.

In Section 2679(b)(2) of the

And so it expressly

19

But when it did that, it did not carve out a

20

similar exception for Bivens claims to the judgment bar,

21

which is the separate provision in section 2676 that's

22

at issue in this case.

23

exception to essentially say to plaintiffs, you can

24

still bring your Bivens claim at the outset, but it

25

didn't disrupt the original bargain at the heart of the

And so Congress created an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

8
1

FTCA, which is that once you bring an FTCA claim, once

2

you litigate that claim all the way to judgment, you

3

can't try to take a second bite of the apple by having a

4

separate claim pending at the same time.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

You would have a nice, clean

6

textual argument if you were willing to argue that

7

"judgment" means "judgment"; it means any judgment.

8

in your reply brief, you say that perhaps a technical or

9

a procedural judgment is not a judgment under the

10

judgment bar provision.

11

is a technical or procedural judgment?

12

MR. MARTINEZ:

So what does that mean?

But

What

So I think, first of all, I

13

think our primary position is that judgment does mean

14

judgment in the sense that it's defined.

15

give nine different dictionary definitions at pages 19

16

to 20 of our brief, and I think it ­­ it's ­­ we think

17

the ­­ the most sensible reading of judgment is the way

18

it's ordinarily used in legal parlance.

19

I think we

Now, that said, we do acknowledge in our

20

reply brief that a couple of those definitions,

21

including the ones that we ­­ we reproduced, we weren't

22

trying to cherry pick definitions.

23

reproduced ­­ I think there were six of them from

24

Black's Law Dictionary from 1933 that we reproduced.

25

And I think three of those definitions seem to say that

Alderson Reporting Company

We just

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

9
1

a judgment has to resolve issues of the parties' rights

2

or issues of liabilities.

3

don't think this is the best reading, but it's possible,

4

if you only applied one of those three definitions, that

5

maybe certain kinds of dismissals that are based on

6

curable procedural defects that really don't get to the

7

liability issue in the case at all, it's possible

8

that ­­ that those might not count as judgments.

9

don't think this case presents that.

10
11
12

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it's possible ­­ again, we

But we

Why wouldn't a dismissal for

lack of jurisdiction be a procedural judgment?
MR. MARTINEZ:

I think in ­­ in many cases a

13

dismissal for lack of jurisdiction could well be a

14

procedural judgment, but not in this case, because 2680

15

dismissals are special and unique insofar as they are

16

jurisdictional, as both parties agree.

17

substantive, as this Court has said many, many times

18

over and over again, in cases like Indian Towing and

19

cases like Levin, most recently, just a few terms ago.

20

So when ­­ when the Court says ­­ looks at

But they're also

21

an FTCA case, and the Court says there is no ­­ there is

22

no liability here for the United States government and

23

gets rid of the case, even if it puts the jurisdictional

24

label on the dismissal, if it adjudicates the case under

25

2680, it's making a substantive determination that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

10
1

there's no liability.

2

that ­­ that my ­­ my friend on the other side would

3

disagree with that.

And I actually don't think

4

I think in his own brief at pages 11 and 12,

5

he makes clear that a 2680 dismissal means that there is

6

no liability for the ­­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No liability on the part

8

of the Federal government under the FTCA, but it's ­­

9

it's no judgment at all with respect to the Bivens claim

10

which depends on the employee's conduct.

11

no adjudication at all of the employee's conduct in the

12

first action.

13

MR. MARTINEZ:

Right.

There's been

The first action

14

often will not even often involve a Bivens claim, but I

15

think the question ­­ the reason we're discussing this

16

particular point is because we're trying to figure out

17

what the meaning of the word "judgment" is in Section 26

18

of the FTCA.

19

adjudication of a particular FTCA case would qualify as

20

a judgment, and I think there's no question that when an

21

FTCA case is adjudicated and is conclusively resolved in

22

favor of the government on the basis of one of the 2680

23

exceptions, it's true that that's jurisdictional, but

24

it's also a substantive adjudication of the claim.

25

So we're trying to figure out whether the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Martinez ­­

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Go ahead.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If I could ask you about

4

the ­­ what I take to be the Respondent's primary

5

argument in the case now, which is the meaning of this

6

phrase "the provisions of this chapter in Section

7

1346(b) shall not apply" ­­

8

MR. MARTINEZ:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
­­ and of course, that would

10

include the judgment bar.

11

for all it's worth, it says that the judgment bar shall

12

not apply.

13

So if you take that provision

So what is your response to that?
MR. MARTINEZ:

Well, I think we have two ­­

14

two responses.

15

that we developed the most fully in our reply brief ­­

16

is that that language does not mean what he say it ­­

17

what he says it means.

18

means what this Court has essentially said in a number

19

of cases, most clearly in the Dolan case involving the

20

Postal Service about ten years ago, and what ­­ what the

21

Court said there was that the 2680 exceptions, that

22

whole provision, set forth exceptions to the

23

government's ­­ to the United States waiver of sovereign

24

immunity.

25

immunity as being effected in two different provisions

Our main response ­­ and this is the one

We think that that language

And it identified that waiver of sovereign

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

12

of the FTCA.

2

provision, and 2674, the liability provision.

3

That's 1346(b), the jurisdictional

So we interpret that introductory language,

4

the way this Court has interpreted it in cases like

5

Dolan, and said the same thing ­­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That really does make the ­­

7

the language something it's not.

8

provisions of this chapter in 1346(b), that's what the

9

provision says, you're essentially reading it to say

Instead of the

10

Section 2674 of this chapter and Section 1346(b).

11

that's a real shift in what the language actually says.

12

MR. MARTINEZ:

So

Well, I think I would say two

13

things to that, Your Honor.

14

that's consistent with the way that the Court has

15

interpreted 2680 in the prior cases like Dolan and Levin

16

that I just mentioned.

17

the Court already considered and rejected this exact

18

argument about the introductory language, the "shall not

19

apply" language, and it rejected that argument in the

20

Smith case, United States v. Smith.

21

First of all, we think

But more fundamentally, I think

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, that case ­­

Could you point out

22

where, in that case, we explicitly addressed that

23

language and rejected it?

24

MR. MARTINEZ:

25

You didn't explicitly discuss

that language, but the holding of the case was that one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

13
1

of the provisions of this Chapter 2679(b) did apply to a

2

2680 claim.

3

inconsistent with the idea ­­ the argument that

4

provisions of this chapter ­­

today.

15

MR. MARTINEZ:

In response to Justice

16

Sotomayor's point, Justice Sotomayor suggested that

17

maybe the Court didn't address it explicitly, and that's

18

true, but I want to emphasize that the parties did raise

19

this argument, and we briefed this argument at some

20

length in our merits brief, so ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

2679 is different, though,

22

right?

23

exceptions shall be applicable to FTCA actions.

24

although the Court didn't directly confront this issue,

25

what it might have said, if it had confronted the issue,

Because 2679, the text of it, says that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14
1

was something like, well, 2679, which comes along later,

2

and says all the exceptions are applicable to FTCA

3

actions, essentially says ­­ creates an exception to the

4

general rule of inapplicability.

5

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think ­­ I ­­ I think that

6

that would not be the best reading of Smith, because I

7

think that would suggest that the Court saw some sort of

8

conflict between the umbrella language, the introductory

9

clause, and Section 2679(b)(4), which is what you're

10

talking about.

11

I actually think 2679(b)(4) helps us,

12

because what it shows is that Congress shared our

13

understanding of what the "shall not apply" language

14

means.

15

the one that says the exceptions do apply to Section

16

2679(b) cases.

But in terms of the analysis of it,

MR. MARTINEZ:

Right.

Just to step back and

let me set the stage.
So in ­­ in Smith, the plaintiff in that

11

case, had made the "shall not apply" language argument

12

that Respondent makes here.

13

opposition to certiorari.

14

It made it in its brief in
It was made at page 21.

The government then devoted a significant

15

chunk of its brief at pages 19 to 24 to refute that

16

argument, and I think probably because the argument ­­

17

the government made a fairly compelling case, the

18

plaintiff then asserted that argument only in one page

19

of his response brief at page 44, and then he raised it

20

at oral argument on page 35.

21

were correct, that would have meant that Smith would

22

have had had to come out the other way.

of issues, and maybe there were alternative grounds and

number of reasons.

made in Smith ­­ so even if Smith were not on the table,

14

that's the hypothesis.

15

2679(b)(1) that were at issue in Smith, I think the

2679(b)(1) clearly applies to cases involving claims

18

that fall into the 2680 exceptions.

true as a matter of the text of the FTCA.

First of all, the arguments that we

11

that the ­­ what ­­ what 2680, what that language says

12

is the provisions of the chapter don't apply to

13

categories of potential claims.

14

don't apply to claims.

First of all, just as a textual matter, we think

15

So the word is they

The judgment bar doesn't operate on the

16

basis of claims; it operates on the basis of judgments.

17

It talks about an FTCA judgment.

18

A judgment and a claim are obviously

19

different.

20

before it's been adjudicated or while it's being

21

adjudicated ­­

22
23

A claim is an assertion of a legal right

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's slicing the bologna

pretty thin.

24

(Laughter.)

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, you know, they're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

20
1

trying to set up language that applies to a whole bunch

2

of different provisions and saying, you know, all of

3

these provisions don't apply in the context of lawsuits,

4

basically.

5

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think that ­­ I think that

6

if ­­ even if you think that that's slicing the bologna

7

too thin, I don't think you need to resolve the case on

8

the basis of that argument because I think there are two

9

additional very strong reasons to reject their reading

10

of the introductory clause in addition to Smith, which

11

we've already talked about.

12

The ­­ the next reason is that it's ­­ that

13

that reading of Smith is inconsistent with numerous

14

other provisions of the original FTCA.

15

Justice Kagan, you just said that, you know,

16

the plain text seems to say that they wanted to exempt

17

2680 claims from all of the provisions of the FTCA, and

18

arguably, that's what the literal language seems to say.

19

But if you look at the original FTCA, that ­­ that

20

cannot possibly be what ­­ what that language means.

21

And so let me point you just to four different

22

provisions of the original FTCA that don't seem to make

23

sense under that reading.

24
25

The first of those provisions is Section 402
of the original FTCA, and we've reproduced that at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

21
1

page 10a of the appendix to our brief.

2

the definitional provision which defines certain key

3

terms for use throughout in the ­­ throughout the FTCA,

4

and it defines several terms that are used in multiple

5

places within 2680.

Section 402 is

6

So if Respondent's theory were correct that

7

the other provisions of ­­ every other provision of the

8

FTCA doesn't apply to 2680 claims, those definitions

9

wouldn't apply to 2680 claims ­­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now that's where the

11

Respondents use an argument very much like the one you

12

just used.

13

isn't that right?

14

They say definitions don't apply to claims;

MR. MARTINEZ:

Well, I ­­ I think if it's

15

slicing the bologna thin for us, it's slicing the

16

bologna thin for them.

And ­­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

MR. MARTINEZ:

It's a wash.
The good news for us is that

19

we have three other provisions that I think also don't

20

make any sense based on their reading.

21

look at Section 411 of the original FTCA, and that's at

22

page 12a of our brief, Section 411 is the one that

23

applies the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

24
25

And so if you

Now obviously, the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure are supposed to be used to adjudicate claims

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

22
1

that fall within 2680.

2

statute, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would

3

appear not to apply.

4
5

If you look to the very next page and the
very next provision ­­

6
7

But in their reading of the

JUSTICE ALITO:
Do you need a provision?

8

MR. MARTINEZ:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

Wouldn't they apply anyway?

Congress ­­
Specifically saying that

they would apply?

11

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think you probably didn't,

12

but Congress seemed to think that you did.

13

the other statutes, like the Tucker Act and like the

14

Suits and Admiralty Act where the ­­ where Congress is

15

waiving the sovereign immunity of the United States, it

16

thought it needed to set forth a specific provision in

17

the statute waiving sovereign immunity applying the

18

civil rules.

19

And in all

And in fact, the Fifth Circuit in the case,

20

just five ­­ five or six years before the FTCA was

21

passed, had said that the rules would not apply to a

22

Tucker Act claim.

23

had this problem in mind and was trying to address that.

24
25

So I think Congress was ­­ clearly

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why is that bad?

So ­­ I

mean, look, as I read it simply, if I can, you look at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

23
1

the top of 2680, "The provisions of this chapter shall

2

3

them is an action rising a claim based on a foreign

country.

And then we have a long list.

One of

5

So I bring a lawsuit.

6

This says the FTCA doesn't apply.

7

know, if it doesn't apply, that means the definitions

8

don't apply.

9

So I say fine.
MR. MARTINEZ:

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

I was hurt in Mexico.
And so you say, you

It doesn't apply.

But if you would ­­
And if I say ­­ you say the

11

Rules of Civil Procedure don't apply.

12

applies.

13

MR. MARTINEZ:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. MARTINEZ:

Fine.

Nothing

Right.
You don't have an action.
But if you file the action

16

anyway, and then the Court is adjudicating the action,

17

and at issue in the action is whether, for example,

18

the ­­ the action involves a Federal agency, which is a

19

defined term, or an employee of the government, which is

20

a defined term, then you would have to ­­ ordinarily you

21

would ­­ you would think that the definitional

22

provisions would shed light on that question.

23

And so if you are correct, though, that ­­

24

that the definitional provision doesn't apply, then you

25

wouldn't know where to look for the definitions.

Alderson Reporting Company

And if

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

24
1

you were to lose that case, and ­­ and if the government

2

were to win and you wanted to take an appeal, your right

3

to appeal is also one of the provisions of this chapter,

4

and that's Section 412(a) of the original FTCA, and

5

that's reproduced at page 13a of our brief.

6

And so there's a ­­ the FTCA created a

7

special appellate review provision that essentially gave

8

parties an option to take an appeal either to the ­­ the

9

circuit courts or to the court of claims.

10

So it's a

special FTCA­specific provision.

11

But under Respondent's theory, that appeal

12

provision wouldn't apply because it's one of the other

13

provisions of this ­­ of this chapter.

14
15

And then the final provision I want to point

what Respondent says.

course, makes perfect sense because Congress didn't want

applicability of the 2680 exceptions.

25

And he says that ­­ that this, of

confronted if the government appealed the 2680

Respondent says the court of claims wasn't supposed to

9

be considering.

10

First of all, if the government were to lose

It could then take an appeal to the court of

Moreover, when ­­ when Congress recodified

11

the FTCA's appellate review provisions in 1948, just two

12

years later, it sent the provision allowing appeals

14

a different provision.

15

within Chapter 171.

16

the court of claims' jurisdiction was, it said that the

17

court had jurisdiction over any action brought under the

It's ­­ it's not a provision

Now, we agree with Respondents that the

recodification didn't change the meaning of the original

problem as of the original FTCA, and it creates

The appellate review provision,

10

interestingly, has been ­­ or has been sent to a

11

different provision ­­ has been sent outside ­­ outside

12

of Chapter 171.

13

The one that matters the most is ­­ is

14

Section 2679(a), and that's the provision that says that

15

the FTCA is the exclusive remedy and precludes State

16

tort suits against agencies that would otherwise have

17

been suable understand there sue­and­be­sued authority.

18

And the idea behind that provision is to put,

19

essentially, all Federal agencies on the same footing,

20

whether or not they have independent authority to sue

21

and be sued when it comes to tort claims.

22

If ­­ if ­­ under Respondent's theory,

23

Section 2679(a)'s protections did not apply to 2680

24

claims.

25

sue­and­be­sued authority are now subject to such

And what that means is that agencies that have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

28
1

claims.

2

Now, that ­­ that would, in very practical

3

terms, would massively expand the United States

4

government direct liability for ­­ for ­­ in tort.

5

I think the biggest problem, and the most concrete

6

example I can give you is with respect to the Postal

7

Service.

8
9

And

Now, we know from Section 2680(b) of the
FTCA that Congress wanted to eliminate the possibility

10

that the government would be liable for the loss of mail

11

or for the negligent transmission of ­­ of mail.

12

the Postal Service has independent sue­and­be­sued

13

authority.

14

apply, then what that means, essentially, is that the

15

Postal Service can now be sued under his theory for

negligently transmitting the mail.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTIAN VERGONIS

25

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

30
1
2

MR. VERGONIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

Through Section 2680 and the judgment bar,

4

Congress has established a fair and sensible statutory

5

scheme where the government accepts derivative superior

6

liability for the torts of its employees, a plaintiff

7

who tries his claim against the government may not seek

8

a second bite at the apple or duplicative recovery by

9

suing the employee personally.

That's the fair bargain.

10

But where the United States has not waived

11

derivative liability, the judgment bar is not a gotcha

12

provision that prevents a plaintiff who sued the wrong

13

defendant from thereafter suing the correct defendant,

14

the primarily liable employee.

15

of the bargain.

16

Section 2680 makes this perfectly clear.

17

Those claims are outside

And the "shall not apply" directive of

As some of the Justices recognized during

18

counsel's presentation, that language says that the

19

other provisions of the Act shall not apply.

20

unambiguously includes the judgment bar.

This

And there's no inconsistency between that

22

understanding of the "shall not apply" language and any

23

of the other clauses or any of this Court's cases.

14

combined with legislative history that Smith examined,

course by the circuit.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I can see that, but ­­ that

12

is, imagine a plaintiff and the plaintiff brings a

13

lawsuit against the Post Office for negligence.

14

government's defense is that this is a discretionary

15

function, a particular thing.

16

you're right, it's a discretionary function.

17

it's dismissed.

18

The

And the plaintiff says,
And now

All right.

Now, if that last thing he read doesn't

19

apply because it was discretionary function and fell

20

within 2680, they then could see the Post Office on the

21

basis that the Post Office has independent authority to

22

sue or be sued.

23

Congress somehow, when they passed these words, "does

24

not apply", suddenly wanted to revive all kinds of suits

25

against, for example, the Post Office, which otherwise

And it's hard to believe, he says, that

Alderson Reporting Company

would have been barred by that last provision that he

2

read.

3

MR. VERGONIS:

And the Post Office is a

4

great example, Your Honor, because when Congress enacted

5

the sue­and­be­sued clause for the Post Office, they

6

inserted another provision now at 39 U.S.C.,

7

Section 409, which said that tort claims against the

8

Post Office shall be subject to the provisions of the

9

Federal Tort Claims Act.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

So we don't have to worry

11

about the Post Office, the example that he gave.

12

there may be others.

13

mean, do we know what we're talking about?

14

try to know what I'm talking about.

15

what the reach of exempting that last provision from ­­

16

just erasing it in a discretionary action suit will be?

17

But

Sue and be sued is a fairly ­­ I

MR. VERGONIS:

I like to

And do we know here

Two answers to that.

The

18

discretionary function exception is a common­law

19

exception, so it may be that suable agencies have that

20

defense available to them anyway.

21

FTCA was created as a common­law defense.

22

It existed before the

So the suable agencies who could be sued

23

again can raise other defenses, as this Court held in

24

FDIC v. Meyer, just because a suable agency can be sued

25

on a claim doesn't mean that the claim exists against

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

37
1

the suable agency.

2

2680 are suable agencies themselves.

3

And three of the exceptions under

So if you read 2679 as applying to the

4

exceptions, their reading of the statute, you create a

5

situation where, say, the Panama Canal Company is

6

sued ­­ well, 2679 on their reading bars that suit

7

against the Panama Canal Company and makes the FTCA

8

exclusive, but then 2680 under the FTCA bars the claim

9

against the ­­ arising out of the activities of the

10

Panama Canal Company.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

So ­­ so you're ­­ can I ­­

12

are you saying this, in essence?

13

other provisions that aren't erased, even if there

14

aren't, this particular erasure means that in an action

15

that is dismissed ­­ an action against the government ­­

16

for the reasons listed in those exceptions ­­ for

MR. VERGONIS:

Even if there are

It's a different

That's our position, and ­­

23

and you can only sue the employee today on

constitutional tort claims under Bivens.

But you're saying any

claim, if it falls within ­­ if the reason for the bar,

2

if the reason for the dismissal falls within the

exception, and if they wanted to change that, they

4

should have said so.

5
6

MR. VERGONIS:
right, Your Honor.

7

That's ­­ that's exactly

And ­­ and ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is ­­ is that another way

8

of saying that the judgment bar applies just to

9

judgments of the merits, or is that somewhat different

10

from your argument?

11
12
13

MR. VERGONIS:
Your Honor.

That's one of our arguments,

We get to the same result ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Isn't that the same as the

14

argument you just made?

15

if ­­ if we think Smith was an interpretation of ­­ of

16

2680, and you had to get around Smith and it's awkward

17

to do it, what's your second argument?

18

argument you're now making to Justice Breyer, or is it

19

different from saying that what we're talking about is

20

judgment on the merits?

21

MR. VERGONIS:

Because I'm curious to know,

Is that the

Well, as I ­­ as I

22

understood, Justice Breyer's question was the

23

consequences of our argument, and our three arguments

24

lead to the same consequences.

25

take the position that "judgment" means a judgment that

But, yes, Your Honor, we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

39
1
2

would, under the common law, have preclusive effect.
So if you move away from the "shall not

3

apply" language, which we think is the most

4

straightforward way of resolving this case, and to the

5

language of the judgment bar itself, we have two

6

arguments under the judgment bar.

7

One is that the judgment bar is only

8

triggered by an action under Section 1346(b).

9

again, the "shall not apply" language says 1346(b) shall

And,

10

not apply to the excepted claims.

11

not a judgment ­­ a 2680 dismissal is not a judgment

12

under the FTCA.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Therefore, this is

What of the government's

14

argument that once you get wind that a 2680 exception is

15

going to get the government off the hook, before a

16

judgment is entered, which might raise the judgment bar,

17

you can voluntarily ­­ voluntarily dismiss your case

18

against the government so you won't face a judgment?

19

You can amend your complaint, if ­­ if you sued them

20

both originally, to drop the government, or you can take

21

a voluntary dismissal.

22

What ­­ how do you answer that?

23

MR. VERGONIS:

I think once you've ­­ once

24

they've answered the complaint, Your Honor, I don't

25

think the plaintiff can just dismiss or amend the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

40
1

complaint without seeking leave from the Court, which

2

may result in a judgment of dismissal.

3

of voluntary dismissal, as I understand their view, that

4

"judgment" means any judgment would trigger the judgment

5

bar, under that reading.

6

Even a judgment

So to return to Justice Kennedy's question,

7

on judgment in particular, we think it incorporates

8

principles of res judicata.

9

principles of res judicata to inform the word "judgment"

10

And the Court has looked to

in other contexts.

11

In the relitigation exception to the

12

Anti­Injunction Act, the Federal courts are empowered to

13

enjoin State court proceedings to protect or effectuate

14

judgments of the Federal courts, and this Court has

15

viewed that as ­­ viewed judgment errors incorporating

16

principles of res judicata, and only judgments with res

17

judicata effect can be enjoined under that relitigation

18

provision.

19

I think that's a great analogy to this case.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I take you back to the

20

"shall not apply" language for a second?

21

you were speaking to the Chief Justice, you said, well,

22

the definitional section will continue to apply because

23

definitions apply to terms and not to claims.

24
25

When ­­ when

But then Mr. Martinez said something very
similar to that.

He said the judgment bar applies to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

41
1

judgments, not claims.

2

why isn't he right as well?

3

being right was ­­ is that he would have taken the

4

judgment bar out of that sweeping "shall not apply"

5

language as well.

6

So if you're right as to that,

MR. VERGONIS:

And the consequence of his

The judgment bar actually

9

claimant by reason of the same subject matter against

15

It's agreed to subject itself to respondeat superior

liability on the claim.

22

for which the government has not accepted respondeat

superior liability, the bar on bringing that claim

25

So when you have an intentional tort claim

So it's ­­ it's not the context of where you

6

It's ­­ it's actually an

JUSTICE ALITO:

And it's,

To go back to the point you

7

were making before, under your interpretation, does the

8

judgment bar add anything to principles of claim

9

preclusion?

10

MR. VERGONIS:

We think so, Your Honor.

11

think that's ­­ understanding the principles of claim

MR. VERGONIS:

with modern principles of res judicata, where we've

17

developed nonmutality and defendants are able to assert

18

defense uses of res judicata.

19

think this is a strong contextual clue of what Congress

20

was trying to accomplish with this provision ­­ a

21

judgment against an employee would be preclusive against

22

a claim against the employer on the same subject matter.

23

And that's because of reasons of potential

24

indemnification by the employee owed to the employer so

25

that the employee could potentially be sued twice on the

It would not have then.
And ­­ and this case, this type of case

23

where a claim is dismissed on a jurisdictional ground

JUSTICE ALITO:

The

So you want us to decide

this case based on a literal reading of 2680.

But the

10

Sixth Circuit did not decide the case on that ground,

11

and we don't have to address that, do we?

12

So why should we not decide whether the

13

Sixth Circuit was correct in its reasoning and apply the

14

same literal reading approach that you recommend to ­­

15

with respect to 2680 to the judgment bar, and hold that

16

a judgment is a judgment, and not necessarily a judgment

17

on the merits?

18

is, as I think the argument has shown, is very

19

complicated.

20

And then ­­ because the issue under 2680

MR. VERGONIS:

Two points, Your Honor:

21

First, I don't think the argument was waived.

argument.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

This is

It's a separate

it's another ground for affirmance, correct?

Alderson Reporting Company

It's an

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

45

alternative grounds for affirmance, which we have

2

discretion to decide whether we want to reach or not.

3

MR. VERGONIS:

I think it's an alternative

4

argument for the same ground for affirmance.

5

question presented was whether a 2680 dismissal triggers

6

the judgment bar.

7

two provisions, and it would be very artificial for the

8

Court to ignore the text of one of those provisions and

9

focus solely on the text of the other provision.

10

The

This case is about the interaction of

Substantively, I think the term "judgment"

11

is an ambiguous term whereas the term "shall not apply"

12

is not an ambiguous term.

13

things in different contexts.

14

things within the different provisions of the Act.

15

some of the provisions of the Act, it seems to me, mean

16

a ward against the government.

as a percent of the judgment.

18

judgment is to be paid.

19

"Judgment" can mean different

That's 2672.

So "judgment" is an inherently ambiguous

20

word, and the Court would need to grapple with that

21

ambiguity if it tries to resolve the case that way.

22

And again, I think the issue was raised in

23

our bio.

24

so I think the Court really, in order to answer the

25

second part of the question intelligently, the Court

It's logically intertwined with the question,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. RAMIREZ:

10
11

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I have two main points that I'd like to
make.

12

First, with respect to the Postal Service,

13

it's true that the Postal Reorganization Act says that

14

the FTCA applies to torts that involve the Postal

15

Service.

16

FTCA's protections of sue­and­be­sued agencies doesn't

17

protect sue­and­be­sued agencies from claims that

18

involve the exceptions within 2680.

19

argument, the ­­ the postal ­­ the postal service,

20

because ­­ because if it's faced with a claim involving

21

the negligent transmission of mail, the Postal Service

22

would not be able to take advantage of 2679(a)'s

23

protections.

24
25

But Respondent's whole argument is that the

And so by his own

I think the Court might want to look to the
First Circuit's decision in the Davric case, where it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

47
1

addressed this issue.

2

"shall not apply" argument, and it said that it would

3

lead to results that Congress could not have conceivably

4

intended, and we agree with that.

5

It rejected Respondent's

The second point I'd like to make is just

6

about the ­­ the purpose of the FTCA.

7

Congress very clearly wanted to give victims a choice

8

between suing the government and suing the responsible

9

employee directly, but it didn't want to force the

10

We think that

government to litigate over the same facts twice.

11

That purpose is squarely implicated.

It's

12

not superfluous.

13

under modern rules because, even today, if the ­­ if the

14

government has to defend indirectly against a Bivens

15

action and also has to defend against an FTCA action,

16

the same concerns about alleviating the burdens and

17

disruptions appear today as ­­ just as they would have

18

in 1946.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

choice.

21

action.

22

The judgment bar is not superfluous

That's the government's

They're not obliged to defend the Bivens

MR. RAMIREZ:

That's true.

But I think when

23

Congress enacted the FTCA, it recognized, as a practical

24

matter, that the government, when ­­ when ­­ was

25

typically stepping into conduct the defense of employees

Alderson Reporting Company

original FTCA.
