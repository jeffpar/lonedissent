ORAL ARGUMENT BY STUART B. LEV

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. LEV:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Due process does not allow a district

11

attorney to make the decision to seek the death penalty

12

against the defendant, and then in the same case become

13

a judge of the conduct of the prosecutor who carried out

14

that decision and obtained that result.

15

In this case, at ­­ when he was district

16

attorney, Chief Justice Castille made a discretionary

17

individualized decision based upon a review of the facts

18

that in his view, death was the appropriate sentence to

19

seek.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does that make a

21

difference, the nature of his decision?

22

had a policy.

23

defendant is convicted of first degree murder, that we

24

ought to seek the death penalty and leave it to the

25

jury.

Let's say he

He says, I think every case in which a

Maybe the jury will agree or not, but I'm going

Alderson Court Reporting

to seek the death penalty in every case where there's a

2

conviction of first degree murder.

3

Would you have the same recusal problem?

4

MR. LEV:

I think there would be, yes,

5

because that policy itself would be a decision that he

6

makes.

7

Pennsylvania law gives the district attorney ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, no, I know that,

8

but it's a categorical decision.

9

doesn't look at the particulars of that case.

In other words, he
He has a

10

policy that he's adopted ­­ you know, whether you think

11

it's a good policy or not ­­ that doesn't depend upon

12

the particular facts, simply on the facts of what the

13

conviction is.

14

MR. LEV:

That would still raise due process

15

concerns, because that policy would have led to a major

16

decision within the adversary process.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what if the case was

18

simply in the office and he had supervisory

19

responsibility over everything that occurs in the

20

office, but it's a big office.

21

somebody could bring it to him, but there isn't any

22

indication of personal involvement.

23

enough?

24
25

MR. LEV:

If a question arose,

Would that be

Supervisory authority might be

enough, depending upon the issue.

Alderson Court Reporting

When the issue goes

15

way or the other ­­ but how far does this go?

16

that's what I'm ­­ that's what I'm interested in.

you said, but it depends on the issue?

20

MR. LEV:

22

And

Why would it

Because the issue is directly

related to that supervisory authority.

23

rule, then, that you're formulating, so that we can

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I ­­ I thought that

your ­­ your particular position was that a judge cannot

sit on any case where, as the district attorney, he

signed on to the death penalty.

9

MR. LEV:

That would be, Your Honor, an

10

appropriate decision, an appropriate due process rule

11

for this Court to reach, but it's not a rule you need to

reach in this case.

is?

6

Under that answer, then,

why doesn't the Brady violation problem drop out of the

And that's not an argument for ­­ for ­­ an extra

Brady violation goes directly to his role in making the

5

decision.

penalty.

8

as the chief prosecutor.

head of the office.

6

MR. LEV:

I think more importantly, Justice

Kennedy, that the Brady violation fits in because that

is how the trial prosecutor carried out the decision

District Attorney Castille looked at in making that

decision and showed that it was he who made that

One is the memorandum that authorized

We didn't have that before.

The second factor would be the fact that it
was a Brady issue, and that there had been evidence that

10

had been suppressed and findings by a lower court judge

11

that the prosecutor had done so willfully.

12

those two factors that were new to the case that caused

us to file the recusal motion.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it was

think sandbagging, for whatever concern, can be

reason to narrow or not apply a due process analysis.

Well, I guess it's

You want

10

Chief Justice Castille recused, and the other justices

11

on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court say we think that he

12

should be recused, and we're afraid that if we go ahead

13

with this decision with his participation, the decision

14

is going to be subject to attack down the road.

15

can't allow that to happen, so we're going to require

16

him to be recused in order to prevent him from tainting

17

our decision­making process or creating at least the

appearance that the decision­making process is tainted.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

Petitioner argues that it is Judge

Castille's supposed direct and personal and substantial

involvement with this case that creates the

constitutional due process recusal obligation.

he has said here today, such direct involvement in the

case is actually not necessary to his argument at all.

He has said that if the D.A. merely promulgated a policy

5

responsibility personally, as he claimed during the

clearly individual review here.

And so I'm ­­ I'm ­­ what does

And there was

At ­­ at what point do we give meaning to

10

the constitutional command that you can't be prosecutor

11

and judge?

I know there's so many different kinds of

12

recusals.

This is the ideal case for someone to make a

13

due process claim, because the judge here actually

14

signed his name to his review of the facts and his

15

decision to seek the death penalty.

16

What ­­ as I'm looking at most of the

17

ethical codes, most of the ethical codes would have said

Your Honor, I think that's

exactly the point, that the ­­ that it's the ethical

situation.

23

is not the ideal case at all.

MR. EISENBERG:

And that as a constitutional question, this

But don't you think, as a reasonable

MR. EISENBERG:

I think, Your Honor, that

21

after 30 years, maybe everybody wouldn't see it that

22

way, especially if they looked at the rest of his

23

record, as you have referred to.

24
25

And I think that the major point, Your
Honor, is that any sort of prior conduct by a judge in

Alderson Court Reporting

Official

29
1

his prior life that gives rise to a ­­ an intolerable

2

probability of actual bias as the test, it's not limited

3

in some way to prosecutors, or even to people who

4

previously had some brief involvement as counsel in a

5

case.

6

So as the Court has said, one looks at the

7

psychological tendencies of human beings.

8

the Court addressed in Caperton.

9

are many cases, as ­­ as Justice Breyer has referred to,

That's what

And we know that there

10

where judges or justices have been far more involved in

11

an issue that came before the court, once they became a

12

judge or justice later on, than Justice Castille was in

13

this case.

14

There are many instances where judges or

15

justices worked on an issue, spearheaded an issue,

16

fought for legislation, for example, for years and years

17

and years, even may have had it named after them, and

18

then sat in judgment on the constitutionality or scope

19

of that legislation.

20

Now, I think that the public would see at

21

least as much potential for bias in a situation like

22

that, at least as much possibility that the ­­ that

23

given human psychology, a justice in that position would

24

be reluctant to overturn his or her own statute.

25

The reason that that's not a constitutional

Alderson Court Reporting

Official

30
1

violation is because I think that Caperton, and this

2

Court's law generally, recognize that judges are human

3

beings, they have prior lives, and that we don't want to

4

have a situation where the only people who can become

5

judges and sit on cases are people with no prior

6

experiences.

11

And Section 455 of 28 U.S.C., where we have rather

12

mechanical recusal standards, also refutes that.

13

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, Your Honor, my point

14

is not that there can be no bright lines adopted as a

15

matter of code or of statute.

16

And the court in Caperton was very clear to make clear

17

in extended discussion that the due process test is

18

merely a constitutional floor, and that the ceiling is

19

set by those codes and statutes.

draw those sort of bright line tests, Your Honor.

in fact, as follow up ­­

meet the Caperton standard of an intolerable likelihood

The Petitioner's position is that because we

So the fact that they didn't have the memo

argument.

And, in fact, Petitioner said here today that

Alderson Court Reporting

even if the district attorney had a flat policy and

2

didn't look at any individual cases, that would still be

a recusal problem.

participation or the involvement of other justices is ­­

is really one of the core problems here.

And if you look to ­­ to pick up on earlier

16

questions, if you look at this Court's historic

17

practices, as it's termed in recusal matters, it is to

18

refer a recusal motion to an individual justice, and

19

that's it.

20

Now, under Petitioner's approach, I think

21

that's seriously problematic, a difficulty for the

22

Court.

23

You have two options:

Either to continue

24

that practice, having held, if you adopt Petitioner's

25

point of view, that the failure to recuse, the erroneous

Alderson Court Reporting

Official

50
1

failure to recuse, taints the votes of every other

2

justice on the Court, but the Court declines to look at

3

the issue; or you adopt a new practice in which the

4

Court, in fact, looks at the recusal of ­­ the

5

individual recusal and makes a decision for itself,

6

which puts it in the position of deciding who the

7

members of the Court will be on any particular case.

this, and this line of argument.

decides whether to recuse, correct?

16

Under the IOPs, motions for reconsideration

17

go to the individual justice, not to the Chief Justice.

So if Petitioner's theory were correct, Justice Castille

19

could have blocked that reconsideration.

20

He recused himself and passed it on to the rest of the

court.

He did not.

When, under the IOPs, a matter is assigned

court decide due process­based recusal claims."

16

And I think on Petitioner's theory, that

the failure to decide it potentially taints the rest of

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART B. LEV

7

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. LEV:

9

Let's start with the passage of time.

Thank you.
In

10

our view, the passage of time isn't the relevant factor.

11

It's that it's the same case.

12

This is ­­ even though this case has lasted

13

a very, very long time through numerous different

14

hearings and delays, this is the same case.

15

you had was Chief Justice Castille participating in this

16

case as both the prosecutor and a judge in the same

17

case.

18

due process problem starts.

19

And so what

And that's where the problem ­­ that's where the

What separates this out from the ethical

20

rules is that this is an extreme and rare case.

21

what Caperton was talking about, where the ethical rules

22

were not sufficient to cover the problems here.

23

know that this is an extreme and rare case because

24

there's no other case like it, right?

25

case that Respondents have cited to, and none that we

Alderson Court Reporting

That's

And we

There's no other

found, where a judge in this situation has sat and

2

decided on the case.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, this may be an extreme

4

case, but if we do not say any personal participation

5

requires recusal under the Constitution, what other

6

clear line can you give us?

7

MR. LEV:

Well, to the extent that Caperton

8

is not a clear line, I think we're ­­ we're still with

9

Caperton.

If you want to clarify the line of Caperton,

10

it is about the ­­ the judge's participation in a

11

significant decision­making in the case.

12

issues before them are related to that decision­making,

13

that's ­­ that's the line I would suggest that you can

14

draw in this case.

15

And where the

On ­­ on question two, if you accept the

16

Respondent's position, what you would be saying is it's

17

okay to have one ­­ one biased judge on an appellate

18

panel, or two, or three, so long as a majority voted in

19

favor were not biased.

20

the Due Process Clause, the idea of fairness, the public

21

confidence in the integrity of the fairness of the

22

system requires that each judge be free from bias.

23

And that's not appropriate under

And lastly, I would say about referring to

24

the full court, we did that.

25

our motion to recuse that's in the Joint Appendix, I

We asked, if you look at

Alderson Court Reporting

think at Section 4 of our motion says if Judge Castille

2

denies this, we ask that the full court hear it.

3

Justice Castille, using his power as the Chief Justice,

4

blocked that.

5

recuse, and I'm going to deny referral to the full

6

court.

court hear it, and we weren't able to get that.
Thank you very much.
