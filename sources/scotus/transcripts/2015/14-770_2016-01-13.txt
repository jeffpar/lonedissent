ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. LAMKEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

For nearly 200 years, Congress never enacted

12

a statute that purported to limit the effect to one and

13

only one specified case pending before Article III

14

courts disclaiming any reach beyond that solitary

15

monetary dispute.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Lamken, is it one

case?

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it the ­­ is it the use

of the case name in the ­­ or the number in the statute

11

that is the offending characteristic?

12

I imagine that a ­­ a ­­ a creative drafter

13

could draft a statute that makes no reference to a

14

particular case or to particular cases but could put so

15

many limitations on the scope of the law that, in fact,

16

it applies only to one case or to a small number of

17

cases exactly the ones that Congress wants to target.

18

Congress does that; is it different?

19

MR. LAMKEN:

Right.

I ­­ I think, Your

20

Honor, if Congress so limits and so cabins it that, in

21

effect, it has limited the law to one and one case only,

22

it's inexplicable, except as an effort, to limit it to

rule as well.

25

That would fall within our

And the principle underlying that is that

Alderson Court Reporting

Congress enacts laws; it doesn't adjudicate specific

2

cases.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know, we ­­ we had a

case.

5

with Lampf, which ­­ which ­­ in which our Court had

6

come to a surprise decision which shortened what

7

everybody thought had been the statute of limitations

for certain securities actions.

Congress passed a law

trying to reverse our decision.

It said anybody who had

I think it dealt

filed the security action prior to the date of this

11

decision would be allowed to refile and proceed to

judgment.

13

Congress can't do that because it is reversing the

14

outcome of a court judgment.

15

to decide that case by saying, my Lord, it's just

16

referring to particular cases.

We went through a lot of trouble to say that

That statute said that

for the five statutory provisions that were at issue in

the cases, you could comply with those or you could

sufficient for the timber harvesting.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where do you get the notion

that Congress can only act by generality?

6

the basis of individual cases.

7

MR. LAMKEN:

It acts all

I mean, certainly, you

Justice Scalia, our principle

8

is not that Congress can't act on a certain bridge, a

9

single parcel of land, a single set of presidential

10

papers.

11

to one and only one case such that it dictates the

12

outcome.

13

It's that Congress cannot limit its legislation

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why is that?

So long as it

14

is not overturning a judgment that the court has made in

15

that case, as it did in Lampf or whatever the name ­­

16

was it Plaut?

I don't think it was Plaut.

17

MR. LAMKEN:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

Plaut wrote it.
I ­­ I wrote it.

I just

don't remember.

20

(Laughter.)

21

Do you know how many cases I've written?

22

(Laughter.)

23

So long as it doesn't overturn the judgment

24

of the court, you have to be relying on the fact that it

25

cannot act individually.

Is it magic that it ­­ that

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

10
1

the individualized law that it enacts happens to affect

2

a particular case?

3

Why is that magic?

MR. LAMKEN:

I think the principle is not

4

whether it happens to affect a particular case.

5

Congress can regularly ­­ well, often the problems will

6

come to Congress's attention because of cases, and it

7

may enact a law even thinking about that case.

8

Congress can't do is limit its law so that it applies to

that case and that case only.

specified the docket number because any of those

know, pretty much the exact same thing except it would

be in two cases, or except it would be without the

docket number.

4

a little bit nonsensical those distinctions would be.

5

And your answers suggest how, you know,

MR. LAMKEN:

Let me explain why I wouldn't

be concerned and then give you the principle that would

7

govern the remaining cases.

8

I would not be concerned about the limiting

9

principle here because Congress, for 200 years, didn't

10

get near this line because States, for almost 200 years,

11

have had the exact same principles.

history, no debate, no series of cases determining

13

did ­­ did their legislatures cross the line.

And yet, there's no

14

The rule that I would give to address that

15

is, simply put, if it's not listing particular cases,

16

then Congress isn't going to cross the line so long as

Now, I'm going to start with sovereign

And that's because

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

sovereign immunity was a matter of comity, grace, and

2

international politics.

the executives' determinations because they did not want

4

to embarrass the executive or create an international

incident by assuming jurisdiction where the executives

told them not to.

And the courts would respect

Congress, certainly must have very broad power to decide

what assets shall or shall not be kept frozen and not

5

MR. LAMKEN:

So if the President were given

the power to confiscate and distribute these assets,

7

which frankly he has not, if he were given that power,

8

that would exacerbate the separation of powers problem,

9

because the executive branch and the political branches

should take accountability for seizing the assets,

authority that the Federal government invokes, which is

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, just under the straight

separation of powers argument, that would be

adjudicating if Congress said Smith wins in this case?

Or

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the court:
This Court has held since the days of the

22

Schooner Peggy that Congress may amend the law and make

23

it applicable to pending cases, and the court must give

24

effect to that law.

25

triggered the application of this law ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But usually when we say

3

that, we're talking about amending the law that has

4

effect beyond the particular pending case.

5

say, yes, absolutely, Congress can amend the law.

6

Congress knew that it would affect these pending cases.

7

No problem because Congress passed something, you know,

8

that was within the scope of its legislative powers to

9

amend law affecting this case and others.

10

And there we

When you take out the "and others," that

11

seems to create a different kind of problem, one where

12

Congress is doing our job rather than its own.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

Justice Kagan.

15

underlying that.

16

I ­­ I think not,

And there's several important principles

One, the Footnote 9 in ­­ in this Court's

17

decision in Plaut said that there ­­ that imposing

18

individual duties or liabilities on a particular person;

19

in other words, a particular law, private law, there's

20

no limitation on that in the U.S. Constitution.

21

Counsel for Petitioner has mentioned various

22

State law decisions that have said special bills are not

23

permitted.

24

distinguishes those cases and said, yes, some State

25

constitutions have that, but the Federal Constitution,

This Court's decision in Paramino

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

46
1

as a matter of separation of powers, has no limitation

2

on special laws.

3

There may be equal protection issues, bill

4

of attainder issues, or special Article I powers like

5

bankruptcy, where there ­­ where there's a Uniformity

6

Clause and you can't have a State statute affecting a

7

particular case or dispute.

8

The second point is if Congress is able to

9

legislate with respect to a specific dispute, and it's

10

done it, for example, with respect to railroad labor

11

disputes at ­­ in the Maine Central case, and this

12

Court's decision on Burlington Northern mentioned there,

13

where Congress ­­ there's a labor dispute, Congress

14

comes along and prescribes the results of that dispute.

15

That's a specific law.

16

it can't be rendered unconstitutional just because there

17

happens to be a suit pending about it.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's ­­ it's okay.

It can't ­­

Mr. Kneedler, do you ­­ do

19

you agree with what Mr. Olson said, that Congress can't

20

just pick a winner in a particular suit?

21

say Smith wins in this case ­­

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Absolutely.

Congress can't

The ­­ the

23

straightforward principle is whether Congress is

24

amending the law or whether Congress ­­

MR. KNEEDLER:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The question that I gave

4

Mr. Olson ­­ and I ­­ I'm searching here for an

5

answer ­­ is ­­ is what happens if rather than just

6

picking the winner, Congress amends the law, tweaks the

7

law, modifies the law in such a way ­­ as to only this

8

case ­­ in such a way that it's absolutely clear that

9

the effect of that will be to pick a winner?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think if Congress is

11

amending the law, it can do that.

12

example, in the Schooner Peggy, which involved an

13

international treaty in ­­ in the court of foreign

14

relations, and that's another reason why what Congress

15

did here, I think the court should owe special deference

16

to.

And let ­­ for

But in the Schooner Peggy, if there had been

18

only one ­­ that was a treaty that required each party,

19

the United States and France, to restore ships to the

But your ­­ your answer

was there's a difference between amending the law and

Alderson Court Reporting

48

2

different from what Mr. Olson was arguing.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

That seems to me

I think ­­
What ­­ what is the

5

principle that would prohibit directing the result in a

6

specific case?

A separation of powers principle?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9
10
11

Yes.
So we are ­­ so ­­ so if

we interpret this matter before us as directing a result
in a particular case, the Petitioners prevail?
MR. KNEEDLER:

If ­­ if it's directing a

12

result under preexisting law without an amendment.

13

the Court interprets the law that way, then ­­ then you

14

would be correct.

15

But Congress amended the law ­­

16

you're quite articulate.

MR. KNEEDLER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm ­­ I'm not ­­ I'm ­­
I'm not sure I follow.
Well ­­
All ­­ all of a sudden now

we find that there is a separation of powers of

principle; that you cannot direct a result in a

particular case.

making.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

55
1

MR. LAMKEN:

2

I'd like to begin by going back in history

3

to answer Justice Kennedy's question about a law that

4

says we're going to lift the statute of limitations from

5

one plaintiff and one plaintiff only and nobody else.

6

Thank you.

And the answer to that is early in the

7

nation's history, State court after State court said,

8

You cannot do that.

9

It violates separation of powers.

And the amazing part is not just that those

10

courts held, but there's no case that can be cited by

11

anyone saying that that is actually consistent with

12

separation of powers from early in the framing, much

13

less a law that goes further and effectively says that

14

not only are you going to lift the statute of

15

limitations, but we're going to change the loss.

16

this one case, plaintiff wins and defendant loses.

17

That is completely foreign to our legal

On

18

traditions.

19

for 200 years, Congress never once enacted a law like

20

that.

21

but the fact that Congress understood that that was

22

constitutionally prohibited.

23

It's completely foreign to history.

And

That reticence would be amazing if it were not

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, could it be that

24

Congress just thinks that's very unfair and that's why

25

they haven't done it?

Alderson Court Reporting

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

56
1

MR. LAMKEN:

That ­­ that is one, but it

2

could have been the same thing in Plaut, that for 200

3

years Congress thought it was unfair to get rid of a

4

final judgment and eliminate repose.

5

But the matter of the fact is that the fact

6

that is also unfair, the fact that there may be

7

individual liberty guarantees associated with it,

8

doesn't mean it's not a separation of powers problem.

9

Because separation of powers protects this Court.

10

It doesn't ­­ and it does ­­ when it does

11

so, it also has the effect of guaranteeing fairness and

12

individual liberties for individuals.

13

So separation of powers is important even if

14

one would think that the law might be unconstitutional

15

on other grounds.

16

It's this Court's authority to say what the

17

law is and to decide cases, without Congress passing a

18

law saying, for this one case and this one case only.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

You think the issue here is

the protection of the judiciary rather than providing a

21

certain element of equal treatment for the people who

MR. LAMKEN:

If the political branches give

16

that power to the President, that only exacerbates the

17

separation of powers problem with doing it this way.

18

19
