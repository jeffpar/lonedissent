ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL D. POSPISIL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. POSPISIL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The issue before the Court today is whose

12

citizenship ­­ citizenship controls for purposes of

13

diversity when a trust is a named party to a lawsuit.

14

We believe, based upon over 200 years of

15

jurisprudence from this Court, the answer is the

16

trustees.

17

in this case, that in a lawsuit involving a trust, just

18

as with a trustee, the trustee should be the party of

19

interest.

20

We believe a bright­line rule is appropriate

And we should compare it to the ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why should we get to that

21

question if, when this case began, even if you looked

22

only to the citizenship of the trustees, there was no

23

complete diversity?

24
25

MR. POSPISIL:

Your Honor, that ­­ that is

correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

However, we do argue ­­ and we argued in the

2

Tenth Circuit; it was briefed ­­ upon whether or not we

3

could dismiss the ­­ the ­­ the spoiling nondiverse

4

parties.

5

and it was briefed before the Tenth Circuit; however,

6

the Tenth Circuit did not address that issue.

That issue was briefed under Evergreen case,

7

Respondents bring it up in their brief now;

8

however, our position is that this Court should address

9

the issue that's taken, that it granted cert on, and

10
11

send that issue back to the Tenth Circuit for review.
What the Tenth Circuit held here, the issue

12

that we appealed on, was to look at the beneficiaries as

13

opposed to the trustees.

14

that that's just not supportable under common law, and

15

it provides results in an unworkable test that is going

16

to create more confusion than looking at the trustees.

17

And we would submit to you

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

19

MR. POSPISIL:

Maryland law has created a statutory

3

However, our position is that just because

4

that trust can sue and be sued as an entity, that does

5

not change the analysis.

6

we look to, some real people that we look to to

7

determine whose citizenship controls.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

There still has to be somebody

Well, this new entity is

called a trust, but why is it more like a traditional

10

trust than it is like another unincorporated, artificial

11

entity, like an L.L.C.?

12

MR. POSPISIL:

Your Honor, it's more ­­ it's

13

like a trust because there are two attributes that a

14

trust have, that have historically had.

15

separation between legal ownership, and beneficial or

16

equitable ownership.

17

There is a

We have it in this case.

If you look at Maryland law, they define

18

REIT as an unincorporated business trust in which

19

property is acquired, held, managed, administered,

20

controlled, invested, or disposed of for the benefit and

21

profit of any person who may become a shareholder.

22

distinguishes between legal ownership and equitable

23

ownership.

24
25

That

The next step we look at is that the common
law, when that's the situation, when you have a trust,

you look and see did the trustees have the customary

2

power to control, to manage, and to oversee the assets.

3

Also including to control ­­

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So who ­­ who owns ­­ who

5

owns these assets under Maryland law?

6

trustees, or is it this ­­ this new corporation­type

7

entity?

8

MR. POSPISIL:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it the

Your Honor ­­
That's the entity that can

10

sue, and I assume that that's the entity that owns the

11

property.

MR. POSPISIL:
Under Maryland law ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your ­­
­­ just ­­ just as though

you ­­ you hired a ­­ a CEO.
MR. POSPISIL:

I would disagree, Your Honor.

20

Under Maryland law, the assets of a real estate

21

investment trust can be held by the trustees, or the

22

trust in its entity.

23

Again, I don't think that makes the ­­

24

exactly what happened in Navarro.

MR. POSPISIL:

Navarro.

8
9

And that's not the case

here.

6
7

That is correct, Your Honor.

However, the trust in Navarro was a
Massachusetts trust, and it could have sued in its own
name as well.

11

And the way that Navarro was framed by the

12

lower court when they decided the opinion was the

13

district court held that, for purposes of a business

14

trust, we look to the citizenship of the beneficiaries.

15

This Court ­­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But didn't ­­ didn't ­­

17

Carden treated Navarro as a case where the suit was

18

against the individual members, the individual trustees,

19

trustees as individuals, not the trust.

20

MR. POSPISIL:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct, Your Honor.
So I thought Carden was

22

trying ­­ was set up ­­ if you're a corporation, that's

23

one thing.

3

added notion that, if Congress wants to make it

4

different, Congress can do that.

5

MR. POSPISIL:

Your Honor, we believe what

6

Carden did is Carden tells us if you're not a

7

corporation, if you're another entity but not a

8

corporation, we need to look behind the curtain, so to

9

speak, and look to somebody else to see whose

10

citizenship controls.

11

Carden did not involve a trust, didn't

12

involve ­­ did not involve trustees, and did not involve

13

trust assets or trust beneficiaries.

14

did not control in Carden, and why Carden does not

15

control in this case.

16

That's why Navarro

Carden tells us the first step we have to do

is we have to look through the trust.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, this is not a

4

traditional trust, because this is shareholders and not

5

beneficiaries.

6

MR. POSPISIL:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It ­­ it's a very

different sort of concept.

That's what's

No, Your Honor.

No.

It's

So Carden gets us halfway.

The next thing

8

we need to do is look at Navarro, and Navarro tells us

9

if it's management and customary to control these

10
11

assets, we look to the trustees.
I would tell the Court that the trustees in

12

this case are very identical to the power of the

13

trustees in the Navarro case.

14

petition for writ, and the appeal, on the page of the

15

appendix, page 60, that's the amended statement of trust

16

for Americold Realty Trust.

17

If you look at our

In Section 5.1 on page 60, it defines the

18

board of trustees and what their powers are.

19

20

affairs of the Trust shall be managed under the

21

25

Alderson Reporting Company

2

That is almost identical to the language

used to describe the trustees in Navarro.

9

Importantly,

Navarro realized that they were

And Carden realized that it was separate,

10

too.

11

real party in interest test that was adopted and used

12

for Navarro was unique because it was the common law's

13

dealings with trustees, which just didn't exist in

14

Carden.

15

In Carden, this Court specifically held that the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the

16

distinction in Carden was quite plain, that Carden was a

17

case against the individual trustees, not against the

18

trust.

19
20

Carden did say that.
MR. POSPISIL:

Carden distinguished Navarro;

that's correct, Your Honor.

21

That is correct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On the ground that the

22

suit there was against the individual trustees, not the

23

trust.

24
25

MR. POSPISIL:

That's correct.

However,

Carden did not decide that issue because, again, the

8
9

MR. POSPISIL:

Your Honor, Carden dealt with

a partnership that had members.

Again, there are no

10

members in a trust.

11

in Carden to say you have to go ­­ look at the members

12

because they're who you really look at, well, the

13

closest thing to a member of a trust is going to be the

14

trustees; it's not going to be the beneficiary.

15

So if we export the language used

Let's look back at common law.

When a

16

partnership ­­ before they could sue or be sued in their

17

own name, a partnership always had to have ­­ the

18

members of that partnership had to bring the cause of

19

action.

20

Now let's look at the common law for a trust

21

before a trust could be sued or sue in its own name.

22

those circumstances, the trustees were in charge of the

23

litigation.

24

lawsuit.

25

In

It was the trustees that brought that

So to the extent that Carden sheds any light

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

on what is a member and what is not a member for the

2

trust, we submit that the most analogous thing is that

3

the trustee is the equivalent to a member for a

4

partnership.

5

looking at all the beneficiaries, that's going to be a

6

problem that is so unworkable that in certain

7

circumstances you're not even going to be able to tell

8

who is a beneficiary.

9
10

For example, some trusts, like a charitable
trust, don't even have beneficiaries identified.

11
12

The problem with the Tenth Circuit's rule

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why should it matter as

long as it's not a corporation?

13

MR. POSPISIL:

Because, Your Honor, again,

14

we go impact to how trusts have been treated separately

15

and distinctly, as a historical matter, for hundreds of

16

years.

17

A trust has never been held to be equal to a

categories:

21

22

There's a corporation; there's an

And they are different.

But the beneficiary analysis used by the

23

Tenth Circuit, again, not only it would be hard to

24

identify who some beneficiaries are, but we have

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. DUGGAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DUGGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

2

please the Court:
We urge the Court to adopt and reaffirm its

3

bright­line ruling announced in Carden that artificial

4

entity associations sued or suing in their own names

5

must measure their diversity citizenship by all of their

6

members, which would include those persons who own a

7

beneficial interest in the entity.

8
9
10
11

In this case, that would be the shareholder
members of a REIT who are in perfect accord with the
limited partners' ownership interest in Carden.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Would you describe

12

beneficiaries as a member ­­ member of a trust?

13

as you articulate it.

14

this, and Carden sort of gets you past the trust.

15

16

going to look at the trust.

17

or the beneficiaries?

18

MR. DUGGAN:

I mean,

I think what's different than

Okay.

But

We're not

Do we look at the trustees

And I ­­ I don't know if I'd call

Mr. Chief Justice, I think it's

20

important to understand that there is a very significant

21

distinction between a shareholder of a REIT and a

22

beneficiary of a common law traditional trust.

23

As set forth in the appendix to the

24

petition, page 79, which is the Declaration of Trust for

25

Americold, the actual shareholders have personal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

property interest in the shares.

2

interest in the property of the trust entity, and they

3

have no right to compel any partition, division,

4

dividend, or distribution of the trust property.

5

They do not have any

And that makes them uniquely different than

6

a common law beneficiary who actually has an equitable

7

ownership interest in the trust property.

8
9

Under common law traditions, the trustee
holds the legal title to the asset but only for the

10

benefit of those persons who are named as beneficiaries.

11

And those beneficiaries have equitable rights in the

12

property that's legally nominally in the name of the

13

trustee.

14

Here the shareholder members, as we describe

15

them, only have an interest in the personal property of

16

a certificate of ownership, very much like the limited

17

partners in Carden.

18

In Carden the limited partners didn't have

19

an ownership interest in the assets of the entity.

20

had a certificate of ownership as a limited partner.

It

They do two things:

They invest money in an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

ownership, and they periodically vote on important

2

matters that affect the entity.

3
4

They are, in most instances, virtually
identical.

5

So in my view ­­ and I think this case rests

6

upon defining a clear rule, a clear rule that says when

7

you have an artificial entity, we're going to measure by

8

those persons that I consider to be the beneficial

9

owners.

10

And I'll tell you why that's important:

11

Because that is consonant with the rule announced by

12

this Court in Chapman, Great Southern, Bouligny, and

13

Carden.

14

Chapman v. Barney, the doctrinal wall case,

15

those persons that were deemed to be members were the

16

persons that were the stock owners of the joint stock

17

company under New York law.

18

In Great Southern, again a limited

19

partnership case, were those persons that had an

20

economic interest in the entity.

21

And the same rule applied in Carden.

22

If we are to adopt Americold's position in

23

this case and now suggest that the board of trustees

24

that do not have an economic ownership interest in the

25

entity itself controls, we're going to open the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

floodgates of uncertainty for the under ­­ for the lower

2

courts.

3

And I'll tell you why.

4

The Court has never explicitly addressed a

5

limited liability company, and they're common throughout

6

the United States.

7

their boards of managers boards of trustees.

8

certain instances under those uniform laws, both the

9

general partnership law and the LLC law, managers can

Limited liability companies can call
And in

10

hold property in trust for the entity just like the

11

trustees in this case can hold property in trust for the

12

entity.

13

At the end of the day, if we're going to now

14

say it's the board of managers that are called trustees

15

that we look to, everyone's going to analogize in the

16

circuits that haven't decided the LLC question:

17

much more like the board of managers in Americold and

18

much different than the limited partners in Carden.

19

it's going to create uncertainty.

20

I'm

Our rule, the bright­line rule, is very

21

clear.

Navarro stands for the limited proposition,

couldn't sue the trustees individually, right?

11

MR. DUGGAN:

That is correct.

In this case,

12

under Maryland law, the trustees, even if they are the

13

owners of the property in trust for the entity, still

14

have no authority under the statute to bring suit nor do

15

they have the ability to be sued.

16

The entity itself, Americold Realty Trust,

In other words, that, in fact, all of these

And those arguments fly in the

10

about why ­­ why not treat these just like a

11

corporation?

12

MR. DUGGAN:

Well, Justice Kagan, I agree,

13

and I think the Court said in Carden that our decision

14

is precedent bound and perhaps even unresponsive to

15

policy considerations, but it is indeed Congress's

16

prerogative to change the law.

17

And indeed, Congress has spoken.

Congress

18

spoke in 2005, and Congress said, we've legislated

19

against this backdrop of Chapman v. Barney, Great

20

Southern, Bouligny, Carden, and Navarro, and we reached

21

the decision ­­

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If we ­­ if we made the

23

law in the first place, why should we say, well, we made

24

it, but we're not going to fix it?

25

MR. DUGGAN:

Let Congress fix it.

Well, because I think Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

has fixed it, and Congress has recognized, specifically

2

with class action lawsuits, that they would treat

3

associations the same as corporations if they are named

4

as a party in a class action lawsuit in the 2005

5

amendments to Section 1332.

6

And they specifically said, if you are an

7

unincorporated association, we're going to look to your

8

place of incorporation and your principal place of

9

business for purposes of diversity jurisdiction in class

10

action lawsuits.

11

to every other garden variety commercial dispute like

12

the one we have here today, that that rule would apply.

13

But they did not say if ­­ with regard

And Congress is capable of speaking.

14

They've spoken post Carden in 2005.

15

clear that those doctrinal walls of Chapman v. Barney

16

should remain in play as announced by this Court but

17

with the limited exception of class action lawsuits.

18

And they've made it

So if the court took a wrong turn in Carden,

19

Congress has affirmed it only to the extent that it has

20

announced a rule that applies to associations for policy

21

reasons in class action cases.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

The problem, just from the

23

point of view of the common sense of it, is you have an

24

organization that has, A, the organization; B, the

25

trustees; and C, the shareholders.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

So applying Carden, what you would say ­­

2

and Navarro:

If you sue the trustees, you look to their

3

citizenship.

But if you sue the trust itself, you don't

4

look to the citizenship of the trust; you don't look to

5

the citizenship of the trustees.

6

look to the citizenship of the members.

7

You go beyond that and

I mean, that seems odd.

Why do you look to

8

the members or the shareholders, or the ­­ or the

9

beneficiaries where you sue the trust itself but you

10

don't in the identical situation where the law of the

11

State allows you to sue the trustees?

12

seems such a sport, such a ­­ a fluke.

13

MR. DUGGAN:

I mean, that

But it is the sport that's

14

played even with regard to limited partnerships,

15

Justice Breyer, because in the instance where in a

16

limited partnership a general partner who is managing

17

the affairs of the entity breaches a duty to a third

18

party and the entity itself also is responsible for a

19

breach of duty, a party can sue both the general partner

20

and the artificial entity.

citizenship and you measure the entity by virtue of who

7

In some instances, they may choose to sue the

But they have to

I think the other thing that's important
here is that the ­­ the argument suggested by the

10

Petitioner is that we look to the control test, a test

11

of those persons that are in control, and this Court has

12

implicitly and expressly rejected that test.

13

Specifically, the Court rejected it in Carden.

14

implicitly, if you look at the Chapman v. Barney case,

15

Barney was a plaintiff in the case, brought the suit as

16

president of the New York Stock Company, and he had the

17

absolute right under New York law to control the

18

litigation and bring the claim.

JUSTICE BREYER:

His point really is that

this is sort of like a trust but not very much.

11

indeed, the key point, to me, is that the shareholders

And

statutes, two statutory cites that I want to give to the

16

Court, and one of them I read already.

17

Code of Corporations and Associations 8­101(c), the

18

definition of REIT is as follows:

19

business trust in which property is acquired, held,

20

managed, administered, controlled, invested, or disposed

21

of for the benefit and profit of any person who may

22

become a shareholder."

23

Second provision:

There are two

25

definition of a business trust is "a REIT engaged in

business in which property is acquired, held, and

2

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then you say in the

4

section shareholders shall have no interest in the

5

property of the trust.

6

MR. POSPISIL:

Your Honor, if ­­ if

7

anything, that ­­ that distinction makes this even

8

further removed.

9

if they have no interest whatsoever, why would we ever

10
11
12

even look to them?

Why ­­ why would those shareholders,

That makes even more sense ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

I didn't

write ­­ I didn't write Section 6; your client did.

13

15

I don't know.

That's what it says, so how

are we supposed to take that?
MR. POSPISIL:

Your Honor, I ­­ I would say

17

that the statute obviously is ­­ is what controls here.

18

I mean, because we want to have a rule that's across the

19

board for all trusts.

Maryland, the statute language I just said definitely

21

creates an equitable interest in shareholders ­­ bless

23

And if you look at the statute of

There is another point that Respondents

made; I'd like to point out, is that they said there is

no case in which this Court has looked to anything other
