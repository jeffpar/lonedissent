ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We'll hear argument

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

Under Florida law, Timothy Hurst will go to

11

his death despite the fact that a judge, not a jury,

12

made the factual finding that rendered ­­ rendered him

13

eligible for death.

under Ring.

authorizes imposition of the death penalty is a finding

16

of fact by the Court of an aggravating factor, a finding

17

that the trial judge makes independently, and, quote,

18

"notwithstanding the jury's recommendation as to

19

sentence."

That violates the Sixth Amendment

In Florida, and Florida alone, what

20

Now, the State here contends that capital

21

sentencing juries make implicit findings that satisfy

22

the Sixth Amendment under Ring, which the trial judge

23

then simply ratifies.

24
25

That is wrong.

Whatever the jury's recommendation might
imply about the specified aggravating factors, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

Florida Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected the notion

2

that the jury's verdict is anything other than advisory.

3

Florida law entrusts the factual findings of aggravators

4

to the judge alone, who may do so on the basis of

5

evidence that the jury never heard, and aggravators that

6

the jury was never presented with.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is there ever a case in

8

which the jury found aggravators and recommended the

9

death sentence, and the judge reversed that finding?

10

MR. WAXMAN:

There may well be.

11

12

eligibility, not sentence selection.

the jury found about any of the specified aggravating

21

circumstances.

23

MR. WAXMAN:

We're talking here, Mr. Chief

21

Justice, about elements of the crime.

22

explained in Ring, the existence of a statutory

23

aggravating factor is an element of a death­eligible

24

crime.

25

And as this Court

And can anybody imagine a world, which would

guilt/innocence phase of any trial, a shoplifting trial,

law, and ­­ and eligible for punishment.

I'm not sure.

But I'd like

I mean,

You ­­

you ­­

MR. WAXMAN:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

­­ or a system like that.
Are you sure that ­­ that

13

if you have a crime that can be satisfied by various

14

elements, the jury has to agree upon the specific

15

element that satisfies it?

16

MR. WAXMAN:

The jury ­­ if they are

17

distinct elements, and this ­­ this implies the Schad

18

point that the State is raising:

19

consistent with a long historical tradition and a

20

finding of equal culpability, chooses to permit a

21

particular element in Schad, it was premeditation, or

22

the mental state to be satisfied either by premeditation

23

or by felony murder, that's fine.

24
25

If the State,

But that is not the Florida system.

Florida

Alderson Reporting Company

1

2

defendant is eligible for death only if the trial judge

3

finds as fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a

4

particular statutory aggravator exists.

5

And I submit, even if that were not the

6

case, extending Schad, which held that in light of a

7

hundred­and­fifty­year history of States including in

8

the mental element for first degree murder, either

9

felony murder or premeditation, that combining those two

10

elements didn't satisfy the death penalty.

11

is here.

12

None of that

This is a question of the Sixth Amendment

13

and the Eighth Amendment.

14

the jury can just decide some model of aggravation.

15

They just ­­ they don't agree on the specific element,

16

and that would violate, I think, the Sixth and Eighth

17

Amendment precedents.

18

No State ever has said that

other cases upholding the constitutionality of the death

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. WINSOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Florida's capital sentencing system was

13

which the State legislature conditions the imposition of

the death penalty.

15

What Ring

In this instance Mr. Hurst got that.

The

16

legislature has determined that the elements necessary

17

to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty is

18

the existence of a murder and one or more aggravating

19

circumstances.

20

And what the other side calls the advisory

21

sentence included within it a finding, as this Court

22

recognized in the United States v. Jones, that the jury

23

had determined there was one or more aggravating

24

circumstances.

25

And so the jury ­­

of it.

22

Then they get into the sentence selection

circumstances.

MR. WINSOR:

10

God, I'd like to know your
I'm ­­ I'm on pins and

The caveat is this ­­
I am, too, actually.

There are multiple ways that a

defendant in Florida can become eligible for death.
One is, in this case, where it's determined

11

at the sentencing phase because of the finding within

12

the jury's recommendation.

13

In other instances it can be ­­ a person can

14

become eligible before the sentencing phase either

15

because they have a prior violent felony conviction or

16

because they have a contemporaneous conviction.

17

For example, if someone murdered two people

18

and were convicted of double murder, that person at the

19

guilt phase, by virtue of that guilt jury's verdict, has

20

been found to be eligible for the death penalty.

21

And so at that stage, then in your

22

hypothetical, Justice Breyer, if that sentencing­phase

23

jury recommended life, the judge could override it

24

without violating Ring.

25

Now, I will tell you that, as a matter of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

Florida State law, the judge in that circumstance would

2

face an exacting standard; and, as a matter of fact, no

3

judge has overwritten a jury's life recommendation since

4

before Ring.

5
6

So as a matter of function, it is just not
something that happens in Florida.

7

But to answer your question, we do believe

8

it would be constitutional in the situation that I

9

described.

MR. WINSOR:

Not in this situation, Your

21

Honor, because that would result in a life

22

recommendation.

A six­six vote is tantamount to a life

23

recommendation.

And the judge could not override that

24

if he were relying on the jury sentencing finding to

25

satisfy Ring.

Alderson Reporting Company

And even if he weren't, he or she weren't,

standard.

4

that unless he ­­ he or she determined ­­ or unless the

5

since any judge actually overrode a life recommendation.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

it:

13

of an aggravated ­­ aggravating factor but ­­ and

14

would ­­ and then there are different ways that this

15

would come out ­­ the hypothetical was a hung jury ­­

factor and impose the death penalty.

Alderson Reporting Company

Could I give you another

Suppose that the ­­ the ­­

for whom is it appropriate?

MR. WINSOR:

In that

The person

And then it's up to the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I have to say that

17

answer surprises me because the death sentence there is

18

not at all a function of the jury's eligibility finding.

19

The judge has tossed out that eligibility finding and

20

substituted his own, which then leads to the death

21

sentence.

22
23
24
25

So how can we say that that's possibly
constitutional under Ring?
MR. WINSOR:

Because the point in Ring was

to make sure that no person was subject to a greater

Alderson Reporting Company

penalty than they bargained for when they did the crime

7

MR. WINSOR:

Shouldn't that be

Well, I ­­ I don't think so,

8

Your Honor, because the determination of the aggravator

9

doesn't yield a death sentence unless the judge, in his

10

or her own opinion, believes the death is appropriate.

11

That's a benefit.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I'm ­­ I'm talking ­­

I'm talking about what responsibility the jury feels.

14

If the jury knows that if ­­ if ­­ if we don't ­­ if ­­

15

if we don't find it an aggravator, it can't be found; or

16

if we do find an aggravator, it must be accepted.

17

That's a lot more responsibility than just, you know,

18

well, you know, if you find an aggravator and you ­­ you

19

weigh it and provide for the death penalty, the judge is

20

going to review it anyway.

21

MR. WINSOR:

I'm not sure that's an accurate

characterization of what goes on because it's not that

makes no difference.

MR. WINSOR:

If you had a situation ­­ and,

again, this would be limited ­­ let me make sure I'm

State is depending on the death recommendation of

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I want to clarify.

And

You

16

think a seven­to­five recommendation is finding an

element of the crime that makes you eligible for the

18

death penalty by a unanimous or functionally equivalent

19

unanimous jury?

20
21
22

MR. WINSOR:

We do, Your Honor.

And let me

say ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, then what do you

23

do with the statement in our case law that says a simple

24

majority is not a unanimous jury?

25

MR. WINSOR:

Well, we don't say that it's a

unanimous jury.

2

the ­­ the seven­to­five vote, by the way, is not

3

necessarily five votes that there was no aggravating

circumstance, because, again, it's ­­ there's two things

5

that go on in the jury room.

6

there were aggravating circumstances.

just ­­ they do ­­

Let me step back and say that ­­ that

7

point about the cocaine and the meth, the courts in

8

these situations look at what the ­­ what the

And we

10

know, as a matter of Florida State law, that the element

11

at issue here, to take someone who is not eligible for

12

the death penalty and to make him or her eligible for

13

the death penalty is the existence of one or more

14

aggravating circumstances, not ­­ not a specific one.

15

And so it is like Schad v. Arizona, where

you ­­ you can't say whether the jury agreed that there

was premeditation or whether there was felony murder.

That was ten to two.

Does ten to two

15

MR. WINSOR:

Not automatically, Your Honor.

16

But I think if you look at Apodaca, what they were

17

rejecting was the same arguments that the petitioner is

18

asking this Court to accept, which is that this long

19

history of the unanimity and the 12­person jury

20

necessarily means it's ­­ it's brought in to ­­ to our

system.

But I'll say this too, the seven to five is

23

not the same kind of jury verdict that you'd have at

a ­­ at a guilt phase because of this judicial backstop,

because of the other protections that Florida has put in

you still have the judge coming behind that jury, who ­­

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6
7

MR. WAXMAN:

10

Notwithstanding this flurry of

papers, I'm aspiring not to use the six minutes.

8
9

Thank you, counsel.

Let me first ­­ let me go right to
Justice Scalia's question, which is not a hypothetical,
although I'm happy to answer hypotheticals.

11

Your question was:

Was the jury told and

12

doesn't a jury have to be told that as to death

13

eligibility, the element of the crime of capital murder,

14

that it makes the decision?

15

The answer is:

It does have to be told

16

that.

17

absolutely was not told that.

18

It certainly can't be told the opposite, and it

It was told over and over again, consistent

19

with the statute, that its decision was purely advisory.

20

And I want to refer the Court to the Florida Supreme

21

Court's decision in State v. Steele, which is at 921 So.

22

The Florida Supreme Court in Steele said, first of all,

23

"Nothing in the statute, the standard jury instructions,

24

or the standard verdict form requires a majority of the

25

jury to agree on which aggravating circumstances exist.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

Under current law, the jury may recommend a sentence of

2

death where four jurors believe only that one aggravator

3

applies, while three others believe that only another

4

aggravator applies, because seven jurors believe that at

5

least one aggravator applies."

6

Florida goes beyond that.

It ­­ it is

7

unlawful ­­ and the Supreme Court of Florida has said ­­

8

to require ­­ to ask the jury, the sentencing jury, to

9

provide a special verdict that in any way indicates what

10
11

their, quote, input is on the sentencing factors.
Again, Steele, at page 546.

"Specific jury

12

findings on aggravators, without guidance about their

13

effect on the imposition of a sentence, could unduly

14

influence the trial judge's own determination of how to

15

sentence the defendant.

16

detailed findings about the existence and weight of

17

aggravating circumstances."

18
19
20
21

The trial court alone must make

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that a ­­ post Ring?

What's the date of that?
MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, this is post Ring.

And

the Court also held that Ring didn't apply.

22

It has no jury findings on which to rely.

23

And, in fact, the Court also explained in ­­

24

later in the decision ­­ in the same decision and also

25

in its decision in Franklin, that Florida bar ­­ quote,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57

"Florida bars a special verdict precisely because

2

requiring specific jury findings on aggravators, without

3

guidance about their effect, would harm the jury's

4

independent" ­­ "the trial court's independent

5

determination."

6

Now, counsel ­­ my ­­ my colleague on the

7

other side here says that, well, there ­­ there would

8

not be a statutory problem, but there would be a Ring

9

problem if we knew that the jury found that no

10

aggravators existed.

11

we have no earthly idea what the jury found?

12

be, as in this case, as Steele acknowledges, three for

13

one and four for the other.

14

So how can Ring be satisfied when
It could

As to the, I think, hypothetical question

15

that Justice Kagan was asking ­­ so, you know, in a

16

circumstance, how much leeway does the judge have to

17

make his own ­­ his or her own decisions on the death

18

penalty, the Florida Supreme Court has specifically

19

allowed the death penalty to be imposed and a

20

determination of death eligibility to be made based on

21

evidence that was never presented to the sentencing jury

22

and based on an aggravating factor on which the

23

sentencing jury was not applied.

24
25

And the notion that there hasn't been a
life­override since Ring is ­­ is an interesting fact,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58

but this Court, in this Court's Sposiano decision, in

2

this Court's Daubert decision, that's exactly what

3

happened:

4

I'm hearing ­­ I'm hearing independent evidence, and

5

you're getting death.

6

The jury said, we want life.

The judge said,

Now, as to the supposed concessions in this

7

case, I think I'll rely largely on our brief.

8

notion that somebody ­­ that the lawyers said this is a

9

two­aggravator case is certainly true.

But the

There were two

10

aggravators charged.

11

the trial judge found that two aggravators were

12

satisfied.

13

And maybe the jury ­­ we know that
