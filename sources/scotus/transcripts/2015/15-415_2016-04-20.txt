CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Clement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Service advisors are salespeople principally

11

engaged in the servicing of automobiles.

12

there is any realistic dispute here that service

13

advisors are, in fact, salespeople.

14

to me that service advisors, as their name suggests, are

15

principally engaged in the servicing of automobiles.

16

Thus, under the plain and literal terms,

I do not think

And it seems clear

17

of ­­ of the statutory overtime exemption, these

18

individuals are exempt because the statute exempts any

19

salesperson, mechanic, or partsman who are primarily

20

engaged in selling or servicing an automobile, a truck,

21

or a farm implement.

22

Now, my friends on the other side will

23

essentially concede that those last three statutory

24

nouns ­­ automobiles, trucks, and farm implements ­­

25

apply to every other noun­verb combination in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

statute.

2

that trucks and farm implements only go with servicing

3

and automobiles only goes with selling.

So they don't take the position, for example,

4

But they do take the position that, with

5

respect to the gerund "selling," that it goes uniquely

6

with salesmen, and therefore, even if you accept for a

7

minute that there is a class of people who exist who are

8

salesmen primarily engaged in the servicing of

9

automobiles, my friends would say they're not covered by

10

the statute.

11

Now, I would submit that the statute has

12

multiple textual indicators of breadth that suggests

13

that's not the right way to interpret the statute.

14

There are not ­­

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Clement, may I ask

16

you, what is the significance of the position you are

17

taking?

18

separate exemption for people who are working on

19

commission?

20

Does it have any real consequences, given the

MR. CLEMENT:

It ­­ it does ­­ it does have

21

real­world consequences, Justice Ginsburg, principally

22

for those service advisors who right now are not

23

compensated on a commission basis.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And what ­­ in ­­ in this

field, what percentage of service advisors are not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

5
1

commissioned rather than salaried employees?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, I don't have

3

a specific statistical breakdown, but I'm reliably

4

informed that it's a significant number.

5

that almost everybody is on a commissions basis and

6

there's a couple of outliers who are primarily salaried.

7

So it's not

I do think the ­­ the archetypical service

8

advisor is paid on a commission basis, and therefore ­­

9

what I take to be the import of your question ­­ might

10

also qualify under the 207(i) exemption that's generally

11

applicable across industries to commissioned

12

individuals.

13

But there are significant numbers of

14

individuals who are primarily compensated for salary,

15

and they like it that way.

16

the Court is aware, these Fair Labor Standard Act rules

17

are not waivable.

18

who's been paid primarily by salary and likes the

19

stability that comes with that, they've had that ­­

And of course, as I think

So if you have a service advisor

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's every employee.

What's that?
That's every employee

23

who's salaried.

24

and unless the law protected them, no employer would pay

25

overtime.

They ­­ if they want a job, it's a job,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

MR. CLEMENT:
Justice Sotomayor.

Well, I understand that,

I was ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't know how I can

4

take from the fact that service advisors accept what's

5

given to them because they have no choice, why they

6

prefer not to have overtime.

7

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't know that I was making

8

that strong claim; I was just trying to be responsive

9

that this case does have real­world implications

10
11

notwithstanding the 7(i) exemption.
JUSTICE BREYER:

So what example ­­ what ­­

12

if we're only talking about those of the ­­ the people

13

who sell service who are not on commission, what basis

14

is there for giving them an exception?

15

regular hours?

16

if they aren't paid on commission, why wouldn't they be

17

treated like secretaries or others?

18

Do they work

I take it if they work regular hours and

I mean, apparently Congress thought that the

19

mechanics themselves were special because they go out

20

into agricultural areas or something in the middle of

21

the night and fix a tractor.

22

irregular hours.

23

hours and they're not paid on commission.

24

wouldn't they be treated like a secretary or a ­­ you

25

see, you've got my question.

So ­­ so they work

But these people don't work irregular

Alderson Reporting Company

So why

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7
1

MR. CLEMENT:

I get your question.

I think

2

I would try to rephrase it slightly by saying why should

3

they be treated differently from partsmen or mechanics

4

if they're also paid on a more salaried basis?

5

they don't qualify ­­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so

Well, the answer would be

7

because the partsmen and mechanics, so Congress thought,

8

in agricultural areas, would have to go at 3:00 in the

9

morning to fix the tractor, and that's why they get

10

within this special treatment.

11

that's still true or not, I don't know.

12

they're there in the statute, and that isn't true of the

13

service salesmen.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. CLEMENT:

And ­­ and whether
But that's why

Here, Justice Breyer ­­
Now, what about that?

Yeah, no, I do want to be very

17

responsive to that because I do think whatever, you

18

know, Senator Bayh was thinking about farm implements

19

back in the day.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

I think today there's a very

22

good reason to treat the service advisors the same way

23

as the partsmen and mechanics for purposes of the

24

overtime exception.

25

is that we are talking about an exemption under the FLSA

So the first thing to focus on here

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

8
1

only to the overtime provisions.

2

this case, minimum­wage provisions are going to apply.

3

So however you decide

But here's the reason that all the people on

4

the service team, the partsmen, the mechanic and the

5

service advisors, really need this exemption.

6

most customers of auto ­­ automobile dealerships who

7

need service themselves work pretty regular hours, sort

8

of 9:00 to 5:00, Monday through Friday.

9

times at a dealership are what they call the morning

Because

So the busy

10

rush and the afternoon discharge for the day.

11

also on Saturday, over 90 percent of automobile

12

dealerships' service departments are open on Saturdays.

13

And then

So with respect to the partsmen, and with

14

respect to the mechanics, they end up working a little

15

more than 40 hours a week, because they're there a

16

little bit earlier than most people, they leave a little

17

bit later, and then they're there on Saturday.

18

Now, most of them in fact are paid at least

19

partially on commission, and the way most of this works

20

is that everybody, the partsmen, the mechanics and the

21

sales advisors, all kind of share in the commission.

22

if they bring in a certain amount of sales, they all

23

share in that.

24
25

So

So as a practical matter, it makes an awful
lot of sense to exempt all of these people from the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

9
1

overtime rules.

2

paid above the minimum wage, which is ­­ the exemption

3

doesn't apply to anyways ­­ and they all have a reason

4

to work, like, about 50, 46 hours a week instead of 40

5

hours a week.

6

all of a sudden take the service advisors, who are an

7

integral part of the team, and also happen to be the

8

best paid on average of the three, and say we're going

9

to pluck you out and you alone are not going to be

10
11

They're all paid well.

They're all

And it would be very, very disruptive to

exempt from the overtime rules.
I think that would be very disruptive.

And

12

the industry has understandably come upon these

13

arrangements during the three­plus decades when my

14

friends at the Labor Department acquiesced to this

15

arrangement because they had an interpretive regulation.

16

They went out and brought some enforcement actions, and

17

even though it was the Wage and Hour Division themselves

18

that were litigating these cases, they could not

19

convince a single Federal judge that they were right

20

about their interpretation of the statute.

21

Now, I think those Federal ­­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23
24
25

But, Mr. Clement, those

courts were before Chevron.
MR. CLEMENT:

Oh, they were, Justice

Sotomayor, but ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

10
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you know, I take less

2

value in what the courts said because every one of them

3

said the provision was ambiguous.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well ­­
They just thought that

6

the better argument ­­ this was before Chevron ­­

7

favored your interpretation.

8

sure that ­­ that it's accurate to point to those older

9

cases as supporting your position unequivocally.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

So I'm ­­ I'm not quite

So Justice Sotomayor, I think

11

it's fair to take the older cases with one grain of

12

salt, but I wouldn't take it with two or three.

13

reason is that Chevron, with all due respect, didn't

14

invent deference to agencies.

15

it's important to recognize that all those early cases,

16

those were cases that were enforcement actions brought

17

by the Wage and Hour Division.

18

cases where a private party was coming in.

19

And the

And that's why I think

And they weren't just

So I don't think the judges in that case ­­

20

those cases, when they were sitting there listening to

21

the Wage and Hour Division lawyers, didn't have some

22

deference in mind ­­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have a very practical

24

question.

Are these sales advisors specially trained in

25

some way?

Do they go to mechanic ­­ mechanic school?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

11
1

Do they ­­ how are they trained?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

I ­­ I'm ­­ so I'm going a

3

little bit out of the record here, and I haven't read

4

anything that's directly on point.

5

though, is that there are these kind of academies that

6

are put together, including by the National Automobile

7

Dealers Association.

8

that included both sales training but also some training

9

in some diagnostic.

10

that's ­­ that's ­­

11

My strong suspicion,

And they would get some training

But I'm ­­ I want to be candid that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because, to be candid

12

with you, it scares me to think that every time I take

13

my car to a dealer, that a non­mechanic is telling me

14

what's wrong with it.

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Well ­­ and I understand that,

16

but I think that's actually why these people may be

17

nonmechanics, but they're not outside the servicing

18

lane.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. CLEMENT:

Well ­­

And there are costs for ­­ you

21

know, for the dealers.

22

know, I'm more familiar with.

23

the dealership if the original diagnostic is wrong and

24

they end up ordering the wrong part.

25

stuff that they do try to minimize.

This is something that, you
There are real costs to

Alderson Reporting Company

All of that is

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

12
1

And I do think ­­ to get back to the Chevron

2

point, though ­­ it's also worth recognizing that two of

3

the cases that have rejected the Labor Department's

4

position were post­Chevron cases, both the Fourth

5

Circuit decision in Walton ­­

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But now the Labor

7

Department had a chance to rethink.

8

said that these people, these salespeople are not

9

exempt.

Originally they

And then there were these ­­ the letter, the

10

opinion letter and the handbook.

11

2011 or 2012?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then in ­­ was it

2011.
They said now we're going

14

to rethink this, and our decision is that we were right

15

the first time, that these people are not exempt.

16

that decision is made in the Chevron era when we defer

17

to the expert, and this Department of Labor is certainly

18

expert in this area.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

And

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

20

don't think what the agency did in 2011 merits Chevron

21

deference.

22

deference, but they're ­­ they're studiously vague about

23

what they'd like you to defer to.

24
25

And the Labor Department of course asked for

And if you look at what they did in 2011, I
don't think there's anything you can really defer to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

13
1

there.

2

that date back to 1970 had a specific provision, (c)(4),

3

that addressed service advisors, and it explained the

4

rationale why service advisors weren't exempt.

5

think it was particularly persuasive to any of the

6

courts, but at least there was something that addressed

7

service advisors specifically.

8
9

Because up until 2011, the interpretive rights

I don't

Now, in 2011 in the process of this
notice­and­comment rulemaking, they actually removed

10

that entirely.

11

anything that addresses the service advisors

12

specifically.

13

language in (c)(1) that addresses salesmen and says

14

salesman is somebody who sells a car, which we think is

15

an incomplete recognition of what the statute actually

16

says.

So the interpretive regs no longer have

So they're now relying only on the

17

But what I'm making is really two points.

18

don't think they're really entitled to, in 2011, take

19

something out of the regs and then all of a sudden say,

20

well, because we took them out of the regs for

21

notice­and­comment rulemaking, we now get Chevron

22

deference where previously we might not have.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I don't understand

24

that.

25

deference and notice­and­comment rulemaking.

I mean, it's kind of the case for Chevron

Alderson Reporting Company

They

I

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

14

clearly considered exactly this question.

2

judgment on it.

3

a notice­and­comments setting.

4

Chevron, what is?

5

They made a

They have effected that judgment within

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, if that's not

Well, two things, Your Honor,

6

and then I want to remind you that if this statute is

7

clear, you don't get to Chevron.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

MR. CLEMENT:

Of course.
But two things cause Chevron.

10

Here is the first, which is, I would agree with you if

11

what they did is at the end of the notice­and­comment

12

rulemaking, they came up with, say, a new definition of

13

"servicing," and that informed why they came up with the

14

decision that they did, but that's not what they did.

15

They came up with a decision that took out the provision

16

that specifically addressed service advisors, and then a

17

single paragraph of the preamble to the notice ­­ to the

18

rules, because there's nothing in the rules that really

19

addresses it anymore.

20

So the only thing you can look to is the

21

preamble.

22

the red brief.

23

sum total of their explanation.

24

read, Your Honor, because what it principally says is,

25

we're doing this because we don't think the statute

It's on pages C5 and C6 of the Appendix of
There is one paragraph there that is the
I think it's worth a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

15
1

covers it, which is not really the kind of explanation

2

that I think ought to get them something other than what

3

the statute means.

4

And then this is my second point ­­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.

Because the first one

6

is not so good.

7

all the time.

8

statute.

9

And this Court has never been in the business of saying,

The first ­­ I mean, agencies do this
They say, this is the way we read the

This is the way we want to read the statute.

10

oh, when you think that the statute says something, you

11

don't get deference.

12

is ambiguous but you give other reasons, you do get

13

deference.

14

unadministrable line to use.

15

Whereas when you think the statute

I mean, that would be a ­­ a completely

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't ­­ I don't want

16

to quibble too long with you on that.

I don't think

17

that would be unadministrable at all.

This Court has

18

recognized the exact same principal in the hour context,

19

which is to say that if all you do is parrot the

20

statute, then that doesn't really gain you any extra

21

deference, and I think all ­­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This is not parroting the

23

statute.

24

which we think is better than another way.

25

This is saying we read this statute in a way

MR. CLEMENT:

And so I want to get to my

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

16
1

second one.

2

worth reading that paragraph on C5 and C6, because

3

particularly in the unique circumstance, and this is the

4

segue to my second point, in this is a unique

5

circumstance where every Court that has looked at the

6

statute, since you first took the position that it meant

7

X, has said, no, it means not X.

8

you had a rule ­­ a notice­and­comment rulemaking,

9

which, by the way, started with the proposal to codify

10

the rule that all the courts had adopted, just because

11

in that process you say, well, we still think we have

12

the better view, I don't think that's enough to get you

13

deference.

14

mean, I do think Fox, and State Farm before it, say that

15

when an agency is changing its position, it has to

16

account for the reliance interests that have been

17

engendered.

18

about the fact that, well, for 33 years, we, the Labor

19

Department, agree that this was clear the other way ­­

20

I would just say, though, I do think it's

To then, just because

But even if you disagree with me so far, I

And you'll see nothing in that paragraph

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, I mean, the question is

21

on the reliance interests, if you think people have been

22

relying and will be punished for that reliance.

23

guess the question to you is, well, why would that be

24

so?

25

only prospectively, and there is a particular provision

And I

Because this rule applies not retroactively but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

17

in the Portal­to­Portal Act, which essentially says if

2

you relied on an old interpretation, don't worry.

3

won't be subject to any damages with respect to that

4

interpretation.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

You

So two points on that, Your

6

Honor.

7

this case was filed in September 2012.

8

and we hereby seek damages only after the May 2011

9

effective date of the regulation.

The first is, just to be clear, the complaint in
It didn't say

So in terms of what

10

we're facing with here, I mean, you'd at least have to

11

trim it back based on the Portal­to­Portal Act

12

provision.

13

But here's the reason I think even that's

14

nonresponsive to what the dynamic here is.

15

pretty unique dynamic, I'll grant you.

16

acquiescently circuit cases.

17

are in the Ninth Circuit, but I think this is even

18

clearer.

19

And it's a

With this

I mean, my ­­ my clients

Think about a dealership in the Fourth and

20

the Fifth Circuits, okay?

21

precedent that says that the service advisors are

22

exempt.

23

says, gosh, darn it, we still think we have the better

24

view, what are they supposed to do?

25

supposed to change their operations overnight and

They already have circuit

Now, if all the agency does in a rulemaking is

Alderson Reporting Company

Are they really

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

18
1

conform to this, even though they have an extant circuit

2

precedent that says they're right and the Labor

3

Department's wrong?

4

narrow circumstance, makes this different.

5

they had come in and say, boy, we are going to come up

6

with a whole new C4, and we are going to have a new

7

explanation for why these guys are exempt, then maybe

8

the auto dealers in the Fourth and Fifth Circuit would

9

think, well, this is a whole new day.

10

And that is what, at least in this
I mean, if

Maybe we better

change our practices.

11

But I would have a hard time advising a

12

client in the Fourth or Fifth Circuit that you ought to

13

change your practices, notwithstanding that Walton is

14

still on the books, notwithstanding that the Fifth

the fact that ­­ or should I read something, or why

and it decided to use only "salesmen," which under the

dictionary meant a salesperson of cars; a "partsmen,"

"mechanic," but it didn't include sales advisors.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, here's what I would say

6

that you should read into that, Justice Sotomayor, which

7

is you should read into the fact that Congress used the

8

term "any" and "any salesmen," and then modified it not

9

just by selling vehicles, but also by servicing

10

vehicles, to think that Congress didn't need to

11

separately add the service advisors in, because they

12

were already covered by the language of the statute.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I mean, I guess I would

still say, though, the question ­­ I'd make two points,

15

one I've already made, which is I do think, since they

16

used any salesman, I think they thought that they

already had it covered.

18

The second thing I would say is I think if

19

they were going to include service advisors into the

20

statute, I think what the statute would say is exactly

21

what it says now, which is it would say "any salesman,

22

service advisor, partsman, or mechanic engaged" ­­

23

"primarily engaged in" ­­ "in selling or servicing

24

automobiles," trucks, or farm implements.

25

And what I think that shows is that there's

nothing at all unnatural to say that the service

back and talk to the customer and tell them what they

4

MR. BIBAS:

I have a couple of responses.

5

The first one is if there's a line to be drawn, that of

6

course is for the agency.

7

Secondly, I would say that they are engaged

8

in the dictionary definition, repairing or maintaining

9

automobiles.

And in the reply belief, at page 11,

10

Petitioner comes very close to conceding, well, they're

11

not repairing in the way that repairing ­­ servicing is

12

used in several other statutes that we cite.

13

theory is they are part of this general process, or

14

integral on core sales and service, which they're adding

15

to the statute.

16

But our

The only way that Petitioner manages to add

17

that to the statute is saying that the phrase "engaged

18

in" somehow broadens the ordinary meaning of servicing.

19

But it doesn't, for three reasons.

20

The dictionary definitions cited by the

21

government engaged in means employed in or taking part.

22

So then Petitioner falls back and says, well, the FLSA,

23

when it uses "engaged in" means something broader.

24

cite a definition provision, 203(j) in the reply brief.

25

And they say that the definition means that "engaged in"

So we pulled the actual subsection which

Your Honor, there are about four

questions in there, if I might take them in turn.

15

You asked about your own writing and your

16

own position on reliance.

17

in Long Island Care, where first of all you took the

18

position that intermediate agency enforcement changes

19

its set of rules, and it's ­­ Smiley, the Court said the

20

same thing ­­ don't count as changes of position in the

21

first place.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'd point to your own opinion

I ­­ that's a good point,

23

and I don't know how absolute we ought to be there.

24

And ­­ and the reason this is now facing me with that

25

problem.

Of course they can't do everything for every

Alderson Reporting Company

employee in the agency, and they get all kinds of

2

informal advice.

3

It's a practical problem.

But here we have a kind of extreme,

4

30 years, manuals, noting explicitly that it's a change

5

of position.

6

agency can't always be consistent with every other part,

7

so that's exactly what you put your finger on that I ­­

8

why I asked the question.

9

I mean, it's not just one part of the

MR. BIBAS:

10

Okay.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the fact that I said it

11

that way that time at most is going to show I'm not

12

always perfectly consistent, which is ­­ I'll admit.

13

MR. BIBAS:

I think Your Honor was also

14

correct in saying in Long Island Care that the

15

notice­and­comment rulemaking process makes any ­­ the

16

potential for any unfair surprise unlikely.

17

It's also quite noteworthy in the reliance

area that, as the professor's brief pointed out, in the

answer some additional questions.

like to discuss the text of the statute as it was

7

and separated salesmen from partsmen and mechanics in

8

subsection or clause B.

9

The first is, I'd

Congress enacted the statute in 1974

Second, I'd like to discuss Petitioner's

10

argument that selling services is being primarily

11

engaged in servicing automobiles.

12

we think that's just plain wrong.

13

As a textual matter,

And, finally, I'd like to discuss really

14

what's at issue here.

15

policy arguments about high­paid commission, people who

16

are salesmen, they're incentivized to sell.

17

has essentially conceded in his argument that what we're

18

really talking is people who aren't paid on commission.

19

Those people are who Congress was concerned about,

people who fall outside of 207(i), and there's no reason

21

to expand 213(b)(1)(A) to cover them.

Petitioner has made a lot of

Petitioner

So first, when Congress enacted the statute

in 1974, and this ­­ you can see this on page 2A of the

what Congress did.

Alderson Reporting Company

47
1

Prior to 1974, there was a single exemption,

2

salesmen, partsmen and mechanics.

3

several different types of vehicles.

4

applying to trailers and aircraft, as well as

5

automobiles.

6

And that applied to
It included

In 1974, Congress decided to eliminate the

7

exemption for partsmen and mechanics for trailers and

8

aircraft.

9

this.

10
11

The legislative history is quite clear on

When they did that, they created subsection B.

So they preserved the exemption for salesmen.
But look at subsection B, this is on top of

12

page 3A, it says "Any salesman primarily engaged in

13

selling trailers, boats, or aircraft."

14

That shows you that Congress was ­­ linked

15

salesmen to selling and, by implication, partsmen and

16

mechanics to servicing.

17

the only time servicing comes in is when partsmen and

18

mechanics were there.

19
20
21

Because when you look at (A),

So I think as a textual matter, that shows
you what Congress was trying to do.
Second, "selling" is not servicing.

2

You're selling it.

Maybe you might be seen to be part of the

3

process of servicing, but it's not natural to say that

4

you're engaged in servicing.

5

And I think it's telling that Petitioner has

6

to rely on Section 203(j), as my brother suggested,

7

203(j) is a definitional section.

8

Petitioner gets to the suggestion that doing things that

9

are essential to the production is production is because

The only way

10

the statute says, "For the purposes of this chapter, it

11

shall be deemed production."

12

And as my brother explained, "Farmers

13

Reservoir," and this is a quote, "explains that

14

production in the normal sense is quite different rather

15

than production in the special sense defined here."

16

What we're talking about is the normal sense

17

of being engaged in servicing.

18

actually taking part in the repairing or the providing

19

maintenance for automobiles.

20

that.

21

That means you are

Service advisors do not do

Moreover, Petitioner's reading, if we really

22

do expand servicing to extend to people who are engaged

23

in the process, why wouldn't you cover salesmen who only

24

sell warranties, salesmen who only sell the antirust

25

coating under the car, salesmen at the counter that sell

3

5

That's wrong.

6

They're all engaged in selling

This promotes the sale of automobiles.

The mechanic that simply fixes the HVAC

9

Petitioner's view, is essentially engaged in selling or

Everybody at a dealership, under

10

servicing because they're engaged in the process of

11

selling or servicing automobiles.

12

That's just wrong.

Line drawing is necessary.

Now, we depart a

13

little bit from Respondents in that we think the statute

14

is ambiguous, right?

15

said, salesmen engaged in selling or servicing, you'd be

16

forced to say, well, Congress must have meant "salesmen"

17

instead of ­­ intended a distributive meaning when they

18

included "salesmen and partsmen and mechanics."

19

line drawing that has to be done here ­­ if you

20

acknowledge that line drawing has to be done, salesmen,

21

the service advisors are way down the line.

22

I mean, if the statute had just

But the

They rely on partsmen, but partsmen, as we

23

explained, are working hand­in­hand with mechanics.

24

they're logically understood to be servicing, but a

25

salesman is not logically understood to be servicing.

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

50
1

So what's key about the canon of Reddendo

2

and the recognition of distributive phrasing is not that

3

you have to read the statute that way, but what it does

4

suggest is that there is no such basic rule of grammar

5

that requires the use of "or" to link every antecedent

noun with all antecedent gerunds.

whether it's ambiguous.

Now, that's ­­ maybe this

10

problem in my mind will go away, but I ­­ I'm with you

11

up to a large point.

12

there is no longer any reason at all for having the

13

mechanics exempt, but they're there.

14

the service people, an agency could reason, well, let's

15

not make a bad situation worse, which is what you say.

16

Or they could reason the opposite:

17

identical, why not treat them the same.

I think it is ambiguous.

18

Now, problem.

MR. YANG:

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think

And so then, with

These are virtually

And so the real question is

don't they have to address this?

And it isn't just ­­ he's quite right, your

colleague, where he says this isn't just a simple

reversal of a regulation.

16

And there's some protection in the

MR. YANG:

Address it.

Think about

I think what's necessary is for

17

the agency to recognize that it had a prior position,

which it did here.

20

understood the statute to be most appropriately read.

you're suggesting that the agency has to explain why its

MR. YANG:

I think you can ­­ you can ­­ if

But if it were, you could easily see the answer by

reading the ­­ the 1978 opinion letter in conjunction ­­

12

Thank you.

The 1978 opinion letter was based on the

theory that service advisors are selling, they're doing

you're working on service under warranty.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

55
1

Just a few points in rebuttal, starting

2

right where Justice Breyer and my friend from the SG's

3

office left off.

4

you look at what they did in the preamble, they did what

5

agencies do every day, which is first they say, we have

6

some comments that say this; we have some comments that

7

say that.

8

Then there's the money paragraph that explains what they

9

actually did, what justifies their decision, and there's

Which is to say, I think, you know, if

They simply relate what the comments were.

10

nothing in there about reliance interests at all.

11

there's anything to your Fox position, then I think this

12

does not get a passing grade; it gets a flunking grade.

13

So if

And what I'd like to just offer as a

14

potential comparison:

15

also revisited the issue you addressed in Long Island

16

Care, and they did that through notice­and­comment

17

rulemaking.

18

night looks like and what day looks like, because that

19

is all about the reliance interests of the fact that

20

they treated this one way for many, many years, and

21

there are sections of that preamble explaining when they

22

change it how this is going to impose costs and why

23

those costs are justified.

24

stark example of how the agency should behave when

25

they're changing the position.

As you may know, the agency has

And it's worth a quick look to show what

It's ­­ it's ­­ it is a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

56
1

And here's the last thing to add about this:

2

It also ­­ if they give that kind of analysis, it gives

3

some reason for people, especially in the Fourth and the

4

Fifth Circuit, who already have a binding circuit

5

precedent that say that service advisors are not ­­ are

6

exempt, it gives them a reason to maybe think about

7

changing.

8
9

But when they do nothing to address the
reliance interests and they just say, gosh, we really

10

think we were right all along, why is anybody,

11

especially in the Fourth and Fifth Circuit, supposed to

12

change the way they're doing things, and that's the only

13

way that they say that they can even possibly get within

14

the protection against massive, retroactive damage

15

liability.

16

So I think, in a sense, the State Farm

17

principles or the Fox principles would work hand­in­hand

18

with this concern about retroactivity.

19
20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
send it back?

21
22

So is it okay if we just

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

As long as it means

that there is no retroactive liability.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

there's not.

25

any.

I mean, I ­­

They've already conceded

So they're ­­ they're not going to claim

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. CLEMENT:

No, no.

What ­­ no, no.

What

2

they won't concede ­­ we're not talking about

3

retroactive liability.

4

predates when they clearly explained why they changed

5

their position, which would be sometime in late 2016 as

6

opposed to in 2011.

7

make a big difference.

8
9
10

I'm talking about liability that

So ­­ so in that sense, it does

Just a couple of other textual points,
because I do think you actually don't even need to get
to any kind of deference issue.

11

My friend on the other side ­­ I think we

12

have a better reading of 203(j), if you want to look at

13

it, because Congress specifically ­­ it's a definition

14

session.

Everything in there is what they deem things

15

to mean.

And then they deem "production" to mean one

16

thing, and then they mean "engaged in production" to

17

mean something broader.

18

But in all events, my friends concede that

19

"engaged in" means taking part.

20

advisors take part in servicing, just like the partsmen

21

take part in servicing.

Well, the service

22

Mr. Chief Justice, if you have any questions

23

about what the service advisors do, a good place to look

24

is the complaint.

25

they evaluate the service and/or repair needs of the

JA40, they tell you what they are ­­

3

the servicing process.

4

integral to the servicing process than what the partsmen

5

do.

6

That, to me, seems to be taking part in
I'm not so sure that's not more

The last point I'd like to make here is that

7

there is a practical anomaly that will be created with

8

siding with the other side, is that the best­paid people

9

in the servicing departments will now be the only ones

10

that are not exempt.

11

On average, the service advisors make about

12

$66,000 and ­­ a year.

13

$51,000 a year.

14

year.

The average partsman makes

The average mechanic makes $59,000 a

15

Now, I'd hate to be the person that has to

16

go explain to the partsmen and the mechanics why it is

17

that their better­paid service advisor colleagues are

18

the only ones that aren't exempt from the FLSA overtime

19

provisions and are going to get a windfall in litigation

20

like this.

21

That would be ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because they would be

22

exempt to the extent they paid on commission which, as I

23

understand it, most of them ­­

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

But to

repeat my answer to you, there are people right now who

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

59
1

are service advisors who are not paid principally on a

2

commission, and they like it that way.

3

consequences of ruling in the other side's favor is that

4

automobile dealerships are going to have to go to these

5

people because FLSA provisions are not waivable.

6

they're going to have to say, look, I know you like it

7

this way, but we've got the Supreme Court decision.

8

have to rejigger things.

And the

You get into this different

10

the way you've been paid for the 30­plus years the way

11

the Labor Department has been acquiescing in this, save

12

the Ninth Circuit below, and find that service advisors

13

are salesmen principally involved in servicing

14

automobiles.
