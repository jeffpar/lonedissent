ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT H. STRAUSS

9

ON BEHALF OF THE NO. 14­614 PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. STRAUSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

Maryland determined that new generation was

13

needed for local reliability, so it directed its retail

14

utilities to sign 20­year contracts with a competitively

15

selected project developer.

16
17

Maryland's action did not intrude on Federal
authority, primarily for two reasons.

18

The first reason is that Maryland's new

19

resource did not distort the wholesale capacity auction.

20

FERC revised its auction bidding rules to require the

21

Maryland resource to bid on the basis of its cost,

22

backing out any State contract revenue.

23

bid in accordance with the rules and cleared the

24

auction.

25

The developer

FERC says that means that the resource is

Alderson Reporting Company

economic, needed, competitive, and does not suppress

2

prices, any State revenue notwithstanding.

3

The second reason is ­­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Well, if it doesn't

suppress prices, why did Maryland do it?

6

MR. STRAUSS:

Maryland did it, Your Honor,

7

because they saw a need for generation going forward.

8

As is clear in the generation order, Maryland perceived

9

a problem.

It had large coal units that it believed

10

were going to retire in the coming years, and it needed

11

to have resources in place to be able to meet that need.

12

So it undertook to have those resources built pursuant

13

to the contract mechanism before you.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

happened, prices would have been higher.

16

suppress prices.

17

MR. STRAUSS:

But if that hadn't
So it was to

No, it was not to suppress

18

prices, and, frankly, Your Honor, could not have

19

suppressed prices.

20

FERC revised the rules in 2011 to be clear

21

that the resource had to bid on the basis of its costs

22

without regard to the State revenue.

23

way for it to suppress prices.

24

too high for the resource, it would never have cleared.

25

It wouldn't have been in the market at all.

So there was no

If the costs had been

Alderson Reporting Company

It was only

Official

6
1

in the market because it was able to clear on the basis

2

of its cost, which showed it was efficient.

3

And FERC made that finding.

FERC found it

4

needed, competitive, and not suppressive of prices

5

notwithstanding the subsidy.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why was this done

7

through stepping on FERC's turf at all?

8

it have been done by requiring long­term contracts with

9

the new generator?

10

MR. STRAUSS:

I mean, could

It was done through long­term

11

contracts, Your Honor, but the question of getting

12

involved with FERC's turf is as follows:

13

FERC has ­­ has set up the capacity auction

14

in PJM, and when under that auction, PJM procures three

15

years in advance for a one­year period all the capacity

16

the region needs, and then it allocates the cost of that

17

capacity among all the utilities.

18

utilities that you have a way to hedge against those

19

costs.

20

you bought or procured through contract, you can bid

21

them in, and if they clear, they will offset the cost.

22

But it tells the

If you have long­term resources, resources that

Maryland's concern was this:

It wanted and

23

needed the resource, but it was concerned that the

24

resource clear so that it hedge against the cost and

25

customers not pay twice for the same resource.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

So in order to do that, it entered into the

2

contract for differences.

3

it did a competitive procurement and found a developer

4

who was willing to undertake the risk of nonclearance.

5

And the way it did that was

And that was the issue.

The contract for

6

differences assigns and allocates that risk to the

7

developer, not the State, and that enabled the resource

8

to go forward in a way that would not result in any

9

possibility of a double charge.

10

The contract developer ­­ the developer

11

receives the contract price.

12

contract price and no more than that, received the

13

market price.

14

worked if we had simply done it as a bilateral, with one

15

key difference.

nonclearance is with the developer, not the ­­

MR. STRAUSS:

long­term contracts outside the auction were prohibited.

Long­term contracts are a staple of this industry, as

you pick a price is by letting an auction determine that

This case, however, was a procurement to

It

looked at the costs it would take to build a power plant

Of course, it then

8

divided the price over the 20 years.

10

That's exactly what we bid.

We understood that for Maryland to pay for

18

Maryland's effort to dictate what CPV

those sales to PJM that are different from and far more

stable than the prevailing price on the PJM auction.

6

And ­­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

The ­­ the way that

8

they've described it to me ­­ I'll try this once more.

9

Because truer words were never spoke, than I am not

10

quite on top of how this thing works.

11

But the ­­ the ­­ the way he described is,

12

what are they bidding into the PJM is their real cost.

13

And when they are bidding their real cost, Maryland

14

isn't going to pay them a dime.

15

inframarginal unit, which I assume they would be, the

16

cost for PJM is going to be higher, not lower.

there will be extra money.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I ­­
­­ which is understanding

this.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I guess I can see your

7

problem, which is, I think, first, there's a factual

8

premise there ­­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes.

­­ which is ­­ I think it's

11

pretty much conceded that, at least in the first couple

12

of years of this, the expectation is that CPV is going

13

to be receiving an additional payment, a forced payment,

14

from the LSC, the loading serving entity, to PJM.

15

that's just a factual premise for you.

16
17

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

But are they bidding their

true cost into PJM?

18
19

So

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, they sure didn't start

that way.
And let me start here.

I mean, they had, as

21

I think Justice Alito alluded to, a completely different

22

incentive in bidding their costs into PJM than would a

23

private generator with new capacity.

24

A private generator with new capacity is

25

going to build its actual ­­ bid in its actual costs

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

because they don't want to clear at the expense of

2

having an unprofitable generator.

3

It's a completely different dynamic for

4

somebody like CPV, because the bidding clear requirement

5

for them is just an obstacle to get to the pot of gold

6

at the end of the rainbow, which is all these guaranteed

7

payments for 20 years.

8

understate their cost.

9

So they have every incentive to

That incentive was realized here.

They

10

talked about bidding in their costs.

11

bid in their costs, they bid in their costs at less than

12

$14 a megawatt­day.

13

When they first

Okay?

Now, when PJM took a look at that, they

14

ended up upping the figure sevenfold to about $96.

15

that's a great measure of their incentive to distort

16

their costs for FERC.

17

So

Now, what they will say is, ah, but

18

Mr. Clement, the $96 bid cleared, and that's all that

19

matters.

20

Well, with all due respect, that's wrong.

saying that the bid that ­­ that ­­ that FERC says that

they have to make is not their actual costs ­­

19

MR. CLEMENT:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

What ­­
­­ because if in fact it's

21

based on a cost of capital that is lower than what the

22

cost of capital really is, that is a misstatement of

23

their cost or a ­­ an ­­ a lower­than­actual cost, just

24

as much as if the steel were in fact less expensive than

what they actually have to pay.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

And of course,

another component of cost is going to be future fuel

costs.

4

that we can all have a lot of variance as to what we

5

think are going to be future fuel costs, but if I could

6

return to the capital cost and just finish this point,

7

it's even worse that it's misstated, because ultimately,

because they are getting a 20­year guarantee and no one

else is, everybody else is calculating their cost of a

12

is settling, it destroys the ability to do an

know for certain here is that this project ended up

displacing a project that actually could be built based

16

on the three­year forward price and without a 20­year

it might be a harder case, but particularly if the

subsidy was conditioned on a bid­and­clear requirement,

I would be here making a preemption argument.

Alderson Reporting Company

text of the Federal Power Act, it seems to me to make

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How do you define the

field that's preempted?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think the field that

is preempted is the ability of a government actor to set

10

wholesale rates for wholesale sales.

11

State action that sets rates for wholesale sales ­­ and

12

"rates" in this context is defined by the statute as

13

including what a seller receives for wholesale sales ­­

14

we think that's preempted.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so if you have

Are they ­­ are they

setting rates by having ended the auction?
MR. CLEMENT:

We certainly think so, and

18

more importantly, I think, for purposes of this case, so

19

did the district court.

20

to hear my friends on the other side, as I heard them in

21

the colloquy with Justice Kagan, they essentially

22

conceded they lose if Maryland sets the rates, and that

23

concede it's a mixed question of fact and law and all,

2

but still there it is.

The district court ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In a sense, I guess all of

4

the bidders in the conventional auction in effect set

5

their rates by their bid.

7

MR. CLEMENT:

And I think what

Justice Kagan alluded to is if Maryland ­­

8
9

Sure.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So why is this ­­ why is

this different?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it's ­­ it's not,

11

because I ­­ I think the point is, if Maryland is not

12

setting the rates here, than FERC's not setting any

13

wholesale rates, and that's not right.

14

because you use an auction mechanism to set the rate,

15

that doesn't mean that it's not the State setting the

16

rate.

17

beyond that because, based on particular findings, based

18

on the testimony of the chairman of the Maryland PSC,

19

the district court said that actually because there was

20

back and forth between Maryland and CPV, this was

21

Maryland setting the rate.

22

And so just

And if you look at footnote 48, it's ­­ it goes

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is Maryland

23

setting the rates when it subsidizes the construction of

24

a power plant?

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, if ­­ Mr. Chief Justice,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

suppose they decided to ­­ I mean, potentially they

2

could.

3

had a subsidy that was measured, a dollar­for­dollar

4

subsidy based on sales to PJM, I would think that would

5

actually be setting the rate.

6

with me, but I would say that in that case, you would

7

have a very similar situation.

8

that much clearer because these payments from the LSC is

9

directly conditioned on selling to PJM.

10
11

Not all subsidies are created equal.

Again, you might disagree

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think this case is

Mr. Clement, can you

And I'll ask you why.

Okay.
As I look at the

relevant statutory provisions, what it says is that FERC

I'm not sure how this is field preemption.

think it might be conflict preemption.

Maryland's plan conflicts with the system that FERC has

set in place, how do I articulate the rule in this case?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sure.
Because as I understand

4

it, and I don't think you ­­ you've told me any

5

differently, that the people who are auctioning in the

6

market can and do enter into contracts with States on a

7

regular basis.

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:
the States.

Oh, not with contracts with

10

side were saying.

11

contracts off of the market.

They enter into voluntary bilateral

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. CLEMENT:

And that is not what's

happened here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. CLEMENT:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

All right.

Voluntary

contracts outside the market.

17

19

Exactly.

Right.
Why is this involuntary?

Because of the State ­­
MR. CLEMENT:

Because the State told the

21

load­serving entities that they had to make these

22

payments to CPV.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

24

what conflicts?

25

preemption rule in some simplified way.

So is that

I'm ­­ I'm trying to articulate the

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm a little

Official

39
1

bit like Justice Breyer on this.

2

everything is working, but I don't think it can be field

3

preemption, because you have to explain what field we're

4

talking about and what rule we're setting in the future.

5

I think it's conflict preemption.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm not quite sure how

I think it's both, Your Honor.

7

I think part of the reason this is difficult is because

8

it's like an overdetermined equation.

9

field preemption here, but there's also conflict

There is both

preemption, and there are multiple evidences of conflict

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

sir, when I write this opinion ­­

15

MR. CLEMENT:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

So give me a simple ­­

the first paragraph.

18

Sure ­­ right.
­­ give me ­­ give me

This conflicts with what?

MR. CLEMENT:

This conflicts with FERC's

19

determination that the PJM rates for the PJM auctions

20

are just and reasonable.

21

premise here is the statute gives FERC the authority to

22

determine whether wholesale rates are just and

23

reasonable.

24

respect to the PJM markets by its regulations of PJM.

25

FERC has said that the auction clearing rate for sales

As you said, the starting

FERC has done that effectively ex ante with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

to PJM is just and reasonable.

2

Now, the authority of FERC extends not just

3

to what the nominal rate is in the auction but to what

4

the supplier receives in connection with that sale.

5

if a State, through State action, says, it's all very

6

well CPV that you've sold that to PJM and PJM has given

7

you a hundred, this is your lucky day, we're going to

8

give you another 50, that is clearly preempted because a

9

State is having the supplier receive something in

10

connection with a wholesale sale to PJM that is

11

different from the rate that FERC has determined is

12

reasonable.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

So

Let me try that with the

14

example.

15

needed.

16

So FERC is trying to get an extra thousand.

17

whom it will choose to give it and will allow to bid are

18

those who are the new people who have the lowest cost.

19

All of those people in a rising market will have higher

20

costs than the existing people.

21

Five thousand new megawatts of capacity is
Existing suppliers can't supply more than four.
The people

So if in fact FERC looks to the existing

22

people and says, which can bid?

23

use your real costs.

24

what you just said is going to have no effect on the

25

market, because they will be in the market whether they

And says, you have to

And if they really implement that,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

are given a subsidy or whether they are not given a

2

subsidy.

3

And indeed, it won't affect the price

4

because the price is affected only by the marginal

5

units, who, by definition, have higher costs than

6

anything that FERC will look to to see what these

7

people's costs are.

8

and they add to that.

9

Therefore, it is without impact,

We would like to make this argument to FERC

10

where they have to focus on it and not just say in

11

general to the SG, this is how we think, because by the

12

time we're finished, we'll be able to modify present

13

rules so that they will see that they are not hurt at

14

all in the actual world by our costs.

15

I did get something like that out of what

16

they said.

17

they'll just agree because they think I'm agreeing with

18

them at the moment, but I would like to know some

19

response to that.

20

Maybe I'm wrong in what they think.

MR. CLEMENT:

Maybe

Here's your response, Justice

21

Breyer, and it comes in two parts, because there's at

22

least two parts to that question.

23

First, I take issue with the premise because

24

it may be that some new generation will come in, in your

25

hypothetical, but it won't necessarily be this one.

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

42
1

in fact here we know, as a matter of fact, that it

2

wouldn't be this one, except for the 20­year guarantee,

3

and so they displaced somebody.

shoulders ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not shrugging my

shoulders.
MR. CLEMENT:

That is a huge difference,

13

because this ­­ the message this all sends to my clients

14

is don't take FERC's direction that you should be

15

competing based on market forces and efficiency.

16

should stop competing efficiently on the PJM and try to

17

put the best bid together based on the three­year

18

advanced auction.

19

subsidies, and we should start competing for guarantees.

20

The second part of your question, what about

We

We should start competing for

FERC primary jurisdiction.

coming from my friends on the other side because, as

23

Justice Alito alluded to, when this all started, their

24

position was this has nothing to do with FERC at all.

25

This is a financial arrangement that FERC can't even

look at.

2

Then my friend talks about how, well, they

3

eventually got market­based rate authority from FERC in

4

a submission.

5

what they said on Joint Appendix page 142 of that

6

submission.

7

said, quote, "CPV Maryland also notes that it included

8

the CFD in this application solely for informational

9

purposes and is not requesting that the Commission

Well, I ­­ I'd ask you to take a look at

What they said about the contract is they

10

address or discuss Commission jurisdiction over the CFD

11

in its decision on CPV's Maryland's request for

12

market­based rate."

13

Don't look what's behind that curtain,

14

Mr. FERC.

15

We're just here to try to get market­based rate

16

authority.

17

We don't want you to do anything with that.

For them now to come in, not having raised

18

any objection to the Supremacy Clause cause of action ­­

19

and by the way, there was a Commerce Clause cause of

20

action there as well, which is maybe why the parties

21

overlooked it, and I do think that's not jurisdictional,

22

so I think we're past that.

23

So for them to come in now and say, oh, this

24

has to go to FERC, I'm sorry; it's a bit rich.

25

understood why they were making the MOPR argument at the

Alderson Reporting Company

And I

Official

44
1

early stages of this litigation before FERC filed the

2

brief.

3

stage of the game, after FERC has filed three briefs

4

saying that the MOPR is not sufficient to eliminate

5

price­suppressive bids, that they're still saying we win

6

because FERC's on our side.

7

But I am a little mystified why, at this late

I mean, that is a bit mystifying.

And I

8

think FERC is absolutely right on this for the reasons

9

that we've already talked about.

I mean, you can't

10

really even apply the MOPR in an apples­to­apples way if

11

you have this kind of 20­year guarantee, because the

12

cost of capitals are completely out of whack.

13

course, they do have the problem that their own

14

testimony is they wouldn't be on the market at all if

15

they didn't have this 20­year guarantee.

16

And of

So in the first capacity auction that we had

17

to deal with, the price was suppressed.

18

auction since then, the price was suppressed.

19

that's why I think FERC ­­ you know, they never tried to

20

design the MOPR as this perfect thing.

21

In every energy
And

You talked about the 90 percent and the 70

22

percent?

23

client said, FERC, why isn't it a hundred percent?

24

you think about the economics of this, it should be a

25

hundred percent.

Way back in one of those proceedings, my
If

counts, this isn't perfect, we don't pretend it's

2

perfect so we think 90 perfect is a rough compromise.

3

Fair enough.

4

it doesn't mean that this is something that the MOPR is

5

some perfect solution.

6

Probably not arbitrary and capricious, but

I also don't think there's anything terribly

7

anomalous about the procedural posture of this case.

8

think it's exact procedural posture you had in front of

you in the Schneidewind case.

11

What I think makes this a preemption case,

12

and what completely distinguishes voluntary bilateral

13

contracts, is State action.

14

forcing the LSCs to make these payments, and essentially

15

conditioning CPV's participation on the PJM market on

16

the bid­and­clear requirement.

that's preempted.

It's the State action

agreement.

21

it's a market­based rate, somebody can object.

22

only time you really get State action at that point is

23

at the very end of the process when the State's doing

24

retail rate regulation, and that's the point where

6

But here you got the State action right

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement, it ­­ it does

7

seem to me important what the kind of State action is.

8

And this goes back to the question that the Chief

9

Justice raised with you.

10

If the State had just said we need another

11

power plant and had delivered a load of money to CPV and

12

said go build a power plant, you're not saying that that

13

would be preempted, are you?

14

it ­­ you know, that's going to have an effect on the

15

kind of bids that CPV is going to make.

16

is not itself changing the outcomes of the auction

17

process.

18

If it's not at all, it ­­

But the State

You wouldn't say that's preempted, would you?
MR. CLEMENT:

It would depend.

I mean, the

19

way you just described it, I would say ­­ especially

20

because I think it's a helpful answer ­­ of course not,

21

not preempted.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. CLEMENT:

But if they conditioned all of

24

that money on a bid­and­clear requirement, I would be

25

saying that that was preempted.

I think it's a harder

case, but I'd hate to lose that case here because there

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

10
11

MS. O'CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

12

In the government's view, the Maryland

13

Generation Order is preempted because by requiring the

14

State­selected generator to bid into and clear the PJM

15

capacity auction in order to receive the guaranteed

16

payments provided in the contract, the Maryland program

17

directly intrudes on the Federal auction, and it also

18

interferes with the free market mechanism that FERC has

19

approved for setting capacity prices in that auction.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have a

position on the question that Mr. Clement avoided, about

22

what if the State ­­ what if the State subsidized the

If the State ­­ if the State

just paid to build a power plant, that's not directly

6

targeting what's happening in the PJM auction.

it's adding supply to the market.

State is staying within its sphere under the Federal

9

Power Act, that's fine.

10

Sure,

But as long as the

But I also agree with the second part of his

11

answer, which is that if there was some kind of a

12

bid­and­clear requirement in the auction attached to it;

13

for example, if the State paid to build the power plant

14

and turned it over to CPV, but then they said, okay, we

15

want to get some money back for this power plant that we

16

built, so you're going to bid the capacity of this plant

and it would ­­ it would be a broader ruling.

say that when the State does something that alters the

what happened here.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why do you even need

the sort of change­in­incentives language?

the field preemption argument more that this ­­ this ­­

13

this scheme essentially takes the rate that the auction

14

produces and changes that rate for CPV and for all the

15

utilities in Maryland?

16

MS. O'CONNELL:

Why isn't

I think ­­ Justice Kagan,

17

the ­­ the reason why we don't agree with that broader

18

interpretation is because we ­­ FERC does not think that

19

just receiving extra money in ­­ in connection with

20

capacity that's being sold into the auction is

21

necessarily preempted, and let me explain why.

22

There's something that happens in this

industry, a widespread practice called contracts for

differences.

7

difference here between voluntary agreements ­­ you

9

that this is Maryland coming in and effectively forcing

10

the LSCs to enter into such a contract, and by doing so,

changing the wholesale rate.

thinks is a fair price for a new generator to bid in at.

5

The MOPR isn't a complete solution because, as we've

6

described in our brief, if somebody bids in at the

7

minimum­offer price rule but its costs are actually

8

higher, it is necessarily going to knock somebody out of

9

the auction that would have cleared otherwise, and the

10
11

price of the auction will go down.
But ­­ and I ­­ I think, as Mr. Clement

12

correctly pointed out, the MOPR is not a ­­ a perfect

13

solution to this.

14

think the incentives of what ­­ what were ­­ was

15

happening under the State program is demonstrated by the

16

fact that CPV tried to bid in so low even when it tried

17

to cost­justify their bids.

18

PJM, when trying to actually reconstruct CPV's costs,

19

came to different numbers on what those costs would be.
