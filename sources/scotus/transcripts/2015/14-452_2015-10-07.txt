14

and presented in mitigation.

17

for mitigation, and the individual assessment of each

18

Respondent's moral culpability.

Each of these jurors was able to give

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The verdicts reflect the

Do you agree ­­ do you

20

agree, whatever the Eighth Amendment does not require,

21

that it would be better practice for the trial judge to

22

tell the jury what the burden is on mitigators, just to

23

ward off any possibility of confusion?

24
25

MR. SCHMIDT:

And, in fact, Justice

Ginsburg, that now happens in Kansas.

Alderson Reporting Company

Subsequent to

this case, the State made a decision to alter its

2

pattern instructions, but that'd not required by the

3

Eighth Amendment.

In fact, the Kansas ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why can't we presume

5

it's required by the State law, not the Constitution?

6

mean, as I'm reading the decision below, the court is

7

saying that the principles of the Eighth Amendment give

8

voice to or support for the use of this burden and

9

Kansas is commanding it.

10

MR. SCHMIDT:

I

Well, I think not, Your Honor.

11

This decision ­­ these decisions were plainly based on

12

the Kansas Supreme Court's interpretation not of State

13

law, but of the Eighth Amendment.

14

point out a couple of reasons I believe that conclusion

15

is inescapable.

16

And I ­­ I would

First, the court's conclusion, which is

17

indicated at page 103 in our application, the summary of

18

what it did, the court indicated very plainly that it

19

was talking about mitigating evidence as required by the

20

Eighth Amendment with no reference to State law or State

21

practice whatsoever.

22

Second, this argument has been presented

23

previously when Kansas has been before this Court.

24

Court rejected a similar argument in Kansas v. Marsh; it

25

rejected a similar argument in Kansas v. Cheever two

embraced the similar argument made at the cert stage in

these cases.

19

interpretation of the Eighth Amendment.

20

I can only say that this decision ­­ these

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that can't be.

21

Already we know and the Kansas court knew the dissent

22

pointed out that a burden for mitigating circumstances

23

of a preponderance of the evidence is okay, so they

24

can't believe that no burden is required by the

25

Constitution.

They know that there is no requirement

Alderson Reporting Company

because the cases mentioned by you and Justice Scalia

So it has to be their view of State law.

error, and that's why we're in front of this Court.

majority opinion on this subject in the Gleason case,

Amendment; in the dissent slightly fewer pages in total,

17

but 18 references to the Eighth Amendment.

Kansas Supreme Court rejected the notion that the

subject matter at issue here wasn't required by the

21

Eighth Amendment, instead, wrote both recommended

22

statements from the prior case, the one at issue.

JUSTICE BREYER:

There would be a need if

Alderson Reporting Company

Kansas law, as is now revealed by their pattern

instructions, suggests that you do have to give the

instruction that's required, that the ­­ that the

My thinking is the

following, so you'll understand why I ask this question.

14

It, I think, could be the case that you're right, that

15

this Court has never held that the Eighth Amendment

16

requires giving such an instruction.

17

Next question:

Should it now hold it?

18

Well, the answer to that question could be this is not a

19

good case to decide that.

21

the future rule as to the 9 people who are involved in

your conclusion on that point, Justice Breyer.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it true, General

that Kansans, unlike our Justice Breyer, do not think

that ­­ that would reverse these convictions.

21

I'm just speculating, of course.

22

MR. SCHMIDT:

Justice Scalia, all I can say

23

is that in these cases, it's certainly apparent to us,

24

and I think to any fair reading, that the Kansas court

25

relied on the Federal Eighth Amendment in making these

decisions, and absent correction of those occurred by

Whether the

Constitution requires it or not, it has said the better

13

practice is to give this instruction.

19

say, yes, we have that, but the only burden of proof in

any of the instructions was in aggravating circumstances

And it pointed to the fact that aggravating

23

and mitigating were mentioned in the same clause 5 or 6

24

times with no explanation of what the burden was for

25

mitigating.

The Kansas Court thought that the jurors

proof was needed.

ambiguous or confusing, which I think is what's

12

happening there.

13

The Kansas Court said it was applying Boyde,

14

but then it went on to conduct no actual Boyde analysis

15

other than what Your Honor points to, which is simply

16

the State said repeatedly, in both cases, that there is

17

a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the

18

State must prove with respect to aggravators, and also

19

with respect to the weighing factor.

20

And the mere silence on the other side

21

somehow led the Kansas Court to conclude that Boyde was

22

violated because jurors would have inferred what was

23

imposed on the State must also have been imposed on the

24

Respondent.

indicate that jurors are often confused, generally,

MR. SCHMIDT:

this Court has adopted and applied repeatedly since

It is such common sense

But putting that aside, the Kansas Court,

can exist.

Why isn't that enough for us?
MR. SCHMIDT:

Your Honor, I would point you

16

back again to the concluding paragraph, because I think

17

it illustrates my response that ­­ there's suggestion of

18

the response throughout the record, but it illustrates

19

it well.

20

Again, back on page 103 of the Gleason

21

appendix, this is what our court said:

22

court's instruction on mitigating circumstances failed

23

to affirmatively inform the jury that mitigating

24

circumstances need not be proven beyond a reasonable

doubt."

"And the penalty phrase" ­­

2

"phase instructions as a whole exacerbated the error

3

because they referred only to the State's burden of

5

always be true because it's constitutionally required

6

that the jurors be informed the State, the government

7

bears that burden beyond a reasonable doubt.

9

The Kansas Court then concluded in the next
sentence ­­ I won't read it because I've cited it before

10

­­ but under these circumstances, in other words, when

11

there is an instruction that the State must prove beyond

12

a reasonable doubt and there is silence on the other

13

side, we conclude there is a reasonable likelihood that

14

­­ the Boyde is violated ­­ I'm summarizing, of

In other words, it is back to that per se

5

6

to these jurors the heavy burden borne by the State.

7

We did repeatedly tell them, at multiple

I would just say that it is ­­ perhaps

places, the State bears a burden to prove aggravation

9

beyond a reasonable doubt and to prove on the weighing

factor, and that the death penalty should be imposed.

11

The phrasing's in there; it's a normative phrase.

13

It's

And because we told them that repeatedly to

make clear how heavy the State's burden was, that now

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

likelihood of unconstitutional juror confusion, if the

12

jurors thought they couldn't consider something, you

13

look at the context of the entire trial.

14

And if you look at the overall instructions

15

that were given in the Carr case, you'll also see that

16

the Carr prosecutors ­­ and I'd refer the Court to pages

17

392 and 393 of the Joint Appendix, as well as 442 and

25

And then went on at the secondary cite I

2

death verdict, and I quote, "Because you have looked and

6

Anything that would reduce

I offer those as examples,

7

Justice Sotomayor, to make the point that it is, of

8

course, always possible, particularly when dealing with

9

the transcription of oral statements made during trial,

10

to find a phrase here or there that, in hindsight,

11

perhaps was inartfully crafted.

12

But the overall thrust of these

instructions, the arguments of counsel, the nature of

everything.

It didn't think that that analysis was

What I'm saying is that the lower court correctly

what it was doing, but then wholly misapplied Boyde and,

10

instead, conjured this per se rule.

11

Their misapplication of this Court's

conclusion that the Eighth Amendment requires this sort

of per se instruction.

If ­­ if the

hypo was interest­free loans should be given to those

found to have good credit, found to have good credit,

12

which mirrors these instructions, and then the language

13

that people would read that instruction and say that

They'd apply the same standard.

not even Kansas is defending the rule that these jury

instructions left the jury with the impression of.

mean, indeed, I'm not aware of a single State that does

7

so.

8

this is going to impose any sort of harm to them.

is the most modest fix in the world.

There's no amici on the State's side saying that
This

It could be done

10

not just with an affirmative instruction, it could be

11

done by just striking out the words "found to exist" out

12

of the jury instructions.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you think

14

the jury ­­ if you ­­ are they supposed to consider

15

things they didn't find to exist?

16

MR. KATYAL:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, no.
I think it's a bit

18

of a stretch to say found to exist implies a particular

19

standard of proof.

20

MR. KATYAL:

I don't think so at all, Your

21

Honor.

22

way of reading it.

23

at Instruction No. 1.

24

­­ this is at Petition Appendix page 500 of the Reginald

25

Carr petition.

I think found to exist, that's the most natural
And if there's any doubt, just look
The first thing the jury was told

"The laws of Kansas provide a separate

Alderson Reporting Company

sentencing proceeding shall be conducted when a

2

defendant has been found guilty of capital murder."

3

That's what they're told after hearing

4

months of testimony about whether or not the Carrs

5

committed the crime under what standard?

6

beyond­a­reasonable­doubt standard.

7

The

That was the only thing the jury was told,

8

time and again, both at the guilt phases, the 9 times in

9

the mitigating phase of this trial.

It thinks ­­ it's

10

absolutely reasonable for a jury to have interpreted the

11

jury instructions to say that's the standard that

12

applies here.

13

And boy, if that's the standard that applied

14

in this case, that is unlike any proceeding in

15

Anglo­American jurisprudence to my knowledge.

JUSTICE ALITO:
there's no burden of proof?

25

as this Court's decision in Tennard said.

Now, of course you could have

It's

And these jury instructions did so.

4

And look, I understand that we could read

5

these facts and say these are horrific crimes, as you

6

said, Justice Alito.

But so, too, Reginald Carr had a

7

horrific upbringing.

And I think the jury was entitled,

8

and this Court's decision in Stringer says, that it is

9

­­ when ­­ when the injection of an arbitrary factor is

10

put in and two juries could reach different results on

11

the same facts, that violates the Eighth Amendment.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEREK L. SCHMIDT

19
20

You have

rebuttal time.

15

17

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHMIDT:
on the point.

Mr. Chief Justice, I'm anxious

Thank you.

Two or three points as time allows,
Mr. Chief Justice.
First on Mr. Katyal's point that the issue
here is the how and not the what.

Alderson Reporting Company

I would come back to

Official

57
1

the point that there was both a catch­all and a mercy

2

instruction here.

3

to what this Court has suggested in the past.

And I would further point this Court

4

This Court has fairly consistently suggested

5

that the cure to a Lockett type of error, that there was

6

something presented that might not have been able to be

7

given effect, would be catch­all or mercy types of

8

instructions.

9

And I would refer you to pages 310 and 11 of

10

Penry 1 where it wasn't the Court, but it was defense

11

who requested a mercy instruction that was not granted.

12

And as a result, the case wound up in front of this

13

Court.

14

But also suggest that you look at page 803

15

on Penry 2 where this Court suggested ­­

16

Justice O'Connor writing ­­ that a catch­all instruction

17

well­crafted would have been the cure for the error this

18

Court found in Penry 2.

19

A similar implication at page 242 in

20

Abdul­Kabir, and a similar implication in page 308 of

21

Blystone.

22

what the Court has repeatedly suggested ­­

23

So I think Kansas has done here precisely

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

25

rely on?

What is the ­­ I know it's

What's the catch­all instruction you

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. SCHMIDT:

The catch­all instruction is

2

the last paragraph of Instruction No. 7.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

MR. SCHMIDT:

5

instruction is earlier.

6

paragraph in Gleason.

7

Of 7.

Yes.

Of 7.

Correct.

Thank you.
And the mercy

I believe it's the second

Secondly, with respect to Justice Ginsburg's

8

observation that there ­­ a juror would have noticed

9

that there's a different between the use of finding with

10

respect to unanimity, or finding in another context,

11

suggesting that this argument's not very persuasive,

12

that the mere use of the word "find" repeatedly somehow

13

created confusion, I think that's correct.

14

there's other contrast in this record that shows it.

15

For example, with respect to the verdict

And I think

16

forms.

17

doubt language is included, finding is included with

18

respect to both aggravation and mitigation, but the

19

jurors were asked to check the box on what aggravators

20

they had found.

21

that with respect to mitigators.

22

In those cases where the beyond a reasonable

They weren't asked to do anything like

Now, a lay juror, being asked to do one task

23

for one purpose and a different task for a different

24

purpose, is not likely to conclude that the two tasks

25

are in some way equivalent.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

Likewise, to the point that was suggested

2

earlier, Mr. Katyal correctly points out that the mercy

3

instruction is described as a mitigating circumstance.

4

That's absolutely true, but it certainly doesn't follow

5

that the jury would have thought that they have to apply

6

some burden of proof to mercy.

7

That's the entire point of mercy.

8

suggests that it wasn't reasonable to conclude that

9

reading these words "find" time and again somehow led

It's an act of grace.
And that further

10

them to an equivocal ­­ an equivalent understanding of

11

how they ought to be used.

12

Third, with respect to the Kleypas decision,

13

I am well on it, but this is back to the point that was

14

referenced by Mr. Green on the Kansas Supreme Court's

15

referencing of Kansas case law.

16

this Court to what this Court itself said in rejecting

17

precisely the same argument in the Marsh case ­­ it's at

18

page 169 ­­ where the Court ultimately concluded Kleypas

19

itself ­­ State law case that they draw upon ­­ Kleypas

20

itself rested on Federal law.

MR. SCHMIDT:

No.

But the point, Your

11

Honor, is that when the Kansas Supreme Court talked

12

about Harman, this Court only three years previously had

13

laid down the rule that governs this case.

14

It is now well developed what the Eighth

15

Amendment rule is.

16

what this Court has been asked to decide.

17

Harman doesn't say anything about

And finally, I would urge the Court to end,

18

I suppose, where we began, which is there's Eighth

19

Amendment error here.

20

Eighth Amendment error by this Court, it will be the

21

Eighth Amendment interpretation given by the Kansas

22

Supreme Court that disposes of this case, disposes of

23

the other similarly situated cases in Kansas ­­

25

And absent correction of that

JUSTICE BREYER:

to consider it.

Is that satisfactory to you?

MR. SCHMIDT:

No, Justice Breyer.

14

may arise subsequently.
