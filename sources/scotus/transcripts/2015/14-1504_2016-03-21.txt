ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9
10

MR. CARVIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The sum total of the alleged Shaw violation

12

here is that the legislature treated black­majority

13

District 3 the same way as it treated the 10

14

majority­white districts.

15

respect to all of those districts, they preserved the

16

cores of the districts, and whatever minor injustice ­­

17

It's undisputed that with

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that ­­ is that

18

undisputed?

19

shifted something like 180,000 people around?

20

How did they preserve the core when they

MR. CARVIN:

Right.

Your Honor, 83 percent

21

of the prior occupants of District 3 were in the core.

22

The plaintiff's alternative only had 69,000.

23

anybody who spent a minute doing redistricting knows

24

that simply because they're 63,000 short, that doesn't

25

mean you're going to move anywhere near 63,000.

Alderson Reporting Company

If ­­

If I

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

may explain:

For example, District 11 in Virginia was

2

64,000 short.

They moved 480,000 people to fill that

3

up.

District 2.

The district directly adjacent to District 3 was

7

MR. CARVIN:

Yes.

Was there any holding

Obviously, they said that

8

core preservation was the most important interpretation.

9

The district court found that incumbency protection and

10

politics were inarguably motivating the district.

11

way they were protecting incumbents was through core

12

preservation.

13

found that race subordinated incumbency protection or

14

politics, or that it was in any way inconsistent ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Politics motivates the

4

change in district.

5

what we seek to do, to preserve incumbency or whatever.

That is our objective.

6

MR. CARVIN:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That is

Right.
May we then use race to

8

move people from one district to another, simply because

9

that's the easiest way to do it?

We know that this is a

10

­­ a race that votes strongly for a particular party, so

11

we can use race for this ultimate neutral purpose?

12

MR. CARVIN:

You can't use race as a proxy,

13

Justice Kennedy, and it's very important to note that

14

they didn't find ­­

MR. CARVIN:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

The ­­ the district ­­ I

No.
So perhaps you can correct

me.
MR. CARVIN:

It's the difference between

21

Cromartie II and using race as a proxy.

22

tells the Federal judiciary you can't use politics as a

23

proxy for race.

Cromartie II

24

Here, when it's conceded by the plaintiffs

25

that everything we did made perfect sense if everybody

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

in District 3 was white, we know that they wouldn't have

2

led to a dramatic exodus of Democratic voters into the

3

four adjacent districts, all of which had Republican

4

incumbents, if all of those people were white.

5

therefore, since they were pursuing exactly the same

6

incumbency protection and political motivation with

7

respect to District 3, they are not somehow disabled

8

from doing that simply because the predominantly

9

Democratic voters happen to be black.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. CARVIN:

And

How did you ­­

That is why Cromartie II

12

insisted that plaintiffs show, meet the demanded burden

13

of showing, that's ­­ race ­­ traditional districting

14

principles were subordinated to race rather than

15

politics.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

the motive of the legislature was?

18

10 percent of the legislators say this is because of

19

race ­­ that's their motive ­­ 10 percent say it's

20

because of partisanship, and 80 percent say nothing at

21

all.

22

How do you show what
Let's say you have

What ­­ what is the motive of that legislature?
MR. CARVIN:

Right.

I think it's very

23

difficult to discern motive in a multimember legislative

24

body, which is why this Court has always looked, for

25

example, in Cromartie II, what are the effects?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7
1

If, for example, there was a way of

2

achieving the political objectives without respect to

3

the racial composition of the enacted district, then it

4

should be simple as pie for plaintiffs to come in with

5

an alternative that doesn't rely on race that achieves

6

their legitimate political objectives, and yet

7

plaintiffs in the district court here have proved that

8

any realteration of District 3 which results in a

9

diminution of the black voting­age population would be

10

absolutely contrary to the normal political agenda that

11

would be motivating the legislature if everybody

12

involved was white.

13

The plaintiff's alternative only reduced the

14

BVAP by 3 percent to 50 percent, and yet that converted

15

District 2 with a brand­new Republican incumbent from a

16

toss­up district to what plaintiffs themselves

17

characterize as a heavily Democratic district.

Worse still, the avowed purpose of splitting them in

legislature did.

11
12

And what happens when you do that?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would you spend a few

minutes on whether this case is moot or not?

13

districts of the representatives who are parties to this

15

action have not been changed in any meaningful way.

assert that you have a legally recognized interest in

MR. CARVIN:

Not having a State entity, in

override the sovereign prerogatives of the State, and

create an electoral system which substantially

with Justice Kagan.

9

Here is the point:

Why would, of all the

harms in American society, harms to re­election not be

legally cognizable?

12

out, the point of standing is to keep the Federal

13

judiciary in its proper role ­­ limited role in

democracy.

15

the State's sovereign's view of redistricting, that

16

would be the situation where we would want to find the

injury most cognizable because that's where the Court

18

exercises extraordinary caution and extraordinary

abilities.

JUSTICE ALITO:

There are two questions.

There's the question injury­in­fact, which you've been

talking about.

23

Now, on the issue of legally cognizable

interest, does a member of Congress who wants to be

3

MR. CARVIN:

Yes, he certainly does, because

4

obviously the interference ­­ and you have to accept as

5

true for standing purposes ­­ the improper interference

6

in the Federal judiciary into that political thicket,

7

which harms him and rearranges the entire district, is

8

obviously injury­in­fact, and is just the kind of

9

interest that this Court would want to find cognizable,

10

because, after all, it's most concerned about the

11

Federal judiciary hijacking the political process much

12

more than in any other ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Here ­­ here is the basic

problem.

15

normally a plaintiff is suing because somebody did

I ­­ I can't get the right analysis.

Look,

So the defendant is the person who

The person who did this to the plaintiff is

course the ­­ the difficulty comes from the fact that

the congressmen aren't the people who did it.

these particular people aren't the ones who did it, but

24

they're still in the case.

They're not in it anymore.

So what ­­ of

In Larios, this ­­ where this Court

2

conceivable that ­­ that paired incumbents would have no

standing to the challenge the fact that a court has put

4

them in the same district?

5

Is it

Your Honor is recognizing that incumbency

6

protection is one of the neutral districting principles

7

no different than compactness or anything else, which

8

gives incumbents special factual distinctions from the

9

run­of­the­mill people.

10

In Term Limits v. Thornton, this Court held

11

it was unconstitutional to make it more difficult for

12

incumbents to be reelected because they had to engage in

13

mail­in campaigns rather than be on the ballot.

14

So we are talking about a well­recognized

15

constitutional right where incumbents do ­­ are not

16

similarly situated to average voters and do have very

different factual interests.

18

is, that the sole reason that Representative Forbes is

now facing doom in District 4 is because of this order,

I can't understand any reason why the Court would sit

unconstitutional conduct?

State's interest, for an officious intermeddler to

But we looked at the law in Meese v. Keene, and we read

4

that as standing for the proposition that where an

5

intervenor can argue injury to his election opportunity,

6

that is adequate for a standing.

7

And in this case, it's true:

Congressman

Forbes, the fact that he had to switch from CD4 to CD2

9

really does prove the injury.

And the Special Master

found that his district would go from 48 percent

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The State of Virginia has twice decided not

several occasions, and most recently in Hollingsworth,

21

that it has never upheld standing of a private party to

22

defend the constitutionality of a State statute where

23

the State itself has not chosen to do so.

24
25

This Court has said in

not the other way around.

arguments of counsel, and the fact is, this is not a

MR. ELIAS:

this case neither the Virginia State House nor the

8

Virginia State Senate, both of whom are controlled by

9

the same party as the members of Congress affected,

10

neither body nor the legislature as a whole has chosen

to intervene in this case, which is quite different

than, for example, in the Arizona case that this Court

better claim to standing again under the ­­ the Arizona

Why can a legislature ­­

don't understand it.

11

MR. ELIAS:

So, Your Honor, one thing I want

12

to clarify just from the record, it is not the case that

13

we have conceded nor is it the case that the Court

14

found, nor are the underlying facts of the case that the

16

What Mr. Janis said was quite specific.

is quite different than saying that the Virginia

to use partisan data or race as a proxy for partisan

without respect to race, and you weren't put to that

test in this case.

5

The way you check is to come up with a

MR. ELIAS:

Well, Your Honor, I ­­ I think

6

that that is true in the circumstances in a case such

7

as ­­ as Cromartie where the evidence, the direct

evidence that race predominated was quite weak.

whether it was partisanship or race ­­ is to say, okay,

confidence if you have an alternative that said, look,

5

But that's not what's at

And if I could say, Your Honor, what's at ­­

6

what's at issue here is whether a candidate has an

7

interest in a particular composition of his voters.

8

we think actually Your Honor's own opinion in Lulac is

9

quite instructive on this.

10

And

What Your Honor said in Lulac, if you'll

11

recall, is Congressman Bonilla had alleged that the

12

allegation was that the Latino voters there were no

13

longer voting for Congressman Bonilla, and that was why

14

they redistricted.

15

And what you ­­ what your opinion for the

17

which is for the candidate and not for ­­ not for the

That's not

it would have quite expansive effects.

3

to us there is a huge difference between this kind of

legislator might seek to appeal the relocation of a base

that that would radically change the number of

4

cognizable interest in relying on that legislative

judgment when some court has taken it away?

MR. GERSHENGORN:

for the same reason that this Court rejected that idea

12

think every voter in the State would have standing,

because the legislature said, you should be in this

14

district, you should have a fair opportunity to vote.

15

But that's not the direction the Court has gone.

16

Otherwise, I

And I do think that the combination of ­­

17

viewing the office as, one, that the officeholder gets

18

to choose the constituents, and the potentially broad

19

impact of that is one that should give this Court some

20

pause.

what plaintiffs' ­­ plaintiffs' counsel, Mr. Elias, was

22

saying ­­ I think, particularly in a situation where you

23

have a State statute, in this Court's observation in

24

Hollingsworth, it would be quite unusual, I think, to

25

find standing here.

And particularly ­­ again, just to pick up on

2

If I could switch over to the merits very

3

I wanted to start with the observations of

4

Justice Kennedy and Justice Kagan on the

5

could­have, would­have standard that Mr. Carvin has ­­

6

has put forth, which, as I understand it, is basically,

7

the district is okay even if based on race as long as it

8

could have been drawn on the basis of politics or would

9

have been.

We think that really flies in the face of

10

the Shaw and Miller line of cases, that what those cases

11

are about at core are two principal things:

12

can't use race as a proxy, and you can't sort voters on

13

the basis of race.

14

defense to say, well, I could have done the same thing

15

on the basis of politics.

out of the equation, then fine.

It is precisely the sorting.

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, we think

9

Cromartie is a very important case, but it actually is

10

quite the ­­ the exact opposite of the situation here.

11

We think Cromartie is the situation in which

12

the legislator ­­ there was direct and substantial

13

evidence that the legislature acted on the basis of

14

politics, and statistics were put forward that said it's

15

equally explained by race.

16

and we think it was sensible, is there's basically a

17

thumb on the scale for politics at that point, to give

18

the State legislatures their room.

19

And what this Court said,

But in a situation like this, where there is

20

direct and substantial evidence that race was at issue,

21

that same evidence that it's equally consistent with

22

politics just doesn't cut it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

to see whether race was the motive.

9

MR. GERSHENGORN:

What do you do if,

How can you say that the

So, Your Honor, I think ­­

10

it's obviously a difficult question, but I would say two

11

things on that.

12

First is, this Court's cases have been

13

fairly unanimous in looking to the ­­ to the intent of

14

the drafter.

That's what they look to, for example, in

15

Bush v. Vera.

And in Alabama, this Court had a policy,

16

and it didn't look to see whether each of the

17

legislators individually had embraced that policy.

18

was something that the Court accepted.

19

is a long line of case law going that way.

20

That

So I think there

And second, of course, it's not solely the

21

intent of the drafter here.

22

indicators, which this Court has indicated in both Shaw

23

and Miller are extremely important, things the Court

24

looks to ­­ the traditional redistricting factors, such

25

as contiguity, compactness, are counties being split ­­

There are objective

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

66

that reinforce that kind of intent.

2

things that are open, that ­­ that are ­­ are part of

3

the plan that was enacted by all of the legislature.

4

And here ­­

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

And those are

What if the drafter or other

6

members of the legislature say, race was our first

7

consideration, and by that, what we mean is that we have

8

to take race into account under the Voting Rights Act,

9

and that's what we've done?

10

Would that ­­ what would be

the ­­ what would be the result there?

11

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I don't

12

think that that necessarily results in strict scrutiny.

13

What this Court has said over and over is that the ­­

14

that race must predominate.

15

or consciousness of race, or even the intentional use of

16

race, is not sufficient.

17

The mere intentionally ­­

And we think that makes sense, because as

18

the Court has said, the redistricters are always

19

conscious of race and always aware of race, and that the

20

State legislatures need room and ­­ need room to

21

maneuver.

22

conscious of race or even that race ­­ you intentionally

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

4
5

MR. CARVIN:

I'd like to begin with Justice

Kagan's questions.

6

We've heard a constant theme that if it was

7

done because of race, a post hoc political explanation

8

doesn't justify it ­­ I fully agree with that ­­ with a

9

mixed motive case here.

That's what the district court

10

said:

11

the only reason that race was, quote, "ranked higher"

12

was because he said that it was a Federal mandate under

13

the Supremacy Clause.

14

they committed legal error.

15

Race, politics, and incumbency protection.

And

So if that's not a justification,

If you turn to 33a, why was politics and

16

incumbency subordinate?

17

quote, "goal was permissive and subordinate to the

18

mandatory criteria of compliance with the VRA."

19

they said that they implemented it by not reducing the

20

benchmark BVAP, but that had nothing to do with the rank

21

ordering of VRA over these other things.

They told you:

22

To get to your question:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because that,

Now,

If two ­­

Well, I take the point,

24

Mr. Carvin, but isn't that really exactly what we

25

confronted in Alabama, which is ­­ you know, the number

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

68
1

one priority was the VRA, but then it turned out that

2

they had misunderstood the VIA, so it turned out that

3

the number one priority was a racial quota, which had

4

nothing to do with the way the VRA is really supposed to

5

operate?

6

MR. CARVIN:

That's fine, and that goes to

7

narrow tailoring, but what we are trying to figure out

8

here is whether or not there is a prima facie case.

9

Now, assume with me that in 30 of the

10

districts in Alabama, race was completely coextensive.

11

They didn't assert politics, but with county lines.

12

Would you ever say that race predominated over something

13

or subordinated something when they are entirely

14

coextensive?

15

Let's take it out of the racial context.

16

Compactness is number two; county lines are number

17

three.

18

with county lines.

19

"compactness predominated over county lines" because the

20

same result was ordained by these two motives.

21

can search this opinion for any finding that race was

22

inconsistent with or subordinated incumbency protection

23

or politics, and you won't find it.

24
25

You draw a nice, compact district that complies
No one in their right mind would say
