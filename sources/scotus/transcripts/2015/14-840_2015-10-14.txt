ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. DONALD B. VERRILLI
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONER
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

The Federal Power Act expressly authorizes

13

FERC to regulate the process that sets wholesale rates

14

for electricity, and that is exactly what FERC's

15

wholesale demand response rules do.

16

Demand response is a resource that is bid

17

into the wholesale auction, and the wholesale market

18

operators that run those actions rely on the bids to

19

balance wholesale supply and demand, to set wholesale

20

rates, and they particularly rely on those bids in

21

periods of peak demand to avoid price spikes and to

22

avoid blackouts and brownouts.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If there were a student in

24

Economics I, it seems to me that he would conclude and

25

his professor would conclude that wholesale affects

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

retail, retail affects wholesale, they're interlinked,

2

which means you win the case, except that the statute

3

makes the distinction.

4

Can you tell us what the distinction is that marks the

5

end of the Federal power and the beginning of local

6

power?

7
8
9

We have to make a distinction.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So I ­­ I have several

answers to that, Justice Kennedy.
First, we completely agree that what ­­ any

10

action that FERC takes at the wholesale level in some

11

sense is going to affect the retail market.

12

equal, if FERC sets ­­ FERC will set a higher wholesale

13

rate, there is going to be a higher retail price.

14

that can't be a basis ­­ those kinds of effects can't be

15

a basis, for denying FERC's jurisdiction.

16

All things

But

And the case I would particularly point Your

17

Honor to is the Mississippi Power case.

18

a case in which what FERC did was conclude that a

19

utility could recover at wholesale its investment in a

20

nuclear power plant.

21

Mississippi Power was that that had the effect of

22

denying the State regulator the ability to deny that

23

utility recovery of those costs in the retail rates,

24

even though under State law they would have been

25

imprudent costs and not recoverable.

Now, there was

And what the Court held in

Alderson Reporting Company

That was a very

Official

6
1

direct effect on the exercise of State regulatory

2

jurisdiction, which you do not have here, by the way, so

3

I think a fortiori, this is certainly permissible under

4

the rationale of Mississippi Power.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

line, "very direct effect."

7

there is a distinction between affecting retail rates,

8

which, as Justice Kennedy has pointed out, always

9

happens, and using ­­ using effect upon retail rates as

I find that a pretty fuzzy
I ­­ it seems to me that

10

a means of regulating wholesale rates.

11

here is that that is what has occurred, that

12

effectively, FERC has raised the retail price during

13

peak hours because somebody who wants to purchase at

14

retail during peak hours not only pays ­­ you know, has

15

to forgo the benefit that that person would otherwise

16

get from FERC's program.

17

retail, and that is the means of achieving what FERC

18

wants to achieve.

19

And the argument

That raises the price at

Yes, FERC has the ­­ has the power to

20

regulate wholesale rates.

21

not through the fiddling around with retail rates, which

22

is what is asserted is happening here.

23

But ­­ but, the argument is,

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So ­­ I think three

24

points to be made in response to that argument, Justice

25

Scalia.

First, the ­­ the authority that's exclusively

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

reserved to States by Section 824(b) of ­­ of the

2

Federal Power Act is the authority over retail sales.

3

Every retail sale that occurs in the regime in the ­­ in

4

FERC's ­­ under FERC's wholesale demand response regime

5

is a retail sale that will occur at the rate that the

6

State regulator has set, and under the terms and

7

conditions that the State regulator has set, every

8

single sale that occurs that is true about.

9

Second, what they have said is that this

10

changes the effective rate.

11

response to that, Your Honor, is that if I go out and

12

buy a Ferrari for $100,000, everybody thinks that the

13

price of the Ferrari is $100,000.

14

the price of the Ferrari is actually $107,000 because

15

I'm foregoing the $7,000 tax credit I can get if I

16

bought an electric car.

17

$100,000.

But what I would say in

Nobody thinks that

The rate is what it is.

It's

And here, the rate is what it is.

18

And third, the point I would make, it seems

19

to me, it's a very odd argument to say that what FERC's

20

rules do here is increase the retail price.

21

rules do is drive the retail price down by driving the

22

wholesale price down by very considerable amounts in

23

peak periods.

24

in lower rates for retail consumption.

25

What FERC's

This is ­­ this is a system that results

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, yes, ultimately, but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

the question is whether that is achieved by the means of

2

directly managing retail rates.

3

not.

And you say this does

What if FERC ­­

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Those ­­
­­ had sufficient funds

6

available that it could pay people to not purchase

7

electricity during peak hours?

8

we'll give you so much per day not to use more than X

9

amount of electricity during peak hours.

10

It just said, you know,

Would that ­­

would that be within FERC's powers?

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think that would be a

12

harder case than this one because all of the conduct

13

that FERC regulates here occurs in the wholesale market.

14

All of it.

15

accepted into the wholesale market, what ­­

16

The ­­ this is about what bids can be

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It ­­ it's the difference

17

between turning over money to these retail purchasers

18

and simply depriving retail purchasers of a benefit that

19

they could otherwise obtain in the wholesale market.

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I ­­ I think this is a

21

more straightforward case, because all of the conduct

22

that FERC regulates occurs in the wholesale market, all

23

of the actors are regulated in their role in the

24

wholesale market, and FERC's purpose in this situation

25

is to achieve lower wholesale rates and to allow and to

blackouts and brownouts in their ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

on direct price regulation of the retail rate.

5

be the same point as your Ferrari hypothetical, but

6

if ­­ if FERC is basically standing outside McDonald's

7

and saying, we'll give you $5 not to go in, and the

8

price of the hamburger is $3, somebody goes up there,

9

there ­­ the price of a hamburger is actually, I think

But it's still based
It may

10

most economists would say, $8, because they give up the

11

$5, they've still got to pay the $3.

12

And your answer is, there's no impact on

13

what the States can do, because they can still say, no,

14

the price of the hamburger should be $2, or it should be

15

$4.

16

affecting the retail price.

17

The point is that ­­ that FERC is directly

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And I guess there's an

18

additional point to be made in response to that, Your

19

Honor, is that ­­ the ­­ here, of course, what FERC is

20

doing is saying, here are the rules by which the

21

wholesale market is going to operate, and if you come

22

into the wholesale market, these are the rules that will

23

apply to you.

24
25

But ultimately it remains up to the States
because FERC takes State law as it finds it here,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

whether citizens of the State can go into the wholesale

2

market.

3

FERC ­­ if States agree that they can go into the

4

wholesale market.

5

They can only go into the wholesale market if

So it's very difficult to see that ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That ­­ that's interesting.

6

If FERC has this power, how can it strip itself of this

7

power by saying, we will not do this if the States don't

8

want us to do it?

9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think FERC

10

certainly has that authority in the course of deciding

11

what's a just and reasonable practice.

12

believe that that's what the Court held in New York v.

13

FERC with respect to FERC's decision not to regulate

14

the ­­ the bundled element of transmission there because

15

it was concerned about jurisdictional overlaps.

16

there FERC didn't exercise its regulatory authority at

17

all.

18

And, in fact, I

And

And so it's a fortiori ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's quite different.

19

That's quite different from saying we're going to

20

exercise it unless you, the States, veto it.

21

know that if ­­ if FERC really has that power.

22

know how it can confer a veto upon the States.

23

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I don't
I don't

Well, it seems to me,

24

Your Honor, that that's not an argument that goes to

25

FERC's jurisdiction.

That may be an argument, although

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

no one has made it in this case, that if FERC believes

2

that this practice is ­­ that this practice is required

3

to have a just and reasonable wholesale rate, that ­­

4

that FERC can't then let States opt out.

5

But, again, that seems to me to be a merits

6

issue, not a jurisdictional issue.

7

think it's ­­ it's just incorrect under this Court's

8

holding in FERC v. ­­

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And ­­ and again, I

No, I think it's goes to

10

whether FERC really thinks that it's meddling in ­­ in

11

retail rates.

12
13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, Your Honor ­­ I know

­­

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what it goes to in

15

my mind.

16

in fact, you know, we are mucking around in an area

17

that's the State's area.

18

us to do it, we won't do it.

19

I think it's an acknowledgment by FERC that,

And if the States don't want

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I appreciate that, that

20

Your Honor dissented in New York v. FERC on a ground

21

very much like that.

22

legitimate exercise of FERC's authority to decide what

23

just and reasonable practices were, to take that

24

jurisdictional overlap into account.

25

FERC has done here.

But the Court held that that was a

And that's all

It seems to me quite clear that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

that is, under the logic of New York v. FERC,

2

permissible exercise of ­­ of FERC's authority.

3

And so in a situation, it seems to me, in

4

which what you've got is FERC taking State law as it

5

finds it, you really can't say that this is a

6

impermissible interference or a power grab or any

7

intrusion into State authority because the States

8

ultimately make the decision.

9

I ­­ in fact, I think the Federalism

10

argument is upside down here.

11

which what you have is a FERC rule that really is a

12

strong version of cooperative Federalism.

13

This is a situation in

What FERC is saying here is that this is

14

policy that we think works, we think brings about

15

billions of dollars in consumer benefits by lowering

16

wholesale rates.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it fair to say that

18

FERC is luring retail customers into the wholesale

19

market?

20
21
22

And if that ­­
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, well, my friend

has ­­ my friend has used that term, but I think ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And if that ­­ and if ­­

23

if ­­ well, if that were true, would that not be a ­­

24

a ­­ a serious problem for the government?

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It's wrong as a matter of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

history ­­ as a matter of history.

2

matter of law.

3

response was not FERC's idea.

4

the market, Justice Kennedy.

5

grew up organically out of the private actions of market

6

participants once the wholesale markets were

7

deregulated.

8

private market conduct that you would hope that

9

deregulation would bring about.

It's wrong as a

This ­­ this idea of wholesale demand
FERC didn't impose it on
This is a practice that

It's exactly the kind of innovative

And the ­­ the private

10

actors, the wholesale market operators, brought that

11

idea to FERC as early as 1999.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

One of the briefs, by the

13

way, says that you had no authority to deregulate it.

14

You know, we had a case involving the Federal

15

Communications Commission which wanted to dispense the

16

filing of tariffs on the part of everybody, I think,

17

except AT&T.

18

agency to regulate rates and required filed rates.

19

Isn't that a problem here too?

20
21

And we held that the statute requires the

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So I'm very familiar with

that case, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

completely different.

know, when ­­

Yes, I'm sure you are.
And this case is

authority to do it?

4

I mean, I like deregulated

But the ­­ the problem is, do you have the

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Sure.

I think that

5

the ­­ that bridge was crossed in New York v. FERC.

6

seems to me in New York v. FERC held that that ­­ that

7

that deregulation, that deregulatory impulse was within

8

the authority of FERC, and that there's nothing in the

9

statutory text that precludes it.

It

And I do think that's

10

a key point here, that what we're talking about here at

11

the end of the day is FERC's authority, which this ­­

12

which comes down to what the statute says.

13

And what the statute says, in Section

14

824(e), is that FERC has authority over practices that

15

affect rates in ­­ wholesale rates.

16

doubt given that all of the practices FERC is regulating

17

occur in the wholesale auction.

18

19

And there's just no

They're all embedded in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If we're ­­ if

20

we're ­­ obviously, that's true.

obvious, it seems to me, that you have to have some sort

22

of limiting principle, otherwise FERC can do whatever it

23

wants.

24

suggest to us?

25

But it's just as

So what is the limiting principle that you would

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think ­­ I think the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

limiting principle has worked quite well in D.C. Circuit

2

for years now is that the effects have to be direct.

3

And it's a limiting principle akin to the kind of

4

limiting principle ­­ common sense limiting principle

5

that the Court has used in the ERISA preemption

6

contracts with respect to relating to.

7

And with respect to direct effects, what I

8

would say is when you ­­ what you're talking about is

9

regulation of conduct that occurs in the auction itself,

10

participation in the auction, the rates that are

11

charge ­­ that are ­­ the ­­ the bids, the nature of

12

bids that can be accepted at the auction, the use of

13

those bids to balance wholesale supply and demand,

14

payment of the bidders at a rate that FERC prescribes,

15

and recoupment of that payment in the wholesale market,

16

all in the wholesale market that you've got as direct an

17

effect as you can have.

18

And we're quite comfortable with the Court

19

drawing a line that would exclude the kinds of

20

examples ­­ the hypotheticals that the D.C. Circuit came

21

up regulating steel, regulating ­­ regulating inputs

22

into electric generation.

23

authority goes anywhere near that far.

24
25

We don't think FERC's

It ­­ but when you're talking about conduct
that occurs in the wholesale auction in the wholesale

7

8

you agree not to buy power at retail during certain

9

hours, we're going to pay you.

10

The central conduct is
That occurs

So why is that a direct effect?

I ­­ that seems to me an

indirect effect, not a direct effect.

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, the ­­ what the

conduct ­­ that ­­ that's ­­ that is ­­ it is an

13

indirect effect of the conduct that FERC regulates by

14

market participants, the wholesale market operators and

16

But that's an effect.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONERS

16
17
18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Justice Kennedy, I think I'd like to start

19

with the first question you asked, which is what ­­ what

20

do we learn essentially from Economics 101.

21

I think the way that you have to think about it is in

22

terms of the actual market that operates in this

23

particular case, which is a wholesale market.

24
25

And ­­ but

It's not a market that covers the entire
United States.

It covers less than half the States.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

But it is an important market that was created in order

2

to create a basis for competition.

3

And up to this point, up prior to the demand

4

response initiative that was not adopted by FERC, but

5

was, in fact, pushed by my clients and those we

6

represent in private business, what we were trying to do

7

was to create a demand­side component to that wholesale

8

market.

9

trying to ­­ to deal exclusively with the supply side

Because trying to regulate exclusively or

10

wouldn't work, or it's not as effective as it could be,

11

or certainly wouldn't necessarily guarantee you just and

12

reasonable rates.

13

And so tariffs were filed in order to

14

provide a basis for putting in the demand side.

15

reason why this is a direct effect on the ­­ on the

16

wholesale rates is because it's an absolute one­to­one

17

relationship.

And the

18

If I put in a unit of ­­ of or reduce a unit

19

of demand, I don't need as much supply, and that affects

20

the price directly.

21

that derives from the economic principles.

And that's the direct relationship

22

And ­­ and to my mind, the entirety of ­­ of

23

the Federal Power Act, in 201, 204, 205, asks you in the

24

first instance to look at the wholesale market that

25

exists.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does it affect the retail rate?

The question is:

Did what FERC do

Excuse me.

I think moving

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't know that it would

directly affect the wholesale rate in nearly as

14

exquisite a fashion as the regulation in this case,

15

because again, you're talking about the exact same

16

transactions going on in affecting supply and demand.

17

Nothing can affect the wholesale rates that way.

18

If I make an effort to manipulate the retail

19

rates, maybe eventually it will affect the wholesale

20

rates, but it will do it in ways that are very indirect

21

as we explained in our reply brief.

But the question is what price will allow this ­­

And what the FERC said was, when we had

experience with one of the regional transmission

operations, what happened when they reduced the price?

21

The amount of the demand response dropped precipitously.

2

And as a consequence of that, based on that

3

experience, we now have enough evidence by which to say,

4

wait a second, we need to go back and raise the price in

order to bring in more of the demand response, in order

6

to ensure that there is a reasonable balance between the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

­­ that what FERC is

17

doing basically leaves the States with the pure

18

formality of setting the rate that is going to be

19

directly affected by what FERC is doing.

20

In my hypothetical, if you remember, I mean,

21

they get to say how much the hamburger costs once you

22

get in the store, but FERC can respond to it directly by

23

setting the price to encourage you not to enter the

store.

25

If I ­­ if ­­ if$5 ­­ we'll give you $5 not

that what ­­ what FERC is trying to do here is to, in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3
4

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

I don't usually start in this Court by

6

telling you who I represent, but I think I better do it

7

here, which is I represent not just EPSA, which is a

8

group of power generators, but a number of other ­­

9

other organizations.

10

So the vast majority of the people that I

11

represent are load­serving entities who are not

12

exclusively on the supply side.

13

regulated public utilities that actually could provide

14

demand response in a wholesale, meaningful level by

15

working, as they have since long before FERC got in this

16

business, to work with retail customers and their State

17

regulators to provide for reduced retail demand at peak

18

time.

19

They're actually the

So that's who I represent.
Now what I'd like to start, beyond telling

20

you who I represent, is with the notion of what FERC was

21

trying to do here, which was to reduce retail demand by

22

providing payments to retail customers on an otherwise

23

wholesale market in an effort to change the effective

24

price for retail sales.

25

Now, that sure sounds like something that

you've characterized that goal.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is true.

What you say

6

is true.

7

electricity is ipso facto a demand for a reduction of a

8

unit of wholesale electricity, and vice versa.

hardly surprising that anything they do in the wholesale

10

market that adds to demand will add to demand in retail,

11

and vice versa.

12

Every reduction in demand for a unit of retail

So it's

17

19

And to build an additional generator ­­ I

20

don't know what gas costs now, but let's imagine it's

21

$500,000, and that will be passed on in the wholesale

22

price, and then probably, though the States are free to

23

do what they want, in the retail price.

24
25

So FERC thinks I have another way of doing
this.

For only $400,000, I can be sure that on the 4th

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

of August at 4:00 p.m., the demand is not great enough

2

to spend the 500, and so we group the people who will

3

promise to fulfill their air­conditioning at other

4

times.

5

That way, the price of wholesale electricity

6

falls.

And, therefore, we satisfy all demand at a lower

7

price.

We are interested in wholesale.

8

interested in how to satisfy peak wholesale demand.

9

we have worked out a way to do it cheaper.

We are

Of course it

10

affects retail prices, so does everything we do in

11

respect to wholesale prices.

12

End of the matter.

So I accept your characterization, but I do

13

not see any law that prevents them from raising or

14

lowering wholesale price despite the fact that that

15

affects retail price.

16

And

MR. CLEMENT:

And I certainly wouldn't be

17

here suggesting that anything that happens in the

18

wholesale market that affects retail price is somehow

19

verboten to FERC.

20

regulate wholesale prices, essentially as Justice Scalia

21

suggested, through the retail market, that that crosses

22

a very important boundary in the Federal Power Act.

23

with all due respect to your question, your approach to

24

this would make perfect sense if FERC were the only

25

regulator on this scene, but ­­

But I am here to say that when you

customers will, in fact, cut demand at 4:00 p.m. on

does everything.

As I say, that affects retail price; so

MR. CLEMENT:

The difference here is that

15

the customers they're targeting are retail customers,

16

and the very fact ­­ and this is what I ­­ where I

17

really wanted to go, which is, I think the Solicitor

18

General goes a long way to conceding that this really is

19

going at retail ­­ the retail market and the retail

20

level of demand matters, and he will concede that we're

21

changing ­­ they're changing the effective price of

22

retail electricity.

23

The only ­­ the saving grace for them is,

24

ah, but we're limiting ourselves to the wholesale

market, and we're the wholesale regulator.

Alderson Reporting Company

The fact that they are regulating in this

the fact that they're on the wholesale market is not a

complete answer is to consider the following scenario,

13

which doesn't seem all that farfetched, which is to say

14

a large retail consumer of electricity, let's call it

And if that actually

We're just going to say that Wal­Mart can't

And that's the world we live in.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's the ­­ what's

10

the horror here of concurrent jurisdiction?

11

posit that this is horrible, but if, in fact, it's

12

prices, I ­­ hard to think of why States would say no,

in the context of the Federal Power Act.

Court, on numerous occasions, has said that although

22

you ­­ sometimes it's hard to divide the lines.

23

you do, generally the Federal government operates in its

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But they all ­­ each of

them affect each other.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

But here's the problem ­­

4

yeah, normally they stay away from each other and each

5

other's customers.

6

Another thing that is a complete anomaly

7

that FERC has created here that, as far as I'm aware,

8

exists nowhere else in the energy world, is you actually

9

have the Federal government and the Federal regulators

10

and the State regulators bidding against each other for

11

the same customers to reduce their same retail demand.

12

And the other side has made a very big deal

13

that none of the States raised a jurisdictional

14

objection before FERC itself.

15

of States, Ohio, Illinois, and all of the States that

16

are participants in the MISO, one of the ISOs.

17

they told FERC is, by all means, do not set the

18

compensation level at LMP, because that's too high.

19

by setting it so high, what you are going to do is

20

you're going to crowd out our own efforts at dealing

21

with demand response.

22

We want demand response.

23

as much as the market really should pay for demand

24

response.

25

retail customers the ability to get demand response paid

But there were a number

And what

And

Because we love demand response.
But we don't want to pay twice

And if you're out there offering our same

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34

2
3
4

at huge LMP levels, then we're going to be crowded out.
Now, the only response that FERC can offer
to that is, well, then just opt­out, come on, you know.
First of all, that's the third anomaly here,

5

because there's no other area of regulatory authority

6

where FERC allows States to opt­out.

7

about what they're opting out and compare it to their

8

legal theory, it doesn't work.

9

FERC all of a sudden enthusiastic about State

And if you think

I mean, since when is

10

experimentations with practices that directly affect

11

wholesale rates?

12

In every other context where they actually

13

have jurisdiction, wholesale rates, transmission, not

14

only would they not allow State opt­outs, but they would

15

say it's going to lead to discrimination in a way that

16

would be unjust and unreasonable.

17

So the opt­out option here, though, doesn't

18

work for another reason, which is it's worse for the

19

States that most want to provide for demand response.

20

Because what they're being told is, all right, you have

21

a subset of your customers who are actually interested

22

in demand response.

23

you have to tell your customers who are interested in

24

demand response is we're actually going to pass a

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you're right, then I

6

guess the FERC could not direct the grid approvals in a

7

way that would, in fact, prevent certain retail

8

customers from buying electricity at certain times.

9

guess that FERC could not, in fact, allow large

I

10

consumers of electricity to buy at wholesale, because

11

that would take the retail customers away from the

12

jurisdiction of the State.

13

I guess that FERC could not, in fact, insist

14

upon a marginal capacity being generated from natural

15

gas instead of from other things, because that will

16

affect the price of natural gas, will affect the

17

wholesale rate, thereby raising the retail rate, thereby

18

stealing customers away from, let's say, Ohio, where it

19

goes up, and forcing them to go to Texas.

I mean, I have not been surprised that I

have found no case in which FERC ever tried to do

Well, with all due respect, a

­­ because you seem to suggest

that if you can't do this, well, then FERC can't

10

essentially tell generation resources that we don't want

11

any more coal generation; we only want natural gas.

12

And, of course, they can't do that because the Federal

13

Power Act reserved the plenary authority of regeneration

14

to the States.

15

You also suggested if they can't do that,

16

then they can't allow Wal­Mart to helpfully walk into

17

the wholesale market and buy at retail.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

I was grasping your point,

19

which I hadn't grasped previously.

20

to be that the problem here is the way they are reducing

21

the demand, and therefore, the cost of wholesale

22

electricity, is by taking a ­­ groups of people and

23

preventing them from buying electricity at all at

24

certain times, which, of course, affects their buying

25

retail.

Alderson Reporting Company

And your point seems

Official

37
1

Isn't that basically your point?

And if it

2

is, I was trying to think with that argument.

3

that's why I said that you can skip the whole thing if

4

you want.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

That's ­­

Well, here ­­ here's a way

6

of ­­ of trying to harmonize that, which is I think that

7

the line that the Federal Power Act divides ­­ draws is

8

between retail sales and wholesale sales.

9

that this is impermissibly on the retail side of the

10
11

And I believe

line.
I think my friends on the other side

12

ultimately think that the difference isn't between

13

retail and wholesale but is between sales and nonsales,

14

because they appear to concede my Wal­Mart example in

15

the retail world.

16

SG's brief, I think they pretty much concede that

17

Wal­Mart cannot walk on to a wholesale market and

18

purchase gas at retail without coming into the scope of

19

the State regulators.

20

Which is to say, on page 39 of the

I think they also concede that, if the

21

government's interest here was not to suppress retail

22

demand but to increase it, they thought, you know, if we

23

could just sort of boost retail demand a little bit,

24

we'd get a whole bunch of these new green resources

25

online and it would actually make, you know, everything

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1
2

better.
So we want to increase retail demand.

So

3

here's what we're going to do:

4

either directly or through the wholesale operators ­­

5

we're going to pay a bonus to people who increase their

6

retail purchases.

7

We're going to have

That, I believe, my friends on the other

8

side say, well, no FERC couldn't do that because that

9

would affect a fully­consummated sale.

10

So their position seems to be although we

11

can pay ­­ we can't pay incentive payments to increase

12

retail demand, we can pay incentive payments to reduce

13

retail demand.

14

Two observations about that:

One is, why in

15

the world would that make sense?

16

world would ­­ would Congress have divided the authority

17

here in a way that allows the Federal government to

18

suppress retail demand but not increase retail demand?

19

I mean, why in the

The second thing that I want to say about

20

that anomaly, though, is the line between sales and

21

nonsales can't be the right line because it ­­ if it is,

22

then not only can they do what Justice Scalia suggested,

23

which is have FERC pay a direct bounty not to purchase.

24

And I was actually quite surprised by the Solicitor

25

General's answer to that.

And he ­­ and he didn't fully

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

complete the answer.

2

case, but he didn't ultimately say how that would be

3

answered.

He said that would be a harder

4

I think he has to say that, if FERC sort of

5

cut out the wholesale operators and just said, we got a

6

new appropriation, and every retail customer that

7

reduces their retail consumption gets a $200 check from

8

FERC, that has to be consistent with their position that

9

FERC can do it because it doesn't interfere with a fully

10

consummated sale.

11

But we're still ­­ if they're right, then

12

what FERC can do tomorrow is solve this problem much

more directly.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

25

So, you know, never mind.

Or ­­ or ­­

But any way you think about it, that has to

Alderson Reporting Company

be the implication of their theory that there is a

categorical difference between ­­

What they have to do is reasonable.

It's a broadly­phrased

And so really the question is:

Is what

they're doing here unreasonable?

MR. CLEMENT:

Well ­­
And ­­ and I ­­ and we're

and technical.

12

It's pretty tough

And ­­ and so that's why I ­­ I've been

13

trying to figure out just what it is about this thing

14

that, in your view, makes it unreasonable.

15

MR. CLEMENT:

And what is unreasonable is

16

that, before you get to a Chevron question, certainly

17

before you get to an arbitrary and capricious question,

18

you have to have jurisdiction for FERC to do this.

19

And the basic division of authority in

20

201(b) of the Federal Power Act is that the Federal

21

government gets sales for resales and the States get all

22

other sales.

23

And I think it's important to recognize that

24

you really have to wrestle upfront with the 201(b)

25

question because the other side loves to talk about 205

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

and 206 in the practices affecting language.

2

problem with that is that 201(b) specifically says that

3

the provisions of this subchapter, which include 205 and

4

206, shall apply to sales for wholesales and shall not

5

apply to all other sales.

6

But the

So you don't get to 205 and 206 if what is

7

being regulated front and center is a retail sale of

8

electricity.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And at some point of ­­ I

11

want you just to assume that there is jurisdiction, but

12

to discuss your point that section ­­ that Rule 745,

13

particularly, was arbitrary and capricious, I assume,

because adequate reasons or no reasons were given.

maybe there's some other point.

before your time runs out.

MR. CLEMENT:

that, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

42
1

implications of your argument is that FERC can't do

2

anything with respect to demand response; is that right?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

No, that's not right.

My

4

position is that FERC can't do anything with demand

5

response with retail customers.

6

response, true wholesale demand response, which they

7

were actually doing before they went down this route and

8

around, you know, the ­­ the two ­­ early 2000s.

9

They can do demand

And the way that wholesale demand response

10

works is the way you sort of naturally think it would

11

work, which is through a participant in the wholesale

12

market, namely through the load­serving entities who are

13

mostly my clients.

14

Because the way you can sort of do this is

15

you work cooperatively with the States and the LSEs, and

16

you encourage them, as Congress suggested in 1252(e) of

17

the ­­ of the National Policy Act or the Energy Policy

18

Act.

19

reduce their demand, and then there's just less demand

20

bid in to the auction in the first place.

21

meets demand at a much lower level.

22

You encourage them to do all sorts of things to

And so supply

Just for completeness sake, you can also

23

have wholesale participants participate in a

24

demand/response program in the forward­capacity markets,

25

where, again, it would be the LSEs.

Alderson Reporting Company

And what they would

Official

43
1

do is say, we're going to ­­ we're going to ­­ three

2

years hence, we're going to reduce our compensation ­­

3

or our ­­ our consumption by this level, and we're going

4

to do it on the local level.

5

And just to further complete that thought,

6

you know, it's ­­ it's nice to talk that FERC has been

7

doing this since 2000, but the States have been doing

8

this long before that, at least since the 1980s.

9

And there is a brief for other respondents

10

that I don't represent, the Midwest load­serving

11

entities.

12

it's worth a quick read because what they say is, look,

13

we've been doing this at the State level since 1984.

14

We're a local utility.

15

regulator.

16

retail market, we can deal with demand response in all

17

sorts of ways that FERC could never imagine.

18

do things like basically go in and get a local customer

19

to agree with us to change the way ­­ their thermostat.

20

We can go in, send somebody in, put different hardware

21

in there, and then, based on a reduction in their retail

22

rates, we can get them to agree that basically, on a hot

23

day in the summer, we get to take over your thermostat.

24

And we directly impose demand response through that.

25

And that's the kind of thing that States

And it's worth a ­­ it's a short brief, but

We work with our local

Because we have plenary authority over the

And we can

things that are going to be crowded out by this

one­size­fits­all rule with the high LMP

4

compensation recipe.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that's the kind of

And so this sort of

6

practice, though ­­ so I'll just narrow the question ­­

7

where it's retail actors who are bidding into a

8

wholesale market.

9

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

would be a regulatory gap.

12

do anything nor can the States do anything.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

I take it that there, there
In other words, FERC can't

I ­­ there is not a ­­ a

14

regulatory gap.

15

And I would answer it by reference to my Wal­Mart hypo

16

going in to buy.

17

I don't think FERC can do anything.

If Wal­Mart went in to buy ­­ so if a retail

18

customer on the buy side sort of walks into a wholesale

19

market ­­ it's not that lightning strikes and they can't

20

do it.

21

anybody can regulate it, it's the States.

22

It's that it's a retail transaction.

So there's not a regulatory gap.

So if

In theory,

23

a State could regulate the transaction even though it

24

takes place on an otherwise wholesale market.

25

I think as a practical matter ­­ I don't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

want to ­­ as a practical matter, I don't think the ISOs

2

and the RTOs want to be regulated by both FERC and the

3

States.

4

price of having a retail customer on our otherwise

5

wholesale market is we get State regulation on top of

6

Federal regulation, then we're going to bar the door to

7

the retail customer.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Maybe you can turn

to the question Justice Kennedy asked you to address.

10
11

So I think what they would do is, ah, if the

MR. CLEMENT:

I ­­ I ­­ I would be delighted

to.
If I could say one last thing about

13

jurisdiction, which is simply I ­­ I do think, though,

14

that the premise of the other side's argument is that

15

the sky will fall if you don't have this precise type of

16

retail customer on wholesale market demand response.

17

And there, I think, it's worth taking a look at the

18

Southern company's brief, because they operate in a part

19

of the country that doesn't have an RTO or an ISO.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It ­­ it is an odd result,

21

given this Energy Policy Act which made it so clear that

22

Congress liked demand response that it wanted FERC to

23

lower barriers to demand response, to then say, well,

24

FERC has no jurisdiction to do exactly what the policy

25

that Congress articulated is.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

MR. CLEMENT:

But the problem with that way

2

of looking it, Justice Kagan, with all due respect, is I

3

think it looks only at 1252(f), which is the one

4

reference to what FERC's supposed to do, and it ignores

5

1252(e) where Congress recognized that the States are

6

the primary actors here.

7

And the point I was making about the

8

Southern company brief is operating in an area without

9

ISOs, without RTOs, so without FERC, they actually have

10

a greater level of demand response than other parts of

11

the country that have the Federal rule.

12

So to bring us to the arbitrary and

13

capriciousness question, I think, Justice Kennedy, the

14

way I think about it is that we have both procedural

15

objections and substantive objections.

16

The procedural objections are essentially

17

that there are all sorts of objections to using LMP as

18

the price to provide compensation.

19

That wasn't just my clients.

That was also

20

the States that I alluded to who were worried that this

21

high level of compensation would crowd out their effort.

22

It was a particularly poignant comment from

23

the ­­ the ­­ some of the ITOs and RTOs who design

24

these ­­ run these wholesale markets.

25

And the ones that I thought were most

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

persuasive in some respects was the operators of the

2

MISO, the midwestern one, because at FERC's direction,

3

they basically spent two years trying to come up with ­­

4

get all the stakeholders in a room and come up with a

5

formulation ­­ a compensation formula that worked.

6

what they came up with was essentially LMP minus G.

7

And

And after having spent two years with all

8

the stakeholders coming up with LMP minus G, they were

9

then told by the Federal government at a late breaking

10

hour that there was a one­size­fits­all solution, and it

11

was LMP.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, wait a minute.

13

That's the classic choice that we give agencies.

14

had expert testimony, Dr. Khan, who was undisputed to be

15

a leading expert in this field, say the opposite.

MR. CLEMENT:

Surely it has.

But the reason

22

I started with the procedural way of coming at this is

23

the D.C. Circuit has lots of arbitrary and capricious

24

cases, and they are quite comfortable in saying that, in

25

circumstances like this, you didn't respond adequately

Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would you tell me which

3

one?

5

three paragraphs in the FEC's report on this that

6

directly explains why they chose a different route.

Well, there is certainly ­­
The ­­ the ­­ the court

below didn't give us one comment by the dissenter that
wasn't addressed by something said in the report.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I can give you an

12

example, Justice Sotomayor, if it will help, which is

13

that Chairman Mueller in his dissent ­­ Commissioner

14

Mueller in his dissent actually used a hypothetical that

15

is very similar to the hypothetical discussed in our

16

brief and the SG's brief about a factory and how if ­­

17

if you have full LMP, a factory will essentially reduce

18

its production at time periods where it's economically

19

inefficient for them to do so.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

recognized that, and what did they say?

Alderson Reporting Company

2

no response to that hypothetical, just as there was no

3

response in the SG's ­­

5

doesn't work, we won't use it, which I didn't find a

6

very satisfactory response.

they said?

8

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Isn't that essentially what

I'm not even sure they ­­ they

said that much, but I don't think they really grappled
with it.

11

And to whatever extent they ­­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought that the response

13

was what Justice Sotomayor, and the way ­­ I wouldn't

14

characterize it that way, but it's called the "net

15

benefits test."

16

not a one size fits all.

17

And the net benefits test means this is

And then in the order, at paragraph 17, 18,

18

page 67, they go through a bunch of methodologies, and

19

they ­­ I mean, they say, we're picking this one.

20

And the reason that they pick this one, I

21

guess, is they think it's ­­ if you try a G thing, that

22

also is a problem administratively.

23

Okay.

Now, I'll just read those.

Is there

24

anything else you're going to tell me that ­­ I'll read

25

them and see what they say, right?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

Well, I would ­­ I

2

would ­­ I would encourage you to look at the FTC

3

comments, the Joint Appendix page 281, the comments of

4

the States.

5

I mean, I would think that when you have

6

another coordinate part of the federal government come

7

in and say, you are picking the wrong compensation level

8

and it will be affirmatively inefficient and will crowd

9

out other uses for demand response, that you'd at least

10

owe them something more of an explanation than grouping

11

them in a footnote with every other commentator you got

12

and say, we're not persuaded by that.

13

There is, though, I think ­­ and I would ­­

14

actually, you know, I ­­ I didn't think I would come up

15

here talking about net benefits test, but I actually

16

would ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

writes about that in the brief, doesn't he?

MR. CLEMENT:

MR. CLEMENT:

25

I'll read ­­ Cicchetti that

Yes.

And so I think that's the

Yes.
Right?

Okay.

And ­­ and ­­ and what I would

say beyond that about the net benefits test is here's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

another way in which the ­­ the compensation formula is

2

what I would call substantively arbitrary and

3

capricious.

4

The whole formula is built on the idea that

5

there is an ­­ an equivalence between less demand and

6

more actual supply of energy.

7

get to the nitty­gritty of it, it turns out that's not

8

true, because the great thing about actual supply of

9

energy is that other wholesale ­­ real wholesale

But of course, when you

10

customers buy it, and then the market clears naturally.

11

But when you start getting a third­party in

12

there, a retail customer who really doesn't belong there

13

and start saying, we're going to pay you money, but that

14

money doesn't actually result in load that ­­ a

15

load­serving entity pays for, that creates a deficit in

16

the wholesale account.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is one way to think about

18

that is that the ­­ FERC's argument is circular.

19

says, well, the market will take care of this, but we

20

define the market.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes.

It

And yet, it's ­­ the

22

market really can't take care of it because the market's

23

designed to simply get a bunch of wholesale sellers and

24

a bunch of wholesale buyers together, and the price of

25

the sales and the price of the purchases equal each

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1
2

other out, and everybody goes home happy.
But when you invite retail customers on and

3

say, guess what, we're going to pay you not to buy, that

4

creates a market imbalance.

5

The FERC euphemistically refers to this is

6

the billing unit effect.

7

that by making adjustments to the market clearing price.

8

And then to make sure they don't go too far down, they

9

apply the net benefits test, which is not only

And then they have to solve

10

mind­bogglingly complex, but FERC itself recognizes that

11

it's imperfect.

12

The last thing I want to say, though, about

13

sort of the substantive unreasonableness about this is

14

there is a more fundamental problem here, and it's ­­ I

15

think the economist's brief on our side gets at this

16

very well, which is at the end of the day, if FERC gets

17

to do this on the wholesale markets, what is being

18

purchased is not energy, actual energy that's been

19

bought and then sold.

20

to buy electricity at a subsidized retail rate.

21

What is being sold is an option

And in any other market ­­ I mean, think of

22

a stock where I have an option to buy it at 20 and the

23

market price is 40.

24

to offer me 20, 19 for that option because I have a

25

valuable right to buy something at a below­market price.

Lots and lots of people are going

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

But nobody is going to offer me 40 for the

2

option to buy at 20 just because the market price is at

3

40.

4

the compensation rate at LMP.

But that is exactly what FERC has done by setting

5

And they made mincemeat out of poor

6

Dr. Kahn, because what Dr. Kahn really says is that the

7

market signal that the customer ought to get is LMP.

8

But the market signal they get is LMP if it accounts for

9

avoided costs.

10
11

If you take the avoided costs out of the
question, then you get LMP plus the retail costs.

12

And of course, another irony here is the

13

distortion is greatest in those markets where the States

14

have done exactly what FERC would like, which is adopt

15

retail price ­­ real time pricing, because then the

16

retail price is LMP.

17
18

And so what is the compensation rate for
demand response providers?

19

It's twice LMP.

Now, you would say, generally, well, couple

Yes.

that it's just purely procedural because I don't think

Five minutes, General.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

22

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONER

23
24
25

Thank you, counsel.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice:
Starting on the jurisdictional issue with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

text, my friend pointed to Section 824(b), which you can

2

find at 1(a) of the appendix to our brief.

3

What it says is not that FERC shall have

4

jurisdiction over sales of electricity at wholesale.

5

says the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to

6

sales of electricity at wholesale.

7

It

One of those provisions is 824(e)(a), which

8

says FERC shall have jurisdiction over practices

9

affecting wholesale rates.

10

So we're within the plain terms of the

11

statute, and there is no statutory text that plainly

12

forecloses FERC's exercise of jurisdiction.

13

friend, in 30 minutes, didn't even try to identify one.

14

So in terms of applying Chevron, there's no

And my

15

doubt that ­­ that FERC's interpretation has to be

16

upheld.

17

With respect to the Wal­Mart example that my

18

friend identifies, I think it shows why his argument

19

about hermetically­sealed­off retail and wholesale

20

spheres really has nothing to do with the real world.

21

In the real world today, large customers can

22

buy directly.

23

can also go into the wholesale market auctions and buy,

24

if their States permit it, and that does happen in the

25

real world.

They can do it through contract, and they

And this is really no different because

2

demand response entities that want to come in and

3

participate can only do so if their State law allows

4

them to do so.

5

going on in the real world for quite a long time.

6

So it's no different than what's been

Third, with respect to the load­serving

7

entities, the ­­ the utilities, my friend says, well,

8

don't worry about it; they'll do all the demand

10

It will work great.
FERC addressed that.

It addressed it

directly.

12

have sufficient incentives to engage in demand response.

13

And it's obvious why they don't, because they

14

cannibalize their own profits.

15

have, the higher their rate of return profits are going

16

to be generated.

17

State regulatory agencies to do it, but they'll do it

18

grudgingly.

19

come in who have a real profit motive to do it, and

20

that'll incent the LSEs to get in there and try to get a

21

piece of the action rather than letting it go to

22

somebody else.

It found that load­serving entities don't

The higher cost they

They will do it under commands from

But FERC addressed that issue specifically.

24

Now, the idea that demand response can't

4

going on.

5

see in this administrative proceeding some evidence that

6

it was a problem, and there is zero evidence.

7

at all these briefs; there isn't a citation to anything

8

in the administrative record that suggests that the

9

Federal and State programs can't work in harmony.

We have 24 States in which this is

Now, with respect ­­ just one point on

And

arbitrary and capricious, and I'd like to sum up.
I think if you're going to look at one thing

14

in terms of the concern you've raised, Justice Kennedy,

15

I would look at page 223 of the Appendix to the

16

petition ­­ of our petition, and what you will see right

17

there is FERC directly identifying the problem that my

18

friend spent the last few minutes of his argument on,

19

and then going on to say ­­ and then going on to explain

20

in great detail for several pages why that critique is

21

wrong, and citing in particular the paragraph of

22

Dr. Khan's declaration where Dr. Khan is responding to

23

the specific critiques that my friend made.

24
25

So it ­­ it certainly meets the threshold
test of ­­ of ­­ of an adequate explanation for a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58

decision.

2
3

Now, if I could sum up, I think this is what
this case comes down to.

4

On one side of the scale, you've got a

5

practice that saves billion ­­ that has saved billions

6

of dollars in wholesale costs and will save billions of

7

dollars, and it's an effective tool against blackouts

8

and brownouts, and that nobody has shown in the real

9

world does any harm.

10
11

You have a statutory provision that gives
FERC specific authority to regulate this practice.

12
13

You have no statutory provision precluding
it.

14

You have Chevron in case there's any doubt.

15

And you ­­ and you have, really, a strong

16

cooperative Federalism program here in which States have

17

the ­­ States are masters of their own fate.

18

whether customers in a State participate or not is up to

19

the State.

20

policy, the State can say it doesn't operate in our

21

State.

22

Whether ­­

If the State thinks this is not a good

On the other side of the scale, what you've

23

got is an argument that all those benefits have to be

24

extinguished, and ­­ and no argument in the record that

25

there was any harm from this program.

Alderson Reporting Company

You have no clear

Official

59
1

statutory text for bidding FERC from engaging in this

2

regulatory practice.

3

And my friend used the phrase "one size fits

4

all."

5

here on the other side is a faux Federalism argument.

6

Their argument is the one size fits all.

7

Well, I ­­ I suggest that really what we've got

There are lots of States out there that want

8

their consumers, want their citizens to participate in

9

this because they think it's good policy and it's

10

completely harmonious with their regulation.

11

my friend's argument does is wipe that out and say, no,

12

it's one size fits all, and then what's ­­ and that one

13

size that fits all is that nobody can participate, not

14

even the 24 States that want to do it.
