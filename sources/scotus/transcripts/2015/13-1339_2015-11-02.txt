ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. ANDREW J. PINCUS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

This Court has said that the irreducible

11

constitutional minimum for standing is injury in fact;

12

that the plaintiff suffered actual or imminent, tangible

13

harm.

14

In Lujan, the Court said that Congress may

15

elevate to the status of legally­cognizable injuries,

16

concrete, de facto injuries that were previously

17

inadequate in law.

18

Here, the Ninth Circuit held that there's no

19

need for any de facto injury.

20

that in some general sense relates to the plaintiff is

21

all that's necessary, even though it has no tangible ­­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

MR. PINCUS:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

A statutory violation

Why is it you think ­­

­­ consequences ­­
Let's say I agree with you

that there needs to be a concrete injury; that Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

needs to have recognized something that looks like a

2

concrete injury.

3

Congress did here?

4

hypothetical.

5

But why isn't that exactly what
So let me just frame it in a

Suppose that there's just a statute ­­ it's

6

a little bit of a simpler statute, and you can argue

7

with me or tell me why it might or might not be

8

different, but I just want to understand your position.

9

Suppose that there is a statute that just

10

says that one of these credit reporting agencies shall

11

not disseminate inaccurate information about people, or

12

shall ­­ shall not do it willfully or negligently or

13

what have you, but shall not disseminate inaccurate

14

information about people.

15

action that says if they disseminate inaccurate

16

information in a credit report about you, you can sue.

17

All right?

And then there's a cause of

18

Is that enough of a concrete injury for you?

19

MR. PINCUS:

20

No, it's not, for ­­ for three

reasons, Your Honor.

21

And let me preface my response by saying

22

that, of course, that isn't the case with respect to

23

three of the claims in this case, which don't have

24

anything to do with inaccuracy.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

But let me focus on

1

what seems to be ­­

2

MR. PINCUS:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

I'm happy to focus ­­
­­ the gravamen of the

claim.

5

And why isn't the dissemination of false

6

information about you in a credit report, why isn't

7

that ­­ why isn't it ­­ it perfectly sufficient if

8

Congress says that's a concrete injury?

9

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I ­­ I guess as a

10

threshold matter, I think what the Court has said in

11

other contexts is that Congress should clearly say that

12

it is going beyond the tangible injuries that this Court

13

has defined.

14

The Court has had a clear statement rule.
And so another difference between your

15

hypothetical ­­ I'm not sure whether your hypothetical

16

casts Congress clearly saying, and by the way, we are

17

creating a cause of action for people who otherwise

18

couldn't get into court.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

MR. PINCUS:

21
22
23

I'm sorry.

Let me start ­­ well, maybe I

can answer your question this way.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

You said that there were

reasons why that was not a concrete injury ­­

24

MR. PINCUS:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
­­ the dissemination of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

false information about a particular person.

2
3

Why?

Because to me, I'll just say, seems

like a concrete injury to me.

4

MR. PINCUS:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

somebody did it to me I'd feel harmed.

Well, first ­­ first of all ­­
You know?

If ­­ I mean, if

7

And I think that if you went out on the

8

street and you did a survey, most people would feel

9

harmed.

Most people would feel as though they had some

10

interest that had been invaded.

11

that, thought it was a significant problem, passed a

12

statute to deal with that problem.

13

MR. PINCUS:

And Congress recognized

First of all, the ­­ the common

14

law tradition, which the Court has looked to, did not

15

say that the dissemination of any false statement was an

16

injury.

17

To prove defamation ­­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's quite right.

It's

19

not ­­ it's not completely in the common law tradition.

20

But we've said many times that Congress gets to look

21

beyond the common law tradition and gets to identify

22

real world problems out there in the world, harming

23

people in real­world ways.

24

Congress did here.

25

MR. PINCUS:

And that, it seems, is what

Well, let me answer your

question in two ways.

2

it isn't, and then I also want to explain why it's not

what Congress did here.

I ­­ I want to explain why ­­ why

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can ­­ can you explain,

then, the common law versus the legislature?

So if we

10

have some historic practice where damages are awarded to

11

someone who has no out­of­pocket loss, if the common law

12

says so it's okay but if Congress says so it's not?

13

That's very strange.

14

MR. PINCUS:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

15

I think ­­ well, this question takes me a little afield

16

from ­­ from Justice Kagan's question.

17

common law had some very specific areas where it defined

18

actual harm; for example, any intrusion on a property

19

right is actual harm, but there has to be a property

20

right for that to be so.

21
22
23

But I think the

So I think Congress could create a property
right.

And if it did that ­­

And ­­ and the question is ­­

10

there are several ways that they can establish standing.

in the standing context.

The Court has also ­­ it is also clear that

And the Court

17

in the property rights context, when Congress just

18

doesn't create ­­ or the common law doesn't just create

19

a right to sue but confers a property right, the right

20

to exclude, generally, as the Court has put it, that any

21

intrusion on that property right, on that right to

22

exclude, is tangible harm.

23

And the Court has made clear in the ­­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

So if I have a dozen or

more cases that didn't involve property rights, where we

didn't require economic harm, those would mean nothing

to you?

that meet that test.

It's not just economic harm.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It

Well, what's the answer,

then, to Justice Kagan's question?

14

MR. PINCUS:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

I ­­

You said it could be

16

psychic harm, there could be economic harm, there could

17

be all different kinds of harm.

18

isn't what she said right, that one kind of harm could

19

be the harm suffered when somebody tells a lie about

20

you, or gives false information?

And that being so, why

21

What's different?

22

MR. PINCUS:

23

If I can just finish my answer to ­­ to

It could be.

24

Justice Sotomayor, because I just want to make clear,

25

and I think the College Savings case is a perfect

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

analogy here, that every cause of action does not confer

2

a property right.

3

that's why the property right rationale doesn't apply

4

here.

5

The Court there made that clear, and

Now, turning back to Justice Kagan's

6

question, I think there are other areas, other than

7

defamation where there's some guidance about what

8

constitutes tangible harm.

9

For example, in the False Light cases, the

10

restatement has a comment that I think ­­ this is a

11

Restatement (Second) of Torts 652E, comment (c) that's

12

very on point.

13

It says, "Complete and perfect accuracy of

14

published reports concerning any individual is seldom

15

attainable by any reasonable effort.

16

such as a wrong address or a mistake in the date of

17

employment, or similar unimportant details, would

4

And I'm

So there is some legal precedents that tells
us ­­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Here's the thing,

7

Mr. Pincus.

8

that we have to say Congress is better at than we are is

9

identifying concrete harms.

It seems to me that the ­­ the one thing

I mean, it's perfectly

10

fine, and I agree with very large portions of your brief

11

when you say they have to have identified a concrete

12

harm.

13

It's like, fine, yes, they do.
But now the question is, did they identify

14

one?

15

here; that this statute is entirely about preventing the

16

dissemination of inaccurate information in credit

17

reports which they seem to think is both something that

18

harms the individual personally and also harms larger

19

systemic issues.

20

to the people it harmed personally.

21

And it seems pretty clear what they wanted to do

And then they gave the cause of action

And I guess ­­ I mean, don't we owe them a

22

little bit of respect that they've actually identified a

23

real­world harm that it ­­ that's out there?

24
25

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think there's a

threshold assumption in your question that Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

12
1

actually identified that as a real­world harm.

2

think there are two problems with that.

3

And I

First of all, the structure of the statute

4

indicates that that's not so.

5

6

every violation of the statute that's willful, including

7

those that don't involve false statements.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, how much more do you

15

think the plaintiff in this case would have to allege or

16

prove in order to show injury in fact?

Is it different because this is a credit

Does a credit agency have less latitude when

it is defending on the ground of no concrete injury than

other entities?

5

threshold question, Your Honor, of whether Congress made

the determination that there should be a different

7

treatment for ­­ for credit agencies.

3

identified a concrete harm.

4

MR. PINCUS:

Well, a couple of responses to

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Of course, harms can arise

in the world, and can be identified in the world even

before.

13

MR. PINCUS:

But the ­­ but the Court's ­­ I

think the question ­­ and I take the burden of my

friend's argument to be that Congress can define things

16

as sufficient to satisfy standing, even if they

17

wouldn't, if they just were asserted at a court,

18

satisfied the tangible harm requirement.

Mr. Pincus, I would have

It identified as the harm the failure to follow the ­­

6

the procedures that it imposed upon credit reporting

agencies.

It did not.

It said nothing about people who ­­ who have

see how you can say that a cause of action that says

Are you saying in this

case that Congress could have drafted a statute that

would allow this individual to bring suit?

2

MR. PINCUS:

I think Congress ­­ yes, I

3

think it might be possible.

4

Justice Kennedy.

5

And let me explain how,

I think, first of all, to respond to one of

6

Justice Kagan's earlier questions, I don't think it's

7

crystal clear what Congress was doing here because I

8

think the most likely interpretation of this provision

9

was it was enacted against the background of this

10

Court's jurisprudence, which requires tangible harm.

11

And it ­­ what Congress was most likely

12

saying was, we know that quantifying, monetizing that

13

tangible harm in this context is hard.

14

willful violation, we're going to give you a minimum

15

recovery.

16

So if there's a

I think the reason why it makes sense to

17

require Congress to speak clearly, if it is going beyond

18

what this Court has required for tangible harm, is

19

precisely because it is necessary to identify that

20

Congress actually intends to give access to the Federal

21

courts beyond that which would be true under this

22

Court's otherwise applicable jurisdiction ­­ rule.

23

it didn't do that here because of the willfulness

24

layered on top of all of the statutory violations.

25

And

And I think also, the fair way of looking at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26

this statute is as a complex of regulations which

2

Congress thought, taken together, would improve

3

accuracy.

4

I don't think you can say that any single

one of them ­­ the violation of any single one of them,

injury on some person that they should be entitled to ­­

9
10

Thank you, Counsel.

Mr. Robins has Article III standing for
three independent reasons.

11

First, the violation of the statutory rights

12

under the Fair Credit Reporting Act constitutes injury

13

in fact.

14

Second, even if not, his entitlement to

15

monetary relief as a consequence of that violation shows

16

he has the personal stake that Article III requires.

17

And third, the fact that his claim follows

18

from the common law of defamation conclusively

establishes that it is a case or controversy within the

meaning of Article III.

What I do see, going back to Camp, which is

things:

One, that the harm is not speculative.

not to play word games, but I think it means that you

So I think the ­­ the Court

uses the phrase "concrete and particularized."

two companion words, I think, getting at these same

12

concepts.

13

Now, two things have to happen:

That's

One, to

14

show that it's a differentiated claim, that it's not a

generalized grievance, you have to identify a subclass

of people who are distinctly harmed other than the

MR. CONSOVOY:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So ­­
Now, does that

individual have injury in fact because the statute has

24

been violated with respect to him?

25

MR. CONSOVOY:

that statute would apply to everybody in the country.

There would be no ­­

Every individual who you publish information about gets

$10 a year.

MR. CONSOVOY:

Right.

So I think that would

make it particularized but not concrete.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So there'd be no

standing ­­ that person would have no standing, even

11

though Congress gave him standing?

12

MR. CONSOVOY:

Congress can confer

substantive rights that lead to standing.

You said you ­­ you need for the information

to mean that the class, as you've defined it, is not

going to be certified.

24

the ­­ we're on the same page here.

25

That is going

Yes.

So the class was ­­ and

Alderson Reporting Company

this is going to come up later this term in the Tyson

was because of what's called a failsafe problem.

But the class has to be defined as broadly as it

4

You can't identify a class by an element of

5

the cause of action, and that's because it harms

6

defendants' rights.

7

was everybody who had inaccurate information, it would

8

be a trick against them, because if they defeated the

claim, the class would be empty, and they would get no

So if we had alleged the class here

11

So at certification, we're going to have to

12

narrow the class, and we're going to have to come up

13

with common proof because we can't identify the class by

14

the allegation.

15

So what happens is, take the algorithm

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

In Defenders of Wildlife, the Court gave the
following description of what injury in fact means:

Alderson Reporting Company

It

said injury in fact is, quote, "an invasion of a

2

legally­protected interest which is, A, concrete and

particularized, and, B, actual or imminent, not

conjectural or hypothetical."

5

And so the injury part of it was the

6

invasion of a legally­protected injury ­­ interest.

7

I think it's clear what work the words "in fact" are

8

doing in that description.

9

And

If Mr. Robins had alleged that Spokeo is

10

circulating a lot of inaccurate consumer reports and I'm

11

afraid they'll do one about me, that wouldn't be good

How ­­ how ­­ the

difference is that this is dealing with the requirement

actual injury.

That's what makes it a decision appropriate

for resolution by the judicial branch.

little bit more important than saying you can challenge

particular statutes.

16

MR. STEWART:

And it seems a

Well, the point is ­­ I was

17

trying to make was that Congress has been doing this

18

since 1790, and nobody's pointed to a statute that comes

19

close to the hypotheticals.

that's not what the Ninth Circuit based its decision on.

The Ninth Circuit says he had standing by virtue of the

alleged violations of his statutory rights, without

19

respect to whether there was harm to his employment

20

process or related anxiety.

21

So I would suppose, if we're going to decide

it on that basis, we have to determine that the Ninth

Circuit's rationale was in ­­ was wrong.

MR. STEWART:

I'm sorry I don't have the

exact wording in front of me, but if you look at the

Defenders of Wildlife is the statute at issue in that

5

case said any person can sue to complain about

6

particular types of Endangered Species Act violations.

7

And the Court said, that's just too broad.

8

can't do that.

9

Congress

But it didn't say, therefore, the

10

authorization to sue is a nullity, and we don't have to

11

worry about whether this plaintiff has standing to sue.

12

It analyzed in depth the allegations and the evidence

13

that the particular plaintiffs in Defenders of Wildlife

14

had put forward and said this is insufficient.

15

And then later, in Bennett v. Spear, the

16

Court applied the same Endangered Species Act provision

17

at the behest of a plaintiff who did have standing.

18

So it isn't the case that, if Congress fails

to draw exactly the right line, people who would have

as the Court comes ­­ the ­­ the question presented was

10

does the Ninth Circuit's rule that a mere statutory

11

violation unaccompanied by any harm is sufficient to

12

satisfy Article III?

13

I think the Court has to address that issue.

14

The next issue is:

Did Congress elevate ­­

15

did ­­ did Congress say that false statements inflict a

16

certain kind of harm, and therefore, we're going to

have to at least show falsity.

No surprise

There has been no decision interpreting the

statute in the context of a willfulness claim to say

whether it does.
