Mr. Jaffe.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIK S. JAFFE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JAFFE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents two questions concerning

12

the consequences of the failure to object or raise an

13

issue at trial.

14

On the question of whether jury instructions

15

not objected to by the government become the baseline

16

for measuring the sufficiency of the evidence at later

17

stages in the case, the critical point here is that only

18

the jury can determine that a defendant is guilty.

19

if a jury does so under a particular framework, it

20

should be evaluated under that framework.

21

cannot sustain that verdict on the reasons it used in

22

its own deliberations, that verdict is not rational.

23

In ­­

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

And

And if it

Well, there ­­ there's ­­

there's no doubt in this case, is there, that the jury

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had

2

committed a crime set forth in the indictment?

3

MR. JAFFE:

Your Honor, I think that is not

4

entirely correct.

5

sufficient evidence that they could have done that.

6

Whether they did that is ­­

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. JAFFE:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

something else, isn't ­­ wasn't that ­­

There is no doubt there was

They ­­ they had to.

­­ a different matter.

11

MR. JAFFE:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. JAFFE:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They had to find that, plus

So ­­
­­ that the issue?

It was the issue.
So if ­­ if they came in

15

and said both are true, the first has to ­­ has to have

16

been true.

17

MR. JAFFE:

In the Fifth Circuit, we pointed

18

out that there was the potential for confusion the way

19

"and" could have been misread by them as "or," and they

20

would not have necessarily had unanimity on ­­ on which

21

elements of the "and" added up.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't read that as being

a part of your case here.
MR. JAFFE:

It is only so indirectly.

So we

raised this as plain error, and we lost that because we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

couldn't demonstrate prejudice because there was some

2

uncertainty.

3

Our point in this Court is that, if the

4

government wants to ignore or have a court disregard the

5

instructions, it would then be its burden to prove

6

harmlessness, and that same uncertainty about unanimity

7

would then redound to our benefit.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well ­­ well, the ­­ the

"or" would have been accurate, wouldn't it have?

10

MR. JAFFE:

Well, the "or" would have been

11

accurate, but would have required a unanimity

12

instruction to be clear which of the "ors" they agreed

13

on.

14

it was "unauthorized," that is a ­­ not a valid verdict.

If six thought it was "exceeding" and six thought

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

On the basis of the

16

argument in this case, I didn't think there was any

17

argument that the government tried this case solely on

18

the theory that he encourage others to exceed their

19

authority.

20

MR. JAFFE:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

the case.

23

harmless error?

24
25

I think ­­
That's how they argued

That's how it was indicted.

MR. JAFFE:

So why isn't it

Well, because the evidence is

not sufficient to actually support that conclusion.

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

6
1

government certainly argued that.

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's not sufficient to

support the conclusion that he exceeded authority.

4

MR. JAFFE:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
But it is more than

6

sufficient, if not the only theory they could have

7

convicted on, was that they ­­ that he had encouraged

8

others to exceed their authority.

9

MR. JAFFE:

No.

I ­­ I ­­ I disagree, Your

10

Honor.

11

if one accepts all those facts as true, still would not

12

constitute exceeding authority.

We argue that what he encouraged others to do,

13

That the government's ­­

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

Could I ask you ­­ I'm

sorry.

16

MR. JAFFE:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

MR. JAFFE:

Yes.
You wanted to finish that.

I was saying the government's

19

theory about what is and is not exceeding authority is

20

somewhat confused in this case as it was confused in the

21

presentation at the trial level; and therefore, it

22

wouldn't have been clear that that evidence would have

23

been sufficient to show conspiracy to exceed.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

It doesn't seem clear to me

that these two theories are actually separate.

Alderson Reporting Company

They ­­

they ­­ when Congress enacts a criminal statute, it

2

often adds a lot of synonyms.

7

unauthorized access and exceeding authorized access.

So, you know, in the ­­

Let's take the first, making unauthorized

Let's say somebody has access to some ­­ an

11

12

13

and starts looking through files, that person is making

14

unauthorized access.

15

If that employee

And in the other situation, exceeding

16

authorized access, let's say a person doesn't have

17

any ­­ any access to any files in the court, but sneaks

18

in and looks at those files.

19

authorized access and, therefore, exceeded authorized

20

access.

21

That person had zero

I just think these are ­­ it seems to me,

22

reading them, they're two ways of saying the same thing.

23

Your Honor, that question is

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If I could go back to your

main argument.

thought process was in the jury room; but it is, indeed,

could any jury in the position of this jury, with the

facts this jury received, with the instructions this

13

jury received, could possibly have come to this

conclusion?

15

And our point is no rational jury facing the

facts and instructions this jury faced could have

convicted on the exceeding portion of the charge.

attention away from a critical element.

don't see that that's a possibility here, even assuming

To show that the charge

met ­­ the charge ­­ the evidence proved the crime on

13

14

MR. JAFFE:

But the reasons behind Jackson

15

explain that we are looking to whether or not the jury

16

could have rationally reached that conclusion.

17

reason we do so is to enforce the presumption of

18

innocence and to enforce the reasonable doubt

And the

So if a jury instructed erroneously that the

21

person needed to be wearing a green hat, had zero

22

evidence that that person was wearing a green hat, yet

23

found that they were wearing a green hat anyway, there

24

is a problem in that verdict, and we know there's a

25

problem in that verdict.

No rational jury could find

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

My problem is that I

3

don't know that it's rational to say that a jury in ­­

4

that sufficiency of the evidence has to do with what was

charged as ­­ what was charged to the jury as opposed to

MR. JAFFE:

I'm not aware of one where that

24

has come up.

so­called law­of­the­case doctrine.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose that there's a ­­

3

that there's a two­count indictment and there's plenty

4

of evidence to convict on Count I and zero evidence, not

5

one scintilla of evidence, on Count II, and the jury

6

convicts on both counts; so the ­­ defendant is entitled

7

to a judgment of acquittal on Count II.

8
9

But you seem to be saying in that situation,
the court would say, this is a crazy jury.

This is an

10

irrational jury because their verdict on Count II is

11

totally ridiculous; and therefore, the defendant is

12

entitled to judgment of acquittal on Count I as well,

13

despite the fact that there's plenty of evidence on

14

Count I.

15

Is that what you're saying?

16

MR. JAFFE:

Not entirely.

It is certainly a

17

reasonable conclusion from the implications of Jackson

18

v. Virginia.

However ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what's different ­­

20

what's the difference between that and the argument you

21

just made?

22

MR. JAFFE:

This Court has treated separate

23

counts as significant and distinct ­­ the Smith case,

24

for example, that the government cites.

25

that ­­ I'm not sure that's the right answer in an

Alderson Reporting Company

And given

abstract term, but given that, I believe the same thing

2

would be true where the jury made a terrible decision on

3

one count and an acceptable decision on another count,

4

that you wouldn't cross, in fact, from one count to the

5

other.

6

I could see the argument perfectly well, if

7

this Court were inclined to go there, that yes, a jury

8

that went that off the rails on one count is

9

questionable on everything it did.

And one might well

10

question under the Jackson rationale whether or not they

11

properly applied the presumption of innocence and the

12

reasonable doubt standards.

On the statute of limitations, both parties

17

agree that it is inevitable that a court will review a

18

forfeited limitations bar.

19

or sooner is really the only question before this Court

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you are, Mr. Jaffe, at

whenever a statute of limitations is involved in every

5

case, the defendant can raise it for the first time on

6

appeal, every statute of limitations.

7

MR. JAFFE:

Yes, though the theory under

instances, it would be as a plain­error question; in

23

MR. JAFFE:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's true.
And your jurisdictional

argument surprised me because you cite a line of cases

2

MR. JAFFE:

The distinction between

claim processing and jurisdictional was to cut back on

exorbitant use of jurisdiction, and you just seemed to

MR. JAFFE:

I start with the case of

Bowles v. Russell, and merely point out that, on pretty

much every single ground in that case and those that

10

follow, this statute is stronger and more clearly a

11

limitation of the court's power.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought Bowles went on

13

that the Court had held that before, and so it was going

14

to adhere to its prior ruling.

Because ­­ because I believe the

6

wording of this statute is, in fact, unusually strong,

7

particularly with the "except as otherwise expressly

8

provided by law," meaning you cannot avoid it by

9

implication.

It is such a strongly worded statute.

10

Others might not be that way at all, and one would not

20

according to Wong.

21

In other words, just a

That's the way I would read that.

MR. JAFFE:

I would read those cases as

22

dealing with civil situations as opposed to criminal

23

situations, where the limitations period is generally

24

thought of as a period of repose, not as a substantive

25

limit on the government's power.

And that's the Toussie

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28

case, as well as Benes, which followed that.

2

I would also point out that the ­­ the

3

clarity of Congress's language goes to, are you limiting

4

the court, as opposed to merely requiring bringing the

5

claim within a certain period of time, but without

6

specifying the consequence of failure.

Here, the language is so expressly directed

to the court's power, and it does indeed specify the

consequences of failure:

You may not try or punish any

person.

But are you saying that we

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

23
24
25

MR. MARTINEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner is wrong that the sufficiency of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

the evidence must be measured against an extra element

2

in an obviously erroneous jury instruction.

3

is not consistent with the purpose of sufficiency

4

review, it contradicts how this Court has treated the

5

same issue in civil cases, and its whole purpose and

6

effect is to give guilty defendants windfall acquittals.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That rule

If it was obviously

8

wrong, why did the government the first time, in the

9

original indictment, charge "and"?

10

MR. MARTINEZ:

I ­­ it ­­ it was obviously

11

wrong to include the ­­ the ­­ the exceeding authorized

12

access component to the case at the jury instruction

13

stage after the superseding indictments had already made

14

clear that the case was about a conspiracy to commit

15

unauthorized access.

16

And I think my ­­ my friend on the other

17

side pointed out that ­­ that ­­ that Petitioner's

18

counsel was confused as to what the case was about at

19

that stage, but if you look at what Petitioner said the

20

case was about when he was briefing this case in the

21

Fifth Circuit, he made very, very clear that, in

22

Petitioner's view, the government had abandoned the

23

conspiracy to commit exceeding authorized access, and it

24

had abandoned that with its superseding indictments, and

25

it had abandoned that by the fact that, when we proposed

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

three different sets of jury instructions as to the

2

conspiracy count, the ­­ the instructions that we

3

proposed were limited to a conspiracy to commit

4

unauthorized access.

5

Petitioner's other counsel, Mr. Kendall,

6

during his oral argument in the Fifth Circuit, over and

7

over again ­­ at the beginning of his argument, in the

8

middle of his argument, at the end of his argument ­­

9

emphasized that the government had tried this case as a

10

"unauthorized access case from start to finish."

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why didn't the government

12

ask the judge to correct his charge when the judge made

13

the mistake of saying "and"?

JUSTICE ALITO:

That ­­ that would have

Well, why was the

instruction erroneous?

12

13

not just different ways of describing the same thing?

14

You concede that these two

MR. MARTINEZ:

They're

We do think that they are

15

discrete, and we think that's consistent with our ­­ our

16

sort of general reading of the statute and with the way

17

the courts have ­­ have addressed it.

18

very closely related.

19

I think they're

I think what ­­ we agree with what ­­ what

20

Petitioner said in his petition at page 4, which was

21

that ­­ that these are essentially two different ways of

22

committing the same crime.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose you had an

24

indictment charging someone with exceeding authorized

25

access and there was a factual dispute about, let's say,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

the date on which the employee's employment ended, so

2

therefore, the date on which any authorized access that

3

the employee had to records of the employer ended, you

4

would say that, if you did not succeed in proving beyond

5

a reasonable doubt that, as of the date when the access

6

was obtained, the employee had ceased to be employed,

7

that that employee would be entitled to a judgment of

8

acquittal?

9

That seems rather odd.
MR. MARTINEZ:

Justice Alito, I don't ­­ I

10

don't want to resist a broader reading of the statute,

11

but I ­­ I would only say that ­­ that the statute

12

defines the term "exceeding authorized access" in a

13

way ­­ this is at page 11a of our statutory appendix.

14

It said, "The term" ­­ it says, "The term 'exceeds

15

authorized access' means to access a computer with

16

authorization and then to use such access to obtain or

17

alter information in the computer that the accessor is

18

not entitled so to obtain."

19

So if there were a circumstance in which

20

there was no authorization in the first place to ­­ to

21

access the computer, I think we would be in trouble.

22

But we would, of course, have the other ­­ the other way

23

of ­­ of proving that the statute had been violated,

24

which was the unauthorized access charge.

25

And that's why in this case, I think, there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

was no dispute and there was no confusion whatsoever

2

that a conspiracy to commit unauthorized access was

3

alleged.

4

Petitioner hasn't challenged on that point, and there

5

were, of course, two substantive convictions that ­­

6

Counts II and III of the indictment ­­ which had to do

7

with ­­ with unauthorized access.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

­­ in the same way that

10

you're suggesting here we shouldn't look to the

11

instructions?

12

MR. MARTINEZ:

I ­­ I think what the ­­ the

13

purpose of the indictment is to give the defendant

14

notice of the ­­ the crime with which he is charged.

15

But a lot of times, as the Court well knows, the

16

indictment is going to be a lengthy document that

17

contains a lot of allegations, a lot of different facts.

18

And what this Court has made clear is that, just because

19

the indictment says something happened at a certain time

20

or ­­ or in the narrative of a description of the

21

offense it includes some information, that doesn't mean

22

that the government is required to prove everything

23

that's identified there.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But ­­ but I guess I ­­ it

is ­­ that does seem a little bit troubling to me just

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38

because of the function of an indictment is providing

2

notice, that if the indictment gets the statute wrong,

3

that ­­ that the government should be stuck with that

4

because that's what ­­ you know, that's what the

5

defendant now thinks is the charge.

6

MR. MARTINEZ:

I ­­ I think that, in a case

like ­­ and I ­­ it may be that ­­ that in a different

8

case where ­­ I would have to see the indictment

9

that they ­­ you're hypothesizing, Justice Kagan.

But

10

in a case like this, where the indictment says this is

11

the statutory offense and ­­ and ­­ and it ­­ and it

12

identifies the statutory code provision and it says

13

"unauthorized access," so it makes clear that the

14

conspiracy being alleged here is the unauthorized access

15

branch of a 1030(a)(2) violation.

16

I think that ­­ that shows you what the ­­

17

you know, that points to the law that needs to be

18

applied.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the

20

government agreed that, if the charge in the indictment

21

was "and," A "and" B, the government would have to prove

22

A and B ­­ if that was what the indictment charged.

23

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think if the ­­ if the

24

indictment had said that the conspiracy here was to

25

do ­­ was ­­ was to do A and B, the normal rule is that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

if the ­­ that charge says "A and B," the government

2

could nonetheless prove the conspiracy theory under A or

3

B, and then the jury instructions could ­­ could so

4

specify.

5

And so I think ­­ I ­­ I think that's ­­

6

that's fairly well­established that the government can

7

charge in the conjunctive in that sense.

8
9

But I think what's important for this case
is that the ­­ the indictment in this case was very

10

specific.

11

which had the ­­ alleged the broader conspiracy to ­­ to

12

both commit unauthorized access and to exceed authorized

13

access, and it went to a narrower conspiracy that just

14

charged unauthorized access.

15

It changed from the original indictment,

And that's why Petitioner's counsel said

16

repeatedly in his briefs and at oral argument on appeal,

17

this was an unauthorized access case from start to

18

finish.

significant here, which is that his rule is only going

time.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. MARTINEZ:

That's true.
So I think his second

7

argument is that he ­­ he can get de novo review even if

it's not jurisdictional if he raises it for the first

time on appeal.

10
11

And I think his third argument is he has ­­
he can get plain­error review.

12

We think each of these arguments is wrong.

13

First of all, with respect to the

14

jurisdictional point, this Court has said for over 140

15

years that the statute of limitations is a matter of

16

defense that the defendant has the burden of introducing

17

into the case.

18

idea that the statute of limitations is jurisdictional,

19

which would mean that the government, as the ­­ the ­­

20

the party invoking the jurisdiction of the court, would

21

have the burden of establishing compliance with the

22

statute of limitations.

23

That's completely contradictory to the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do you deal with his

argument that we should ­­ if, in a civil case, we make

a presumption that a statute of limitations is a

MR. MARTINEZ:

that ­­ that the statute of limitations is a matter of

defense that has to be introduced into the case by the

defendant.

15

I think that ­­

And I think if ­­ if Petitioner's primary

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why shouldn't the rule in

23

this context be the same as the rule for timely filing a

24

Federal habeas petition?

25

MR. MARTINEZ:

Well, I think that ­­ for ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

for a couple reasons, the most important of which is

2

that Rule 52(b) governs this case where Rule 52(b) does

3

not directly govern the filing of a ­­ of a habeas

4

petition.

5

And so Rule 52(b) makes clear that the ­­

6

the exclusive means by which a criminal defendant can

7

obtain appellate review of a ­­ of a claimed error where

8

they didn't object below is by satisfying the four­prong

9

Olano standard.

10

And in the habeas context, that rule

doesn't apply.

11

If you look at the Court's analysis in one

12

of the habeas cases, which was drawn on by the other,

13

the Day v. McDonough case, the Court emphasized that its

14

holding was valid there because, in part, there was no

15

rule to the contrary.

16

contrary.

Here you have a rule to the

17

I think the second point that could be made

on those ­­ on that ­­ on this front is that the habeas

context is special.

20

in both Day and in Wood v. Milyard really emphasize that

21

what's driving those cases is a desire to have a rule

22

that ­­ that takes account of the habeas context, the

23

desire to have finality with respect to criminal

24

convictions, and the desire to harmonize the rule that

25

applies to statute of limitations with the rules that

And I think the Court's decisions

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

apply to other threshold barriers to habeas relief.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

You think that the State's

3

interest in the habeas context in finality and comity is

4

stronger than the defendant's interest in a direct

5

criminal appeal in requiring that the charge be filed on

6

time where what's at stake is ­­ is a criminal

7

conviction?

8

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think that ­­ that ­­ I

9

think that criminal defendants are obviously going to

10

have an interest in raising arguments that they think

11

are meritorious when they didn't raise it below.

12

think that there's a very significant legal difference

13

in that those types of policy concerns don't really ­­

14

are not really applicable in ­­ when you're talking

15

about a direct appeal because Rule 52(b) sort of blocks

And I also think that the ­­ the reasoning

of cases like Day and Wood really does turn on the fact

Bear in mind I dissented in

11

MR. MARTINEZ:

As I recall, Your Honor, I

12

think ­­ I think there's a ­­ there's a couple of

13

reasons.

14

habeas context is that the record can be developed.

15

When you're looking at a case on Rule 52(b), this Court

16

has always treated review under 52(b) as being limited

17

to the existing record, whereas in habeas case, the

18

record can be developed.

19

The strongest is that the difference in the

And that's very important in two fundamental

20

ways.

21

not raised by the defendant at the appropriate time.

22

The ­­ the defendant is going to have ­­ and including

23

in this case, could have a very strategic reason for not

24

raising the defense during the trial.

25

First, it's important to know why the defense was

And I can get into that in ­­ in ­­ in this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

particular case if the Court is interested.

2

In the second ­­ so that's one reason why

3

it's important to have a record.

4

is the government has to have the ability to ­­ to

5

introduce evidence if it wants to rebut or establish

6

compliance with the statute­of­limitations defense.

7

And the second reason

That's what this Court said in Cook.

In

8

Cook the whole point of the case was that it's unfair

9

to ­­ to allow for a ­­ a ­­ a indictment to be

10

dismissed on a demurrer because that would deprive the

11

government of its right to reply and give evidence to

12

establish compliance with the statute of limitations

13

once the defense is raised.

14

So on ­­ on direct review, the record would

15

be frozen and you wouldn't be able to look out outside

16

the record, whereas on habeas you would be able to look

17

outside the record.

18

And in addition, I think the ­­ it's very

19

important to ­­ to sort of look at the theoretical basis

20

for the ­­ the error and ­­ and ­­ and recognize that it

23

First of all, Rule 52(b) is generally about

24

things that the trial judge is supposed to notice on his

25

own.

And what this Court has said about statute of

don't think that an error is plain on the record because

10

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think that's very, very

11

likely that the trial court might do that.

12

would think that, because there are sometimes strategic

13

reasons for not raising the defense, you know, the ­­

14

the trial judge should do it in a way that it doesn't

interfere with those strategic concerns.

16

I ­­ we

We don't think that there is a problem if

the judge does it that way, but we certainly don't think

there's an obligation, and we don't think it's an error

if the judge doesn't do that.

20
21
22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What type of

strategic reason are you talking about?
MR. MARTINEZ:

Well, I think there ­­ there

23

could be a couple of them.

24

the ­­ the original indictment was undoubtedly filed

25

within the limitations period.

In this case, for example,

Now that indictment was

3

superseded indictment's out of time because it doesn't

relate back and he had won, the effect of that would

5

have been just to resurrect the original indictment

6

which had never been dismissed.

But if the defendant had raised in a

7

And so if he had actually raised this before

8

trial and he had succeeded on his statute­of­limitations

9

challenge to the superseding indictment, we would have

10

just been back in the world where the original

11

indictment applied.

12

original indictment was somewhat broader than ­­ than

13

the superseding indictment.

And, as the Court has noted, the

14

And so that might have been a good reason.

15

In another case, the ­­ there may be

16

circumstances in which a defendant's

17

statute­of­limitations defense will be in contradiction

18

to his defense of innocence.

19

to say, I was in Hawaii when the crime was committed,

20

and it's another thing to say, I committed the crime on

January 1st and not on, you know, March 15th.

22

You know, it's one thing

And so there may ­­ you know, the defendant

17

don't think Nguyen is a ­­ a kind of all­season pass

18

for ­­ for ignoring Rule 52(b).

19

We

And then, finally, with respect to plain

20

error, we think there are two overriding arguments.

21

first one is that we don't think there is an error here.

22

For there to be an error, we think the statute of

23

limitations would need to be something that the ­­ the

24

trial court is supposed to have an obligation to sort

25

out.

The

We don't think the trial court has that obligation

Alderson Reporting Company

because this Court's cases say that ­­ that the statute

2

of limitations is an affirmative defense that has to be

Even if you disagree with us on that, we

think that ­­ that Cook makes clear that, whenever a

opportunity to explain what evidence it would have

stands, the existing record, is not sufficient to

diagnose an error because you would have to essentially

figure out, well, could the government have responded?

15

You know, would they have argued that ­­ that there was

tolling of the statute of limitations?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIK S. JAFFE

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3
4

MR. JAFFE:

On the issue of whether or not

the jury instructions are binding, several points:

5

First of all, the confusion persists to this

6

day.

7

very difficult to see the difference between

8

unauthorized and exceeding authorized access, that too

9

would have infected the jury.

Just as Justice Alito is pointing out that it's

We could not prove it

10

sufficiently to show prejudice, but they cannot prove it

11

sufficiently to show harmlessness or inevitability of a

12

conviction had you not so instructed them.

13

Second of all, I believe that Jackson v.

14

Virginia talks from a jury­centric perspective.

15

issue is not the statute.

16

rational jury could have done what they did.

That's fine.

The government

We absolutely argued that.

But at trial the harm was already done.

6

They confused themselves, they confused the jury, and

7

apparently confused the judge.

8

Third, it seems to me that the phrase

"unauthorized access" is not actually even in the

10

statute, which just goes to my point that there would be

confusion as to access without authorization and access

every court to consider this issue, including the Fifth
