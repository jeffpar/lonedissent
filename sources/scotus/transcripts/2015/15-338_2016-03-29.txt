ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC E. MURPHY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. MURPHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Given resource constraints, Ohio law has

12

always authorized its attorney general to appoint

13

special counsel to undertake the attorney general's

14

duty of representing the State in the courts.

15

the attorney general may appoint general deputies

16

today, special counsel remain integral to the

17

office.

18

assistant attorneys general dedicated to collecting

19

the billions of dollars of State debts scattered

20

across all 88 Ohio counties.

21

must rely on special counsel to be the frontline

22

lawyers to collect these debts, yet the Sixth

23

Circuit in this case held both that special counsel

24

are not attorney general officers and may not use

25

attorney general letterhead without risking

While

For example, the office has only 15

The office necessarily

1

liability under the Fair Debt Collection Practices

2

Act.

3

That was mistaken for two basic reasons.

4

First, special counsel are State officers

5

under that Act.

6

government exemption designed to protect government

7

operations.

8
9

And so they fall within the

And, second, special counsel's use of
attorney general letterhead accurately conveyed

10

their relationship to the office and furthered the

11

purposes of the Act by putting the credibility of

12

the office on the line and giving it a powerful

13

incentive to monitor special counsel when they

14

collect these debts.

15

So I would like to begin first with the

16

first question presented, the officer question.

17

the briefs have gone back and forth on what officer

18

can mean historically and on what it should mean for

19

the Act.

20

the Act is ­­ is that the broadest conceivable

21

definition should apply, precisely because this

22

provision is designed to protect government

23

operations.

24
25

And

I think ­­ I think what it should mean for

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you about

the ­­ the general structure of the Act seems to be

1

in­house collectors are okay, but outside

2

collectors, whether for private or for government,

3

fall under the Act.

4

But do I understand your view correctly

5

that that line doesn't exist for the State; that is,

6

whether it's an in­house or an out­house collector,

7

they're equally exempt?

8
9

MR. MURPHY:

I agree that ­­ I ­­ yes, you

understand our position correctly.

I do not think

10

that the in­house/out­house ­­ outside dichotomy

11

makes sense for purposes of the government

12

exemption.

13

And here's why:

The prototypical ­­ in the

14

legislative history, the sheriffs and marshals, as

15

the prototypical exempt debt collectors for the

16

government, and they are always outside of the

17

private creditors who are the judgment creditors.

18

So there are a core group of outside collectors ­­

19

the in ­­ outside of the creditor, that is ­­ who

20

are the prototypical examples ­­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why wouldn't Congress

22

have expressed that more clearly?

23

big thing that you're saying, that the State debt

24

collectors really ought to be treated very

25

differently, the outside debt collectors from the

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, that's a

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1
2

private.
And, on the face of the statute, the

3

private and the State really are treated in exactly

4

the same way.

5

identically to each other.

6

very clear ways of taking out the State outside debt

7

collectors.

8

aren't debts for purposes of this statute or State

9

outside debt collectors aren't debt collectors for

There are two provisions.

They read

And surely there were

You could have just said State debts

10

purposes of this statute, and yet Congress did none

11

of those things.

12

provisions that seem perfectly parallel with respect

13

to State and corporate entities.

14
15
16

Rather, Congress adopted a set of

MR. MURPHY:

So I disagree that they're

perfectly parallel in these ways.
First, I think "officer" means something

17

different in the government context than it does in

18

the private context.

19

cite Black's Law Dictionary, the prototypical

20

officer is the president, the CEO, or the treasurer,

21

high­level managers.

22

In the private context, as we

But not ­­ that's not true for the

23

government.

24

ministerial officers, like police officers ­­

25

The prototypical Officer can be

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I understand the

Alderson Reporting Company

argument that you can read the same term two

2

different ways, but Congress did use the exact same

3

terms.

4

MR. MURPHY:

But it ­­ but one is in the

5

private context and one is in the government

6

context.

7

have different meanings.

8
9

So I think, by definition, they have to

And, number two, the inside/outside, you
can see that with the creditor, because when the

10

creditor collects, the creditor has to collect in

11

their own name.

12

exemption, (6)(A) ­­ a(6)(A), it says they're exempt

13

if they collect in their own name.

14

If you look at the creditor

And, in fact, when they don't collect in

15

their own name, in­house creditors become debt

16

collectors, showing how the in­house/outside was

17

supposed to work for creditors because, when you put

your ­­ Congress has made the choice with respect to

creditors, when you put your name on the line, the

20

creditor will likely have a repeat relationship with

the relevant debtor.

23

dichotomy ­­

24
25

And so goodwill was enough to

officer nevertheless or an employee of someone?

3

may do it for tax purposes, but we then look at a

4

series of factors to determine whether they're

5

really employees or not.

6

It's hard for you to argue these are

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what other situation

20

have we ever, in any setting, treated someone whom

21

is called an independent contractor, an officer of a

22

company, government agency, anything?

23

novel sort of idea ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the problem I

With corporations, officers are

MR. MURPHY:

But I don't know

Well, so two points:

I think

19

the closest analogy would be ­­ be a common law

20

analogy that court referenced in Filarsky, which

21

were the special deputy sheriffs.

22

treatises treating special deputy sheriffs ­­ those

23

duty for a particular task ­­ as officers within the

meaning of resisting of officer statutes.

Filarsky relied on that history in

determining why the contractors in that case should

be entitled to a qualified immunity.

4

that's the prototypical example.

5

So I think

And we're not ­­ we're not arguing based on

MR. MURPHY:

That's ­­ that's confusing two

On the first question, whether he can

types of debts.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

there, and then ­­ and then I ­­ I ­­ and then you

look ­­ in ­­ for determining what those words mean

6

in the Dictionary Act, I look to history.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I start

Can I ­­ can I ask you,

then, a question about the Dictionary Act?

9

MR. MURPHY:

10

Uh­huh.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Which says an officer

12

the duties of the office."

is ­­ is just which ­­ what is the office there?

MR. MURPHY:

I would ­­ I would call it the

office of special counsel.

16

And my question to you

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The office of special

counsel.

18

MR. MURPHY:

So just like ­­ there's no

19

office of ­­ literally no office of special counsel

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So ­­ but ­­ okay.

So ­­

3

so what does a statute have to do, then, to ­­ to

4

authorize the person to perform the duties of the

5

office?

6

MR. MURPHY:

Usually what the statutes do

7

or what precisely R.C. 109.08 does, it says a

8

superior can appoint ­­ appoint an inferior officer

9

to engage in certain duties.

Like the SG statute to

10

help the ­­ assist the attorney general engage in

11

his duties, that's exactly what this statute says.

12

R.C. 109.08 says the attorney general may appoint

13

special counsel to assist in the ­­ or to represent

14

the State in the collections of these debts.

15

So they say it doesn't even list the duty.

16

I think it lists the precise duty that special

17

counsel are to undertake.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess the question is

19

whether it needs to more authorize an office.

know?

21

you know, these officeholders who come and go, and

22

sometimes there are more of them, and sometimes

there are fewer of them, and sometimes they deal

A continuing, permanent thing as opposed to,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. MURPHY:

I don't think that matters

2

because, I think, historically, there were plenty of

3

offices that had indefinite numbers.

4

instance, assistant U.S. attorneys have indefinite

5

numbers, and they get their duties from their

6

superiors, I think, obviously in the same way.

7

Today, for

And I still think that the special deputy

8

sheriffs are the best historical example.

9

sheriffs were considered to be officers within the

10

meaning of resisting of officer statutes precisely

11

because they were trying to protect government

functions.

14

And those

And I think that purpose analogy is

The point of this exemption is to protect

How was it determined which kind of debt

collector the State is going to use, the one that

would be subject to the Act and the special counsel

4

who would not?

5

MR. MURPHY:

You have to remember that

6

these are lawyers.

7

JA 124 to 130, and let me just explain it briefly.

8
9

And how the process works is at

It starts in­house.

In­house employees of

the office will send letters for most debts on our

10

own letterhead in an attempt to collect in­house.

11

When that proves unsuccessful, we go to third­party

12

vendors, which are essentially collections

13

associations which were the historically reason for

14

this Act.

15

associations.

16

calls.

17

They're not lawyers; they're collections
They send letters and make phone

And that's basically what they do.
And that's the second step.

So most debts

18

will go through this entire process, and so they

19

will be contacted by both these collections

20

associations.

21

And then the third step is special counsel,

22

and the reason why special counsel are generally the

23

third step is because that's when litigation becomes

24

a distinct possibility, so you need lawyers.

25

And that's what special counsel are here to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

18
1

do, which is continue ­­ they continue to send

2

letters, and that's no doubt true, but then they may

3

bring legal options on the table.

4

thousands of suits, as the two special counsel that

5

are involved in this suit have done.

6

They bring

So that's generally how the process works,

7

though ­­ and we've never ­­ we've never contested

8

that the collectors associations are officers within

9

the meaning of the Act.

10

And I think that gets back to the point

11

that our position is not ­­ our position is not that

12

all people collecting debts on behalf of the

13

government are exempt.

14

are.

15

Our position is officers

And so what does "officers" mean?
And there I think you should interpret that

16

broadly because the purpose of that is not to

17

interfere with government operations.

18

this would interfere with our operations in the way

19

the office has long collected the billions of

20

dollars of State debts that it is required via

21

statute to collect.

22

And I think

And getting back to the substantive

23

standards, I do think Filarsky has full application

24

here for why it decided qualified immunity was

25

appropriate in the 1983 context.

I think the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

19
1

special counsel and the attorney general staff work

2

closely together, but then special counsel would be

3

the ones left holding the bag because there is no

4

dispute that the attorney general staff are exempt.

5

And so that would pull in the Filarsky point about

6

maybe it will deter the talented individuals from

7

collecting.

8

government operations.

9

health of the State.

10

Everybody agrees that these are vital
They are vital to the fiscal

And that was a factor that

Filarsky relied on.

11

And then I think the third factor that

12

Filarsky relied on was just the distracting nature

13

of damages suits against the States.

14

this, again, is Exhibit A, because imagine what will

15

happen if this case goes to trial.

It's not just

16

going to involve special counsel.

It will involve

17

our staff who have to respond to discovery and will

18

likely have to testify about how the operations

19

work.

And I think

20

So when they're so closely connected in

21

that way, I do think that it makes sense for the

We always caveated

explain why.

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

23
1

In Germaine the relevant office was the

2

office of pension commissioners, and his job was to

3

dole out pensions to appropriate parties.

4

that was the official duty.

5

did was assist in helping with the duty.

6

And so

And the surgeon, all he

But when somebody else has actually

7

delegated that duty, like a tax collector delegates

8

to a deputy collector of customs, the delegation of

9

the duty, it makes all the distinction in the world.

10

And Auffmordt is on the same basis.

It was

11

a merchant appraiser.

12

was held not to be an officer in the customs office

13

because they weren't actually going out and

14

collecting the relevant customs; they were just

15

helping the collector of customs.

16

And the merchant appraiser

But Steele also makes quite clear that

17

deputy collectors of customs would be officers

18

because that's a situation where the superior

19

officer is actually delegating his authority to the

20

inferior officer there, the deputy.

21

that's the symmetry that matters here.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I think

That seems ­­ if I

23

understood you correctly, that seems an odd line to

24

draw.

25

your authority and delegating part of your

It's the difference between delegating all of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

authority?
MR. MURPHY:

No.

What is the authority?

3

The authority of the attorney general's office and

4

the authority of the tax collector is to represent

5

the State in the court and to bind the State and to

6

bind the third party in the court.

7

associations cannot do that.

8

absolutely do that.

9

Collections

Special counsel

That's their main job.

So just as ­­ for instance, assistant U.S.

10

attorneys would be consider officers because when

11

they stand up in court, they are representing the

12

United States because the statute allows the AG to

13

delegate those official duties to the deputy.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you, Mr. Murphy,

address the point, whether this is misleading?
MR. MURPHY:

Sure.

I'll start at a high

level and then get into the specifics.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In the course of that,

19

the statute says that you cannot falsely represent a

20

21

that part of it.

And if you could address

general's office when special counsel send a letter.

25

The official meaning of "issue" is to distribute in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

25
1

an official capacity.

2

they are distributing them in their official

3

capacity as special counsel to the attorney general.

4

So it's fully appropriate for the office to be

5

listed at the top in those circumstances.

6

When they send these letters,

I would draw, I guess, the analogy to

time through private attorneys nowadays, that the

9

clerk of the court doesn't actually sign the

Courts issue subpoenas all the

10

subpoena anymore, but it has the name of the court

11

at the top, and a private attorney is authorized to

12

issue that subpoena.

14

an easier case, it seems to me, because special

conversation.

2

Congress saw the distinction.

And as two

of the questions from the Court suggested from

Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan, the Act is

It's in the overarching definition of "debt

8

person who regularly collects debts owed another."

I mean, it seems to me that a

that it is signed by an assistant attorney general

why he and the various debt collectors want to use

central premise of this statute, as I said at the

were the ones who were guilty of the worst abuses.

Because outside creditors

10

Outside creditors were the ones who misled, and

11

Congress was trying to make sure that when the

consumer is talking to a debt collector, they knew

13

who they were precisely because the reputational

interests of the attorney general's office are

guarded by people within the attorney general's

questions on the second question presented.

But here there's just ­­ the attorney

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess my point is

12

simply that authorizing use of the seal does suggest

13

a connection with the individual doing the debt

collection work and the attorney general.

15

said there's no way ­­ or they've done everything

16

possible to show there's no connection.

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you

Well ­­
I can't imagine

19

anything they could do more dramatically to ­­ to

20

show that there is a connection than say, "Here, use

21

my letterhead."

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I think if you look

23

at retention agreement, what I meant is they've done

24

everything possible in structuring the relationship

25

between the special counsel and the office of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

52
1

attorney general to make clear that they are not a

2

part of the office.

3

Now, with respect to using the letterhead,

4

I think that's intended to sort of convey a sense of

5

seriousness to debtors who receive the letters.

6

That's the point that ­­ that the State has made.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I expect it's

8

meant to convey that this person is working for us.

9

This person, I, the attorney general, think this is

10

somebody who's acting on my behalf.

11

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, it's true that

12

outside debt collectors are acting on behalf of the

13

creditors who hire them, but that does not make them

14

part of the creditor organization.

15

You know, I think if you look at the

16

definition of "debt collector" and the exemptions

17

whether, with respect to private creditors or ­­ or

18

public creditors, it's clear that Congress intended

19

this statute to apply to independent contractors.

20

But it also intended to allow creditors,

21

whether private or public, to use their own in­house

22

people without being subject to the requirements of

23

the Act.

24
25

And so it's really totally up to the State.
If it's going to use its inside people, then it

doesn't have to comply with the FDCPA.

hires outside third­party contractors, it does.

But when it

3

If I could just address what Justice Breyer

4

was asking about, the use of your true name, I think

5

if you filled out a form that asked for your name

6

and then said, "Have you used any other name?" you

7

would take that to mean as your own name.

8

think that's the sense in which the statute means

9

the use of another name.

10

There's generally ­­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so I

Well, this isn't that.

12

Nobody thinks this person is the attorney general of

13

the State.

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I think ­­

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason that's

16

underlying disturbing me is there is a pretty

17

well­known scam where people get phone calls from a

18

person who identifies himself as somehow connected

19

with the IRS, and you better send them $300 or

20

$3,000 immediately to a certain post office box or

21

you might find yourself in jail.

22

a scam.

Okay?

Now, that's

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if you get a letter

25

out of the blue by somebody purporting to be an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

54
1

official person and there is nothing on the

2

letterhead that suggests that you are such, you

3

might well think, if you've at least had the

4

experience I'm talking about, that this is a scam.

5

And so what the purpose of this letterhead

6

does is it is some indication to the recipient that

7

it's not a scam, and the rest of the letter makes

8

clear precisely what it is.

9

So what I fail to see is anything at all

10

misleading ­­ indeed, to the contrary ­­ in respect

11

to using a letterhead.

12

misleading at all about it, I think I could

13

interpret this statute that requires the contrary

14

requirement in some form or other.

15

MS. HARRINGTON:

And if there is nothing

Well, sir, I disagree that

16

there's nothing misleading about it.

17

gives the impression that the letter was issued by

18

the office of the attorney general, because there is

19

a convention that, when you use the letterhead,

20

that's signaling who the sender of the letter is.

21

law firm would never send a letter using its

22

client's letterhead because that would give the

23

wrong impression about who's sending the letter.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC E. MURPHY

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

14
15

Thank you, counsel.

MR. MURPHY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just a few points.

16

First, going to Justice Kagan's question, I

17

really think they are turning a virtue into a vice

18

here.

19

you ­­ if you look at the tax statute that requires

20

the AG to give this letterhead to special counsel

21

for tax debts, the very next provision ­­ the very

22

next provision of that Act, which was known as the

23

Taxpayer Bill of Rights, the very next provision of

24

that Act requires the AG to appoint problem

25

resolution officers to handle complaints by debtors

They're flipping the Act on its head.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do they know who to

MR. MURPHY:

Precisely because the AG's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does the Act say that

10

MR. MURPHY:

No.

But I think that ­­ that

11

was the point of the law, was to put the letterhead,

12

so they know to call the office.

13

the regular customer service hotline that they can

14

call and they'll ­­ they'll get ­­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And then we have

But that's quite

16

interesting, because the only number that's in these

17

letters is the net ­­ number of the debt collector.

18
19
20

MR. MURPHY:

Well, that's right.

But by

putting the letterhead on the ­­ on ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is there any obligation

21

in the contract for the debt collector, when he

22

receives a customer complaint, to give them the

23

number of the AG's customer service ­­

24
25

MR. MURPHY:

There's not an obligation in

the contract, but there certainly is an obligation

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

61
1

in the contract for them to report that complaint to

2

the AG.

3

And I ­­ I ­­ I think that the AG has

4

interpreted these problem resolution officers more

5

broadly to allow it to handle all sorts of

6

complaints.

7

also significant, because when the AG authorizes

8

these individuals to use the letterhead, that's a

9

powerful incentive on the AG or the AG's office ­­

10
11
12

But I think the reputational idea is

JUSTICE BREYER:
"issued."

It also uses the word

And so what about "issued"?
MR. MURPHY:

Well, I think that ­­ just

13

look at the ­­ we're the only party that has

14

actually cited the dictionary definition of "issue."

15

And the dictionary definition of "issue" is to

16

distribute in their official capacity.

17

So when special counsel send these letters,

18

they are distributing it in their official capacity

19

as special counsel to the attorney general, not as

20

private lawyers with their private law firms.

21

think that's an easy interpretation of "issue" that

22

would authorize the ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if we get to the second

24

question, we've already decided that these people

25

are not officers.

They're independent contractors.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

62
1

They might be agents in a casual sense of the word,

2

but they're not officers.

3

MR. MURPHY:

That's absolutely correct.

4

Our first­level answer would be that they are ­­

5

should be ­­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

So if we assume

7

that they're not officers, then I think Justice

8

Breyer's question holds:

9

person to issue something as opposed to the Ohio ­­

10

MR. MURPHY:

What does it mean for that

I do think that you ­­ I do

11

think that they're distributing it in their official

12

capacity as special counsel.

13

independent contractors, officers, or employees, I

14

think that's a separate question.

15

Whether they're

And then I think it goes to the clear

16

statement rule with respect to Justice Kennedy's

17

comment.

18

etiquette, or of federalism, to suggest that private

19

parties are the ones who get to decide who gets to

20

use an attorney general's letterhead.

I think it's just a fundamental breach of

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23
24
25

May I ask you ­­
I think that

question should be with the attorney general.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's fine.

But as

far as I see it, isn't there one of these two cases

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

63
1

where someone who wasn't the special counsel signed

2

the letter?

3

MR. MURPHY:

That's absolutely true.

But

4

they've waived that argument because their theory of

5

the case is that it's just the letterhead that's

6

misleading.

7

facts of that issue.

And I can easily ­­ I can get into the

balance, and then the Plaintiff turned around and

letter.

She sent the balance on the

So I think they've largely abandoned that
idea that the letterhead was misleading.
