ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

We'll hear argument

MR. WOLFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The basic principle of this Court's

11

timeliness cases, Title VII and otherwise, is that the

12

clock starts when the cause of action is complete.

13

Because a constructive discharge claim is complete only

14

after the employee resigns, this Court should reverse.

15

The court has indicated that limitations

16

principles should be as simple as possible.

17

Circuit's rule, however, injects unnecessary complexity.

18

Identifying the last discriminatory act in an alleged

19

hostile work environment can be difficult.

The Tenth

And as this Court said in early ­­

MR. WOLFMAN:

The matter ­­ the matter

10

alleged is the whole of the claim.

11

say, and as most of the lower courts say, the matter is

12

just a shorthanded way of referring to the cause of

13

action that the ­­ the person is bringing.

14

As the dictionaries

Here, the matter ­­ and this is

15

undisputed ­­ is a constructive discharge which, as this

16

Court said in Suders, has two elements, both the

17

precipitating conduct and the resignation.

18

both, there is no constructive discharge claim.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Without

But for a constructive

20

discharge claim to succeed you have to point to a

21

discriminatory or an unlawful act.

22

MR. WOLFMAN:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

It is true that ­­

this anyway.
MR. WOLFMAN:

component.

precipitating conduct and the resignation; both elements

4

must be present for there to be constructive discharge.

5

There is no question that there are going to

But ­­ but let's assume for a second that

6

the ­­ that the ­­ the matter alleged to be

7

discriminatory is ambiguous in some sense.

8

court should just go to its time­honored default rule.

9

Default rule is that the cause of action must be fully

10
11

Then the

formed before the limitations period is triggered.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course.

That's ­­ that

12

rule is adopted for statutes that do not have a

13

conciliation provision.

14

provision once the employee has quit?

15

MR. WOLFMAN:

What use is the conciliation

I ­­ I think not, Your Honor.

16

The conciliation process always anticipates that the

17

claim will have occurred; that the acts giving rise to

18

the claim, including all the elements, have occurred

19

before conciliation ­­

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's fine, but the

21

employer can make it up, you know.

22

bring the employer and the employee together.

23

MR. WOLFMAN:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. WOLFMAN:

It's ­­ they try to

That is true.
Right?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. WOLFMAN:

But he's quit.

He's gone.

What conciliation can there

Your Honor, that is true for

5

any of the acts that could be brought prior to the

6

45­day trigger.

7

exactly the scenario you're suggesting, a termination

8

which, after all, is the analogue to the constructive

9

discharge.

10

For instance, a termination would fit

That claim cannot be brought into the

conciliation process until it exists.

11

So it's just the first component of the

12

process ­­ what you're referring to, Your Honor, as

13

conciliation ­­ moves quickly into a more adversarial

14

stages, and all of those stages presuppose that there is

15

a cause of action that exists, or a claim that exists.

16

And again, that's quite consistent with this

17

Court's default rule that ­­ that the limitations period

18

is ­­ is not triggered until the claim is fully formed.

19

And that's perfectly consistent with all of this Court's

20

Title VII timeliness cases.

21

If you look at, for instance, Evans, if you

22

look at Ricks.

23

of action, and that's why the limitations period was

24

triggered, because the limitations period was triggered

25

by the denial of tenure.

At Ricks there was a fully formed cause

MR. WOLFMAN:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.

I think ­­
So that that discharge

13

itself is discriminatory because it ­­ the employer has

14

proceeded in a pattern that has led you to that

15

decision?

16

MR. WOLFMAN:

That's exactly right.

And I

17

did not mean to be retreating from that position at all.

18

That's the two elements of the claim.

MR. WOLFMAN:

Now he'd still have a claim

20

possible, but again, that would ­­ that would be the

So, for instance, let's assume for a second

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If ­­ you might be pulled in

two different directions here but you don't have to

case; isn't that right?

In other words, one could say, yes, if you

had discriminatory acts language, that might point to

11

the last predicate discriminatory act as opposed to the

12

resignation, it might or it might not, but here that

13

language doesn't exist.

So you don't have not to go

to that ­­
MR. WOLFMAN:

I think that is true, that we

have argued this in two alternative ways.

25

that the cause of action is not complete until there's a

Alderson Reporting Company

One is simply

Official

11
1

resignation.

2

even if it were not clear, the default rule kicks in and

3

we win.

4

And we think the regulation is clear, but

But there's no question also that one of the

5

premises of the constructive discharge, constructive

6

eviction, constructive termination as in the Mac's Shell

7

case, there is no question that there is this idea that

8

when the relationship is ended, that is imputed to the

9

employer.

Some courts have focused more on that

10

rationale, and others have focused more on our principal

11

rationale, which is simply that the cause of action is

12

not complete until the resignation occurs.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why doesn't that mean

14

that it's within the employee's ability to stretch out

15

the time that he has?

16

this discrimination and the employee stays on the job,

17

and then sometime down the road decides to quit.

18

Plus there could have been all

Well, I think ­­ I think that

is a concern in theory but not in practice.

22

brought, and amicus cites no claims of that nature.

within the hands of the plaintiff.

written, the limitations period was written, and so be

5

it.

6

And the Court said,

And the Court also added that the plaintiff

7

would have incentives to bring the claim as soon as

possible, and that would, of course, be true here.

It ­­ if in fact the person could no longer take it,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it true that outside

4

of the area of constructive discharge ­­ and maybe

5

constructive discharge is different, and I think that's

6

really the thrust of your argument.

7

situation there must be an act of intentional

8

discrimination within the limitations period.

9

MR. WOLFMAN:

But outside of that

Well, that is likely correct,

10

if by that you are rejecting the notion ­­ again, in my

11

discussion with Justice Sotomayor ­­ that the

12

resignation is imputed to the employer.

13

that is the case, Your Honor ­­

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

that there's ­­ because there's this imputation, it's

16

different for constructive discharge.

MR. WOLFMAN:

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.
But my ­­ my question is

19

outside of that context, under Evans and Ricks and

20

Morgan and Ledbetter, there must be an act of

21

intentional discrimination within the limitations

22

period.

of those cases, the trigger date was when the claim

we're asking for here.

And let me again extend my answer to you,

5

Justice Alito, which it is true that constructive

6

discharge could be unique in the sense you're suggesting

7

in the Title VII case, in the Title VII area.

remember that constructive eviction, constructive

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

11

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

12
13

Thank you, counsel.

MR. GANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

We agree with petitioner that the period for

15

initiating administrative consideration of a

16

constructive­discharge claim should begin when the

17

employee gives notice of resignation and not when the

18

employer commits the last act which might or might not

19

lead to that resignation.

20

And if I can turn to the colloquy that the

21

Chief Justice and Justice Scalia were just having with

22

my friend, we think that one of the virtues of this rule

23

is that it ­­ it leads to the same result in both cases

24

of actual termination and cases of constructive

25

termination.

question presents itself in the non­Federal sector where

the statute, as has already been discussed, refers to

when the allegedly unlawful employment practice

The same question is going to present

And the EEOC has construed this portion of

Alderson Reporting Company

And the rule that we're asking for is this

2

Court's rule from Ricks.

3

This rule about being when definitive notice has ­­

4

is ­­ is given for a termination, Justice Scalia, you

5

were saying that when somebody says I quit, my last day

6

of work is three months from now, therefore, he hasn't

7

actually quit, that's Ricks.

8
9

It's the exact same rule.

The Court concluded that when the employer
there said you have been denied tenure, here is your

10

terminal contract, you will be working here for only one

11

more year, that the relevant date was the date on which

12

the operative decision had been made and it had been

13

communicated to the employee.

rule should be the same for cases of actual discharge ­­

3

MR. GANNON:

You ­­ you

We're trying to say that we

4

think that the same rule should apply to actual and

5

constructive discharges, and ­­ and it is a rule that is

6

date of notification rather than date of separation.

7

And that's the rule that everybody applies on the

8

termination side; it's the rule that most of the courts

9

of appeals have applied in the ­­ in the discharge side.

10

In the context of terminations, only

11

Justice Stevens suggested we should be using the actual

12

date of separation ­­

the decision that you want to apply the same rule across

reason you would do that is precisely because, as the

or an actual discharge.

7

Everybody knows when the employer says,

today, same thing when the employee says I'm giving my

Well, we think that the reason

19

that this counts as being an act that should be imputed

to the employer is because it is forced by the

21

circumstances.

And we think that the doctrine itself is

self­limiting.

the employer does to him, and then actually say I can't

Within 45 days after ­­

After the date ­­

MR. GANNON:

22

Just as, like ­­ as I was saying before, just as if it

23

were when the employer said, you're fired, your last day

24

of work is two weeks from today.

25

That's the rule from Ricks.

The clock is ticking.

We think it should be the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

same rule here, and we think that the reason why this is

2

called a constructive discharge is ­­ is right there in

3

the phrase is ­­ is pregnant with the idea that this is

4

an action that is being imputed to the employer.

5

And so although it is true that, unlike the

6

regular ­­ the other claim of discrimination that

7

Justice Kennedy was mentioning before in Ricks, although

8

the employer has not actually done something necessarily

9

during the limitations period, the new act of

10

discrimination that we think is relevant here is the act

11

of the employee, and it's one that it's called a

12

constructive discharge precisely because it is not

13

actually a discharge.

14

employee that is a resignation, but it is treated in law

There was not reached by

MR. GANNON:

This was reached by the

district court.

It was an alternative holding by the

17

district court.

The Petitioner did not appeal that

18

alternative holding.

19

the court was just considering the antecedent question

20

of whether we should only look to the act of the

21

employer or also the act of the employee.

22

And so in the court of appeals,

And so this factual question didn't actually

23

come up before the court of appeals.

24

statement of facts in our court of appeals brief that

25

the agreement included his ­­ the settlement agreement

Alderson Reporting Company

We noted in the

Official

35
1

included his agreement to retire, but otherwise we did

2

take the case on his premise, and the court of appeals

3

did not address this.

4

So we do think that it would be appropriate

5

for the Court here, if it agrees with us, if this

6

agreement is sufficiently clear, to say that Petitioner

7

will lose on the facts of this case.

8

If you want to remand and have the court of

9

appeals consider whether the district court was correct

10

in reaching that, that would also be appropriate.

11

we think that this wouldn't be that different from what

12

the Court did in Irwin where in Irwin the Court said,

13

well, the court of appeals was wrong about finding that

14

there was no possibility of equitable tolling;

15

nevertheless, there is no way he will ever satisfy

16

equitable tolling on the facts of this case, so he

17

loses.

18

But

And I do think that one final thing I would

19

like to say is that the Court should be able to take

20

some comfort from the real­world evidence that we have.

21

It's not much.

22

five circuits that have adopted a version of the notice

23

of resignation rule between 1987 and 2000 that indicates

24

that employers are being besieged with stale

those concerns.

And so we think that it's doesn't present

be very much time between these two dates, and therefore

19

it usually isn't going to be that dispositive.

20

In this case, we think that the things

21

happened on the same day.

22

approach, he had some weeks to make his decision.

23

the reason why he wasn't prejudiced by being able to

24

take some weeks to make his decision is precisely

25

because he was using annual leave, he wasn't suffering

Even under Petitioner's

Alderson Reporting Company

But

the consequences of a hostile work environment, he

2

hadn't taken the pay cut, he hadn't had to move 400

3

miles away, and so this was an unusual case where he

4

would have been able to take that much time.

5

And so it looks like, as in ­­ in

6

practicality's sake, that ­­ that it hasn't made a big

7

difference.

8

for the Court to say this is effectively the Ricks rule.

It should apply to both cases of actual and cases of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE M.A. CARROLL
AS COURT­APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE
IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW
MS. CARROLL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We agree that the Ricks rule should apply

21

here as it does to any other kind of claim under Title

22

VII, and like any other kind of claim under Title VII, a

23

constructive discharge claim has to challenge actionable

24

conduct by the employer.

25

In applying the EEOC's regulation here, we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

have to ask, what was that actionable conduct, that

2

matter alleged to be discriminatory, and when did it

3

occur.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, you just sort of made

5

those two synonymous.

6

synonymous.

7

particular discriminatory conduct that's the predicate

8

for the claim.

9

But they don't have to be

A matter might mean the claim, not the

MS. CARROLL:

Justice Kagan, I think that

10

the EEOC has, by equating the Federal sector provision

11

with the private sector provision, has suggested that

12

both of these provisions do focus on the alleged

13

unlawful employment practice.

14

promulgated this rule in its current form, it explained

15

that this rule, quote, continued the rule that had

16

applied under the prior version which used the language

17

alleged discriminatory event.

18

In addition when the EEOC

So I don't think the inclusion of the word

19

"matter" by itself makes a difference.

20

doesn't just say matter.

21

discriminatory, and we think that has to be read as a

22

whole to clearly focus on what is it that is the target

23

of the claim.

24
25

After all, it

It says matter alleged to be

And that language is ­­ it does not become
ambiguous just because it might be challenging to apply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

it in a particular fact pattern.

2

decision in Morgan is an excellent example of that where

3

the Court said we have a clear rule that requires us to

4

identify what was the alleged unlawful employment

5

practice and when did it occur, and that's the analysis

6

here.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think this Court's

I mean, this is an unusual

8

kind of claim, and it's an unusual kind of claim because

9

there are predicate acts and then there is also a

10

resignation which clearly has to occur before the suit

11

can be brought.

12

composite set of things that has to go on before a suit,

13

it seems to me that it's at least approaching the kind

14

of possible ambiguous ­­ ambiguous stage to say, yeah,

15

that's a matter, that's a practice that both of those

16

things have to be part of it.

17

And when there is this, you know, this

MS. CARROLL:

I think that that's difficult

18

to reconcile with how Morgan treated the word

19

"practice."

20

explained in a case like Graham County, for instance,

21

the kind of ambiguity that triggers resort to a default

22

accrual rule is ambiguity in the literal text of the

23

provision.

24

limitations period even applied and the Court said,

25

literal text is ambiguous, there are clues that point in

Always bearing in mind, as the Court has

There it was unclear whether a particular

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

one direction, we think this default rule points in the

2

same direction.

3

But the Court hasn't applied that background

4

rule to override language that's ­­ that otherwise

5

clearly calls for an analysis of, in this case, what is

6

it that the plaintiff alleged to be discriminatory.

7

Here, Mr. Green alleged a discrete act of

8

retaliation that he says occurred in December of 2009.

9

He alleges no repeated or cumulative acts of

10

discrimination subsequent to that date and so ­­

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about that he hasn't

12

got a claim?

13

with a claim for constructive discharge until you've

14

said I'm discharged.

15

the time runs from a time when he does not yet have a

16

ripe claim.

17

He can't even ­­ you can't come to court

So he ­­ you're suggesting that

MS. CARROLL:

Well, we does not have a ripe

18

claim for constructive discharge.

19

claim for discrimination or retaliation to challenge the

20

underlying predicate acts, and in this position ­­

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

He would have a ripe

But then are you saying

22

that constructive discharge will ­­ will lead to a cause

23

of action only when it is so close to the precipitating

24

event that they are almost contemporaneous?

25

MS. CARROLL:

I'm not 100 percent sure I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

followed the question, but let me ­­

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

When, under your view,

3

when is there a constructive discharge that itself leads

4

to triggering the statute of limitations?

5

MS. CARROLL:

I think in a constructive

6

discharge case ­­ and to be clear, that label can be

7

applied to a range of different fact patterns ­­ it will

8

often be the case that the predicate conduct that

9

precipitates the resignation is itself alleged to be

10

discriminatory.

11

where there was an ongoing pattern of harassing

12

behavior.

13

work environment had occurred leading up to and indeed

14

on I believe the very day of the resignation.

15

think it is, as Your Honor suggests, not going to matter

16

at all which rule the Court were to adopt in this case.

17
18
19

Take the facts of Suders, for instance,

Individual acts contributing to that hostile

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There, I

They're almost

contemporaneous.
MS. CARROLL:

They would be contemporaneous.

20

But in a case like this, it's much clearer to see the

21

conceptual distinction between Mr. Green's own

22

individual independent decision to resign and his

23

employer's predicate discriminatory conduct.

24

Suders, the Court made very clear that those were two

25

distinct components of a constructive­discharge claim.

Alderson Reporting Company

And in

Official

42
1

And I think, you know, the Petitioner and

2

the government's position asks the Court to extend the

3

legal fiction that equates constructive discharge.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the matter complained

5

of here is a constructive discharge.

6

many the matter complained of is negligent behavior

7

leading to an injury.

8

statute of limitations doesn't begin to run until there

9

is harm.

10
11
12

In a tort suit or

I take it in the tort suit the

MS. CARROLL:

I think that's generally true

of tort suits ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

If that's

13

generally true in a tort suit, and my guess is in a

14

contract suit for breach of contract, if the contracting

15

party sent the ships out and you knew that it wouldn't

16

be delivered, it's not actionable until it isn't

17

delivered and I guess there are ways around that, but my

18

point is generally in the law where the matter

19

complained of is a certain kind of incident in the

20

world, negligence leading to harm, action of a

21

discriminatory, et cetera, nature that leads to a

22

discharge, normally the statute of limitations begins to

23

run when the harm occurs.

24

Now why should it be any different here?

25

MS. CARROLL:

In this case, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

discrimination, the retaliation I should say, that was

2

challenged was the forcing ­­ forcing of Mr. Green into

3

the settlement agreement in December.

4

that was retaliatory and he was harmed by that at that

5

time, and he could have promptly initiated counseling on

6

that complaint.

7

He alleges that

Now, it is true that, as a consequence of

8

that discriminatory retaliatory conduct, the stakes got

9

higher for him at a later point when he decided ­­

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course, he could have,

11

but we're talking about only the constructive discharge

12

part.

13

at once, or at least allegedly bad.

I mean, sometimes defendants do seven bad things

14

MS. CARROLL:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct, but ­­
And we're only talking

16

about one of them, the one that we're talking about is

17

the constructive­discharge claim.

18

So I go back to my question about

19

negligence, because that was the first course I took in

20

law school so I remember that, but the ­­ the fact is

21

why should we treat this any differently?

22

MS. CARROLL:

So, in general, we don't this

23

should be analyzed any differently than any other kind

24

of claim, which is that we have to identify what is the

25

alleged unlawful practice and when did it occur.

Alderson Reporting Company

Why is

Official

44
1

that?

Because ­­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because you have to, as you

3

said, in the a tort case it's not just that the person

4

behaved negligently, but that negligence had to result

5

in a harm.

6

MS. CARROLL:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And ­­
So I'm just ­­ that's the

8

only simpleminded analogy I'm drawing and I wonder why

9

it doesn't work.

10

MS. CARROLL:

I think it does work because

11

in this case there was retaliation alleged in December

12

that harmed Mr. Green at that time.

13

more painful consequence, which under Ricks does not

14

trigger a new construct ­­ a new statute of limitations.

15

But I want to go back ­­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

He later suffered a

Suppose there was evidence

17

that the employer had a continuing intent to force

18

Mr. Green's resignation.

19

Mr. Green is causing trouble for us by charging us with

20

discrimination, we're going to do A, B, C, D and E to

21

force him to retire.

22

there is another email that says, Hallelujah, we've

23

achieved our objective, he's retired.

So you've got emails that say,

And then on the day when he quits

24

Now when would it run in that situation?

25

MS. CARROLL:

I think if ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Wouldn't it run from the

2

date of discharge because there would be an intent at ­­

3

as of that date?

4

MS. CARROLL:

But if I'm understanding the

5

hypothetical correctly, that sounds to me like a case

6

that would be analyzed under the Court's decision in

7

Morgan, where you have an environment of hostility that

8

is composed of many individual acts, some of which might

9

not be independently actionable in and of themselves,

certain point, and then 45 days, 50 days pass and the

14

employee resigns, but the employer has all along had the

15

intention of forcing the resignation.

16

the resignation the employer intends to cause a

17

discharge for discriminatory reason.

18

MS. CARROLL:

There are all these acts up to a

So on the date of

I still think Morgan answers

19

that question because Morgan says there has to be an act

20

contributing to the hostile work environment that occurs

21

within the 40 ­­ within the charging period.

22

the exact same analysis whether on the 46th day the

23

employee decides that's it, I quit, or if he simply

24

decides that's it, I'm finally going to speak up about

25

this hostile work environment that's being been going

Alderson Reporting Company

And that's

Official

46
1

on.

It has nothing to do with constructive discharge.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the ­­ now, I'm

3

getting this more clearly because your response to my

4

question, which is now relevant to this too, is, look,

5

the plaintiff was hurt on the very day that last act was

6

performed, indeed he suffered because he saw the act

7

being performed, and that was one of the things that led

8

him later to quit.

9

So let's count that as the injury.

And

10

let's count the whole thing complete as of that time.

11

That's basically the argument for your side, I think.

12

And now the argument against you is that's

13

going to be a nightmare.

14

a whole range of acts, a whole series in many cases and

15

will then, in order to run the statute of limitations,

16

have to get into the question of which of those acts ­­

17

maybe there were some he didn't know about ­­ which of

18

those acts actually did produce harm and which did not.

19

And he just really won't know when to bring his lawsuit

20

as compared with the comparatively simple thing:

21

quits.

22

MS. CARROLL:

Because there will be in fact

He

Right, I understand that

23

contention, but I think that the so­called difficulty is

24

no different than the difficulty, so­called, that would

25

arise in a hostile work environment case where there was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

no resignation.

You would still have to ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MS. CARROLL:

Yes, that's true.

­­ figure out what ­­ were

4

there acts within the 45­day period that contributed to

5

the environment.

6

some facts, but that's a result of this Court's decision

7

in Morgan, again, nothing to do with constructive

8

discharge.

9

Maybe that's going to be difficult on

Now, with respect to ­­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There's something more than

11

just simplicity, which is, you know, suppose you had a

12

case where somebody is first demoted and then somebody

13

is fired.

14

suffered the injury then, it just raised the stakes.

15

You would say, no, there's two independent things and

16

now he can bring a termination claim.

You would never say, oh, he was demoted.

17

MS. CARROLL:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

He

That's right.
And the power of the

19

constructive­discharge claim is to say the exact same

20

thing really has happened here, that once you lose the

21

job, it's more than the stakes have been raised.

22

that there is a separate injury that then becomes

23

legally actionable.

24
25

MS. CARROLL:

It's

Well, the analysis when there

is a demotion followed by a termination is not simply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

that there's been a second separate injury, but that

2

there's been a second separate violation of Title VII by

3

the employer.

4

employment action triggering a fresh limitations period.

5

That's why it is a discrete unlawful

In constructive discharge, you know, the

6

analysis that the second separate event, the employee's

7

decision to resign is itself the actionable thing, that

8

is the analysis that the court of appeals had applied in

9

Suders.

In Suders the question was:

Do we treat

10

constructive discharge as a tangible employment action

11

for purposes of determining vicarious liability.

12

Third Circuit said, well, yes, we treat these as

13

equivalents for all intents and purposes, so naturally,

14

when there's a constructive discharge, that means

15

there's been a tangible employment action.

16

The

This Court rejected that analysis and said,

17

no, the legal fiction does not extend that far.

18

sure, the Court says, we treat those two the same for

19

remedial purposes in the sense that an employee who has

20

been constructively discharged can recover for that to

21

the same degree and for the same extent as if he or she

22

had been actually discharged.

23

To be

That makes sense because you have this

24

background duty to mitigate and, in the circumstance of

25

a constructive discharge, we don't think the employee

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

should be tagged with the consequences of having, you

2

know, so­called failed to mitigate damages.

3

that's ­­ that's the purpose of the legal fiction ­­

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But

But if we're going to say,

5

yes, these are different and for some purposes we're

6

going to look to the fiction and for other purposes

7

we're not going to look to the fiction, it seems to me

8

as though here it makes sense to take account of the

9

fiction in the sense that the person cannot bring a

10

claim until the resignation has happened.

11

So that's the kind of paradigmatic case in

12

which, boy, there is something really powerful pushing

13

that, yes, you can ­­ you should recognize the

14

constructive discharge as a discharge in this case.

15

MS. CARROLL:

But the limitations period

16

here does not run from the accrual of the claim, it runs

17

from the time of the matter alleged to be

18

discriminatory, the unlawful employment action.

19

this Court explained in Suders, the constructive

20

discharge entails both predicate discrimination ­­ and

21

we do think it has to be independently actionable.

22

think the Court recognized that when it said in Suders

23

that for Ms. Suders to prove her hostile work

24

environment claim was quoting necessary predicate to her

25

constructive discharge claim, and that's also the

Alderson Reporting Company

And as

We

2

be predicate, unlawful conduct by the employer and a

3

subsequent decision by the employee to resign.

4

There has to

When you have a provision that singles out

5

as the start of the limitations period one of those two

6

components, then the fact that the claim hasn't accrued

7

yet is not something that the Court can rely on to

8

override that clear language.

9

decision in Pillsbury is a really excellent example of

I think this Court's

10

that, where under the Longshoremen's Act, there was a

11

provision that ran from the time of injury.

12

plaintiffs pointed out, well, that we can't actually

13

recover compensation for our injury until a disability

14

has manifested, so we should say that we should

15

interpret injury to mean disability.

16

said, well, no.

17

the limitation period before the claim can accrue, but

18

the language says what it says.

19

And the

And the Court

I mean, it's true that that will run

For what it's worth here, I don't think that

20

this reading is actually going to cut off claims except

21

in cases of, you know, real lack of diligence, because

22

here, it's not the case that there's no claim available

23

after the initial act of discrimination by the employer,

24

there is a claim available, the employee can initiate

25

counseling on that, and as a matter of the conciliation

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

policy, he or she ought to do that promptly in order to

2

bring about the best chance of a prompt and informal

3

reconciliation.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The language we're focusing

5

on here is the language of a regulation.

6

language does that regulation implement?

7

MS. CARROLL:

What statutory

The cause of action for

8

Federal employees in 2000e­16(c), if I have that right,

9

requires that, it extends a cause of action to Federal

10

employees who have been aggrieved by the final decision

11

of an agency that has been produced through this

12

administrative process that is all a design of ­­ of

13

EEOC regulations.

14

So there, the ­­ unlike in the private

15

sector provision, the charging period here is purely a

16

creature of the regulation.

17

in the statute on the Federal sector side is only the

18

time limit for bringing the lawsuit once you have been

19

aggrieved by the final agency decision.

20

The time limit that exists

environment or discrimination, but quitting your job is

a very big deal.

I think it's going to be a

Alderson Reporting Company

that's going to be, and just because you can't take it

anymore doesn't mean that you could quit work right

away.

5

you to quit in order to be able to raise and seek

resolution.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, sure, it doesn't

require you to quit, it just requires you to tell your

boss, you know, I can't take this anymore.

And now I've

10

got to conciliate with you, but, you know, it creates

11

complications in the workforce if you raise that type of

12

issue.

13

MS. CARROLL:

It can.

I mean, to be clear,

14

the EEOC regulations require that this must be all done

15

anonymously until the complaining employee says

16

actually, please go ahead and tell my employer so that

17

we can try to pursue alternative ­­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suspect most

19

employers could figure out who is complaining in these

20

types of situations.

21

MS. CARROLL:

Well, be that as it may, I

22

think the policy underlying this provision is the

23

recognition that the purpose of all of this is to try to

24

prevent discrimination and to correct it as soon as it

25

has occurred.

It is unquestionably a very short

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

provision, and the Court recognized in Morgan that this

2

very short provision exists because of the recognition

3

that we want these sorts of alleged discriminatory,

4

retaliatory circumstances to be addressed right away.

5

There are safeguards built in.

6

probably unique among statutes of limitations that I

know of, actually mandates that it be extended if, for

example, the employee didn't know about the time limit

case, we think it asks the Court or the agency to engage

in precisely the same inquiry that it would have to do

discharge.

what is the alleged violation of the statute.

conduct by the employer, namely, a severe and pervasive

change in the terms and conditions of her employment

amounting to a hostile work environment, and she had to

meet the constructive discharge standard.

23

Court's intent in saying so had been to equate

constructive discharge with actual discharge for all

intents and purposes, then I don't see how the Court

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. WOLFMAN:

Your Honor, if I might, I

8

would like to begin where we ended.

9

and then recognized a claim for constructive discharge,

Suders considered

10

what we would call in the old days a cause of action.

11

At pages 142 and 143, the Court said it was considering

12

whether a claim for constructive discharge lies under

13

Title VII.

14

And then it ­­ it holds, we agree with the

15

lower courts and the EEOC that Title VII encompasses

16

employer liability for constructive discharge.

17

simply damage enhancing, but liability for constructive

18

discharge.

Not

19

I do want to turn to, Mr. Chief Justice,

20

your question about the government's position on the

21

date of resignation.

22

the Tenth Circuit did not address this.

23

Appendix 2A, here's what the Tenth Circuit said:

24

shortly after being put on leave he signed a settlement

25

agreement under which he would choose either to retire

It is not entirely correct that

or to work in a position that paid much less and was

2

about 300 miles away.

the ­­

5

That was the premise on which

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

That's true,

and that's why I thought ­­

6

MR. WOLFMAN:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
­­ that was an open

8

question.

9

fact the district court said that you chose to retire

But the government, Mr. Gannon says that in

10

on ­­ in December, and you didn't appeal that finding by

11

the district court.

12

MR. WOLFMAN:

That is not correct.

The

13

district court was of two minds on the question.

14

point it ­­ it indicated that his ­­ his agreement was a

15

resignation.

16

reply brief ­­ the district court said the exact

17

opposite.

18

district court opinion, its legal ruling is not premised

19

on that ­­ what the government is saying is a finding.

20

Now, let me also say that the EEO decision

At one

At another point ­­ and this is in other

It said what the Tenth Circuit said.

And the

21

in this case, that is the Postal Service itself said ­­

22

this is at the Joint Appendix 23 ­­ a fair reading of

23

the agreement reveals that he was given the choice to

24

retire or to report to a new job, and was allowed to

25

continue his career.

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is your response to

3

her ­­ I think she's saying in most of these cases there

4

is a hostile work environment.

5

work environment you have 45 days from the last act, and

6

so what we should do is look at this injury as simply

7

one more injury caused by a hostile work environment.

8

And just as you don't look at the date of injury there,

9

you look to the environment, et cetera, we so do the

10

same thing here.

Where there is a hostile

It's simpler, et cetera.

11

MR. WOLFMAN:

to that, Justice Breyer.

13

challenge the premise of the seven illustrative cases

14

cited in Suders, illustrative for constructive

15

discharge.

16

discharges, untethered to any other claim; that's

17

number 1.

18

Right.

There are two answers

First of all, I do want to

Three of them were standalone constructive

Number 2, even if you have what this Court

19

in Suders called a subset of constructive discharge

20

cases, that is one arising out of a hostile work

21

environment, they are still distinct claims.

22

really the point of Suders.

23

they're separately actionable, and we know they're

24

separately actionable because the constructive­discharge

25

claim is not actionable until resignation.

That's

They're distinct claims,
