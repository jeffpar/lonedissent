ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. DVORETZKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

Congress amended the discharge bar in 1978

12

to add actual fraud as an additional ground for barring

13

discharge.

14

interpretation is the only one that does so.

15

That amendment must be given meaning.

Our

Consistent with the common­law understanding

16

that Congress codified, "actual fraud" is a term of art

17

that includes a recipient's knowing participation in a

18

deliberate fraudulent transfer.

19

Circuit's holding that actual fraud invariably requires

20

a misrepresentation makes Congress's amendment

21

superfluous because it equates actual fraud with the

22

preexisting terms, "false pretenses" and "false

23

representation."

By contrast, the Fifth

24

Respondent's interpretation is even worse.

25

It merely restates a preexisting scienter requirement.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

And in any event, Congress could not plausibly have

2

added "or actual fraud" to the discharge bar in order to

3

modify the previous terms to mean intentional false

4

pretenses or an intentional false representation.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We would need to

assets from Chrysalis to his other entities in order to

Second of all, we would have to show that he

perpetrated that fraud for his own personal benefit,

25

which is what would then allow us to pierce the

corporate veil and hold him personally liable for the

2

fraud that he committed.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Are you piercing the

4

corporate veil as to the first company, or as to the

5

transferee companies?

6

MR. DVORETZKY:

We are piercing the ­­ it

7

could be either, but ­­ but I think we are piercing the

8

veil as to the transferee companies because we're

9

pursuing this on a recipient theory.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

Because ­­ because I

11

understood your whole brief to be pursuing this on a

12

recipient theory.

13

MR. DVORETZKY: Correct.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And your brief, you know,

15

makes some sense as that.

16

to your complaint, it suggests that the veil­piercing

17

actually was attempted as to the transferor company,

18

which doesn't do you any good under your theory.

19

But then when you look back

To the extent that

10

We're talking about Creditor C, who was a creditor of

She is not ­­ she is not trying to

12

MR. DVORETZKY:

True.

But if she is

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. DVORETZKY:

That understanding is

5

consistent with the common­law understanding of actual

an additional ground for discharge.

13

So it was expanding the scope of the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It does make the language

14

"false pretenses" or "false representations" completely

15

superfluous, yes?

16

MR. DVORETZKY:

It does, but the key point

17

here is that it also expands upon that language, whereas

18

the Fifth Circuit's ­­ the Fifth Circuit's

19

interpretation also makes "false pretenses" and "false

20

representations" superfluous without giving Congress's

21

amendment any additional work to do.

22

So too for Respondent's interpretation,

23

which first of all, merely restates a preexisting

24

scienter requirement, so it gives the amendment no

25

additional broadening scope.

And second of all, is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

grammatically indefensible because "or actual fraud" is

2

not a narrowing phrase that modifies what comes before

3

it.

4

Congress could perhaps have simply replaced

5

"false pretenses" and "false representations" with "or

6

actual fraud," but that might have led to an unwarranted

7

negative inference by the deletion of terms "false

8

pretenses" and "false representations" that had been in

9

the statute for a very long time.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you ­­ you would like

11

the Court to ­­ to hold that "actual fraud" means

12

something other than false pretenses or

13

misrepresentation; that it's ­­ it's a broader term, it

14

includes things that were not already included, period,

15

and then whatever other issues would be ­­ to be

16

resolved on remand?

17
18
19

MR. DVORETZKY:

That's ­­ that's correct,

Justice Ginsburg.
With respect to Respondent's interpretation,

20

first of all, as we established in our reply brief,

21

false pretenses and false representations already

22

required intentional fraud.

23

those terms in the discharge bar before 1978 to apply to

24

innocent conduct, and so there is no basis to think that

25

when Congress added "or actual fraud" to the statute, it

No court had interpreted

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12

2

was simply restating an existing rule.
This Court has, in the past, refused to

3

infer ­­ to interpret congressional amendments simply to

4

restate existing rules when there is a plausible ­­

5

indeed, settled, in light of the common­law ­­

6

understanding, like the one that we offer that gives the

7

amendment an additional function.

8
9

The other problem with Respondent's
interpretation, of course, is grammatical.

"Or" is a

10

disjunctive term that expands on what comes before; it's

11

not a term that limits what comes before.

12

And moreover, "actual fraud" is a noun

13

phrase that in ­­ that represents both conduct; fraud,

14

and the way in which it is carried out, intentionally.

15

It's not simply a mens rea.

16
17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why did Congress

take the term "fraud" out of the Bankruptcy Act in 1903?

18

MR. DVORETZKY:

19

doesn't tell us why Congress did that.

20

is that when Congress took out that term in 1903, at

21

least one legislator expressed concern that this was

22

leaving a category of frauds outside the discharge bar,

23

and that that was a mistake because the ­­ the purpose

occurred in this case.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Murphy points out that

15

there are lots of other provisions in 523(a), which have

16

a lot of overlap on this provision on your reading.

17

then also the fraudulent conveyance provisions, if you

18

would talk a little bit about those.

19
20
21

MR. DVORETZKY:

Sure.

And

Let me address the

fraudulent conveyance provisions first.
The fraudulent conveyance provisions are

22

targeted at the transferor, not the transferee.

23

our reading of 523 complements those provisions rather

24

than conflicts with them.

25

And so

727 provides that there is no discharge at

Alderson Reporting Company

2

creditors within a year of the bankruptcy filing.

3

548 allows the trustee to pursue claims for

4

transfers within two years, but nothing about our

reading of 523 is inconsistent with that.

6

provides that, in addition to those things, creditors

7

may pursue fraud claims where there is a fraudulent

The Court of Appeals erred in holding that

2

Section 523(a)(2)(A) always requires proof of an

4

fraud.

5

the government are right about our interpretation of

6

Section 523(a)(2)(A).

There are three main reasons why Petitioner and

7

The first is that this Court has said many

8

times that when Congress uses a term that has an

9

established common­law meaning, courts should give it

10

that meaning when it's used in a statute.

11

For centuries, the term "actual fraud" has

12

been used at common law to refer to schemes that are

13

in ­­ that ­­ that where property is transferred with

14

the ­­ with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a

Code, that ­­ that dishonors creditors ­­ excuse me ­­

25

Now, Respondent offers a competing textual

interpretation of the term ­­ of the phrase "or actual

meaning to the word "obtained," if obtained doesn't mean

12

But under our view, the word "obtained"

13

actually does two things:

14

the work that this Court described it as doing in

15

Cohen v. de la Cruz, which is it requires a causal

16

connection between the fraudulent act and the debtor's

17

acquisition of ­­ or possession of the property or

18

money.

19

The first thing it does is

But the second thing it does, in the

20

fraudulent transfer context, specifically, is it sort of

21

screens out the innocent recipient of a fraudulent

transfer.

argue ­­ arguably, that could have brought in an

activity.

And so it really just gets at

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the part ­­ you see,

8

it's still gnawing at me is I wish you had read this

9

case.

Because ­­ because when we went through it,

10

this ­­ this sentence, fraudulent ­­ and I wouldn't

11

raise this, except the only example other than the

12

misrepresentation that you've come up with is the

13

fraudulent conveyance.

14

And what I said, after reading all ­­

15

"fraudulent conveyance law permits creditors to recover

16

money that a debtor has disposed of in a manner

17

similar," and then I described three paradigm cases.

18

All right.

So what they're thinking of is a

19

transferor has creditors.

20

going into bankruptcy, but he knew he was likely to be

21

insolvent, the transferor transfers money to his friends

22

rather than the creditors, to a place that it's hard to

23

get at, you know, to somebody who is going to ­­ all

24

right.

25

And what he did well before

Now, looking at this statute, it seems to me

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

that the person whose debt is going to survive

2

bankruptcy is not the transferor, because normally,

3

fraudulent conveyance law permitted his bankruptcy judge

4

to claw back the money.

5

talking about.

6

you're saying here, the transferee's participation in

7

the transferor's effort to defraud his creditor is

8

something that also survives.

9

But that's not what you're

You're talking about the transferee, and

And at that point I ask, of all the bad

10

things that people can do that might survive, why in

11

heaven's name do they pick on this one in respect to the

12

transferee?

13

robbed a bank.

14

things that might survive, and ­­ and don't.

I mean, after all, maybe the transferee
I mean, there are all kinds of bad

15

So was ­­ so am I ­­ something's wrong with

16

my analysis, as you understand it, and that's what I've

17

got to get into my head.

18

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, see, there are all

19

kinds of debts that ­­ that do survive a bankruptcy,

20

including the debt for the transferor.

21
22
23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

If I got what I'm

talking about right, in terms of the debt.
MS. HARRINGTON:

Well ­­ so I think it is

24

important to realize there are two distinct debts:

25

There's the original debtor ­­ there's original debt

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

from the creditor to debtor one.

2

his property to a friend.

3

intent to defraud his creditor.

4

that intent, then the State law or some Federal law

5

gives the creditor a cause of action to go after the

6

recipient, to go after the friend.

7

Debtor one transfers

If the friend ­­ with the
If the friend shares

If that ­­ if that is successful, then

8

there's a new debt that's created from ­­ to the

9

creditor from the ­­ from the friend.

10
11

And that's the

debt we're talking about here.
With respect to why that wouldn't be

12

dischargeable, when ­­ if you're outside the time limits

13

that are covered by 548 or 727, the transferors

14

wouldn't ­­ it's because the transferee, the recipient,

15

is the person who ends up with the money or the

16

property, right?

17

So the second overarching purpose of the

18

Bankruptcy Code is to let creditors get their money back

19

when they can.

20

would have wanted to give maybe a stronger remedy ­­

And so it makes sense that Congress

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see.

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

­­ against the person who

23
24
25

actually has the stuff at the end of the day.
And so I think that's why our ­­ our reading
is consistent with the purpose of the ­­ of the Code in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22

general.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is ­­ is the veil

3

piercing that's going on here with respect to Chrysalis

4

as well, or just the companies to which Chrysalis's

5

assets were shifted?

6

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, you know, Mr.

7

Dvorestzky suggested that it's ­­ with ­­ with respect

8

to the recipients, recipient corporations, I think that

9

there ­­ there are many questions about the State law

10

cause of action that would need to be resolved on remand

11

if the Court were to reverse.

12

And I would just point out, on ­­ on the

13

final page of our brief, we have the text of the veil

14

piercing ­­ the Texas veil piercing, such that in ­­ in

15

order ­­ in order to prevail under that section, the

16

Petitioner is going to have to prove it says an actual

17

fraud for the direct personal benefit of the holder.

18

And so they're basically going to have to prove that

19

Mr. Ritz obtained money or property by actual fraud, in

20

order to prevail under the State law cause of action.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So how does that

22

work in the bankruptcy case?

23

discharged, but maybe it will turn out that it could

24

have been, depending on how ­­ how the State law claim

25

goes?

We say this debt can't be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

MS. HARRINGTON:

There's ­­ so what happens

2

is there's an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy ­­

3

in the larger bankruptcy proceeding itself.

4

instead of having parallel litigation in State court,

5

that action was stayed when the bankruptcy petition was

6

filed.

7

the bankruptcy court.

8
9

And so

And basically, all the action is transferred to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the bankruptcy

court will decide the question under State law?

10

MS. HARRINGTON:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes, yes.
Okay.

And the bankruptcy court

13

held that it ­­ it wasn't satisfied in this case,

14

because the bankruptcy court viewed those Texas laws as

15

requiring a misrepresentation, and also as 523(a)(2)(a)

16

is requiring misrepresentation.

17

And so I think there ­­ there are a lot of

18

things that would need to be sorted out about the State

19

law cause of action on remand.

20

I just want to say one last thing on

21

redundancy, if I could.

22

specific provisions in 523 that the Respondent suggests

23

are redundant.

24

suggests that ­­ and that's the ­­ that covers fraud in

25

a fiduciary capacity, such that if we're correct that

There's a couple of

One of them is 523(a)(4), and Respondent

24

anything that would be covered by (a)(4) would ­­ would

2

also be covered by 523(a)(2)(A).

3

But that's not correct, because 523(a)(4) is

4

not ­­ is not limited to situations in which money or

5

property was obtained by fraud.

6

fraud where a fiduciary caused one of your properties to

7

go to a third party.

8

covered by (a)(4) and wouldn't be covered by (a)(2)(a).

9

And so it could cover a

And ­­ and so that would be

And just in general, one last thing on

10

redundancy, I think Congress is trying to be

11

comprehensive in preventing dishonest debtors from

12

discharging their debts in bankruptcy.

13

used broad words like "fraud," and instead of sitting

14

down and thinking ­­ trying to think up every different

15

fraudulent scheme that people might come up with,

16

Congress just wanted to be comprehensive and say

17

"fraud," and it uses the same word "fraud" in multiple

18

places.

19

feature of the system, and not a flaw in the system.

And so Congress

That's going to create overlap.

20

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIN E. MURPHY

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

MS. MURPHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1
2

please the Court:
Section 523(a)(2) applies to a specific type

3

of debt, a debt for something with which the debtor has

4

fraudulently induced the creditor to part.

5

conclusion follows from the text of the statute for at

6

least three reasons:

7

expressly says that the debt has to be for something

8

obtained by the debtor's conduct; second, because the

9

statute explicitly and repeatedly talks about forms of

10

conduct where the debtor obtains something by inducing

11

detrimental reliance; and third, because the statute

12

makes clear on its face that it's the creditor whose

13

detrimental reliance has to be induced.

That

First, because the statute

14

Because Section 523(a)(2) applies only when

15

the debtor induces the creditor to part with something,

16

it does not apply to a debt for receiving money through

17

a fraudulent conveyance.

18

It may well be a form of actual fraud, but it's not a

19

form of fraud that gives rise to a debt that is subject

20

to exception from discharge under 523(a)(2).

21
22

That may be a form of fraud.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Congress have to write to cover a scheme like this?

23

MS. MURPHY:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Well, what ­­ what would

Well, I think ­­
You say it's not covered

under (a)(2).

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

MS. MURPHY:

Sure.

I think the most natural

2

way to do it would be by saying "fraudulent conveyance"

3

or "fraudulent transfer" or a "fraud that involves

4

intent to delay, defraud or ­­ or hinder a creditor."

5

Those are the terms that Congress uses when it's

6

legislating about fraudulent conveyance, which Congress

7

has done repeatedly and pervasively for a hundred and

8

fifty years.

9

If you look at the fraudulent conveyance

10

statutes, not a single one of them uses this term

11

"actual fraud."

12

associated, particularly with ­­

13

So this is not a term that's

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you have the 1924

14

Massachusetts statute copied from the Uniform Commercial

15

Code, which, in referring to fraudulent conveyance in

16

Section 7, uses these words:

17

actual intent as distinguished from intent presumed in

18

law to" ­­ da, da, da ­­ "hinder, delay, or defraud

19

present or future creditors is fraudulent."

20

MS. MURPHY:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

"Each conveyance made with

Sure.
I grant they did use the

22

word "actual intent," rather than "actual intent to

23

hinder delay, defraud," and then they said it is

24

fraudulent.

25

"actual fraud."

That sounds an awful lot like the words

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

MS. MURPHY:

And ­­ and to be clear, we

2

don't dispute that fraudulent conveyance is a form of

3

actual fraud.

4

falls within the scope of this particular exception

5

because this exception says more than just the words

6

"actual fraud."

7

for money, property, services or credit to the extent

8

obtained by false pretenses, false representations and

9

­­

It's just not a form of actual fraud that

It says that you have to have a debt

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MS. MURPHY:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, a ­­

­­ actual fraud.
The ­­ the friend who

13

obtained the $40,000 which the friend knew was owed to

14

the creditor of the transferor has obtained money, money

15

through ­­ it is a debt.

16

owes the debt to the creditors of the transferor because

17

she has the 40,000 knowing that it's wrongly conveyed.

18

So she now owes the debt to the creditors, and her debt

19

was obtained by actual fraud.

She owes the debt.

20

MS. MURPHY:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MS. MURPHY:

She now

I don't think it was.
Because?

Because she didn't use the

23

fraud to obtain the money.

24

you were talking about when you were giving the

25

hypothetical.

And this gets back to what

The fraud in a fraudulent conveyance is

Alderson Reporting Company

the first debtor concealing or misrepresenting the

creditor.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We're not limited to

10

fraudulent conveyances here.

You want to read the

11

statute and say something like for money obtained from

12

the innocent party in the first instance by.

13

that ­­ that ­­ but fraud can continue through ­­

14

through a whole chain.

15

MS. MURPHY:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it doesn't say ­­
We're not limited ­­
Sure.

And

Sure and ­­ and ­­
And ­­ and if it continues

17

through the whole chain, the person on the end of the

18

chain may have never had any relation with the innocent

19

party at all.

20

MS. MURPHY:

Well, I think that what you

21

need to have the fraud that comes within (a)(2) is

22

inducement.

23

inducement, it doesn't have to be direct.

24

position that, you know, unless the misstatement is made

25

expressly to the creditor, the debt doesn't count.

Now, the inducement, the fraudulent

Alderson Reporting Company

It's not our

You

1

can have, you know, a misstatement that you cause to be

2

made, that the statute actually uses that language

3

causing a misrepresentation to be made that the victim

4

at the end, the creditor ultimately relies upon.

5
6
7

So we're not saying there has to be a direct
relationship here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm totally confused

8

because I think ­­ I was following you up until that

9

last statement.

10

MS. MURPHY:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I was following you up to when you said that

13

it has to be a debt you obtain by fraud from the person.

Okay.

14

MS. MURPHY:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right?

Yes.
Whether I agree with you

16

or not, that's a different issue because I'm not sure

17

that you fully answered Justice Breyer.

18

understand where the inducement comes into this.

19

why did ­­ you can commit fraud against a person

20

directly in a variety of different ways that don't

21

22

fraud doesn't, as a matter of fact, require a

23

misrepresentation.

24
25

MS. MURPHY:

But I don't
Why ­­

Petitioner hasn't suggested otherwise, there's really

3

7

sore thumb.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There is ­­ there is

So, you know, the

Is fraudulent conveyance
And in this particular

Well, you just said you're

not contesting that fraudulent conveyance is a form of
actual fraud; is that right?

11

MS. MURPHY:

When it's done with intent, you

12

know, the necessary intent to make it actual fraud.

13

yes, that's right.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But

So, now, this language ­­ I

15

mean, the language just seems a lot more simple than

16

you're making it, because you add inducement to the

17

language, you add from the creditor to the language.

18

But the language doesn't say any of those things.

19

just says is there a debt?

20

debt here.

21

well, what has to be true of that money?

22

obtained by actual fraud.

23

It

The debt is for money.

The language says,

So whether or not

money has come from the creditor seems to be irrelevant

2

under this very simple statutory phrase.

3
4

MS. MURPHY:

I think that there is two ­­

two problems with that, in our view.

5

First, I don't agree that the fraud is how

6

you obtained the money.

7

doing so helped someone else commit a fraud on their

8

creditor.

9

in a fraudulent conveyance.

You have been a participant

10

in a fraud on someone else.

So I think even ­­

You obtained money, and by

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

helping someone by accepting the money, you're

committing a crime.

what gives rise to the debt.

That leaves out every

MS. MURPHY:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The ­­ the question ­­
The transferee ­­ the

22

transferee obtains the money by way of the fraudulent

the money, and that ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

conveyance.

5

MS. MURPHY:

The fraud occurs on the back

6

end.

7

the debtor effectively, you know, either conceals the

8

transaction, that's the fraud, or conceals the true

9

nature of the transaction.

10

Because of the transfer, there is then fraud when

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about Mr. Ponzi's

11

cousin who, in fact, had nothing to do with any of the

12

misrepresentations, but knowing the entire truth says

13

Ponzi, my friend, when you get those bags of cash, hide

14

them under my bed, all right?

15

Now, he himself has not, in fact, lied to

16

anybody or made any misrepresentations, but he's part of

17

the big scheme.

18

MS. MURPHY:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well ­­
And I take it we would say

20

that that money under the bed has been obtained by

21

actual fraud, hasn't it?

22

MS. MURPHY:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

Oh, so you're going to get

him off, too.

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

within (a)(2), aiding and abetting somebody else's

21

22

in which this statute ­­ you know, they have to give

23

some theories as to what narrows this statute so that it

24

doesn't completely swallow the additional fraud

25

provisions that Congress has added here.

And Petitioner themselves, they

So they ­­ they say that this is one of the ways

Alderson Reporting Company

And that's

Official

34
1

part of their theory, is that, you know, you do have to

2

have used the fraud to obtain it yourself.

3

But I think that part of it is that you

4

can't just look at the term "actual fraud" in isolation,

5

just as the other side agrees that you can't look at the

6

term "false representation" in isolation.

7

assume that false representation means fraudulent

8

misrepresentation.

9

and that's not what false representation means at common

10

Because they

11

At common law, false representation includes

negligent misrepresentation and innocent

misrepresentation.

15

they're agreeing that you can't just take these terms

16

and pluck them out of the statute and say, oh, what did

17

it mean at common law?

18

The question is, what did these terms mean in this

19

statute?

20

put the term "actual fraud" next to a bunch of terms

21

that by their nature speak of inducement.

22

If you look at the Restatement in

So

That's the end of the analysis.

And when you look at this statute, Congress

And that conduct, as you just said, includes

So I wouldn't use a term that had to do with
conduct just to state a mens rea requirement.

14

responses as to why I don't think it's actually that

15

unusual in this context.

16

isn't a theory that we concocted after the fact.

key sponsors said what Subsection (a) was intended to

do, and I quote, "It was intended to codify current case

very similar situation where you had a statute that was

interpreting that statute, and then Congress added to

the statute language that was mirroring the language of

7

this Court's cases.

11

And in that case the Court ­­ it was a

And in that circumstance, the Court said,
you know what, we have to look at that language in light
of the fact that they took it from our cases.
And here, if you look at the ­­ the cases

12

that they took this language from, they are cases that

13

use actual fraud to distinguish intentional fraud from

14

constructive fraud.

15

fraud to say, oh, here's what kind of fraud counts under

16

this statute, fraudulent conveyance.

They are not cases that use actual

17

In fact, the only cases that happen to

18

involve fraudulent conveyance and the term "actual

19

fraud" are cases where the Court held that the debt did

20

not fall within the scope of the exception to discharge.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you have any other

22

example in all of the U.S. Code where the word and

23

series of words A, or B, or C, and "or" is taken to mean

24

"by," and refer not to a discrete category, but modifies

25

the earlier category.

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. MURPHY:

I'm not sure I have an example

2

where it would ­­ you know, where ­­ where it quite

3

works like that.

4

many places in the U.S. Code where an item that comes at

5

the end of or later in a list is used to inform the

6

meaning of the word before it.

7

v. Clark itself, that's exactly the reasoning the Court

8

employed there.

9

But what I would say is that there are

And if you look at Neal

The reason the Court concluded that the only

10

kind of fraud that counted was intentional fraud was

11

because the next item in the list was embezzlement.

12

the Court said because embezzlement requires intent,

13

we're going to infer from that term that fraud requires

14

intent as well.

15

So the basic principle that adding language

16

to a statute can inform and limit the words that come

17

before it is nothing that extraordinary.

18

And

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's just ­­

Can you give me an

where someone would speak along the lines you're saying

22

MS. MURPHY:

Sure.

There's an example in a

23

statutory construction book of the phrase "cats, dogs,

24

or domesticated animals."

25

that phrase, "domesticated animals" is the one that

So the third

20

broadest conception of misrepresentation possible, even

21

if that's broader than the common law tort of false

22

misrepresentation.

23

What you can essentially view "actual

So one thing that some courts have said when

24

looking at this statute is that it's not clear that

25

false representation reached future looking, you know,

statements about whether I intend to perform in the

3

don't need to resolve that debate anymore because now

4

that the statute says "actual fraud," that's good enough

5

to tell us that the kinds of misrepresentations that

6

come within the scope of this statute include any kind

7

of misrepresentation that induces the creditor to part

8

with something, even if it might not technically have

9

qualified as false representation at common law.

And some courts have said, well, you know, we

10

So I think that there's plenty of ways for

11

this term to do work without having it kind of put this

12

sore thumb into the statute of fraudulent conveyance,

13

which is just nothing like the rest of the terms in this

14

statute.

15

It's nothing like false statements, false

16

representations, false financial statements.

17

those types of conduct that this statute has always

18

covered involve inducing the creditor to part with

19

something.

20

the 18 other exceptions in the statute.

21

All of

And that's what differentiates (a)(2) from

This is not the intentional fraud provision.

22

There's plenty of other provisions in the statute that

23

cover forms of intentional fraud, some of them by

24

directly using the word "fraud," others like (a)(6) by

25

covering intentional injuries to property interests.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

So it's not as if you need to put this

2

remedy into (a)(2) in order to ensure that if you really

3

do have intentional fraud in the receipt of a fraudulent

4

conveyance, there will be a means of having a debt

5

that's nondischargeable.

6

of strain to get it in here where it seems like such a

7

poor fit.

8
9

So I don't know why you kind

And the other thing that I think is worth
keeping note of is that Congress has legislated, quite

10

specifically, on fraudulent conveyance for 150 years.

11

And there are two things that you can note repeatedly

12

when Congress does so.

13

First of all, it uses particular language

14

of ­­ of fraudulent convenance.

15

fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer, or a

16

transfer made with intent to injure, hinder, delay, or

17

defraud a creditor.

18

It talks about a

But the other thing is that the remedies

19

Congress has created for fraudulent conveyance are not

20

creditor­specific.

21

basic principle of equitable distribution.

22

They are instead consistent with the

Under 727(a)(2), you have a complete bar to

23

discharge which benefits everybody because no debtor

24

gets a discharge.

25

Under 548(a)(1) and the other provisions

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

that allow the trustee to void transactions, the money

2

comes back to the estate and then gets distributed

3

equitably to all creditors.

4

Here, instead, you have a creditor who's

5

basically jumping the line and saying we should get all

6

of this money, even though within the context of the

7

Chrysalis bankruptcy, the trustee did not see fit to try

8

to void these transactions, and there was no attempt by

9

the trustee to void transactions in this bankruptcy,

10

either.

11

So you end up with a remedy that is really

12

nothing like the ones that Congress has offered when it

13

is actually legislating clearly on the topic of

14

fraudulent transfers ­­
