ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FLEMING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Iowa statute under which Mr. Mathis was

12

convicted defines one crime, and Iowa does not need to

13

prove generic burglary to convict under it.

14

Circuit below and the government here, nonetheless, want

15

to use the modified categorical approach.

16

usual purpose, which is to identify the kind of

17

conviction, we know what that is, but rather to identify

18

the means of commission.

19

categorical approach, and it's irreconcilable with both

20

the result and the reasoning of this Court's decision in

21

Descamps.

The Eighth

Not for its

That is contrary to ACCA's

22

One of ­­

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is that so?

I mean,

24

here we have the crime, burglary, and there are two ways

25

of committing it.

One involves a structure; one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

involves a vehicle.

2

We look at the charge.

3

not for a vehicle.

4

And those can be easily divided.
The charge is for a structure,

Why ­­ why is it not divisible?

MR. FLEMING:

For the exact same reason,

5

Justice Ginsburg, that the California statute at issue

6

in Descamps was not divisible.

7

the indictment charged that Mr. Descamps had unlawfully

8

and feloniously entered the grocery store.

9

prosecutor stated as much, that Mr. Descamps had broken

In that case as well,

The

10

and entered into a grocery store, and Mr. Descamps did

11

not object to that.

12

Nonetheless, this Court, quite properly,

13

held that it was not divisible because California was

14

not required to prove unlawful entry in order to get a

15

conviction.

16

The same is true of Mr. Mathis.

Iowa did

17

not have to prove the type of occupied structure that he

18

supposedly burglarized.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he did one or the

20

other.

21

have to be proved under the State statute.

22

have to prove unlawful.

23

In Descamps, there was an element that didn't

MR. FLEMING:

You didn't

The ­­ the ­­ California would

24

have had to prove entry, just as Iowa would have to

25

prove an occupied structure.

But California did not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

5
1

have to prove whether the entry was unlawful as would

2

have been required to make the offense a generic

3

burglary offense.

4

Similarly here, Iowa did not need to prove

5

burglary of a building as opposed to burglary of a land,

6

air, or water vehicle or similar place.

7

issues that there's no dispute a jury could have divided

8

on or Mr. Mathis would not have had to admit

9

specifically in order to permit a conviction under the

10

Those are

Iowa statute.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

But they have to prove

12

one ­­ they define, somewhere, structure, right, in the

13

statute?

14

MR. FLEMING:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

They do, Justice Breyer.
And don't you have to prove

16

that definition applies?

18

something.

I mean, that wouldn't count, would it?

19

MR. FLEMING:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

It might not.
Right.

But ­­

Well, if it does

21

not, don't you have to at least prove that it falls

22

within the definition?

MR. FLEMING:

The definition of occupied

structure.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Okay.

And, similarly, in Taylor,

you have to prove that it falls within the statute's

definition of boat or car or house.

prove one of the three.

MR. FLEMING:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right?

You have to

That is the difference.
But you don't have to

10

prove ­­ you have to prove in Massachusetts if you have

11

an indictment which says it was like a houseboat, so

12

they're not certain what it counts as.

13

don't you have to prove our prosecutor says it's a boat

or a house?

because it wasn't disputed in Shepard that the answer is

no and that ­­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

The answer is no?

You

cannot convict a person, say, on a houseboat in

Massachusetts where the prosecutor says it's either a

5

house or a boat?

6

difference is?

7

They have to go into what the

MR. FLEMING:

As this Court interpreted it

8

in ­­ in Shepard, house or a boat are elements of the

9

crime.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, in other words, if six

11

people think a houseboat is a boat and six people think

a houseboat is a house, the guy gets off ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

you have any case on that?
MR. FLEMING:

­­ in Massachusetts?

I would be rather surprised.
Not in Massachusetts,

Your Honor, but this is an Iowa case.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I know.

But what I'm

19

driving at, it's the same thing, the same thing.

20

you've made up a very ingenious difference.

21

isn't it just the same thing here as was in

22

Massachusetts?

23

Do

MR. FLEMING:

But

But why

Because Massachusetts and Iowa

24

have chosen to define different crimes, and they have

25

the prerogative to do that.

If Iowa says, we don't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

8
1

care, as it has said, ultimately what the means is ­­

2

the location of the burglary is a means ­­ the jury can

3

divide on that and still convict as long as they find an

4

occupied structure.

5

There's no dispute.

6

State v. Duncan holds that.

In that circumstance, one cannot be sure

7

whether it's a jury trial, which this ­­ and this was

8

not except for the case of one, as revealed by the

9

record, or a plea, if Mr. Mathis had been told you are

10

being charged with burglarizing a garage and he said, oh

11

no, I didn't break into a garage.

12

parked outside the garage; that would have made no

13

difference under Iowa law and he would have had no basis

14

to contest the means of commission.

15

even have allowed him to do it, and certainly his

16

defense attorney would have said, let's not burden the

17

prosecutor.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, there are a lot of

12

reasons why Iowa might want to take the approach that

13

it ­­ that it does.

14

suppose the evidence involves the burglary of a trailer.

15

So you'd have the rather ridiculous situation of a

16

jury ­­ if that was ­­ if those are separate elements,

17

then if six of the jurors thought, well, this trailer is

18

not very movable, so I think it's a house, and the other

19

others say, well, you know, it's possible you could hook

20

it up to a truck and move it, so it's a vehicle.

there couldn't be an agreement, and the defendant would

be acquitted.

MR. FLEMING:

But the ­­ the point,

11

Justice Alito, is that the State is free to define its

crime as it wishes.

13

may decide it prefers to make it easier for its State

sentencing court supposed to do in the situation like

the Massachusetts situation where there is no case,

22

there is no Massachusetts case?

supposed to do?

24
25

So what is the court

Now, in ­­ this Court has said it's ­­ it's
as simple as pie to determine whether something is ­­ is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

an element or a means.

2

tell me what the ­­ what the Federal sentencing court

3

would do in that situation.

4

That's your view, too.

MR. FLEMING:

But just

If there truly were a

5

situation where all else had failed, all the standard

6

tools of statutory interpretation ­­

7

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Which will often be the

case.
MR. FLEMING:

Will sometimes be the case.

10

There are a number of them that we cite where State law

11

is plain on the point, and the State courts have had to

12

resolve this, whether in the context of the double

13

jeopardy challenge or a challenge to the indictment or

14

request for unanimous jury instructions.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what ­­ what happens if

16

there is that State case that says whether this is

17

definitively an element or a means?

18

MR. FLEMING:

In the situation where that

19

arises, obviously, the sentencing court will apply the

20

ordinary tools of statutory interpretation, looking at

21

the text to say ­­ for instance, in the case of

22

Vermont ­­ are they punishing one of the particular

You're going to tell us that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, then how can you tell

from the ­­ from the charging document that something is
an element or a means?

11

MR. FLEMING:

I think if, in the limited

12

situation that Justice Kagan's question posited, which

13

is when you have a situation where a prosecutor charges

14

house and boat together in one count, that would be a

15

duplicitous indictment if they were different elements.

16

So that is a clue that at least the prosecutor viewed

17

them as different means of commission of a single

18

offense.

8

MR. FLEMING:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, the problem ­­

­­ and ­­

is that "feloniously entered" had two potential

11

meanings:

unlawfully and committed a crime.

14

which of the two it is because it ­­ it's not an

dispositive of figuring out whether the generic offense

have lost, because his indictment said, "willfully,

So there was no question, if you were to ­­

MR. FLEMING:

So there's a general answer to

the question and a specific answer to the question.

general answer is that the Court determines the elements

It is a way of committing the offense.
MR. FLEMING:

I ­­ I view, Justice Ginsburg,

a way of committing the offense as a synonym for the

The definition of an element, which this Court

10

used in Richardson ­­ and I don't think it's disputed.

I think the government uses it in its own brief ­­ is a

12

fact that the prosecution must prove to the jury beyond

MR. FLEMING:

This ­­ this Court in Taylor

relied on the fact that Congress used the word

"convictions" as opposed to someone who had committed an

offense, and also looked at the legislative history,

19

which specifically indicated that Congress did not mean

a conviction for a particular crime to sometimes be an

act of predicate and sometimes not.

is that the ­­ the court was telling you in the first

jury doesn't have to be unanimous in respect to it.

14

Now, if you take those same words out of

would give you is an example.

23

Court's opinion in Descamps, was the way that this Court

24

showed that the Ninth Circuit was wrong was it gave two

25

examples of an assault­with­a­weapon statute.

And this was in the

Alderson Reporting Company

It said

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

32

imagine an assault­with­a­weapon statute that just says

2

"a weapon" and doesn't specify any weapons.

3

imagine a second statute that says "assault with a

weapon" and specifies eight individual weapons.

5

there a difference between those two cases?

6

And the Court's opinion says yes.

statement, which is that it didn't matter whether it was

an element or something else.

17

as long as it's phrased in the disjunctive.

So that gets you back to your first

A means was just as good

18

And, you know, all of our cases ­­ it's not

19

just Descamps ­­ it goes back to Taylor and Shepard and

20

Johnson.

21

Descamps in the introduction uses the word "elements"

22

ten times.

23

whatever, it's a funny thing ­­ it's a funny way to

24

write all of our opinions.

25

They all use the language of elements.

So if we really meant elements or means or

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, two ­­ I think this is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

33
1

a critical question, and there are really two responses

2

to it.

3

is this question of, can you divide up the statute for

4

matching purposes, the Court said "element," and it also

5

equated that with the statutory alternatives.

6

that throughout the opinion.

The first is when describing divisibility, which

7

It did

The second point is that there's a reason

8

that when the Court ­­ the Court could say "element" and

9

"statutory alternatives" interchangeably, because a

distinction between means and elements doesn't matter to

11

divisibility.

Court has explained, is you need to make sure that the

defendant was convicted of the generic offense, that

the ­­ the jury or the fact­finder necessarily found the

tell that from the ordinary application in the modified

I think really the heart of the modified

And you can

But you see, Descamps makes

20

it quite clear that there's two different kinds of

21

looking ­­ what Descamps says is you have to be able to

22

say that a person was necessarily convicted of

23

something.

24

MS. SAHARSKY:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.
Meaning that the statute

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

34

requires him to be convicted of something.

2

good enough to look at the course of proceedings and to

3

infer that a jury or a judge actually did find

4

something.

5

that ­­ you know, I mean, sometimes those inferences can

be very powerful.

7

That what you have to find is a necessary finding in the

8

sense that a statute makes something necessary in order

for a conviction to occur.

10

It is not

Descamps says this in no uncertain terms,

And Descamps says it's not enough.

And that's the distinction

between elements and means.

Okay.

Well, we think that

that general approach is correct, which, to us, we ­­

you know, we understood this to say, just look to the

statute of conviction in the Shepard documents.

15

Now, when ­­ when only one thing is at

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, here, you have a

particular State court decision that says exactly what

25

is an element and what is a means and that this is ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

this is not an element.

2

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right, but I don't think ­­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you don't need to look

4

any further than a dispositive State court decision on

5

the subject.

6

MS. SAHARSKY:

A couple of ­­ a couple of

7

responses.

8

don't think ­­ these questions don't arise under the

9

State courts very often.

The first is, is that these decisions, I

I think between all of the

10

resources and the parties in this case, we've only found

11

two State court decisions that address a place being

12

burgled.

13

fact that this burglary of a building or a boat, this

14

Massachusetts, is really a paradigmatic example that

15

this Court has always offered of a divisible statute.

16

So to not know now under State law whether that's

17

divisible is particular problematic under Petitioner's

18

approach.

19

And I think that's problematic in light of the

But just to get back to what I think was

20

your ­­ your central question, because I think this is

21

really important about Descamps and why we're reading

22

the opinion our way:

23

end of footnote 2, which we think essentially says that

24

for ACCA purposes, when you have something in the

25

Shepard documents, it is ­­ it functions as an element

Aside from this conclusion at the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

38
1

in that case.

2

But aside from that, I think there are two

3

other very telling parts of the Court's opinion in

4

Descamps.

5

throughout its opinion says, that settled law, the

6

Court's 20 years of precedent up to that point, pretty

7

much resolved that question, all but settles this

8

question.

9

settled law.

10

One is that the Court starts its opinion, and

The Court was not purporting to change
It wasn't purporting to do something

extraordinary like require a State law inquiry.

11

In fact, the whole Petitioner's argument in

12

Descamps, why you couldn't do the thing the Ninth

13

Circuit wanted to do was because this whole thing is

14

settled.

15

the Ninth Circuit is really doing this kind of outlier

16

approach and you shouldn't do that.

17

You just look at the text of the statute, and

So we read the opinion in Descamps as a

18

whole to say we're just applying settled law.

19

that's our position in this case, is we just want to

20

apply the settled law in divisibility.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

now, how does Descamps come out?

23

out?

24
25

MS. SAHARSKY:

And

Applying your approach
How does Descamps come

Same result.

Same result,

because I think, as your question suggested, there is a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

39
1

critical difference between Descamps and this case.

2

Because there, there was an overbroad statutory term,

3

and there just was nothing in the statute that

4

corresponded to generic burglary.

5

the Court said is what you have to do.

6

the offense was the person committed ­­ convicted of,

7

and does it correspond to generic burglary?

couldn't make that inquiry ­­

And I think this ­­

this really goes to the heart of why the Court decided

weapon and one that prohibits assault with one of eight

6

infinitely divide up the terms of the statute to imagine

7

any number of subcrimes and then try to match them to

8

the Federal offense.

9

When it just says "assault with a

When you don't have a statutory alternative,

10

the Court's opinion in Descamps says what you're really

11

doing is just matching the facts of the defendant's

12

conviction, if you can find them in the Shepard

13

documents, with the generic Federal offense?

14

in the case where there is no statutory alternative,

15

like you said, you're just kind of combing through the

16

documents, and the court in Descamps said, don't do

17

that.

18

try to comb through the facts.

19

this statute, like many burglary statutes, including the

20

example the Court has given, covers burglary of multiple

places, right?

22

23

version of the offense was this person convicted of.

24

Was it the burglary of a house, or was it the burglary

25

of a boat?

But we're not doing that here.

So it is

We don't need to

All we're saying is that

It covers burglary of buildings and
And you just need to see which

1

And so you look at the conviction documents

2

to do it, and you're just matching the offense as

3

defined by the legislature in that case with the Federal

4

generic offense.

5

facts ­­

6

You're not trying to just match

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Here's what the statute

7

doesn't do.

8

anybody to convict you of any single one of those

9

things.

The statute doesn't make it necessary for

And one of the points, since 95 percent of

10

cases end in pleas, the statute doesn't make it

11

necessary for you to plead to any one of those things.

12

So whatever information is floating around

13

in these opinions, nobody has had to find ­­ and the

14

defendant has not had to plead to a particular offense

15

with one of those alternative means.

16

MS. SAHARSKY:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well ­­
And that's the critical

18

thing under, not just Descamps, under all of these

elements­based decisions, is that it doesn't matter what

you did.

something.

two different ­­ I think it's important to divide

2

between the two different parts of the inquiry.

is two questions, right?

to generic burglary.

8
9

And then the second is, was the

And I think your question gets to the heart
of we need to make sure this person actually was

10

convicted of generic burglary, and I don't think you

11

need to do a separate State law inquiry to answer that

12

question because that's really what the modified

13

categorical approach was designed to do, that you look

14

at the Shepard documents and see.

15

Can we tell that the person was convicted of

16

this form of burglary or not?

17

the modified that ­­ the Shepard documents in

19

alternatives.

21

example, right?

23

no one, I think, ever asks the question, well, in a

In a case where we have a defendant who

2

who was charged with a building and a boat be convicted

3

if they didn't find if it was the building or find if ­­

4

no one thinks about it, because in this case where only

5

the building is at issue, you have to find the building

6

to convict it.

7

I mean, it's functioning as an element in

8

that case.

9

convicted, or you don't find building and the

10

Either you find building and the person is

individual, as a matter of law, can't be convicted.

11

So we think that the modified categorical

12

approach resolves and answers this concern that you have

13

suggested about the Court ensuring that the person

14

actually was convicted of generic burglary.

15

Petitioner's approach would do, even though in a

16

modified categorical approach already answered that

17

question, would try to ingraft this State law inquiry

18

onto divisibility.

19

Court's opinions, regardless of what the Court said in

20

Descamps, the Court's opinions definitely have not done

21

before.

22

And what

And it's one that, you know, the

And I think this goes back to Descamps and

23

why we think it goes our way is that the Court provided

24

these examples in Descamps, and it's provided them in

25

other cases too.

And those examples just didn't depend

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

44

on parsing State law.

2

the ­­ the most paradigmatic was the one Justice Breyer

suggested, which was a burglary statute that covers

buildings and houses, that covers houses and boats,

et cetera.

Those examples for ­­ I think

And the Court has said on at least five

occasions, I mean, Descamps says this twice, that that

statute is divisible, and it ­­ it just would be odd for

the Court to have said so many times that the statute is

divisible if, in fact, it's divisible in some cases, if

What was ­­

I think ­­
What was the purpose for

which the State may classify this as a means rather than

an element?

made that determination?

20

What was the context in which the State

MS. SAHARSKY:

This question only arises

21

when a person has been charged with more than one thing,

22

so a burglary of a building and a boat, for example.

23

And then the question is, if this goes to trial and the

jury ­­ and it goes to the jury, does the jury

10

I mean,

I thought I'd be able to look at all 50
Between the

And I think another example that ­­ that

11

illustrates how this doesn't come up very often is the

12

drug statutes.

13

prior cases that some State drug schedules list a lot of

14

drugs that aren't on the Federal schedule.

15

Mellouli, the Court, you know, had to figure out, is

16

this like the Federal offense or is this not like the

17

Federal offense?

18

looked at this or judges who looked at this said, you

19

know, it's amazing because there are so many California

20

drug convictions, and there is just no law in whether

21

the drug is ­­ has to be ­­ the type of drug has to be

proven unanimously in the case where more than one is at

issue.

24
25

I think this Court knows from other

So in

And the Ninth Circuit justices who

And when you talk about, you know, things
like that where the Court in itself has assumed that the

drug statutes would be divisible, and we don't know that

2

answer for a case like California, I think it ­­ it

3

would really be a remarkable change to what the Court

4

has done so far with the modified categorical approach.

5

It's really not something that the Court's opinions have

6

done in any meaningful way, and I think it would be

7

unfortunate when the Court has provided examples like

8

the burglary of a building or a boat and the Court's

9

relied on those examples.

Like the district court in

10

this case and the Court of Appeals both relied on those

11

examples and said, this is the exact ­­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is this right?

Is this

like ­­ like even with the Massachusetts statute, the

14

question has never come up.

15

what the jury has to find in the case of a houseboat.

16

So we don't really know

But where there's a word in the statute,

17

like Descamps, and that alternative thing like

18

houseboat, da da, da, is not in the statute, but rather

19

it's a judge­made interpretation of the statute, and the

20

courts say there is several different categories, it

21

would be virtually impossible for a court under those

22

circumstances to say that the A, B and C, which it

23

divided the statute into, that they're elements.

24

would have to say they're means.

25

You

Do you think?

I don't think a State court would have the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

47
1

power to, in the face of a statute that doesn't itself

2

divide things, to say that, A is an element of the crime

3

that has to be defined, and then B is a different

4

element of a different crime.

MS. SAHARSKY:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well ­­
Is that ­­ is that ­­ I

have no idea of the answer to that question.

knew the answer to that question, it would help me.

I'm
And if you

10

MS. SAHARSKY:

11

answers to that question.

12

and this is ­­ the Court left this question open in

Descamps about the extent to which you could use

judicial decisions.

15

circumstances a judge could or a court could define a

crime.

20

Well, I think there are two
The first is, we do think ­­

But we do think that in some

That's not something the Court had to answer.
But I think the second answer, which

21

hopefully gets to your question, is, you know, can we ­­

22

either rules of thumb or something with the State courts

23

that we can try to figure out whether something is a

24

means or is an element based on how the statute's

25

written?

And I think the real trouble is that we can't.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

48
1

I mean, we've looked to try to find a source

2

of law in Massachusetts, and we've also looked to what

3

the ­­ what the State courts have told us their

4

approaches are, and this is in our brief.

5

example, they say, you know, we don't have bright­line

6

rules.

7

rules, but they're mind bending in their application.

8

That's what one of the State courts said.

9

this is not a predictable area.

But, for

We have to use a multi­factor test.

You know,

And I think actually

10

the Court recommends the same thing.

11

component of the Court's reasoning in Schad.

12

We set out

And this was a key

Schad was the plurality opinion that was

13

asking if ­­ are there constitutional limitations on how

14

a court ­­ how a State legislature can define "means"

15

versus "elements."

16

legislature had said, the jury doesn't unanimously have

17

to agree on whether murder is premeditated murder or

18

felony murder.

19

can you really say that the jury doesn't have to agree

20

on that?

21

That was a case in which the State

And the defendant came in and said, wow,

There should be some constitutional limit.
And one critical part of the Court's opinion

22

was that there aren't any bright­line rules about what

23

constitutes a means or what constitutes an element.

24

It's a matter of State law, and there is wide variation

25

of that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

49
1

So as much as we have looked, we don't think

2

that there is an easy answer to the State law questions,

3

and we think, you know, it's really asking a lot to

4

think that Federal courts are going to be doing those in

5

the first instance.

6

the State legislature's intent, and you're talking

7

about, you know, either taking those questions kind of

8

away from the State courts and having Federal courts

9

start to do them on a routine basis or ­­ we're talking

I mean, these are questions about

10

about what one judge in the Ninth Circuit suggested,

11

which is we're never going to find out these answers

12

unless we certify these questions to the State courts.

13

And if you're talking about sentencing judges who

14

sentence every day and have to use the modified

15

categorical approach, you know, certifying to the State

16

courts, I think that really would be, you know,

17

an extraordinary intrusion.

18

So, you know, at the end of the day, I think

19

we think that the Court really has a choice in this case

20

between the approach that it's used for 25 years and the

21

examples that it's given and Petitioner's approach, and

22

we think that Petitioner's approach really would up end

7

That a statute is divisible when it sets out

Sure.

Yeah.

I'm glad to.

8

statutory alternatives, one of which corresponds to the

9

Federal generic offense, that you don't need to

10

undertake a State law inquiry into whether something is

11

a means or element.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Which is to say that

13

elements don't matter, and that's the thing that is

14

contrary to 25 years of this Court's precedents, because

15

if this Court's precedents say anything, they say that

16

this is an elements­based inquiry, which means that we

17

have to decide whether something is an element.

18

MS. SAHARSKY:

I ­­ and that's ­­ that's

19

really, I think, the next thing I was ­­ I was hoping to

20

say, which is that the reason that the Court has talked

21

about elements as well as the statutory alternatives is

22

because it wants to have an assurance that the person

23

actually was convicted of generic burglary.

24

you get the assurance is not through this State law

25

inquiry into whether something is a means in a

7

documents and you see what they actually did.

8

Court has said in no uncertain terms that that's not

9

what we do.

10

You look at the Shepard
But this

Much as ­­ much as some people think that

11

that's an intuitive way to decide these questions, much

12

as some people think that maybe we should have done that

13

25 years ago, but we don't do that.

14

let's look at the documents and see what the guy did.

15

We say, let's look at the documents and see if he was

16

necessarily convicted of something, meaning that the law

17

required him ­­ the law required that a particular

18

finding be made in order for this conviction to occur.

19

We don't look at,

And that's where your approach is something

20

very different from what we've ever done, because you're

21

saying that, notwithstanding that the law did not

22

require that a particular finding be made, we'll take a

23

look at the documents and decide that that finding was

24

made.

25

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, maybe I should clarify

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

52
1

a little bit and say that we think that we look to see

2

whether the law required that this finding be made in

3

reality in this case, not hypothetically in some

4

different case.

5

using the Shepard documents in conjunction with the fact

6

that the statute lists alternatives.

7

And what I mean by that is, we are

And what we are doing ­­ the reason that

8

we're not looking at facts is because the alternatives

9

show that the legislature has defined this thing, entry

10

into a building, as part of the offense, as a way to

11

commit the offense.

12

And then the question, the whole point of

13

the modified categorical approach, is:

14

the person was convicted of that thing or something else

15

with certainty using the Shepard documents?

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can we know if

But the point of the

17

modified categorical approach is to take a truly

18

divisible statute ­­ in other words, a statute with

19

three separate elements in it, of which you only need to

20

be convicted of one ­­ and to figure out whether the one

21

that you were convicted of, the one particular element,

22

matches up with the generic offense.

23

It's not to do anything more than that.

24

Descamps is quite clear on this ­­ on this matter, that

25

it takes ­­ it's ­­ it's three separate elements.

Alderson Reporting Company

Do

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

53

you ­­ does what you were convicted of, is that the

2

right element to match the generic offense?

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think that we're in

4

agreement to the extent that we're talking about

Federal offense.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Except that you say

8

"statutory alternatives," and I say "elements," because

9

for 25 years we've been saying "elements," and that we

10

can't do this inquiry if we're in the world of

11

nonelemental facts.

12

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, frankly, I think the

13

Court has said both things.

14

Descamps, there's actually a part of the Court's opinion

15

that equates the two.

16

You know, in the opinion in

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Elements are what defines

the crime.
MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

But I think that the

20

­­ the court used "elements" to mean the statutory

21

definition, because the alternatives set out in the

22

statute do define the crime.

23

And I ­­ I take your point, that the

24

ultimate concern of the modified categorical approach is

25

ensuring that the individual actually was convicted of

Alderson Reporting Company

generic burglary.

2

look to the separate State law question about what

3

happens in a different defendant's case.

4

what the means analysis that ­­ that was Justice

5

Ginsburg's question, right, goes to, which is:

6

happens in a different case when more than one thing is

7

at issue?

8
9

But I don't think that we need to

I mean, that's

What

When ­­ when we have a statute that sets
out, this is a form of burglary, and the Court has

10

talked about different version of the offense, a version

11

of the offense is burglary of a building, and so the

12

legislature has defined that as an offense.

13

question is:

14

that offense?

15

And the

Did the defendant ­­ was he convicted of

I think ­­ and this, I think, goes to the

16

other part of your question, which is, you're asking

17

about how is that any different from fact­finding,

18

right?

19

answered that question in Descamps when it gave the

20

example of a statute that doesn't have the alternatives,

21

like the weapons one, as opposed to a statute that does

22

have the alternatives.

23

have the alternatives, you don't have an option that was

24

identified by the legislature as part of the definition

25

of the crime that you're trying to match to the Federal

That's just fact­finding.

And I think the Court

2

You're not just ­­ you're not looking at

something that the legislature has defined and saying,

4

well, did the Shepard documents show that or do they not

show that?

hole in the statute, right?

7

example, in Descamps, the different types of entries.

8

And you're just filling in that hole with facts.

16

Circuit, and the court called it a modified factual

17

approach at that point, right, because you're just

18

trying to match the facts of what the defendant did.

19

There's no statutory basis for calling this building ­­

20

this type of burglary, you know, burglary.

21

The Ninth Circuit ­­ one judge in the Ninth

But here we have that statutory basis.

We

22

have those statutory alternatives.

23

said on so many different occasions, and the lower

24

courts have relied on it, that it's the presence of

25

statutory or alternatives that are critical because when

Alderson Reporting Company

And the Court has

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

56
1

you have that ­­ those in combination with the Shepard

2

documents, you can make the decision of whether that

3

statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction,

4

whether the person was convicted of that version of

5

burglary or not.

6

But when you don't have that statutory

7

phrase there ­­ the Court said this on page 2287 of its

8

opinion in Descamps ­­ you're just asking what the

9

defendant actually did.

And then once you're doing

10

that, when you're not looking at the way the legislature

11

has defined the crime, there's really no stopping point,

12

right?

13

concern of the Court's opinion in Descamps, is that he

14

could have been convicted of something that has nothing

15

to do with burglary, and we'll just try to look through

16

all the facts in the Shepard documents and see if

17

they're really burglary.

And I think that was the ­­ the ­­ one of the

The Court said don't do that.

18

But here, the legislature has defined this

19

offense so that it ­­ the ­­ all components of generic

20

burglary are in the offense.

21

Court's instinct, to think, well, we said "elements,"

22

and elements means we have to make sure that the

23

person ­­ that this actually was proven.

24

that the modified categorical approach itself, by taking

25

the statute and then looking at the Shepard documents,

And I understand the

Alderson Reporting Company

But we think

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

57

2

does that, that it really satisfies the concern.
And frankly, that's ­­ that ­­ that was the

3

message that we got.

4

best what its opinion in Descamps meant, but that was

5

the message we got from the end of footnote 2 of

6

Descamps, which says, you know, whether something is a

7

means or elements, you shouldn't parse State law.

8

should just look to the Shepard documents.

9

what we're saying, is just to look to the Shepard

10
11

And of course, the Court knows

You

And that's

documents, and if something is ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, the end of footnote 2

12

said in some cases you won't need to parse State law

13

because you can figure it out from the Shepard

14

documents, because Shepard documents are a clue to

15

whether something is a means or an element.

16

And so in the situation in which State law

17

is not, as it is in this case, utterly clear on the

18

subject, you won't have to go 1,000 layers down, because

19

the Descamps ­­ the ­­ the Shepard documents will tell

20

you, because of the way the prosecutor has charged

21

something, looks like this is just a means, or looks

22

like this is really an element.

23

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, I mean, we don't think

24

you need to do the State law inquiry in the first place,

25

because the Shepard documents will tell you that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

58
1

person actually was convicted of that.

2

this question about whether it was ­­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why wouldn't you look

4

to State law?

5

that this is not an element.

6

that?

7

And I just think

You have a State law that says exactly

MS. SAHARSKY:

Why wouldn't you just take

Because ­­ because it doesn't

8

matter that that case is about what would happen to a

9

different defendant in a case where more than one thing

10

is charged.

11

happens in that hypothetical case because this

12

individual, and the individuals where we're trying to

13

use the Shepard documents to actually enhance, have just

14

one thing charged, right?

15

building, and burglary of a building is generic

16

burglary, and there's no dispute that the ­­ the statute

17

says burglary of a building, and this is burglary of a

building, and it would be odd to give that defendant a

pass because ­­

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

Alderson Reporting Company

It's ­­ it's

It's

2

want to have uniformity, right?

3

and you want to make sure that everyone who's been

4

convicted of the same type of offense actually is

5

treated the same.

6

Congress said burglary,

And I think that the problem with

7

Petitioner's approach is that you could have defendants

8

convicted in two states that have the exact same State

9

statute, their Shepard documents could look exactly the

10

same, and then this answer might turn on whether you

11

could find some sort of State law that would say what

12

would happen in a different case where defendant is

13

charged with more than one thing.

14
15

So we think that the Court's approach is

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MS. SAHARSKY:

And I ­­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Please.

19

MS. SAHARSKY:

It ­­

Just ­­ just one other point,

20

which is:

21

that the Court adopted ­­ and let's go back to where

22

this started, right?

23

under the ACCA?

24

definition it did, which is generic burglary, because it

25

encompassed the definitions in most States.

I think it's really telling that the reason

It's:

What does burglary mean

And the Court adopted the burglary

Alderson Reporting Company

The Court

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

60
1

wanted to reach the common denominator in most States.

2

And the effect of Petitioner's position, I

3

think we all agree, is that it would not ­­ the modified

4

categorical approach would not reach burglary in ­­ in

5

most States; that the ACCA would have a very limited

6

application at best under Petitioner's approach.

7

And of course, you know the modified

8

categorical approach is used in so many different areas,

9

and so these problems with parsing State law, et cetera,

10

would just be multiplied through all of the other

11

different statutes in which the Court has used the

12

modified categorical approach.

13

So we really think that Petitioner is ­­ is

14

doing what, you know, was the outlier approach in ­­ in

15

Descamps, which is trying to change, you know, 20­plus

16

years of settled law and start having this new

17

additional inquiry.

18

We just think you shouldn't do it.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Here you have a State

19

statute that specifically tells you that this is not an

20

element of the offense.

21

that you thought that you could ignore that ­­ excuse

22

me, not a State statute, but a State judicial opinion ­­

23

why it was that you could ignore that.

24
25

And you were saying why it was

The only reason you could ignore that State
judicial opinion is because if you don't care it's an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

61

element.

2

saying since Taylor.

And that's very much against what we've been

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

4

I ­­ I don't think that's true.

Could I respond?
The reason

5

that you don't care is because you can tell from the

6

Shepard documents that the individual in this case, and

7

in some similar cases, actually was convicted of generic

8

burglary.

9

And that defendant doesn't care whether it's

10

a means or an element, because it had to be proven in

11

his case for him to get convicted.

12

We think the judgment should be affirmed.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FLEMING:

18

What has been on the books for 25 years is

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

19

this Court's statement in Taylor that the categorical

20

approach turns on "the elements of the statute of

21

conviction."

22

"what facts are necessarily established by a conviction

23

for the State offense."

24
25

Or as the Court put it in Moncrieffe,

It's been very clear from my colleague's
argument that the government is interested in what

Alderson Reporting Company

Mr. Mathis did, and that is not what ACCA looks to.

2

is not the categorical approach.

3

offered no reason of principle to distinguish this case

4

from Mr. Descamps' case.

5

the two cases is that Iowa statute uses the word "or"

6

with a disjunctive list, and California does it by

7

silence by simply using the word "enters" without adding

8

"lawfully" or "unlawfully."

9

The government has

The only distinction between

There is no reason to treat those situations

As ­­ as some States have

That was too

MR. FLEMING:

May I respond, Mr. Chief

The issue did not come up before Descamps.
