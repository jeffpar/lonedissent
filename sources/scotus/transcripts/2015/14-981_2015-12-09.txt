CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

4

this morning in Case 14­981, Fisher v. The University of

5

Texas at Austin.

6

Before we get started, I'll advise the

7

lawyers that this is our only case this morning, so we

8

intend to grant the parties ten minutes or so of extra

9

So Mr. Rein, no need to rush.

MR. REIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I appreciate the extra time, and I didn't
rush up here to start before you invited me this time.
In reviewing the Fifth Circuit's initial

19

decision in what we call Fisher I, seven members of this

20

Court reaffirmed that a clear precondition to the use of

21

race as an admissions factor was the ability to satisfy

22

what was called the "demanding burden of strict

23

scrutiny" articulated in Grutter and Bakke.

24
25

By establishing that she was considered for
admission to UT under a system that discriminated

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

against her on the basis of her race, Ms. Fisher placed

2

upon UT the burden of ­­ of proving, by evidence of

3

record, that its use of race was, first, in pursuit of a

4

compelling, constitutionally legitimate interest

5

expressed with sufficient clarity and concreteness to

6

allow a reviewing court to determine, first, that the

7

use of race was a necessary last resort in pursuing the

8

interest defined, taking into account reasonably

9

available nonracial alternatives.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rein, may I ask, if

11

we didn't have the 10 percent plan, if that were out of

12

this case, and all that were left were the Grutter­like

13

plan, would you then recognize that you had no claim?

14

We have the ­­ what ­­ what the University

15

of Texas has added on to the 10 percent plan.

16

we wipe out the 10 percent, and we have only the

17

Grutter­like plan.

18

MR. REIN:

But now

Well, I ­­ with respect, I ­­ I

19

would question the premise of the question because it's

20

not the Grutter­like plan in its entirety.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If they had to use race,

2

how are they using it improperly?

3

MR. REIN:

If you have to use race and you

4

want to use the model that was created in Bakke and

5

Grutter, you would need to build profiles of individuals

6

that would allow you to judge them one against another

7

in the context of the class and the educational

8

experience you are trying to create.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

My God, that sounds like

10

it's using race more rather than less than this plan

11

does.

12

MR. REIN:

I ­­ I'm sorry if it sounds that

13

way.

14

Bakke situation where you're looking at every aspect of

15

an individual and you're trying to judge whether one or

16

another of individuals for the ­­ for places, the last

17

places would most benefit the class, the class as a

18

whole as a learning entity, then you can, as Bakke

19

indicates, take account of the fact that they may have

20

different backgrounds, which would contribute different

21

ideas.

It is not.

It simply says, in a situation of the

This is not the system that ­­ this system

So if ­­ it's very different.

Even if you

2

separate it from the necessity issue ­­ which is, of

3

course, a major issue in this case, but I'm assuming

4

your question ­­ that they've shown that they needed to

5

use race, there was no other way to do whatever they

6

were trying to do ­­ which isn't clear to me either ­­

7

so you have both the question of whether they've defined

8

a legitimate compelling interest; you have the question

9

of whether they've shown any necessity to use race.

10

if I ­­ even I put those aside, whether this is the

11

narrowly tailored vision that came out of Bakke is a

12

very serious question.

13

And I can ­­

14
15

It isn't.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's quite different.

You still haven't

answered why this is worse than Bakke.

16

MR. REIN:

I mean ­­

Because it ­­ it's not used to

17

build a class.

18

and to increase the number of minority admissions.

It's just used to create a racial plus

How is race given ­­

is leaders in diversity, not just of race, but of

were in the PAI before they added race.

5

demonstrated awards and success out of school;

6

overcoming obstacles, like a single­parent family.

7

Those were all part of the PAI before race was added.

Race was just tacked on, as they said, as a factor of a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in Grutter ­­ in both

10

Grutter and what Justice Powell said would be proper in

Bakke, race was a factor.

12

And that's why I'm finding it very hard to distinguish

what the university is doing, apart from the 10 percent

plan.

15

Race, itself, was a factor.

But let ­­ let me ask you about the 10

percent plan itself, because it seems to me that that is

so obviously driven by one thing only, and that thing is

race.

Solicitor General's attempted to do so by breaking down

2

the abstract goals into concrete objectives.

3

that certainly Grutter respects is, if you have studied

4

your campus and you believe there's an inadequate

5

exchange of views, and the minorities feel so isolated

6

they cannot properly bring to bear their perspective on

the campus, you can look at measures of how successful

They're having racial incidents

24

What more do they need?

25

MR. REIN:

Let me start with your first

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

concern, which is this classroom study.

2

First thing I would observe about that if I

3

were in their position, and I'm not, is that the second

4

study was done at a time when there were more minorities

5

admitted than the first study, and they claimed it went

6

backwards.

7

problem ­­ the necessity for using race could not be

8

demonstrated for that, because when you ­­

9

So that might tell me right away that the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

Because the ­­ the

10

necessity is not the necessity you're talking about.

11

It's the ­­ as I read it.

12

"critical mass" and so forth.

13

sort of you don't know what they're talking, but as I

14

read further into it, it becomes quite specific, that

15

is, 75 percent of the students are at this university

16

because they were in the top 10 percent of their class.

17

And it doesn't take long before students and faculty in

18

particular situations know who is who.

19

the students in that class are admitted; they're good

20

students, not in the top 10 percent on the basis of

21

leadership, activities, awards, work experience,

22

community service, family's economic status, school

23

status, family responsibilities, single­parent home,

24

languages other than English spoken at home, SAT score

25

relative to school's average and race occasionally, too.

I mean, you use words like

won't take long before students in a class see that in

3

that 25 percent, which means you aren't just in the top

4

10 percent of your class, in that 25 percent there is

5

hardly anybody who is African­American or Hispanic.

6

the ­­ and seven years of experience with that kind of

7

thing led the faculty at meetings, administrators, and

8

others to say, we should do more to see that that 25

9

percent has occasionally somebody who is a minority.

We're talking about that 25 percent.

10
11

And it

And

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does anybody but the

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what their program

faculty ­­

12
13

is.

14

And ­­ and ­­ and if you have to say, it seems to me,

15

why is that not a diversity­related judgment of what is

16

necessary?

It isn't something like critical mass, et cetera.

17
18

MR. REIN:

So, Justice Breyer, let me answer

that.

19

First of all, one thing your question

20

establishes quite clearly is if one assumes premises

21

from evidence that doesn't exist, you can draw

22

conclusions that are perhaps invalid.

23

So let me go back to ­­ to where you

24

started.

25

of the various PAI factors, which you read.

You say these people are admitted on the basis

That PAI is only part of the

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. REIN:

Well ­­

And it's not truly holistic

5

because in the holistic systems, you look at the person

6

as a whole.

7

and never come close to admission, because they use the

8

AI independently.

9

Here you could have the most wonderful PAI

So they're not admitted ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Every school is like that.

10

Every school in the country that's a college that I've

11

ever experienced is a combination of grades, class

12

position, and a lot of other things.

13

MR. REIN:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

But ­­
So I'm talking about people

15

who aren't admitted; 75 percent are, solely on the basis

16

of class ranking.

17

MR. REIN:

Yeah.

And ­­ and then you assume

18

that people could identify them one from another.

that Justice Alito's question indicates that this is the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the issue in this case

is not whether the University can have holistic review.

MR. REIN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Correct.
The issue is whether they

14

can have as a component of holistic review after they

15

have taken into account other characteristics that are

16

not dependent on race; they can add race as an

17

additional characteristic.

21

I mean, clearly one of the things they could do is ­­

example of Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke.

says that if you're looking at the whole person and

composition of this learning entity, you might choose A

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
To pick up on the questions this morning,

19

I'd like to focus on three things.

20

supports the Texas legislature's conclusion in 2009 that

21

the holistic plan at issue was a necessary complement to

22

the State's Top 10 Percent Law; two, why the record

23

shows that Texas's holistic policy has had a meaningful

24

impact on diversity at the University of Texas; and,

25

three, why the record absolutely forecloses any claim

Alderson Reporting Company

One, why the record

Official

39
1

that University of Texas has adopted a quota.

2

With respect to the first question of

3

necessity, there are three principle ways in which the

4

record shows that the plan at issue was a necessary

5

complement.

6

is a significant portion of the admissions pool, all

7

out­of­State students, all students from Texas high

8

schools that don't rank, some of the best high schools

9

in the State, and all students just below the top 10

First, as Justice Breyer mentioned, there

10

percent who are nevertheless great students who aren't

11

eligible for admission under the top 10 percent at all.

12

And the Fifth Circuit found that without the

13

consideration of race in the mix for those students,

14

admissions would approach an all white enterprise.

15

Secondly, the record in this case shows ­­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. GARRE:

22

That's right, which is an

important component of the class, Your Honor.

20
21

Just the

admissions of people beyond the top 10 percent?

18
19

Excuse me.

Second, and I think this goes to your point,
Justice ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, on that point, can you

23

determine which of the holistic admittees would not have

24

been admitted if race was not added to the ­­ to the

25

determination?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

MR. GARRE:

Okay.

This goes to the

2

meaningful impact point, and I think there are several

3

ways to address it, Justice Alito.

4

First, what you can do is you can look in

5

the increase in African­American and Hispanic holistic

6

admissions after the consideration of race was added.

7

And what you find is, is that in each year, 2005, 2006,

8

2007, the percentage of African­American and Hispanics

9

admitted and enrolled under the holistic plan grew.

10

In

fact, there was a 70 percent ­­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's not really my

12

question.

13

person, can you tell whether that person was admitted

14

because ­­ solely because of race?

15

would not have been admitted were it not for the fact

16

that the person was an African­American or Hispanic?

17

My question was if you look at an individual

MR. GARRE:

Whether that person

Your Honor, I think, given the

18

contextualized and individualized nature of that

19

inquiry, that's going to be difficult.

20

record nevertheless answers your question because you

21

can show a marked increase in diversity under the plan

22

at issue.

23

record confirms that holistic admissions of

24

African­Americans and Hispanics increased markedly in

25

each year.

But I think the

I just ­­ I've just explained to you how the

Alderson Reporting Company

If you look at student body diversity

2

overall, African­American enrollment increased by two,

3

doubled from 2002 to 2008 from about 3 percent to about

4

6 percent.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

What ­­ one of the things I

6

find troubling about your argument is the suggestion

7

that there is something deficient about the

8

African­American students and the Hispanic students who

9

are admitted under the top 10 percent plan.

MR. GARRE:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.
It's ­­ really it's based on

a terrible stereotyping that ­­

15

MR. GARRE:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

They're not change

And I don't know what the basis for that is.

12

14

They're not

Your Honor, it's ­­
What is the basis for

that ­­

18

MR. GARRE:

It's exactly the opposite.

This

19

Court has said time and again that you can't assume that

20

minorities think alike just because they have the same

21

skin color.

22

considers ­­ it takes into account the fact that people

23

who come from different experiences, different

24

backgrounds are going to have different contributions to

25

the class.

What the University of Texas does is it

If you had the situation where all the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

out­of­State admits or most of the out­of­State admits

2

were coming predominantly from western States, then the

3

University of Texas and any university would try to get

4

out­of­State admits from other parts of the country

5

because it would want the ­­ both perspectives.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But ­­ maybe I

7

misapprehended either the question or the answer.

8

you're the one that says race can be relevant.

9

in answer to Justice Alito's question, you say, oh,

10

that's stereotyping.

11

inconsistent.

12

MR. GARRE:

But

And then

It seems to me that you're

No.

What stereotyping, Your

13

Honor, is saying, that just because you get a sufficient

14

number of blacks or Hispanics under the 10 percent plan

15

means that you can't look at the class holistically and

16

say, we're not getting a variety of perspectives among

17

African­Americans or Hispanics.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

But what is the basis

19

for saying that?

20

kind of the assumption that if the ­­ if a student ­­ if

21

a black student or a Hispanic student is admitted as

22

part of the top 10 percent plan, it has to be because

23

that student didn't have to compete against very many

24

whites and ­­ and Asians.

That's what I don't understand.

In ­­ in the high school

operates.

5

response to Hopwood, and there's nothing ­­ there's no

6

challenge to the law in this case that admits many

7

well­deserving students.

8

that the way that the Top 10 Percent Law admits minority

9

students is by admitting those students from the

10

lower­performing, racially identifiable schools.

11

It's based on the undeniable fact

The Top 10 Percent Law was enacted in

But the fact is, is that ­­

And the way ­­ the reason we know that is

12

because if you look at the bill analysis decided by

13

Justice Ginsburg in her dissent the last time we were

14

here, that analysis specifically says on page 4,

15

"Because of the persistence of segregation in this

16

State, minority students will be admitted under the top

17

10 percent plan."

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't doubt that that is

19

one of the things that it does, and I would have thought

20

that that would be something that you would regard as

21

beneficial.

3

Now, words No. 2:

appendix.

13

Let me give you some ­­ a few pieces of that.

14

It's elaborated by the deposition testimony.

Number one is, is the University made clear

15

it was pursuing the educational benefits of diversity in

16

the broad sense specifically recognized by this Court.

17

This is on pages 1 through 3 of the Supplemental Joint

18

Appendix.

19

Number two, the University made clear that

educational objectives.

diversity suffered at the University of Texas under the

evidence of glaring racial isolation, certainly in the

classroom where 90 percent of the classes, the most

14

common size, are zero or one African­American ­­

15

And

Well, on that subject, I

don't know of any ­­ you haven't mentioned in your

18

increase racial diversity at the classroom level, other

19

than this admissions program.

Alderson Reporting Company

And I

Official

52

I can tell, to measure that.

2

MR. GARRE:

Let me answer that in two ways.

3

One, doubling the enrollment of African­American

4

students, which happened from 2002 to 2008, is going to

5

increase diversity in the classroom.

6

at that, and it has.

7

And we've looked

Secondly, with respect to diversity among

consideration of where ­­ which schools students are

10

admitted to as well.

11

concern as well.

So its policy addresses that

12

But what the record does show, Your Honor,

13

conclusively, I think, is that diversity languished at

14

the University of Texas in the period where we had

15

race­blind holistic admissions plus the top 10 percent,

16

and that the plan at issue here was necessary to

17

there's something deficient about the top 10 admittees,

MR. GARRE:
there, Your Honor.

There's a different breakdown

But I think there's two dimensions

to this diversity issue.

11

isolation that existed, particularly among

12

African­Americans.

13

One is just the glaring racial

And then two is an effort, through the

14

addition of holistic review, to admit minorities from

15

different viewpoints, experiences, and perspectives.

16

That gets back right to the core of the essence of the

17

diversity embraced by this Court in Bakke.

18

If you look at the Harvard brief in the

19

Bakke case, page 17, it specifically says, "Our

20

interests in the educational benefits of diversity would

21

not be met if all of minority students were ­­ were

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is it ­­ what is it ­­

2

have you looked at the top 10 percent admittees, for

3

example, to see how many of them are leaders, which is

4

certainly ­­ and certainly a legitimate factor to look

5

for, students who are leaders.

6

At ­­ do you say, well, there are ­­ there

7

are just not very many leaders here; these are students

8

who all they do is study.

9

as far as I can tell.

10

MR. GARRE:

There's no evidence of that

I don't think it's ­­ it's

11

seriously debatable, but if we need evidence on this,

12

let us put it into the record that a class selected by

13

the holistic consideration of numerous factors is going

14

to be more diverse in a way that promotes the

15

University's educational interests than a class selected

16

by a single factor.

whether that group was diverse in and of itself, whether

you had enough people within that group that were change

6

of the class that it selects through a facially

7

race­neutral system, the Top 10 Percent Law.

we're here debating is whether or not it can complement

that policy by taking race into account for a quarter.

10

Because the University of Texas has

And what

Now, it may actually be that the university

11

could achieve more diversity through the pure

12

Grutter­Bakke­style plan, but we think, working with the

13

Texas legislature, we've come up with a hydrid ­­ hybrid

14

plan that works together to both ­­ to both address this

15

Court's concerns about using race too much in the

process, and addressing University of Texas's

appreciated by Bakke.

If you exclude race from that mix, you not

2

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

3
4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

5

I'd like to make a point about the

6

compelling­interest inquiry in light of what this Court

7

said previously in Fisher, and then I'd like to make

8

point about the process aspect of the narrow­tailoring

9

inquiry in light of what this Court said in Fisher,

10

which I believe Justice Kennedy will address your

11

concerns about whether race is determinative here.

12

then I'd like to move on to what I think this case comes

13

down to, which is whether the University has made a

14

sufficient showing of need to consider race in ­­ in its

15

process.

And

16

But before I make any of those points, Mr.

17

19

You're right ­­ you're

17

right that you can't tell for sure, but you do have a

18

pretty good benchmark, I think, given that you have a

19

number of years without considering race where 141 was

20

the high­water mark.

21

And so I do ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, wait a minute.

The

22

next two years you recited it was going up, even when

23

race was considered.

24

GENERAL VERRILLI:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.
So you could have said

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

there ­­ there is a fluctuation before then, when race

2

wasn't considered.

3

That might have gone up, too.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, it went ­­ before

4

they started considering race, it went up and down,

5

frankly.

a consistent trajectory in those numbers.

7

But 141 was the high­water mark.

JUSTICE ALITO:

There wasn't

Well, there's an aspect of

8

the holistic review process done at the University of

9

Texas which may militate against the admission of

10

African­American and Hispanic students for a ­­ an

11

ostensibly race­neutral reason, and that is, that as I

12

understand it, standardized test scores count pretty

13

heavily in that process.

14

One of the things the University says it's

15

looking for is students with high SAT scores who are not

16

in the top 10 percent of their class.

17

many who think that SAT scores and ACT scores are

18

culturally biased.

19

you might not have the numbers that you just recited.

20

And there are

So if you put less emphasis on that,

Well, it's rather strange that we ­­ we

21

construct the process that may disadvantage

22

African­American and Hispanic students for an ostensibly

23

race­neutral reason.

24

a special factor to counteract that.

25

So then we have to add race in as

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It's ­­ or I guess what

Alderson Reporting Company

I'd say about that, Your Honor, is that in Grutter, what

2

the Court specifically held was that the University is

allowed to make those kinds of judgments in seeking to

advance multiple objectives to maintain an academic

5

environment of excellence, and to diversify the student

body, both.

And I thought the record showed that the

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So I ­­ I'm not sure what

23

the answer to that is, Your Honor, but this all goes to

24

the compelling­interest inquiry, and let me focus on

25

that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

73
1

What the ­­ what the Court said last time

2

around is to satisfy the compelling­interest inquiry,

3

the University has got to articulate a reasoned,

4

principled explanation for its decision to consider the

5

educational benefits of diversity in a matter that this

6

Court has found to be constitutional and substantial.

7

The University of Texas has met that

8

standard, has articulated exactly the same educational

9

benefits of diversity at exactly the same level of

10

specificity that this Court held constituted a

11

compelling interest in the Grutter case at page 330.

12

It's exactly the same.

13

And the ­­ the principal argument that my

14

friend Mr. Rein makes in challenging that is, well,

15

actually a lot of that is post hoc rationalization, in

16

particular, the effort to find whether you call it

17

qualitative diversity, diversity within diversity is all

18

post hoc rationalization, that is simply not so.

19

If you look at page 1 of the Supplemental

20

Joint Appendix, the first page of the 2004 Proposal, the

21

University specifically says that what it's trying to

22

accomplish is to create a diversity of perspectives

And unlike in Michigan, the ­­ there ­­ the

That opinion by seven people reflected no one's views

respect to narrow tailoring because they did compare the

2

students one after another and use race as a plus

factor.

4

Now, what is there in this record that will

5

support the view that what Texas has done in respect to

6

narrow tailoring is no worse than, perhaps even better

7

than, what happened in Grutter or Bakke?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So I ­­ I would point

Your Honor specifically to the declaration at pages 483a

10

and 484 ­­ and 484a of the Joint Appendix of the

11

admissions director, in which he explains the way race

12

is considered in the University of Texas system.

13

that explanation says expressly, at page 483, that race

14

is considered in exactly the same manner, and given

15

exactly the same consideration as every other special

16

circumstance's factor that the university considers as

17

part of its holistic review.

18

And

That ­­ I think that shows you that actually

19

you know more about the way this program works than you

20

did about the program that you affirmed in Grutter, and

21

you have assurance based on that, and nothing in the

22

record contradicts it that that's the way it operates.

Circuit, oh, it's a necessary complement.

What does

When you really look what the Fifth Circuit

said, they said it's based on two assumptions:

11

How do you know that a Hispanic or an

12

African­American student can't be in the Top Ten at what

13

they call an integrated, high­performing high school?

14

That's a stereotypical assumption.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

you're saying, basically, is, is this is what the Fifth

Oh, but there is ­­

­­ that Justice ­­
Mr. Rein ­­

­­ Alito wants to rely

on.

14

Let me finish my point.

15

He's right.

For their educational needs,

16

there are competing criteria.

17

certain SAT, or whatever that's called, AI index, that

18

has to be high because of the quality they want to keep

19

the school at.

20

some levels, because the difference in numbers are high.

21

They need to keep a

So if you have something like this,

22

you're ­­ what you're saying, basically, is, and what

23

he's proposing, is change your educational needs across

24

the board, and focus in only on race, and make sure that

25

your school is black, Hispanic, or whatever on numbers

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

93
1

that are going to reduce its educational quality.

2
3
4

That's basically what you're arguing, isn't
it?
MR. REIN:

No.

And ­­ and to be fair, I

5

mean, the first thing I was just pointing out is that to

6

get to the conclusion of the Fifth Circuit, you have to

7

first assume the pattern of admits in the Top Ten, where

8

they come from, which was never established in the

9

record, never studied.

10

And the second is that you have to assume

11

that those coming from ­­ all students coming from these

12

integrated, high­performing high schools don't include,

13

in their Top 10 percent, any minority.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. REIN:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

­­ the school doesn't

have enough ­­
MR. REIN:

21

What we know is ­­

That's what he assumes.

18

20

Why?

Justice Sotomayor ­­
­­ no matter what it

does, it doesn't have enough numbers of black people.
MR. REIN:

That ­­ that comes back to the

fundamental point.

23

If we're just talking numbers, then you have

24

to show the compelling need for more numbers, so that ­­

25

one of the reasons for defining your compelling need is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

94
1

that you have to then look at necessity in terms of the

2

need.

3

So as in Grutter, what they said was we have

4

insufficient numbers of minorities to provoke the

5

appropriate dialogue.

6

whole, we think we can do better if we introduce

7

different points of view.

8

it's a small class.

9

When we look at the class as a

It's very individualized;

So you can then say, increasing numbers ­­

10

which they were certainly after, you know, from three to

11

14 ­­ will meet that compelling need.

12

Since they never bothered to administer, you

13

know, to define the needs, it's really hard to say what

14

they were after and why numbers would or would not

15

satisfy, and whether the numbers they were generating,

16

which included 15 percent of the so­called holistic

17

admits so it wasn't all white enterprise, why that

18

wouldn't work.

19

The key point is, you have to come to the

20

Court with the record.

21

because that would say do what you want, and when the

22

time comes, make it up.

23

litigate.

24
25

You can't make it up later,

That's not ­­ no way to

And in this case they said, we're ready for
summary judgment; we've put in everything we need.
