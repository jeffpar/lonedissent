ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. KIMBERLY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. KIMBERLY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Section 2284(a) states in plain terms that a

11

district court of three judges shall be convened when an

12

action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the

13

apportionment of congressional districts.

14

Section 2284(b) lays out the procedure for calling a

15

three­judge court when the circumstances identified in

16

2284 are satisfied.

17

It ­­ it reads, quote, "Upon the filing of a

18

request for three judges, the judge to whom the request

19

is presented shall, unless he determines that three

20

judges are not required, immediately notify the chief

21

judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other

22

judges."

23

Now, although that language did not appear

24

in the statute until the 1976 amendments, it was no more

25

than a congressional recognition and codification of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

what was then by settled ­­ what was by then settled

2

practice, that a complaint covered by 2284(a) would

3

have, initially, to be referred to a single judge, that

4

the litigants then would have to file a request for a

5

three­judge district court, and in turn that the single

6

judge would have to determine whether three judges were,

7

in fact, required.

8

Now, at the time that Congress enacted that

9

long­standing practice in the 1976 amendments to the

10

Act, this Court's precedents had made clear that one

11

basis upon which three judges are, quote, "not required"

12

is when the claim is constitutionally insubstantial.

13

Congress is presumed to have been aware

14

of ­­ of this Court's precedents so holding, and in the

15

absence of a contrary indication ­­ and here there is

16

none ­­ to have intended that interpretation of the

17

words "not required" to be incorporated into the

18

statute.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if it's perfectly clear

20

that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment?

21

the State legislature goes back to its pre Reynolds v.

3

therefore, isn't the kind of case that has to be

precedent.

were inclined to do that.

not to adopt Respondents' position.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could the Respondents

argue that, in the light of Iqbal and Twombly, Goosby

19

should be reconsidered, and the Federal court should

20

have some ­­ district court, single judge should have

21

some more authority?

22

do you think?

23

Or does that work the other way,

MR. KIMBERLY:

I ­­ I think it works the

24

other way.

25

that argument, because again we're dealing here with a

I would be surprised to see Respondents make

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11

statute, with statutory language that says when a

2

complaint is filed challenging the constitutionality of

3

congressional districts, that a three­judge court shall

4

be convened.

5

And then in (b), using the word "required,"

6

it ­­ essentially Respondents' view is that the words

7

"shall appearing" in 2284(a), actually means "may," and

8

that the rule "required appearing" in 2284(b) actually

9

means "permitted," and that a single district judge, in

10

their view, can elect whether or not to convene a

11

three­judge court if he or she would, in his or her

12

discretion, prefer to keep the case for him or herself.

13

Would ­­ could the single judge proceed with the

MR. KIMBERLY:

6

that ­­ that the ­­ the judge would be without ­­ that a

7

single judge would be without power to consider the

8

merits in the case covered by the statute.

9

But I should say that that also isn't

10

necessarily a question that's presented here because,

11

even if it's just a claims­processing rule, it's still a

12

mandatory claims­processing rule.

13

the Respondents had said indicates that when a request

14

is filed, the district judge would be empowered

15

nevertheless to disregard the request and ­­ and

nevertheless keep the case for himself.

2

MR. KIMBERLY:

To be clear, I don't think a

3

single judge does have to decide the jurisdictional

4

question.

5

merits have to go to a three­judge district court.

6

don't think the Court has to say anything more about the

7

statute than that in this case because, on the face of

8

it, what the district court here did was enter judgment

9

under Rule 12(b)(6).

But there was a ­­ there

12

was a change in '76, and that's when they put in "upon

13

14

that it isn't a jurisdictional question, because if a

party has to request it, it normally follows if a party

16

doesn't request it, it's waived.

statute.

was viewed as an anti­plaintiff provision.

19

It was certainly the

The idea was that single judges were too

20

quickly issuing injunctions, you know, blocking the

21

State enactments, and they thought that would be less

22

likely if you had three judges.

still true today, but it certainly was when the law was

passed.

25

MR. KIMBERLY:

I'm not sure if that's

4

It was not

That much is made clear by the legislative

5

history of the Voting Rights Act, which is one of those

6

other statutes that provides ­­ statutes that provides

7

for three­judge­court review beyond 2284.

8

The legislative history in that ­­ in that,

9

with respect to that statute, was clear, that indeed,

10

three­judge district courts were more likely to grant

11

relief to plaintiffs than were single judges, which is

12

in part what explained why Congress, in that Act,

13

provided for three­judge­court review.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And plaintiffs liked it

15

because you could skip over the court of appeals and go

16

right to this Court, and on appeal rather than

17

certiorari.

18

MR. KIMBERLY:

That's right.

And so I think

19

in that respect, Respondents reading the statute is also

20

quite inconsistent with the well­understood purposes of

21

the statute.

22

merits judgments and cases covered by the Act, which

23

after the 1976 amendments are quite narrow and cover

24

only particularly politically sensitive and important

25

cases, receive as quick a final decision before this

Among them, key among them, to ensure that

Alderson Reporting Company

2

Court as possible.
On Respondent's reading of the statute, a

3

single judge can keep the merits for him or herself and

4

interpose the court of appeals in the process.

5

What's more, their reading of the statute

6

also creates really difficult jurisdictional problems on

7

appellate review.

8

If ­­ if a single­judge district court can

9

grant a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6) and it goes

10

before the court of appeals and the court of appeals

11

reverses, the upshot is that, well, three judges were in

12

fact required after all.

13

The case then has to get referred to a

14

three­judge district court.

15

whether the three­judge district court would be bound by

16

law of the case on the 12(b)(6) question by the decision

17

of the court of appeals.

But it's not clear, then,

18

If ­­ if it is bound, that's ­­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. SULLIVAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

17

In 1976, Congress considerably narrowed the

18

circumstances that would call for the procedural device

19

of a three­judge court.

20

down of the three­judge statute, Congress, for the first

21

time, authorized a single­district judge to, quote,

22

"determine that three judges are not required."

23

And as part of that pairing

For three reasons, this Court should affirm

24

that that authorization permits the single district

25

judge to dismiss a complaint that, on its face, fails to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

satisfy Rule 8 and Rule 12(b)(6) as required in all

2

civil actions.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I go back to

4

something you just said?

5

word "required" was in the statute.

6

introduced in '76; it was there before.

Because I thought that the

7

MR. SULLIVAN:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

It wasn't

Well ­­
Required to be heard by a

three­judge court.

10

MR. SULLIVAN:

But it wasn't for an

11

authorization for a single judge.

12

upon the filing of the request for injunctive relief,

13

the three­judge court was required to be convened, and

14

so the express language of the statute did not have a

15

provision for the single judge to make that call.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In the prior statute,

On what basis are ­­ it

17

sounds to me that you're giving a meaning to not

18

required that was different to the meaning we gave to it

19

pre­1976.

20

Am I correct?
MR. SULLIVAN:

I ­­ I don't think that's

21

necessarily the case.

22

it didn't have a set meaning as plaintiffs ­­

I think not required meant that

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

adjectives, descriptors from our case law:

25

"Insubstantial," "wholly insubstantial," "frivolous,"

I ­­ he took out the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

"obviously or essentially frivolous."

2

MR. SULLIVAN:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4
5

I mean ­­

But that ­­
­­ that's very different

than a 12(b)(3) motion.
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor,

6

that ­­ those words appear, but in the prior case law

7

before 1976, this Court had, in two important cases,

8

permitted a district judge to adjudicate the entire case

9

notwithstanding the presence of a substantial claim

10

raised by the plaintiff.

11

the Hagans v Lavine case cited by Petitioners.

12

And those cases are Bailey and

There, Hagans v. Lavine, there was no

13

question there was a substantial equal protection claim.

14

The district judge perceived that there's this

15

preemption claim, and I think I can get rid of the case

16

by ruling on the preemption claim, which is exactly what

17

the district judge did.

18

And this Court affirmed that that was the

19

correct procedure; that there was no reason to trouble

20

the three­judge court if there was a statutory claim

21

that could be resolved and rendered unnecessary to

22

address the equal protection clause.

23

So the idea that there was this set

24

understanding that any time there's a substantial claim

25

it's off limits to a single district judge is simply not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

borne out by this Court's pre­1976 precedent.

2

there's more at work in that precedent.

3

So

Indeed, for those who will consult

4

legislative history, the Senate Report 94204 has a

5

heading under uncertainties in the prior law, and the

6

first item is A, whether or not a three­judge court

7

should be convened was the first of the several

8

uncertainties that the Senate noted in its report.

9

So the idea that Petitioners want to say

10

that by saying "not required" in the statute, Congress

11

intended to adopt a certain subset of this Court's prior

12

jurisprudence is not borne out by ­­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, they ­­ they want to

14

raise about as important a question as you can imagine.

15

They want to say, reading Vieth, that the State

16

legislators are forbidden to draw district boundaries

17

the way that has been done here.

18

basic claim.

19

congressional districts and legislative districts

20

throughout the nation.

21

I take it that's their

And if they are right, that would affect

So what reason could Congress have had for

22

saying, although we want three­judge courts to decide

23

these kind of cases generally, where the single­most

24

important issue that could possibly be raised ­­ I

25

exaggerate only slightly ­­ is raised, that kind of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

issue is for a single judge?

2

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, Congress, if it had

3

looked back at this Court's case law, would have seen

4

that this Court regularly denied three­judge courts even

5

where there was an important issue such as when the

6

preemption was the issue.

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you want to give me a

list of those cases with ­­ I'm going to continue it.

Preemption cases ­­

MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes.

Swift ­­ Swift and

Company ­­

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

MR. SULLIVAN:

Answer Justice Breyer.

So the ­­ the Court's

13

concern, it was always a narrow interpretation of the

14

statute for very important reasons.

15

minimize the dislocation of the lower Federal courts'

16

functioning and structure, which always happens when you

17

have to bring in two extra judges.

18

control this Court's mandatory appellate docket.

19

And that is to

And secondly, to

So those are always at work when the Court

20

was reading the statute.

21

on page 5, the Senate report acknowledges this narrow

22

reading without disavowing it or instructing this Court

23

to do otherwise.

24
25

And Congress knew this.

And

So the statute always was read not in the
most embracing terms, as it said in Swift & Company v.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

Wickham at page 126, not in the most embracing terms,

2

but in restrictive ­­ in a restrictive way because of

3

the important concerns of judicial administration that

4

were at stake, but also to best serve the historical

5

purpose, which is to protect States from the improvident

6

injunction by a single judge.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, haven't they

8

strayed from that ­­ or Congress has, because Congress

9

said you also get a three­judge court if you're

10

attacking a Federal statute, right?

11

the concern about enjoining State statutes.

12

were trying to enjoin a Federal statute, you could also

13

get a three­judge court, right?

14

State­protective interest involved in that.

It started out with

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
But now you're suggesting

that you're not relying on that, that you're saying that

is the amendments that we pointed out in our brief

are ­­ were significant changes in ­­ in the structure

14

and meaning of the statute.

15

Petitioners' argument that this Court can simply look at

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, you know, I'm trying to

provide value now in addition to what we had in the

5

brief.

6

(Laughter.)

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

For my edification, what

8

are the cases ­­ I know Bailey is one.

9

other ones you're relying on?

10

MR. SULLIVAN:

What are the

Well, in Swift v. Wickham is

11

the best exposition of what this narrow construction or

12

restrictive construction is about.

13

said in the prior statute, "On grounds of

14

unconstitutionality."

15

The words clearly

And this Court read that phrase not to

16

include a very important clause of the Constitution, the

17

supremacy clause, because it was important to keep it

18

narrow and not to open the floodgates to every

19

preemption challenge that would come down, even though

20

those challenges are very important and often much more

21

devastating to the State than a constitutional claim

22

could be.

23

That's an example.
In Gonzalez, this Court read the phrase in

24

28 U.S. 1253, which is the direct appeal provision ­­

25

"orders granting or denying an injunction," this Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

read to not include any denial of an injunction that

2

would have been a sound basis for not convening a

3

three­judge court in the first place.

4

And the Court phrased it that broadly to

5

include whatever basis there might be to not convene a

6

three­judge court.

7

appeal, which is a very important part of this whole

8

statutory scheme.

9

That means you don't get the direct

It became more important with the rise of

10

the reapportionment cases, which, by the way, the reason

11

you don't see any old reapportionment cases in the case

12

law is they would have been foreclosed by this Court's

13

precedent until Baker v. Carr.

14

But with the rise of those, the part of the

15

structure ­­ not the three­judge so much, but it was the

16

direct appeal that became more important to the States

17

to protect them, as ­­ as was spoken to by the assistant

18

U.S. attorney general Robert Dickson who testified.

19

we quote his testimony at page 30, talking about, but

20

for that direct appeal and the ability to get an

21

immediate stay from this Court, entire elections would

22

have had to be conducted under plans that were adopted

23

by district courts, contrary to what the legislature had

24

provided, and it was very important to have access to

25

this Court to get that stay and not to have the entire

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

31
1

election disrupted by that order.

2

The idea that Petitioner insists on that the

3

insubstantiality rule is not a merits­based test is just

4

obviously can't be true, because you have got to know

5

what the merits are before you know it's insubstantial.

6

I know this Court's precedent has treated it as a

7

jurisdictional matter.

8

really doesn't meet the set of tests that Justice

9

Ginsburg laid out for the Court in Arbaugh of what's

10

But I would submit that it ­­ it

jurisdictional and what is not.

11

And the idea that there's a clear division

12

between insubstantially and failure to state a claim is

13

not borne out.

14

Petitioner in their brief at page 23, Kalson v.

15

Paterson, the 2008 Second Circuit case illustrates that,

16

because there a single­district judge is deemed able to

17

decide it because it's insubstantial, even though the

18

court acknowledges that the theory is not foreclosed by

19

precedent.

And in one of the cases cited by the

23

Second Circuit, as in most other circuits, is analyzed

24

exactly like a Rule 12(b)(6) failure to state a claim

25

motion.

And it rules, it affirms the grant of a

Alderson Reporting Company

13

whole matter under a 12(b)(6) analysis, which is maybe a

little more detailed than the Second Circuit in

It's just a laughing stock of a case, given our

5

the Court adopts the Federal rules, and all ­­ all

6

district judges are bound for them.

7

If a district judge is entitled to grant

8

relief, as under the Bailey case, it seems reasonable to

9

allow that judge to determine that a complaint on its

10

face is legally sufficient, as the court would in any

11

other case.

12

These ­­ these rules are binding, unless you

13

can find in the statute a reason that compels the

14

district judge not to comply with the civil ­­ the rules

15

of civil procedure, then the district judge is in his or

16

her rights?

17
18
19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you say "required in the

statute" means "states a claim"?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, I think that it

20

could ­­ it incorporates that understanding as much as

21

it would incorporate the insubstantiality, because both

22

are presumptions that courts rely on.

23

going to proceed, pass a motion to dismiss, certainly

24

not under Iqbal and Twombly, unless it satisfies Rule 8.

25

That's just a basic understanding of every district

Alderson Reporting Company

A case is not

Official

court in the land.

2

the cases are that important and they're going to

3

require two extra judges and a direct appeal to this

4

Court, that a legally insufficient complaint that

5

otherwise could not get past the threshold of the

6

courthouse is going to get an automatic direct appeal to

7

this Court.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So let ­­ let's assume you

have a district judge who says it fails to state a

10

claim.

And it seems strange that, if ­­ if

And ­­ what does the plaintiff do?

MR. SULLIVAN:

Where does

To the court of appeals, as

in every other case.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it goes all the way up,

15

and if ­­ if he loses in the court of appeals, he tries

16

to come up here, right?

17

state a claim.

18

and you begin all over again with a three­judge court,

19

right?

And we finally decide it did

Then what happens?

20

MR. SULLIVAN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

Yes, Your Honor.
Wow.

Wow, that's ­­ I

2

MR. SULLIVAN:

But ­­ but I ­­ I understand

3

your reaction, but I think that comes ­­ when you have a

4

departure from the norm, as the three­judge statute

5

creates, you're going to have some situations that may

6

be a little bit stickier than otherwise that you have

7

had in a normal functioning of the content.

8

happened.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's

I mean, the other

10

alternative is it's a three­judge district court, and

11

then we have to take it on the merits.

12

serious problem because there are a lot of cases that

13

come up in three­judge district courts that would be the

14

kind of case ­­ I speak for myself, anyway ­­ that we

15

might deny cert in, to let the issue percolate.

16

with the three­judge district court, no, we have to

17

decide it on the merits.

18

MR. SULLIVAN:

I mean, that's a

And now

Well, you had seven more

19

direct appeals from Maryland, as we cite in our ­­ in

20

our brief, that ­­ the cases we've had in recent years

21

that were dismissed by a single judge, they would have

22

all come here.

23

direct appeals, perhaps?

24

these cases are filed in other States.

25

And we're one State times 50 ­­ 400 more
I don't know how frequently

But that was a concern that ­­ that was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

always lurking in all the cases prior that this Court

2

decided before 1976 and was acknowledged in the report

3

that there is this concern to control this Court's

4

mandatory docket, which Congress cares deeply about,

5

because they took away the direct appeal of

6

constitutional claims that would come up from the

7

courts.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:
Congress.

10

We care even more than

Trust me.
MR. SULLIVAN:

I hope you care deeply and ­­

11

and deeply enough to ­­ to affirm this reasonable

12

interpretation.

of ­­ of this Court and also all the other litigants as

well.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. KIMBERLY

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

21

MR. KIMBERLY:

22

First, a comment about Swift v. Wickham.

Just a few quick points.

23

This is a case that we addressed on page 5 in footnote 1

24

in our reply brief.

25

The holding in that case was simply that a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

preemption claim is not a constitutional claim within

2

the meaning of the statute.

3

inconsistent about that holding with our position before

4

this Court.

There's nothing

5

Second, with respect to the ­­

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Explain why that's so.

Why

7

is ­­ why is that so clear that ­­ that it's frivolous,

8

you know?

9

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I ­­ I don't ­­ that's

10

not the holding in the case.

11

the ­­ the ­­ in order to have a three­judge court, you

12

have to bring a constitutional claim, and the Court's

13

holding in that case was that a preemption claim,

14

although it involves a question under the supremacy

15

clause, is ultimately really a statutory claim.

16

it just isn't of the sort that Congress meant to ­­ to

17

go before a three­judge court, as a matter of

18

interpretation of the statute.

19
20
21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm sorry.

I just ­­

And so

And it doesn't matter

whether that's frivolous or not?
MR. KIMBERLY:

That's right.

Yes.

It ­­

22

it's a completely different holding.

23

whatever to do with the question whether a substantial

24

claim has to go before the three­judge court.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It has nothing

Does it happen often that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

a single judge will say there are three issues here; one

2

would definitely involve a three­judge court, but the

3

previous are ones that I can reach, and so I will reach

4

those first.

5

Does that happen very often?

6

MR. KIMBERLY:

Not so far we're aware of.

7

We ­­ we are aware that it has happened.

8

seem to be a frequent occurrence.

9

It doesn't

The Third Circuit in Page indicated that

10

when that happens, because the statute applies to the

11

action, that the entire action must go.

12

Now, if I could say something briefly about

13

purpose.

14

suggested that the sole purpose here for the statute was

15

to protect States from improvident grants of

16

injunctions.

17

in Section 2253, to see ­­ which is the ­­ the provision

18

that provides for appellate review over judgments of

19

three­judge district courts ­­ you'd expect to see

20

mandatory and direct review before this Court only from

21

final judgments of courts granting injunctions.

22

fact, what 2253 says in express terms is that there's a

23

right of immediate appeal before this Court from both

24

grants and denials of relief in cases heard by the two

25

district courts.

My friend on the other side of the podium

If that were the case, you would expect,

Alderson Reporting Company

But in

Official

42
1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To ­­ to ­­ to say

2

otherwise, we ­­ we would have to say that you get ­­

3

you get no appeal in one category of case.

4

I ­­ you know, I'm ­­ I'm not sure it ­­ it would comply

5

with due process to ­­ to have a judgment from which

6

there is no appeal.

7

MR. SULLIVAN:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

I ­­ I ­­

Well, I think ­­
And that's what you're

saying, that ­­ that Congress would have provided for no

10

appeal whatever if you ­­ if you ­­ if ­­ if ­­ if the

11

State wins.

12

No appeal for the plaintiffs.
MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I ­­ I ­­ I think

13

Respondents' position is if relief can be denied, it may

14

be granted.

15

entered by a single district judge and you'd get 1291

16

review before a court of appeals.

17

That ­­ an order of that sort may be

Our ­­ our ­­ our point is only that, if the

18

statutory purpose were only to protect States from

19

grants of injunctions, you would see ­­ and that single

20

judges in turn could decide everything else, you would

21

not see in 1253, which provides for immediate appeal to

22

this Court from judgments of three­district court ­­

23

three­judge district courts, the right of appeal from a

24

denial of relief.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I ­­ as far ­­ as far as I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

understand it, his strongest argument on the other side

2

would roughly go ­­ he didn't put it this way ­­ like

3

this:

4

On your side is the fact, well, why wouldn't

5

a three­judge court decide a very important question of

6

law in this area?

7

On the other side of it is that, well, you

8

just have left, in three­judge courts primarily, almost

9

exclusively, reapportionment issues, which are specially

10

political.

11

And to put these all, you know, they are

12

very ­­ because of the opinions you point out in Vieth,

13

there's a huge variation of all kinds of different legal

14

claims that might be made.

15

cases where this Court should be careful as to when and

16

how and which it enters in which order, i.e.,

17

discretion, if we accept your view, that set of cases

18

where we should be particularly careful as to how we

19

proceed will be the set of cases where we have no choice

20

and we have to take immediately whatever variations on

21

the theme of disproportionate gerrymandering, da da da,

22

whatever order they happen to arise and whenever they

23

happen to arise, because we have no choice.

24
25

MR. KIMBERLY:
that.

And if there is a set of

So I have two responses to

The first is it's reflected in the congressional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

record and the testimony before Congress that, indeed,

2

Congress was quite concerned with the political

3

sensitivity of these cases.

4

The way that Congress decided to deal with

5

that political sensitivity was to ensure that, in the

6

first instance, these cases are decided by a panel of

7

three judges, as ­­ as Judge Henry Friendly, in his

8

testimony before the 92nd Congress, indicated there.

9

The concern was to ensure that adherents of

10

more than one political party were deciding these cases

11

because, not only to ensure greater deliberation and

12

accuracy and decision making, but also because it might

13

be unseemly to allow a single judge to decide such a

14

politically­sensitive case where it might appear ­­

15

whether or not it actually is true ­­ where it might

16

appear to the public that his or her own political

17

ideologies and predilections ­­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So now you have ­­

19

now you have cases quite often, particularly in the most

20

sensitive ones, decided by a vote of two to one.

21

don't know how that ­­ how that particular answer is

22

very responsive to the concern that Justice Breyer has

23

pointed out, which ­­ which is one I share.

24
25

MR. KIMBERLY:

So I

Well, so that leads to me to

the second half of my response, and that is that in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

majority of these cases that make it before this Court

2

on mandatory review, the Court generally enters a

3

summary affirmance and doesn't note probable

4

jurisdiction and take full briefing.

5

When the Court affirms on the basis ­­

6

affirms on the ­­ without taking full argument and

7

briefing, there's a limited presidential effect to those

8

decisions.

9

decision ­­ that they're binding in the same way as a

10

It is not binding the same way that a full

decision following full briefing ­­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, to go back to your ­­
Just to follow up:

13

In ­­ in recent years, is it true that in

14

reapportionment cases, the majority of the way we've

15

handled direct appeals has been summarily?

16
17
18
19
20

MR. KIMBERLY:

With all due respect, I think

you'd probably be in a better position to answer that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

I'm just

talking statistically.
MR. KIMBERLY:

I mean, certainly the Court

21

has been taking a large number of these cases recently.

22

It's been two or three each term.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I ­­
When you say

24

"taking" them, I mean, they're being presented to us.

25

We have no choice, but taking ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. KIMBERLY:

Right.

And I'm sorry.

What

3

I mean is noting probable jurisdiction and taking full

4

briefing and arguments in two or three such cases each

5

term.

6

But that, at least as I understand how the

7

Court operates, is ­­ is a question of ­­ of discretion,

8

whether it notes probable jurisdiction and takes that

9

additional step.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

On the issue of political

11

sensitivity, if it goes to a single judge, you will have

12

a decision by a judge who has presumably been selected

13

by the spin of the wheel, or by ­­ at random, and then

14

you'll have an appeal to a court of appeals panel that

15

is presumably chosen at random.

16

three­judge court, there will be a decision, and it may

17

involve some very sensitive findings of fact by a panel

18

that is hand­picked by the chief judge, who is in a

19

position to appoint himself or herself to the

20

three­judge court and select a third district judge who

21

the chief judge believes is likely to agree with or

22

defer to the chief judge.

23

Whereas if it goes to a

So I don't see how that ­­ how that creates

24

an insulation against the appearance of political

25

favoritism.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I ­­ it may be so that

2

in those cases, if ­­ if a litigant or a member of the

3

public dug down behind how the panel is appointed, that

4

there might be a basis for raising a concern.

5

certainly reflected in the congressional record that it

6

was Congress's judgment that the best protection against

7

that concern ­­ and ­­ and indeed, this goes back to the

8

original version of the Act back in 1910, that

9

Congress's concern was that the public could rest more

But it's

10

easy when decisions of such political importance and

11

sensitivity are decided by three judges rather than one.

12

If there are no further questions.
