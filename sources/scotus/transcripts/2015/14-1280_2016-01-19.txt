ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FROST:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

2

to engage in political association.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's just a

4

restatement of ­­ of Elrod.

5

would it be fair to the proposition that you are putting

6

before the Court to say that you're asserting the right

7

to be free from government inquiry into an oversight of

8

your views?

9

I ­­ I ­­ would ­­ would ­­

Would that be a fair statement?
MR. FROST:

That would be a fair statement,

Justice Kennedy.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because ­­ look, do we ­­

12

it sounds to me from the way you began your argument

13

that we take this case on the assumption that, if he had

14

picked up the sign, that if he had been supporting the

15

candidate for chief of police who was challenging the

16

incumbent, if he had been engaged in the activity, that

17

would be protected.

18

If ­­ you want us to take the case on that ­­ do we have

19

to accept that proposition for you to prevail in this

20

case?

21

He could not have been demoted.

MR. FROST:

No, you do not have to accept

22

that proposition.

23

a public employee, he has a right to either associate or

24

nonassociate, and he doesn't have to commit an

25

affirmative act in support, in this case, of the mayor's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but the ­­ the

3

First Amendment talks about abridging freedom of speech,

4

and I thought the case came to us on the proposition

5

that he wasn't engaging in speech at all.

6

not engaging in association, he was not engaging in

7

trying to convey a message, he was just picking up a

8

sign for his mother.

the case comes to us, I'm not sure how he can say his

And if that's the basis on which

freedom of speech has been abridged.

difference is, is that the employer perceived

4

nonassociation.

5

clearly, that has a chilling effect on other employees.

They

Their motive was to suppress that.

And

I mean, it's just very clear from the

7

testimony in this case.

8

page 50, what is very telling about this case is the

9

fact that when he went to pick up the sign, there was a

10

councilman there who was a chairperson of the election.

11

And he says to Heffernan, says, boy, you better be

12

careful.

13

we're ­­ because we're hanging up these signs.

15

only in this police department or in the City of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would you ­­ would you

say that he was demoted because he gave the appearance

6

of exercising his First Amendment rights?

7

MR. FROST:

Yes.

Because they perceived it

8

that he was exercising his rights, and the fact that he

actually was not engaged in any political activity

10

should make no difference with respect to the motivation

I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's
question about how we define the right here.

law I think that support that, and then I'd like to get

13

back to your concern about probing of beliefs.

14

think that the way that the Court defined the right at

15

issue in Branti and Rutan, and again in O'Hare,

16

demonstrates that an employee doesn't have to

17

affirmatively exercise his First Amendment rights first.

18

But we

So in those courts ­­ in ­­ in those cases

19

the court said that the plaintiff can show a

Well, I think actually in the

12

in any affirmative exercise of their First Amendment ­­

There are any number of reasons they could

All you have to assert is that the

25

was directly injured by the unconstitutional condition.

Alderson Reporting Company

But to respond directly to your point, I think ­­ I

2

don't think there's a serious concern here that there

will be a meritless ­­ a flood of meritless lawsuits or

4

anything like that, and that's primarily for two

5

reasons.

6

I take your point that ­­ that, you know,

7

this will expand the universe of ­­ of litigation

8

somewhat, but we already know in the statutory context,

9

the courts have recognized suits based on a mistaken

10

perception, and ­­ and in that context we haven't seen

11

any flood of meritless lawsuits.

reported decisions, what you see is that courts are able

8

to use Twombly and Iqbal and summary judgment in order

9

to get rid of claims where the allegations aren't

10

plausible or there's no evidence.

11

But I also think if the plaintiffs are going

12

to have to allege that ­­ that they actually held the

13

concern that Justice Kennedy mentioned earlier about

What is his

That's still a little unclear to me.

17

MS. ANDERS:

We think the defendant has

18

been hurt in the constitutional sense because the way

that the court has defined the right in question is the

20

right not to be subject to a test of political

21

affiliation when it's not a reasonable job requirement.

What the Court said in O'Hare,

respect to some job actions, there ­­ there would be

such a right under New Jersey law, and that's ­­ I'm not

sure whether it would apply here, but I think the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it based on the facts

MS. ANDERS:

Well, so there ­­ there is, I

think, a factual dispute about this.

12

the ­­ the summary judgment filings, this is document

13

No. 189 on Pacer, there ­­ there are, in ­­ in the

Respondents' statement of undisputed facts, some

assertions that this was in fact a neutrality policy.

So if you look at

coming back from the other side.

18

nobody knew about that policy.

resolve the dispute in that sense.

Petitioner says that

But I do want to get back to another concern

23

that I think Respondents' position raises.

24

do think that ­­ that Petitioner has his own First

25

Amendment right here.

That was violated.

Alderson Reporting Company

You know, we

Official

28
1

We do think that when an employer acts

2

against an employee based on a mistaken perception of

3

his beliefs, that creates exactly the same chilling

4

effect with which the Elrod cases are concerned.

5

So the other employees will know that the

6

employer expects political orthodoxy and will be chilled

7

in their ­­ in their own association as a result.

8
9

And I think there's another concern here
that deepens the chilling effect, and that is that the

10

logic of Respondents' position applies not only in cases

11

of honest mistake, it also applies in cases in which the

employer acts to exploit a loophole, essentially.

You can imagine a situation in which the

employer knows that some people have engaged in

message, and it does that by acting against the employee

17

it thinks didn't actually engage in that association.

18

And so I think that is one of the dangers of

19

Respondents' rule here, that it will create a loophole.

The employer wants to send a

that it's just a narrow corollary to the Elrod right

neutral ­­ that is, I see this candidate, I see that

that if you have a general rule, and the general rule

not have engaged in any association, then the

for the individual rights.

Now, if we didn't have other protections

the case being even stronger.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So in Waters it was the idea that the

In Garcetti it was the question of whether

It seems to me quite rare.

And it may be that this case comes to us the

way it does because the plaintiff was dealing with two

things, one was the First Amendment, and the other ­­ I

Now, I will say that it does nonetheless

matter because there are going to be other kinds of

that.
