ORAL ARGUMENT OF TYLER R. GREEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. GREEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Courts typically apply the exclusionary rule

11

to suppress unlawfully­seized evidence.

12

here is whether to suppress evidence lawfully seized in

13

a search incident to a warrant arrest because the

14

arresting officer found the warrant in a stop later

15

judged to be unlawful.

16

The question

Under this Court's attenuation analysis,

17

such evidence is admissible when, as here, the predicate

18

stop was not flagrant but resulted from an objectively

19

reasonable miscalculation.

20

Extending the exclusionary rule ­­

Justice Sotomayor, we've

If the officer here had stopped the first

we've admitted, I think if he had seen it and it were

6

suspicion, and I think that's why the prosecutor here

7

conceded that it wasn't.

But it was a close call based on everything
that he had seen to that point.

circumstances, we think that's why ­­ where the

incentive for just standing on the street corner in

me see your name.

MR. GREEN:

I understand, Your Honor.

that's the second part of my answer, is that officers

12

can't count ­­ under our rule, a warrant by itself is

not sufficient.

officer can't count in any particular stop on a judge

There still must be a separate inquiry

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I assume, Mr. Green,

18

that there are a variety of circumstances in which

19

police officers would really like to talk to somebody

20

and really like to search them but don't have reasonable

21

suspicion.

22

Justice Sotomayor is asking is if you're policing a

23

community where there is some significant percentage of

24

people who have arrest warrants out on them, it really

does increase your incentive to ­­ to make that stop on

MR. GREEN:

What ­­ Justice Kagan, I don't

think so.

6

turns, as it does, on not only on finding a warrant, but

7

then a determination of whether the stop was flagrant,

8

the officer has no guarantee before he makes the stop

that a judge will later conclude the stop was not.

10

I think, again, if the ­­ if the inquiry

17

something like that.

18

does change your incentives quite dramatically, it seems

19

to me, if you're policing a community where there is

21

warrants.

So it's, you know, a significant possibility that you're

13

going to find an arrest warrant and be able to admit

14

whatever drugs or guns or whatever it is you find.

15

MR. GREEN:

Well, I think, Your Honor, in

16

those circumstances, that's where the flagrancy inquiry

17

actually does the work of deterrence.

18

Court has explained, to be appropriate, suppression must

19

yield appreciable deterrence.

20

additional marginal deterrence that suppressing

21

everything following an event like this would yield, but

22

that's never been enough under this Court's precedence.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because as this

There may be some

police could stop anyone and say, whether I have

reasonable suspicion or not, I want to know your name ­­

This is a case where

you're telling us reasonable suspicion or not, the name,

a person's name, is not suppressible.

MR. GREEN:

That's right, Your Honor.

But

6

it is admittedly the but­for link between the initial

predicate unlawful stop, and the later discovery of the

warrant, and the arrest on the warrant, which is the

warrants outstanding, and particularly in the kind of

argument for why this will increase deterrence.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, Mr. Green ­­

Do you think that

7

something else includes a subjective component, whether

8

there was a purpose to see if there was a warrant?

9

MR. GREEN:

We don't, Your Honor.

We think

10

that that inquiry is inconsistent with the way this

11

Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has evolved.

12

It's ­­

that that would be a step maybe beyond our ­­ our ­­ our

cases.

17

On the ­­ on the other hand, if the inquiry

18

is one of flagrancy, then maybe that's necessary.

19

it may be particularly necessary here because under the

20

line of questioning that Justice Kagan just concluded

21

with you, it would seem odd for this Court to say the

higher crime ­­ the more it's a high­crime area, the

less basis you have to stop.

6

MR. GREEN:

That seems

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think

7

the answer to that question is ­­ is that in the cases

8

upon which Respondent relies, citing the ­­ the ­­ the

9

subjective­purpose requirement, those have all been

10

cases involving arrests without probable cause.

11

those circumstances, the ­­ the factors and the facts

that we think this Court discussed in those cases go to

13

show the objective unreasonableness of those particular

14

actions.

And in

can make the stop in order to investigate, in order to

MR. BASH:

12

the assumption that every warrant is for a different

person, which is probably not true.

14

that the population reflects the total number of people

15

who could be subject to warrants, but of course, people

extremely low.

And it would assume

MR. BASH:

What ­­ what would

Well, it's ­­ it's important to

know that Respondent's rule does nothing to solve the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

problem that the ­­ the Department of Justice in its

2

March report ­­ March 2015 report on Ferguson

3

identified.

4

What was going on in Ferguson is that the

5

municipal court, in conjunction with the police, were

6

using arrest warrants as a revenue­raising measure.

7

They were issuing warrants for very minor offenses and

8

failure to appear, and then police officers on the scene

9

had the incentive to arrest people to bring them in to

10

pay the fine.

11

that because everybody agrees the arrest is lawful.

12

Respondent's rule does nothing to solve

The Department of Justice did not find, even

13

in a community with as significant number of arrest

14

warrants as Ferguson, that officers had an incentive to

15

search, and that they were acting on an

16

incentive­to­search­people incident.

to arrest and pay the fine.

2

specific Ferguson case, but I still have my question,

3

which is why doesn't that dramatically change the

4

incentives for police officers in deciding whether to

5

search somebody?

6

significant possibility that somebody you stop is going

7

to have an arrest warrant, that's another reason to stop

8

them.

9

If you know that there is a

MR. BASH:

Justice Kagan, I don't think the

10

empirics show that the numbers are so great that even in

11

high­crime neighborhoods, at least outside of the

12

Ferguson circumstance where you have this odd

13

revenue­raising scheme, that the ­­ the chance of both

14

finding a warrant and then finding contraband in the

15

search ensuing to arrest is so high that it's

16

incentivizing officers to conduct illegal stops solely

17

for the purpose of finding a warrant.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that was my point about

19

the importance or the likely importance of purpose in

20

this analysis.

21
22
23

MR. BASH:

And ­­ and I was actually just

going to turn to that, Justice Kennedy.
I think when this Court has mentioned

24

flagrancy in cases, not only those cases listing the

25

Brown factors, but also cases like Leon and Herring,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

what it has been concerned about in part is the notion

2

that once you establish an attenuation principle, what I

3

would say is a common­sense principle here that

4

generally an arrest warrant should be a superseding

5

cause of the discovery of the evidence, you might have

6

an officer exploiting that rule precisely in order to

7

get evidence in searches incident to arrests.

8
9

So I think the way you could think about
flagrancy is:

Did this officer have the purpose ­­ and

10

it could either be a purpose objectively understood from

11

all of the facts or it could be a subjective purpose ­­

12

to exploit this attenuation exception precisely in order

13

to search incident to arrest.

14

I don't think the facts here remotely get

15

there.

16

argued that.

17

officer may have made a mistake about the quantum of

18

suspicion necessary, but if you had a case where an

19

officer truly, either objectively or subjectively, is

20

going out, just pulling random people over because he

21

now knows about this attenuation rule established in

22

this case, I think that's the sort of flagrancy

23

consideration in cases like Leon and Herring this Court

24

has left as a safety valve.

3

sounds like the kind of inquiry that we've tried to stay

4

away from in the past.

Because that

5

MR. BASH:

6

suggested subjective motivations.

Brown and Dunaway and Taylor, where it really did seem

9

to be that the Court was inquiring about purpose.

Justice Kagan, Justice Kennedy
And I think that has

And

10

it also has some support in doctrines like inevitable

11

discovery, which does ask, you know, what were you going

12

to do, in effect?

13

In more recent cases, the Court has moved

14

towards an objective test.

15

could formulate the flagrancy safety valve in this case

16

is to say does this stop appear objectively designed to

17

exploit the ability to search, incident to arrest on a

18

warrant.

19

So I think the way the Court

And it could look at all the circumstances.

20

It could look at the fact that this wasn't incident to

any legitimate investigation.

22

that the officer pulled over several people and searched

something that the State's conceded, right?

2

MS. WATT:

Well, I think it's important

because the State has taken the position that ­­ that

And being a fact or two shy of Terry leaves us
Terry is already a fairly­low standard,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you still have to say

that it's flagrant.
MS. WATT:

Well, my position is ­­ is

11

twofold; one, that ­­ that flagrancy has two aspects.

12

One aspect is just the deliberate aspect.

13

in ­­ in this type of a stop where ­­ where it's made

14

for the purpose of ­­ of running a warrants check, if

15

the ­­ the warrants check is inherent in the stop, that

16

that's enough; but secondly, if we were going to ­­

17

going to include a different definition, it would be

18

that it was blatantly unconstitutional.

And that

19

And so that's why I'm moving into the stop,

20

to talk about what was the problem with this stop, what

21

do we expect of our police officers, what do we need

22

from our police officers?

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You ­­ you said that

24

the ­­ that the stop was made for the purpose of running

25

for the arrest warrants.

I just don't know the basis

for that, other than your statistics that in certain

2

areas there are a high number of arrest warrants.

many areas there aren't.

In

we have to accept and generalize from your empirical

evidence which ­­ that the purpose must be to execute or

to check for arrest warrants?

MS. WATT:

In this case, we ­­

How does ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

runs the arrest ­­ warrants check when he makes the stop

because he wants to know who he's dealing with.

16

would be ­­ it would be, I think, bad police work to not

17

run the warrant check until after you've had an

18

interaction with the person when the danger that you

19

could have found out about might have been when it's too

20

late to ­­ to act on it.

21

MS. WATT:

It

The way he finds out who he's

dealing with is if there's a warrant.

didn't have a reasonable suspicion to stop my client.

24

And so ­­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The point is, he

that.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In order to run the

purpose was.

7

the purpose is to ­­ to run the warrants check.

8

just want to know why that's ­­ why that's the case.

9

In your brief you say several times, oh,

MS. WATT:

And I

Because it was immediate; it was

10

inherent in what he did; because he stated that his

11

purpose in ­­ in stopping my client was to find out

12

about my ­­ find out about the house; and that it was

13

normal for him to run a warrants check and normal for

him to know ­­ want to know who he's dealing with so.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're ­­
Let's say that the

people.

19

that was his purpose in ­­ in the stop.

20

I don't doubt that, but it doesn't prove that

MS. WATT:

So the intended consequence of

running a warrants check is to find a warrant, No. 1.

routinely checking every single person that he stops,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So part of the stop may

be to investigate, but the other part of the stop is

9

he's doing this routinely, with no reasonable suspicion,

10

11

He's demanding peoples' names, and he's running a

MS. WATT:

But this presents a completely

4

different scenario.

5

Mr. Strieff.

6

as a matter of deterrence, a reasonably well­trained

7

officer would have known, should have known that there

8

wasn't enough there.

9

about my client, there was no individualized suspicion.

10

This officer approached

He knew very little about him.

You know,

Because he didn't know anything

And ­­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, we really don't know

12

very much about exactly what happened here, which is

13

unfortunate.

he ­­ he approached him and he said ­­ identified

18

activity going on in the house, and he asked him to

19

tell ­­ he said, "I asked him to tell me what he was

20

doing there."

21

But what the officer testified was that he

He did say that

He said he thought there might be drug

Now, we don't even know what he ­­ unless

22

I'm ­­ it's someplace else in this record, we don't even

23

know what your client said.

24

what am I doing there, yeah, I live there, or, my mother

But he could have said,

Alderson Reporting Company

But whatever ­­ we don't know what he said.

But then at some later point he ran a warrants check.

3

So how can we infer from that, that the whole point of

4

the stop was to run the warrants check?

5

MS. WATT:

So ­­ so a really important part

6

of the officer's testimony was that he didn't remember

7

what that answer was.

8

in there because there's someone who's ill and I've been

visiting for, you know, 20 minutes, or ­­ or, this is

The ­­ the important part of this case is

that if we're only looking at ­­ we're not just looking

straightforward case that is going on every day in this

21

country where officers are looking at houses, watching

23

They're trying to establish probable cause.

21

in ­­ in a catch­and­release type of approach with our

citizenry.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In ­­ in your brief you

took the position that ­­ that an event is intervening

Alderson Reporting Company

only if it is unforeseeable.

2

MS. WATT:

Well, our position is that an

3

intervening circumstance needs to be independent, and

4

it ­­ it needs to be a break in the ­­ the causal chain.

5

And that when ­­ when a warrant is run ­­ and it needs

6

to be something that is not directly related to the

7

officer's conduct.

8
9

And so because the warrants check is an
inherent part of ­­ of the detention, it's not an

10

intervening circumstance.

11

that the Utah Supreme Court unanimously agreed with in

12

the dissent in the Utah court of appeals as well, agreed

13

that this is ­­ it's a natural and foreseeable

consequence.

circumstances.

look at free will, and that's independent and breaks the

22

chain.

23

It was a direct result of the officer's conduct.

Spontaneous confessions are something

We

But here there was no break.

24

The ­­ the rule that we are really asking

the Court to ­­ to adopt follows settled exclusionary

2

bad stop, it's suppressed unless there is attenuation.

3

And of course, if there hadn't been a

4

warrant, if ­­ if the officer had just stopped my client

5

and searched him, I don't think anyone's contesting that

6

that would just simply be suppressed without
