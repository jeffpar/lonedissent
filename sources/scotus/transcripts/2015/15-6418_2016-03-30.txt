Mr. Ali.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMIR H. ALI

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ALI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Johnson is retroactive because it is a rule

12

of substantive criminal law, not a procedural rule that

13

regulates only the manner of determining a defendant's

14

culpability or sentence.

15

straightforward test for distinguishing between those

16

rules that are procedural and those that are

17

substantive.

18

This Court applies a

Assuming perfect trial or sentencing

19

procedures, does the new rule change the authorized

20

outcomes of the criminal process?

21

court could have reached the same outcome had it applied

22

perfect procedures, then we're dealing with a procedural

23

rule.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. ALI:

If no, meaning that a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do with

2

the ­­ the argument that the ­­ the concern that

3

motivated Johnson is all procedural?

4

defendant that checks against arbitrary enforcement,

5

those are procedural concerns?

6

MR. ALI:

Fair notice to the

Your Honor, we think under this

7

Court's decision in Bousley, it's clear that you don't

8

look to the source of the rule and that that's not

9

governing.

And what's relevant here, as it was in

10

relevant ­­ in Bousley is that there was no valid active

11

Congress which authorized the punishment for a class of

12

persons.

13

14

crimes under ACCA.

15

Here the class of persons who, absent the

In Bousley, the class of persons

But to answer your question more directly,

17

Justice Ginsburg, as we explain on page 16, 17 of our

18

reply brief, we think it's far from clear, even if that

19

were the test, that vagueness sounds only in procedural

20

due process.

21

think, from procedural due process in the sense that it

22

does control or regulate which criminal prescriptions

23

Congress can or cannot pass in a way that we don't think

24

of when it comes to procedural due process.

25

In fact, it's qualitatively different, we

So Johnson didn't say, Government, if you

provide notice to people or greater notice, you can

life under the residual clause.

6

What

No person may be sentenced to 15 to

So what we know now is that people, like

7

Petitioner, are spending somewhere between an additional

8

five years to the rest of their life in prison based on

9

where there was no valid active Congress which

10

authorized that punishment.

11

very clearly a substantive rule under Bousley.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that, we believe, is

Well, before you get ­­ you

13

continue too deeply into the substance of your argument,

14

could I just ask a possibly irritating question about

15

the facts of this particular case?

16

that you raise in the cert petition is whether the

17

district court was in error when it denied relief on

18

Petitioner's 2255 motion.

19

The first question

And, I mean, I want to ­­ if you look at

20

page 96A of the Joint Appendix, the first sentence of ­­

21

I'm sorry, the paragraph 8 on that page, can you tell me

22

if you were a district court judge, would you have seen

23

in that argument the argument that the residual clause

24

of the Armed Career Criminal Act is unconstitutionally

25

vague?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

6
1

MR. ALI:

Your Honor, we believe that with

2

liberal pro se pleading standards, that what's said on

3

96 and what's said on page 83 where Petitioner invokes

4

his Fifth Amendment right to due process, combining that

5

with the language here, that he does not mean ­­ meet

6

Armed Career Criminal requirements because it's, quote,

7

"ambiguous, vague, and without any violence," we think

8

that would satisfy it.

9

that that ­­

10

But more importantly, we think

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, just ­­ and, I mean,

11

this wasn't exactly the question I asked.

12

when I was on the court of appeals, and we reversed the

13

district court judge, they would always complain that,

14

you know, you're asking us to ­­ to ­­ you don't

15

understand our situation.

16

Particularly

My ­­ my question is, if you were a district

17

judge, would you have seen in this sentence,

18

"Petitioner's robbery under Florida State statute

19

Section 812, et cetera, is ambiguous, vague, and was

20

without any violence and/or physical force," if you read

21

that, as a district court judge, would you have seen in

22

that the argument that the Court adopted in Johnson?

23
24
25

MR. ALI:
yes.

Your Honor, I think the answer is

Again ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

You would have ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7
1

MR. ALI:

­­ when you read it with the

2

sentence before ­­ and ­­ and but more fundamentally, I

3

think the answer is that it doesn't matter because

4

there's no question that Petitioner is entitled to the

5

benefit of Johnson in this case.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

How can it not matter?

7

You're arguing that the district judge made a mistake.

8

So your answer is you would have seen it there, and you

9

would be a very prescient district judge.

10

That's the

answer.

11

MR. ALI:

Well, Your Honor, my more complete

12

answer is that the questions presented that were drafted

13

in this case and granted about the Court were drafted by

14

a pro se litigant.

15

And I think that taking the two questions

16

together, what those questions ask are:

17

of appeals err in reversing ­­ or in denying a

18

certificate of appealability?

19

referring to, did it err on the basis of the elements

20

clause question.

21

whether reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether

22

Petitioner's conviction qualified under the elements

23

clause.

24
25

Did the court

So the first question is

And that raises merely the question of

And the second prong goes to Johnson's
retroactivity, which, again, raises the question of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

8
1

whether reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether

2

Johnson is retroactive.

3

So it may be the case that the first

4

question presented as drafted by the pro se litigant

5

when it was ­­ and granted by this Court suggests to you

6

the question is that whether the district court erred.

7

But I think the better reading of the question is

8

whether the district ­­ sorry, whether the court of

9

appeals was erroneous in reversing ­­ or in denying this

10

certificate of appealability.

Your Honor, with respect to the

17

challenged whether he qualified under either of the two

clauses, the residual clause or the elements clause.

It's ­­ it was not ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They didn't make that a

holding.
MR. ALI:

It did not make that a holding.

That's correct, Your Honor.

What it did was fall back

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

9
1

on the residual clause, as many courts at this time did,

2

because the residual clause, as this Court acknowledged

3

in Johnson, provided a relatively easy standardless

4

analysis that would allow ­­ that ­­ that many people

5

could be subsumed with it, and that's really the problem

6

here, is we're dealing with an instance in which there

7

was no active Congress which authorized this under

8

Johnson.

9

deciding whether people did or did not fall under

And what we had was essentially courts

10

this ­­ this clause that this Court has described as

11

nearly impossible to apply as a judicial morass in a

12

black hole which frustrated any attempt to apply.

13

we think it follows from that, that this is clearly a

14

substantive rule getting back into the merits of ­­ of

15

retroactivity.

16

And

And if ­­ if you will, Your Honors, I'd like

17

to just talk briefly about how illogical it would be to

18

deny retroactivity in this case.

19

So consider a decision of this Court, like

20

Skilling, where the Court narrowly interpreted the

21

honest services fraud statute to its core conduct,

22

bribery and kickbacks.

23

Now, that case under under ­­ under Bousley

24

would be retroactive, because it is an interpretation

25

and ­­ and everybody who falls out of that core scope

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

10
1

would get the benefit of ­­ of Skilling retroactively,

2

and that's what the court of ­­ courts of appeals have

3

concluded.

4

Now if the Court denies retroactivity here,

5

what it would be saying was ­­ is if the three justices

6

in Skilling had their way and instead the Court had

7

concluded that there is no possible interpretation of

8

this statute, it's incapable of interpretation, all of

9

those same people ­­ if the Court went the further step,

10

all of those same people would be denied relief, and

11

that ­­ we think that's entirely arbitrary.

12

and it shows in the context of ACCA itself.

13

And it ­­

So this Court in Begay said that DUI does

14

not clearly fall within ACCA's residual clause.

15

then in chambers the Court said that failure to report

16

to a penal institution does not clearly fall within

17

ACCA's residual clause.

18

decisions, those are retroactively applicable, and the

19

Court's amicus agrees with those ­­ should be

20

retroactively applicable.

21

And

And as the Court made those

And what the Court would be saying if it

22

denied retroactivity here is that if the Court goes the

23

further step and says, in fact, we have no idea what

24

Congress did or did not want to follow, so nothing

25

clearly follows or almost nothing clearly falls within

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

11
1

this clause, that retroactivity ­­ nobody would get the

2

benefit of retroactivity.

3

result.

4

We think that's an untenable

So Your Honor, if I ­­ if there are no

5

further questions, I think I'll reserve the remaining

6

time I have for rebuttal.

FOR THE RESPONDENT

IN SUPPORT OF VACATUR AND REMAND

12

MR. DREEBEN:

13
14

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The United States agrees that Johnson

15

constitutes a substantive decision that's retroactively

16

applicable on collateral review.

17

is the controlling inquiry here.

18

The effect of Johnson

What Johnson did was eliminate a substantive

19

basis for imposing an enhanced sentence under the ACCA.

20

And the effect of that is to create a class of people

21

that the law cannot punish under ACCA.

22

Court's language in Schriro v. Summerlin on the

23

definition of a substantive rule.

24

The reason ­­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This is the

I'm a little troubled by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

12
1

the use of the word "class of people."

Amicae is right

2

that that's almost a circular argument.

You're a class

3

of people because I say you can't be covered by this.

4

It doesn't make much sense in terms ­­ can't be covered

5

by this law.

6

What's ­­ isn't there a simpler way of

7

arguing this, which is that if ­­ and your co­counsel is

8

­­ Petitioner's counsel is suggesting it.

9

If you can be retried under the existing law

10

with a corrective process, that's procedural.

11

can't be retried and sentenced that way, that's

12

substance ­­ substantive.

13
14

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I ­­ I think that's a

fine way, Justice Sotomayor, of ­­

15
16

If you

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Pretty simple rule.

What's wrong with it?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

The only caveat that I have

18

about it at all is, as this Court knows from Montgomery

19

v.

20

invalidates a mandatory minimum punishment within an

21

existing range is a substantive rule because it expands

22

the range of outcomes.

23

that the defendant actually received, but it does

24

require an expanded range of outcomes, and we regard

25

that as a substantive holding.

Louisiana, the government's view is that a law that

May not eliminate the outcome

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

13
1

But with that caveat, I entirely agree that

2

the basic distinction between substance and procedure is

3

the substantive holding changes the question that the

4

court or the sentencer is answering.

5

from, in this case, did the defendant have a conviction

6

that qualified under the residual clause, to does he

7

have a conviction that qualifies under the elements

8

clause or the enumerated offense clause only.

9

strikes from the statute a basis ­­ a discrete basis for

10

It changes it

It ­­ it

finding ACCA applicable.

11

And that is, I think, as you correctly point

12

out, Justice Sotomayor, very different from a procedural

13

rule that would say you have to give the defendant 20

14

days' notice before the defendant litigates this, or the

15

defendant has to be able to introduce certain kinds of

16

evidence in support of the defendant's claim.

17

Court is still answering the very same question:

18

there a violent felony under a preexisting definition

19

unaltered by the Court's new ruling.

20

But the
Was

And once the Court divides the world between

21

procedural consequences and substantive changes in the

22

law that alter the question, the very question that the

23

Court is answering, I think that resolves the

24

substance­versus­procedure inquiry.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If ­­
­­ in a State court ­­ a

3

State criminal system if the statute says that the judge

4

may take into account whether or not past acts and past

5

crimes were crimes of violence, and a judge makes that

finding?

statute that was struck down in Johnson.

8

results there?

9

It's almost in ­­ in the same terms as the

MR. DREEBEN:

What ­­ what

Justice Kennedy, I think the

10

result would be the same if it were actually an ­­ an

11

analogous State law provision that was worded the same

12

and that was invalidated on vagueness grounds in other

13

words.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's ­­ that's even

15

assuming that the sentence the judge gave after making

16

that finding was within the maximum permitted by the

17

statute?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

If the substantive basis

19

for imposing that sentence is altered so that the judge

20

could no longer rely on the fact that he did rely on to

21

impose that sentence, then it ­­ it alters substantive

22

law.

23

And there may be defendants, and in fact

24

Petitioner may be one for whom ACCA is still applicable,

25

because there is an alternative way of imposing the same

sentence.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you explain it, how

But you say these

Can you spell that out?

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

8

time of the conviction, he was convicted of strong­arm

9

robbery.

And there was an argument that he raises, and

10

continues to raise, that strong­arm robbery doesn't

11

require, as interpreted by Florida law at the time of

12

his conviction, violent force.

13

held is required to satisfy the elements clause in ACCA

14

in the other Johnson case, the Curtis Johnson case.

15

This is what the court

So he argues that violent force wasn't

16

required; that the Eleventh Circuit looked at some State

17

law precedents and said we're just not going to decide

18

this issue; it's easier to resolve under the residual

19

clause.

20

Circuit law.

21

it.

So it remained an open issue under Eleventh
And the courts below just haven't decided

22

I think there is a very substantial argument

23

that a proper reading of Florida State law would lead to

24

the conclusion that you do need to use enough force to

25

take property from another person to be convicted of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

16
1

Florida strong­arm robbery, and that would satisfy the

2

Curtis Johnson standard, in which case his conviction

3

would count, but on an alternative basis.

4

But he has arguments to the contrary.

They

5

have never been reviewed by the courts below.

6

is why the government's view is that this Court should

7

resolve the retroactivity of Johnson in this case if it

8

concludes that Johnson is retroactive.

9

being a court of first view on the elements clause, the

10
11

And that

Rather than

Court should let the Eleventh Circuit sort that out.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Eleventh Circuit, as

12

counsel said, decided the case on the basis of the

13

residual clause.

14

that's a little foggy to me, and it doesn't arise in

15

Welch's case because this is ­­ his is a first 2255

16

motion; is that ­­

But there's one other part of this

17

MR. DREEBEN:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is correct.
And there's something

19

about successive ­­ second or successive motions.

20

that work a little differently, or is this ­­

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Does

It works very differently,

22

Justice Ginsburg.

23

24

to the court of appeals and request authorization and

25

receive it under 2255(h).

To get certified for filing of a

And 2255(h)(2) permits

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

17
1

certification when a new rule of constitutional law has

2

been made retroactive to cases on collateral review by

3

this Court.

4

that the ruling that's relied upon is retroactive.

5

So it requires a ruling from this Court

And the courts of appeals have split,

6

methodologically and substantively, on whether this

7

Court has made Johnson retroactive.

8
9

To be very brief about it, the government's
position is that this Court has done so through a

10

combination of holdings.

11

substantive rules are retroactive; Johnson is a

12

substantive rule; therefore, this Court's jurisprudence

13

makes Johnson retroactive.

14

It's a syllogism.

All

But that has occasioned substantial

15

disagreement in the courts of appeals.

16

Congress precluded certiorari review in the AEDPA, so

17

this Court cannot directly review that conflict.

18

Unfortunately,

If the Court in this case were to hold that

19

Johnson is retroactive, it would make Johnson

20

retroactive, and thereby entitle the second or

21

successive filers to come in.

22

believes that that would be appropriate because if, in

23

fact, they are serving an ACCA sentence based on a

24

residual clause conviction, they're in jail for a

25

minimum of five years longer than Congress ever validly

And the government

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

18
1

authorized.

2

And in the government's view, that's the

3

kind of substantive holding that Justice Harlan had in

4

mind in the Mackey case, which was the progenitor of the

5

Teague opinion.

6

has come to rest at a point where it never should have

7

come to rest.

8

It's ­­ means that the criminal process

The residual clause was not found to be

9

unconstitutional until Johnson, but once the Court has

10

concluded ­­ contrary to the government's argument, to

11

be sure ­­ but that it is facially void, it means that

12

Congress never supplied a valid basis for those

13

sentences.

14

doctrinal framework that the Court has announced for

15

habeas cases and for the substantive versus procedural

16

inquiry to hold it retroactive.

17

And we think that it is consistent with the

Now the amicus in support of the judgment

18

20

the source of the underlying right rather than the

21

effect that it has in the criminal proceeding.

22

Its method ­­ its approach is to look at

That approach is in some ways reminiscent of

23

the first step in retroactivity analysis under

24

Linkletter v. Walker, the very approach that the Court

25

overthrew in Teague.

That inquiry said, what was the

argument would send the courts back to look at that as

12

when it is the very basis for criminal liability, in

other words, punishing somebody for failing to

14

incriminate themselves, Justice Harlan said that's a

15

substantive effect, and it's entitled to retroactivity.

16

And that is a procedural rule, but

When, on the other hand, it simply gives

rise to evidence that should not have been admitted in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HELGI C. WALKER

23

Thank you, counsel.

FOR THE COURT­APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE

24

IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

25

MS. WALKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

24
1

please the Court:

2

In the 25 years since Teague was decided,

3

this Court has never held that a new rule based on the

4

central procedural guarantees of the due process clause,

5

in either the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth

6

Amendment, nonetheless constituted a substantive rule

7

that could apply to overturn final criminal judgments.

8
9
10

You should not do so for the first time
here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How can it not be

11

substantive when, under one rule, the sentence range

12

goes minimum of 15 years up to life, and the other

13

reading, it's zero to ten years?

14

anything more substantive than five extra ­­ a minimum

15

of five extra years in prison.

16

MS. WALKER:

I can't imagine

Because the government's

17

articulation of the test, which is an effects­based test

18

that they draw from a statutory construction case,

19

Bousley, is not the proper inquiry for asking whether a

20

new constitutional rule is substantive or procedural.

21

Since Penry, which, after all, was the case that first

22

extended Teague's first exception into the sentencing

23

context in the first place, there, the Court looked for

24

the existence of a, quote, "substantive categorical

25

constitutional guarantee."

And ever since, that's what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

25
1

this Court has looked for.

2

said, just two months in Montgomery, is the existence of

3

a, quote, "substantive constitutional guarantee."

4

must be the lodestar for whether a new constitutional

rule is procedural or substantive.

12

Scalia looked to the Sixth Amendment right to jury

14

the new rule announced in Ring.

15

can't be substantive because the Sixth Amendment jury

17

that Congress can either punish or prohibit.

And that actually proves my

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What ­­ what

13

there must be some procedures that would allow people to

14

be convicted.

15

If it's a procedural protection,

What are they?

MS. WALKER:

Absolutely.

What Johnson

16

required was the use of a framework that specified the

17

nature of the inquiry to be conducted and the kinds of

18

factors to be considered.

19

And the fact that Congress can go back and

20

fix the problem with residual clause, as members of this

21

Court have pointed out, and as my friends on the other

22

side concede, only shows that Johnson did not, quote,

23

deprive ­­ that's the language of Montgomery, that's the

24

language of Penry ­­ did not deprive Congress of any

25

substantive power, if you will, to impose 15­year

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

27

sentences.

2

The problem in Johnson was not that

3

something was wrong with 15­year mandatory minimums, per

4

se, but just that Congress hadn't articulated its ­­ its

5

statutory goal in sufficiently precise terms.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose you have a statute

8

which makes it a crime to engage in conduct annoying to

9

others?

10

MS. WALKER:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

13

MS. WALKER:

That was Coates.
And the Court said this is

That's procedural.
That's the Coates decision,

14

which said ­­ struck down a State law, I think it was ­­

15

that said that you can't stand on the street and annoy

16

other people, and you definitely can't annoy a police

17

officer.

18

The Court said that is void­for­vagueness,

19

because nobody can tell what the particular standard is.

20

What the Court actually went out of its way to say,

21

certainly States can regulate behavior on the street.

22

We're not saying that States lack the power to do this.

23

We're just saying you have to do this in a sufficiently

24

clear way.

25

So Coates fully supports our reading of the

void­for­vagueness doctrine.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the procedural

Justice Ginsburg.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

32
1

First, the case of Bousley is a statutory

2

construction case.

3

in Bousley.

4

said there, writing for the Court, is that when this

5

Court interprets a statute, we are outside the Teague

6

framework entirely.

7

8

So there wasn't even a new statutory issue there.

9

There was no new constitutional rule

So all the late Chief Justice Rehnquist

And there, of course, the Court

When the court says what a statute

10

definitively means, it is making a judicial

11

determination that the conduct at issue falls

12

definitively outside the scope of the relevant statute.

13

Here, precisely because Johnson said that the clause was

14

hopelessly indeterminant, we can't know with certainty

15

that everybody's conduct fell outside the clause.

16

the end of the day, it is a function of this Court's

17

approach to statutory construction decisions on the one

18

hand, which just aren't affected by Teague.

19

the problem that Teague set out to solve was

20

retroactivity in a world of changing constitutional

21

rules.

JUSTICE BREYER:

If we could go back to

18

MS. WALKER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that amazes me.

20

Because I thought the point of Teague was that if the

statute under which they are convicted doesn't exist

22

anymore because ­­ for whatever reason ­­ because, for

23

example ­­ and did not exist at the time, because it was

is a change having to do with the accuracy of the

that statute still exists.

We only apply

And the notion that when this Court declares

10

a statute unconstitutional, for any reason, that makes

11

the underlying judgment or conviction or sentence

12

unlawful and as if it never were, the void ab initio

13

concept, going all the way back to the 19th century, has

14

been rejected by this Court in its retroactivity cases.

15

Linkletter explained that even when this Court

16

invalidates a statute, the prior existence of that

17

statute is an operative fact that cannot justly be

18

ignored.

19

So we've moved past, well past any notion

20

where a law that has been declared subsequently

21

unconstitutional simply disappears, and we must all

22

pretend it never existed.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, but that's still ­­

24

you have a point that, because it's not quite like the

25

pest statute.

The pest statute, when we say there is no

2

3

that statute, there was no such statute, or it isn't in

4

the future, you see?

And there they are, 22

And so we say, you get out.

5

On the other hand, if the only reason that

6

they ­­ anybody got out is because they were convicted

7

under a procedure, you see, that was unconstitutional,

8

they are within the class of a valid statute putting in

9

jail.

10

The valid statute puts them in jail.

11

we're not certain he's the right one because the

12

procedure was unfair.

13

And that's the procedural thing.

14

backwards.

15

But

Is he really that kind of person?

On the other hand, after time has passed, a

21

and there is no statute of the Federal government that

25

That seems to be the problem in this case.

if it's going to apply on collateral review.

9

you're not quite sure whether it's procedural or

So if

substantive, then the default has to go to

nonretroactivity, because whether we want to call

whether we simply want to say they're not subject to

Teague at all, the point is there's a particular type of

rule that qualifies as substantive.

squarely qualify as substantive, and I think the fact

17

that my friends have had to resort to an effects­based

18

test that draws from a statutory construction case that

19

analogizes to the actual first Teague exception, shows

20

that Johnson doesn't squarely fall into the bucket of a

21

substantive rule.

22

And if it doesn't

And my second response, Justice Breyer,

23

would be that Teague assumes, it's inherent in Teague,

24

that there will be constitutional violations that go

25

unremedied.

Otherwise, all new constitutional rules as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

40

announced by this Court would apply retroactively.

2

that is certainly not what Justice Harlan ever intended.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

How ­­ my

4

understanding is that it's properly categorized as

5

procedural if there's some people who could be convicted

6

under it legitimately; in other words, Miranda ­­ you

7

didn't get Miranda warnings, but you know, you were a

8

criminal law professor, you knew what your rights were.

9

But who is it who could be convicted

10

legitimately under the residual clause?

11

yes, okay, it's ­­ it's vague, whatever, but you are

12

definitely covered, so you shouldn't get the protection

13

of what you would regard as a procedural flaw.

14

MS. WALKER:

We're sure,

We certainly agree that Johnson

15

invalidated the residual clause, and therefore, to

16

answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice, nobody can be

17

sentenced under the residual clause going forward, and

18

the residual ­­ anybody that was sentenced under the

19

residual clause would get the benefit of that new rule

20

on direct appeal.

21

But the question that Teague asks is whether

22

that remedy should be available on collateral review.

23

And the answer to that depends upon ­­ and this was

24

reaffirmed just two months ago in Montgomery ­­ the

25

existence of a substantive procedural guarantee.

Alderson Reporting Company

Once

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

41

we cut the analysis loose, subs procedure under Teague's

2

first exception, cut it loose from the underlying

3

constitutional basis for the rule, we're going to be

4

entirely at sea.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I ­­ but my

6

understanding is that the characterization of that as

7

procedural, it turns on whether or not there is a

8

significant group of people who could be convicted under

9

that provision where vagueness would be off the table.

10

Now, however, it may appear to other people

11

engaging in this type of conduct.

12

them, but for this group of people, that's not vague.

13

So we're not worried about not applying it

14

retroactively.

15

MS. WALKER:

Maybe it's vague for

Yes.
I guess what I'm

12

trying to ask you is who are the people who you can say,

13

without a doubt, their conduct otherwise involves

14

conduct that presents a serious potential risk of

15

physical injury?

16

MS. WALKER:

The people who committed the

17

crimes that were at issue in this Court's decisions in

18

James and Sykes, the people who had engaged in vehicular

19

flight, and the second crime is now escaping.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The problem in

21

Johnson, I think we took a look back and said, yeah,

22

well, we did say that, but I have to think Johnson

23

suggests that those decisions were not clear.

24
25

MS. WALKER:

Certainly Johnson overruled

those decisions with respect to the vagueness holding,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

43
1

but this Court itself said that people who engaged in

2

those two particular crimes were entirely correctly

3

sentenced under the residual clause.

4

didn't say that that itself was wrong.

5

The Court actually

And what's interesting about

6

void­for­vagueness doctrine, and Johnson in particular,

7

is that it took 30 years for the vagueness of the

8

residual clause, the hopeless indeterminacy of it, to

9

materialize.

That's all the more reason not to pretend

10

as if the residual clause never existed at all, as my

11

friends would have us do under the nineteenth century

12

Blackstonian.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you would go back

14

and say that we think that vehicular homicide is conduct

15

that ­­ today, with the benefit of the analysis in

16

Johnson ­­ I mean, assuming we were wrong in those

17

cases, which I think Johnson suggests or said, that

18

nonetheless it's clear that those people, the vehicular

19

homicide people, we shouldn't be concerned about

20

applying this ­­ not applying this retroactively because

21

they, and other ­­ and other category clearly are

22

covered by it.

23

In other words, put aside our cases where I

24

think ­­ I understand your argument, well, we decided

25

that, but I ­­ I think Johnson suggests we decided it

wrongly.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

example?

9

MS. WALKER:

Other kinds of crimes that have

10

been found by the lower courts to count are attempted

11

rape, child molestation, assault with intent to kill.

12

think all of those crimes would fall within the

13

heartland of the residual clause without a whole lot of

14

debate.

15

I

But the point, again, is that we need to go

16

back to the existence of a substantive constitutional

guarantee.

18

case is because Penry extended Teague into the

19

sentencing context by reasoning that Justice Harlan had

20

spoken of, quote, substantive categorical guarantees

21

accorded by the Constitution.

22

even attempted to fit Johnson within that core of

23

Justice Harlan's theory.

24
25

The reason why we are here in a sentencing

Nobody in this case has

This Court said that James ­­ the case of

said was that it was skeptical that those clear examples

What we're saying is this court,

to be clear, has not distinguished in the context of

10

talking about whether someone's confinement is unlawful.

11

Now, what we're saying and what the ­­ I think the

governing how you reach that sentence.

19

which qualifies someone or makes someone eligible for

20

the punishment authorized, which leads to the

21

circumstance which Your Honor described, which is that

22

this person, the Petitioner, is now spending time in

23

prison that was not authorized by any valid act of

24

Congress.

25

It's not simply a procedure or some sort of rule
It's that rare

And that's what makes this case much more

Alderson Reporting Company

clear than the guidelines, because someone in the

2

guideline's circumstance cannot assert that aspect of

3

it, that my sentence was not authorized by any valid act

4

of Congess.

5

Now, again, there may be arguments that

6

could be made to suggest that that's valid, that it's

7

relevantly similar, but it's certainly not something

8

that's necessarily entailed.

I'd just like to comment briefly on the idea
