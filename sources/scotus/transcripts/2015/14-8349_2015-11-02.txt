Mr. Bright.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. STEPHEN B. BRIGHT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

We'll hear argument

MR. BRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The prosecutors in this case came to court

11

on the morning of jury selection determined to strike

12

all the black prospective jurors.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Bright, maybe

14

you could address first the ­­ the question we raised on

15

Friday with respect to which court certiorari should be

16

directed to.

17

MR. BRIGHT:

18

We filed this petition originally certiorari

Yes, Your Honor.

19

to the Supreme Court of Georgia.

20

Court in Sears v. Upton had issued certiorari ­­ this is

21

in 2010 ­­ to the Supreme Court of Georgia in a similar

22

situation.

23

And of course this

It appears to us, from looking at this over

24

the weekend, that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company v.

25

Durham County, which the Court has decided in eight ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

in 1986, the Court said that, unless there was positive

2

assurance that the decision was not a ruling on the

3

merits, then the writ went to the State supreme court.

4

And the Georgia court, while it has rules

5

and statutes and its own opinions that are not totally

6

in harmony with one another, the rule, nonetheless, is

7

that a certificate of probable cause, which is what was

8

denied in this case, is to be granted if there is

9

arguable merit to the case.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you think that

11

affects the scope of our review?

12

addressing just whether there's arguable merit to the

13

claim or are we addressing the claim on its own merits?

14

MR. BRIGHT:

In other words, are we

Well, I ­­ I think what this

15

Court has done in ­­ in all these cases is apply Yist v.

16

Nunnemaker to look through to the last reasoned

17

decision, and that would be the decision of the habeas

18

corpus court.

19

rules, an application is made for certificate of

20

probable cause to the Georgia Supreme Court, and that is

21

often denied summarily.

22

was in this case.

23

In Georgia, typically the habeas court

It is denied summarily as it

It was denied.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I really don't understand

24

that.

25

Supreme Court, not the ­­ not the habeas court, right?

You ­­ you say we would be reversing the Georgia

Alderson Reporting Company

5
1

And ­­ and all that the Georgia Supreme Court held is

2

that there ­­ there ­­ is that there was no arguable

3

basis for ­­ for its accepting review.

4

So if we reverse that decision, we ­­ we

5

tell the Georgia Supreme Court, you're wrong; there is

6

an arguable basis for your accepting review.

7

ought to remand to that court, requiring them to accept

8

review, it would seem to me.

9
10

So we

How can we reverse them on ­­ on an issue
they ­­ they never considered?

11

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, that's what happened in

12

R.J. Reynolds.

13

identical situation where you had an intermediate

14

appellate court that had ruled, and then you had the

15

North Carolina Supreme Court denied review.

16

question was, do you issue the writ to the intermediate

17

appellate court or to the North Carolina Supreme Court?

18

And ­­ and this Court decided, and Justice Blackman,

19

writing for the court, said, "We want to give

20

practitioners" ­­ "We want to end the confusion about

21

this."

I mean, there you had almost an

And the

22

And so it goes to the State supreme court.

23

There is no difference in our situation here

24
25

and the situation that R.J. Reynolds ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But ­­ but you're saying in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6

that case or in other cases?

2

cases that, in that situation, we, nonetheless,

3

addressed the reasoning of the intermediate court?

4

that what you're saying?

5

MR. BRIGHT:

And if so, which other

Is

You ­­ you did in Sears v.

6

Upton, a case out of Georgia, 561 U.S. 945 in 2010.

7

That was certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia, but

8

it came up on exactly the same posture of our ­­ our

9

case.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there an argument that

11

the petition for certiorari could go to the trial court?

12

I mean, our statute says that it goes to the

13

highest court in which review could have ­­ could have

14

been had, I think is the ­­ the statutory phrase, in

15

which sounds like the Georgia Supreme Court.

16

On the other hand, as Justice Scalia said,

17

they haven't really directed their attention to the

18

issues before us.

19

I ­­ I ­­ I'm not sure to me that it's an

20

option to ­­ to go to the superior ­­ to the Georgia

21

trial court.

followed in Grady v. North Carolina last year ­­ 2015

case, this year, in which, once again, there was an

4

intermediate court decision denied by the ­­ the North

5

Carolina Supreme Court.

6

I mean, I can remember all the way back to

7

1960.

certiorari was to the police court in Louisville,

Look

If ­­

19

MR. BRIGHT:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Right.
­­ the Supreme Court has

21

said just "denied," nothing more than "denied," we look

22

back to the last reasoned decision.

23
24
25

Those are both decisions of this Court, and
that's what you're relying on.
MR. BRIGHT:

Well, and ­­ and they're not

mutually exclusive.

2

the last reasoned decision in making its decision in

3

this case, and I believe that's what it should do.

4

at the same time, the Court's opinions appear to us, on

5

the quick research we did over the weekend on this, that

6

R.J. Reynolds and ­­ and the subsequent case say that

7

certiorari would issue to the Georgia Supreme Court.

And ­­ and we listed it that way, and then
when the case was docketed here, it was listed that the
lower court was the superior court of Butts County.
JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the State supreme

court wrote a short opinion and said, We're not going to

13

determine whether there was, in fact ­­ the only issue

14

we're going to determine is whether there's any arguable

15

merit to this?

16

whether it was a correct application in Batson is ­­ is

17

the issue that we have to decide?

18
19
20

And then you say that the whole issue of

MR. BRIGHT:

I ­­ I ­­ I think in

R.J. Reynolds, I think that's this Court's law, yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Could I ask you another ­­ a

21

question about another preliminary issue before you get

22

to the ­­ the ­­ the underlying question in the case?

23

The Superior Court said, on page 175 of the

24

Joint Appendix, that the issue of the Batson violation

25

was not reviewable based on the doctrine of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

res judicata.

2

And then it later said, and this is 192 of

3

the Joint Appendix, that it will review the Batson claim

4

as to whether Petitioner has shown any change in the

5

facts sufficient to overcome the res judicata bar.

6

Now, if you put those two together, you

7

could argue that the superior court decided only a

8

question of State law, namely, whether the situation

9

here was such that there could be review of the Batson

10

claim.

11

What is your response to that?

12

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, the State doesn't argue

13

that.

14

Court said, we're moving ­­ the Court is going to

15

address step three of Batson.

16

Batson claim is without merit.

17

And I think the reason for that is because the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it said, Foster's

Well, but is it question

18

of Federal or State law as to whether or not the

19

Petitioner has shown a change in facts sufficient to

20

overcome the res judicata bar?

21

language that Justice Alito quoted, is that ­­ is that a

22

State law question or ­­

6

MR. BRIGHT:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

No, no, no.
I think you have to say

it's a Federal question.

9

MR. BRIGHT:

No.

In order to decide it,

10

the ­­ this is exactly like Ake v. Oklahoma, where the

11

court, the Oklahoma court had to decide the Federal

12

question in order to decide whether it had jurisdiction

13

over the issue.

court has to decide the Federal issue ­­ and it did in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Explain to me why deciding

the Federal issue was essential to its deciding the

22

State res judicata issue.

23

MR. BRIGHT:

Because it ­­ it ­­ it framed

the question as being that it would look at the

I thought it was whether

there ­­ there were changed facts sufficient enough.

before direct appeal.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Bright, did the

court, in your judgment, do de novo review?

say that it did ­­ basically, it was going to do step

three of the Batson charge ­­ challenge?

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

the merits.

After considering these other

16

facts.

And we think there was some legal errors made

17

there.

But yes, after considering these facts, the

18

court said that the claim was without merit.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The court said that it

20

would reach step three again on the basis of the new

21

evidence presented, and so they did it all over.

22

guess that's ­­ we must take that as what happened.

23

They did not apply a res judicata bar.

24
25

MR. BRIGHT:

No.

And I

I mean, in Ake this Court

said, when the resolution of the State procedural law

2

the State law prong is not independent of the Federal

claim.

And this Court has jurisdiction.

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's on page

Well, I don't want to

6

belabor the point too much, but you ­­ are you arguing

7

that Georgia res judicata law is this:

up with any new fact, the ­­ the ­­ the thinnest new

9

fact, that is sufficient to wipe out the res judicata

If someone comes

claim?

understanding of Georgia res judicata law?

13

Is that your argument?

MR. BRIGHT:

That's your

That's not my understanding.

My understanding is the evidence has to be sufficient

15

enough that the court does what it did in this case and

rule on the merits of the issue.

Because the court decided the

Batson issue to decide the underlying State law issue.

2

And I think Ake is pretty clear on this, and I commend

3

it to the Court's attention.

4

since the State had raised this, either in their

opposition to cert or in their brief, it's not briefed

on this.

that the prosecutors had identified the

African­Americans by race, they had rated them against

14

each other in case it came down to having to select a

15

black juror.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

The prosecutors said the

17

reason for concentrating on the black jurors was that

18

you had informed them you would present a Batson

19

challenge, and therefore, it was necessary for them to

20

see if there was a race­neutral ground for disqualifying

21

that case.

MR. BRIGHT:

whether he had done the same extensive background check

3

on all the jurors, white and black.

4

6

Did you find any evidence of that extensive
black background search?
MR. BRIGHT:

No.

The only ­­ what that's

7

talking about ­­ and ­­ and the investigator said this

8

in his deposition, was the color ­­ race­coded colored

9

list, those first four lists you have in the Joint

10

Appendix in which the blacks are marked with a "B" and

11

are highlighted in green with a marker up at the corner

12

saying green designates black.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So ­­ so your ­­ your

14

understanding of that statement was that all ­­ he had

15

only done an extensive search on the blacks on the list?

16

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, it's clear, Mr. Lundy had

17

prepared a ­­ a list, notes in which he talked about

18

just the black jurors in ­­ in the case.

19

the State concedes in its brief that the focus was on

20

the black jurors.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I think

During the trial, did

22

defense counsel, when he made his initial Batson

23

challenge ­­ not in the papers, but at trial ­­ did he

there is a laundry list suggests in and of itself that

did not suffice to create a Batson violation where none

MR. BRIGHT:

No.

Our position is that when

you look at the new evidence with all the evidence at

18

trial, that all relevant circumstances considered

19

together, considering that a lot of these reasons we now

20

know from the notes, we now know from the notes that

21

there were misrepresentations with regard to these

22

reasons.

23

Ms. Garrett on two bases:

That she was a social worker

2

was not a social worker, and secondly, the prosecutor

the strike.

Are you saying in answer

to Justice Scalia that when you had the notes, those

notes cast doubt on some of the prosecutor's

justifications in the first round?

10

MR. BRIGHT:

They ­­ they do that, and ­­

11

and they show misrepresentations to the court, and they

12

show an overarching goal of separating out the

13

African­American citizens, treating them differently and

Were we told that the

only three people who did the investigation on Batson

14

were the two prosecutors on the case and Mr. Lundy?

15

if Mr. Lundy says I didn't make that list, it has to be

one of the two prosecutors.

MS. BURTON:

It has to be one of the two

prosecutors, and one was not there on the day it was

And throughout,

49

the overall theme was, we don't want younger jurors.

We're looking for older jurors closer to the age of the

victim, age 79.

4

So I think ­­ you know, maybe ­­ I know it's

Working at Head Start with underprivileged children, a

9

make­or­break factor; a similarly situated white juror

also struck for that same purpose.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But ­­ but Ms. Burton, I

12

mean, wouldn't you agree, in a lot of these Batson

13

cases, you'll have purported justifications, which they

14

could support a valid peremptory strike, right?

15

that the question for a court is, well, but did they

16

support this valid peremptory strike?

17

what was the prosecutor thinking?

18

about purposeful discrimination, about intent.

But

In other words,

Batson is a rule

19

And so it doesn't really matter that there

20

might have been a bunch of valid reasons out there, if

about race.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, if his intent was to

4

good peremptory strike.

5

you know, someone or other might have been properly

6

struck by ­­ by a prosecutor isn't really the question.

The question is on the total amount of evidence before

8

us, including all these prosecutors' notes, what was

9

going on with respect to each of these peremptory

And so the question of whether,

strikes.

11

And then you have to deal with not just, oh,

it could have been this or it could have been that, but

really was, was they wanted to get the black people off

times ­­ and I know this Court's precedent on not asking

2

questions is particularly in voir dire as to people.

But as to a number of issues, I think when you're in

voir dire and you're asking questions, you don't

necessarily care what the answer is because with regard

to Mr. Hood, if he had said, yes, I have a son that's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE BREYER:

I ­­ I want to ask you a

4

different question before your time is up.

5

you to respond to the question that Justice Alito

6

initially asked.

7

MS. BURTON:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9
10

And I'd like

Okay.
And that is, is there an

independent State ground here?

Now, you're familiar

with the record.

11

MS. BURTON:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
And I read on page 192 of

13

the ­­ of your record the decision.

14

paragraph supports your ­­ the view that you would like

15

to hold, I think, that this is based upon res judicata,

16

which is a State matter.

17

And the first

And then there is the paragraph that was

18

read to you on page 195 and 196 where the judge says,

19

"The reason that I reach that conclusion is because the

20

notes and records submitted by Petitioner failed to

21

demonstrate purposeful discrimination on the basis that

22

the race was the basis."

23

to me.

24
25

Okay?

That sounds like Batson

And then he goes on to say, "And in addition
there is no good reason given, now or then."

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55

2

And then he concludes, "Accordingly, the
court finds the renewed Batson claim is without merit."

3

So if I read just that paragraph, I would

4

think the reason that the judge found in your favor is

5

he decided the Batson claim in your favor.

6

have to.

7

that's the ground he did go on.

He didn't

He could have gone on some other ground, but

8

But at worst, why isn't it ambiguous?

And

9

if it is ambiguous, then why don't we take, you know ­­

10

I think it's what's in the ­­ Long, you know, all those

11

cases.

12

assume that the judge went on the Federal ground?

If it's ambiguous, then aren't we required to

13

Now, that's both Alito's question.

Okay?

It's

14

what I think is the hardest point for you to overcome.

15

And I want to hear your response.

MS. BURTON:

18

I actually agree that it's

I think it's unclear.

MS. BURTON:

In ­­ in ­­ in this case, once

10

you have new facts or new evidence, if the Court in this

11

case finds that they can review the evidence anew and a

12

new review is had, then I think you are beyond that bar.

what you've just said.

MS. BURTON:

MS. BURTON:

Say it again.
Okay.

If you have ­­ if the issue has

18

been decided on direct appeal and you cannot go back to

19

it ­­ a superior court obviously can't overturn the

20

State's highest court.

21

such as in this case, and it is strong evidence, that

22

the court feels like it has to go ­­ it has to look at

23

that evidence ­­ and in this case it did ­­ then I think

24

you are beyond the res judicata bar.

25

But when you have new evidence,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, I mean, I think that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57

that's exactly how the decision is framed, right?

2

Because the decision talks about claims that are not

3

many claims, and then it lists a whole bunch of claims

that are procedurally defaulted.

Yes, I think it ­­ if ­­ if

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But doesn't Georgia have

11

the rule ­­ Georgia, the supreme court has said, Georgia

12

law allows claims to be revisited on habeas when new

13

facts have developed since the time of the direct appeal

14

because a claim that is based on facts that did not

15

actually exist at the time of the direct appeal, which

16

is this case, is essentially a different claim.

17

what the Georgia Supreme Court said.

MS. BURTON:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

That's

Yes.
New facts is essentially

a different claim.

Yes, Your Honor.
You may be right or wrong

MR. BRIGHT:

Thank you.

Very quickly, let

me first say that with regard to what Justice Alito

quoted that it's just come to our attention since the

trial of the case that Ms. Garrett cousin was arrested.

That was on May the 1st.

That was after the death

Secondly, if you look at the Joint Appendix
