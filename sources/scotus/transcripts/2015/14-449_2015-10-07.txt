ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

We will hear

MR. McALLISTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

The joint sentencing proceeding in these

11

cases did not violate the Eighth Amendment because each

12

defendant received the individualized sentencing

13

determination to which he was entitled.

14

Each presented all of the mitigating

15

evidence he chose to produce.

16

explicitly told the jury to consider each defendant

17

individually.

18

instructions, some that related only to one defendant or

19

only to another defendant.

20

The jury instructions

In fact, there were several separate

Each ­­ the jury for each defendant then had

21

to complete a specific verdict form, and this jury had

22

already proven its ability to distinguish between these

23

two defendants when it convicted one of some counts in

24

the original guilt phase, of which it acquitted the

25

other.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

The only way the Kansas Supreme Court gets

2

to an Eighth Amendment error in this case ­­ well,

3

really, there are two points.

4

possible, and one instance not even, violations or

5

errors of State law to find a prejudice that ­­ that

6

rose to an Eighth Amendment level.

7

disregarded altogether, with really no explanation, the

8

long­standing foundational principle that juries are

9

presumed to follow their instructions.

10

One, it relied upon

And two, it

The two State law errors, arguably, that ­­

11

the Kansas Supreme Court found, one was the admission of

12

evidence of the sister who made the comment about

13

Reginald may have told me he shot those people.

14

Well, that's not even an error of State law.

15

They said basically that's prejudicial.

16

have come in if they had been tried separately, but in

17

fact, that evidence would be relevant to aggravator

18

number 1, that the defendant killed multiple people.

19

That would have been admissible evidence and that ­­

20

that just can't be an Eighth Amendment violation.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It might not

But the Kansas ­­ the

22

Kansas Court found independent of the severance question

23

that there was constitutional error in the admission of

24

hearsay.

25

MR. McALLISTER:

That's the third question

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

presented in the cert position on which the Court has

2

not taken any action yet, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

But when it goes

4

back to Kansas, they can still say thank you for telling

5

us about severance, but we have this other ground that

6

leads to the same bottom line.

7

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, and we are certainly

8

hopeful that the Court will take another look at that

9

second question depending on its resolution of the two

10

questions that are in front of it today.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. McALLISTER:

13
14

But would ­­
But if it goes back in that

posture, yes, they would have another ground.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Was ­­ was any evidence

15

introduced with respect to one of the defendants that

16

could not have been introduced against the other had

17

there been severance?

18

MR. McALLISTER:

The only arguable evidence

19

really, Justice Kennedy, is what ­­ what Reginald refers

20

to as the corrupting influence.

21

arguably, would be relevant to the mercy consideration

22

to show his character, the nature of this person that is

23

being sentenced.

24
25

But even that,

And that was the notion that his mother
testified that sometimes ­­ of course, Jonathan looked

Alderson Reporting Company

up to his big brother, and maybe sometimes Reginald was

2

a bad influence on him.

3

the extent of that evidence.

4

in as a rebuttal to a mercy argument.

5

But that's ­­ that was really
And that might have come

The Kansas Supreme Court did not really

6

definitively say that was even State law error, but even

7

if you assumed it was ­­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. McALLISTER:

10
11

Could you tell me ­­

­­ it would only be State

law.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

­­ what the

12

constitutional standard you're asking us to apply?

13

this argument goes to harmless error; a serious position

14

to take, that even if there was error, no foul ­­ a foul

15

but no penalty.

16

I ­­

Okay?

But what standard are we applying?

We are

17

not applying the rule ­­ or are we or should we apply

18

the Rule 14 standard?

19

MR. McALLISTER:

No, not ­­ not for Eighth

20

Amendment purposes, Your Honor.

21

and I suspect the United States can propose something as

22

well, but it's a very high standard as an Eighth

23

Amendment matter.

24

content to accept something like it's a serious risk

25

that a defendant will not be able to receive

Kansas would propose ­­

And we would say ­­ we would be

individualized sentencing.

2

traditional notions of joinder with the Eighth Amendment

3

consideration, because that seems to be the only Eighth

4

Amendment consideration here, is the individualized

5

sentencing.

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it the Eighth Amendment

or is it due process?

8
9

It is sort of molding the

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, you could use a due

process standard, Justice Scalia, which we would also be

10

fine with.

11

infect the process with unfairness that the proceedings

12

are fundamentally unfair.

13

The question would really be, did joinder so

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That seems like a ­­ a

14

language that is relevant rather than the cruel and

15

unusual punishments language.

16

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, and that's exactly

17

what this Court said in Romano v. Oklahoma, a case in

18

which the defendant's other death sentence in a separate

19

case was admitted against the defendant in the

20

sentencing proceeding.

21

reversed, and the Oklahoma court said the jury should

22

not have heard about his other sentence as a matter of

23

State law.

24

Amendment violation, and it's a due process violation.

25

The Court said the Eighth Amendment doesn't have

That sentence later got

That defendant Romano said it is an Eighth

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

anything to say about what's admissible really.

2

State evidentiary rules, that's not an Eighth Amendment

3

issue.

4

That is

And the Court went on to address the due

5

process claim in Romano, applying that very standard.

6

And as we suggest the Court should do here, one of the

7

things it pointed to specifically was jury instructions

8

that said these are the aggravating circumstances you

9

may consider, you may not consider any others.

The

10

court said we presume the jury follows its instructions,

11

and nothing in the instructions gave the jury here any

12

way to give effect to that improperly admitted evidence.

13

And that's true here to the extent Reginald

14

Carr argues some of this evidence was really used as a

15

nonstatutory aggravating circumstance.

16

Kansas does not allow anything other than statutory

17

aggravating circumstances.

18

I think for Reginald, No. 7 for Jonathan ­­ very

19

explicitly and clearly say, here are the four

20

aggravating circumstances the State has alleged.

21

then the next paragraph, you may not consider anything

22

else as an aggravating circumstance.

23

By statute,

In the instructions ­­ No. 5

And

So in our view, the most the Kansas Supreme

24

Court could come up with is potential violation of State

25

law if, in fact, the evidence which is minimal in the

Alderson Reporting Company

10
1

greater scheme of this proceeding that Reginald was a

2

corrupting influence on Jonathan, if that would not have

3

been admitted, that's really all the Kansas Supreme

4

Court is left with to hang its hat on in finding ­­ in

5

saying there is an Eighth Amendment violation here.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you tell me if you're

7

aware, in other States or perhaps even in Kansas in

8

other trials, is it a common practice to sever when

9

there ­­ for the penalty phase when there are multiple

10

defendants?

11

MR. McALLISTER:

Justice Kennedy, I think in

12

the briefs ­­ I do not remember the exact page ­­ there

13

are two States that mandate severance ­­ one, Ohio ­­

14

and that's, I think, Georgia and Mississippi.

This is just for penalty

I think it's for the entire

presumption of ­­

together and you don't have one defendant having an

6

opportunity to preview the evidence that the State may

9

other joinder cases.

Of course, it has not had a

circumstances that's a factor.

record on the sentencing anyway and see do I really

think that this evidence that came in that the younger

one thought the older one was the monster, et cetera,

did it really have an effect?

all, if were you to do that, it would be quite clear.

5

The evidence is overwhelming.

But furthermore, the premise is not

supported really by the record.

8

whole strategy was to paint Reginald as the bad actor

here.

They say Jonathan's

That's not really what happened.

What they both

had some kind of psychological control over Jonathan.

comes from their mother.

18

a case, whether or not this is that case, in which it is

19

quite clear to a judge that each of two defendants is

saying, that was the bad actor.

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, not necessarily.

If

2

the high standard is met that it will not be possible,

3

perhaps, to give individualized consideration to each in

4

an Eighth Amendment or a due process standard is going

5

to be so fundamentally unfair, if you can meet that very

high standard, then ­­ but that's always been the

MR. McALLISTER:

Rarely, but I think it

would be ­­ certainly the Court has recognized in

14

Bruton, you have some sort of co­defendant confession ­­

I mean, confession situations, if there was something

16

that had not been used in the guilt phase, might be

17

relevant in the sentencing.

18

19

That might be so

We have tried to think of other examples.

20

might suggest something like one is claiming at that

21

point in time some kind of insanity, even though they

22

didn't succeed on that at trial.

23

really starkly contradictory in their presentations and

24

you were going to get a lot of evidence about one that

25

really had nothing to do at all with the other.

I

If there was something

Alderson Reporting Company

16

But we do believe it's a high standard that

2

would rarely be satisfied, especially given the Court's

3

long­standing presumption that the jury follows its

4

instructions.

5

here, the complaints that each makes in this Court.

6

First of all, at least one of those complaints really

7

wasn't even made in the Kansas Supreme Court, much less

8

the trial court, and that's the shackling of Reginald

9

and whether that might have prejudiced Jonathan.

10

And that's one thing I would point out

But they ­­ there was no complaints during

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The Kansas Supreme Court erred when it found

that the State violated the Eighth Amendment by

2

conducting joint sentencing proceedings for the crimes

the Respondents committed together.

this Court's cases hold.

Joint proceedings

They provide a fuller

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Ms. Kovner, is there

11

any difference between the Federal government's position

12

and the position of the State of Kansas on this

13

question?

14

MS. KOVNER:

As to the standard, I think

15

there's a small difference.

16

that the constitutional standard is whether evidence or

17

argument resulted in a denial of due process or the

18

deprivation of an individualized sentencing proceeding.

19

And that's slightly different from Kansas's

I think our proposal is

20

standard, because Kansas is proposing a rule that

21

involves analysis of risk, and we think that is part of

22

the statutory rule under Rule 14, as Justice Sotomayor

23

alluded to.

24

that states "by and large are applying," but we think

25

the constitutional question is just, was this person

It's also part of the statutory standard

Alderson Reporting Company

deprived of a fair trial by the evidence that came in?

2

And that's the constitutional question.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

When you said it the first

4

time, you had "deprived of a fair trial" and then

5

something about individualized sentencing; is that

6

right?

7

deriving both from the Due Process Clause and from the

8

Eighth Amendment?

9

Is that supposed to indicate that this is

MS. KOVNER:

Well, the Eighth Amendment does

10

speak to this need for an individualized sentencing

11

determination.

12

Clause also requires that proceedings be individualized.

13

But we would agree that if there were a situation where

14

there was a joint trial and because of the evidence

15

introduced by one, for instance, a jury simply could not

16

give individualized consideration to a second ­­ second

17

defendant, that would be a constitutional problem.

18

We would think that the Due Process

And to give an example of that ­­ I mean, I

19

think the example the Court suggests in Zafiro of that

20

is where there is aggravating evidence that pertains

21

only to one defendant, but that that aggravating

22

evidence is just so prejudicial and so overpowering that

23

the jury couldn't really separate the two and would be

24

inclined to sort of judge the second one by association.

25

So I think that's the example the Court

gives in Zafiro.

the question that Justice Kagan asked about whether,

making, that we're both going to point the finger at

each other at trial.

the jury's ability to reach an accurate verdict, to

22

reach an accurate assessment of relative culpability,

Zafiro

And what you need is substantial prejudice, even to have

If I may answer really briefly?

Your Honor, we think the reason that's the case is that

agree that accuracy and fairness considerations are at

their paramount in capital cases, but we do not think

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

minute you defend the idea of two different juries, then

you sacrifice the desirability and the possibility of

consistency.

4

MR. LIU:

Well, Justice Kennedy, there are

5

many ways that States have developed to resolve the

6

problem of inconsistent verdicts among different juries.

7

One way is what the Georgia State has done, which is had

8

proportionality review.

9

to look across many sentences to see if they are

10

They ask the appellate courts

inconsistent.

11

Another way the Federal government has a

12

solution to this, is that let one jury know how the

13

other jury sentenced the other defendant.

14

18 U.S.C. 3592(a)(4).

15

the problem of inconsistent verdicts across juries.

16

what's ­­

17

That's

And so there are ways to solve

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

That sounds ­­ that

18

sounds pretty prejudicial to me.

19

you say, oh, the jury considered this and individual

20

circumstances, you know, these people act together, and

21

by the way, a jury of your peers unanimously found

22

beyond a reasonable doubt that this guy should be

23

sentenced to death; now do whatever you want with this

24

guy.

25

If the second case,

That sounds pretty prejudicial to me.
MR. LIU:

Well, it's ­­ it's ­­ if you think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

that is prejudicial, Mr. Chief Justice, then this

2

proceeding was quite prejudicial too because the jury

3

was asked to make that same exact comparison.

4

But the specific prejudice we are alleging

5

here is ­­ is unique to these or at least quite ­­ quite

6

restricted to the circumstances of this case.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Liu, could you, for me,

8

just tell me what is the specific prejudice you're

9

alleging here?

In other words, tell me more than just,

10

oh, he was a corrupting influence.

MR. LIU:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure.
­­ and why do you think it

14

might have mattered to the jury?

15

like, best shot.

16

MR. LIU:

What evidence

Sure.

Just give me your,

Well, Kansas said there was

17

no expert testimony on this, but that's wrong.

18

Dr. Cunningham, at Joint Appendix pages 324 to 329,

19

explained how Jonathan looked up to Reggie, and every

20

time they would get together they would do drugs heavily

21

together, that when ­­ that when they were ages 6 or 7,

22

Reginald prompted someone to have sex with Jonathan.

23

These are precisely the sort of evidence that shows that

24

however bad you think Jonathan is, Reginald is worse

25

because Reginald is the one who created the person

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

Jonathan is.

2

It's in a sense making Reginald doubly

3

culpable for these offenses; that, well, whatever you

4

think Jonathan did ­­ and yes, as Justice Scalia read,

5

there were some horrific things done ­­ well, Reginald

6

should be punished for not only everything Reginald did,

7

but also everything Jonathan did.

8

So this is precisely the sort of evidence

9

that basically transfers all of Jonathan's actions to

10

Reginald.

11

get in the jury room, it's because it ­­ it skews the

12

weighing process.

13

And that's why it's so prejudicial when you

And a skewing of the weighing process is an

14

error this Court has recognized for 30 years.

15

How can you say

that what made the difference was the fact that your

2

client was a corrupting influence upon his younger

3

brother?

4

MR. LIU:

Well, Justice Scalia, the State

5

never established the identity of the shooter, and that

6

is the key horrific act in this case.

7

believed Jonathan was the shooter, then the jury might

8

have given him the death penalty anyway regardless of

9

what Reginald did to him.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If the jury

I doubt whether that is the

key.

trigger?

MR. LIU:

I don't think it's the only ­­ I

15

don't think it's the only thing, but it's certainly the

16

main thing given that we are here on a capital murder

17

charge.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you think that on a

retrial they cannot use the sister to prove that

20

Reginald claimed he was the shooter?

21

MR. LIU:

No.

And I think that just

highlights exactly how narrow our rule is.

evidence that Temica said that Reginald told her that

Reginald was the shooter goes to the circumstances of

the crime.

That the

a result, is not going to skew the weighing process.

The evidence.

And for reasons I ­­ I gave to

Justice Kagan, that evidence was extremely prejudicial.

10

It skewed the weighing process because it transferred

11

Jonathan's culpability back onto Reginald's shoulders.

12

If I may, I'd just like to address a few

13

points raised by my friend from Kansas.

14

instructions solve the problem.

15

instructions told the jury to consider this evidence

16

about the corrupting influence only as to Jonathan.

He said the

Well, none of the

17

Now, on the contrary, the instructions ­­

18

Instruction No. 2 told the jury consider the evidence

19

applicable to each defendant.

20

equally applicable to Reginald as it was to Jonathan.

21

After all, it was Reginald ­­ Reginald's actions that

22

were at issue.

Well, this evidence was

swath of evidence that the jury heard that it could

anti­mitigation evidence that the jury considered, could

Each of those cases recognizes that a skewing of the

weighing process has to be based on State law premises.

12

That's why this Court in Zant went so far as to certify

a question to the Georgia Supreme Court.

consider it.

20

it was part and parcel of Jonathan's mitigating

21

evidence.

22

But the mere admission of evidence isn't what
It's the admission of the

And it was required to consider it because

And this Court has said time and again that

23

a defendant has a constitutional right for the jury, not

24

only to consider but to listen to a defendant's

25

mitigating evidence.

So by considering this evidence

for Jonathan, the jury necessarily considered it against

corrupting influence on Jonathan, you can't separate

that as something for Jonathan and something for

After all, if you're told that Reginald had a

It's equally applicable to both.
My friend also suggested that we ­­ we

7

rejected a two­jury solution before trial.

8

rejected that, not because of it wouldn't work to solve

9

any prejudice in the penalty phase, but because it

Well, we

10

wouldn't work to solve any prejudice in the guilt phase.

11

And remember, the Kansas Supreme Court found

12

that it was actually error to keep the guilt phase

a two­jury solution at that phase of the trial.

that if the penalty phase is joined, he is going to have

to present evidence that, quote, "there's no way the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 14­449

12
13

MR. GREEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

I'd like to first try and change the

15

narrative here with some illustrations about the

16

difference between the mitigation cases of both

17

defendants.

18

experts.

19

That's easily seen in the testimony of the

Reginald Carr presented evidence from a

20

neuroscientist by the name of Dr. Woltersdorf that said

21

his client had been diagnosed a ­­ an incurable

22

sociopath.

23

Jonathan Carr's forensic psychologist,

24

clinical and forensic psychologist, got up and testified

25

that ­­ that Jonathan was sensitive, he was

That is ­­ that is a unique illustration of

5

exactly how different these two defendants were in their

6

presentation, and why, again, a sequential penalty

7

phase, even if they had been separate, wouldn't work.

Reginald says he didn't want to hear or he

On the other side, Jonathan doesn't want the

that's the evidence that would not have been introduced.
Justice Woltersdorf's ­­ or excuse me ­­

17

Dr. Woltersdorf's testimony about incurable sociopathy

18

would not have been relevant or admissible ­­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Maybe I'm missing something,

20

but if ­­ if your client's strategy was to make Reginald

21

as bad ­­ the bad actor in the case, why didn't that

22

evidence actually go hand in hand with your client's

23

strategy, which was to say it's all on Reginald?

24
25

MR. GREEN:

One ­­ one would think that it

would in ­­ in a typical case, and it may be that some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

jurors had inferred that way.

2

The problem was that ­­ that the fact that

3

the two brothers were sitting together allowed the

4

prosecutors to repeatedly paint them with the same

5

brush.

6

And ­­ and if we take a look, for example,

7

at JA 402, the prosecutor says to the jury in her

8

opening argument at the beginning of the penalty ­­ or

9

at the conclusion of the penalty phase, ladies and

10

gentlemen, they have the same eye color.

doesn't need them, they share some DNA.

It has to do with ­­ with Zafiro.

17

MR. GREEN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's the ordinary

case of joint trials, right?
And what the Court says is you can have the

21

joinder as long as there isn't a serious risk that the

22

joint trial would compromise ­­ it doesn't say harmless

23

error, it says compromise ­­ a specific trial right, or

have than to show that the juror ­­ jury wasn't

We should quote from Zafiro and

Now, that

Or are they the same thing in your opinion?
MR. GREEN:

Well, let me ­­ I think they're

3

the same thing and I think that's a generalization, but

4

we've ­­ we've offered a test that actually specifies it

5

a little bit more, Justice Breyer.

6

In terms of saying that ­­ that the test

7

should be whether there is a reasonable risk ­­ and I

8

will explain the difference between reasonable and

9

serious in a minute ­­ but whether there was a

10

reasonable risk that there would be evidence introduced,

11

material, prejudicial evidence introduced that would ­­

12

that would, in fact, not have been introduced in a

13

severed penalty­phase proceeding.

14

And to go back to Justice Kagan's question

15

about the intuitive difference between these two things,

16

they're between ­­ excuse me ­­ trials and ­­ and

17

penalty­phase proceedings, the answer is that's because

18

in a ­­ in a trial, the ­­ the relative culpability of

19

the defendants makes a big difference with respect to

20

who's a conspirator, who's not a conspirator, who's a

21

principal, who's an aider and abettor.

22

But when we turn to the penalty phase, the

23

inquiry changes, as Mr. Liu indicated ­­ it changes from

24

exactly what happened to who this person is and whether

25

or not the jury wants to put this person to death.

Alderson Reporting Company

advantage since they'll see all of the evidence

evidence here was overlapping, so that at least you'll

MR. GREEN:

what the State basically said was we're relying on our

evidence from the ­­ from the trial phase ­­ or from the

16

guilt phase of this capital trial.

jurors when they turned in to the penalty phase, and all

that the prosecution did in the penalty phase was

cross­examination is important.

The only Eighth

admission of evidence, they are about invalid

I ­­ I agree completely with

Justice Scalia's point, and the dissenting justice made

10

it in the Kansas Supreme Court:

11

corrupting influence evidence was so prejudicial to

12

Reginald, why did Jonathan also get a death sentence?

13

If the evidence ­­ the

And I would close by saying that we all

14

agree, I think, that the Constitution values accuracy

15

and fairness.

16

these individuals received an individualized sentence,

20

Kansas to go back.

22

into questions, separate proceedings, traumatizing

23

victims yet again.

24

at the end of the day they got a fundamentally fair

25

proceeding that gave each of them the sentence they

We would ask that you reverse the Kansas
Supreme Court on this point.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. McAllister, I am

6

sorry, but even if we do this and say that the

7

sentencings didn't need to be severed, didn't the Kansas

8

court hold on another ground that they were entitled to

9

a new trial?

10

MR. McALLISTER:

Yes.

So that's the third

11

question presented in the Petition, which my

12

understanding is that is something the Court could

13

reconsider.

14

Questions 1 and 3.

It's not denied.

The Court granted

15

The other question that we presented was the

16

only other ground that the Kansas Supreme Court gave for

17

reversal, that's a Confrontation Clause violation in

18

terms of some of the hearsay evidence presented in the

19

sentencing proceedings.

20

So if the Court were to reverse on these,

21

deny on that question, then the Kansas Supreme Court

22

could, in fact, rely on that ground.

23

be that the Court would do something different than that

24

if you reverse on these two questions.

25

But our hope would
