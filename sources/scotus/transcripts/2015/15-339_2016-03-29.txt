CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 15­339, Ross v. Blake.
Ms. Bernhardt.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIA DOYLE BERNHARDT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BERNHARDT:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:
In this case, the Fourth Circuit adopted a

11

nontextual exception to the requirement of the

12

Prison Litigation Reform Act that a prisoner exhaust

13

available administrative remedies.

14

if accepted, would eviscerate Congress's intent in

15

adopting the Prison Litigation Reform Act and

16

requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies.

17

In the Fourth Circuit States where this

That exception,

18

exception now applies, district courts are now

19

charged with examining prison procedures to see how

20

murky they are.

21

requirement of exhaustion at all if there's been an

22

internal investigation ­­

23

They are dispensing with the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

you think that that is no longer true?

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why do all of these

3

cases suggest that, when that happens, the ARP

4

throws out the case on the view that there's an IIU

5

investigation?

6

MS. BERNHARDT:

When this case arose in

7

2007, the warden was not required to dismiss it.

8

And so in some cases ­­ in some of the cases that

9

are before the Court, that is, indeed, what

10

occurred.

11

a collection of cases where there was a dismissal,

12

but ­­

13

There's cases with three wardens where ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you have any example

either side on that point.

And if I might

And so there was no evidence presented on

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, you've lodged now

7

quite a number of materials, and we can talk about

8

the materials that you've lodged, but now, you know,

9

both parties have lodged materials, and nobody has

10

come up with a case in which the ARP has adjudicated

11

a complaint when there was an IIU complaint

12

investigation going on; is that right?

13

MS. BERNHARDT:

That's right, Your Honor.

14

And there's a four­year retention policy for these

15

records, and this case arose in 2007.

16

17

briefing in this Court ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so this

But at least it would

19

show that there are papers staying ­­ saying as

20

clearly as it could possibly say, "You involved an

Couldn't be clearer.

So those letters say, unmistakably, "Your

complaint is dismissed because there is an IIU

5

what they say.

6

They can't just erase that.

MS. BERNHARDT:

Yes, Your Honor.

stage of the process.

11

And in Maryland, proper exhaustion is

12

always an appeal to the commissioner and then to

13

file complaint with the Inmate Grievance Office,

14

which holds a quasi adjudicatory hearing in every

15

one of these cases.

16

And all one need do is look at the

17

decisions in Petitioner's lodging.

18

were all IIU investigation cases, and all of these

19

inmates had a full adjudicatory hearing on the

20

merits, and some of them got substantial amounts of

21

money.

22

You'll see these

So there is an available remedy in Maryland

23

for prisoners who are assaulted by guards and where

24

there is an internal investigation.

At the time of this case

and today, the warden had discretion to reach the

merits of it or to administratively dismiss it.

9

Both of those are appealable orders.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Bernhardt, can I just

11

ask, because in the materials you lodged yesterday,

12

in three different places you appeared ­­ the office

13

appears actually to have a rubber stamp.

I mean,

it's the same stamp on all these things.

Since this case shall

That's on a rubber stamp.

20

MS. BERNHARDT:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the

21

procedure there is the same in any other

22

use­of­force case, and that is the first­level

23

decision; that is appealable to the commissioner.

24

And then once those two stages within the prison are

25

exhausted, the internal remedy has been exhausted,

because we thought that it raises a question of

whether the circuit can create an exception to the

thought we took it.

Let's talk about, then,

appealable decision on the merits that goes to the

16

we had a procedure that was ­­ that was available on

its face, and there was never any challenge to

18

availability.

19

to the internal affairs, and that serves the same

20

purpose.

21

The argument was that "Well, I went

I don't have to exhaust."
And that doesn't serve the same purpose.

22

All one need do is compare the criminal

23

investigation report at JA 185 with the

24

administrative law decisions that resolve the civil

25

claims.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

17

An IIU investigation doesn't produce an

administrative decision on a civil claim.

3

doesn't give an opportunity to settle civil claim.

It serves a completely different purpose.

9

And that has ­­ having a very bad

And one need only look at experience in the

10

Second Circuit to see the effect that's been there.

11

It's totally contrary to the purpose of the Prison

12

Litigation Reform Act.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have to say that when

14

I read the Fourth Circuit decision, there are lines

15

in the Fourth Circuit decision that seemed to be

16

deciding this on the burden of proof.

17

saying "Ross" ­­ meaning you ­­ "have offered no

18

evidence that would contradict Blake's belief that

19

the IIU's investigation removed his complaint from

20

the typical ARP process."

21
22
23

They're

And the Fourth Circuit, that's at 787 F.3d
700.
It goes on to say, moreover, that "the

24

handbook regulations and directives do not

25

contradict Blake's belief that he had exhausted his

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

18

administrative remedies by removing the incident to

2

senior corrections officers, thereby initiating an

3

IIU investigation."

4

That's ­­ that's at the same page.

5

So I'm not sure what the Fourth Circuit was

6

doing with availability.

7

what do I do with respect to Justice Breyer's

8

question and Justice Kennedy's question, which is,

9

is this a availability determination?

10

MS. BERNHARDT:

And so if I'm not sure,

The Fourth Circuit assumed

11

it was available.

12

Appendix 8, the district court found it was

13

available.

14

would certainly be appropriate, it seems to me, to

15

remand it to the Fourth Circuit so the Fourth

16

Circuit could sort out any availability issues that

17

have been newly raised.

18

presented to be decided because of the effect that

Second, we're asking this Court to reject

the part of Blake's argument in Part 2 of his brief,

which we think is fairly encompassed within the QP,

10

that a prison's procedure has become unavailable and

11

that a prisoner can jump to federal court as soon as

12

he could reasonably but mistakenly think that he was

done with the grievance process.

reasonable prisoner would not understand them.
MR. TRIPP:

Well, I think there's a big

21

difference between a reasonable mistake standard,

22

which is what the court of appeals held.

23

that he made a reasonable mistake, and Blake is

24

trying to repackage that as a gloss ­­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It held

I understand that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

24
1

that's different.

2

MR. TRIPP:

Right.

And that's the thing

3

that we have trouble with.

4

there are two big differences between the reasonable

5

mistake standard and an availability standard, which

6

is the correct statutory standard.

7

just the degree of uncertainty.

8
9

And ­­ and ­­ and so

The first is

If you have a body of regulations, it
doesn't take that much to say that reasonable minds

10

could disagree about some aspect of the procedure.

11

It is quite another thing to say that they are so

12

confusing that they can't even be used.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

What words should we use?

14

The statute uses the word "exhausted."

15

"exhausted" in administrative law, where it's most

16

frequently found, has a huge meaning, with

17

exceptions, built up over the years.

18

exception is for a procedural rule that is, quote­­

19

it comes from habeas corpus law ­­ "not firmly

20

established and regularly followed."

21

MR. TRIPP:

that I just said in administrative law?

5

And, three, how do you put it?

6

All right.

7

Now, you say what you wanted to

say, because you wanted to say something.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. TRIPP:

So I think the ­­ the point

10

that you're getting at about not regular followed is

11

that's better handled in a situation so ­­ at

12

Woodford and this Court's case law says that when

13

somebody has exhausted but has made some kind of a

14

procedural misstep, and the question is whether they

15

should suffer a procedural default, that ­­ that the

16

question there is, as this Court said in Woodford,

17

whether it's a critical procedural requirement.

18

we think that the natural analogue is what you're

19

talking about from habeas corpus law, that you would

20

be asking whether it's an adequate and independent

21

State ground similar to that.

And

22

The inquiry here is different.

23

here, he's just ­­ he's saying that it's just so

24

confusing that it's not available.

25

that the correct standard is the one that's said in

Alderson Reporting Company

The inquiry

And so we think

Booth, not capable of use for a purpose.

articulate it in our brief we think is correct.

3

you want to give some guidance, it's that no

reasonable prisoner can use it.

5

to ­­ to ­­ to get that far down in the weeds to

enough.

There's two big differences

between a reasonable mistake standard and ours.

first I was saying is just the degree of ambiguity.

can do one of two things.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. TRIPP:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

Can I ­­

­­ in the record.

And ­­

Can I ask, it seems to me

12

that there are three kinds of unavailability.

13

I'm wondering if you agree with each of the three.

14

One is where the prison says, you can get

And

15

your remedy over here.

16

you can't get your remedy over here.

17

prison here said, you can get your remedy at the

18

ARP, but you couldn't get your remedy at the ARP,

19

that's a kind of factual unavailability.

And then it turns out that

You agree with that?

6

MR. TRIPP:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the third is some of

these cases arise in the context where the State is

deliberately trying to interfere with or trick the

inmate or something like that.

We submit that the proper outcome of the

13

or, alternatively, to affirm.

14

If the Court were to consider affirming

to begin is what the term "available" means in the

17

statutory context.

18

We submit that ­­

that, the Fourth Circuit seemed to assume that there

20

was a procedure that was available.

that there ­­ this ­­ it was excused here even

22

though it was available.

And it held

Now, do you defend that argument?

MR. HUGHES:

25

disagree.

Your Honor, I ­­ I would

I don't think the court of appeals

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

31
1

thought that there was something that was available,

2

and it certainly did not think the State had met its

3

burden of showing so.

4

As was pointed out earlier, at Petition

5

Appendix page 13, the court of appeals said "Ross

6

has proffered no evidence that would contradict

7

Blake's belief that the IIU's investigation removed

8

his complaint from the typical ARP process."

9

And at the next page, Petition Appendix 14

10

to 15, the court of appeals added, "Ross has

11

provided no practical examples of an inmate being

12

allowed to file an ARP or IGO grievance during or

13

after an IIU investigation."

rule that ­­ that the Fourth Circuit adopted?

We think that's a correct

statement, yes, Your Honor.

is a correct understanding of implicit exceptions

25

that exist to exhaustion requirements.

We do think that that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

32

That said, we think the starting place here

2

should be the meaning of ­­ of the plain term

3

"available" that exists in the statute.

4

we're correct about what the term "available" means,

5

I don't think the Court necessarily needs to even

reach the ­­ the rule that was adopted by the court

of appeals.

And if

We think it was correct ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do we think that the Fourth

Circuit was wrong with respect to that?

I mean,

it's a problem leaving it on the books, isn't it?

11

MR. HUGHES:

Well, Your Honor, I think the

12

Court could, though, still, even if it thinks that

13

the court ­­ the court of appeals was wrong about

14

that, still recognize that the additional argument,

15

what the term "available" means in this context that

16

we're correct about, and that, for multiple reasons,

17

the system that Maryland has in place doesn't meet

18

any conceivable understanding of what available

19

would be.

20

So I think the Court could certainly do

21

that.

22

that the ­­ the court of appeals was wrong, but we

certainly think the starting place here is what

I have two

principal responses to that.
First, is the material that I just read

of appeals recognized that the ­­ the State had

of appeals ­­ mind you, after we got past the waiver

argument ­­ our first argument was waiver ­­ our

second on the merits of this ­­ was that when an IIU

investigation was underway, there was no ARP process

25

whatsoever.

Our principal

Our consistent argument was the State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

was in fact wrong.

We made that argument to the court of
appeals, which, I think, it ­­

19

to present a real serious problem of how we should

21

MR. HUGHES:

And it just seems to me

Well, first, Your Honor, I

22

still think it does only support our burden

23

argument, and ­­ and we still would think our burden

24

argument sufficient.

25

But, additionally, in the ­­ the papers to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

35
1

this Court, Maryland has consistently said that the

2

IIU and the ARP process were entirely distinct.

3

page 5 of the reply brief in support of certiorari,

4

for example, they explained the argument saying that

5

the 2008 directive codified then­existing practice.

They said that that was plainly wrong.

They said that in

MR. HUGHES:

Yes, Your Honor.

But what we

10

did in the lodging was we identified in part briefs

11

that the Maryland attorney general's office, the

12

office responsible for litigating these cases in

were ­­ made materially different representations on

reason that couldn't have been done before the

MR. HUGHES:

21

these materials, because they are briefs that the

Why should this issue of

availability be decided by this Court as opposed to

8

the district court or court of appeals on remand?

9

MR. HUGHES:

Your Honor, I certainly think

10

that could be one possible outcome if the Court were

11

to say that "available" as a legal matter means what

12

we think it means, but that there could be

13

subsidiary questions that would be left for remand.

14

We would not quarrel with that outcome.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

definition of "availability"?

MR. HUGHES:

I'm sorry.

Yes, Your Honor.

What's your

We think

18

that for a remedy to properly qualify as available

19

within the meaning of the PLRA, the prison system

20

must sufficiently inform an inmate as to which

21

administrative remedy he or she needs to use to ­­

22

to press a particular kind of claim and then

23

additionally needs to explain so a reasonable inmate

24

would know the steps that he or she needs to take to

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the difference

2

between that and what the statute used to say before

3

it was amended where it required exhaustion of such

plain ­­ plain, speedy, and effective administrative

remedies as are available?

MR. HUGHES:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, Your Honor.
I think it's saying it has

to be plain.

9

MR. HUGHES:

No, Your Honor.

I think there

10

is a substantial amount of daylight between

11

requiring administrative remedy on one hand to be

12

plain, on the other hand to have sufficient clarity

13

that a reasonable prisoner would understand how it

14

works.

15

And perhaps an example, a prison remedy

16

could ­­ a prison system could create administrative

17

remedy that is, in fact, quite complex, that has

18

several steps, perhaps some of the steps are

19

conditional based on the kind of claim an individual

20

is raising or based on the adjudication at the lower

21

steps.

22

That might be very complicated, but it

23

would be perfectly fine so long as the prison

24

accompanies that with sufficiently clear guidance

25

that a reasonable inmate would know how to actually

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think that there is

the solicitor general's standard?

standard is if the procedures are so confusing that

10
11
12

In other words,

That's his

Do you think that there is a difference
between yours and his?
MR. HUGHES:

Honestly, I don't think

13

there's a substantial difference, Your Honor.

14

think we certainly agree with the solicitor general

15

that a reasonableness is incorporated into this.

16

I

We disagree with the test that was

17

articulated in their brief at page 21 where they

18

suggest that the standard must be so high that, if

19

any conceivable reasonable inmate could satisfy the

20

test, that that would be sufficient.

21

We think that is certainly too high a test

22

because if one of a hundred or one of a thousand

23

inmates happens to get it right, that might not mean

24

it's a reasonable system; it just might mean if an

25

inmate is reduced to guesswork, sometimes the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

40
1

inmate's going to guess correctly.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is quite important to

3

me, and the solicitor general, I think, has ­­

4

has ­­ has made very clear why this is such an

5

important question, not just your client, but I mean

6

in general in the system.

7

The Fourth Circuit copied a full page of

8

what it said was the Second Circuit's special

9

exceptions test, and then it listed it.

And the

10

rest of the opinion that you cite really is meant to

11

be an application of that test.

12

talking about is simply the procedure leg of that

13

test.

14

What you were

So whatever words I or anyone else write

15

here are going to take on a lot of importance in the

16

prison system.

17

kind of thing happens.

18

So I'm nervous, as always, when that
I'm not an expert in it.

Now, there are several ways we could go.

19

mean, it sounds to me, even though I did write, and

20

I think correctly, that there are exceptions, such

21

as for constitutional issues, for example,

22

traditionally there is no exception for the

23

reasonable mistake.

24

sounds as if reasonable mistake is put best under

25

the rubric of availability.

I'm not aware of any.

Alderson Reporting Company

And it

I

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

41
1

Now, that's just tentative.

But if I'm

2

right in thinking that what we have here is simply

3

a ­­ an aspect of the availability question, then

4

maybe the thing to do is send it back and argue out

5

all the availability, including this, in the court

6

below rather than us trying to write a standard.

7

Or a second, maybe we adopt the SG

8

standard.

9

know what rubric we'd put it under.

Or maybe we adopt your standard.

10

rubric of exception?

11

availability?

I don't

Under the

Under the rubric of

Now, that's a general musing­type question,

13

designed to provoke on your part a general response.

14

MR. HUGHES:

15

the outcome here was correct.

16

our starting point.

17

there, the proper rubric that would apply in this

18

case and all other cases, is an understanding of

19

what "available" properly means.

20

Well, we certainly think that
So that's certainly

We think the best way to get

So I ­­ I would suggest, I think, the

21

statutory text and what "available" fairly ­­ has

22

been held to mean by this Court in Booth and

23

elsewhere does the work, certainly in this case, and

24

I think in the vast majority of cases.

25

As the Court said in Booth, "available"

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

42
1

here means "accessible or capable of use."

2

think anyone would fairly describe a prison

3

administrative remedy as one that's accessible or

4

capable of use.

5

I don't

A reasonable prisoner wouldn't know which

6

remedy it is he or she is supposed to use in the

7

circumstances or wouldn't know the proper steps that

8

he or she needs to take in order to avoid procedural

9

default under Woodford standard.

10

The system has to have that ­­ that minimal

11

degree of clarity for one to actually have been

12

described as available.

13

the word "available" after it amended the PLRA from

14

the prior CRIPA, and "available" must have meaning.

15

Congress certainly didn't say any standard ­­ or any

16

remedy or all remedies.

17

Certainly Congress retained

And, again, I don't think Maryland even

18

disagrees with us on this point because they say at

19

the reply brief at page 5, they agree that if the ­­

20

if the administrative remedy, in their words, is

21

undecipherable, that would not be one that qualifies

22

as available.

23

So I think there's broad agreement that

24

the ­­ the prison system can't take the rule book,

25

lock it in a box, not let any inmate understand how

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

43
1

it works, and still call that system one that is ­­

2

is fairly available.

3

So ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If I could understand you,

4

though, I mean, one argument that you would have,

5

whether here or below or ­­ is this notion of the

6

prison system didn't meet this level of clarity,

7

whatever it is.

8
9

But there's another argument, don't you
think ­­ or do you think ­­ that you have, which is

10

just, they said to go to the ARP, and the ARB ­­ the

11

ARP was not in the business of giving this remedy.

12

So we did exactly what we were told to do, and it

13

turns out the remedy is unavailable because it's

14

just not available.

15

MR. HUGHES:

I think that's precisely

16

correct.

17

here, in all of the cases that anyone has

18

identified ­­ and, again, with both our lodging, but

19

also in every case in Petitioner's lodging ­­ and I

20

just point the Courts to their lodging at page 25,

21

32, 37, 46, 93, 231, and there are others.

22

example that anyone has identified, the ARP has

23

always said, "You've come to the wrong place.

24

Because of the IIU is underway, there can be no

25

relief had here."

I absolutely agree with that view, that

I think that's plainly an

Alderson Reporting Company

Every

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

44
1
2

unavailable system.
As the Court in Booth said for ­­ in a

3

system, administrative remedy to qualify as

4

available, the administrative officers must have

5

some authority to provide relief in the

6

circumstances.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't ­­ I don't

8

mean to beat a dead horse, but the ­­ the citations

9

you cited, it is true that that's to the lodgings.

10

But I don't have any confidence that these lodgings

11

represent the complete universe to allow me to make

12

a judgment about the procedures under Maryland law,

13

because this wasn't litigated or ­­ or subject to

14

discovery in the district court or court of appeals.

15

MR. HUGHES:

So, your Honor, two things.

16

First, again, we would not disagree if ­­ if a

17

remand could be appropriate for some of these

18

issues; but, second, I think there is enough that is

19

undisputed in the ­­ the record currently that ­­

20

that doesn't even require a look in ­­ in the hole

21

to the lodgings to find that this was not an

22

available system.

23

To begin with, the IIU exclusivity

24

regulation that we discussed at page 17 of the red

25

brief made quite clear at the time of this incident

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

45
1

that the IIU had exclusive authority whenever there

2

was a referral that was made to the IIU at that

3

point and that no other agency could proceed.

4

That, again, has nothing to do with the

5

lodging material and, I think, makes quite clear

6

that the ARP was not the proper place to go.

7

We have the additional briefs, which we

8

think are on somewhat different footing than some of

9

the ­­ the other agency materials, and we have the

10

2008 directive that did happen after the case but

11

made quite clear that the ARP is simply the not ­­

12

not the correct place for these cases to go.

13

So I think all of these things, even

14

independent from the lodgings, demonstrate that

15

there was an enormous amount of confusion as to how

16

the system works and is not one that could be

17

described in any sense as available without even ­­

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

You would argue that even

19

if the ARP procedure turns out to have been

20

available as a formal matter, suppose that this ­­

21

that issue were remanded, and the district court

22

explored it thoroughly and concluded that, although

23

there's a lot of ­­ there are these materials that

24

might suggest otherwise, as a formal matter, it is

25

available, even when the IIU procedure is going ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

46

2

is going forward.

All right?

I don't know whether that would happen.

3

Maybe it wouldn't.

4

You would still argue that the procedure was

5

unavailable because, although it was available as a

6

former matter ­­ a formal matter, it is simply too

7

confusing; right?

8

take advantage of it.

9
10
11
12
13
14

Assume that that's the case.

And no reasonable inmate could

MR. HUGHES:

That's right.

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's a separate

agreement?
MR. HUGHES:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

So ­­

and ­­and that is why I ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

As to that argument,

15

your ­­ your client did not try to use any

16

procedure; isn't that correct?

17

MR. HUGHES:

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

MR. HUGHES:

No, Your Honor.
How was he confused?

So on the day of the event ­­

20

this is at the Joint Appendix, page 229 to 230, he

21

filed a very detailed report of the incident.

22

he said, at the bottom of ­­ of page 229 ­­ this is

23

three and four lines from the bottom ­­ "I'm asking

24

for a formal internal investigation."

25

page, after his signature, "P.S.

And

The next

I will repeat this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

47

exact statement under oath at any time you need.

2

3

He filed this very clear report that

4

described the entire incident.

5

prison to respond.

6

the next day.

7

And he asked for the

The prison did in fact respond

It instituted the IIU investigation.

So I think the question is, after he had

8

taken this clear affirmative step, would someone in

9

these circumstances, a reasonable prisoner, known

10

that he had to do something else?

11

everything that ­­ that we know shows that a

12

reasonable prisoner wouldn't have understood he had

13

to do anything else beyond the IIU investigation.

14

So, again, I think very clear affirmative steps he

15

took.

16

he had to go to the ARP process?

17

known because of the IIU exclusivity regulation.

18

wouldn't have known because of the practice in

19

Maryland prisons.

20

And I think

And the only question is, would he have known
He wouldn't have
He

And even if he had shown up there, we now

21

understand that in all cases, it was dismissed.

22

There was a rubber­stamp that was used to dismiss

23

all of these claims.

24

he wouldn't have known to have gone there; and if he

25

had gotten there, he would have shown up to a place

So for both of those reasons,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

48
1

that was going to dismiss ­­

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

He received ­­ he received

3

materials from the prison saying that that ­­ the

4

ARP procedure is available in cases of ­­ of

5

excessive use of force; isn't that right?

6

MR. HUGHES:

He did, Your Honor, but none

7

of that material said anything whatsoever about the

8

IIU.

9

specific, and generally the specific is going to,

The IIU exclusivity regulation, however, was

11

very specific IIU mechanism is exclusive, all other

13

agencies ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so on the

What did he see that said

that the IIU procedure was specific?

16

MR. HUGHES:

MR. HUGHES:

Well, it ­­ it was in the ­­

Was exclusive?

It was in the ­­ the

19

regulations that ­­ again, all of the regulations

20

that Maryland had enacted that would be available to

21

prisoners ­­

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23

MR. HUGHES:

And he read those?

No, Your Honor, I don't think

24

there is direct evidence that he read those, but I

25

think the question is what an objectively reasonable

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

49
1

prisoner would have understood.

2

guidance that was specific to the IIU that had

3

anything to do ­­ that would inform a prisoner, once

4

you're in the IIU channel, what is it that you

5

should be doing at that point, said this was the

6

exclusive mechanism; all other agencies have to

7

relinquish authority.

8

guidance would certainly trump the broad policy

9

statements that exist in the other regulations in

And the only

So I think that very tailored

10

the Maryland handbook that say nothing whatsoever as

11

to an inmate as to what he should do when the IIU

12

investigates.

13

I should also add that one of the

14

interesting things about this case is the IIU

15

investigations are the investigations where the

16

Maryland prison itself, it initiates them, because

17

it thinks those are the most serious incidents in

18

the prison.

19

own prison officials may have engaged in criminal

20

wrongdoing, and therefore they need to undertake

21

this process.

22

created very substantial trips and traps for only

23

the cases that are most likely to correspond to the

24

very worst conduct in Maryland prisons.

25

That's where Maryland thinks that its

What Maryland has done is ­­ is

So I think that's a particularly pernicious

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

50
1

aspect of creating the system where you're confused,

2

told to go to the ARP, but then the ARP, in all

3

cases, is going to dismiss your claim, telling you

4

that you've come to absolutely the wrong place.

5

And, again, I think all of the material at

6

this point is ­­ is totally consistent on the view

7

that this is how the ARP would have worked.

8

codified by the 2008 directive that we discussed at

9

the red brief at page 18, and I think there is

10

little question at this point that there was a

11

codification of existing practice that happened in

12

2008, because all of the examples anyone has

13

identified is consistent with the view that the 2008

14

directive served to codify what was ­­

It was

Sorry?
The recent amendment.

It's at page 367 of the Joint

Appendix.
And this is part of the directives.

22

It's ­­ it's a long directive that provides several

23

different pieces of guidance as to how the ARP

24

procedure works.

25

Joint Appendix page 367, it explains:

And at ­­ towards the bottom of

Alderson Reporting Company

"The warden

2

dismissal of a request for procedural reasons when

complaint is the same basis of an investigation

5

6

additional details, and it says ­­ it provides the

7

text that now appears on the rubber­stamp, which is,

8

"Your request is dismissed for procedural reasons.

It provides some

13
14
15

"Since this case shall be

So this is, I think, a quite clear
regulation as to how the system now works.
I will note that Maryland's view at ­­ at

16

footnote 9 of their reply brief is that even today,

17

notwithstanding this new directive, their view is

18

the way the system works is a prisoner still has to

19

go to the ARP to properly exhaust their claims in

20

these circumstances, despite the fact that this

21

regulation, I think, is crystal clear that, if you

22

do so, your claim is going to be denied.

23

And you're not told, contrary to the

24

suggestion that you would be ­­ you would know to

25

appeal, you're not told that you should appeal this

because you've told ­­ been told you have come to

4

the wrong place, the proper thing is just to keep

5

appealing it.

6

dismissed because of the IIU investigation.

7

think a reasonable prisoner would be quite clearly

8

led to believe that the IIU is, in fact, the only

9

thing that needs to happen in his particular case

There is not a shred of

You're told that you're ­­ it's being

10

11

appealing.

12

So I

So I think it's ­­ it's much more likely

13

that it's the unreasonable prisoners who disregard

14

the clear guidance that they're getting who continue

15

to appeal in these circumstances.

16

Now, one additional point:

The ­­ Maryland

17

referenced the McCullough case, saying that there is

18

State authority that ­­ that indicates that the

19

Inmate Grievance Office is the exclusive avenue for

20

these kinds of cases, and it rests on the McCullough

21

case here.

22

I think that argument is misplaced.

The McCullough case that they cite was

23

decided in 1989.

24

that's at issue here was not established until 1999,

25

a full decade later.

The internal investigative unit

So I think the ­­ the use in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

53
1

the reply brief of the McCullough case to say that

2

the IGO is this broad­based mechanism is not

3

responsive in any event to what happens now with the

4

IIU investigation, because the IIU simply didn't

5

exist at the time that ­­ that the McCullough case

6

was decided.

7

So I think that our view is quite clear

8

that if Maryland's system in this case were

9

endorsed, that would become a very clear model for

10

what other prisons could enact, this sort of

11

upside­down system, where you're told you have to go

12

to the ARP process to properly exhaust, but once you

13

get there, you're told that you've absolutely come

14

to the wrong place and, despite any guidance, you

15

have to somehow know that you need to appeal,

16

contrary to the instructions that you're being

17

given, in order to properly exhaust your claim.

18

As the Court said in Woodford, to properly

19

exhaust and to avoid procedural default, the

20

prisoner needs to use the steps that the prison

21

properly holds out.

22

very opposite of holding out these steps as

23

available to the prisoners.

24

you've come to the wrong place; you're using the

25

wrong steps.

Here, the State is doing the

The State is saying,

That can't be what I think the Court

Woodford.

I would be pleased to take any more
