CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 14­844, Bruce v. Samuels.
Mr. Shelley.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY F. SHELLEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHELLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are at least three reasons why the

11

Court should adopt what the courts of appeals have

12

called the per­prisoner approach under PLRA

13

Section 1915(b)(2).

14
15
16

One, the per­prisoner approach best comports
with the statutory text.
Two, the per­prisoner approach is the only

17

one consistent with the careful balance Congress struck

18

between deterring frivolous prisoner lawsuits and

19

preserving their right to bring meritorious ones.

20

And three, the per­prisoner approach avoids

21

anomalies and disincentives that Congress could never

22

have intended, disincentives such as discouraging

23

prisoner work by taking one hundred percent of their

24

income month after month.

25

I would like to, of course, start with the

text.

2

second sentence of Subsection (b)(2).

3

following:

4

shall forward payments from the prisoner's account to

5

the clerk of the court" ­­ singular ­­ "each time the

6

amount in the account exceeds $10 until the filing

7

fees" ­­ plural ­­ "are paid."

The key sentence is in ­­ the key sentence is the
It says the

"The agency having custody of the prisoner

The combination of that singular, clerk of
the court, and filing fees, plural, indicates the

10

per­prisoner approach because it means one clerk is to

11

13

Filing fees, the plural, appears in the ­­

twice.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can't there be more than

one filing fee for a single court?
MR. SHELLEY:

No, there cannot, not in the

20

way Congress understood the term in the PLRA.

21

look to (b)(1) and (b)(3), Congress creates it almost as

22

a term of art.

23

with the word "filing" in front of "fee," a filing fee

24

includes all of the subsidiary costs to start up a case.

25

If you

A filing fee includes ­­ a filing fee,

So a court of appeals, for instance, has a

referred to as a ­­

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what happens if you

4

have ­­ the district court makes an order, there has to

5

be a filing fee?

6

MR. SHELLEY:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the district court?
Yes, and then that fee is

8

not totally paid.

9

there's a cost award in addition.

In fact, the prisoner loses, so
And then it goes up

10

to the court of appeals, where there's another filing

11

fee.

12

MR. SHELLEY:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Right.
Does ­­ does ­­ on your

14

reading, does the court of appeals filing fee also have

15

to wait until the district court filing fee is fully

16

paid?

17

MR. SHELLEY:

Yes.

There would be an

18

initial partial filing fee that's paid upon the ­­ the

19

filing of the appeal.

20

20 percent initial partial filing fee that would be

21

assessed against the prisoner.

22
23

Under Subsection (b)(1) there's a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that would be across

the board that you always have to pay.

24

MR. SHELLEY:

But the second filing fee, the one from the

court of appeals, would line up.

2

fee from the district court would be paid off first, and

3

then sequentially the court of appeals would be paid

4

off, but only 20 percent would be taken every month from

5

the prisoner.

6

So the first filing

You wouldn't take 40 percent.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If he files enough cases,

7

he's never going to have to pay for it, right?

8

you know, he files 20 cases, that 20 percent will

9

never ­­ will never come home to roost.

10
11

I mean,

What ­­ what's the disincentive for him ­­
for his continuing to file cases?

12

MR. SHELLEY:

Well, first of all, it would

13

come to roost back in 1995 when Congress enacted the

14

statute because the filing fee for a district court case

15

was only $120, and a court of appeals was 105.

16

prisoner who earned, say, 55 or 100 ­­ 50 or $100 a

17

month, which is not outlandish given the small wages,

18

could pay off a filing fee in a ­­ in a matter of months

19

under that.

20

And so a

It's much higher now.
But to get to the rest of your question,

21

Justice Scalia, there are a number of other things in

22

the statute that work in tandem with (b)(2) to stop that

23

kind of behavior.

24

fee.

25

There's the three­strikes rule, which comes into being.

So there's the initial partial filing

He or she is always going to have to pay that.

Alderson Reporting Company

There's the ability of the district court or court of

2

appeals to sui sponte dismiss under the PLRA those cases

3

that are frivolous.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

So ­­ so you

5

say there are disincentives, but this was intended to be

6

a disincentive.

7

disincentive?

Was this not intended to be a

8

MR. SHELLEY:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was and it is.
I'm pointing out that it's

10

a very ineffective disincentive if the person keeps

11

filing a lot of cases.

12

MR. SHELLEY:

Well, it's not an ineffective

13

disincentive because it creates months and months more

14

of additional income being garnished.

15

with the others.

16

wholly barriers to filing a lawsuit.

18

added disincentives.

19

So it lines up

22

much on the scale to kill all of those cases.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so it didn't

Mr. Shelley, can we go back

24

to the sentence that you're relying on, because I have

25

to admit I don't understand your reading.

Alderson Reporting Company

The ­­ the

Official

8
1

sentence says ­­ and I'm taking out some unnecessary

2

words.

3

the clerk, singular, until the filing fees are paid.

4

It says, the agency shall forward payments to

Now, that makes perfect sense if the filing

5

fees are all in one case, going to a single clerk.

6

if you're right and what they mean is the filing fees

7

are in multiple cases, then it doesn't make sense to say

8

that the agency shall forward payments to the clerk.

9

The only way to make that sentence makes sense, if the

But

10

filing fees are in multiple cases, is for Congress ­­ is

11

for the statute to have read, the agency shall forward

12

payments to many clerks or to several clerks seriatim.

13

And that suggests not the per­prisoner approach, but the

14

per­case approach.

15

MR. SHELLEY:

I think that's incorrect

16

because I think what ­­ what you should insert, if ­­ if

17

necessary, in front of the clerk of the court is the

18

relevant clerk of the court.

19

are going to distribute to the relevant clerk of the

20

court.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So the prison officials

But then ­­ so that ­­ that

22

seems right, to make the sentence work the way you want

23

it to work ­­ and this is the sentence you are relying

24

on.

25

have to add language to it.

To make it work the way you want it to work, you

Alderson Reporting Company

9
1

MR. SHELLEY:

You ­­ you do not, because

2

there's still ­­ there's one clerk of the court, and

3

there's always going to be a clerk, because every case

4

the filing fee is paid to a clerk; so there's always

5

going to be the clerk of the court.

6

cases ­­ in ­­ in all cases, there's only one filing.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And ­­ and in most

Yes, I'm going to say, you

8

know what, even as I look at that, even if you add that

9

language, it still doesn't make sense.

"The agency

10

shall forward payment to the relevant clerk until

11

multiple filing fees are paid."

12

doesn't ­­ the two halves of the sentence don't connect

13

there.

14

MR. SHELLEY:

It's just ­­ it

Well, the filing fee's plural.

15

It ­­ it can't allow for the ­­ for the per­case

16

approach, the opposite approach, because filing fees we

17

know means more than one.

18

than one, because in (b)(1) and (b)(3) Congress used

19

this term of art to mean filing fee encompasses.

20

the thing that comprises all of the other fees.

21

And so it has to mean more

It's

And so I would say that the opposite side is

22

the one that cannot make any textual sense out of that

23

sentence, because there's never more than one filing fee

24

from a ­­ to a single clerk.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but Congress doesn't

Congress just thinks fees in a case, fees in

So then it makes perfect sense.

6

MR. SHELLEY:

But you're saying give fees in
It's give

It's give the fee to that

7

clerk that that clerk is owed until all the fees are

8

paid.

9

are paid.

10

You keep going back to a clerk until all the fees
So ­­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't ­­ isn't the

11

statute drafted, though, that with a single­case focus,

12

that is, 1915 throughout, talks about an action?

13

MR. SHELLEY:

Not ­­ not true.

First of

14

all, the whole purpose of the statute was to deal

15

with ­­ with multiple filers.

16

comes into it with a purpose of dealing with individuals

17

who file many cases.

18

So the whole ­­ Congress

But second of all, the three­strikes rule

19

assumes numerous cases.

20

Section 1915(d), which has the statutory language, "The

21

officers of the court shall issue and serve all process

22

and perform all duties in such cases."

23

And I'd also point to

So there are references to more than one

24

case in various plays.

25

singular way, in a way to deal only with one case, that

But even if it was written in a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

really doesn't prove anything against us.

2

you got to look to other statutory construction tools,

3

because it would just say that there's going to be an

4

initial partial filing fee in every case.

5

needs to be installment payments in every case.

6

It just means

And there

And we don't disagree with that.

We agree

7

that there are installment payments in every case, and

8

it's just a matter of when.

9

answer when, necessarily, right off the bat.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the statute doesn't

But why is the initial

11

fee ­­ the initial partial fee, you say each time you

12

file it, you've got to pay that?

13

the same way?

Why shouldn't that go

14

MR. SHELLEY:

Well, the ­­ the two sections

15

are written differently.

(b)(1) is very different from

16

(b)(2).

17

official.

18

mentions filing fees, plural.

19

filing fee, singular.

20

second ­­ in the second ­­ in (b)(2) but not in (b)(1).

21

So they ­­ they are a little bit different.

It's a different collector.

One is the prison

The other is the clerk of the court.

One

The other only mentions

There's a $10 rule in the

But even if ­­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you don't know ­­ I

mean, I can't get anything out of the second sentence,

25

to tell you the truth, because I think that a prison is

usually within a single district.

2

worried about a multiple filer, what he does is he files

3

about 15 cases in the same court.

4

And so when you're

And ­­ and therefore, it's perfectly

5

understandable why Congress would refer to multiple

6

fees, because they are going to be like ten of them.

7

It's the people they are really worried about are ­­ are

8

what's at issue.

9

second sentence.

10

So I can't get anything out of the

It's the first sentence that ­­ that is, it

11

seems to me, both your strength and your weakness.

12

There it talks about after payments of the ­­ the

13

initial partial filing fee.

14

talking about a case.

And so what do we do about that?

15

I mean, there it is.

"After the initial partial filing

16

fee, the prisoner shall be required to make monthly

17

payments of 20 percent," et cetera.

18

have the word "fee."

19

MR. SHELLEY:

Okay.

It sounds as if it's

That's where you

Well, first of all, I don't

20

think Congress necessarily had in mind a prisoner who is

21

filing numerous cases in the same court, because if you

22

look up to (a)(2), for instance, it talks about the

23

prisoner having to file a statement of his indigency.

24

And Congress talked about it needed to be obtained from

25

the appropriate official of each prison at which the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

prisoner is or was confined.

2

And the government concedes that prisoners

3

are moved around all the time, and therefore, there are

4

numerous districts ­­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:
exclusive.

7

MR. SHELLEY:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

I don't mean it's

Sure.
I'm just giving you an

explanation as to why they might have used the words

10

"fees," even though they previously defined a filing fee

11

of $350.

12

MR. SHELLEY:

So then let's go to that first

13

sentence in ­­ in the statutory text in

14

Subsection (b)(2).

15

partial filing fee is assessed, the installment payments

16

will also start to kick in.

17

they line up or do they ­­ or do they come first.

18

We don't disagree that after a

It's just a matter of do

So I don't think under that ­­ I don't think

19

(b) ­­ (b)(2) in that first sentence then would answer

20

the question.

21

you also get an installment payment after the payment of

22

the initial partial filing fee.

It ­­ under our theory, you also get a ­­

23

But ­­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

In terms of one of your

purposes, why isn't the government's concession that in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

no circumstance can a fee 20 percent be taken until ­­

2

unless it's above $10?

3

your problem?

4

Why doesn't that take care of

MR. SHELLEY:

Because I don't think the

5

government's position is ­­ is statutory allowed.

6

you take a situation where, let's say $11 was earned by

7

the prisoner the ­­ the previous month, and that's all

8

that was in the account.

9

take ­­ under the statute, you meet the statutory terms.

So if

In that case you'd have to

10

There's $10 in ­­ in the account, and you have to take

11

20 percent.

12

if there's over $10.

13

government would say, we're not going to take the 20

14

percent because it's going to send it under $10.

15

that ­­ that can't work out.

16

"Shall" is the word.

Shall take 20 percent

Well, there's $11 in there.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

So

No, what the

17

government ­­ I understand ­­ and they'll correct me ­­

18

is I think they are saying that if you pay a ­­ the

19

initial filing fee, and you're down to $8, they can't

20

take another 10 ­­ another 20 percent.

21

MR. SHELLEY:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

Well, that's ­­
That's how I understood

their concession.

24
25

Sure.

MR. SHELLEY:
position.

So that was their alternative

But even that one won't hurt our purposes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

argument, because if you take a prisoner who now, let's

2

say, he has $55 in income.

3

because if you earn 35 cents an hour and you work a

4

40­hour week, you have $55.

5

first four encumbrances will take $11 each, $44, leaving

6

you at $11.

7

amount, cause you have got a fifth encumbrance and

8

you're over $10.

9

And that's not outlandish

In that situation, the

The last one is going to take the whole

So under even this alternative approach, you

10

take 100 percent of the income every time the income is

11

more than $55.

Maybe I should go through that again.

12

Okay.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

So ­­
If you're clarifying it,

14

$11, I guess you'd take a dollar.

15

what's unclear?

16
17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

I mean,

If you're at 55, you

take 10.

18

MR. SHELLEY:

The statute says 20 percent if

19

it exceeds $10.

20

the ­­ after the fourth one, you have to take the fifth

21

20 percent increment ­­

22

So if you have $11 in there after

that way.

24

administering this that way?

25

They can't administer it

I mean, is there somebody who is

MR. SHELLEY:

Every circuit who has looked

Alderson Reporting Company

at it has described the per­prisoner approach as one

2

that as long as there's $10 in the account, it's the

3

trigger.

4
5

You can take the whole income.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And they are really doing

that?

6

MR. SHELLEY:

As far as I know, yes.

Well,

7

the BOP says it is not.

8

many of the prisoner are, are doing exactly that.

9

we showed two ­­ we cited two district court cases where

I understand the States, where

10

they went over what the States were doing, and they

it down to zero.

Congress, it seems to me, has written the statute

exactly the way you say.

10

MR. SHELLEY:

I agree.

I

I agree with that.

11

The only possibility is that alternative approach they

12

say, where they stop after the first one goes below $10.

13

But that one takes 100 percent of the income and helps

14

us in proving the per­prisoner approach, because in most

cases, where there's any ­­ any ­­ any job or wage

take 100 percent because the last 20 percent increment

will be above the $10 threshold.

It's a statement in an adversary brief.

are ­­ there are a number of machinations that can be

this ­­ this idea or that idea, and the government comes

up with alternative ones that they're not even using to

approach is you read the statute the way it ­­ the way

MR. SHELLEY:

First of all, Mr. Bruce didn't

unsettled in the lower courts, which is does the amount

divided about that, with the Fifth Circuit saying, yes,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This statute is written from the perspective

21

of a single case.

22

each action or appeal, it provides a list of things for

23

the Court to do:

24

indigency, to check for three strikes, and as relevant

25

here, to require full payment of filing fees on an

And what I mean by that is that for

To check for the affidavit of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28

2

installment schedule.
So what we're talking about here is

3

Subsection (b), which is the filing fee provision, and

4

it says, first, that an IFP prisoner has to pay the full

5

amount of each action or appeal, talking about a single

6

action or appeal, and then it sets out an installment

7

plan, which is an initial payment and a monthly payment.

8
9

So we're at the point where Petitioner
agrees that the initial payment is for each case, but

10

the ­­ he says that the statute somehow shifts

11

perspective to all of an inmate's cases when it starts

12

talking about the monthly payments.

13

And we just don't think there's any kind of

14

clear explanation in the statute that does that.

15

think the burden should be really on him to show a shift

16

from a single case to all of the cases, and it wouldn't

17

make sense to do that.

18

We

I think Justice Scalia made the point in

19

this discussion that there just wouldn't be any marginal

20

deterrence if an inmate could file as many lawsuits as

21

he wanted and not make any additional ­­

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

What about the word "fees"?

24
25

MS. SAHARSKY:

You say the word "fees."
Does that show?
Right.

What petitioner says

is that the word "fees," plural, always means more than

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

one case.

2

that that's not true, because there are several places

3

where Congress says "fees" and it's referring to a

4

single case.

5

And we know from the text of this statute

So for example, in Subsection (b)(3),

6

Congress talks about the amount of fees permitted by

7

statute for a civil action or an appeal.

8

talks about any court fees required by law for an action

9

or appeal.

In (b)(1) it

Similarly, in (a)(1) and (a)(2) it talks

10

about fees, plural, for a ­­ a single action or a single

11

appeal.

12

And to be clear, we think that in this

13

statute Congress used "fee" and "fees" somewhat

14

interchangeably in the way that people do out in the

15

world; that people would say "attorney's fees," "an

16

attorney fee award," "fee shifting," "we're shifting all

17

the fees," that sort of thing, that that's just common

18

usage, and that the single/plural fees in

19

Subsection (b)(2) just does not provide the kind of

20

strong indication that would be necessary to overcome

21

the real thrust of the rest of the statute, which is

22

that it's something that a court does for each of these

23

cases.

24

the other things that are set out in the statute.

25

It sets out this payment plan; it does each of

whether it's ­­ well, I assume they didn't focus on

19

whether it's per case or per prisoner, because it's

20

really quite unclear.

21

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, we think that Congress

22

did make that decision when it wrote the ­­ the statute

from a perspective of a single case.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
about that.

Congress ­­

triggered from (b)(1), and it continues the per­case

25

focus that it's talking about, first we have an initial

payments to pay off the balance of that case.

3

And that's ­­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not sure that's

5

responsive to my point.

6

don't think it carries forward the case­by­case basis

7

because it speaks solely of what's required of the

8

prisoner in a way that doesn't address case by case at

9

all.

10
11

I guess what I was saying is I

I mean, that's why this is such a confusing

statute.
MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, we think ­­ the reason

12

that we think it does, just to be clear as possible, is

13

because of the language that starts Subsection (b)(2),

14

which is, "After payment of the initial partial filing

15

fee" ­­ which is for one case ­­ "then the prisoner is

16

required to make monthly payments," which is to pay the

17

remaining amount because we know he has to pay the full

18

amount for one case.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of 20 percent of the

20

preceding month's income.

21

think at least as reasonable as you're reading, to say

22

when you look at what is required of the prisoner, 20

23

percent of his income, that doesn't have anything to do

24

case by case, because what you would require, of course,

25

is that he pay 40 percent if there are two cases, or 60

To me, I ­­ well, I would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33

3

that may say, no, he's only supposed to pay 20 percent

4

of his income.

And I think he ­­ anyone ­­ someone looking at

5

MS. SAHARSKY:

But this ­­ this part of the

6

statute, and all the parts of this statute, really, are

7

talking about the perspective of a single case.

8

think the 20 percent makes sense in that regard, because

9

as one member of Congress said ­­ and this was quoted in

10

the D.C. Circuit's opinion ­­ the filing fee of ­­ of 20

11

percent is small enough not to deter a prisoner with a

12

meritorious claim, but it's large enough to deter

13

frivolous claims or multiple filings.

14

percent in every case right away.

16

MS. SAHARSKY:

17

payment, and it could be quite small.

18

different from having an ongoing monthly payment that

19

starts right away and that you have to pay.

20

Right.

But that's a one­time
And that's very

But I do want to address another ­­ another

21

point that I think your question raised, which is are

22

prisoners ever going to be paying these amounts,

23

particularly where they have filed numerous cases like

24

the individual in this case.

25

no, for two reasons.

And I think the answer is

The first is a practical one.

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

35
1
2

second one is a legal one.
I guess I'll start with the legal one that

3

numerous courts that have considered this issue have

4

said that once a prisoner is out in the world and is no

5

longer a prisoner but wants to continue his case, he can

6

try to qualify for regular IFP status and no longer have

7

to make his payments.

8

those payments.

17

So potentially, he's not making

And regardless of how you would decide
that legal ­­

You agree with that

interpretation?
MS. SAHARSKY:

It's not something that we've

taken a position on in this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Then I don't think

it's fair to rely on it.
MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, then I ­­ I do think

18

it's fair to rely on it in light of the fact that no one

19

is collecting ­­ no one is ­­ there's not any

20

centralized mechanism to collect now.

21

And that's really the second point that I

22

wanted to make, which is regardless of how you would

23

resolve that legal question, and actually the reason

24

that the administrative office has not, so far as we

25

know, taken a position on that, is because there are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

serious practical problems to collecting.

2

One of those problems ­­ when you ­­ when

3

you look at the statute, Subsection (b) allows you to

4

take money from the trust accounts, so it's fairly easy

5

to collect while the individual is in prison.

6

the person is out in the world, courts ­­ each

7

individual court trying to collect filing fees that

8

are ­­ that the inmates ­­ the former inmate's on the

9

hook for is quite a difficult thing.

10

But once

We have spoken with folks from the

11

administrative office who tell us that there is not now

12

any centralized system for trying to refer those

13

obligations for treasury, and I think you could imagine

14

how cumbersome that would be.

15

potentially paying five years down the road, or never

16

paying is any kind of marginal deterrent I think would

17

be wrong.

18

So to think that

We think that Congress knew that there were

19

multiple filers out there, and that if they were going

20

to file more lawsuits, they should pay more.

21

to be clear about what Congress was saying here, no one

22

is precluded from going to court.

23

saying is something very reasonable, which is if you

24

have funds available and you continue filing more

25

lawsuits and appeals, you should have to pay.

Alderson Reporting Company

And just

All Congress is

Ms. Saharsky, can I get back

4

to the $10 rule and the BOP policy with respect to this?

5

I think it was the Chief Justice who said that he didn't

6

really understand.

7

understanding about how the BOP is actually doing this,

8

given the language of the statute.

9

And I share his lack of

The statute says, you know, "shall forward

10

payments each time the amount in the account exceeds

11

$10."

12

an account with $10 and 1 cent, you make the next

13

payment.

14

not what the BOP is doing.

15

doing that?

So that suggests to me that if you're looking at

16

And I understand from your brief that that's

MS. SAHARSKY:

And how can the BOP be not

Well, a ­­ a couple of

17

answers.

18

you ­­ you cited can be read multiple ways, as I think

19

the discussion with Justice Breyer perhaps suggested,

20

that it could mean a $10 floor or it could mean that you

21

start making payments at the $10 and then go below the

22

$10.

23

First of all, we think that that language that

The BOP has long­standing ­­ has taken the

24

position, long­standing position, that you have a $10

25

floor that is not in any kind of regulation or published

guidance.

2

that is basically for inmate trust accounts.

3

an electronic system for having money coming in and out

4

of the accounts.

5

there since that database was set up in 2001.

6

think the statute could be read both ways, and we think

7

it is more consistent with Congress's intention to leave

8

the $10 in ­­

9

The way that we do it is we have a database

And we have had that $10 floor in

It's just

Tell me how it can be

You're saying you can't

In ­­ in all cases, $10 will always remain
How can you read it that way?

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, because when it says

17

"exceeds $10," I think you could ­­ you could read it as

18

that it can't ­­ kind of the flip side, that you can't

19

go below the $10.

20

at the ­­

23

result?

24
25

Or you could say that you could start

Just read the language.

What ­­ what language produces that

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

We think that it

is ­­ when you say it exceeds $10 that that means that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39

you can't ­­ there's the flip side of it that you can't

2

go below $10.

3

But to be ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That doesn't follow.

If the account exceeds $10, you take 20 percent of

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, Justice Scalia ­­
That's what it says.
Right.

If ­­ if you ­­ we

think that it can read both ways, but this is ­­ if you

disagreed about that, we don't think that that issue

18

So there is a way of construing the language which is

consistent with the obvious purpose to me, which is to

20

leave this prisoner with at least $10.

21

You forward the payment each time the

MS. SAHARSKY:

And there we have it.

Well, that's what we think.

22

We think it can be read multiple ways.

24

ways.

25

have read it one way versus the other.

And so far as we

There are cases in the courts of appeals that

To be clear

40
1

though, these cases not ones that have gone through any

2

detailed statutory analysis, not even as much detail as

3

this Court's discussion at argument today, but have just

4

said in an offhand line either you can go below the $10

5

or can't.

6

They've kind of gone both ways on that.
And in terms of experience, we know from the

7

Second Circuit's case that's cited in the briefs,

8

Whitfield, that New York did not go below the $10.

9

asked counsel of record for the States.

I

The States

filed a brief on our side of this case, and ­­ and the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

there was ­­ that it went below the $10 in a ­­ in one

I ­­ you know, I don't know if it was.

23

He cites two cases.

One is ­­ they're from

One of the cases said that

But it didn't say that was the State policy.

And then the second was an individual

24

accounting clerk who had gone below the $10 and who had

25

done it manually.

So I don't know that that represents

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

any kind of policy either.

2

But if I could step back, I think it is not

3

necessary for this Court to resolve the $10 issue to

4

resolve the question presented, because the question is

5

should an inmate who files more cases have to make

6

monthly payments?

7

And just as ­­ and just parenthetically to

highlight why the Court doesn't need to resolve the $10

issue to resolve this case, this was not an issue that

it's not something that was in the certiorari petition.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Ms. Saharsky, I

find ­­ I ­­ I think others may too.

that's before us very difficult to resolve based on the

statutory language.

8

the rule of lenity in interpreting a criminal statute

I find the issue

Is there any doctrine tantamount to

most is the extreme harshness of your position.

Phone calls to family and friends, stamps for letters,

14

harsh.

ambiguity in the statute to save the last $10, but

you're unwilling to interpret what I think at least I

regard as the ambiguity in the statute to allow

22

prisoners ­­ I mean, they are prisoners.

23

that's perhaps not entitled to any grace, but who in

25

You're not willing

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, a couple of answers.

4

First of all, we think that this is not ­­ this ­­ this

5

question of a person having so little in their money ­­

6

money in their the account only arises in the case that

7

you're talking about someone who has filed five or more

8

lawsuits, which is not the ordinary case.

9

obviously a case to consider.

I mean, it is

But at least in the BOP's

10

experience, the vast majority of people who have orders

11

owed are for one lawsuit, two lawsuits.

12

court of appeals' cases below are like that, et cetera.

13

Most of the

Putting that to the side, of course, this

14

statute never prevents a prisoner from bringing a

15

meritorious case because of the safety­valve provision.

16

We also interpret the $10 amount to leave money in the

17

account.

18

There's also, of course, administrative

19

remedies, which administrative exhaustion is required.

20

So that helps resolve any questions about making sure

21

that claims are heard.

22

the discretion to allow phone calls, et cetera, to

23

indigent prisoner, also stamps, et cetera, et cetera.

24
25

And, in fact, the BOP does have

So in terms of what you potentially perceive
as harshness, this only arises in cases where an inmate

Official

44
1

is filing so many cases, that potentially a large

2

portion of his income used to pay filing fees.

3

really that's ­­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Just a thought.

5

Well, if you're there for 20 years, maybe you should let

6

them buy a book.

7

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

And this ­­ again,

8

this situation there ­­ I think most prisons actually

9

have libraries that books are available.

10

Court has had some cases about what libraries ­­

11
12

And like the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sure they are ­­

I'm sure they are very good libraries, too.

13

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, just ­­ just to be

14

clear, you know, this is a situation that only arises in

15

the fairly atypical situation.

16

statute does not specifically address the ­­ the

17

situation of a prisoner with five lawsuits or six

18

lawsuits and orders et cetera.

19

that that is and that the Seventh Circuit suggested in

20

one of the early opinions after PLRA was enacted is

21

because Congress thought that the three ­­ three­strikes

22

provision was going to prevent all of these lawsuits,

23

but it ­­

MS. SAHARSKY: ­­ the experience that we have

I can't say, you know ­­
I don't think ­­

5

in this case, for example, might be good to highlight,

6

which is Pinson, the individual who has filed more than

7

a hundred cases ­­ gets regular deposits into his

8

account, had been using them to buy books and other

9

materials.

Those are in the Joint Appendix starting on

10

pages 55, 56, et cetera.

11

able to ­­ even Pinson who has filed over a hundred

12

cases is able to ­­ to pay those amounts.

13

So it shows that prisoners are

And just to ­­ just to clarify, I think the

14

Court is thinking of a situation of, you know, a

15

prisoner who has 10 cents of income or $10 of income.

16

But we don't think that that is the typical situation.

17

Pinson's account at the time he filed shows that he

18

received an average of ­­ I think it was $48 a month of

19

income.

20

because I was curious about what is the median income

21

that's received, what is the median deposit.

22

that for the ­­ the past fiscal year, the median ­­

23

median income an inmate receives is approximately $120 a

24

month.

25

percent that he's paying towards filing fees, he could

I have asked the BOP for statistics just

They said

So, in fact, with that, if an inmate has 20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46

pay them off at a reasonable rate.

2

that's just really a much better alternative from what

3

Congress intended.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And we think that

But that does raise ­­ I

5

mean, as Mr. Shelley says, using that exact $50 number.

6

If you have $50 and you have five lawsuits, the $50 is

7

gone, assuming that the BOP's policy is not uniform and

8

maybe is not statutorily authorized.

9

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes, I think that ­­ I think

10

that that is the implication of it, and we think that

11

that is what Congress intended.

12

I am not sure if the Court is interested in

13

such information, but we actually did go ahead and just

14

look in our database to see how many inmates have one

15

PLRA order that they're paying as opposed to five orders

16

that we're paying.

17

last week, was that inmates ­­ there are 944 inmates of

18

the over 200,000 in the federal system who are paying on

19

one order, and only 60 inmates of the over 200,000 who

20

are paying on five or more orders or who had six, and

21

then 42 inmates who have six or more orders.

22

And what we found, just checking

So this actually is a ­­ a very small

23

problem, at least federally, and we would not want this

24

very small tail to wag the dog of this statute that is

25

clearly ­­ clearly intended by Congress to make sure

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47

that inmates who are filing frivolous lawsuits have a

2

financial disincentive to do so.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And ­­
Be clear about your

policy.

the 20 percent has to be paid on all five cases whether

There comes a point at which, if

the specific text of this provision, which is

Subsection (b) about filing fees but really the entire

statute written from the perspective of a single case, a

5

checklist for a single case, that Congress wanted

6

inmates who were filing more lawsuits to pay more.

7

And we think that that makes sense and that

8

also ­­ and I want ­­ this is, I think, a partial answer

9

to one of the prior questions of the Chief Justice in

10

terms of interpretative canons, etc., that it's

11

consistent with what this Court did last term in the

12

Coleman case.

13

In the Coleman case the Court was

14

considering the three­strikes provision, but it

15

recognized that that provision is written from the

16

perspective of a single case, a single action, or

appeal.

18

could get a strike for the appeal.

You could get a strike for the action.

And the same thing we think is true for the

action.

22

And we think that that makes complete sense.

23

You

First of all, with respect to the ­­ the

hypothetical that Justice Sotomayor asked, in fact, I

8

think if the account had $11 in it, the government's
