ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The Secretary of Homeland Security has

12

decided to defer removal of the class of aliens who are

13

parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs, have lived in the

14

country continuously since 2010, and not committed

15

crimes.

16

it is lawful.

17

reality that DHS has resources only to remove a fraction

18

of the unlawful aliens, the aliens presently ­­ present

19

unlawfully in the country now.

That policy is lawful and Respondents concede
It is fully justified by the fundamental

20

This class of aliens is the lowest priority.

21

And there is a pressing humanitarian concern in avoiding

22

the breakup of families that contain U.S. citizen

23

children.

24

The principal ­­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Couldn't the government

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

simply, as was suggested in one of the briefs, have

2

given these children ­­ parents of citizens or LPRs,

3

given them identity cards that say "low priority," and

4

would there be any difference between that and what this

5

DAPA Guidance does?

6

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That is ­­ that's a very

7

important point, Justice Ginsburg.

That ­­ that is

8

precisely what deferred action is.

Deferred action is a

9

decision that you were ­­ that you are a low priority

10

for removal, and it's an official notification to you of

11

that decision.

12

have the lawful authority to do both things:

13

that judgment and to give an identification card.

14

And Respondents have conceded that we

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To make

General, maybe it

15

would make logical progression if you began with your

16

standing argument first.

17
18
19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

And I think this

does lead right into the standing argument.
I think the principal bone of contention

20

between the ­­ the Respondents and the United States is

21

over whether the Secretary can also authorize these

22

people to work and accrue ancillary benefits, and

23

Respondents lack standing to challenge that for three

24

fundamental reasons.

25

First, there's ­­ the injury is not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

5
1

redressable, because even if they achieve the ­­ even if

2

they achieve the injunction that they want, barring us

3

from providing work authorization ancillary benefits, we

4

can, for the reason Justice Ginsburg identified, still

5

provide them with deferred action.

6

they still qualify for a license under deferred action,

7

so there's no redressability.

8
9

And under Texas law,

Second, they have not alleged a concrete
particularized injury because the costs that they claim

10

now to be an injury are actually the expected and

11

desired result of the policy that exists in current

12

Texas law ­­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but if ­­ if

14

they change that policy to avoid the injury that they

15

allege, in other words, if they did not confer ­­ offer

16

driver's licenses to those who are lawfully present

17

because of your policy, avoided that injury, you would

18

sue them, wouldn't you?

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

20

we would sue them.

21

But the fundamental ­­

22

I'm not sure at all that

It would depend on what they did.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

What they

23

did ­­ I'm hypothesizing ­­ is that they offered

24

driver's license to everyone, but not those who were

25

here under your ­­ under DAPA, under your proposal.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

word in your question is "hypothesize."

4

in their law.

5

And that's the

They have not made that change

What they ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, because they

6

have what seems to me a perfectly legitimate policy, is

7

they want driver's license to be available to people who

8

are lawfully present here.

9

government, say, well, these people are lawfully

And if you, the Federal

10

present, that means they have to give a driver's license

11

to however many of them, more than half a million

12

people, who would be potentially eligible for them.

13
14
15

And as I understand from your brief, your
answer is, well, just don't give them driver's licenses.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

The current policy is not

16

as Your Honor describes it.

17

reflected in the existing law and regulation is quite

18

different, and that's the point.

19

driver's license now to any category of person who has a

document from the Federal government, not only saying

21

you're lawfully present, but that you're officially ­­

The current policy

There are vast numbers of people under

that there is some way that they could achieve that,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You look to their law

General, when you say

10

that, I'm looking at their law.

11

they will give licenses to persons granted deferred

12

action on the basis of immigration documentation

13

received with an alien number and from the government.

14

And their law says that

So that's what ­­ you're saying they've

15

already made the determination that they'll give

16

licenses to people with deferred action.

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

18

That's one thing I'm saying that's quite important, but

19

it even goes beyond that.

20

They're ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, but they want to

21

do that.

22

saying if you're lawfully present, you ought to have a

23

driver's license?

24
25

Is there anything wrong with their policy

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, but I guess, Mr.

Chief Justice, what I'm trying to get across is that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

9
1

policy, as it's written down and which, it seems to me,

2

has to be taken as the authoritative statement of the

3

Texas policy, is not just that they want to give

4

licenses to people who are lawfully present.

5

licenses to all ­­ to numerous categories of people who,

6

under the substantive theory of law that they are

7

advancing now, would not be eligible ­­

8

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

They give

So what your

argument is then, they should take these people out of
eligibility, too.

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

My argument ­­
Their argument is,

13

we're going to give driver's license to people subject

14

to deferred action.

15

your injury?

16

And you're saying, okay, that's

You can take that away.
And I just think that's a real catch­22.

17

If ­­ if you're injured, you have standing.

18

not injured because you can change your policy and not

19

give driver's license to these people.

20

But you're

And I suggest that ­­ I think you would

21

want ­­ you would sue them instantly if they said,

22

people here lawfully present under the Federal authority

23

are being discriminated against.

24

argument the government makes on a regular basis.

25

if you don't, the intervenors will sue them.

It's a preemption

Alderson Reporting Company

And

They've

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

10

2

already said that they think that's illegal.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

The fundamental problem,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, is ­­ with that theory ­­ is that it

4

requires this Court essentially to issue an advisory

5

opinion about whether this new law of theirs would, in

6

fact, be preempted.

7

preempted, but it's up to the judiciary ultimately to

8

decide whether it's preempted.

9

injury to occur, they ­­ the law ­­ the judiciary would

10
11

After all, we might think it's

So in order for that

have to decide it's preempted.

And the normal way ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you're saying

12

they would not have injury because they can do this, and

13

you might lose the suit.

14
15
16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's correct.

It's ­­

it's hypothetical at this point.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, General, I don't

17

understand why you wouldn't lose the suit.

18

Section 1621 says, "States aren't required to give State

19

benefits to nonqualified aliens, including deferred

20

action recipients."

21
22
23

I mean,

I guess I don't really understand what the
basis of a preemption suit would be given that section.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Justice Kagan, I'd like

24

to be able to agree with you about that.

25

1621 actually applies to driver's licenses.

Alderson Reporting Company

We don't think
And it ­­

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

11
1

depending on what they did, we might or might not think

2

the law is preempted.

3

step, which would be a significant change from Texas law

4

as it now exists, they really are asking you for an

5

advisory opinion about whether the thing they want to do

6

would be preempted.

7

But until they actually take that

I mean, if you think about it ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

You're saying they have

8

inflicted this injury on themselves because they have

9

options.

And one of the options, and I assume the one

10

that they would like to pursue, is to deny driver's

11

licenses to the beneficiaries of DAPA.

12

going to make the argument that they lack standing

13

because they have a viable legal option, I think you

14

have to tell us whether, in the view of the United

15

States, it would be lawful for them to do that.

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if you're

So, it would ­­

I think the Chief Justice

18

asked you that question before, and you didn't get a

19

chance to answer it.

Maybe you could answer it now.

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It would depend on what

21

they did and why they did it.

But it does seem to me,

22

it's fundamental that they have to do it.

about it this way ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, think

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

You'll have to wait down

7

said, we're going to give licenses to everybody we're

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But there's Article III

GENERAL VERRILLI:

For

I want

And I think that gets to

the point ­­ that gets to the point, Justice Kennedy.

15

If right now, tomorrow, today instead of suing us they

had come into court and said we want a declaratory

17

judgment, we are thinking about ­­ in light of this

18

change in Federal law, we're thinking about changing our

19

State law to a different law, and we want a declaratory

20

judgment that if we do so, it won't be preempted, I

21

think you would throw that case out in a nanosecond as

hypothetical, and that is this case.

That is precisely the situation we are in

right now.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. General, in the

17

to what the ­­ its law says right at this moment that

18

that license would sue the State, correct?

The State could then defend that action,

Alderson Reporting Company

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Of course.
And it could raise

correct?

said in Raines v. Byrd.

16

is an important issue that is ­­ is teed up in front of

you, and it is an important issue.

18

point is that the legitimacy of the citing issues of

here yet ­­

have standing to say that?

21

GENERAL VERRILLI:

The second is wrong
Do they

The ­­ I have to ­­ I

22

have to caveat my answer, because I think if the second

23

law is an immigration law that says we're going to make

an immigration policy judgment that's going to result in

25

additional people being in the State, then I don't think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

17

they would have standing.

2

But the fundamental point, I think, of

3

importance here is that the premise that the first ­­ of

4

the first law that they are required to give driver's

5

licences is not present here.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I have no doubt it isn't

7

present here.

is I'm supposed to say if I agree with you.

9

I asked the question to clarify what it

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And I tried to answer

10

that and tell you why I think the premise is different.

11

I did try to answer you and then tell you why I think

12

the premise is different.

13

But I ­­ but I do think ­­ and I think this

14

is ­­ you know, there's a sort of a

15

shoe­on­the­other­foot issue here.

16

that a State can sue the Federal government based on

17

these kinds of indirect and incidental effects, then it

18

seems to me you'd have to also say that if a State

19

decided, for example, that it wasn't going to enforce

20

its minimum wage law anymore, and as a result, the

21

Federal government had to increase its enforcement costs

22

for Federal minimum wage laws in that State, that the

23

Federal government would then have standing to go into

10

were ­­ there are two fundamental differences, at least

11

two fundamental differences.

12

One is what the Court said is that under

13

the ­­ under the Clean Air Act, that Congress had

14

charged the EPA with protecting States and others from

15

the effects of air pollution and then given a specific

16

cause of action to the people whose protection EPA was

17

charged with to sue if EPA wasn't doing its job.

18

that ­­ and I think this is at page 520 of the

19

opinion ­­ the Court said was indispensable, was

20

critical to the finding that States got special

21

solicitude and were allowed to sue in a manner where,

22

under Article III, they normally wouldn't be able to

23

sue.

24
25

And

In addition ­­ and in addition, I do think
that you do have a quite different situation in that

there was no way for Massachusetts to avoid the effects

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Maybe I could ask

I was just going to ask

Thank you.

So I think it's important, again, to frame
where we are on the merits here, that the ­­ their ­­

10

Texas agrees that the ­­ that DHS has the authority to

11

defer removal of this class of alien parents of U.S.

They agree that that judgment is

What we disagree about is whether ­­

15

principally, whether we also have the authority to

16

authorize them to work and to accrue some ancillary

17

benefits based on that work.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Before you get to

19

that, could I ask you a question about the scope of your

20

argument?

21

GENERAL VERRILLI:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sure.
Under your argument,

23

could the President grant deferred removal to every

24

unlawful ­­ unlawfully present alien in the United

25

States right now?

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Definitely not.
Why not?

Here are the limits.

4

Because the deferred action has ­­ over time, there have

5

been built up a set of administrative limits, which I'll

6

talk about, some administrative policy limits, and then

7

there's substantive statutory limits.

8
9
10

The administrative policy limits are these:
Deferred action has always been for the lowest
priorities for removal.

11
12

And everybody agrees ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

By

"administrative," you mean by the Executive branch?

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct.

Yes.

But ­­

So that somehow

15

binds the Executive branch now, the fact that ­­ I mean,

16

this hasn't been approved by the Executive branch prior

17

to this point, either, and yet it's a fairly significant

18

departure.

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Let me ­­ let me ­­ I

20

don't ­­ I wouldn't agree with that premise, Mr. Chief

21

Justice, but let me walk through it.

22

So it's ­­ you've got to be the lowest

23

priority.

24

back decades that talk about work authorization related

25

to people at deferred action say that there's got to be

It's ­­ there are ­­ the regulations going

they've got to be lowest priority; it's got to be

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

that the Executive has set for itself now.

so ­­ so the categories you say would have to be

excluded are criminals, people detained at the border,

the right policy, so we're just not going to remove

25

I think it's different, and it's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Verrilli, how

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

25
1

much ­­ please, how much of a factor is the reality that

2

we have 11.3 million undocumented aliens in the country,

3

and Congress, the Legislature, has provided funds for

removing about four million.

5

have to be set.

So inevitably, priorities

6

GENERAL VERRILLI:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

Exactly.

You started out

8

telling us that the enforcement priorities were not at

issue; that ­­ that the problem was the benefits that

10

flow from that, the work authorization, the earned

11

income tax credit, the Social Security benefits, the

12

Medicare benefits.

13

So as I understand it ­­ and I think this is

14

the point you made ­­ the other side is not disputing

15

the fact that you have authority to exercise discretion.

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Correct.

And that, I

17

think is the answer to ­­ that I was going to give to

18

your question, Justice Kennedy.

19

with respect to this ­­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it seems to me,

Mr. General, before you

21

go on, I ­­ just to make sure we have ­­ we're on the

22

same page, you only deport 400,000, not four million.

23
24
25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It's not four million.

Forgive me.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So we have ­­

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:
resources for about 400,000.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

­­ yes.

We have

Right.
So we have ­­ we have

4

basically 10 million, nine hundred thousand people that

5

cannot be deported because there's not enough resources,

6

correct?

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

That's correct.
So they are here whether

we want them or not.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

And the key point is that

11

we have always had a policy that says when you have ­­

12

when your presence is going to be officially tolerated,

13

you're not here, you're violating the immigration laws

14

by being here.

15

presence is going to be officially tolerated.

16

you're in that circumstance, we allow you to work

17

because it makes sense to allow you to work.

18

otherwise ­­ you're going to be here, and otherwise, if

19

you can't work lawfully, you're going to either not be

20

able to support yourself and be forced into the

You don't have any rights, but your
When

On page 16, you

And less

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

27

than a page later, you say, "Aliens with deferred action

are present in violation of the law."

3

Now, that must have been a hard sentence to

4

write.

5

yet, they're present in violation of the law.

6
7

I mean, they're ­­ they're lawfully present, and

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I actually had no trouble

writing it, Mr. Chief Justice.

8

(Laughter.)

9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

The reason I had no

10

problem writing it is because that phrase, "lawful

11

presence," has caused a terrible amount of confusion in

12

this case; I realize it.

13

it means something different to people in the

14

immigration world.

15

But the reality is it means ­­

What it means in the immigration world is

16

not that you have a legal right to be in the United

States, that your status has changed in any way.

18

you have any defense to removal.

19

those things, and it never has.

doesn't ­­ and so at that fundamental level, we are not

either to say that they're lawfully present in the

about?

what DAPA does, which is provide tolerated presence and

actually going to give these people lawful permanent

further.

10
11

One is what DACA does is

If he had said, I'm

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And ­­ and well, but ­­

but as I said, I ­­ you know, I really think that ­­
And then ­­ and then second, the other thing

15

is, you know, maybe he thought he couldn't extend it at

16

that time to DAPA.

17

that the President and the Secretary went to the Office

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

14
15

MR. SAENZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

16

The Jane Does, three Texas mothers of U.S.

17

citizen children, seek the opportunity to apply for

18

discretionary, temporary and revocable relief from the

19

daily fear that they will be separated from their

20

families and detained or removed from their homes under

21

the current nonuniform and frequently arbitrary Federal

22

immigration enforcement system, which fails to provide

23

any reliable opportunity to be identified as low

24

priority.

25

Their own State of Texas, through this suit,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

36
1

has blocked the Guidance that would secure the Jane Does

2

an opportunity to step forward, register and apply and

3

obtain a timely decision with respect to deferred

4

action.

5

speculative budgetary injury that contradicts the

6

State's own legislative decision, after balancing all

7

policy considerations to subsidize and encourage the

8

acquisition of driver's licenses with no annual or

9

cumulative limit on subsidies in that form.

Texas does so based on asserted indirect and

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you think it

11

would be illegal if Texas adopted a policy saying

12

everyone lawfully present in Texas except people subject

13

to DAPA get a driver's license?

14

MR. SAENZ:

I think it would be, in candor,

15

subject to a challenge that would revolve around the

16

circumstances and the reasoning behind that new

17

legislation.

18

Texas has not done that.

19

its legislative process would result in determining that

20

its previous decision that subsidized licenses make

21

sense without limit has some endpoint.

22

that you've described where it specifically targets one

23

set of deferred action recipients would certainly raise

24

questions.

That's correct, Your Honor.

this case, it would arise in the context of a change

22

which could raise equal protection concerns to be

23

resolved in the kind of concrete clash of interest that

this Court has indicated are behind Article III.

I think it's important to note that not only

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do I take it from the way

you are phrasing this that you actually think that the

4

equal protection concerns would be more serious than the

5

preemption concerns?

MR. SAENZ:

I think it depends on the

7

circumstances of how Texas is to make its decision.

8

the more reason to wait until it's actually made a

9

decision through a legislative process where there would

All

10

be a record of why the legislators chose to change from

11

a policy that currently provides licenses to anyone who

12

can demonstrate that they are authorized to be in the

13

United States, to something that would leave some folks

14

in that category out.

If they would decide that tolerated presence

record of why they made that decision.

14

Therefore, any concerns about work authorization would

State of Texas.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

In the Whiting case a few

18

terms ago, the Court upheld an Arizona statute that

19

imposed pretty severe civil penalties on an employer who

20

employed individuals who were not authorized to work.

21

So if an employer in Arizona hires DAPA beneficiaries

22

and the State attempts to impose those civil penalties

23

on that employer, I assume that you believe that DAPA

24

would provide a legal defense to that?

25

MR. SAENZ:

I believe there would be a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

44
1

defense, but before that, because the Whiting case

2

involved a requirement to use either by system under the

3

verified system, those who were work authorized, whether

4

through deferred action or otherwise, should come back

5

as authorized workers.

6

So I think the State of Arizona, which

7

premised its statute in part to receive this Court's

8

blessing of that statute on relying on Federal decision

9

makers, would not be in a position to engage in what

10

you've described.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, prior to DAPA, if the

12

employer had employed these individuals, the employer

13

would be subject to those penalties, would it not?

14

MR. SAENZ:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

16
17

That is correct.
And after DAPA, it would not

be.
MR. SAENZ:

Work authorization is an

18

authorization to work that is separate from the

19

deferred­action determination.

20

Texas has conceded the deferred­action determination and

21

seems to be focusing on work authorization.

22

work authorization has absolutely no relationship to the

23

alleged injury of driver's licenses.

25

MR. KELLER:

But what Congress did in 1986

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

47

with work authorization, and 1996 with benefits, is it

2

restricted work and benefits as an alternative mechanism

3

to enforce immigration law.

4

there are going to be people in the country that are

5

unlawfully present, and yet, Congress put forward those

6

barriers to work and to benefits precisely to deter

do here is flout that determination.

9

Those judgments acknowledge

What the Executive is trying to

Except that the ­­ the

work authorization ability of the Attorney General to do

13

still has not undone the 1986 regulation.

14

It may at some later point, but it

comprehensive framework for combatting the employment of

the past practice and enact a general Federal ban on the

18

employment of unauthorized aliens.

19

That was a decision to repudiate

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And ­­ and the

20

regulation permitting the Attorney General to give work

21

authorization to deferred­action individuals has stood

22

since that time.

23

MR. KELLER:

But when that regulation was

24

passed in 1987, the Executive said that the number

covered by that regulation was so small as, quote, "to

could do this case­by­case, one by one with respect to

tougher case, I do believe that they could do it class

originally.

removal, and there was not work authorization attached

to it, and there was not Social Security or any other

benefits attached to it, are you conceding that?

17

If they were simply forbearing from

In this case, given that they

are removing 400,000 people a year, we admit that they

could do forbearance from removal.

do is grant authorization to be in the country.

15

General Verrilli, of course, says you could strike that

16

phrase today if you wanted to; that that phrase really

17

has no legal consequence whatsoever; that all this

18

document does is do exactly what you said, which is to

19

grant forbearance, to tell people we are ­­ you are not

20

our enforcement priority, we are not going to deport you

21

until we say otherwise, which we can tomorrow too.

22

Is that what you're referring to?

MR. KELLER:

Because

That lawful presence phrase is

23

key because that's the first time in a deferred­action

24

program the Executive has taken that position.

25

if that phrase were struck, that would still not cure

And so what is going on here is a

The one I'm thinking of is

15

Frothingham v. Mellon, Massachusetts v. Mellon.

16

there, in those cases, the Federal government had given

something to some people.

Other people wanted to sue because they said that means

we're going to have to pay more money.

12

surely they cannot sue just by announcing it requires a

14

15

political disagreement where States disagree would come

16

before the Court.

17

MR. KELLER:

Well, but I think a lot of

18

those cases would be taken care of through causation

19

requirements, injury­in­fact requirements, and the zone

20

of interest test, for instance, the adjusted gross

21

income example and the veterans benefits example that

22

the other side has brought up.

23

cases would be screened out through the zone­of­interest

24

test.

25

I think that all those

Here, we put forward over a thousand pages

Alderson Reporting Company

of evidence into the preliminary injunction record with

2

over a dozen declarations and have factfindings

3

establishing exactly what Arizona v. United States said,

4

which is that the States bear the consequences of

5

illegal immigration.

6

And when we can come to court and show a

7

concrete injury and a policy that is causing that

8

injury, and by enjoying that policy, we wouldn't have to

9

incur either the financial harm or the sovereign harm,

10

that's precisely when ­­

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

MR. KELLER:

13

Well, but that ­­

­­ you have Article III

cases ­­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

­­ that really pits the

15

States against every Federal agency.

16

financial harm that indirectly flows from a change in

17

policy would be subject to attack.

18

And any harm,

Let me give you a prime example.

Okay?

19

Imagine Texas passed a law forbidding its State pension

20

plan from investing in any financial company whatsoever

21

that the Federal Stability Oversight Council declares

22

systematically important.

23

Too big to fail.

Texas reasonably doesn't want to invest

24

money in companies that if they fail are going to tank

25

the economy.

Now, let's say the Federal government sets

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

65
1

out a policy memorandum that says, in our discretion, we

2

are not going to declare some insurance firms under a

3

4

should.

We just don't think we

Okay?

5

Why can't the States sue that Federal agency

6

and say the law mandates that you tell us who's too big

7

to fail?

8
9

MR. KELLER:

I don't think States would be

protected by laws governing which banks are too big to

10

fail, but States absolutely are protected by immigration

11

laws saying who is lawfully present within our borders.

12

And I think ­­ so that would be ­­ we did that under the

13

zone of interest test.

14

So even if ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We already said in

Arizona v. Whiting that you can't tell the Federal

government who to say is legally or not legally present

here.

You don't have a right to set immigration policy.

MR. KELLER:

And that's precisely ­­
You're not in the zone

MR. KELLER:

Oh, we absolutely are, and

that's precisely why I am standing here.

MR. KELLER:

When we're talking about the

scope of the program as opposed to bridging lawful

8

status, the scope goes to, is this a question of deep

9

economic significance?

It also goes to when the 1987

10

work authorization was justified, the Executive was

11

telling everyone through the administrative process that

12

this was for a minuscule number of people, and it

13

wouldn't affect the labor market.

14

And this also brings to light that here, the

15

Executive didn't even use notice­and­comment in

16

promulgating this sweeping ­­ their theory is that they

17

can grant deferred action where there's not going to be

lawful status, that no court can review it, and they

that affirmative act of not just forbearing and making

You can't cross it out and

Whatever the Executive wants to label that,

under its own regulations, deferred­action status is

equated with lawful presence.

the DAPA memo, it's still part of the regulatory scheme

that says once we've taken this extra step, not just of

deferring the removal of you, but of putting you into

the Executive is doing that, we are far outside the

nothing about work authorization, nothing about Social

probably never get to you because Congress hasn't given

MS. MURPHY:

Well, we would not necessarily

concede that you could actually grant people cards that

say we're not going to enforce the law as to you.

that's all not at issue in this case, because what the

But

If all they wanted to do was say we're not

13

huge deal about this, in particular 8 C.F.R. 1.3, which

14

I think they cite seven or eight times.

15

I urge you to go to look at it.

I urge you

16

to, in fact, read the rulemaking order that went along

17

with it from ­­ from 1996.

18

what it says, that it applies to one thing and one thing

19

only.

20

under Section 1611(b).

21

we quoted this in our reply brief ­­ specifically says

22

that although we're counting deferred action as lawful

23

presence for the purpose of accruing Social Security

24

benefits for the reason that if you can work lawfully,

25

you ought to be able to accrue benefits.

What you'll ­­ you'll see

That's the accrual of Social Security benefits
And the rulemaking order ­­ and

Alderson Reporting Company

This does not

confer any lawful status under the immigration laws.

2

specifically says that.

3

And so we can argue about whether the

4

Executive has the authority to consider people with

5

deferred action as lawfully present in that narrow

6

sense.

7

that is the tail on the dog here.

We think we're right.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

Maybe they're right, but
That's not ­­

Well, if you ­­ if the

9

phrase "lawful presence" were stricken from the

10

Guidance, would you take the position that DAPA

11

beneficiaries are not lawfully present for purposes of

12

­­ under certain statutes that use that phrase for the

13

re­entry bar, for eligibility for Federal benefits?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It's ­­ the only Federal

benefit is Social Security.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, would you say they

were lawfully present for those two statutory purposes?

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No.

There are

19

regulations that say that they are, but we ­­ and we can

20

fight about that.

21

said, that is the tail on the dog.

22

But that doesn't ­­ but that ­­ as I

Now, if I could go to the merits.

23

Repeatedly, you've heard that the Family Fairness policy

24

flat wrong.

That's just

There's a D.C. Circuit case, and you can

Alderson Reporting Company

read Judge Silberman's opinion in that case that we cite

2

at page 49 in our brief which specifically describes it

3

as extra­statutory, which is what it was.

4

Now, the other key point, and I think this

5

is really important.

6

who can get work authorization is that either Congress

7

has to specifically say you get work authorization, or

8

Congress has to specifically authorize the Attorney

9

General, now DHS, to get ­­ to grant ­­ to decide

Their theory about the scope of

10

whether people in this particular category can get work

11

authorization.

12

Forget about deferred action.

There are

13

millions of people who get work authorization under

14

existing law now who ­­ who couldn't get it if ­­ if

15

that were the proper interpretation of the law.

16

millions of people are in proceedings for adjustments of
