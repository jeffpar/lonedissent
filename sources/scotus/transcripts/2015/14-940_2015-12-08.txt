CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next this morning in Case 14­940, Evenwel v. Abbott.
Mr. Consovoy.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. CONSOVOY
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. CONSOVOY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This appeal presents a fundamental question.

11

That question is whether the one­person, one­vote rule

12

affords eligible voters any reasonable protection.

13

submit that the answer must be yes under this Court's

14

decisions, and as a consequence, Appellants have stated

15

a claim under the the Equal Protection Clause.

16

We

The districts at issue here, District 1 and

17

District 4, have deviations as measured by eligible

18

voters approaching 50 percent under any metric of

19

eligible voters.

20

sustained vote dilution of that magnitude under a

21

one­person, one­vote case.

22

continuing to Wesberry, through Reynolds, and the

23

Court's many decisions since then, the issue has always

24

been vote dilution.

25

No decision of this Court has ever

Beginning with Gray,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the many times

Alderson Reporting Company

the Court has said that the ­­ the principle is equal

2

representation of the population?

3

for half a century, population ­­ that the population is

4

the ­­ the legitimate standard.

5

the contrary.

6

And we have had now,

We have never held to

So we have the States overwhelmingly for

7

half a century using population as shown in the census,

8

and now you're saying they can't do that anymore.

9
10

MR. CONSOVOY:

I can answer the question

in ­­ in three different ways.

11

First, with respect to the phrase "equal

12

representation for equal numbers of people."

13

sentence originated in Wesberry.

14

the sentence.

15

"Therefore, for us to hold that within the States

16

legislatures may draw the lines of congressional

17

districts in such a way as to give some voters a greater

18

voice in choosing a congressman than others would be

19

unconstitutional."

20

That

But that's only half

There's a dash, and it continues:

And in fact, in every time the Court uses

21

that phrase, which is the only one, I believe, my

22

friends rely on, it is either within the same sentence

23

or bracketed on one side or the other by protection of

24

voters.

25

Now, as to tradition, to ­­ actually, to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

word "population," we don't ­­ we ­­ we see that as

2

asking the question, not answering it.

3

that Reynolds used population without distinguishing.

4

Burns itself reserved on the question.

5

that Burns reserved on it.

6

Burns explains

Hadley confirms

And here we are today.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought ­­ I thought

7

Burns said it approved a deviation from population but

8

it took great pains to say, we're not saying you could

9

do that in every case.

Burns seems to be the only ­­

10

the only case that you have, and Burns involved this

11

really peculiar situation of Hawaii with a tremendous

12

military temporary population.

18

eligible voters.

19

It certainly did say that you do not have to use
That supports our

It certainly says that you can protect
That supports our position.

And ­­ and further back to Your Honor's

20

question about tradition, if tradition were the rule,

21

Baker would have come out the other way.

22

for centuries, geography was the basis.

23

said in Baker, as a matter of jurisdiction, and then in

24

Reynolds as a matter of ­­ of equal protection law, that

25

tradition doesn't trump the individual rights of a voter

to be protected.

2

And we don't have to guess about that

3

because we know from standing.

4

standing was predicated on the right of the voter.

5

In all of those cases,

It would be unusual if someone who couldn't

6

vote came to this Court and says ­­ said my one ­­ a

7

child, for instance ­­ my one­person, one­vote rights

8

have been violated.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem is that ­­

10

what you're forgetting is the dual interest.

11

voting interest, but there is also a representation

12

interest, and it's that which has led us to ­­ to accept

13

the total population base because States have to have

14

some discretion to figure out who should be having the

15

representational voice.

16

There is a

Burns made it very clear that we were

17

deferring to the State because it had a legitimate

18

reason for its need.

19

And ­­ but Burns was in the 1960s, when we

20

picked total population as a perfectly legitimate way

21

because there's a representational need at issue as

22

well.

13

if we have districts that are overpopulated with

14

non­voters, we will have diminishing access to our

representative.

16

That's how far from
It is that,

We don't deny that access is an interest,

Mr. Consovoy, of course it's

true that when we apportion House members, we use total

population as the metric.

4

raised by your position is why it would be the case that

5

the Constitution requires something with respect to one

MR. CONSOVOY:

And the question that's

Apportionment and intrastate

congressional districting, as late as 1969, in

case, that Missouri could district at the congressional

level on the basis of eligible voters.

15

it would be fair to say that this issue has somehow been

16

clouded or decided by uses of the words "population" or

17

using the census in prior cases.

the beginning of the game, we shouldn't make the right

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER

19

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

20
21
22

MR. KELLER:

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The only question the Court has to resolve

23

here is whether the Equal Protection Clause requires

24

every State to change its current practice and use voter

25

population to reapportion.

The answer is no.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

Texas validly used Federal census data to

2

equalize total populations States have done for decades.

3

And the framers of the Equal Protection Clause accepted

4

total population as a permissible apportionment base in

5

Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, as Justice Kagan

6

said earlier.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why don't they

use that under Section 2, then?
MR. KELLER:

In Section 2 of ­­

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. KELLER:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. KELLER:

The Voting Rights.

The Voting Rights Act?
Yes.

Section 2 of the Voting Rights

14

Act for tax voters ­­ and our position, unlike the

15

United States's position, is that only voters are

16

protected under the Voting Rights Act.

17

considering whether there is an opportunity to elect a

18

candidate of one's choice, only voters would count for

19

that inquiry.

20

Indeed I ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

called the one­person, one­vote.

22

designed to protect voters.

23

So in

MR. KELLER:

Well, it is ­­ it is
That seems to be

It does protect voters, but

24

there are multiple legitimate bases here on which a

25

State can redistrict.

Electoral equality is one of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

them.

Representational equality is another.

2

And if I can back out, what we're dealing

3

with here is the general Equal Protection Clause's test

4

which ­­ it guards against invidious discrimination.

5

The Court has noted before a mere disparate impact does

6

not violate the Constitution.

7

that's being alleged here is one of invidious vote

8

dilution.

9

And so really the claim

But Texas, by using total population, as

10

States have done for decades, and no State today uses

11

voter population, did not invidiously target groups to

12

cancel out their voting power or reduce their ability to

13

elect representatives of their choice.

14

Rather, what Texas was doing was making the

15

legitimate choice to use representational equality,

16

which, as this Court's cases have noted, is a legitimate

17

interest that the State can account for in

18

redistricting.

19

What the State cannot do is submerge the

20

population principle.

21

we cannot base apportionment on geography.

22

take account of population.

23

In other words, as Reynolds held,
We have to

And we have done that.

There is no allegation here that our

24

8.04 percent deviation of total population would not

25

satisfy the Court's one­person, one­vote doctrine unless

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

we are required to use voter population.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

There are at least two

3

arguments that could support your position.

4

it's one­person, one­vote, and what counts is giving

5

each person an equal chance of affecting the outcome of

6

the election.

7

enough proxy for eligible voters.

8

argument.

9
10
11

One is that

But total population figures are a good
That's one possible

And that's ­­ that's what the census
measures, and that's close enough.
Another argument is that representational

12

equality is the real basis, and therefore that's why you

13

use population.

14

So which argument are you making?

15

MR. KELLER:

16
17

I don't believe we're making

either of those arguments, Justice Alito.
Total population is not permissible because

18

it tracks voter population.

19

Court doesn't have to reach this question,

20

representational equality is not the only basis on which

21

a State can redistrict.

22

At the same time, while the

It's our position that we could choose a

17

representation.

18

core sovereign function.

tension, that's not an illegitimate basis upon which to

reapportion.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if the voter

3

population is a permissible basis under the

4

Constitution, I assume that's because there is ­­ is an

5

ethical, a good government, a liberty interest in

6

protecting these voters.

7

correct?

That's a valid interest,

8

MR. KELLER:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Correct.
Well, if in a case like

10

this where there is a 45 percent deviation, something of

11

that order, then why isn't Texas required at that point

12

to recognize that these interests that are legitimate

13

under the Constitution, which are voter based, should

14

not be accommodated, and so that you should at least

15

give some consideration to this disparity that you have

16

among voters?

17

MR. KELLER:

Well, first off, the court in

18

Gaffney upheld the use of total population while

19

recognizing that there could ­­ there was, in New York

20

at least, a different State, a 29 percent deviation in

23

had not been made out.

24
25

Yet the court there said it was quite

And so while a State can, and legitimately
does consider both representational equality and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

electoral equality, the Equal Protection Clause's

2

general language doesn't mandate that either must take

3

precedence over the other.

4

So of course it would be legitimate for the

5

State to look at that data.

6

have Federal census data, which is the most robust data

7

set available, it is not invidious for Texas to use that

8

enumeration rather than a different data set when it

10

At the same time, when we

JUSTICE BREYER:

What we have ­­ and that's

12

why I think Justice Alito's question is important ­­ is

a table on page 9 of the Blue Brief.

14

Now, just looking at that table, by

15

inspection, I don't know whether the true ­­ whether

reaction.

10

MR. KELLER:

Sure.

So I'd like your

Justice Breyer, I

11

believe there's a difference between diminishing access

12

to representatives and actually having representation.

13

The United States has said that if Texas or another

14

State reapportioned on the basis of voter population,

15

that non­voters would be invisible to the system.

16

That's not right.

17

They would still be represented.

The issue is does State ­­ does a State have

21

MR. KELLER:

Well, first of all, there's

22

been no demonstrative plan that was submitted to the

23

Texas legislature, which has a notice­and­comment

24

procedure on this, or to the district court, that both

of these could have been equalized within 10 percent.

Alderson Reporting Company

Their demographer simply said, well,

If the Court were to try to go down the road

5

of requiring States to equalize within 10 percent of a

deviation, both total and voter population, States would

7

inevitably have to disregard many other traditional

redistricting factors, like compactness, continuity,

keeping communities together.

opposite of what the Court has said that States have in

Redistricting on the basis of total

2

population, as Texas did here, vindicates the principle

3

of equal representation for equal numbers of people that

4

is at the heart of Reynolds and Wesberry.

5

that Texas was not required to redistrict on the basis

6

of some as­yet­undefined measure of voter population.

7

We thus agree

However, we disagree that the Court should

8

go on to decide that Texas is free in the future to

9

redistrict on the basis of some measure of population ­­

10

voter population if it so chooses.

11
12

There are, in our view, at least four
reasons why voter population cannot be required.

13

First is the one mentioned by Justice Kagan.

14

We think it would be a very odd interpretation to say

15

that the Constitution forbids for State legislative

16

redistricting what it requires for congressional

17

redistricting.

18

Second is the very long history of States ­­

19

of States redistricting on a basis other than ­­ other

20

than voter population.

21

the Fourteenth Amendment, there were the vast majority

22

of states redistricted on other­than­voter population.

23

In the wake of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress in the

24

apportionment acts required districting on the basis of

25

inhabitants.

At the time of the framing of

Reynolds is also viewed, as we said on page 14 of our

Reynolds thought about it, was to say that, when you

22

Because we do think that the right at

The way to think about this, as Reynolds did,

That is exactly the point

And if I could pick up, then, on

7

Justice Kennedy's and the Chief Justice's point about

9

The reason is very much ­­ and we agree with

10

General Keller that the problem with doing both is that

11

it ­­ it largely eliminates a State's flexibility to

deal with the traditional redistricting factors.

you are forced to do is take a large, for example, Anglo

9

10

MR. GERSHENGORN:

­­ as to whether it would

11

have a large practical effect.

12

that is yes.

13

I think the answer to

What we're talking about is not just 50

14

States but thousands of jurisdictions around the

15

country, local jurisdictions, none of whom use voter

16

population as a measure for redistricting.

17

What the amicus briefs show is this is not

18

just a situation in which things are affected ­­ States

19

are affected where there are citizenship differences

20

between citizens and noncitizens, but that children

21

actually are a critical part of it.

22

Manhattan is 9 percent and Brooklyn is 30 percent

23

children.

24

briefs suggest, from 9 percent in some counties to 35

25

percent in other counties.

It's not just that

In Texas, the counties range, the amicus

In Alaska the difference

between rural and urban is 20 percent children in some

2

and 30 ­­ 37 percent in another.

This is an issue that is going to affect

4

States and local jurisdictions throughout the country.

5

And local jurisdictions, to be clear, don't have the

6

data at the level and ­­ at the level in which this

Court would now be requiring as a constitutional matter.

8
9

Now, I'd like to pick up on one other point
that Plaintiff's counsel raised, which is that, in his

10

view, it's quite unclear as to what Wesberry actually

11

holds.

12

misreading of Wesberry.

13

We think that that is really a fundamental

What Wesberry said was ­­ the whole point of

14

Wesberry was that the ­­ the method of apportioning or

15

allocating representatives to the States had to be the

16

same as the method for allocating within districts in a

17

18

said was that the great compromise had to be reflected

19

20

That was the reason that ­­ when what Wesberry

That principle in Wesberry was exactly the

principle that then the Court adopted in Reynolds,

11

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So Your Honor, I don't

12

think our argument is that voters are irrelevant.

13

first of all ­­ so a couple of points on that.

14

First, of course, the question here is, when

15

Texas has chosen to use total population, is that

16

permissible?

17

And

And we think that clearly is.
Second, we don't think voters are irrelevant

18

for the reasons that I've said.

19

did was ­­ and the Reynolds line of cases was to use

20

total population to vindicate the voters' right.

21

a voters' right ­­ because Reynolds understood that,
