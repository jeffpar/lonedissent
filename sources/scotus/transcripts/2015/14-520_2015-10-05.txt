ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. DUGGAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. DUGGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Persons who jointly and severally agree to

12

repay the applied­for debt are applicants under ECOA.

13

And that is precisely what occurred here.

14

were required, in violation of Regulation B in ECOA as

15

spousal guarantors, to become jointly and severally

16

liable to repay the debts of their husbands' business,

17

which clearly qualifies them as applicants both under

18

the straightforward language of ECOA, as well as the

19

Regulation B that was adopted by the regulators.

20

My clients

In this particular instance, as in many

21

credit transactions, the real applicants in this

22

transaction are not a to­be formed limited liability

23

company or corporation, but the persons that will stand

24

as guarantors behind that company.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Didn't the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

Reserve Board originally, I think, in 1977 take the

2

opposite position and said explicitly that applicant

3

excludes guarantors?

4

MR. DUGGAN:

Your Honor ­­ Your Honor, with

5

regard to that position that was taken by the FDIC in

6

1977, they were responding to claims by the industry

7

that they did not want applicants broadly defined to

8

include guarantors for notice provisions.

9

response to that, the regulation was crafted in a way

And in

10

that did, in fact, address that concern, but it was

11

never intended to eliminate the potential claims for

12

spousal guarantors.

13

When the case law came down and said we're

14

relying on the Regulation B of 1977, according to what

15

the regulators adopted then in 1985 they said, we were

16

mistaken.

17

intent was.

18

and make it clear that those persons who were

19

discriminated against based on marital status have the

20

right to bring the claim.

12

MR. DUGGAN:

Well, I think the Court has

13

already ruled in the Duke Energy case that regulators,

14

in appropriate circumstances, can even take a defined

15

term under the statute, in that case the term

16

"modification," and cause it to mean different things in

17

different subsections.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why didn't PHC Development

6

MR. DUGGAN:

At that point in time, the case

8

made it clear that the spouses had standing to bring the

9

claim, and the spouses were the ones that asserted the

10

claim.

Why does it matter, if

there's always somebody to bring a claim?

interpretation under their broad grant of authority that

the approval, that they have to come forward and be

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

Thank you, Counsel.

MR. FLETCHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

7

For 30 years, Regulation B has provided that

8

guarantors, cosigners, and other similar parties to

9

credit transactions, qualify as applicants, are entitled

10

to protection from discrimination under the Equal Credit

11

Opportunity Act and the Additional Parties rule.

12

longstanding regulation is reasonable, and it reflects a

13

reasonable interpretation of the Act's broad definition

14

of the term "applicant."

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That

Well, we've been

16

talking about applicants ­­ is it ­­ is the person an

17

2

is this person?

3

would say, no, it's a guarantor.

4

And if you ask somebody, well, what

Is this person an applicant?

MR. FLETCHER:

They

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the

5

term "guarantor" doesn't appear in the statute.

6

don't think it's true that the term "applicant" and

7

"guarantor" have fixed meanings in the industry and that

8

you could never construe a guarantor to be an applicant.

9

I think, in fact, often, as we explain in our brief,

And I

10

guarantors and cosigners might fill out the same

11

application and join together in the same application

12

that they submit to the borrower in seeking the loan.

13

And so I ­­ I don't think there's an industry

14

understanding that you can't reasonably regard a

15

guarantor or a cosigner or another secondary obligor

16

who's playing that sort of ­­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Wait.

Do you think

18

there's an industry understanding that there are

19

guarantors and there are applicants?

20

weren't in the industry and you're looking at this, you

21

wouldn't call the Petitioner an applicant.

22

her a guarantor.

23

MR. FLETCHER:

Wouldn't you

It said, "It shall be unlawful for any

10

respect to any aspect of a credit transaction."

11

then it defined an applicant to be any person who

applies to a creditor directly for an extension,

13

renewal, or continuation of credit.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

Would you disagree that in

15

ordinary speech, an applicant is understood, as

16

Judge Colloton said, to be someone who is asking for

17

something for himself or herself?

18

agree with that, could you give me your best example of

19

the situation in ordinary speech in which the term

20

"applicant" is used to refer to someone who is not

21

asking for something personally?

22

MR. FLETCHER:

Justice Alito, I agree that

very often, applicant refers to the person who's going

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Fletcher, in ­­ in some

20

ways, the Agency itself has admitted that this is not

21

the most natural reading of the term.

22

explained why it was articulating this rule, it said,

23

well, the problem is that Section 706 of the Act confers

24

standing to sue only upon an aggrieved applicant.

25

so we have to come in and kind of fix that.

Alderson Reporting Company

When the Agency

And

Official

18
1

And ­­ and so, too, the regulation itself

2

talks about applicants and additional parties as though

3

the two are different.

4

think Justice Scalia said, says, well, this ­­ this is

5

our definition of applicant, but it's really only for

6

this purpose, not throughout the statute.

7

those, it seems to me, are quasi­admissions that this is

8

not the most natural way to read the word "applicant."

9

And then the regulation, as I

MR. FLETCHER:

And all of

Justice Kagan, I'm glad you

10

brought that up because I very much disagree that that's

11

how the Agency has viewed this.

12

you referred to the way that the Agency described the

13

change it was making in 1985, when it amended the

14

regulation to expressly include guarantors for certain

15

purposes.

16

this because courts have ruled guarantors out of court.

17

But the reason that it said that was not that it

18

believed that guarantors were unambiguously excluded by

19

the statute or that it was rewriting the statute.

20

did that because between 1977 and 1985, the Agency's own

21

regulation had expressly said that applicants do not

22

include guarantors, cosigners, and other similar

23

parties.

24

guarantors didn't get to bring a suit were pointing to

25

the Agency's regulation and says this statute only

And you're right.

I think, in particular,

They said, we're doing

It

And so the courts that had said that

And so the Agency came in in 1985, and it

said, our own regulation, our previous version of our

MR. FLETCHER:

When the Agency ­­ and let me step

did you have to pass the first regulation at all?

Alderson Reporting Company

Why
What

caused you ­­ if it was as clear as Justice Scalia

2

believes, why did you need the regulation at all saying

3

it doesn't include?

4

MR. FLETCHER:

So if I could just give you a

5

little bit of the history of how the regulation

6

developed.

7

in 1974.

8

first passed regulations in 1975, it just incorporated

9

the statutory definition of applicant in relevant part.

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed
When the Agency, the Federal Reserve Board,

10

It didn't speak to the guarantor question one way or

11

another.

12

But in 1976, just a year later, it added a

13

substantive provision that made clear that at that time

14

in 1976, it regarded guarantors as applicants.

15

that for purposes of a provision of the

16

regulation ­­ and this is something we cite at Page 7 of

17

our brief ­­ for purposes of a provision of the

18

regulation, it required creditors to give notice of

19

their credit decisions to applicants.

20

multiple applicants, creditor, you can just give notice

21

to one of them.

22

may not give that notice to an applicant who is a

23

secondary obligor, such as a surety or a guarantor.

24
25

It said

If you have

But then the regulation provided you

So the Agency's first interpretation was
actually that the ­­ the plain language of the statute,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

which had been incorporated into the regulation,

2

included guarantors.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it correct that this

4

issue matters only where there are adverse ­­ where

5

the ­­ the borrower and the guarantor have adverse

6

interests?

7

arise?

8
9

And if that's correct, how often does that

MR. FLETCHER:

So Justice Alito, I think

it's particularly important where the borrower and the

10

guarantor have adverse interests for the ­­ for

11

instance, if there's been a divorce.

12

spouses' interests are no longer aligned.

13

it's very, very important.

14

only in those cases.

15

question that Justice Kagan raised earlier, which is why

16

does this matter?

17

And so the
Then I think

But I don't think it matters

And this goes to ­­ to the

And the reason that it matters is that a

18

guarantor who's improperly required to provide a

19

guaranty suffers a unique economic injury that is not

20

suffered by the applicant.

21

the lender says, I won't extend this loan without a

22

signature from your spouse.

23

that's a violation of Regulation B, and everyone agrees

24

that that's not permitted.

25

So in ­­ in a common case,

And everyone agrees that

And if, in that case, the spouse provides

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

the signature, as often happens, then the primary

2

applicant, the borrower, hasn't suffered any harm at

3

all.

4

have suffered discrimination in some sense, and they

5

would have a claim in some sense.

6

they're not going to have economic damages to assert in

7

court.

They've gotten the loan that they wanted.

8
9

So they

But in many cases,

The guarantor, on the other hand, oftentimes
will have that obligation on her credit report

10

immediately.

11

scores immediately.

12

there's a default on the underlying loan, then that's

13

going to be a black mark that's going to tarnish the

14

guarantor or the cosigner's credit going forward even if

15

she ultimately pays the debt.

16

It could adversely affect her credit
And as we explain in our brief, if

JUSTICE KAGAN:

One of the things that

17

Judge Posner said against your interpretation is that

18

this actually creates liability on a scale that Congress

19

wouldn't have expected because if you are right, the

20

guarantor can come in and ­­ and declare the entire loan

21

invalid, and ­­ and the damages would be much higher

22

than it is for the borrower himself.

23

what's ­­ what's the answer to that?

24

MR. FLETCHER:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean,

So I think ­­
Is there an answer?

Alderson Reporting Company

It's

Official

23
1

just like, well, that's what it is.

2

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I think the ­­ the

3

first answer is that that ­­ the availability of that

4

remedy of allowing a guarantor to assert and actually

5

invalidate the guaranty that's been illegally required,

6

that won't be resolved one way or the other by the way

7

you answered this question today, which is just are

8

guarantors reasonably regarded as applicants as they've

9

been defined for 30 years?

10

But ­­ but I understand, though, why you

11

would be interested because it is a related question of

12

what remedies might guarantors have available.

13

think the answer to Judge Posner's question in that case

14

is that there's nothing at all unreasonable about

15

requiring a lender that has improperly demanded a

16

guaranty to not be able to enjoy the benefit of that

17

guaranty.

18

that's been the enforcing agency's longstanding policy

19

when the FDIC or the Federal Reserve Board or other

20

agencies conduct examinations of the books of banks and

21

when they find violations of the additional party's rule

22

like this.

23

And we

As we explained at the end of our brief,

The remedy that they apply is to require the

24

bank to release the improper guaranty, or in cases ­­

25

and I think this is another important point ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

Regulation B doesn't prohibit spousal signatures under

2

all circumstances.

3

wants to do is ensure that in the event of a default,

4

it's going to be able to reach specific property that

5

the primary applicant is relying on, it can require a

6

signature from the spouse, not for personal liability,

7

but just to allow it to reach the property that is being

8

relied upon to support the loan.

To the extent that what the bank

In other words,

12

wouldn't work or would create a problem.

13

include guarantors, is it asked for comments on whether

15

there are specific provisions of the regulation that

16

guarantors should be exempted from.

17

those comments, it decided to exercise its broad

our brief, for purposes of the Fair Credit Reporting

5

Act, lenders and other banks rely every day on reading

6

the Fair Credit Reporting Act to mean that the same

7

definition of credit ­­ of credit, which refers to the

8

extension of credit, includes a guaranty.

connection with the transaction.

16

And we cite there a 2001 letter from all of

17

the banking regulators that explains in detail why it is

18

reasonable to regard guarantors and other secondary

contemplates that there can be situations in which a

it's a requirement that the spouse essentially become

debt in full and says, I have my independent obligations

under my guaranty, and if I don't perform, you can

collect the entire debt from me, how is that person in

that context not saying to the lender, I am appealing to

you and requesting an extension of credit?

21

far as to say I'll stand behind the loan, and I have my

independent obligations to perform under the guaranty.
