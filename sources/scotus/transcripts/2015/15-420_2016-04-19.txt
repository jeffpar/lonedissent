ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. PRELOGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress enacted Section 117 in response to

12

the epidemic of domestic violence in Indian Country.

13

The Ninth Circuit was wrong to strike down the statute

14

as applied to offenders like Respondent who have abused

15

and battered their intimate partners again and again,

16

but whose tribal­court misdemeanor convictions were

17

uncounseled and resulted in a sentence of imprisonment.

18

The Ninth Circuit's constitutional analysis

19

disconnects the validity of the underlying prior

20

conviction from the permissibility of relying on those

21

convictions to prove the defendant's recidivist status

22

if he commits additional criminal conduct.

23

runs counter to this Court's precedence.

24
25

And that

In Nichols v. United States, this Court held
that a conviction that was uncounseled but was valid at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

4
1

the time it was obtained remains valid when it's used in

2

a subsequent prosecution to classify the defendant as a

3

recidivist.

4

opinion, the rationale was that in the absence of an

5

actual Sixth Amendment violation in the underlying

6

proceeding, there's no proceeding in which the defendant

7

had but was denied a right to counsel.

8
9

As I understand the Court's logic in that

He didn't ­­ he has a right to counsel in
the subsequent Federal prosecution, and here, Respondent

10

had that right and it was respected.

11

represented by appointed counsel at every critical

12

stage.

13

counsel in the prior proceedings that resulted in that

14

conviction, then there's no defect, no constitutional

15

defect in those underlying convictions that can possibly

16

be carried over or exacerbated through reliance on those

17

convictions in the subsequent proceeding.

18

He was ­­ he was

But when a defendant doesn't have a right to

Now, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, and

19

Respondent's arguing here, that that might apply when

20

the conviction is ­­ is valid under the Court's

21

rationale in Scott.

22

that there's no right to appointed counsel in a

23

proceeding that doesn't result in imprisonment.

24

Respondent urges the Court to limit Nichols to that

25

situation, where you have a defendant who ­­ who wasn't

There, of course, the Court held

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

1

imprisoned in the prior proceeding.

2

But I don't think that makes sense as a

3

matter of the logic under this Court's decision in ­­ in

4

Nichols, nor do I think it makes sense as a matter of

5

practical reality.

6

Here, for example, Respondent says that if

7

only his Tribal Court had sentenced him to a fine rather

8

than to imprisonment, there would be no constitutional

9

infirmity with relying on those convictions in his

10

Section 117 prosecution.

11

But I can't fathom why it is that the Tribal

12

Court's sentencing determination would make any

13

difference with respect to the validity of those

14

convictions or the permissibility of using them to

15

identify the defendant as among those class of

16

individuals who are properly ­­

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose you had a

I don't think that there

22

would be any Sixth Amendment problem if Congress

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would there be a due

process problem?

MS. PRELOGAR:

I think it ­­ I think that it

would raise a more serious due process issue, but I

MS. PRELOGAR:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MS. PRELOGAR:

Why more serious ­­

Because ­­
­­ in England?

Well, I think that it would

8

be incumbent on a defendant in that situation to try to

9

come forward and make a showing that that foreign

10

conviction was obtained in a proceeding that wasn't

11

fundamentally fair.

12

fundamentally different, Justice Kennedy.

13
14

Tribal courts, I think, are

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could that showing be

attempted in a case like this?

15

MS. PRELOGAR:

In a Section 117 prosecution?

16

So that raises the question whether there should be a

17

right to have a collateral challenge to a particular

18

conviction.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I ­­ are foreign

20

judgments ­­ are foreign convictions ­­ I thought it had

21

to be a Federal, State or a tribal court.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm assuming the statute

was amended.
MS. PRELOGAR:

That's correct.

So ­­ so

just to clarify, it's true, Justice Ginsburg, that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

7
1

Section 117 doesn't cover foreign convictions.

2

understood Justice Kennedy to be asking whether there

3

would be a constitutional problem if it did.

4

And I

To the extent that this Court would perceive

5

the need to recognize an as­applied due­process

6

challenge to a foreign conviction, I think tribal

7

convictions are very differently situated.

8
9

And here's why.

Tribal convictions aren't

rendered wholly outside the auspices of our Federal

10

system or Federal review.

11

authority in this area, and it's acted.

Congress has plenary

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

rendered outside the Constitution.

14

MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, it's certainly

It's true that the

15

Constitution doesn't govern tribal court proceedings,

16

but Congress has plenary authority, and those

17

proceedings are governed by Federal law through the

18

Indian Civil Rights Act.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So this case would

20

come out differently if Congress had not enacted the

21

Indian Civil Rights Act?

22

MS. PRELOGAR:

I think that if Congress

23

hadn't enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act, it's

24

possible that it wouldn't have made tribal court

25

convictions predicates because it wouldn't have the same

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

8
1

confidence that there's a baseline level of procedural

2

fairness.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what if

4

they ­­ what if they had?

5

in a tribal court do count as predicates, and there is

6

no Indian Civil Rights Act.

7

In other words, convictions

MS. PRELOGAR:

In that circumstance, then I

8

think the inquiry would focus on what level of

9

procedural fairness is being applied in tribal courts in

10

the absence of that kind of Federal oversight.

11

think that that would also raise the question whether,

12

given the absence of Federal court review or ­­ or

13

Congress having enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act,

14

whether there should be a collateral challenge that's

15

permissible in that context.

16
17
18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I

So it would be a

case­by­case determination?
MS. PRELOGAR:

Yes, I think that in that

19

situation, there would be no grounds to say that the

20

Constitution categorically prohibits Congress from

21

defining the elements of the crime in that way.

22

think that it would be required for the defendant to try

23

to raise some kind of case­specific, individualized

24

objection to that kind of conviction.

25

So I

But just to be clear, Respondent is not

Alderson Reporting Company

attempting to make that kind of argument here.

2

Ninth Circuit's rule is a categorical rule that says

3

that all tribal­court convictions that are

uncounseled ­­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the

We already do that,

6

don't we, in the career armed felony statute because we

7

permit reliance on foreign convictions, correct?

8
9

MS. PRELOGAR:

I ­­ I'm not sure that the

ACCA permits reliance on foreign convictions.

I do know

10

that there are a number of Federal statutes that do.

11

The drug statutes, for example.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that we already put

13

in play the issue of whether an individual in a foreign

14

proceeding follows due process or not.

15

MS. PRELOGAR:

That's right.

I think this

17

statutes expressly permit the kind of collateral

18

challenge that I've been talking about with ­­

not raised in this case at all, right ­­

those convictions were obtained in compliance with the

And I don't

So I don't think that it's properly

11

presented here, and I'd urge the Court to reserve

12

judgment on that issue, which I think raises a number of

13

complexities, and wait for a case in which there has

14

been full briefing on them ­­

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If he hasn't raised it

16

here, are you suggesting by reserving it in this case,

17

that on remand, that issue could be aired?

18

MS. PRELOGAR:

I don't think that it would

19

be a live issue on remand, because Respondent has never

20

sought it at any stage of the proceedings to make this

21

kind of claim that there was any unfairness in his

22

tribal­court proceedings or that he was wrongfully

23

convicted in tribal court.

24
25

And I should emphasize, too, Justice
Ginsburg, that if he had that kind of claim, he had

alternative channels to raise it previously.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you tell me just as a

3

matter of practice, if you know, are these claims of ­­

4

of unfairness in individual tribes made often or in

5

recent years, in cases like this?

MS. PRELOGAR:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. PRELOGAR:

So ­­
I just don't know.

aware of any case in which someone has tried to make

this kind of as­applied due process challenge that we've

been discussing.

12

prosecution that presents that issue.

13

some other contexts where the Court has recognized a

14

limited right for collateral review, for example, under

15

the Mendoza­Lopez decision, I think that those claims

16

are more commonly made.

17

And so I don't know of any Section 117
Obviously, in

But ­­ but here I think that it's quite

18

clear that Respondent hasn't preserved that argument.

19

He doesn't want to press it.

20

anything wrong with his tribal­court convictions.

21

Rather, what he's arguing is that all of those

22

convictions should be categorically treated as though

23

they don't exist when you're determining whether the

24

defendant is a recidivist for purposes of prosecution

25

under this statute.

He doesn't think there was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought the

2

National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers had

3

discussion of a few prosecutions where those claims were

4

raised.

5

MS. PRELOGAR:

Yes.

So ­­ so those are

6

habeas cases, though, where the defendant, following the

7

channels that Congress prescribed to catch those kinds

8

of errors, sought Federal court review from the tribal

9

court judgments.

And I think that that actually shows

10

that the habeas remedy is a meaningful safety valve in

11

this context.

12

Obviously, I ­­ I think that the presumption

13

should be that tribal courts are applying ­­ complying

14

with the Indian Civil Rights Act, and I think that the

15

studies that have comprehensively looked at this bear

16

that out and show that there isn't any rampant

17

unfairness occurring in those criminal prosecutions.

18

But to the extent that a case slips through

19

the cracks, Congress said in 25 U.S.C. Section 1303 that

20

a defendant in that circumstance can come to federal

21

court and get his conviction overturned if he has a

22

valid claim.

23

When a defendant doesn't exercise that

24

channel of review and doesn't seek to in any way dispute

25

the validity of his tribal court convictions ­­

Well, but how would

that work in a case like this?

But then later on, the 117 prosecution comes
along.

Is he just sort of stuck with the prior

10

allegedly deficient prosecution because he didn't bring

11

every challenge he possibly could have at that time?

12

MS. PRELOGAR:

Yes, I think he is stuck with

13

the decision he made.

14

could have been made in the Nichols case.

15

defendant there, because it was just a misdemeanor

16

conviction and because he wasn't incarcerated, wouldn't

have had any reason to challenge that conviction.

additional criminal misconduct, and although that might

But I think, as this Court has recognized in a

mean that he's exposed to those more severe penalties,

11

that there's nothing unfair in that process.

12

well, there's nothing to suggest that those more severe

13

penalties are being imposed for the prior acts.

And as

14

Rather, the Court has reasoned in a long

15

line of precedents, that in those kind of recidivist

16

situations, the penalty is a hundred percent for the

most recent act of violence or for the most recent act

of crime.

problem with ­­ with permitting the defendant to be

20

classified as a recidivist.

21

And so there's ­­ there's no constitutional

And the Court also noted in Daniels that

23

unfair about the original proceedings but lacked the

24

incentives to challenge it, or for whatever reason

didn't seek review at that time, he knows those

principle in our criminal justice system that if you do

3

it again, you're going to be treated more harshly.

4

And it ­­ it's a basic

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't ­­ I ­­ I

5

saw that argument in ­­ in your brief, and I'm not sure

6

I'm quite ­­ well, I'm not sure I agree with it.

7

I mean, the ­­ the idea you're saying is

8

that, well, if there's three offenses and on the third

9

one, you get this much enhanced penalty, that that's

10

only for the third one.

11

imposed for the prior two.

12

It doesn't ­­ it's not being

I mean, I understand that, that you're

13

already been convicted and sentenced under the prior

14

two, but it seems to me as a practical matter it's fair

15

to say that the enhancement is based on those prior two.

16

You can't just ignore the prior two and say, no, no,

17

it's all just about this third offense.

18

MS. PRELOGAR:

That might be true as a

19

practical matter, but I think this Court has recognized

20

that as a legal matter and as a constitutional matter,

21

the sentence is imposed only for the latest offense.

22

And the Court made this particularly clear,

23

I think, in Nichols where it said that, although

24

obviously the defendant was exposed to additional

25

punishment based on the fact that he had the prior

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

16
1

conviction, still, the ­­ the penalty in the recidivist

2

prosecution was wholly attributable to the instant

3

offense and not to anything that came before it.

4

And ­­ and I think the contrary ruling would

5

call into question some of the Court's double jeopardy

6

context or ex post facto laws.

7

this Court's precedents that recognize that principle,

8

that the recidivist prosecution is solely for the most

9

recent act, but it's an aggravated act because the

There's a long line of

10

defendant falls within that category of offenders who

11

have done it before, who have that criminal history, and

12

should, therefore, be treated more harshly if they don't

13

learn from their prior misconduct and their prior

14

punishment.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Bryant makes ­­ makes a

16

distinction between a sentence enhancement on the one

17

hand and the case where the prior conviction counts as

18

an element of the current offense.

19

Would you address what that argument was?

20

MS. PRELOGAR:

Yes.

So I understand that

21

Respondent's making the claim that Nichols should be

22

limited to the sentencing context because it was a

23

sentencing case, and, of course, that case happened to

24

involve a sentencing enhancement.

25

that there's any logical difference between the use of

Alderson Reporting Company

But I don't think

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

17
1

the conviction when it's an enhancement in that way and

2

the use of the conviction when it's made an element of a

3

crime.

4

In either instance, the substantive purpose

5

of relying on that prior conviction is simply to

6

establish that the defendant has that criminal history

7

and that he's, therefore, properly classified as among

8

those offenders who should be treated as recidivists if

9

they commit additional misconduct.

10

And I don't think that the placement,

11

whether in a sentencing enhancement or ­­ or as an

12

element of a crime, should make any difference with

13

respect to the purpose to which that conviction is being

14

put.

15

Now, it's certainly the case the different

16

standards of review apply and that the conviction at the

17

sentencing enhancement needs to be proofed only by a

18

preponderance, whereas at the guilt stage it would have

19

to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

20

circumstances, it's the fact of the conviction that

21

matters.

MS. PRELOGAR:

That's correct.

I think

2

what's relevant, whether in the Nichols situation or

3

in ­­ under Section 117 is ­­ is that the defendant, in

4

fact, was previously committed of that domestic violence

5

offense.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Should there be

7

distinctions between prior, A, acts; B, convictions,

8

that in one case would result in a ­­ the commission of

9

a crime, and in another case, just enhance the sentence?

10

Should there ever be a distinction?

11

MS. PRELOGAR:

I can't think of one in the

12

context of ­­ of this kind of recidivist prosecution

13

that would require a distinction.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Nichols ­­

Could you use the

existence of a civil judgment for domestic assault to

any constitutional problem with that.

there are ­­

I don't think there would be

And, in fact,

And then you could

use a previous criminal ­­ a previous civil adjudication

22

for domestic assault as the basis for a Federal crime.

23

MS. PRELOGAR:

Yes, I think that's right.

24

And I don't think that anything in the Constitution

25

would prohibit that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's a very extensive ­­

that's a very extensive argument you're making.

MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, there are ­­ I think

problematic is because those civil adjudications are ­­

regularity and validity as any other valid adjudication

8

that's obtained.

They're entitled to the same presumption of

9

And in fact, a number of States have laws

10

that function somewhat like that in the drunk driving

11

context where the first infraction, the first drunk

12

driving incident is prosecuted as a civil offense, and

13

then a second drunk driving offense is treated as a

14

crime that requires proof of that civil adjudication.

15

And courts that have considered the constitutionality of

16

those schemes have reasoned that there's nothing

inherently problematic with giving effect to that civil

18

adjudication.

19

I think this reflects too that the States

20

and jurisdictions have broad leeway to structure their

21

recidivist statutes, whether they make them elements,

22

whether they make them sentencing factors.

23

is a ­­ a large problem, and the Court has recognized in

24

a variety of contexts that States have a lot of leeway

25

in choosing how to deal with that problem.

Alderson Reporting Company

Recidivism

But I don't

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

20
1

think that there's any inherent problem with the use

2

of ­­ of a valid conviction.

3

And again, just focusing back on the logic

4

of this Court's decision in Nichols, what the Court was

5

looking at there was whether there had been an actual

6

violation, because if you don't have a right­to­counsel

7

defect in that prior adjudication, whether it's civil,

8

whether it's ­­ it's criminal and uncounseled because

9

it's a misdemeanor that didn't result in imprisonment,

10

whatever the reason, the range of reasons why you might

11

be able to validly adjudicate guilt without the

12

assistance of counsel, there is simply no constitutional

13

infirmity in that conviction that would preclude its use

14

in a subsequent proceeding.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do we know why ­­ why

16

Congress, in the Indian Civil Rights Act, made the right

17

to counsel narrower than the right in the Sixth

18

Amendment?

19

MS. PRELOGAR:

I think that Congress, when

20

it enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act, after years of

21

studying this issue, was sensitive to balancing autonomy

22

for tribes and tribal sovereignty against individual

23

rights.

24

judgment that, given the other protections in the Indian

25

Civil Rights Act, tribal­court defendants could be

And I think that Congress must have made the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

21
1

fairly and reliably adjudicated guilty without the

2

assistance of counsel.

3

And that's actually something that's echoed

4

in this Court's precedents, because of course in Scott

5

and in Argersinger, this Court recognized that the

6

assistance of counsel under the Federal Constitution

7

isn't required in order to validly adjudicate the guilt

8

of a misdemeanor defendant.

9

In that circumstance, I think the Court ­­

10

what underlies that decision has to be a recognition

11

that there's something fundamentally different about

12

misdemeanor prosecutions, and that the assistance of

13

counsel isn't essential in that circumstance to validly

14

adjudicate a ­­ a defendant's guilt.

15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So ­­ so they knew

better than Madison?

17

MS. PRELOGAR:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well ­­
Madison ­­ the

19

drafters of the bill, they thought, well, maybe the

20

right to counsel was necessary here but Congress think

21

it's not that necessary.

22

MS. PRELOGAR:

But as I was just saying,

23

even under the Sixth Amendment, even where it applies it

24

doesn't preclude adjudicating the guilt of a defendant

25

in State or Federal court.

This Court's decision in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

22
1

Scott recognizes there's ­­ there's nothing wrong with

2

that.

3

And actually, I ­­ I think that the

4

on­the­ground practical realities bear out that

5

judgment, because even those defendants who aren't

6

indigent and aren't entitled to appointed counsel,

7

generally, in a large number of cases, decline to hire

8

counsel to represent them in misdemeanor cases, whereas

9

when you look at felony prosecutions, almost everybody

10

hires counsel if they're not entitled to appointed

11

counsel.

12

So I think that the nature of the proceeding

13

here really is critical in helping to understand why

14

Congress's judgment was rational, why the ­­ why the

15

Indian Civil Rights Act represents a reasonable baseline

16

level of ­­ of procedural fairness that's guaranteed to

17

tribal­court defendants, and why there's nothing wrong,

18

then, with giving effect to those tribal­court judgments

19

if the defendant fails to learn from his past behavior

20

and his past punishment.

21

These are offenders who have been repeatedly

22

punished by their tribal courts.

23

two prior convictions.

24

tribal courts, for the most part, are limited to

25

misdemeanor punishment, and that, for this class of

It requires at least

And the problem is, is that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

23

offenders, has proven to be an ineffective remedy; it

2

hasn't deterred the additional misconduct.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The tribal ­­ there was a

could order.

7

year?

8
9

I think it was ­­ wasn't it originally one

MS. PRELOGAR:

Originally, I believe it was

six months, and then it was lengthened to one year.

10

it was one year at the point that respondent was

11

convicted.

12
13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

One year, and now it's

three years?
MS. PRELOGAR:

That's correct, yes.

15

Actually, I think this is notable because I think it

16

shows that Congress, in recent years, every time it's

17

looked at how tribal courts are functioning and has made

18

a determination about the rights and ­­ and what to

19

recognize in those tribal­court proceedings, it's acted

20

to recognize expanded authority for tribal courts, both

21

with their sentencing authority, with respect to their

22

jurisdiction.

23

So I do think that that reflects legislative

24

judgment that tribal courts are sufficiently protective

25

of individual rights, and that there's no fundamental

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

24
1

unfairness that's occurring in those proceedings that

2

would cause, I think, this Court to question the

3

reliability of those determinations.

4

And I would point again to Respondent's

5

concession that if he had simply been fined in tribal

6

court and had not received a sentence of imprisonment,

7

then there would be no problem with giving effect to

8

those tribal­court convictions.

9

that Respondent's suggestion that there might be some

10

kind of a reliability concern with this conviction is

11

really unmoored from the constitutional analysis that

12

he's asking the Court to adopt in this case.

13
14

That shows, I think,

If there are no further questions, I'll
reserve the remainder of my time.

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN C. BABCOCK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BABCOCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The right to counsel is fundamental and

22

essential in our country, and that is something that

23

needs to be adhered to.

24
25

Using the tribal­court convictions in which
Mr. Bryant was not afforded counsel, then turning them

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

25
1

into an essential element of a 117(a) prosecution, runs

2

afoul what ­­ what this Court has stated is a

3

fundamental right for 53 years.

4

If we take a look at the cases that deal

5

with the Sixth Amendment analysis, from Johnson, to

6

Gideon, to Burgett, to Tucker, to Loper, reliability has

7

been the core concern of every single one of those

8

decisions.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you do ­­ disagree

10

with ­­ I think Ms. Prelogar said that you ­­ you

11

acknowledged that if the only sentence had been a fine,

12

no jail time, that these ­­ these two prior battery

13

misdemeanors, if the ­­ the tribal court gave only a

14

fine and no jail time, then those convictions could be

15

used under for a 117 prosecution.

16

MR. BABCOCK:

Correct.

And the reason that

17

we've stated that, and we don't believe that does

18

anything besides strengthen our argument in this case,

19

because the reason why there is no violation of the

20

Sixth Amendment is simply because the Sixth Amendment

21

doesn't exist.

22

or Federal court, the only court in the United States in

23

which it would not run afoul of the Sixth Amendment is

24

tribal court.

25

If this case would have been in a State

Mr. Bryant is not only a tribal member.

Alderson Reporting Company

He

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

26
1

of course is a United States citizen.

2

look at the Nichols case, which relied upon Scott, and

3

Scott specifically stated that they drew a bright line

4

with incarceration in dealing with the adjudication of

5

guilt, Mr. Bryant was incarcerated for his underlying

6

tribal­court convictions.

7

But in taking a

The defendant in Nichols, the uncounseled

8

DUI which he was convicted of, and the exact holding in

9

Nichols I think is extremely important in this case

10

where this Court stated that the Sixth and Fourteenth

11

Amendment are not violated when in fact there is an

12

adherence to Scott; in other words, there's no

13

incarceration, and they are valid to enhance punishment

14

in a subsequent proceeding.

15

So if we take a look at the individual in

16

Nichols, if he was incarcerated for the uncounseled

17

misdemeanor conviction, that case would not adhere to

18

Scott.

19

incarcerated, that violates Scott.

So it comes to reason, Mr. Bryant himself being

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm sorry.

I ­­ I ­­

My thought is this is

22

quite formalistic.

inherent reliability or unreliability.

24

were an uncounseled felony conviction, it might well

25

have been that the trial judge was much more careful

It doesn't have anything to do with

Alderson Reporting Company

In fact, if it

27

than he would be in a misdemeanor case.

2

opposite.

3

It's almost the

I ­­ I understand your ­­ the efficacy of

4

the clear line, but it's more formalistic than

5

functional, it does seem to me.

6

MR. BABCOCK:

Well, and I think it's the way

7

that we take a look at it ­­ and I think it's important

8

if we take a look at what Justice Scalia stated in the

9

Crawford case.

And that, of course, had to do with the

10

Confrontation Clause issue, but it specifically dealt

11

with the Sixth Amendment analysis based upon

12

reliability.

13

it's reliable, but how reliability is assessed.

14

His statement was it's not whether or not

The tribal court convictions in this case

15

were not subject to the crucible of meaningful

16

adversarial testing.

17

Justice Ginsburg stated in Shelton in 2002, that

18

element.

19

being used to establish guilt.

20

And that goes right back to what

And it is an element of the offense.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It is

But as Justice Ginsburg

21

pointed out, you could make the same argument if it had

22

been just a fine and no Sixth Amendment violation.

23
24
25

MR. BABCOCK:

Exactly, but what we're asking

this Court ­­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So I don't understand why

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

28
1

one is reliable and the other is not reliable, other

2

than the formalistic argument which I can understand.

3

MR. BABCOCK:

And we are certainly not

4

saying that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is

5

reliable, and neither does Nichols.

6

at Justice Souder's concurrence in Nichols,

7

realistically what's being stated here is that because

8

if there is no deprivation of liberty, that the

9

unreliability is essentially tolerated.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. BABCOCK:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. BABCOCK:

17

But did anybody object at

that time and say this sentence is unconstitutional?

13

16

But in this

particular case, Mr. Bryant was incarcerated.

11
12

If we take a look

No.

Mr. Bryant ­­

Okay, so ­­

­­ did not have a right to

counsel.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

But, I mean, is

18

anybody here now claiming that the sentence was

19

unconstitutional at the time?

20

MR. BABCOCK:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22
23
24
25

say that in your brief?
MR. BABCOCK:

I a.m., Your Honor.
You have?

Where did you

Because they say you didn't.
I ­­ I, of course, I filed a

motion to dismiss on ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm saying in your

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

29
1

brief in this Court, have you claimed that the sentence,

2

the proceeding in the Indian court violated the Federal

3

Constitution?

4

MR. BABCOCK:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

We have not.
Okay.

Well, then, I take

6

it that for purposes here, you concede that.

7

see how you can get around the fact you haven't

8

complained.

9

I don't

So if it's a valid conviction, why can't you

10

use it?

11

to more; that's what Nichols says.

12

them to three times the sentence without any conviction.

13

You would just introduce some evidence that he hit his

14

wife before badly.

I mean, you could ­­ you could sentence people

15

You could sentence

You could ­­ you could raise the sentence if

16

it was a civil ­­ if it was a civil case.

17

there was a judgment in favor of the wife, I take it.

18

So why can't you raise the sentence on the ground that

19

there is a valid conviction, period?

20

Which is, I think, what Nichols said.

21

MR. BABCOCK:

And ­­ and

End of the case.

Well, Nichols also dealt with

22

an underlying conviction in which the Sixth Amendment

23

did exist.

24
25

And in this particular case, once we ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

But you have told me

that you have not ­­ I don't see how you could send a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

30
1

person to prison on the basis of the ­­ the lack ­­

2

where there's no counsel.

3

that, then I don't see why the Federal government can't

4

later use it if that's valid.

5

MR. BABCOCK:

If the Indian tribes can do

Well, I think the reason why

6

is because of the United States District Court, and

7

certainly, in this Court, the Sixth Amendment does

8

exist.

9

And the only ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

And then we should hold

10

that ­­ I guess, that all of the convictions in all the

11

tribes that are using, going to jail where people might

12

go to prison for more than six months or at all, for a

13

day, all those are invalid.

14

MR. BABCOCK:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

If they're ­­
Then the law of Congress is

16

unconstitutional.

17

asked us to hold that, so I don't know that we should

18

hold that in this case.

19

Is that ­­ is that ­­ but no one's

MR. BABCOCK:

Well, we're certainly not

20

challenging the constitutionality of the Indian Civil

21

Rights Act, but we are certainly ­­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's the

23

question, which is:

24

conviction violative of the Constitution?

25

Standing alone, was that earlier

MR. BABCOCK:

It was not, because it was in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

31
1

tribal court.

2

Any other court, it would be.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.

And so you're

3

not challenging that the Bill of Rights do not apply ­­

4

because we've long held that ­­ don't apply to Indian

5

courts, correct?

6

MR. BABCOCK:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

They don't apply to

English courts ­­

MR. BABCOCK:

10
11

Correct.

Correct.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

­­ and other foreign

courts.

12

MR. BABCOCK:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
And there are plenty of

14

foreign courts, like England for a time ­­ I think it's

15

changing it now ­­ where they would convict people after

16

a magisterial inquisition where the defendant didn't

17

have counsel.

18

the Constitution?

19
20

You're not saying that process violates

MR. BABCOCK:

No, I'm not saying that

process violates the Constitution.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're saying simply

22

because we're using that conviction, we now violated.

23

Why?

24
25

Nichols, as I understand it, had two
rationales:

One that says using a prior constitutional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

32
1

conviction, one that doesn't violate the Constitution,

2

is not enhancing a sentence, is not changing that

3

earlier conviction.

4

that earlier conviction, so you can use it, because it's

5

just setting the platform for the current punishment,

6

for the conduct now.

7
8

It's not enhancing a sentence for

How does your argument ­­ why does your
argument change that rationale?

9

MR. BABCOCK:

I think a big reason why is

10

our fundamental difference between guilt phase and

11

sentencing phase.

12

the offer ­­

13

And certainly if we take a look at

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, we ­­ Nichols

14

itself said enhancement statutes, whether in the nature

15

of criminal history provisions, such as those contained

16

in the Sentencing Guidelines, or recidivist statutes

17

that are commonplace in State criminal law, those

18

recidivist statutes make prior convictions an element,

19

do not change the penalty imposed for an earlier

20

conviction.

21

rationale covered both.

22

MR BABCOCK:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

That's what Nichols said.

So the Nichols

I read ­­
Covered sentencing

guidelines and covered recidivist statutes.
MR. BABCOCK:

I think the difference here is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

33
1

that it's being used to establish an essential element

2

of the offense.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MR. BABCOCK:

5

And it ­­ it's not technically

6
7

I know, but ­­

Nichols said that's

okay.

MR. BABCOCK:

It's not technically, we
It's not ­­

10

example ­­ for, like, 21 U.S.C. 851, in a controlled

11

substance, doubling the mandatory minimum.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, it says it was

13

relying on recidivist statutes that are commonplace in

14

State criminal laws.

15

MR. BABCOCK:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

Correct.
All right.

And those

make them an element of the crime.

18

MR. BABCOCK:

They make them an element of

19

the crime, but ­­ but Chief Justice Rehnquist also went

20

on to talk about the less exacting standard that is

21

attached to the sentencing proceeding than at the guilt

22

phase.

Also, what ­­

23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's the second prong

of Nichols.
MR. BABCOCK:

It is.

And in talking about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

34
1

that, if you're taking a look at the less exacting

2

standard, of course, what we have to do is rely upon the

3

preponderance of the evidence in a sentencing scheme.

4

If we take a look at the determination at the guilt

5

phase, which Justice Ginsburg brought out in Shelton,

6

the big difference is that has to be proven beyond a

7

reasonable doubt.

8

meaningful adversarial system that this Court holds as a

9

fundamental right since Gideon, the entire ­­

10
11
12

And if it was not subjected to the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But isn't that a due

process argument?
MR. BABCOCK:

I believe that the due process

13

and the Sixth Amendment argument are certainly

14

intertwined in this case.

15

due process error, we have been stating the entire time

16

that's because Mr. Bryant is having an uncounseled

17

conviction being used as an essential element in a

18

subsequent Federal prosecution.

And if there is a procedural

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I can see ­­
Well, that's ­­
­­ the distinction

22

between ­­ that you made between beyond a reasonable

23

doubt and preponderance of the evidence, but

24

practically, I mean, what's involved here is proof of a

25

conviction entered by a court.

And so you ­­ you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

35
1

present the certified copy of the judgment, and that's

2

it.

That satisfies proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

3

MR. BABCOCK:

I think that this Court, in

4

taking a look at convictions themselves, if you want to

5

take a look at cases such as Tucker and as Loper, it

6

wasn't enough.

7

convictions were obtained and whether or not the

8

procedural safeguards of the Sixth Amendment right to

9

counsel was adhered to was of the utmost importance.

10

The actual process and how those

If we take a look at the case in Loper, that

11

was being used for impeachment purposes.

12

purposes, the Court held that that fell into that ­­ a

13

different stage under the determination of guilt.

14

even for impeachment purposes ­­ and I do understand

15

that the difference is that has to deal with a felony

16

conviction.

17

for impeachment purposes, it wasn't enough for the trial

judge to be able to just take a look at the conviction

19

and let that in.

would now have for an uncounseled misdemeanor

conviction, we would have actually waiving your right to

9

waive a right he didn't possess.

Certainly Mr. Bryant didn't do that.

10

Second, he's not indigent.

He can't

reason to do a financial affidavit, because there's no

right to counsel so we don't have to determine that

that would be if it came from tribal court.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MS. PRELOGAR:

8

I'd like to begin by responding to

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Respondent's point that there is a less exacting

10

standard that's applied at sentencing.

11

include that language, but as I read the Court's opinion

12

there, Nichols was actually drawing a contrast between

13

trying to relitigate the underlying facts that led to

14

that prior conviction versus relying on the prior

15

conviction itself.

16

defendant is in some respects better on when you look at

17

just the fact of the prior conviction because that

18

conviction represents an adjudication of guilty beyond a

19

reasonable doubt.

20

Nichols did

And Nichols observed that a

Well, that's the same representation that

21

the prior conviction has when it's used at the guilt

22

stage.

23

beyond a reasonable doubt.

24
25

Thereto, that prior misconduct had to be proven

The kind of distinction that Respondent
would have this Court draw would resurrect essentially

what ­­ what prevailed under this Court's decision in

2

Baldasar, where you would have a hybrid conviction that

3

would be good for its own purposes and valid and

4

constitutional in the original proceeding, but would

5

lapse into unconstitutionality and become invalid when

6

you tried to use it subsequently.

7

overruled Baldasar and Nichols, and we'd urge the Court

8

not to return to that kind of hyperconviction.

9

The Court obviously

And finally, I don't understand Respondent

10

himself to actually be adhering to this sentencing

11

versus elements line, because again, he's conceded.

12

the tribal court had fined him, it would be perfectly

13

fine to use those prior tribal court convictions as an

14

element of the Section 117 offense.

15

If

I'd also like to respond to Respondent's

16

suggestion that all uncounseled misdemeanor convictions

17

are unreliable.

18

the line this Court drew in Scott and Argersinger.

19

just cannot be the case that this Court was willing to

20

interpret the Sixth Amendment to tolerate wholly

21

unreliable convictions in that context.

22

that the Scott­Argersinger line reflects that the

23

assistance of counsel is not essential to an accurate

24

and reliable determination of guilt in that context.

25

I think that that's wholly at odds with
It

Rather, I think

And to the extent that that was left in any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official ­ Subject to Final Review

42
1

doubt, I think Nichols confirms the point.

2

Nichols, the argument was made that although those prior

3

uncounseled convictions might have been sufficiently

4

reliable when there was less at stake, they should not

5

be relied upon in a subsequent proceeding where the

6

stakes are much higher.

7

by that, and I think rightly accepted the line that if

8

the conviction was obtained in a proceeding that was

9

sufficiently reliable to adjudicate the defendant's

Because in

But this Court wasn't persuaded

10

guilt in the first instance, then there is no way to say

11

that that proceeding suddenly becomes fundamentally

12

unfair and unreliable when you're giving effect to that

13

valid, constitutional prior conviction subsequently.

14

And then the final thing I would note is

15

that although there's been a lot of talk about fairness

16

here, I think it is important to recognize that

17

Respondent had it entirely within his power to not have

18

a Federal court consider these prior tribal court

19

convictions.

20

he should have done is stop abusing his domestic

21

partners.

22

tribal convictions, because he kept battering women in

23

Indian country and contributed to that epidemic of

24

domestic violence, I don't think he should be heard to

25

complain that he's being prosecuted under Section 117.
