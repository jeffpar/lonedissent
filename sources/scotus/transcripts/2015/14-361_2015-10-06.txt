ORAL ARGUMENT OF ETHAN P. DAVIS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. DAVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Hobbs Act requires that a defendant

12

obtain property from another.

13

was charged with conspiring with the owners of a repair

14

shop not to obtain property from another, but from the

15

owners themselves.

16

In this case, Mr. Ocasio

19

property between themselves, not to obtain property from

structure, and basic criminal ­­ principles of criminal

22

law all point in the same direction.

23

English or State cases involving conspiracies to extort

24

property from a co­conspirator.

When two people agree that one will pay the

But we don't think

Is it ­­ is it well

established, or even not well established, that you are

15

obtaining property under color of law when you give

16

somebody a bribe?

17

MR. DAVIS:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your Honor ­­
It seems to me ­­ what that

19

means to me under color of law is you ­­ you pretend to

20

have a legal right to it, which in fact you don't have.

21

MR. DAVIS:

Justice Scalia, until 1992, I

22

think that was an open question, but this Court decided

23

in Evans v. United States in '92 that Hobbs Act

24

extortion encompasses the paying of ­­ of bribes.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I dissented, I assume.

2

MR. DAVIS:

You did.

But, Your Honor, I

3

think that that ­­ the decision in Evans was really the

4

high­water mark of this Court's Hobbs Act jurisprudence.

5

And since then the Court has been careful not to expand

6

the Hobbs Act ­­

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we have stated that

8

a person may be liable for conspiracy even though he was

9

incapable of committing the substantive offense.

Does

10

that carry the day for the government's argument here,

11

or is that distinguishable at principle?

12
13

MR. DAVIS:

I think that's distinguishable

in principle, Justice Kennedy.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. DAVIS:

And why?

Well, certainly not every

16

conspirator must personally commit every element of the

17

substantive offense.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But he might not even be

19

capable of it, must not even be capable of it, as I

20

understand what we've said.

21

MR. DAVIS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

22

Must ­­ need not even be capable of committing every

23

element of the substantive offense, but each conspirator

24

must specifically intend that someone commit every

25

element of the substantive offense.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why isn't that test

2

satisfied here, because the shop owners agreed that

3

Mr. Ocasio would commit every element of the substantive

4

offense?

5

MR. DAVIS:

The shop owners, Your Honor,

6

agree that Mr. Ocasio would obtain property from

7

another, not from themselves.

So I think that ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that any stranger than

12

the Mann Act situation, where the woman who is being

13

transported across State lines for immoral purposes,

14

conspires with the person who is transporting her across

15

State lines?

16

That's permissible, isn't it?
MR. DAVIS:

Justice Alito, I think yes, it

17

is.

18

first is that the Mann Act used the phrase "any woman,"

19

not "another woman."

20

different if it had used the phrase "another woman."

21

And two distinctions from the Mann Act cases:

The

I think that case would have been

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, "any woman" is broader

22

than "another woman."

23

3.5 billion­plus women in the world, and that subsumes

24

"another woman," doesn't it?

25

MR. DAVIS:

"Any woman" means any of

I don't think so, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

8
1

mean, I think that if a woman agreed to transport any

2

woman, it makes sense to think that she could transport

3

herself across State lines, but if the statute had said

4

"another woman," it doesn't make sense to say that she

5

could have transported another woman when she was merely

6

transporting herself.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, they're two different

8

words, but the syntactical problem seems to me to be

9

identical, which is that it's just not natural to say

10

that the transported woman is herself transporting any

11

woman, right?

12

transporting any woman.

13

I mean, the transported woman is not

But the reason the Court said that a

14

conspiracy was possible there was because the

15

transported woman could agree with another person, let's

16

say, the man, that the man would transport any woman,

17

namely, herself.

18

syntactical issue.

19

It's ­­ it's an almost identical

MR. DAVIS:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

20

think that transporting another woman would create a

21

much bigger textual issue than transporting any woman.

22

If the woman goes to the man who is

23

transporting her and says, I'd like to help you

24

transport another woman, he would think that she is

25

talking about someone else, not about herself.

Alderson Reporting Company

It's

I

Official

9
1

much more natural in the context of "any woman."

2

The other reason those cases are

3

distinguishable, Your Honor, is because they use the

4

verb "transport" instead of "obtain."

5

conceivable to transport yourself; it's not really ­­ it

6

doesn't really make sense to obtain property from

7

yourself.

8
9

It's ­­ it's

So I think those are distinguishable on
those grounds.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What difference did it

11

make in this ­­ you're ­­ you're not contesting the

12

extortion convictions, right?

13

conspiracy; is that right?

14

MR. DAVIS:

You ­­ it's only the

That's correct, Your Honor, with

15

an asterisk, and that is if we were to prevail here, we

16

would go back to the Fourth Circuit and ask to vacate

17

the substantive convictions also on the basis of

18

spillover prejudice.

the other person here?

19

MR. DAVIS:

So why isn't Majestic

Your Honor, the government

20

forfeited any argument that Majestic is the "another" by

not raising it at any ­­ at any stage in this Court,

in ­­ either in its cert stage briefing or in the ­­

anything, shows that Majestic was an LLC and then it

3

became a corporation at some point later.

4

clear when.

5

The testimony, to the extent it shows

It's not

But I think the government didn't raise that

6

argument for a good reason, and that's because the

7

testimony also showed that Moreno and Mejia were the

8

sole owners of Majestic, and that there was no

9

difference between them in practical effect.

10
11

So in ­­ in practice, the money really came
from the ­­ from Moreno and Mejia, not from ­­

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Moreno and Mejia are

13

two ­­ are two people; they're not the same person,

money, right?

So I assume even if it was ­­ let's say it was a

correct.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So Moreno could conspire

with Ocasio to obtain money from Mejia and Mejia

21

could conspire with Ocasio to obtain money from Moreno.

22

MR. DAVIS:

Your Honor, I don't think that

that theory works in this case because the bribes came

from them jointly.

25

together.

The payments came from them

They ­­ they were both aware of what each

Alderson Reporting Company

2

indistinguishable for purposes of this.

Did this government argue

4

this proposition as its theory of the case in the trial

court or here?

6

MR. DAVIS:

No, not that theory of the case,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You ­­ you acknowledge that

the ­­ that the police officer is ­­ is guilty of a

violation of the Hobbs Act, never mind the conspiracy,

We're not directly challenging

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if you don't ­­ if

15

you don't challenge that here, I ­­ as I recall, your

establish a Federal law of bribery for the whole

country.

charge.

That's a national bribery law, isn't it?

2

3

get both.

4

MR. DAVIS:

Well, Your Honor, if ­­ if this

5

Court were to extend Evans in this case to cover not

6

only the public official side of the transaction but

7

also the private citizen side of the transaction, that

would be a dramatic expansion of the law of bribery.

correct, but I think it was the high­water mark, and the

12

further in the years since.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about ­­ what

14

do you do with the government's argument that Ocasio was

15

conspiring with other police officers to get the money

16

from another?

17

from another, the ­­ the two individuals.

18

In other words, that conspiracy got money

MR. DAVIS:

Two responses to that, Your

19

Honor.

20

the jury could have convicted Ocasio based on a

21

conspiracy solely between him and the repair shop

22

owners, and under this Court's decision in Skilling, if

23

a ­­ if the jury could have returned a legally­invalid

24

verdict, the conviction has to be reversed.

25

The first is that under the jury instructions,

And I think that's a sufficient answer to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

the question, but my second answer is that we disagree

2

with the government that there was sufficient evidence

3

in the record linking Ocasio with other police officers.

4

The evidence showed only that these police officers were

5

generally aware of what each other were doing.

6

didn't show that they formed an agreement to work

7

together.

8

it was a hub­and­spokes conspiracy without the rim

9

enclosing the spokes.

10

It

And under this Court's decision in Kotteakos,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think if I'm

11

remembering the government's response to your first

12

point, is that it certainly would have been harmless

13

error in this case.

14

MR. DAVIS:

Your Honor, I find that response

15

a little difficult to understand.

16

overwhelmingly focused on linking Ocasio with Moreno and

17

Mejia, not with other police officers.

18

majority of the testimony was about Moreno and Mejia

19

forming an agreement with Ocasio.

20

The ­­ the trial

The vast

The government's whole case went through

21

Moreno and Mejia.

22

much more difficult case if it had to prove an agreement

23

between police officers to obtain property from Moreno

and Mejia.

25

an agreement.

And the government would have had a

There just wasn't that much evidence of such

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15

Everything, again, went through that, hub of

2

Moreno and Mejia.

3

it would have been harmless error, let alone that the

4

jury would even have convicted if it had been instructed

5

that it had to find an agreement between multiple police

6

officers.

7

So it's hard for me to imagine that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MR. DAVIS:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think

Well, is that ­­ that

8

begs Justice Kagan's question, which is they wanted

9

Ocasio ­­ they wanted the police officer to act under

color of right and to take the bribe.

11

MR. DAVIS:

And I think the key problem with

12

that, Your Honor, is that the repair shop owners did not

13

intend to help Ocasio obtain property from another.

14

They intended to help Ocasio obtain property from

themselves.

16

of purpose here.

17

And I think that's why there's not a unity

I mean, all ­­ everyone may have agreed on

the same course of conduct, like the government says.

4

people agree that somebody should obtain property from

5

6

It is, of

And that's exactly the situation here.
MR. DAVIS:

Your Honor, I think that, again,

7

the repair shop owners did not intend to obtain property

8

from another.

9

And ­­ and I think the way that ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They intended and they

10

agreed that Mr. Ocasio should obtain property from

11

another.

12

And that's all they have to do.
MR. DAVIS:

Your Honor, I think going back

13

to how that kind of conversation would happen in

14

ordinary English is a way to see why it's not plausible

15

to read the statute like that.

16

If the repair shop owners go to Ocasio and

17

say, I want to help you obtain property from another,

18

Ocasio would think that they're talking about someone

19

else.

20

more formalistic.

21

I think the government's interpretation is much

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's a statute, and the

22

statute just says the other has to be somebody different

23

from Ocasio himself.

24

somebody other is the people who are in the agreement.

25

In another case, the somebody other might be somebody

So in this particular case, the

2

the ­­ the substantive law says it has to be from

another.

4

The statute just ­­

The conspiracy ­­ and this is just ­­ it's

5

consistent with Salinas, it's consistent with Holt, it's

6

consistent with everything we've ever said about

7

conspiracy law ­­ is that it just has to be an agreement

8

for somebody to do that substantive offense even if the

9

people agree and can't do it themselves.

10

And it's true, the people agreeing can't do

11

it themselves.

12

But Mr. Ocasio can, and they're agreeing that he should.

13

They can't obtain property from another.

MR. DAVIS:

Your Honor, even if that's a

14

plausible interpretation of the statute, which we don't

15

think it is, it's definitely not the most natural way to

16

read it.

17

statute, they would ­­ they would say that if you agree

I ­­ I think that is a ground,

text of the statute.

I mean, Evans ­­ in Evans, the ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Davis, if you could go

11

12

there is a difference between ­­ there ­­ there are

13

cases in which somebody participates in a kickback

scheme and does not consent.

15

And ­­ and

I mean, suppose some public official comes

in and says, in order for me to give you a license to do

17

something, to be, you know, a member of some profession,

area there where someone just acquiesces to an official

demand like you're saying.

Those may not be

5

conspiratorial agreements.

But I think still, there is

6

a large category of bribery cases that would ­­ would

7

still be conspiratorial agreements under the

8

government's theory, anytime someone, like in Salinas,

9

pays a bribe in exchange for official action and wasn't

10

I think there is a gray

required to do so.

11

So I think still the government's theory

12

would render some of the language in 666 unnecessary.

15

none of ­­ the bribe has to be over $5,000.

17

or more in Federal funds.

cases, the government could just avoid those limitations

19

by charging the case as a conspiracy to commit extortion

20

under the Hobbs Act.

21

And the ­­ and

And that's even though there may be a

22

category of cases that would not be a conspiratorial

Act.

25

On one more textual point, Your Honors, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

statute also punishes whoever conspires to obtain

2

property from another, which, I think, reinforces our

3

reading that the "whoever" who obtains the property has

4

to be a different person from the "another" from whom

5

property is obtained.

6

And I think the general conspiracy statute

gets to the same place by just a slightly more

8

circuitous route.

10

It punishes each person who conspires

MR. KEDEM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

A conspiracy is an agreement to commit an

offense against the United States, that is, a joint

25

commitment to a plan that, if completed, would satisfy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

all elements of the substantive offense.

2

conspirators must agree on that goal, no particular

3

member of the conspiracy must agree that he, himself,

4

will commit all or even any of the substantive elements

5

of the offense.

6

And while all

And so you don't ask whether all

7

conspirators or the conspiracy as a whole agreed to

8

obtain property from another any more than you would ask

9

whether the conspiracy as a whole acted under color of

10
11

official right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do ­­ do you agree that

12

under your approach, every private individual who seeks

13

to bribe a State official is liable for conspiracy to

14

commit Hobbs Act extortion?

15
16
17
18

MR. KEDEM:

We don't.

And that's because of

active participation.
Let me explain where that comes from and
then how it applies to this case.

19

Holte and Gebardi concerned the Mann Act,

20

which prohibited the transportation of a woman across

21

State lines for immoral purposes.

22

whether a woman who was transported could conspire to

23

violate the Act.

24
25

And the question was

In answering that question, the Court
focused on two things.

First of all, although the Act

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

contemplates the involvement of the woman, it doesn't

2

impose substantive criminal liability on her.

3

second, some minimal form of agreement is an inherent

4

feature of most instances of the offense.

5

And,

Based on those two factors, the Court said,

6

if that's all there is, if the only thing that the woman

7

agrees to is to the transportation itself, that is, the

8

bare outlines of the crime, that by itself would be

9

insufficient to make her a conspirator.

But if she were

10

to agree to do more ­­ if, for instance, she were to

11

purchase the tickets or to arrange the transportation in

12

some other way ­­ then she could be a conspirator.

13

And so in this case, with respect to a bribe

14

pair, if all the bribe pair agrees to do is turn over

15

money in return for official acts, that by itself would

16

be insufficient to make the bribe pair a conspirator.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose he arranges

18

to meet on the park bench at 2:00 o'clock, and has a

19

follow­up call to the official to please be there.

20

that ­­ does that suffice?

21

MR. KEDEM:

I think that would be incidental

22

to the one thing that they're really agreeing to do,

23

which is to turn over the money.

24
25

Is

But contrast that with what happened in this
case.

Because Moreno and Mejia didn't just hand over an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

envelope with $100 bills in it.

2

conjunction with police officers, including Petitioner.

3

They worked closely in

For instance, when Petitioner went to the

4

scene of an accident, he would call Moreno, and they

5

would talk about what cars were involved:

6

model, the year, what extent of damage was involved.

7

And then Moreno would consult with Petitioner about

8

which cars would be most lucrative to have in the shop.

9

And so it wasn't simply a case of agreeing

10

to the bare outlines of the crime.

11

facilitate it in additional ways.

MR. KEDEM:

to turn over money in return for official acts, then

that by itself is insufficient.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, before you do,

3

I'm still stuck on the jury instructions.

4

your brief language on Joint Appendix page 195 where the

5

judge says ­­ I think these are the instructions.

6

I'm wrong, but you cite them, where the judge says mere

7

knowledge or acquiescence without participation in the

8

unlawful plan is not sufficient.

10

you're talking about with ­­
MR. KEDEM:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's ­­
­­ "the jury was

instructed."

MR. KEDEM:

That was given ­­ given the

15

jury, but I think that's the standard conspiracy

16

instruction.

17

Maybe

Is that ­­ that's the language, I take it,

You cite in

19

no bearing on the issue of his guilt."

That suggests to me something that goes to the extent of

22

the defendant's participation.

23

MR. KEDEM:

That's right.

And I just

A different

instruction would be given, but it's important to

25

emphasize that Petitioner did not appeal the failure to

at trial.

9

In fact, that was Petitioner's very theory

But let me give you an example of how

10

Petitioner's argument with regard to "from another" does

11

not necessarily only focus on the Hobbs Act.

12

the for instance, there was a statute that said if you

13

steal from a bank while pointing a gun at another, it's

14

aggravated bank robbery.

15

his friend, you go into the bank ahead of me.

16

in, point a gun at your head, and say, cashier give me

17

all of your money.

18

Imagine

And imagine a robber says to
I'll run

According to Petitioner, that would not be

19

conspiracy, because judged ­­ from the perspective of

20

the conspiracy as a whole, no gun was pointed at

21

another.

22

every element of the substantive offense has to be

23

judged in a conspiracy from the perspective of the

24

conspiracy as a single, undifferentiated whole.

25

And at base, Petitioner's argument is that

A couple responses to that.

Alderson Reporting Company

First of all,

Official

40
1

it's not even clear what that means; for instance, how

2

it could be that a conspiracy as a whole obtains

3

property under color of official right.

4

Second of all, it contradicts the very

5

premise behind conspiracy liability, which is that

6

different members of the conspiracy agree to play

7

different roles, and it's only when you add those

8

various roles together that you get the completed

9

offense.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm afraid you haven't

MR. KEDEM:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the other reason your

hypothetical doesn't work too well is we know that he's

MR. KEDEM:

So it

Well, Justice Kennedy, I would

point you then to the statute that we cite that talks

about someone who is a government official who receives

6

coded, secret information from another and provides it

17

I don't think it works for a couple

First of all, the word "whoever" in

18

Subsection A ­­ and this is best addressed if looking

19

directly at the words of the statute at page 2a to the

20

appendix to our brief.

21

not the subject of the phrase "obtaining of property

22

from another" in Subsection (b)(2).

23

private citizen could ever be member of a conspiracy

24

because no private citizen can obtain property from

25

another under color of official right.

"Whoever," in Subsection (a), is

Alderson Reporting Company

If it were, then no

Official

Instead, the word "whoever" is the subject

2

of the phrase "obstructs, delays, or affects commerce"

3

by extortion or agrees or conspires so to do.

4

give you an example of how that can be affected, even if

5

you yourself are not the person who commits the

6

extortion, imagine a case of robbery in which there is a

7

central organizer who brings together robbers who have

8

various skills and gives them a plan but doesn't himself

9

intend to participate in the robbery.

would have conspired to obstruct, delay, or affect

extortion.

15

they actively facilitated that obstructed, delayed, and

conspiring to ­­ to do something to get a consent that

10

MR. KEDEM:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Justice Breyer ­­
You could conspire to

12

attempt to get it, but not to get it, if you're being

13

really picky on these words.

14

MR. KEDEM:

The issue of consent is really a

15

red herring in this case, because as my friend just

16

stated, consent from the common law for extortion falls

17

well below the meeting of the minds that you would need

18

for conspiratorial agreement.

19

clear by the fact that even in cases of coercive

20

extortion, that is extortion induced by wrongful use of

21

actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, you would

22

still need consent.

23

And that much is made

And so the type of agreement that we're

24

talking about, with or without the active participation

25

requirement, is well above the threshold for consent

MR. KEDEM:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't ­­
I think, as one of my

15

colleagues said, there was a conspiracy here to get

16

money from the victims.

17

MR. KEDEM:

I don't think, Justice

18

Sotomayor, that our argument is you would never have

19

instances in which the conspiracy provision would apply.

20

I think what we're saying is, this is precisely the type

21

of scenario in which conspiracy liability should attach.

22

And I think there may be a sense by some that clever

23

prosecutors, maybe in some cases, are pushing the bounds

24

of conspiracy law beyond where they're ­­ traditionally

25

have gone, and using it in ways that perhaps are not

Alderson Reporting Company

47

warranted.

2

Whatever the merits of that criticism as a

3

general matter, this is not that case.

4

conspiracy in this case was a durable, multifaceted,

5

criminal enterprise that had a division of labor and

succeeded over the course of several years in committing

That's why they do it; isn't it?
MR. KEDEM:

That is true, Justice Breyer,

3

but they didn't necessarily commit a crime against the

4

customer if all they did is repair the customer's car.

5

Now, they did also commit various forms of insurance

6

fraud, but put that to the side.

7

In this scheme, if all they did was get

8

money from a customer and fix the car as promised, then

9

they would not have committed a crime necessarily

against the customer.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, indeed, isn't it right

that what Justice Breyer is saying was the very theory

behind Evans, why this was extortion, is because the

charging simply the substantive offense.
MR. KEDEM:

It does ­­ it does,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, but that would still have been true

4

even if Moreno and Mejia were not charged as

5

co­conspirators because there was voluminous evidence ­­

6

and we cited in the last portion of our brief ­­ that

7

Petitioner conspired with other police officers as well.

8

For instance, he was recruited into the scheme by

9

another police officer, probably Officer Rodriguez, who

10
11

was indicted along with him.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you ­­ do you

MR. KEDEM:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

think there was a specific instruction to the jury one

10

way or another about whether they either could or

11

couldn't find it just based on Moreno and Mejia.

Gebardi to ­­ to Hobbs Act prosecutions really dealt

with aiding and abetting, not with conspiracy.

21

much easier to see how the active participant standard

22

applies in the context of aiding and abetting, which

23

requires acts beyond mere agreement.

24
25

And it's

But in the context of conspiracy, the only
court really to have applied the active participant

standard to conspiracy in any, in any significant way

was the Fourth Circuit in the Spitler decision.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Will you, in your answer,

4

get to what I think is the main point; the main point

5

being, look, two policemen and a shop owner.

6

policemen say, give us money and we'll help you out

7

later.

That's extortion.

8
9

The

All right.

If that's extortion, then why isn't it
conspiracy when, three weeks before they meet and bit by

10

bit say, we will do that very thing which is

11

extortion ­­

12

MR. DAVIS:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think ­­
­­ the shopkeeper is

14

helping the policemen do what is the thing that counts

15

as extortion and, therefore, he's conspired with them.

16

That's their very simple argument.

17

MR. DAVIS:

A simple answer is?

The simple answer is that's not

18

consistent with how ­­ with ordinary English, Your

19

Honor.

go to the public official and say, I'd like to help you

21

obtain property from another ­­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

The "other" ­­

"another" means another other than the two policemen.

another other than them.

3

And the law says that it's another ­­

MR. DAVIS:

I think the only way the

4

government can make that sound plausible is by adding

5

words to the statute ­­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no words.

another, means not the two policemen; it means Sam.

Joe and Bill are the policemen; Sam is the
In the substantive crime, the other,

10

Sam, two weeks earlier, helped and conspired with the

11

two policemen to get money from another; namely, Sam.

12

MR. DAVIS:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. DAVIS:

And

And ­­
Odd, but English.

Justice Breyer, I think the

There is a difference here, but that's the

this case, is doing the acts of obtaining property from

2

another.

3

from the perspective of the person who has agreed to

4

help him do that.

And you are insisting that it be looked at

5

But there's no reason under standard

6

conspiracy law that we would use the perspective of the

7

agreer rather than the perspective of the perpetrator.

8

MR. DAVIS:

9

don't agree with that.

Justice Kagan, with respect, I
I think that under standard

10

conspiracy law, you look at the perspective of both.

11

You have to have a unity of purpose with each

12

conspirator to do the same thing.

13
14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There absolutely is a unity

of purpose, that one person should do the crime.
