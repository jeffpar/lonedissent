ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. SMITH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. SMITH:

For over a century, the following three
things have been true in the disputed area.

12
13

First, the non­Indian population has always
been greater than 98 percent.

14
15

Second, the Tribe never exercised
jurisdiction.

16
17

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10
11

We'll hear argument

And third, by contrast, the State of
Nebraska has governed the disputed area.

18

The story of the disputed area is that of a

19

land that long ago lost its Indian character, if it ever

20

had any.

21

happened for a reason.

22

the ­­ or the intent of Congress in the context of the

23

times of the 1882 Act that the disputed area would be

24

diminished from the reservation.

25

The three things I mentioned at the outset
They happened because it was

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If I understand your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

position correctly, you're not asking us to overrule

2

Solem?

3

MR. SMITH:

No.

No, Your Honor.

We are not

4

asking you to overrule Solem.

5

asking the Court to do is to imply ­­ apply the entire

6

Solem rule and, in particular, the compelling third

7

factor of the subsequent circumstances of the land's

8

jurisdictional history.

9

In fact, what we are

As ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

From what ­­ from what

10

you just said and from your brief, I gathered ­­ perhaps

11

I was wrong ­­ that you are arguing for a de facto

12

diminishment test; that is, you pointed out the area has

13

been overwhelmingly populated by non­Indians and they ­­

14

they ­­ they haven't attempted before to exercise

15

governing authority.

16

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, we think the

17

de facto diminishment does fit within the third element

18

of the Solem test, which is the subsequent circumstances

19

of ­­ of after the enactment.

20

not be opposed to the Court concluding and reaching this

21

decision on the grounds of de facto diminishment.

22

And so obviously we would

But we also think this case fits within this

23

Court's precedent under Solem, which would involve ­­

24

in ­­ in our view, the third element of the test is

25

particularly strong and compelling in this case, while

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

in Solem, in that particular case, it was ­­ it was ­­ I

2

guess I would call fairly easy to distinguish because,

3

as Solem talks about as far as the events, what took

4

place after the Act, the focus should be ­­ if you're

5

looking at intent of Congress, you should be looking at

6

what Congress is doing after the Act that is reflective

7

of not understanding essentially that they've diminished

8

the reservation.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a different Congress.

10

I mean, to say, you know, a later Congress did thus and

11

so, and therefore the earlier Congress, when it enacted

12

a particular statute, must have diminished.

13

doesn't make any sense.

14

MR. SMITH:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That

It ­­
And ­­ and ­­ and moreover,

16

if ­­ if the third factor is dispositive, as ­­ as you

17

assert, you would not ­­ we would not need the ­­ the ­­

18

the de facto diminishment doctrine whereby, by a sort

19

of, you know, adverse possession, a jurisdiction,

20

whether it's Indians or ­­ or even a State that used to

21

have a jurisdiction over a particular area has forfeited

22

it by long­, long­accepted usage to the contrary.

23

If ­­ if that is true and ­­ and if ­­ if

24

the third factor is as important as you say, we would

25

not need that doctrine.

We ­­ we would just find

Alderson Reporting Company

diminishment.

2

MR. SMITH:

Well, and that would be

3

consistent with the concept that, if a party just ­­ if

4

they belatedly assert a claim to having sovereign

5

authority over this, as in this case it's over a hundred

6

and some years after the land was open for settlement,

7

that ­­ there ­­ at least the Sherrill case, some of the

8

principles in that case would be supportive of de facto

9

diminishment.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

the ­­ the diminishment.

13

MR. SMITH:

As far as ­­
That case didn't involve

Diminishment was not an issue.
That ­­ that is true.

I ­­ I ­­

14

what I was referring to was the ­­ the principle at

15

least decided in the case as far as a long­standing

16

assumption of jurisdiction by the State over an area

17

that is primarily non­Indian in ­­ in population land

18

creates justifiable expectations, and if they did have

19

any sovereignty over it, they had long since forfeited.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's not what you're

21

arguing here.

22

diminishment, not ­­ not adverse possession, so to

23

speak.

24
25

I ­­ I ­­ I understand you're arguing

MR. SMITH:

We are arguing that it's no

longer part of the reservation.

We are not saying it ­­

Court could not find it under the de facto, but we do

think the facts of this case does fit within Solem.

4

should prevail in this case, which ­­

You don't ­­ the

A lot of the ­­ a

10

lot of the arguments you make seem to sound more in a

11

City of Sherrill­type proposition, but you haven't

12

raised that argument, have you?

13

MR. SMITH:

We, I ­­ I believe in

14

paragraphs ­­ or pages 22, I think it's 25 of our brief,

15

we are at least citing Sherrill as ­­ as precedent for

16

the principle of loss of sovereignty, loss of sovereign

17

control by the fact that the State has long exercised

18

the jurisdiction.

19

But our focus ­­

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's based on what

21

Solem said.

22

This is on page 471 of the opinion.

23

Solem did bring up a de facto diminishment.

It says "On a more pragmatic level, we have

24

recognized that who actually moved onto the open

25

reservation lands is also relevant to deciding whether a

2

non­Indian settlers flooded into the opening portion of

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

interpreting a statute.

11

And I'm just wondering:

Is there a reason

12

why it should be more credited here than in any other

13

context?

14

MR. SMITH:

The Court's precedent, I

15

believe, recognizes in the area of land surplus acts

16

that Indian land surplus acts are a unique animal from

17

your normal legislative analysis.

18

because in the context of the times back before the turn

19

of, I guess, two centuries ago in the 1800s, Congress

20

would be doing land surplus acts in which the concept of

21

are we diminishing or not diminishing a reservation was

22

really nothing that Congress thought of.

23

And that would be

You put that on the basic principle that

24

only Congress can diminish a reservation, it then

25

becomes the problem of how do we determine what Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

intended when, frankly, the reality of the Court's

2

precedent is, it's something that Court ­­ or Congress

3

generally did not think of.

4

And so the Solem test really evolves out of an attempt

5

to determine what was the intent of Congress at the

6

time, which then is why legislative history, subsequent

7

or ­­ subsequent circumstances takes on greater

8

significance.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They were inconsistent.

When did ­­ when did this

10

diminishment idea as a legal concept ­­ you said when

11

Congress acted, they weren't thinking in terms of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

24

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

please the Court:

2

The question in this case is whether an 1882

3

Act of Congress diminished the Omaha Reservation and

4

redrew its boundaries.

5

make clear that the Act of Congress did not diminish the

6

reservation, but simply opened up a portion of the

7

reservation for settlement within the existing

8

boundaries.

We think multiple considerations

9

Now the first, and probably most

10

significant, factor is that the text of the statute uses

11

the classic language this Court has identified for

12

opening up a reservation for settlement without creating

13

a diminishment.

14

But secondly, and I think very telling and

15

specific to this statute, at the same time there is no

16

language in the statute that supports a finding of

17

diminishment.

18

Specifically, the final proviso of Section 8 that is

19

very inconsistent with the idea that what Congress did

20

is draw a new western boundary to the reservation,

21

because the ­­ that proviso gave Tribal members the

22

right to take their allotments east or west of the

23

right­of­way.

24
25

I think there is language in the statute.

And the record reflects that many ­­ that ­­
that a number of members of the Tribe took their

Alderson Reporting Company

23
1

allotments west of the right­of­way.

2

number of them took their allotments that actually

3

straddled the right­of­way.

16

There are 15 ­­

parties dispute ­­ between 10 and 15, about 850 to 900

What number?

What ­­ what is the number?

And importantly, a

Out of how many Tribal

I think there were roughly 300­plus
So it was, you know, three percent.
But I think the fact that they were allowed,

17

even though they're small numbers ­­ I'm not trying to

18

make a ­­ a volume argument here.

19

argument that if what Congress just did was draw a new

20

western boundary to the reservation, it would have been

21

very odd to allow Tribal members to take their

22

allotments off the reservation, and maybe odder still to

23

allow them to take an allotment that essentially was

24

bisected by the new boundary.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm making an

Why would that be

Official

24
1

odd?

2

couldn't they ­­

They ­­ they could have taken allotments anywhere,

3

MR. CLEMENT:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

that was opened up?

6

purchase their ­­

Anywhere ­­

Couldn't they have chosen to

7

MR. CLEMENT:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10

­­ within the area

I don't think ­­
­­ or take

allotments outside the reservation?
MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think that would have

11

been a logical assumption, given the conception of the

12

time, where I think Congress was thinking in the main

13

that Tribal ownership or Indian ownership went with the

14

reservation status.

15

And I think, again, if you think of this as

16

being a Surplus Land Act that simply opens the

17

reservation up, a portion of it to settlement, then it

18

makes perfect sense to say the Tribal members can take

19

their allotments anywhere on the reservation.

20

But if you think you've really drawn a new

21

boundary to the reservation, then I think it's more than

22

passing strange that you can take allotments to the west

23

of it, or you can take an allotment and the new border

24

is smack dab through the middle of it.

25

3

allotments were generally available, could take that

allotment off the reservation if the Indian chose to do

5

so, correct?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

couldn't.

MR. CLEMENT:

non­Indians, came in, the existing Tribal members were

13

allowed to take their allotments.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And they were allowed to take

16

their allotments anywhere on the preexisting

talking about allotments open to the general population?

MR. CLEMENT:

with the historical understanding, an allotment anywhere

on the reservation, including west of the right­of­way.

2

And that seems to me to be very consistent with the idea

3

that the right­of­way is an interesting thing that the

4

Tribe granted through their reservation, but it's not

5

some new boundary.

6

really supports that as well.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

And I think the subsequent history

What do you mean ­­

I mean, my friend on the other

side ­­

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what do you mean,

11

Mr. Clement, of the language that I read from Solem

12

itself which seems to fit this case?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I take that language,

14

Justice Ginsburg, as Justice Marshal writing for the

15

Court saying that when you're in the third factor, when

16

you witness de facto immunity ­­ I'm sorry ­­ de facto

17

sort of diminishment, that that may ultimately support a

18

conclusion that there was in fact diminishment as a

19

matter of law.

20

I don't take him to be opening up an

21

entirely different route to finding immunity ­­

22

diminishment, rather, that doesn't go through an act of

23

Congress.

24

opinion as a whole because when the Court starts the

25

opinion, it says the very first principle in this area

And I think that's the only way to read the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

is that only Congress can diminish a reservation.

2

And it's perfectly compatible with that to

3

say that when we get to the third factor and we're

4

looking at all sorts of things, we'll look at settlement

5

patterns as part of that.

6

consistent with that world view to then say that,

7

actually, the third factor is a standalone alternative

8

route to find diminishment, not by congressional action,

9

but by market reaction to a surplus land Act.

25

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm not here to tell you it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28

not a big deal.

2

two things, though.

3

I am telling ­­ I'm here to tell you

One is that Solem went out of its way to not

4

decide the diminishment issue.

5

alternative way of thinking about the cases, and I don't

6

think they're coextensive.

7

there could be a particular assertion of Tribal

8

authority that you might say violates City of Sherrill

9

principles, even within an undiminished reservation.

10

So it is clearly an

Which is to say, I think

And I do think it's then critically

11

important that ­­ my friend on the other side has not

12

raised this argument below.

13

understand it to be an independent argument in this

14

Court.

15

that doesn't make it an independent argument.

16

I certainly did not

It's all well and good to cite the case, but

Even his amici, who thought that they wanted

17

to bring before this Court the City of Sherrill

18

argument, admitted that the Petitioners hadn't made a

19

City of Sherrill argument.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But ­­ but Solem did

21

talk about de facto diminishment.

22

that you've got to recognize when they do that, they're

23

talking about something other than de jure, in other

24

words, pursuant to the law.

25

on the ground.

And it seems to me

It's pursuant to the facts

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

MR. CLEMENT:

I understand,

2

Mr. Chief Justice, but I think there's two ways to talk

3

about de facto v. de jure.

4

that they're two totally alternative routes.

5

way is to say de facto diminishment means the settlement

6

patterns, and that's something that can inform the

7

ultimate conclusion of whether there's diminishment.

8
9

One way to talk about it is
Another

And I really think the Court in Solem was
using it in that passage in the latter respect.

And I

10

think that's the only way to make sense of the case as a

11

whole, because ­­

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Except that it's ­­ it's

13

presented before the Court turns to apply the

14

principles.

15
16

MR. CLEMENT:

Exactly.

That's right.

It's

part of the general principles of the Court ­­

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

not tied to the third factor.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

It's ­­ it's not ­­ it's

Well, I ­­ I ­­ I take,

20

though, that it actually is, in my view, tied to the

21

third factor.

22

all of the factors, starting with the first and

23

governing principle, being that only Congress can

24

diminish.

25

section with this last thing about de facto/de jure ­­

I think Justice Marshall was laying out

And he winds up the sort of general principle

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

de facto diminishment, and then that ties up exactly to

2

his discussion of settlement patterns in the third

3

factor of Solem.

4

way to read that opinion.

5

And I really think that's the right

I would like to make one other very

6

important point here, though, is I think the Court

7

should understand that if you were to rule in favor of

8

Petitioners in this case, the parties would essentially

9

have to go back and reconstruct the right­of­way because

10

the railroad is no longer there.

11

Rails­For­Trails program in Thurston County.

12

take a Google map and look at this area, you can't even

13

tell where the right­of­way was.

There's no
So if you

14

Now, I think that's significant, because if

15

there really was a contemporaneous understanding in the

16

1950s and 1960s, when the railroad literally pulled up

17

its tracks and left, that the right­of­way was the

18

boundary of the reservation, then I think there would

19

have been some effort to sort of preserve that

20

jurisdictional boundary.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well ­­ well ­­ well,

22

please correct me if I'm wrong from the record.

23

my understanding was in the west portion, the Tribe had

24

done ­­ had exercised no jurisdiction until the Beverage

25

Control Ordinance recently, but on the east portion,

Alderson Reporting Company

My ­­

that they had.

2

the difference in east and west.

But then you say, well, we can't tell

3

MR. CLEMENT:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

Well, I ­­ I ­­ I ­­
And I mean, is ­­ is that

reading of the record mistaken?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I ­­ I think what there

7

is is a practical understanding ­­ as Justice Sotomayor

8

indicated, this is not a wealthy Tribe that's looking to

9

assert jurisdictions in places that are impractical.

10

it's made a judgment that most of its efforts are

11

directed at the eastern portion of the reservation.

12

But what I'm saying is ­­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So

What ­­ what ­­ but does

14

the fact that nothing, if ­­ if the record is correct ­­

15

let's assume the record shows that the Tribe exercised

16

no jurisdiction over the western portion until this

17

20

MR. CLEMENT:
dispositive.

I don't think it's

I think, yes, it's ­­

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

MR. CLEMENT:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24
25

relevant?

Is that relevant

Is it relevant?

Yes, relevant.
Why is it ­­ why is it

To what point?
MR. CLEMENT:

It ­­ it ­­ I think it could

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

be relevant to the third factor of Solem in a case where

2

the situation was very cloudy.

3

But one of the things also to keep in mind

4

is that even before Montana, the authority that a Tribe

5

would have over a principal non­Indian settlement on a

6

reservation is fairly limited.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if you're ­­
Limited to what?

What's that?
What ­­ what ­­ what does

10

it state beside the alcohol tax ­­ sales tax?

11

else, on your theory, could the Tribe do in the way of

12

governance in this area?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

What

I think as a practical matter,

14

Justice Ginsburg, there's two other things that are at

15

stake here, and they both go to the equities of the

16

Indians on the reservation, not the non­Indians, because

17

the non­Indians on the reservation, the Tribal authority

18

is very, very limited.

19

So one thing that is at issue here is the

20

potential to continue the revenue­sharing agreement with

21

the State.

22

actually came to the Tribe about.

23

revenue­sharing agreement for the fuel taxes is that

24

there are going to be transactions in the western

25

portion of the reservation where it's actually Tribal

5

those transactions.

6

And of course, the Tribe would have authority to

So what ­­

10

matter, if you prevail, can the Tribe cast any doubt on

11

the authority and the jurisdiction of the existing

12

municipality?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

No, not at all.

What they can

14

do is they can make cooperative agreements with the

15

State of Nebraska to tax Indians when they make

16

purchases in Pender.

17

And the other thing they can do is that,

18

when two Tribal members get in a scuffle in the village

that matter can be handled in the Tribal courts ­­

Tribal authority in that area?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT

10
11

Thank you, counsel.

MR. KEDEM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

In Solem v. Bartlett, this Court explained

13

that once a block of land is set aside as an Indian

14

Reservation and no matter what happens to the title of

15

individual plots within the area, the entire block

16

retains its reservation status until Congress explicitly

17

indicates otherwise.

18

It has not done so here.

I'd like to start, if I may, with the

19

question:

20

that the reservation is still intact?

21

with respect to services, States can provide services to

22

members of tribes and nonmembers alike anywhere within

23

the reservation.

24

services not only in the disputed area but on the east

25

side as well.

22

In the City of Sherrill, this Court held

I think this case is

23

that principles of equity restrained the Tribe from

24

trying to resurrect a claim of inherent sovereign

25

immunity.

Alderson Reporting Company

In this case by contrast, first of all,

2

we're not just talking about the Tribe's jurisdiction.

We're talking about the jurisdiction of the United

4

States as well.

5

And second of all, we're not talking about a

6

claim of inherent authority.

7

exercised pursuant to a Federal statute, 18 U.S.C. 1161.

could attempt but fail to diminish a reservation, as my

friend said that it did in 1872, is a concept that is

wholly foreign to this Court's jurisprudence, which

11

makes clear that Congress has plenary power.

12

And finally, I think this Court should be

13

very reluctant to assume that Congress implicitly

14

transferred any part of its authority to change the

15

borders of an Indian reservation to private parties and

16

made it contingent on what this Court in Dakota referred

to as uncertain future sales.
