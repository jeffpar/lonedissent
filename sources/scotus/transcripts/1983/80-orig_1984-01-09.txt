ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SIMMS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDATS
ME. SIMMSj

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The question before the Court is whether

12

Colorado has met the burden of establishing a basis in

13

fact which would warrant an award of water for a future

14

use in Colorado on a river that has been fully

15

appropriated and used in New Mexico.

16

Report before the Court simply adopts Colorado’s case.

17

The Master’s

Colorado's case, however, does not begin to

18

meet the standard of preponderance in ordinary civil

19

actions much less the standard of clear and convincing

20

evidence in original actions between states.

21

has recommended an award of 4,000 acre-feet.

The Master

22

The bottom line of that recommendation is his

23

conclusion that there would be no injury in New Mexico.

24

That conclusion depends upon three interdependent

25

factual predicates.

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

The first of those is that the acreage in New

2

Mexico must be cut in half.

3

New Mexico users are ready, willing and able to irrigate

4

must be cut irr half.

5

That is, the acreage that

As part cf that predicate the Canadian Fiver

6

users of Vermejo water must not even be considered by

7

the Court.

8

Vermejo in the 1970’s must not have been caused by water

9

shortage.

The reduced acreage on the main stem of the

The New Mexico water users must not have been

10

diligent, and the Court will, therefore, protect only

11

5,300 acres in New

12

Mexico instead of 9,100 acres.

Secondly, and additionally there must be in

13

New Maxico reasonable conservation measures which would

14

effectively manufacture or make available or augment the

15

supply by 4,000 acre-feet at the diversion points in

16

Colora do.

17

Thirdly, and again additionally the future use

18

of the benefits that would derive therefrom must be

19

reasonably certain and comparatively unquestionable.

20

All three of these factual predicates are essential to

21

the Master’s Report.

22

If one of those predicates fails, Colorado's

23

case fails and the Master’s Report fails.

24

the case fails on all three predicates.

25

We believe

The bottom line I believe in this case

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

generally is that there simply is not enough water in

2

the Vermejo River to make it possible to make an award

3

to Colorado for a future use.

4

decision in this case the Court indicated two ways in

5

which it might be possible to apportion water;

6

augmentation of supply in two ways, either through water

7

conservation or through the effective forfeiture of

8

water rights not diligently exercised; secondly, the

9

Court indicated that through a balancing of benefit to

first,

10

the future use in Colorado against detriment to the

11

cessation of the existing uses in New Mexico an award

12

might be made to Colorado.

13

QUESTION;

Mr. Simms, on the first point and

14

the way in which water can be augmented, how can New

15

Mexico legitimately claim that nonuse- over a thirty-year

16

period never becomes in effect an abandoment of the use

17

of a certain portion of the water?

18

that Sew Mexico can never by nonuse lose the right tc

19

use the water?

20

MB. SIMMS;

Is it your position

Not at all, and I think the

21

Court's first instruction to the Master in the first

22

area of evidence taking suggests the answer to the

23

question, Justice O'Connor.

25

levels of use, and balance cn the one hand shortage cf

21

Prior to then there was a much larger

What he does is look at Table 2 in his second

report to you.

12

17

We invite the Court to look at Table 2.

He does not compare those figures with

That is the end of the Master's analysis.

18

That is the beginning cf New Mexico’s analysis.

19

you have to dc is take those figures and do a water

he gets the figures.

1

example, you look at the year 1950 — and the Master has

2

told the Court he finds no time of material deficiency

3

or intermittent supply by looking at those figures --

4

but look at 1950 in his chart.

explaining to the Court that that is sufficient to

We believe that is patently

done so.
ME. SIMMS:

the water rights of somebody junior to it, you end up

with the same net shortage.

The reason the Master did what he did was

because he never looked at demand.

Court can apportion water according to the Master in the

has indicated in its first decision that there also the

much water might be made at the diversion points in

21

22

QUESTION;

There is no discussion of hew

Going back to the supply side

23

question again, Mr. Simms, for a minute, what did the

24

Master do about the peak flows and the floods in his

25

calculations of water availability in the Vermejo?

14
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

How

1

did he

resolve that question?

2

MR. SIMMS:

He bought Colorado's position that

3

all basin discharge is available as a practical matter

4

and divertable by the water users.

5

mistak. e.

6

That is half of his

The other half is he never bothered to compare

7

that gross figure, which was already wrong

8

methodologically, with the demand.

9

wrong in two ways.

10

QUESTIO'*:

So he is patently

Well, did his use of the average

11

availability figures in effect get used twice, once in

12

the supply figures and once in the excused nonuse

13

calculations?

14

MR. SIMMS:

Well,

what he did to determine the

15

demand on the river in effect was to equate the short

16

supply — that is what you see in his Table 2 — with

17

the acreage that was irrigated with that supply.

18

that kind of logic or that kind of reasoning precludes a

19

determination of water shortage.

20

To know water shortage you have tc know the

21

difference between the supply and the full demand.

22

refused to look at the full demand.

23

New

He

The reason he did that was because Colorado

24

knew in the beginning that the only way they could even

25

argue that there would be no injury to New Mexico in

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) «28-0300

1

this case is to cut the water users in half to begin

2

with and leave all cf that injury behind.

3

the Special «aster’s Report recommends to this Court.

4

That is what

There is nearly 4,000 acres that is just

5

pushed aside to begin with because the Master never

6

bothered to lock or compare supply and demand.

7

QUESTION*

But the Master has found that New

8

Mexico’s administration of its water decrease was much

9

looser than Colorado’s.

Certainly the intimation from

10

those findings is that New Mexico could do a much better

11

job of conserving and make better use cf the water that

12

it get s .

13

HR. SIMMS*

That Easter, Justice Rehnguist,

14

did not point to one way in which administration would

15

be able to save water in New Mexico, and I would suggest

He has not told us how administration would

What Colorado did was to put on the testimony
of his state engineer and then elicit from our state

10

engineer the fact that there is presently no water

12

argumentatively in briefs Colorado tried to explain as

13

they managed to presuade the Master that some kind of

administration would make it possible to conserve

16

QUESTIONS

You say that since the Master's

finding does not meaning anything he should not only

18

find that the New Mexico decree is loosely administered

19

but be able to point out how tighter administration

20

would

21

somehow save water.
ME. SIMMS;

Most certainly.

First of all, it

22

is not loosely administered .

23

along any one of the lines that Colorado has suggested,

HR. WELBCPNs

No, there is no suggestion of

cleaning up the canals.

basic -- it is basically its average usage — is

point.

Justice Rehnquist, that the figures that the

Special Master set forth in his report in his additional

findings as to the amount of water coming to the

22

District from other sources were about 45 percent.

23

water from the Chico Ricco and

So the water that the District gets from the

2

Vermejo is only a little over half of its total supply.

3

Those other sources, of course, would not be affected in

4

any way by the Colorado diversion, but I wanted to

5

suggest this again that the diverters on the Vermejo

6

other than the District would not be affected even in a

monthly figures at the Dawson gauge even in the low flow

QUESTIONS

Mr. Welborn, why did the Master

12

refuse to admit into evidence recent USGS stream flow

14

the available water?
MR. WELBORN:

15

Well, I suggest that the Special

17

and cumulative in a way of minor significance.

10

one measurement was made as shown by a Hew Eexico

exhibit, A-130, the seepage run on the Vermejo had shown

12

the Phelps Dodge lessee irrigating after what New

13

Mexico’s own exhibit had said was the irriaation season,

14

after September 15th, and using an amount of water, 300

15

acre-feet, which would have been equivalent to the total

annual entitlement of that diverter.

17

So this is the sort cf thing that could have

been dealt with and would have been dealt with by proper

administration certainly in Colorado.

factors, I suggest, are ones that the Special Easter

took into account.

our contention that there will be no harm to New Mexico

But if there should be, the Special Master

eminently concluded that any such harm would be

outweighed by these benefits to Colorado, and that, we

feel,

that Colorado should have 4,000 acre-feet of water a

So we suggested that there be that limitation that

There is an extremely important

point with regard to this 2,000 acre-feet that Colorado

very critical points.
