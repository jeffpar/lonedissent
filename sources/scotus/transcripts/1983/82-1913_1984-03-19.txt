ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. OLSON:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and

may it

whether the national uniform wage and hour protections

13

afforded by the Fair Labor Stanards Act are available to

14

employees of publicly owned transportation systems.

15

These protections are an otherwise indisputably

16

legitimate exercise by Congress of authority expressly

17

delegated to it to regulate commerce by Article I of the

18

Constitution.

19

please the Court.

The issue in this case is

Beginning in 1966, the Fair Labor Standards

20

Act was extended by Congress in stages to employees of

21

publicly owned mass transit systems.

22

Metropolitan Transit Authority and the American Public

Transit Association challenged the applicability of the

wage and hour protections in the Western District of

On appeal,

The District Court, notwithstanding that

Mr. Olson, we remanded on that

cf course, but isn't there a distinction in that

the Long Island case was a railroad that was part of the

8

interstate rail system from the time it was established

up to the time of the decision of this Court?

I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that

constitutional significance.

The

There isn't any

The function was the same.
History cannot be cited to support transit as

20

a traditional local governmental function.

In fact,

21

appellee's notion of a tradition would seem to include

22

anything developed during the last 20 years.

23

have never historically considered it necessary to their

24

survival as sovereign entities to operate transportation

25

enterprises, much less to operate such systems

But states

completely free of involvement by the national

2

government on matters of national concern.

3

Municipalities, except in isolated

4

circumstances, did not even enter the field for the

5

first three-fourths of our nation's history.

6

in Helvering versus Powers, this Court unanimously

7

agree! with the Solicitor General that it was no part of

8

the essential governmental functions of a state to

9

furnish transportation to its people.

In 1934,

The Court

10

characterized Boston's operation of a mass transit

11

system, a street railway, as a departure from usual

12

governmental functions, a business enterprise, and in

13

the same category as the sale of liquor.

14

Thus, 50 years ago transit systems were not

15

traditional governmental functions.

16

considered governmental functions at all.

QUESTIONS

They were not

You are not suggesting that a

transit system is analogous to a liquor store, are you?
HR. OLSON:

The transit system is analogous to

20

a liquor store according to the Supreme Court's decision

21

in Helvering versus Powers 50 years ago.

22

QUESTION:

Exactly, but 50 years ago streets

23

were maintained by cities to enable people to be

24

transported from one place to another, and

25

analogize that at all to the mass transit systems that

The state has

9

The reference to the liquor industry was a

10

reference to the South Carolina decision of about 30

11

years prior to the Powers case in which South Carolina

12

had regarded it as a part of the function of their

13

activities to take over the liquor industry in the

14

state.

15

operate the roads is no different today than it was in

18

1934, so there is no constitutionally based significant

17

difference between 1934 and today which ought to change

18

the situation with respect to transit systems.

19

The fact that the states and the municipalities

I don’t quite place San Antonio,

but it is somewhere near the -- at least the last time I

21

was there, somewhere near the center of Texas, isn’t it?

22

HR. OLSON;

23

QUESTION;

24
25

Yes,

it is.

Now, how does that link up with the

interstate rail system?
HR. OLSON:

It does not link up with the

interstate rail system, but Congress has determined that

2

transit systems in the cities have a significant impact

3

on commerce in a variety of ways.

first articulated by Congress when the Fair Labor

5

Standards Act was adopted in 1938 in general terms, in

6

terms of the effect of various different enterprises on

commerce itself.

These findings were

And then as Congress determined to extend the
application of the Fair Labor Standards Act in this

10

area,

effect of a transit system and the employment of the

12

workers in the transit system on commerce.

13

Congress made various findings with respect to the

'So, unless this Court is prepared to enter

14

into an inquiry concerning whether or not the Fair Labor

15

Standards Act is a proper exercise by Congress of its

16

authority under the commerce power, I submit that there

17

should not be different constitutional distinctions

18

between types of exercises of the commerce power.

19

The railroad system is not unlike the railroad

20

system in the Long Island Railroad, which may have

21

linked up with the national railroad system, nonetheless

22

was principally engaged in the business of carrying

23

commuters from the suburbs to the city and back, so the

24

system functionally is not any different than what we

25

are looking at in San Antonio.

1

Now, since 1934, there have bean some changes

2

as far as transit systems are concerned.

3

largec municipalities have taken ever the private sector

activity in the transit field since that time.

only 2 percent of transit systems were publicly owned.

is a recent development.
QUESTION;

11

I suppose that has occurred

12

primarily because the private sector can't operate a lot

13

of these systems at a profit.

14

16

had to step in because of the economic inefficiencies of

16

the systems?

17

MR. OLSON;

Is that right?

The

Well, that is the assertion, and

18

it is very difficult to prove that one way or the other,

19

Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION;

20

In that regard, if that is true,

21

would you say that it is traditional that local

22

government steps in to meet needs of residents of the

23

local community which can't be met by the private

24

sector?

26

MR. OLSON;

I don’t think that the analogy

time that this transition became a very significant

4

factor, the federal government, the Congress of the

5

United States enacted the UMTS, the Act that I mentioned

6

previously, which provided vast federal subsidies to

7

support the acquisition and operation by the local

8

governments of those transit systems.

9

The reason that the states went into
The fact is that about the

So, to the extent that it might be said that

10

transit systems couldn't be operated or couldn't be

11

operated at a profit by the private sector, it was

12

aparently true that it couldn't be operated by the local

13

governmental sector either.

14

jump to take that facet of the fact of taking over the

15

operation by the local government entities to assume

16

that it has then become a traditional governmental

17

function.
QUESTIONS

So it is not an appropriate

Well, I suppose you would, though,

19

concede that it is traditional that government would

20

step in to provide things for people that they can’t

provide for themselves within the community.
MR. OLSON*

22

Government has done that

23

sometimes.

24

everything that people cannot provide for themselves.

25

Government doesn't necessarily provide

Well, of course not, but it

MR. GISONi

It has been asserted as a basis

with that as a generalization.

MR. OLSONi

11

It is conceivable that it could.

12

I hesitate to say that it could not.

But I would

The benchmark that this Court has always

firmly to be guided by historical reality and the

2

relative allocation of powers, and when the state

3

governments enter into something because they choose to

4

operate it as an activity which they decide is something

5

that they would like to provide for their citizens,

6

that, in my judgment, and I believe — we submit to the

7

Court it should not be the Court’s judgment — could

8

cause something to become -- something that can be
handled by the private sector suddenly to become a

traditional governmental activity, something that is

necessary for the states to perform in order to be

QUESTION;

Mr. Olson, I am sure you would

agree that mass transit is a governmental function.
MR. OLSON;

I would agree only in the sense

that some -- and today a substantial number of the mass

transit systems in this country are performed by

governmental entities.

performed by private industry.

MR. OLSON;

In that sense, they are
There are many that are still

Not many relatively speaking, but

add that the briefs reflect the fact that in certain

3

cases the cities contract out this function to private

enterprises to perform the service for them.

MR. OLSON;

But let me ask you this.

Would the

federal government consider it a federal function to

10

operate mass transit in cities that said, we expect you

11

to do it.

12
13

You claim it is a federal function.
MR. OLSON;

The federal government today is

not claiming that it is a federal function.

14

QUESTION;

16

MR. OLSON;

Whose function is it?
It is not necessarily a municipal

16

governmental function.

function.

18

more than an oil utility or an electric power utility

19

might be necessarily vested in one place in the spectrum

20

of who can perform functions or not.

21

terms of the Tenth Amendment, as I understand this

22

Court’s decisions, of what is governmental versus what

23

is — and governmental in the sense of what it takes to

24

be a sovereign entity.

25

It is not necessarily a federal

It is not necessarily a private function, any

We are talking in

We submit that it doesn't require in order for

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

a state to retain sovereignty to operate the activity of

2

transporting people from one place to the other,

3

might say that the decision of this Court two years ago

4

in the Long Island Pailrcad case substantially and

5

overwhelmingly supports that proposition.

6

and T

The Court again considered virtually the same

7

question it considered 50 years before in Helvering

8

versus Powers, and almost in the words of the Court

9

itself, whether — that question was whether a publicly

10

owned transportation system was immune from federal

11

regula ticn.

12

Once again, and once again without dissent,

13

the Court determined that the commuter system there was

14

not an integral part of traditional state activities

15

generally immune from federal regulation under National

16

League of Cities.

17

QUESTION:

Eut was there not some considerable

18

emphasis on the interstate aspects of that line,

19

was linked up on both ends with the national railroad

20

system ?

21

MR. OLSON:

that it

Well, there was some emphasis in

22

the Court's decision after the Court considered, most

23

importantly, and I submit it appears from the Court's

24

decision most importantly, the historical analysis to

25

compare the respective functions of states versus

federal governments and what is truly governmental, and

2

looking back into the history, the Court first of all

3

consiiered

that.
Then, we submit,

4

the Court entered into a

5

functional analysis, or the case appears to suggest

6

that,

7

remember, this was primarily an activity designed to

8

move people from one part of the city to the other.

9

transit systems link up in interstate commerce.

to determine whether the movement of people — and

The

10

They move into Virginia.

So, the transit systems are very much a part

15
16

of tha interstate commerce system, and not functionally

or constitutionally distinguishable from the Long Island

was acquired by the local government, what was

a private enterprise for a substantial number of years,

24

well over 100 years.

MR. OLSON

Well, regulated by the federal

2

government.

3

third part of the Court ’s opinion in the Long Island

4

Railroad case.

5

important -- in order to escape the force of the logic

6

of that decision, the appellees have landed on the fact

7

that, and emphasized the fact that railroads,

8

particularly the Long Island Railroad, have a long

9

history of very specific federal regulation of

10
11

That, the Court went on to that in the

However, I think, that that raises a very

railro ads.
And they seize upon the Court's opinion which

12

contained the language that there is no justification

13

for a rule which would allow the states by acquiring

14

functions previously performed by the private sector to

15

erode federal authority in areas traditionally subject

16

to federal statutory regulation.

17

It is not true that the federal government has

18

not regulated transit systems, but certainly we do not

19

believe that the Court was adopting a proposition that

20

would suggest because only if there is a long antecedent

21

history of specific federal regulation of a subject will

22

it not be preempted by the Tenth Amendment.

23

sort of a use it or lose it theory whereby if the

24

federal government doesn't regulate a particular

25

activity, it might lose the power to do it under the

Tenth Amendment

2

And I submit that would require rewriting the

3

Tenth Amendment to read, "the powers not exercised by

4

the United States are reserved to the states," as

5

opposed to "the powers not delegaei to the United

6

States,"

7

the United States,

8

less up to its limits.

The power to regulate commerce is delegated to
It may have been exercised more or
It may have been more close to

the limits in the railroad situation than it ever has
10

been in the transit system.
But the Tenth Amendment does not say that in

11
12

order to preserve the power of the federal government

13

over commerce it first must exercise that authority.

14

fact,

15

heart of the Court's decisions in this area accords with

16

reality.

17

first time in the Planters Bank case in 1824, when he

18

said that when the government becomes a partner in a

1

trading company, it divests itself so far as concerns

20

the transaction of that company of its sovereign

21

character, and takes that of a private citizen.

22

In

the functional analysis that we believe is at the

Chief Justice Marshall may have said it the

Appellees urge a new approach on the Court.

23

They say that transportation is a service which the

24

private sector can no longer provide, and that a

25

transportation system is vital to citizens, and

17
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

therefore it is an essential governmental function.

2

It is true that public authorities have

3

unquestionably fostered a dependency in most large

4

cities on government-subsidized transportation.

5

not be surprising that the private sector cannot provide

6

or may not be able to provide alternatives to urban mass

7

transit as operated by the states and the cities now,

8

because the states and the cities, using federal funds,

9

and using state funds, are operating those systems at 25

It may

to 40 percent of the operating revenues.

11

operating them at a deficit, and in a sense they have

They are

2

precluded the development in that area of private sector

3

altern atives.

4

We submit that if that logic is followed to

5

its logical conclusion, the states would be able to tike

6

over utilities, the supplying of food, the supplying of

7

gasoline.

8

the providing of commuter railroad service is not a

2

traditional governmental function because at that time

3

there were only two such systems in the United States.

4

There were

5

15 others which were all operated.
In addition, I think it is striking that when

6

you read your cases or reread your cases, U.S. Parden,

7

for example, Parden case, the one thing this Court has

8

made clear is that when you are dealing with a railroad
system, that there — which is part of a national

10

system, that there the power of the Congress is supreme,

11

and you do not cut it off, and I would just urge you to
*

12

compare the decision in the Parden case with the

13

decision in the Missouri employment case,

14

because you were dealing with providing -- workers who

15

provided health and welfare services, you there said the

16

rule that you apply in railroad cases was not

17

applicable, and it seems to me that under those

18

circum stances, Long Island Railroad clearly does not

1

cover this situation.
QUESTION;

20

where there,

Mr. Coleman, was it in Long Island

21

that the Court said that in determining what is a

22

traditional function, we do not use a static concept or

23

approa ch?

24
25

MR. COLEMAN;

That's right.

It says it is not

dependent just upon history, that something at one time

30
ALDER30N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 6204300

1

could have been not pervasively in the public sector, as

2

I assume the transit company in Boston in 1534, which

3

had gone bankrupt, and to get it back on its feet, to

4

put it back in the private sector aoain, they had the

5

city being the trustee, but that was the only one that

6

existed at that time.

7

8
9

QUESTION*

But did the Court use the words

"static concept?"
MR. COLEMAN*

It said it could not — Mr.

10

Chief Justice Burger clearly said it was not a static

11

historical concept.

12

the time you made the decision.

13

that by 1965 and even before that, that transit, mass

14

transit was an essential local governmental function.

15

Now, the other argument that the government

16

makes is that somehow because in part federal funding

17

helped the city to move from a system where you had

18

local privately owned and operated systems but regulated

19

locally and privately to one today where just about

20

every city is owned and operated by the public, that if

21

that is so, then it cannot become traditional within the

22

meaning of National League.

23

It was one that you looked at at
And here it is clear

This just has to be simply wrong.

I just urge

24

you to look at the situation with respect to public

25

hospitals, which clearly are traditional.

It is clear

31
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 620-9300

1

today, for example, that only 36 percent of the

2

hospitals are actually gcvernmentally owned, even though

3

you count all the federal hospitals.

4

It is also clear that through the Hill-Burton

5

money and through Medicare and Medicaid, that the

6

federal government has given much more support to the

7

public hospitals than they have given to local mass

8

transit, yet everyone here concedes, and I hope the

9

government still does, that public hospitals would be a

10
11

traditional governmental function.
I think when you turn to sanitation that the

12

whole industry was revolutionized from private septic

13

tanks to waste water treatment facilities beginning in

14

the 1970’s, and the federal government put up $33

15

billion in federal funding, more than twice the total

16

federal funding of transit.

17

that sanitation is performed by the government and is a

18

local traditional function.

Once again, everyone agrees

19

But I think the government is especially wrong

20

in basing its argument on UMTA funding in a mass transit

21

case, since this Court declared in Jackson Transit that

22

UMTA was not intended by Congress to impose federal

23

labor laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act on local

24

government that has additional federal funding.

25

QUESTION*

Mr. Coleman, what if the government

32
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

simply provided as a condition of getting the federal

3

with the Fair Labor Standards Ret?

11

have to segregate on the basis of sex on the buses.

12

would say that that would be an unconstitutional

13

condition.

14

your rights under the Tenth Amendment, I don't think any

15

court has decided.

16

I

Whether this one would be, where you give up

But the one thing is clear in all the cases,

17

that here the government did not do that.

18

Justice Blackmun, in his opinion in Jackson Transit,

19

goes through the legislative history and demonstrates

20

that the federal government did not make that intention ,

21

in addition, and therefore that brings into play the

22

Pennhurst case, where you said that you cannot claim

23

that the government has imposed a condition unless it is

24

specifically set forth in the statute.

25

In fact, Mr.

Now, in this case, interestingly enough, it

33

AL0ER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

has been set forth just the opposite.

2

Section 5(c) of the UMTA Act, you will — it says that

3

the fact that you take this money is rot to impose any

4

conditions on you as to how you operate your system with

5

respect to your employees other than those things

6

specifically set forth in the statute, and this is not

7

one of the things specifically set forth.

8

If you read

I also would like to call your attention to
Justice O'Connor’s opinion in dissent where she had

10

three others in the recent Dixon case where, Your Honor,

11

you made it clear that where the federal government

12

establishes a program where it makes grants to the local

13

community,

14

is not required to do is to give up its autonomy unless

15

that was the condition of the grant, and in this case

16

there is no provision that that was a condition of the

17

grant.

18

that the one thing that the local community

Now, the third fallacy of the government is

19

that local transit can be distinguished from the

20

activities expressly protected in National League

21

because the government wrongly says Congress singled

22

out, and this is at Page 20 of their brief, public

23

transit for fair labor standards coverage to prevent

24

unfair competition with the private sector.

25

Now, actually, the government fails to tell

amendment, which is Section 102(a) brought within the

3

4

institutions as well as transit.

5

government's partial quote from the 1960 House and

6

Senate Report is misleading, for as shown by the full

quotation, which is on Page 39 of SAMTA's brief,

Also, obviously, you plan the work for every

the government will concede that over 80 percent of the

that under the Constitution they can't be covered.

15

Under those circumstances, the only way you could save

the Act even if you would carve out an exception for

time held that there was no Tenth Amendment argument.

There Congress felt that they could apply it to every

reversed Maryland versus Wirtz, and says that can't be

It seems to me that even though you would try

to find some argument where you could carve out mass

responsible thing to do would be to knock out the whole

Mr. Coleman has primarily based his argument

There are many things in this life that are

to move you from your home to your work and back again.

6

It is fine for the government to do that, and

7

the federal government has assisted that.

We believe

8

that the federal standards of commerce —this is a

regulation of commerce — should be applied.
Mr. Coleman suggests that none of these

10
11

transit systems make a profit.

12

and two years ago in the Long Island Railroad case this

13

Court said in Footnote 11, "There is certainly no

14

question that a state's operation of a common carrier,

15

even without profit and as a public function, would be
