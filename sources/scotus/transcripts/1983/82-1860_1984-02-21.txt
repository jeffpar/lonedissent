ON

BEHALF OF SCHNEIDER MOVING AND STORAGE COMPANY
MR. YATES:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, the cases before the Court today,

11

which are consolidated, arise cut of a collective

12

bargaining relationship.

13

independent moving companies located in St. Louis,

14

Missou ri.

Schneider and Prosser are two

Over a number of years, they entered into a

15
16

series of collective bargaining agreements with a

teamster’s local in St. Louis.

contributions to the respondent trustee funds on behalf

1

I would like to emphasize at the cutset that

2

this particular dispute arises out of the terms of the

3

collective bargaining agreements.

4

the interpretation or construction of statutory rights.

5

In the collective bargaining agreements, Schneider and

6

Prosser and the unions expressly reserved to themselves

7

the right tc resolve differences regarding the meaning

8

or application of the agreements through the grievance

9

and arbitration procedure in the contracts.

It does not involve

They did

10

not provide the trustees would have the right to resclve

11

these questions of coverage, as they are referred tc, in

12

litigation in federal court.
QUESTION :

13

I will address —

What if the collective bargaining

14

agreement says there will be a

15

certain words in describing the coverage, and then there

is a trust agreement, and it uses the same words about

HR. YATESs

With respect tc the collective

bargaining agreement, if the employer and the union have

reserved to themselves the right to resolve the coverage

of the contract.

the trustees of the funds would have the right to

Well, what is the case in this —

In this situation, the collective

17

QUESTIONS

18

MR. YATESs

Yes.
The trust agreements, on the other

19

hand, conditioned eligibility for benefits on employees

20

for whom contributions were required under the

21

collective bargaining agreement, so it goes back tc what

22

the collective bargaining agreement expressly provides.

23

QUESTIONS

But it is just as though the trust

24

agreement had used the very same language as the

25

collective bargaining agreement.

MR. YATES;

1

Correct.

It is our position that

2

in effect the trustees have said, we will be bound by

3

the terms of the collective bargaining agreement with

4

respect to the employer’s obligation tc make

5

contributions.
QUESTION;

6

Mr. Yates, in this particular case

7

involving the Schneider company, as I understand it, the

8

union was decertified -MR. YATES;

9

QUESTION!

10

That’s correct.
-- at the time the District Court

11

dismissed.

Now, in that situation, the union wouldn’t

12

be available for any arbitration, apparently.

MR. YATES;

15

around.

17

is a fairly recent decision, and Republic versus Maddox,

19

tc handle this matter through the grievance and

20

arbitration procedure would continue beyond the

21

expiration of the contract.

23

At the point in time when this
’79, the union was

It still is around today.

QUESTION;

And under the

I believe that's fairly

May I ask you another question?

If

24

you were correct in your position that there is some

25

duty to arbitrate, does the union have a right if it got

1

into a dispute with the employer about what employees

2

were covered and what contributions had to be made, does

3

the union have the right to waive the payment of some of

4

those moneys, to enter into an agreement seme way during

5

the course of the collective bargaining period, saying,

6

well,

7

give up the right to the payment of some particular

8

moneys ?

we understand there is a dispute, we will just

MR. YATES;

9

I believe they do, provided they

10

do it openly and not in a sinister fashion, and I would

11

like to take it back to these -QUESTION;

13

mean,

Is there any authority for that?

I

what dc you rely cn?
MR. YATES;

Ckay.

I am relying on their

15

status as the statutory exclusive bargaining

16

representative.

17

agreement is first negotiated, the union at that time is

18

doing precisely what you are addressing now.

19

at that time is deciding with the employer through

20

collective bargaining hew tc divide the employer's

21

financial pot.

22

that the employer would make contributions tc the funds

23

on behalf of only regular employees, and net on behalf

24

of ether non-regular employees.

saying, we are waiving, if you may, our claim that the

2

employer should make ccntritutions on behalf of -QUESTION*

3

Well,

they obviously have the right

4

to enter into the collective bargaining agreement in the

S

first instance.

6

MR. YATES:

7

QUESTION*

Yes.
But really the question is then, is

8

that fixed, so to speak, because of the interplay with

9

ERISA,

and so the union can’t tinker around with it

10

after that, or waive seme portion of the claim, or

11

something like that.
QUESTION :

12

I believe that there are some

13

distinctions that could be irade, and the clearest

14

distinction would be between vested pension benefits of

15

employees which cannct te tinkered with.

16

is fairly clear there, that if the union or the employer

17

attempt to tinker with vested pension benefits, then I

18

think

I think EFISA

they are interfering with ERISA’s statutory rights.
But here we are not talking about employee

19
20

benefits.

21

what is the measure of the employer’s obligation to make

22

contributions to the fund?

23

employee benefits is reserved exclusively to the

24

trustees.

25

We are talking atcut the funding obligaticn,

The determination of

That is up to them to decide.
Here, the employer and the union thought they

1

had a

fixed agreement as to what the measure of the

2

funding obligation would be.

3

history, the issue never arose as to whether the

4

5

conducted an audit.

were non-regular employees.

must be contributions made on behalf of -- on account of

2

that employee.
MR. YATES;

3

I believe that once again there is

4

a distinction between the funding obligation and the

5

determination of employee benefits, and I believe it is

6

within the discretion of the trustees to say that they

7

will continue to provide benefits for an employee even

8

if the union and the employer agree that contributions
will net be made for that employee, just as in Kaiser

10

the measure of the funding obligation was the number of

11

tons of non-union coal produced.

12

It is simply a measure of — upon the plan.

13

QUESTION;

Sc you could end up with a

14

situation in which the union and the company would agree

15

that we don’t have to make contributions on behalf of

16

Employees A, B, and C, but yet the trustees might be

17

convinced they had a duty to pay pensions to those

18

employ ees.

1

ME. YATES;

That’s correct.

Now, it’s very

20

likely that the pension fund or the health and welfare

21

fund might say, we will not permit participation or that

22

basis, and that is within their right, too.

23

employer and the union must strike a bargain which the

24

trustees then accept, tut once having accepted it,

25

are bound by that bargain.

first place.
QUESTION:

3

Nay I ask just one other question?

4

Does the company have the right to have the issue

5

arbitr ated ?
MR. YATES:

6

Under this contract, the contract

7

did not expressly provide that the company has the right

8

to submit grievances to arbitration.
QUESTION:

9
10

That's correct.

The procedures I read, it has to be

initiated by the employee, and then go through the -MR. YATES:

11

That's correct.

That raises a

12

question which troubled the court below, and that is,

13

can the trustees submit a claim to the grievance and

14

arbitration procedure under this contract?

15

submitted that the trustees in this situation raised the

16

issue and are standing in the shoes cf exactly the

appears -- it would seem that the trustees, if they are

20

acting at the partial or — I'm sorry, the part-time

21

employees' behest is -- are in fact standing in their

shoes.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Mr. Robinette.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES W. BCBINETTF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF CF PROSSER'S MOVING AND STORAGE COMPANY
MR. BOBINETTE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19

please the Court, the rule cf the Eighth Circuit has

20

adopted a position of a presumption against arbitration,

21

and allows the trustees tc independently sue the

22

employer and litigation the meaning and the intent cf

23

the collective bargaining agreement.

24
25

Further, it is tc the exclusion cf the unicn,
and will not be binding on the union nor its

12

440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-8900

1

membership.

The effects on the typical labor management

2

relationships as a result of this rule seem obvious.

3

First of all, it violates the intents of the parties to

4

the collective bargaining agreement, the union and the

5

employer.
Secondly, it invades the traditional province

6
7

of the union and the employer to collectively bargain

8

and settle their disputes as to what the meaning of that

9

collective bargaining agreement is.
Third, it subjects the employer to

10
11

inconsistent obligations, and possibly very heavy

12

expenses for having to litigate this particular issue in

13

a multiplicity of forums, and last but not least, it

14

serves a disservice to the judiciary by forcing the

15

courts to hear traditional labor disputes which are well

16

suited for an arbitrator to decide, and which

17

additionally are neither binding on the co-signatories

18

to the collective bargaining agreement, the union in

19

this particular case.
QUESTION*

20

Mr. Bobinette, in these particular

21

cases,

it appeared that both the collective bargaining

22

agreement and the trust indenture referred to a right of

23

the trustees to file suit for purposes of enforcing the

24

collection proceedings and so forth.

25

different than if the agreements had provided, perhaps,

That is a little

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0200

1

that arbitration was required, and they are silent cn

2

that.

Dees that make a difference?
MR. BOBINETTE;

3

Well, it comes down to a

4

question of determining what the intents of the parties

5

are.

6

as the wishes and the desires of the settlers to the

7

trust,

8

establishing that particular trust.

9

intents of the union and the employer at the time they

15

suggest the fact that they are specifically not

16

mentioned as parties whe can trigger the arbitration

17

provision is an indication that the parties, the union

18

and the employer, never intended to allow them to

19

involve themselves in interpretive disputes.

20

Circuit, that the trustees have no direct access
That is, they can not flip
I would

Given that, and then comparing it to the

21

language contained within the trust indentures, the

22

language in the trust indentures I believe presupposes

23

that the debt cr the obligation under the collective

24

bargaining agreement is already established, and that

25

really what is being allowed under the trust indenture

14

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

is the right tc collect delinquencies, and nothing ircre

2

than that.
And for that reason, I would suggest that that

3
4

is reasonable to determine, that it was the intent of

6

the parties to the collective bargaining agreement to

6

resolve all interpretive disputes under the — or

7

through the grievance and the arbitration provisions.
These risks that I have mentioned are neither

8
9

mandated nor warranted by the legislative history, ncr

10

by the language or the structure of those federal

11

statutes dealing with the regulation of employee

benef i ts.

13

QUESTIONS

Could I ask you --

14

MR. BOBINETTE;

15

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

Perhaps I misunderstood you.

16

Suppose that the trustees lose this coverage issue in

17

litigating with the employer.

18

MR. BOBINETTE;

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

Do you think that finishes the

20

issue?

Or will the employer have to litigate it in a

21

possible arbitration procedure, tco?
MR. ROBINETTE:

22

It is very well possible.

I

23

think

that by allowing the trustees to litigate

24

independently of the union — We had a motion to add the

25

union in on this case, and we never got to that point.

-- the union to arbitrate, and

4

the union would go in and arbitrate those particular

5

issues if they felt as though the interpretation cf the

7

The basis cn which the Eighth Circuit has made

its decision, this is an interpretation of the intent of

9

Congress to not — to separate the trustees from the

10

dependents of the union.

11

A review of the history, of the legislative history

12

indicates the concerns of Congress were with bribery and

13

extortion and illegal activities.

14

Eighth

15

unicn in good faith would not decide to otherwise

16

arbitrate a meritorious dispute.

17

This is drawn from 302(c)(5).

To the contrary, the

Circuit was concerned with the idea that the

I don't think that the concerns of Congress

18

were the same concerns that the Eighth Circuit had.

19

Specfically, I think the construction is supported by

20

locking at the text cf Section 302(c)(5) and indicating

21

that there is nothing in the conditions for setting up

22

these trusts which in any way indicates that Congress

23

intended to alter the relationship between the union and

been developed by this Court and as enunciated by

7

Congress is still, after all, a matter of contract, and

8

the basic -- the bottom line here is that we never

agreed

tc this.

As a matter of fact, the petitioners in

10

their collective bargaining agreements agreed in the

11

pension and health and welfare articles which are cited

12

in the appendix to allow the parties who founded the

13

trust to appoint trustees and to be bound by the trust

14

agreement that is put together by the trustees.

15

In addition to that, they agreed to be bound

16

by all of the provisions of the trust agreement as part

17

of the collective bargaining agreement.

18

the trust agreement is incorporated by reference into

19

the collective bargaining agreement, and in the trust

agreement itself, as is set forth in the appendix, there

is a specific provision that the trustees have a right

to file suit in court independent of and not to the
