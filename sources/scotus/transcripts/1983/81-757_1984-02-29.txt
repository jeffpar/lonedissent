ME. LEE;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
This lawsuit was brought as a class action by

10
11

parents cf black students attending desegregating public

12

publics in seven states and seeking to represent a

13

nationwide class of several million parents similarly

14

situated.
The relief that they seek is not desegregation

15
16

of a public school nor admission of any child to any

17

school, public or private.

18

that the Internal Revenue Service change its standards

19

for determining the tax exempt status cf private schools

20

which their children neither attend nor seek to attend

21

located in or serving desegregating public school

22

districts.

Rather, they seek an order

The Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this

23
24

action.

They lack standing for two separate reasons,

25

each of which is independently dispositive and each cf

which is squarely based on a holding by this Court

2

will discuss each cf these two holdings separately, and

3

the first is Valley Forge Christian College versus

4

Americans United fer Separatior cf Church and State.

5

I

Valley Forge makes clear that without

6

exception, even in establishment clause cases, there is

7

no standing to sue for the purpose of assuring that the

8

Federal Government faithfully observe a particular

9

plaintiff's view of the requirements of a particular

10

provision of the Constitution.

11

irreduceable minimum requirement of injury in fact must

12

be an injury that is mere narrow in scope than breach of

13

the interest shared by all citizens in assuring that

14

governmenal conduct, such as giving financial aid

17

ineligibility clause or the accounts clause or the

If any exception tc that general principle,

20

which reaches all the way back for 60 years to

21

Frcthingham versus Kellcn, were to be acknowledged, the

22

strongest possible case for an exception existed in

23

Valley Forge itself, because, as stressed by the

24

dissents in that case, one cf the central functions cf

25

the establishment clause is to prevent precisely what

u

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the plaintiffs were alleging in Valley Forge, namely

2

direct governmental aid to religion.

3

The Court very correctly ruled that there is

4

no exception, even for establishment clause cases, and

5

thereby established that Article III has independent

6

constitutional significance of its own and the standing

7

issue is to be considered prior to and independent cf

8

any other constitutional issue whose substance the

9

plaintiffs seek to vindicate.
The ether case whese holding also squarelj

10
11

controls, though for quite different reasons, is Simon

12

versus Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization,

13

whose facts are remarkably similar to the facts of this

14

case.

15

organizations lack standing to challenge the tax exempt

16

status of hospitals which refused fully to service the

17

indigent, and the reason that they lacked standing was

18

because one could only speculate whether the relief that

19

they sought, namely the revocation of the exemptions,

20

would in fact cure the injury on which their standing

21

was based, namely the unavailability of hospital

22

services.

23

Simon held that indigent persons and

The identical defect exists in this case, as

24

even the Court of Appeals recognized.

The Court of

25

Appeals, however, distinguished Simon from this case on

court’s view call for a different, mere relaxed set cf

of this Court’s desegregation decisions, Norwood,

to select from two

In fact, I submit there is no divergence at

The court concluded that three

all and Simon squarely governs for two reasons.

The

10

first is that the notion that for purposes cf

11

determining standing there is any difference between

12

school desegregation cases on the one hand and hospital

13

discrimination cases on the ether, that the weight cf

14

the Article III burden somehow shifts, diminishes or

15

increases according to the nature or importance cf the

16

substantive claim was squarely rejected by this Court

17

and expressly rejected by this Court in Valley Forge,

18

which came down after the Court of Appeals’ decision in

19

this c a se.
Second, even considered in isolation, the

20

21

decisions in Norwood, Gilmore and Green do not establish

22

any doctrinal enclave for standing in desegregation

23

cases.

24

standing principles at all because, as Judge Tamm

25

pointed cut in dissent, they were net standing cases.

Indeed, in cur view they establish very few

6

The defendants in Norwood and Gilmore were the

1

2

State cf Mississippi and the City of Montgomery, the

3

precise governmental bodies that had discriminated

4

against these claimants in prior precise desegregation

5

suits because cf the race cf these plaintiffs, Ncrwccd,

6

Gilmore, and their colleagues.

7

been parties to specific desegregation decrees, the

8

plaintiffs in Norwood and Gilmore brought suit directly

9

against those who had discriminated against them and, as

Having in

both cases

10

the Court observed in Gilmcre, the relief that they

11

sought was directly related to the concrete injury they

12

suffer ed.

13

Here, by contrast, the suit is against the

14

revenue collector and net against the discriminator.
With regard tc the summary affirmance in

15
16

Green,

the standing issue was not squarely presented.

17

This Court’s ruling was only a summary affirmance, and

18

this Court later observed that because the Government

19

and the plaintiffs in that case were in agreement, the

20

Court’s affirmance in Green lacks the precedential

21

weight of a case involving a truly adversary

22

contro v ersy.
QUESTIONi

23

Well, I suppose, however, the Court

24

had to assume standing existed tc have entered the order

25

it did.

So it’s much harder tc explain, I think.

ME. LEE;

1

It is correct. Justice C'Conncr,

2

that any court necessarily holds that there is standing

3

in any decision where it renders a substantive decision

4

on the merits.

5

However, even if you get over the Valley Forge

6

hurdle, which I submit you can't in this instance, which

7

came down after the Court of Appeals' decision, sc that

8

you have to weigh the persuasive merits of a Green

9

decision on the one hand and a Simon on the other, which

10

came down after Green, certainly for reasons set forth

11

in this Court's first Eob Jones decision the Green

12

decision is of less persuasive merit.
QUESTION;

I ask you another question.

with the tax exemption practice several specific

17

sections or at least one section of the Revenue Code,

Now, in your view is it unlawful for the

Internal Revenue Service under any of those sections or

provisions to follow the policy it did on the tax

that the school is discriminating racially?

me.

You say that if the Internal Revenue incorrectly

2

grants a tax exemption to a school that's contributing

3

to white flight, allegedly, and therefore it kind of has

4

an indirect sutsidy, there's nc standing to challenge

5

it.
Supposing it were a direct subsidy and you had

subsidizing the new school.

HE. IEE;

Well, whether it's a difference

non-tax cases, which I will get to, in that, reaching

all the way back tc louisiana versus McAdoc, this Ccurt

QUESTION;

This is a situation,

Well, let me restate it.

Their

18

theory, as I understand, is that the Federal Government

19

is in effect supporting the creation of schools that

20

enable white flight to occur and interfere with their

21

ability to go tc racially integrated schools.

22

say, well, you can't sue the Internal Revenue for

23

granting a tax exemption to support that, for very

24

persuasive reasons.

25

And you

I'm wondering if your argument would also

It is a question, I think, that pushes

it.
I think the first answer is that under Valley

11

12

Forge as I understand it in that particular instance

13

there is no standing to sue.
My second answer is that that is not this

14
15

case,

16

Even if you ignore Valley Forge and you say that these

17

plaintiffs do have a right to a Government that does not

18

grant tax exemptions to racially discriminatory schools

19

or, in our instance, to a Department of HHS that dees

20

not grant any kind of subsidy to racially discriminatory

21

schools, that is net the issue in this case.

22

been the issue, it has never been the issue in this

23

case, and it is not an issue at all since May the 25th

24

of last year.

It has not

The cnly issue in this case is what is the

18

NR. LEE;

It does — as I said a moment age

19

Justice Elackmun, it did present the strongest possible

20

case for an exception to the general principle that had

21

been established in Frcthingham versus Fellcn,

22

Schlesinger, Richardson, and sc forth, in that the

23

establishment clause apart from any ether provision of

24

the Constitution dees, as the dissents in that case

25

noted,

specifically — or one of its central functions

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 026-0300

1

is to guarantee against direct Government aid to

2

religion, so that in the establishment clause context,

3

arguably the Constitution itself creates standing, just

4

like a statute can create standing.
Now, that proposition lost five to four and

5
6

that was a correct decision.
QUESTION*

7

Of course, one can argue, though,

8

that the Court is eroding the religion clauses somewhat

9

with these five to four decisions, isn't it?
ME. LEE*

10

Well, I think the Court is greatly

11

strengthening the Article III principle with its

12

decision in Valley Forge.

13

extent there might be a separate consideration for

14

establishment clause cases, that does net obtain in a

15

case such as this.

Eut in any event, to whatever

Now, the only issue in this case, as I say, is

16
17

not whether there should be tax exemptions for racially

18

discriminatory schools; the only issue is, cut of three

19

possible alternatives -- and sc far as I know, to date

20

there are only three possible alternatives — which is

21

the best of those three alternatives for identifying

22

which

24
25

are the racially discriminatory schools and then

These three alternatives are*

procedure that is now followed, Revenue Procedure 75-50;

1

the 1978 and 1979 regulations; and what the plaintiffs

2

are seeking in this case.

3

which of those is the test approach, as is shown by the

4

difficulty that Congress has had and the Internal

5

Revenue Service has had in selecting among these three

6

approa ches.
What this case really boils down to is an

7
8

It Is not at all apparent

attempt ty these plaintiffs to take the resolution, the
choice among those three policy choices, away from the

10

political branches and secure their first choice of

11

alternative by judicial decree, and that is clearly

12

outside the bounds of standing to sue in a federal

13

court.
Let me make just one final point, and it is

14
15

that this is an income tax case, the standing rules

16

should

17

that ccire before the federal courts, but that there is

18

an extra layer of consideration in income tax cases.

1

Taxpayers do have standing to seek review of their own

20

tax liability and, as occurred in Taxation with

21

Representation last year, they may challenge the tax

22

treatment of ethers where it is relevant to their own

23

claims for consistent treatment.

24

To go beyond

25

apply across the board to all substantive matters

that, we submit, would be both

unprecedented and also unwise.

It would put in the

powerful weapon which would not only distort the

3

adversarial and competitive processes, tut also, ir the

language of this Court in Louisiana versus KcAdoc,

5

"operate tc disturb the whole revenue system of the

6

This does not mean that the revenue laws will

go unenforced.

It just means that the enforcement will

9

be uniform, accomplished by Government, as prescribed

and overseen by Congress, rather than exists as a weapon

What he learned was that Respondents,

tax exempt status of 35C0 ncn-party public schools,

11

including the school that Reverend Allen had founded in

12

Memphis, Tennessee.

13

Although each of these schools professed under

14

penalty of perjury to have an open admissions policy and

15

Respondents had not been denied admission tc any of

16

these schools, Respondents sought a blanket condemnation

17

of all these schools ard revocation of the schools'

18

exemption based upon an irrebuttable presumption of

19

discrimination, primarily as a result of the school's

20

failure to attract its quota of minority students.

Prior to Reverend Allen's intervention, no

party had any interest in the rights of these 35C0

I think the injury, Your Honor,

injury in the case as we see it is the same as the

It's the Government participation in the

basically is that the grant of significant financial

legal equivalent fer equivalent for equal protection

10

Mr. Kapp, if you are correct that

the Government grant of a tax exemption to a school such

as Eriarcrest is equivalent to the Government in effect

operating the school, wouldn't that line of reasoning

14

carry you over to say that if the Government grants a

tax exemption to a church it's tantamount to the

16

Government operating the church and therefore would be

barred

MR. KAPP:

I think there is a well-developed

19

constitutional rule here that derives from Norwood,

20

which says that at least when the Government is

21

providing financial assistance, either in the form of

22

tuition grants or tax exemptions, that that is the legal

equivalent cf operating the school simply for the

purposes of analysis.

considerations with respect to the free exercise clause

Mr. Kapp, suppose there are two

schools in a community, two private schools.

the other one is a private school that everybody agrees

desegregation of the schools, cf these schools that are

17

in the process of desegregating, in terms of that injury

18

what’s the difference between the two schools?

19

MR. KAPP*

The difference between the twe

20

schools, Your Honor, is that in the case of the school

21

that is discriminatory the Government’s providing cf a

22

tax exemption signals official approval of that school,

23

which in turn injures the public school students and --

interfere with the desegregation of the school?

13

Well, certainly, Your Honor, there

is a constitutional right to attend a private school.

15

That’s a well recognized right.

system of segregated schools.
QUESTION:

It sounds like you’re constantly

19

coming back to a variety of the stigma argument.

20

not sayino that's a bad argument, but I’m just wondering

21

if there's anything concretely different between the two

Well, the desegregation process, I

suppose, has tc do more with a lack of Government

would have.

approval of a continuation of a type of the old dual

school system, if you will, the fact that the Government

6

is approving racially identifiable schools, and that

does interfere with the educational process, we contend,

and for the same reason interferes with the

desegregation process.

QUESTION*

you claim were discriminatory schools, if a particular

school suddenly changed its policy in a manner that you

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

MR. KAPP;

1

I think you have to decide each of

2

these cases cn an individual basis.

I do think that in

3

many cases the stigma will interfere, itself interferes

4

with the educational process because it gives the black

5

school children a sense of lesser worth and sc forth.

6

The existence of that stigma occurring in Michigan may

7

not affect somebody who is in California to a degree

8

sufficient to seek standing.
If there are no further questions, Your
