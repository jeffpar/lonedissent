MR. LEVY;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court;
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the

United

States Court cf Appeals for the Second Circuit.

10

The question presented is whether an accountant

11

privilege should be created to shield from the IRS the

12

tax accrual work papers that were prepared by an

13

independent public accountant in connection with his

14

audit cf a publicly held corporat ion pursuant to the

15

federal securities laws.
The Court of Appeals established such a

16
17

privilege and on that basis denied enforcement of the

18

IRS summons for the tax accrual work papers.

19

the first and only occasion that any federal accountant

20

privilege has ever been adopted.

This marks

The background of this case may be briefly

21

22

stated.

The federal securities laws require that

23

publicly held corporations, such as Amerada Hess, file

24

financial statements that have heen audited and

25

certified by an independent certified public

principles, the corporation must accrue as a charge to

earnings a reserve for contingent tax liabilities.

reflects the possibility that the corporation will ewe

more in taxes than it paid.

Under generally accepted accounting

This

In accordance with generally accepted auditing

7

standards, the independent public auditors must

determine the adequacy of this reserve in order to

MR. LEVY;

That's correct, and then it is

wr. Levy, would your position be

HR. LEVY!

Well,

I think that would be a

3

different case.

4

the IRS is entitled to these work papers.

5

would net raise the dimension that this one does about

6

the conflict that the Court of Appeals perceived between

7

the tax laws and the securities laws.

8

there would only be the unfairness rationale of the

9

Court of Appeals to sustain any claim to privilege.

10

Our position would be the same, that

QUESTION*

That case

In that situation

Well, certainly seme of your

11

arguments here would be inapplicable in that situation,

12

I would think.

HP. LEVYs

Well,

I think it's really more that

14

the accounting firm's arguments would be in applicable

15

in that situation.

16

forward and justify the privilege, and one of the

17

grounds that the Court of Appeals relied on in

18

sustaining the privilege here was that to allow the IRS

19

to have access to these papers would in some way

20

undermine the securities laws.

21

a problem in the hypothetical.

Wouldn't some of your arguments be

inapplicable, to wit, the duty owed to the public?

Well, it would be inapplicable in

the sense that we wouldn't need to respond to that

argume nt

essentially the argument would be that there is some

sort of an accountant privilege that shields in-house

6

court would recognize a privilege in those

circum stances.

That's an issue that could be

That's correct.

It was a joint

Mr. Levy, a special agent had shown

Would your case be stronger if he

appeared?
MR. LEVYs

I don't believe cur case would be

1

materially different.

We think the IBS has summons

20

authority to get these work papers in a civil case, in a

21

criminal case, or in a joint investigation.

22

Now, our case would he stronger, and the Court

23

of Appeals recognized that if the IBS were investigating

24

fraud or some other state of mind issue, there would be

25

no privilege for the work papers, and in a criminal

But it could also come up in a civil

We think the Court of Appeals made a

5

fundamental mistake in saying that because the IBS had

not alleged fraud at the time it issued the summons,

was to determine whether there was any basis for

So that would be the difference if there

Well, certainly the appearance cf a

MR. LEVY:

17

Yes, a special agent does

Appeals put great weight on the fact that in that

20

investigation the IRS had not made any allegations cf

But the Court cf

Ke think that was a mistake.

The IRS should

23

have the authority to get these work papers for, among

24

other reasons, to determine whether there’s any basis

25

for an allegation of fraud, and the Government can’t

make that allegation before it conducts its

investigation.
The Court of Appeals* creation of an

3
4

accountant privilege in this case rested cn twc

5

theories*

6

papers would be unfair and prejudicial to the taxpayer;

7

and second, that IRS access would chill candor in

8

communications between the corporation and the

9

independent public auditor, and that this would work to

first, that IRS access to tax accrual work

10

the disadvantage of the investing public and be contrary

11

to the policies of the securities laws.
And me consider each of these theories in

12

13

turn.

Rut even taken together, we think the Court of

14

Appeals took too expansive a view of its role to weigh

15

competing policy considerations againt the Government's

16

entitlement to obtain information pursuant to statute,

17

and that neither of its theories justifies the creation

18

of a novel accountant privilege or overcomes the strong

19

presumption in the law against the establishment of a

20

new privilege.

21

First, the claim of unfairness.

This claim

22

seems to derive from one of three sources, that IRS

23

access here is unfair*

24

the process or the balance of advantage between the

25

taxpayer and the IPS in a tax investigation; or twc,

one, because of something about

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62&-8300

1

because something in the relationship between the

2

corporation and its independent public auditor makes it

3

unfair; or three, that there’s something in the contents

4

of the work papers that makes it unfair for the IBS to

5

summon these.

6

I'll address each of these in turn.

The claim that the process of tax

7

investigation makes it unfair for the IBS to have access

8

must be assessed in the context of our self-reporting

9

tax system.

IBS enforcement of the tax laws serves two

10

basic purposes;

First, it furthers the fundamental

11

government interest in collecting revenues; and second,

12

it achieves equity among taxpayers by ensuring that a

13

taxpayer who fully complies voluntarily is not put at a

14

disadvantage in relation to a less scrupulous taxpayer.

15

New, under cur tax system the taxpayer has an

16

affirmative obligation to pay his fair share of taxes

17

and to compile and to provide to the Government a great

18

deal of information to demonstrate his compliance with

19

the law.

That’s the nature of the tax system.

20

Hhile it is of course often true that the IBS

21

and the taxpayer may have opposing views, the nature of

22

the tax system is not arm’s length or adversarial in the

23

same sense that a system of litigation is.

24
26

QUESTION;

Mr. Levy, hasn’t this Court gone

into this about a thousand times by now, the great

theory of the IRS?
MR. LEVY:

2
3

I believe so, and I believe

everything that’s in my presentation --

4

QUESTION:

Well, do we need it for this case?

5

MR. LEVY:

I think it helps to support the

6

Government’s position here to realize what is at stake

7

in withholding access to these papers from the IRS.

8

QUESTION:

It’s up to you.

9

NR. LEVY:

Well, let me move on from that,

10

It’s your time.

then.
Whatever may be true in the litigation area,

11
12

there is no room in a tax investigation system for a

13

sporting theory of justice that requires that the

14

relative advantages between the taxpayer and the IRS be

15

equalized.

16

event like a horse race or a golf match, in which each

17

of the participants has to bear an equalizing handicap.

A tax investigation is not a competitive

18

The fundamental point here, tc get to it, is

19

that — is whether the tax accrual work papers will be

20

available to help tc ensure that all facts and all

21

issues are brought out into the open sc that the IRS can

22

form a judgment about the taxpayer’s tax liabilities and

23

any issues can be resolved through the processes

24

provided by law.

25

There's no room for the taxpayer to complain,

11
AL0ER8ON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

as Fes pendents do here, that the IRS’ enforcement is toe

2

effective or that the relevant information will he too

3

helpful to the IRS in determining the taxpayer's

4

liabil ity .
QUESTION i

5

Well, it's a question basically of

8

Congressional intent, I suppose, isn't it?

7

how effective did Congress intend these procedures to

8

be, and did Congress perhaps imply that there might be

9

some room for this kind of privilege?
MR. LEVYi

10

You knew,

No one, neither the Court of

11

Appeals nor the Respondents, have identified anything in

12

the Congressional intent that would support a privilege

13

on this branch of the case.

14

fundamental fairness they claim.
QUFSTIONi

15

It is rather a point cf

Well, what reason, then, do you

16

think that Judge Feinberg thought supported his opinion

17

if it

18

weren’t some implicit Congressional intent?

»

MR. LEVY;

We think that it was a

19

misconception about the role of the judiciary, that he

20

thought that it was the proper role of the federal

21

judiciary to weigh competing social policies against the

22

statutory access authorized by Congress and conferred on

23

the Service.

24

misapproach to the case.

25

We think that was a fundamental

But at least as to this side of it, on the

12

ALDER30N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

unfair ness argument, he identified nothing in the

2

statut e or any legislative history that would support a

3

privil ege, and we think this Court's opinions point in

4

ex act 1 y the opposite direction, that Congress wanted the

5

IRS to have the broadest possible access and to be able

6

to hav e every helpful and effective means of enforcing

7

the ta x laws.
Now, the claim of unfairness may also rest in

8
9

part n ct on this balance of advantage, but on the idea

10

tha t I PS access will intrude into a sensitive relation

11

betwee n the accountant and the corporation that the law

12

should

We think this is simply not so.

In Couch this Court recognized that there is

no fed eral accountant-client privilege, and thus -QUESTION:

15

Nr. Levy, may I ask you a question

here,

MR. LEVY:

Well, I think that would certainly

HR. IEYY :

And that's why it would raise hard

22

questions about whether the privilege applied in the

first instance, whether he was giving confidential legal

advice on behalf of the client or, even if he were,

25

whether it would be waived in the circumstances of that

case.
I think cur position might be that we were

2
3

entitled to the opinion there, but as I say that raises

4

issues that haven’t been addressed in this case.

5

case only involves an accountant whose duty, whose

6

paramount duty, is to the public, including the

7

Government and investors and creditors as well.
The nature of the advice is also quite

different.

The lawyer in general gives confidential

advice and formulates strategy for the client.

i

Well, are you suggesting that a lot

of accountants, CPA's, do not give legal advice, about

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

tax particularly?
MR. LEVY:

2

I’m saying that when they're acting

3

as an independent public auditor in connection with the

4

securities laws, their obligation is to the public and

5

it is not one of giving confidential advice.
QUESTION

6

i

And you think that function is

7

wound up in both of these kinds of papers that are

8

involved in this case?
\

MR. LEVY*

9

In this case as it comes to the

10

Court there is only one kind of paper that's involved,

11

the tax accrual work papers, and we think it is

12

fundamentally involved in resolving the issue whether

13

the IRS should have access.
QUESTION:

14
15

Even if for other purposes they

give advice about what tax liability is?
NR. LEVY:

16

That would be a different case,

17

although we think Couch recognizes that there is nc

18

general accountant-client privilege.
QUESTION:

19
20

Mr. Levy, what would happen if the

accountant was in a legal office?

21

KR. LEVY:

I'm sorry, Hr. Justice Marshall?

22

QUESTION:

What would happen if the accountant

23

26

was in

MR. LEVY:

If he's performing a role as an

independent public auditor, I don't think that would

I don't believe

His obligation is to the public.
QUESTION;

5

Sc that the lawyer and the

6

accountant advising the client, the lawyer is privileged

7

but the accountant is.nct?
NR. LEVY;

8
9

Well, if it's in connection with a

certification of a public financial statement I think

10

there would be questions about whether the lawyer's

11

advice wculd be privileged.

12

involved here, but they touch on the points that Mr.

13

Justice Stevens raised.
QUESTION;

14
15
16

These questions aren't

Yes, that's what got me on this

tangent.
, MR. LEVY;

But there would be difficult

17

questions about whether the privilege applies and, even

18

if it applies, whether it wculd be waived by disclosing

19

it to a quasi-public person.

20

QUESTION;

Well, what wculd — I know this is

21

way out in left field.

22

gave the opinion that the accountant should have given?

23

Would that be privileged?

24
25

MR. LEVY;

What wculd happen if the lawyer

As I say, that would raise

different questions, and some cf those questions are

17

preseated in the El Paso case, in which the Fifth

2

Circuit held that there, at a minimum, was a waiver cf

3

any attorney privilege by disclosing it to the outside

4

aud ito r.

5

But the Court of Appeals nor the Respondents

6

have raised any of those kinds of issues in this case.

7

The accountant privilege here stands on a different

8

footing.

9

QUESTION;

They're not in this case?

10

MR. LEVY;

No, they haven't been raised.

11

This case is really no different than if the

12

securities laws provided that the SEC would select the

13

outside auditor, rather than letting a corporation do

the tax accrual work papers and, more importantly, what

11

is not

12

To understand the issue that is presented

in the tax accrual work papers.
The tax accrual papers are prepared by the

13

auditors and are primarily the auditors’ opinions,

14

judgments, assessments and thought processes in

15

determining whether the provision for taxes shown cn the

16

financial statements of a corporate taxpayer are

17

reasonable.

provided for on the financial statements are exact or

the exact amount of taxes that will eventually be F3id

Government’s position which is sprinkled throughout its

And, contrary to the

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

papers and in the argument today, the facts comprise a

2

very minimal or minor element.

3

As in the attorney work product doctrine, an

4

analogue to which the Second Circuit locked in drafting

5

a carefully crafted exception for tax accrual work

6

papers, the fact that there are some facts incidental to

7

the independent — the lawyer's thought processes, dees

8

not make the materials otherwise discoverable unless

9

there is a particularized need shown.

10

How, the components of the tax accrual are

11

essentially two.

12

disallowances by the IBS and possible overpayments by

13

the taxpayer.

14

the tax accounts we will find that a client has provided

15

too much of a tax reserve and will net pay the taxes

18

that it proposes to pay.

17

It is net infrequent that in a review of

The second component is the evaluation of

18

pending disputes with the IBS, either in the form of

19

existing revenue agent reviews or sometimes in actual

20

litiga ticn .

21

Now, to make these evaluations the auditor

22

must review the corporate records.

I note, it is the

23

same universe of corporate records that are available to

24

the IRS when it conducts its audit, and in this case the

25

IRS agents made over 4CO document requests to Amerada,

28

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

398 of which were complied with, and .Amerada produced

2

close to 45,000 pieces of paper to the IRS and expended

3

some 11,500 person-hours of work prior to the time that

4

the IRS sought enforcement of the summons against Arthur

5

Young £ Company.
The auditor must make a series of judgments on

6
7

worst case scenarios, what could happen, what might

8

happen, what's the likelihood of something happening.
But it is a judgmental process reviewing those facts.

10

It needs to discuss matters with the client's

personnel.

position with respect to that disallowance to determine

14

whether or not the client has provided for a potential

15

tax liability or whether the client intends to fight

it.

17

For example, if there's been a revenue agent

and a disallowance, it needs to know the client's

It is not infrequent that we will find

18

statements in the tax accrual work papers such as, the

21

already be a litigation and we will have counsel's

22

opinion in the tax accrual work papers on the potential

23

outcome of that litigation.

24
25

Similarly, there may

It is not unusual to find statements in there
from counsel to the effect that, although there is a

1

split in the circuits and we believe the client should

2

prevail, we nevertheless recommend that the client

3

settle this matter in the following amount.
The tax accrual papers, therefore, are an

4
5

amalgam of opinions and only incidentally, as I noted,

6

do they contain facts.

7

this is unsupported by the record below.
In addition, contrary to the Government’s

The Government’s speculation on

the totality of the reserve in relationship to all the

14

other accounts on the financial statements for the

Rather, it means that we are trying to evaluate

I think

what in reality the court did, and we may be getting

weighed the competing interests that were necessary.

MR. JACKSON;

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts
I would like to deal further with the issue

10
11

which has already been raised, that is one of the

12

grounds for the opinion and decision of the Second

13

Circuit below, and that is the issue of fundamental

14

fairness.

15

whether it is fair in the administration of the

adversarial process between the taxpayer and the Service

to permit the Service access'tc the private thoughts of

And the issue is, quite simply as I see it,

QUESTION;

20

Mr. Jackson, if we should decide in

21

our subjective judgment that it was net "fair" to dc

22

that, ought we to affirm the judgment of the Court of

23

Appeals?

24
25

MR. JACKSON;

I think yes, Your Honor.

I

think that is one cf the grounds on which that court

41

2

reached its decision.
QUESTIONt

What authority in our past cases is

3

there for that sort of a thing, to just evaluate

4

something in terms of "fairness"?

5

MR. JACKSCNs

I think, Your Honor, this Court

6

has held in a series of cases, the Powell case being

7

one, that an IPS summons will be enforced only under

8

certain conditions.

9

Service is not already in possession of the

10
11

information.

And one condition is that the

That was part of the ruling in Powell.

Here there is no question that the Service is

12

in possession cf practically every piece of paper in

13

Amerada*s hooks and records relating to the factual

14

transactional aspects cf its tax liabilities.

15

therefore there is no need for the Service to seek the

16

tax accrual papers when it has had access to all the

17

great volume of materials which Hr. Liggio mentioned

18

earlier from the taxpayer.

That is,

19

And in Euge, which is a later case, the Court

20

reinforced that aspect of enforcement cf an IPS summons

21

by saying that enforcement must in the case be necessary

22

to the enforcement of the tax laws.

23

access by the Service to the judgmental and private

24

thought papers contained in these tax accrual work

of fraud in this case.

2

And by the way, Ycur Honors, when the summons

3

to Arthur Young was issued whi»ch is here involved this

4

investigation had been under way for a long time.

5

Service had had the records of Amerada Hess and it

6

should have known by that time whether there was any

7

basis to claim fraud or not.
But fraud is not in issue.

8

9

The

Therefore, it is

not essential for the Service to seek for evidence of

10

intent.

11

19, disclaims any interest in the judgmental portions of

12

these papers, which I think is certainly a concession

13

that they are not needed for those purposes.

14

And indeed, the reply brief, I believe at page

And sc, if there is nc need then I say it is

15

unfair to enforce the summons against the taxpayer,

16

against his independent auditor, to compel the

17

revelation of his private thoughts as to his strategies

18

in audit and in litigation.

19

a recent case involving an IBS summons, the Eadgett

20

case, adverted to considerations of fundamental fairness

21

in the context of the enforcement of an IPS summons.

22

QUESTION*

And that's -- this Court in

What if the taxpayer had done his

23

own work and prepared wcrk papers that IBS sought?

24

Would they be somehow protected?

25

HR. JACKSONs

Under this aspect of the Second

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Circuit’s decision, yes. Your Honor, they would be.

2

Under the alternate ground, the additional ground, which

3

is the intrusion upon the independent auditor's

4

function, they would not be under that rationale because

5

they're not independent.
But certainly from the point of view of

6

7

compelling the taxpayer to reveal all in this

8

adversarial process to the IBS while the taxpayer can't

9

get the same information from the IBS, it would be most

10

unfair.

And that was the situation, Your Honor, that

11

was involved, of course, in El Paso, where the papers

12

had been prepared internally.

13

QUESTION*

Well,

I suppose not many taxpayers

14

have ever thought that the proceedings with IBS were

15

necessarily fair, have they?
MR. JACKSON;

16

I will not disagree with that,

17

Your Honor.

But I think that the Service overreaches in

18

this instance by seeking the aid of the court to compel

19

the taxpayer to, and his independent auditor to, reveal

20

his strategies for dealing with an adversary.

46

AL0ER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

the private thoughts of the taxpayer, often informed and

2

assisted by his counsel as veil as his independent

3

auditor, should not be subject to the intrusion of the

4

IRS, and that it would be unfair to do so, because as

5

the Second Circuit found, and I think common experience

6

bears this out, the relationship between the taxpayer

7

and the Service is at heart adversarial.

8

Certainly that is true in the case of a large

9

corporation which is audited automatically, constantly,

10

and the Service — they are constantly having

11

differences over the treatment of certain items, and the

12

Service’s intent is obviously to maximize tax liability,

13

the intent of the taxpayer is to take advantage of all

14

lawful provisions in the tax laws to reduce liability.
Now, I would like to say one word or the

15
16

subject of Congress’ intent, which was raised earlier

17

during

18

area must be found not only in the tax laws and not only

19

in the securities laws, but also in Rule 501 of the

20

Federal Rules of Evidence, which was enacted pursuant to

21

Congressional authority and approved by Congress, and

22

that is the rule which authorizes -- indeed, the

23

legislative history shows invites — the federal courts

24

to develop the law cf privilege under the principles of

25

the common law, on the basis of experience in cases

the argument.

I think Congress’ intent in this

47

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 30001 (308) 620-0300

1

where development of new privileges are warranted.

2

This is a prevision which the Government

3

admits gives the courts the power to develop new

4

privileges, as the Second Circuit did.

S

is that Congress should be the forum to decide this

6

issue before the Court, rather than — that is, the

7

issue cf privilege — rather than the courts.
Well, I submit that is no answer.

However

10

or the other and it will decide in favor of one party or

13

indeed this is what Congress envisioned in Rule 501.

14

This Court will be making the decision, and

20

This Court decided it and held

In short, Your Honors, we think that the

21

position which is taken by the Government here is

22

contrary to the position of the Service itself in its

23

revised guidelines which permit access to the tax

24

accrual work papers only as a last resort, only after

25

all other avenues of factual inquiry have been
