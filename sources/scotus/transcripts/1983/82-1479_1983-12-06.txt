16

The Court of Appeals found that the evidence

17

introduced at the initial bench trial was insufficient

18

to support conviction, and therefore held that the

double jeopardy clause precluded the de novo trial.

20

court ordered that Mr. Lydon be freed from the personal

21

recognizance he was on, that he not be required to

answer any summons for trial, and effectively precluded

trial which he had requested.

KISS SMITH;

1

Yes, Your Honor.

As I indicated

2

before, in Hensley, the Court focused on the fact that

3

incarceration was certain when it found that he was in

4

sufficient .custody for habeas corpus.

5

incarceration is only a possibility contingent upon a

6

finding of guilt by the jury, and a further

7

determination by the jury trial judge that the

8

individual should be incarcerated and not merely

9

subjected to a fine.

Here,

Moreover, unlike the situation in Hensley, the

10

11

federal court’s finding of custody in this situation

12

does very seriously interfere with the Commonwealth’s

13

significant interest in the efficient operation of its

14

two-tier system.

2

condition of that recognizance, and even then, such a

3

determination need not require his incarceration, but

4

merely an increase in terms of the recognizance or the

5

addition of a surety.
If this Court, I would suggest, holds that

6
7

personal recognizance prior to a de novo trial is

8

sufficient to involve the federal court in a state

9

criminal proceeding, it in effect establishes that

10

federal court as a court of interlocutory appeal over

11

pretrial -- denial of pretrial motions in a state

12

criminal proceeding, and this is a situation, I suggest,

13

never contemplated by the Constitution nor Congress in

14

enacting the habeas corpus statute.
Here, Lydon has been granted pretrial review

15

10

by a federal court over a denial of a motion for

17

directed verdict of acquittal,

18

I submit, even more agregious because interlocutory

this Is so even though there, as here, the defendant

2

attempts to couch his claim in terms of double

3

jeopard y.
To permit such collateral review of a state

4
5

court proceeding far exceeds, I suggest, what is

6

permitted within the federal system itself.
Now, I am aware that this Court has granted

7
8

certiorari to review the District of Columbia decision

9

in the Richardson case, but I would suggest that even

10

were this Court to find such interlocutory review

11

permissible within the federal system, that would not

12

control this case, because principles of comity and

13

federalism would have to he addressed, I believe, before

14

the Court could order such review over a state criminal

15

procee ding.
Moreover, a decision permitting interlocutory

claim presented would,
