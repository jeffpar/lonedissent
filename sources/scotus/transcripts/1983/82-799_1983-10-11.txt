ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. CAROLYN CORWIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MS. CORWINs

6

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The question presented by this case is a

8
9

Ns. Corwin, you may

straightforward one.

It is whether Congress intended

10

for union dues or the federal taxpayers to fund the

11

travel expenses and per diem of federal employees who

12

represent their unions in collective bargaining.

13

Federal agencies pay such expenses for their

14

own representatives at collective bargaining sessions.

15

The question here is whether the Respondent, The Federal

16

Labor Relations Authority, correctly concluded that

17

Congress also meant for the agencies to fund the similar

18

expenses of the union representatives to those sessions.
The statute the Court must construe in this

19
20

case is Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act passed

21

by Congress in 1978.

22

framework for the federal labor management relations

23

program.

24
25

Title VII establishes a statutory

That program formerly had been governed by
executive order, and under the executive order program

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the unions bore their own travel expenses and per diem.

2

There was no entitlement under the executive order

3

program to any reimbursement from federal agencies for

4

those expenses.
Title VII sets out a series of detailed

5
6

provisions governing the federal labor relations

7

program.

None of these provisions addresses the subject

8 of travel expenses and per diem.
9

The Authority has cited Section 7131 of the

10

statute, and that section relates to authorization of

11

official time for employee union representatives.

12

Section 7131 Congress went quite far in subsidizing the

13

collective bargaining process in the federal sector by

14

providing for federal payment of the salaries of the

15

employee union negotiators.

16
17

In

The question here is whether the Respondent,
the FLBA, correctly concluded that Congress meant tc go

18 further in subsidizing the collective bargaining process
19

by funding another category of expenses, the travel

20

expenses and per diem of the employee union

21

representa'tives .

22

QUESTION:

Ms. Corwin, in 7131(a) where the

23

statute says that the employee representative, exclusive

24

representative, shall be authorized official time for

25

such purposes, does that mean anything more than that

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

his fe deral salary will be paid during those and he will

2

not ha ve to take leave?

3

MS. CORWIN:

That is the understanding.

The

4

term ” official time" is one that had grown up within the

5

fed era 1 labor relations program under the executive

6

order.

7

It had always been understood to connote

8 paymen t of salary.

Now it also meant that you did net

9

lose t ime in terms of accruing other benefits such as

10

pen sio n rights and sc on, but the basic principle was

11

that o fficial time meant payment of your salary.

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. CORWIN:

Does that mean travel time?
It did not mean travel time under

14

the ex ecutive order program, and we suggest that the

15

term ” official time" as it grew up in the labor

16

relati ons program indicated that you did not have this

17

right to federal reimbursement of your travel time.

18
19

QUESTION:

were o n official business?

20

MS. CORWIN:

21

QUESTION:

22
23
24
25

Did it not at least mean that you

No, it definitely —
You mean they were paying the

employ ee when he was on unofficial business?
MS. CORWIN:

The understanding of official

time w as that the salary was paid -QUESTION:

Recause why?

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MS. CORWIN;

1

There were several reasons that

2

-- Are you referring to the old executive order program

3

at this point?
QUESTION:

4
5

I am referring to the statute we

are construing.
ES. CORWIN:

6

The statute we are construing

7

uses the term "official time" as it was used under the

8

executive order program and that is why —
QUESTION:

9

Well, why do you think Congress

10

would authorize unlimited time for collective bargaining

11

purposes and pay for it?
MS. CORWIN;

12

Well, I think there are several

13 rationales that Congress probably had in mind.

QUESTION:

14
15

Did they say which one they had in

mind?
MS. CORWIN;

16

In the legislative history of the

17

1978 Act you do not have any statement of why it was

18

that Congress concluded — For example, in the House

19

report you do not have any explanation of why they

20

incorporated this.
'What they were in fact doing was extending the

21

22 provisions under the executive order program in which
23

official time had been available up to a particular

24

ceiling.

Now under the executive order program the

25 reasoning had been that it prevented delay.

It was

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

easier to schedule sessions if you gave people some time

2

off and it minimized the individual hardship.

3

QUESTIONS

So I suppose they were paying them

4

either because they considered it official business cr

5

because they thought it was in the public interest to

6

subsidize collective bargaining.
MS. CORWIN:

7

Hell, I think there were several

8

considerations, but the assumption that it was official

9

business was not one of them.

10

Under the executive order

program —

11

QUESTION;

12

MS. CORHINs

How do you know?
The Comptroller General had been

13

asked this question early on in the executive order

14

program .

15

QUESTION:

16

congressional intent?

17

MS. CORHINs

Is he the final interpreter cf

The Comptroller General had been

18

consulted in his capacity as the individual who makes

19

rulings on expenditures of federal funds, and his

20

conclusion was under this executive order program even

21

if an employee was granted official time, that is, even

22

if his salary was paid that did not translate into

23

official business for the federal government, that in

24

essence the employee --

25

QUESTION:

What was the rationale for paying

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the salary?
MS. CORWIN:

2

Well, several rationales were

3

suggested in the various reports underlying the

4

executive order program.
QUESTION:

5
6

Did the Comptroller General say

what it was?
MS. CORWIN:

7
8

One was --

Well, the Comptroller General in

ruling on the official business point suggested that

9 even though it had been stated in the executive order
10

that collective bargaining might be in the public

11

interest, it was nevertheless not equivalent to official

12

business.

13

the reports I am referring to that refer to the grant of

I do not think the Comptroller General cited

14 official time in terms of solving scheduling
15

difficulties and in terms of solving the individual

16

hardships that might arise.
QUESTION:

17

But that was -- They surely must

18

have been concerned with making collective bargaining

19

work.

20

MS. CORWIN:

That is certainly true, and I

21

think that' has always been the case under the federal

22

labor relations program that that clearly was a concern

23

that Congress had in the 1978 Act.

24

that translates into any sort of mandate for

25

reimbursement of all expenses underlying collective

But I do not think

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

bargaining, and I think that is what the Court needs to

2

consider in determining whether Congress without ever

3

making any mention of the subject has authorized these

4

sorts of expenses to be paid.

5

QUESTION*

Well, surely the federal government

6

is doing something with respect to collective bargaining

7

representatives that industry does not do, or does

8

industry do the same thing?
MS. COHWIN*

9

No, this is not the practice in

10

industry.

The examples that were before Congress in

11

1978 did not include any example in which the employer

12

would fund the collective bargaining expenses of the

13

union.

14

QUESTION*

15

MS. CORWIN*

Even by paying salaries?
The only instances in which that

16

occurred would be when the parties had agreed to it

17

through a negotiation of a collective bargaining

18

agreement.
QUESTION*

19

Well, then the government does

20

subsidize the process to an extent that private industry

21

does not.

22

MS. COEWINs

That is so, and in 1978 I think

23

you have a very careful consideration by Congress in

24

determining what it ought to put into this legislation

25

about how far it ought to go in terras of —

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) S2B-0300

QUESTION*

1

2

Ey using that word "official

time”?
KS. CORWIN:

3

Well/ I think the terminology

4

"official time" is what they picked up from the old

5

executive order progam, and I think it is significant

6

that they used that term as opposed to some other term

7

they might have used.

8

consideration in 1978 about how much farther than the

9

executive order program you ought to go and to what

But you have the very careful

10

extent the federal government ought to be subsidizing

11

the collective bargaining process.
In essence what Congress did was to provide

12

13

this subsidy of the salary expenses, but it did not go

14

further.

15

that Congress itself did not intend this sort of

16

requirement and moreoever that it did not intend to

17

delegate any sort of discretion to the Federal Labor

18

Relations Authority to impose that sort of requirement

19

either.

20

Now we think there are numerous indications

I will summarize those points briefly.

First,

21

as I have mentioned there is total silence in the

22

language in legislative history, and that silence occurs

23

in the context of both the existing federal sector

24

practice and the private sector practice in which unions

25

bore their own expenses of collective bargaining.

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Secondly, as I referred in response to Justice

2

White's question the use of the term "official time" is

3

significant.

4

meaning in the context of the federal labor relations

5

program.

6

That is a term that had a particular

Congress picked up that term.
Third, what you have here is the Authority

7 reading into the statute a requirement that has the
8

effect of imposing a monetary liability on the federal

9

government,
and you have that reading in the absence of
*

10

any expression of congressional intent that it meant to

11

go further and to provide this sort of subsidy in

12

addition to what it had provided for in the terms of the

13

statute.
QUESTIONS

14

?Tay I ask you a question right

15

there?

If one draws an analogy to the Labor Relations

16

Board in the private sector, we habitually give a great

17

deal of deference to the agency that administers the

18

statut e.
I am not sure I understand what your position

19
20

is with respect to the degree of deference that should

21

be paid to this agency or what our standard of review

22

is.

23

statutory construction, or do we attach some weight to

24

the fact that this agency was created by Congress and

25

perhaps was authorized to make decisions of this kind?

Do we just approach it as a brand new question of

11

MS. CORWINs

1

Well , I think the general

2

principle that you have set out is one with which we

3

agree that an administrativ e agency normally does

4

deserve deference.

5

consider here.

I think

there are several points to

First, I think ev en if one ga ve the ma ximuit

6
7

deference to the agency in this case it would no t

8

overcome the indications I have suggested the Co ngress

9

simply did not intend to go this far and did not intend

10

the Authority to be able to
QUESTION;

11

12

What i f we were persuaded that the

Congress just never thought of this problem?
MS. CORWINs

13

Well , I think that there are

14

several other points that y ou ought to consider in

15

determining whether deferen ce is due if that is the

16

concern here.

17

suggested concerning what C ongress may have had in mind

18

you ought to consider the p cint about imposition of

19

monetary liability on the f ederal government,

I think in a ddition to the points I have

QUESTION;

20

Will i t not always be true that in

21

the labor 'disputes that thi s agency has jurisdiction

22

that there will always be a potential for imposing costs

23

on the sovereign and, there fore, every time it rules

24

against the government they are not entitled to

25

def ere nee ?

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

MS. CORWIN;

No,

I think, that is not the case

2

because Congress clearly had in mind that the remedies

3

ordered by the Authority would involve things like back

4

pay, and it did inlcude within Title VII a specific

5

reference to the Back Pay Act because it anticipated

6

that this sort of award was going to come up on a

7

regular basis.

8

Back Pay Act, which is outside of Title VII.

9

It referred to the Section 5596, The

Here you do not have any reference to the

10

particular Chapter 57 that relates to travel expenses

11

and per diem so you do not have Congress making the same

12

sort of cross-reference indicating that it acknowledged

13

that there would be some sort of monetary liability.

14

think that is another point that the Authority here felt

15

it necessary to go outside cf the limitations of its own

16

statute, outside of Title VII and to refer to Chapter 57

17

which is not within its responsibility for

18

construction.

19

Administration's realm of authority.

20

I

Father it is within the General Services

I think another point to consider when you are

21

determining the deference that is due here is that this

22

particular statutory scheme is one in which Congress did

23

not leave much in the way of gaps or interstices for the

24

authority to fill.

25

here which was the product cf some very careful

You have quite a detailed blueprint

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) S28-S300

1

consid eration by Congress about how far it ought to go.
It was urged on the one hand to stick with the

2
3

old ex ecutive order program and simply to codify that.

4

On the other hand, it was urged to go much further in

5

the di rection the employee unions wanted it to do.
QUESTION*

6

Ms. Corwin, you have given me the

7

reason s why they should get less deference than agencies

8

often get.

9

think, this agency is entitled to with respect to this

What is the degree of deference that you

10

issue if we conclude that Congress did not think of this

11

par tic ular problem?

12

at all ?

13

MS. CORWIN*

Are they entitled to any deference

I do not think that under the

14

circum stances of this particular case that the Authority

15

ought to receive any deference because of the principle

16

that i n the case of imposition of monetary liability on

17

the fe deral government the presumption of this Court has

18

always been that one does not read that into the statute

19

absent some expression of congressional intent, but I

20

think. even if the Court did determine that there ought

21

to be some deference it is not enough to overcome the

22

indica tions of that principle and other indications that

23

sugges t that Congress did net --

24
25

QUESTION*

But your answer to my question

really is they are not entitled to any deference?

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MS. CORWIN;

1

2

That would be our position under

the circumstances of this particular case.

3

QUESTION;

But in effect they are construing a

4

statute that is committed to the Comptroller General

5

rather than to them.
MS. CORWIN;

6

I think that is one point that

7

they have gone outside of their own statute and that

8

diminishes any deference.

9

they are doing imposes this monetary liability.

I think the point of what
It is

10

something that brings this other principle of statutory

11

construction into play.
QUESTION;

12

I thought you were -- You realy

13

said earlier that you thought the Congress had really

14

addressed it in the sense that it had limited the

15

subsidization to official time and that that is a term

16

of art.

17

MS. CORWIN;

I think that is correct.

In

18

using the term "official time" I think you have to

19

conclude that Congress must have intended it to be

20

official time as it was known to the federal —

21

'QUESTION;

22

MS. CORWIN;

And as though it said and no mere.
Yes, I think this is a statute

23

which Congress considered quite carefully how far to go,

24

and as I was suggesting to Justice Stevens there were

25

people who were urging it to go much further.

There

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

were people who were urging it to do much less than it

2 did, and the result is a rather detailed blueprint of
3

the way Congress wanted this labor relations program to

4

work.

5

There was provision of a certain subsidy, a

6

rather generous subsidy in the form of the salaries, but

7

there was then no further step.

8

QUESTION.-

That is all.

9

QUESTION*

This is somewhat like the rule that

10 if you are on the subject matter and you include one and
11

do not take the other then that is an inference you

12

intended to omit it.

13
14

MS. CORHINj

I think that general principle is

certainly applicable here, but I think in this

15 particular context in this statute you do have rather
16

careful consideration about whether the Congress ought

17

to go further in terms of subsidizing unions and

18 subsidizing collective bargaining.

The fact that they

19

did not take the step in this case I think is

20

particularly significant.

21

T think one has to also consider the fact that

22

the statute reflects the fact that Congress was aware

23

that there was a source of union funds out there that

24

unions would have dues with which they could pay such

25

expenses and with which they had paid the expenses all

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

along.

2

unions would have dues and that Congress was aware cf

3

this,

4

Congress without making any mention at all somehow felt

5

it was appropriate to add on or that the Authority

6

itself ought to go further and add on some sort of

7

financial requirement that would shift the expenses from

8

where they normally would fall and where they always had

9

been to the federal agencies.

It seems to me that given the assumption that

it is even more inappropriate to assume that

Now all of these considerations I have

10
11

mentioned have led all of the Courts of Appeal that have

12

considered the issue other than the court below to

13

conclude that the Authority exceeded its statutory

14

discretion, exceeded its statutory authority in this

15

case,

16

on these considerations I have suggested.

17

and we think, that is the proper conclusion based

Now I would like to briefly turn to the

18

alternative argument that the Authority and Respondent,

19

NTEU, have put forward and that is the argunent that

20

collective bargaining is somehow equivalent to be

21

on-the-job or on-duty status and that that in turn leads

22

to the conclusion that there is official business here

23

and then you in turn reach the conclusion that travel

24

expenses and per diem were intended under the statute.

25

I think that the language of the statute

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 626-0300

1

simply does not amount to what Respondents are arguing.

2

Congress could have written Section 7131 with different

3

langua ge.

4

It could have said collective bargaining

5

amounts to being on-duty status.

6

have said collective bargaining for the purposes of

7

Chapter 57, the part that relates to travel expenses and

8

per diem outside of Title VII, collective bargaining

9

shall constitute official business.

10

Better yet it could

It did not say any of these things.

Rather

11

the language that Congress did use was and the term of

12

art "official time" which had this construction under

13 the old program of no travel expenses, no per diem, that
14

is, the unions for those costs and Congress also

15

referred to the time an employee otherwise would be in a

16 duty status.
17

Now that language suggests that you simply

18 cannot draw out the eguivalancy of collective bargaining
19

and duty status that Respondents have suggested in this

20

case, and we think the medly of various agency

21

regulations and decisions that they have cited from

22

different statutes and different periods of time simply

23

do not add up to the conclusion they have drawn.

24

think if you look individually at those particular

I

25 references and look at them collectively they do not

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUTH E. PETERS, ESQ.,

5

8

Very well.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. PETERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At issue here today in the first Federal Labor

9

Relations Authority case to be heard by this Court is

10

the Authority’s determination that a federal employee

11

union representative who is granted official time to

12

participate in collective bargaining negotiations is

13

entitled to receive a per diem allowance and travel

14

expenses from the employer agency for travel in

15

connection with the negotiations.

16

Now as the Ninth Circuit recognized in this

17

case the Authority's determination is correct

18

essentially for these reasons:

19

Authority correctly discerned the congressional

20

objectives underlying the federal sector labor statute

21

and adopted an interpretation of the official time

22

provision that comports with and furthers those

23

objectives; and second, because employee representatives

24

who are on official time for negotiations are engaged in

25

official business within the meaning of the Travel

first, because the

20

1

Expense Act and are accordingly entitled to the payment

2

of travel expenses.

3

Now I intend to discuss both of those points,

4

and in the process I

also hope to discuss the ways in

5

which

0

bargaining under the federal sector statute differs from

the nature and scope and purpose of collective

7

bargaining under

the old executive order program or in

8

the private sector under the National labor Relations

9

Act because ultimately the test of the appropriateness

10

of the Authority’s determination is not whether it would

11

have been appropriate under the old executive orders or

12

in the private sector, but rather —

13
14

QUESTION*

absentmindedly overlooked this problem?

15

MS. PETERS*

16 overlooked it.
17

Is it your view that Congress just

I do not think Congress

It did not address it directly, but it

did choose a certain term "official time" from which I

18 think it is reasonable to say that certain consequences
19
20
21
22

flow.
QUESTION*

Do you agree that it shows that

Congress had the general subject matter in mind?
MS. PETERS*

It had in mind what status it

23

wanted these people to be on while they were bargaining,

24

negotiating and —

25

QUESTION*

Would that not reasonably suggest

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

all the other problems that were related to it?

2
3

MS. PETERS*

I think that Congress could have

seen that it chose the phrase "official time" to which

4 attributes of employment could attach, and we agree with
5

Respondent, NTEU, in this regard that it is significant

6

that Congress chose this term because it does equate

7 with duty time or work time and is different from
8

nonduty time or leave cr administrative leave or excused

9 absence.
10
11

We are not the only ones to see this
distinction.

Even the Petitioner, I think, at footnote

12 five of its reply brief sees a difference between
13 official time on the one hand and leave time on the
14 other.

The executive orders distinguished between

15 official time and nonduty time.
16

Executive Order 10988, for example, said that

17 employer-employee meetings should be conducted on
18 official time wherever possible but that the employer
19

could require that negotiations be conducted on nonduty

20 time.
21

Furthermore, as we noted —
QUESTION *

Do you agree w ith the proposition

22

that before you can hold the United States government

23

respon sible fo the payment cf money it has to be in

24 clear and unambiguous language?
25

MS. PETERS*

Well, I certainly do not agree

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

with the Petitioner's approach to the authority that

2

they have cited in their brief.

3

QUESTIONi

I did not say the Petitioners.

I

4 said ge.

MS. PETERS;

5

Hell/ there are a number of

6

statutes that deal with the federal work force that have

7

broad statutory terms such as "official time” or in the

8

Fair Labor Standards Act, for example, "hours of work".

9

There are
* a number of remedial and compensatory statutes

10

that have such terms.
If that rule were to be applied really

11

12

strictly it would just shut off one side of the ability

13

to —

14
15
16
17

QUESTION;

Give me one statute that says

official time which includes travel time.
MS. PETERS;

I cannot cite you to a statute

that says official time —

18

QUESTION;

19

MS. PETERS;

But do you not need one?
No, because I think official time

20

means duty time or duty status and that connotes that it

21

is official business within the meaning of the Travel

22

Expense Act and that the things that you have going when

23

you are on official time, paid time, time for which you

24

are paid by the government —

25

QUESTION;

Would you go so far as to say that

23

1

if you go to a meeting in Paris you could charge the

2 government with the Concorde rates?
MS. PETERS*

3

Well, that would be a subject I

4

guess for the GSA travel regulations as to what kind of

5

carrier you can take, but that is not really the issue

6

here.

7
8

As I was saying, we are not the only ones to
see the difference between official time and duty time.

9

QUESTION*

10

the language "official time"?

11

MS. PETERS*

12

QUESTIONS

But is your sole reliance not on

Our sole reliance on that?
Yes, that should be interpreted to

13

mean official business and hence subject to

14

reimbursement for travel expenses.

15

MS. PETERS*

Well, our reliance is on that and

16

our reliance is on the congressional objectives and

17

purposes where they found collective bargaining to be in

18

the public interest.

19

QUESTIONS

I know, but if they had not —

20 Suppose they had decided not to subsidize collective
21

bargaining at all.

22

MS. PETERS*

23

QUESTION*

24
25

Right.
You would not then be here making a

claim would you?
MS. PETERS:'

That is right.

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

QUESTION*

Except for the official time and

2

the payment of wages while you are bargaining you would

3

not be here.

4

MS. PETERS;

5

QUESTION*

That is right.
So is there any historical support

6

in the executive orders or practice in the government

7

for suggesting that official time includes travel?

8
9

MS. PETERS*

Well, the Assistant Secretary of

Labor Management Relations Regulations under the

10

executive order provided that witnesses at hearings be

11

granted official time, and they also got travel

2

expenses.

3

them.

He precluded the payment of overtime for

4

Also as I remember —

5

QUESTION*

But that is a far cry from saying

6

-- Witnesses is one thing, tut representing an

7

organization as its bargaining representative is

8

another.

9

practice?

20

Is that all you have got for the past

MS. PETERS:

Well, we have that and then, of

2

course, under Executive Order 10988 did provide that

22

meetings and consultations could be conducted on

23

official time and the Comptroller General first said

24

that they could not get travel expenses either but then

25

he modified that in keeping with the Civil Service

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Commission guidelines so that it would seem that in some

2

circumstances —

3

QUESTION*

4

MS. PETERS*

5

QUESTION*

6

MS. PETERS*

How did he modify it?
Pardon?
How did he modify it?
He modified it by saying that

7

travel expenses could be paid pursuant to the Civil

8

Service Commission guidelines which those guidelines for

9

the most part did not allow the payment of travel

10 expenses for negotiations.

But then negotiations under

11

that executive order — The use of official time was not

12

encouraged for negotiations under that executive order,

13

but one could assume that for the activities for which

14

official time could be used or was encouraged under the

15

executive order assumably travel expenses could be

16

paid.

17

QUESTION*

Do you know of any instances in the

18

past where travel expenses have actually been paid for

19

the time spent negotiating or to go and come from

20 negotiating sessions?

21

MS. PETERS*

You mean before the Act?

I do

22 not have anything that I can cite to, but as I recall -23

Well, I do not have anything I can cite to on that.

24

QUESTION*

25

MS. PETERS*

Is there any practice since?
In the payment -- Well, people

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

are sort of waiting to see what this Court does in it

2

before —

3
4
5

6
7

QUESTION*;

Has anybody actually paid the

expenses up to date?
MS. PETERS;

Not that I knmow of, no, but that

is because the matter has been in litigation I believe.
I would note that ether attributes of

8

employment do attach to time spent in negotiations.

9

example, we noted in our brief that the Office of

10

Personnel Management in the Federal Personnel Manual

11

letter characterized official time spent on

12

representational functions as hours of work.

13

For

Now that characterization on the part of OFF

14

has an operative significance beyond that FPM letter

15

because the same phrase appears in its regulations

16

applying the Fair Labor Standards Act to federal

17

employees, and there 0PM provides in 5CFR551.424E that

18

official time is hours of work for FSLA purposes.

19

On the other hand, it says that such things as

20

leave and holidays and excused absences which it calls

21

paid periods of nonwork in 5CFR551.401 is not hours of

22

work for FSLA purposes.

23

employment that attaches to someone on official time.

So that is one attribute of

24

Then as we have also noted —

25

QUESTION;

Who promulgated those regulations,

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

Ms. Peters?
MS. PETERSs

That was 0PM.

That was 0PM which

3

administers the Fair Labor Standards Act as it applies

4

to federal employees.

5

As we have also noted --

6

QUESTION:

7

8
9

10

What is the relationship between

the FLRA and 0PM?
MS. PETERS:

They are separate agencies with

separate areas of responsibility.
As we also noted an employee who would be

11

injured traveling to or from negotiations would be

12

considerd to be injured in the course of duty for

13

Federal Employee Compensation Act purposes,

and it also

14
15

QUESTION:

If you analogize that to state

16

workmen's compensation laws, certainly state workmen's

17

compensation laws have been extended to situations where

18

they will find something arose out of and in the course

19

of employment that it is inconceivable the employee

20 would have been paid for if he had been demanding pay.
21

MS. PETERS:

That may be, but my point is that

22

there are a number of attributes of employment that

23

attach to someone who is in the federal sector on

24

official time for —

25

QUESTION:

I am suggesting your last example

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

proves very little.
MS. PETERS*

2

I think, that perhaps more

3

instructive than the various factors that support our

4

view that it is official business, that time spent

5

negotiating is official business is the fact that

6

Petitioner really has net provided any reason why

7

negotiations should not be considered official

8

business.
""N

9

Petitioner suggested a test which says that

10

official business — that an activity is not official

11

business unless it is conducted under the direction of a

12

supervisor or that the quality of the employee's

13

performance can be appraised.

14

has cited no support in statute or regulation or case

15

authority for that test.

16

However, the Petitioner

In fact, the authority cited at pages 42 and

17

43 of our brief which indicates that the official

18

business designation is given to activities that are not

19

directly mission related contradicts that contention.

20

That authority applies, for example, to employees who

21

attend administrative employment-related hearings about,

22

for example, their own suspensions or their own

23

performance appraisal appeal, and it shows that it

24

covers things such as going to meetings and conferences

25

and seminars and that sort of thing which may or may not

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

be directly mission-related.
Petitioner also points to the language of

2
3

Section 7131(a)

4

on official time will be on official time or the

5

employee otherwise would have in duty status.

6

Petitioner suggests that Congress intended by this

7

langauge either to say that they were not really on duty

8

time or that because they would generally travel and

9

take meals while they are not on duty time that Congress

10

which specifies that an employee who is

The

meant by this language to preclude travel expenses.
But suffice it to say that very similar

11
12

language apeared in the Assistant Secretary of Labor's

13

regulations under the executive order and there travel

14

expenses and per diem were paid, but overtime was

15

excluded.

16

regulations regarding official time where it appears to

17

be viewed merely as the restriction on the amount of

18

unscheduled overtime that can be counted as hours of

The language also appears in OPtf's FLSA
1

19 work.

So I think the most reasonable view of that

20
21

language is that it is a restriction on the payment of

22

overtime and premium paid to employees who are involved

23

in negotiations and not on the payment of travel

24

expenses.

25

in the reply brief that "official time" is a term of art

Petitioner has also suggested here today and

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

simply used in labor relations programs and that it does

2

not operate to signify entitlement to travel and per

3

diem.

4

Well, the term "official time" was used in the

5

executive orders, and it is used in the federal sector

6

statute, but it has no more artful use than to signify

7

that certain activies are to be conducted on duty time,

8

paid time rather than on nonduty time.

9

supports rather than defeats the notion that the

10

This usage

employee who is engaged in activities that are conducted
on official time is engaged in official business.

12

So as far as our position that this is

3

official business, that negotiations is official

4

business I would point then to the way Congress

5

characterized the time spent in the activity and the

6

great importance that it attached to the activity, that

7

is, that it is something that is in the public

8

interest.

9

is employment related.

The nature of the activity, that is, that it
It certainly seems to me that

20

something that is federal employment related could fall

21

within the sphere of official business and in fact as I

22

indicated people who attend administrative hearings

23

about their own grievances or suspensions or performance

24

appraisal appeals are considered to be on official

25

business and entitled to travel expenses.

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

So I think all those factors point to the

1

2

conclusion that these employees are on official

3

business.

4

point because when the Authority based on the goals and

5

objectives of its statute also determined that employees

Now I would like to address the deference

6 are engaged in official business within the meaning of
7

the Travel Expense Act the courts that ruled adversely

8

on this issue and the Petitioner take the position that

9

for that reason the Authority is owed less than usual

10

deference because it refers to another statute.
Now first of all as both Judges Haney and

11
12

Oakes pointed out in their dissents in the Eighth and

13

Second Circuits this position of the Petitioner and the

14

other courts is in error because first of all the very

15

core of the Authority’s analysis here is of the

16

interpretation of the terms of its own statute, but in

17

any event the notion that the Authority is necessarily

18

owed less deference in cases such as this where in order

19

to resolve completely an issue under its own statute it

20

has to look outside in an ancillary fashion at another

21

statute —;

22

QUESTION*

What you are saying is that they

23

are construing the authority of another agency, the

24

authority conferred by Congress on a different agency.

25

MS. PETERS*

Well, first I would note that GSA

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

which has authority under the Travel Expense Act in its

2

regulations has essentially said that individual

3

agencies can authorize travel and thus determine whether

4

it is official business or not except as otherwise

5

provided by law.

6

from that that when an agency is affected by someone

7

else’s enabling statute such as the FIRA statute that it

I would think it would be fair tc take

8 is up to the FLRA to determine what is official business
9

within the meaning of that enabling statute.
QUESTION*

10

But the underlying proposition is

11

that it is the business of the agency.

12

business of the agency is what is covered by the GSA

13

provision.

14

NS. PETERSs

15

QUESTION:

The central

Yes.
In other words, if a judge is

16

assigned from one district to another he is authorized

17

to have his expenses paid and his per diem, but there he

18

is engaged or she is engaged in the business of that

19

agency and not some other agency.

20

MS. PETERS:

Yes.

But an individual federal

21

agency besides having its own enabling statute is

22

covered by a number of statutes and regulations dealing,

23

well, such as in this case with federal personnel

24

matters, and travel could be connected with those

25

statutes as well.

It would seem reasonable that the

33

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

person responsible or the agency responsible for those

2 statutes would determine whether something is official
3
4

business within the terms of that statute.
As I was saying this notion that the Authority

5

is necessarily owed less deference in a situation such

6

as this where it finds it necessary to look outside to

7 another statute has troubling implications not only for
8

this case but also for the Authority's ability in the

9

future to function in the way that Congress intended.

10

The Authority has a unique enabling statute and in some

11

instances there is an express direction that they may

12

have to look outside the statute in order to resolve

13

completely an issue arising under the statute.

14

For example, in Section 7117 under which the

15

Authority makes determinations of negotiability it must

16

determine according to Congress whether a union

17

bargaining proposal is not inconsistent with any federal

18

law or any government-wide rule or regulation.

19

Congress did not set out a separate standard of review

20

for negotiability determinations, however.

Now the

21

The standard of review for those final orders

22

is the same as for other final orders of the authority.

23

That is, it will not be set aside unless it is arbitrary

24

and capricious.

25

I think that it is just a matter of common

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

sense that even where Congress has not made it express

2

that an agency such as the FLEA that administers a

3

federal sector collective bargaining program will from

4

time to time have to resolve issues that in an ancillary

5

fashion implicate federal personnel laws or regulations

6

or other laws or regulations affecting the federal work

7

force or work place and this case is an example —

NS. PETERS:

Ns. Peters, can I ask a question at

Sure.
It goes to the standard of the

problem and the method of review.

13

MS. PETERS:

14

QUESTION:

Sure.
Supposing the issue arose such as

15

Justice Marshall asked you about that whether the

16

employee was entitled to take first class because there

17

was not tourist available or something that went to the

18

amount of the travel expense reimbursement and there was

19

a refusal to pay the requested amount, could the

20

employee under your view of the statutory scheme cite

21

that as ah unfair labor practice and ask that it be

22

decided by ycur Authority?

23

NS. PETERS:

They might try to take it up

24

through the unfair labor practice route.

If they were

under a collective bargaining agreement it could also I

MS. PETEHS:

The Authority would be bound by

10

the GSA*s federal travel regulations which it recently

11

recognized in a negotiability determination are a

government-wide regulation and that an issue cannot be

QUESTION:

Nell, what if we had here -- I know

17

we do not, but what if we had here a regulation by the

18

Comptroller General labeled travel regulation and it

19

said just what the Solicitor General is sayino here that

20

union negotiating sessions do not support a travel

21

expense claim?

22

MS. PETEHS:

Well, one point in that regard is

23

that GSA has never before or since the Authority's

24

determination said anything like that nor has Congress.

25

It has been silent in the nearly four years since the

QUESTION*

Is that what you are

If they had such a regulation?
Yes.
That said that -If we knew that the Comptroller

10 General in some written formal document had adopted the
11

position of the Solicitor General in this case, would it

12 be a different law suit?
13

MS. PETERS*

If he issued a decision or if the

14 GSA instead of having the regulation saying that an
15

agency may determine whether it is authorized travel or

16 not, yes, it would be a different case and the Authority
17

would have to look at those regulations.

But that is

18 not the case here.
19

Traditionally the Comptroller General has

20 given leeway ever since the Civil Service Commission
21

days to the labor relations body to determine the travel

22 expenses and official time question.
23

At this point the

Comptroller General has noticed that even as to his

24 official time rulings under the executive orders that

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that any discussion of the cost of the Authority's

2

determinaton must necessarily take into account the

3

benefits that Congress viewed as being derived from

4

collective bargaining such as increased productivity or

5

more efficient government which would in some sense cut

6

down on the overall cost of government one would think.

Have you got any commentators in

this case?

9

(Laughter)

10

MS. PETERS*

11

to cite, student or nonstudent.

12

I have not a single commentator

I would note that the statute by its own terms

13

and also the Authority decisions set limits on the

14

entitlement to official time and thus accordingly to the

15

entitlement to travel and per diem.

16

expressly limits the number of employee representatives

17

who are entitled to official time to the number of

18

management representatives, and that is a number, of

19

course, that is within the control of the agency.

Section 7131

20

The statute also limits official time

21

entitlement to federal employees so that any union staff

22

members who are involved in the negotiations will not

23

receive either official time or travel expenses.

(Lauq hter)

21

MS. PETERSs

Not if it is official business I

22

do not think, but in any event that is a matter for the

23

parties to determine and in fact given the number of

24

nation-wide bargaining units that is one additional

25

factor in support of the Authority's determination

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

because it facilitates the parties coming to agreement

2 on where to hold the meetings so that if all the
3 management representatives are already centrally located
4

in Washington, D.C., for example, they can bring the

5 union representatives in there and there will not be any
6 cost of travel for the management representatives at
7 all.
8
9

I would address one final point and that is
the third ground upon which the Authority relied in

10 defining which the Ninth Circuit relied in finding that
11

the Authority’s determination was correct and that is

12 that the Authority’s reading of the official time
13 provision of Section 7131A which entitled negotiators to
14 payment of travel expenses and per diem is consistent
15

with the Authority’s reading of Section 7131C which

16 enables the Authority to determine that an employer
17

agency will grant official time and in the Authority’s

18 view travel expenses and per diem to employee
19

participants in Authority proceedings.

Now the —

21

QUESTIONj

Have you said as much as you are

22 going to say, Ms. Peters, about why this is justifiably
23 different than private collective bargaining?
24

HS. PETERS*

It is different from private

25 collective bargaining first of all because in the

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

private sector there is no statutory official time

2

requirement and secondly because both the parties to

3

private bargaining are private parties there is not even

4

a question of equalizing public funding support.

5

QUESTIONi

But you can look at that two

6

different ways I think.

7

sector bargaining as the government, the employer

8

representing the public but the employees are

9

representing an adverse faction just as they would

You can look at the public

10

represent an adverse faction in private sector

11

bargaining.

12

The fact that all are government employees in

13

a technical sense I do not think really makes it

14

irreputable, the other position.

15

MS. PETERS s

Well, I think there are

18

differences in the nature and scope and structure cf

17

private sector bargaining as compared to federal sector

18

bargaining which means that it may well not be an

19

appropriate determination in the private sector but it

20

is supportable here.

21

private sector is very broad entailing a large number of

22

economic items for one thing, and in the structure

23

emphasis is upon private ordering with the parties

24

largely left free to muster up whatever economic forces

25

they can to bring to bear on the issues.

The scope of bargaining in the

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

For that nature the nature of collective

2

bargaining in the private sector is often referred to as

3

economic warfare with each side having an arsenal of

4

economic weapons such as strike or lock out to enforce

5

their views in bargaining issues.

Now in the federal

6 sector that is much different.
7

The scope is narrow with no bargaining over

8

items such as wages or pensions or a host of other iteras

9

that would be bargainable.

10

QUESTION*

In the structure —

Why does narrow versus broad

11

bargaining suggest that your conclusion rather than the

12

opposite one should be reached?

13

MS. PETERS*

14

Because it dictates that there is

a different nature of bargaining.

While certainly the

15 bargaining that occurs in the federal sector is an arms
16 length transaction with independent views being
17

expressed by both sides of the table, it cannot be

18 characterized as economic warfare because there are no
19 economic weapons.

We are not concerned about an

20 economic balance, and there are no legal economic
21
22

weapons such as strike or lock out.
QUESTION*

That shows why it may be different

23

but why does it show that it is more likely that the

24

official time should be construed to include what you

25

contend it is here as oposed to the private sector?

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MS. PETERS i

Because it is a question here.

21

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, just a few

points.
We are not in any way suggesting that the FLEA

22

should never look outside its own statute, and I do not

23

want to leave the Court with that impression.

24

that the core of the analysis of the FLRA does encompass

25

a reference to a statute outside of its own

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

jurisdiction, and we suggest that that may diminish the

2

deference that is due and we also suggest that the

3

Authority is inconsistent with the general approach of

4

the General Services Administration in this area in

5

which the agency is in the best position to determine

6

its own mission and to determine whether travel

7

corresponds to that mission.
To the extent that Ms. Peters suggested that

the term "official business" shows up in Title VII,

MS. CORWIN i

1

Well, generally there is a

2

considerable amount of deference given to the

3

Comptroller General's views, and I would like to clarify

4

the executive order situation in which the Comptroller

5

General rules that in the case in which an agency

7

government that there could be authorization of travel

8

expenses.

9

authorization.

10

Now this was by no means a blanket

The principle here articulated by the

11

Comptroller General was that if the agency concludes

12

that it is for the interest of the government, more

13

convenient,

14

particular fact situation could conclude that it was

15

appropriate to pay the expenses but not in the sort of

broad situation you have here not generally for

collective bargaining purposes.

aware of this Comptroller General interpretation and

20

that it did adopt this sense in the same sense that it

interest is one with which we have no difficulty.

Finally, I think the

that Congress somehow intended to shift the expenses in
