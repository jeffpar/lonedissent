ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. LESLIE A. BENITEZ, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. BENITEZ*

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
This case is pending before the Court on the
petition of Texas to review a decision of the United

10

States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granting

11

federal habeas corpus relief.

12

herein is whether a criminal defendant who invokes his

13

Faretta v. California right cf self-representation

14

suffers a constitutional deprivation if standby counsel

15

intermittently participates in the trial proceedings.

16

The sole issue involved

I will first briefly discuss the facts of the

17

case and the holdings of the court below and then will

18

urge the Court to reject the holding of the Fifth

19

Circuit that when a defendant invokes his constitutional

20

right of self-representation, standby counsel must in

21

all circumstances be seen and not heard.

22

Respondent's first trial was in San Antonio,

23

Texasl in January of 1973.

He was convicted and

24

received a life sentence.

25

reversed due to a defective indictment.

His conviction, however, was

subject of the instant proceedings, occurred in June

however, over Respondent's objections, appointed standby

counsel.

QUESTION:

Now, two counsel were appointed,

weren't they?

14

MS. BENITEZ:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Xhrough the briefs I find small

16

mention of Mr. Samples, was that his name?

18

MS. BENITEZ:

Did he just

19

participated to a very limited extent by occasionally

20

bringing a matter or two to the attention of the trial

21

court out of the presence of the jury.

22

participate hardly at all in the trial proceedings.

23

QUESTION:

But he did

So your opposition would take the

24

position that the two counsels stood in stark contrast

25

one to the other.

1

MS. PENITEZj

I don't believe that Respondent

2

has particularly made that argument, but the record does

3

reflect that that is the case.

4

Some of the intermittent participation of

5

counsel was overtly encouraged by Respondent, some was

8

done without objection by him, and some was done over

7

his objection.

8

most of the assistance provided by standby counsel did

9

occur out of the presence of the jury.

The record does reflect, however, that

The record also

10

reflects that counsel inexcusably and indefensibly twice

11

cursed, once in the presence of the jury.

12

QUESTION;

Counsel?

13

MS. BENITEZs

14

More importantly, however, for this Court's

15

analysis, the record reflects that Respondent himself

16

made the decision to proceed to trial in this case,

17

examined the jury panel and selected the jurors, argued

18

both pretrial and trial motions to the court, cross

19

examined the state's witnesses, chose his defensive

20

theory and strategy, presented and examined his own

21

witnesses, and argued his case to the jury.

22

times during the course of the trial when conflict arose

23

between standby counsel and Respondent.

24

however, reflects, that the trial court always and

25

without exception recognized Respondent’s right to make

That's correct. Your Honor.

There were

The record,

440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 826-9300

1

the necessary decisions and sustained the Respondent's

2

posit ion.
The District Court on federal habeas corpus

3
4

review reviewed the entire record of the trial

5

proceedings and held that on the record as a whole the

6

Respondent in this case was accorded his right under

7

Faretta v. California.

8

reversed, holding that the limited participation of

9

standby counsel constituted a denial of Respondent's

The Fifth Circuit, however,

10

Faretta right, and that the conviction must be set

11

aside.

12

The opinion of the Fifth Circuit strictly

13

applied Faretta and held that when a defendant invokes

14

his constitutional right to self-representation under

15

Faretta, standby counsel must be seen and not heard and

16

that interference by standby counsel will result in a

17

violation of the Sixth Amendment.

18

QUESTION:

Ms. Benitez, under Faretta, do you

19

think a trial judge is permitted, once a defendant

20

invokes his right to represent himself, to say okay,

21

fine, but you are on your own?

22

appoint any standby counsel because there are just too

23

many problems such as might have emerged in this case.

24
25

I am not going to

Do you think the trial court is under any
obligation to appoint standby counsel?

SS. BENITEZ;

1
2

5

I don't believe that the

trial court does have that obligation.
QUESTION;

3
4

No,

Why do so many of them do it,

then?
MS. BENITEZ;

I believe that the trial courts

6

do it because it makes the trial in a case such as the

7

instant case less burdensome to the trial court.

8

the trial court to have a party there who is present

For

\

through the trial proceedings to whom he can refer the
10

pro se defendant when matters arise that require that

11

the defendant be advised of courtroom procedures or

12

other matters which the trial court wants the defendant

13

to be aware of.

14

that trial courts do it for, basically for two reasons;

15

one, so that there will be an attorney there who can

16

bring to the attention of the trial court necessary

17

matters which, for example, counsel notices but the

18

trial court doesn't notice.

1

I believe that it is the interest --

QUESTION;

Well, of course, when the defendant

20

has elected to go on his own, I would think the trial

21

court would feel relieved of that sort of

22

responsibility.

23

NS. BENITEZ;

Your Honor, I believe that the

24

argument to that effect that the Respondent has made

25

overlooks the fact that the trial court also has an

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S- 300

1

interest in the fundamental fairness of the trial

2

proceedings and has an interest in ensuring that a

3

criminal defendant who is going to be conficted pursuant

4

to that court's judgment obtains a fundamentally fair

5

trial.
QUESTION:

6

Are you familiar with some of the

7

cases in which after a defendant asserted his Faretta

8

right to try his own case and the court did not appoint

9

counsel to stand by, and then later that same defendant

10

attacked the results on the grounds that the court

11

should

12

you cited any of those cases here?

13

have appointed someone one a standby basis?

MS. BENITEZ:

Have

Your Honor, I believe that those

14

that the — that some of those cases have been cited.

15

believe so because that argument has been raised from

16

time to time by pro se defendants.

17

I

Se would urge the Court to reverse the

18

decision of the Fifth Circuit and urge the Court to hold

19

that the essence of the right protected in Faretta is

20

the opportunity for the criminal defendant to manage,

21

control and conduct his own defense, to personally

22

participate in the proceedings, and to personally argue

23

his case to the finders of the fact, and this

24

opportunity the Respondent in this case clearly had.

25

Rather than adopt the opinion of the Fifth

8

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Circuit, we urge the Court to adopt a standard of review

2

which inquires into whether cr not a pro se defendant

3

had a genuine opportunity to act in his own behalf, to

4

manage and control his own defense, and to reject the

5

notion that some assistance provided by standby counsel,

6

even that assistance provided over the objection of the

7

defendant, constitutes constitutional error entitling

8

the defendant to either habeas corpus relief cr a

g

reversal of his criminal conviction.

10

To hold otherwise, we submit, would totally

11

bind the hands of standby counsel when counsel sees some

12

matter occurring during the 'trial which might result in

13

a serious due process violation from bringing that

14

matter to the trial court's attention or, in fact, from

15

interjecting himself, into the proceedings in time to

18

prevent such error from occurring.

17

More importantly, however, we urge that the

18

rigid rule of the Fifth Circuit would place upon

ig

trial courts in these cases the responsibility for

20

sometimes acting in the role of an advocate for the

21

criminal defendant where the court sees that seme error

22

is occurring or is about to occur which threatens to

23

undermine the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.

24
25

the

An example of that happened in the instant
case where the record reflects that the trial judge

trying

this case usually sat to hear civil cases

2

he brought the jury panel into the courtroom, he began

3

to instruct them on basic principles of criminal law.

4

The trial court then inadvertently and mistakenly

5

advised that jury panel that the Respondent was being

6

tried as a repeater, or a repeat offender, indicating to

7

the jury that the Respondent had a prior criminal

8

record

When

\

Standby counsel at that point made an

9
10

objection and pointed out to the trial court that that

11

was error.

12

committed error inadvertently, then quashed the entire

13

panel and seated another panel who eventually heard

14

Respondent's case.
QUESTION:

16

The trial court, recognizing that he had

Ms. Benitez, let me take up once

more the subject I asked you about earlier.

17

I gather from this last incident you have

18

described that it is the general practice in Texas,

19

feeling of the trial judges, that a defendant who

20

chooses to invoke his Faretta rights really can't get

21

even a fundamentally fair trial without standby

22

counsel?

23

MS. FENXTEZ:

the

No, Your Honor, I can’t

24

represent that that is the position of all the trial

25

judges in Texas.

I think it’s important to note that in

10

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) «20-0300

1

this particular case which was triad in 1972, the trial

2

judge was — this was, of course, prior to Faretta and

3

prior to this Court’s opinion recognizing the federal

4

constitutional right.

5

years a defendant had had a right to proceed pro se, and

6

the Fifth Circuit had long recognized a federally

7

constitutionally protected right to act in his own

8

b eh al f .

However, in Texas for many, many

\

9

What I am urging is that the trial court --

10

the trial court should have the discretion to appoint

11

standby counsel as he does, but also to allow counsel to

12

act almost in the role of an amicus.

13

perceives that some error is occurring in the trial or

14

if the trial court wants someone there who might bring

15

to his attention error which the trial court commits and

18

doesn't recognize at the time, such as the error which

17

was committed in this case.

18

QUESTION*

If the trial court

Well, what happened, if this was

19

tried in 1972, if this is happening, the federal habeas

20

is eleven years later?

21

MS. BENITEZ;

Do you happen to know off hand?
Yes, Your Honor.

The Respondent

22

in this case filed a direct appeal, has filed numerous,

23

I believe, five or six state habeas actions and several

24

federal actions also.

25

been litigating the validity of his conviction since

The case is -- the Respondent has

11

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that time through the state courts and through the

2

federal courts.

3

QUESTION:

He finally male the grade.

4

NS. BENITEZ:

5

QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Ns. Benitez, this is irrelevant,
/•

6

but what has happened to Nr. Estelle who is on so many

7

cases here?

NS. BENITEZ:

8
9
10

Is he no longer in office?
Nr.

Estelle has resigned as

Director of Texas Department of Corrections, and Nr.
McKaskle is now the Acting Director.
The Respondent in this case argues that there

11
12

can be no valid reason for standby counsel ever to speak

13

of and voice an objection to the proceedings citing this

14

Court's procedural default cases such as Wainwright v.

15

Sykes and Engla v. Isaac.
We urge, however, that this argument ignores

16
17

doctrines recognized by the courts, both state and

18

federal, of plain error and fundamental error, which is

19

error requiring reversal even in the absence of any

20

objection.

21

the part of standby counsel to speak, up and bring to the

22

attention of the trial court some matter which threatens

23

to undermine the basic fairness of the proceedings, this

24

would have the result of perhaps undermining the

25

finality of criminal convictions also in that if some

It is also true that absent some ability on

12

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

error were occurring at the trial and standby counsel

2

were permitted to voice objection to it at that time,

3

the trial court would have the opportunity to take

4

remedial action, thus removing error from the case,

5

before the individual was convicted and the case went up

6

on appeal before a reviewing court.

7
8

QUESTION*

Of course, another way of

preventing relitigation of those things would be for it
to be established that a Faretta defendant is genuinely

10

on his own and that what ha doesn’t object to at trial

11

he can’t raise later.

12

NS. BENITEZ*

That’s true, and I think under

13

most circumstances that would be the result and that

14

would be the holding of the reviewing court.

15

some matters, however, which courts will find go —

16

infect the proceedings to such an extent that the trial

17

was fundamentally unfair, and the reviewing courts will

18

reverse the conviction absent any objection, whether the

1

defendant was represented by counsel or not.

There are

20

And we would submit that it is this interest

21

of the courts and the state and also the defendants in

22

some finality of the confictions to permit standby

23

counsel to raise some objections to the trial court.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, the prosecutor as well has

obligations to ensure a basically fair proceeding, isn’t

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that true?
MS. BENITEZ;

2

Yes, that is true, and I think

3

that there is, under most circumstances, a much greater

4

burden on the prosecutor to make sure of the fairness of

5

the proceedings when a defendant is acting pro se.

6

~s this Court is aware, and as all courts are aware,

Eut

|

7

rror sometimes occurs, and sometimes even inadvertent

8

error can do grave harm to constitutionally protected

9

rights.
So we would ask this Court, in addition to

10
11

recognizing the interest of the defendant in proceeding

12

pro se, to also recognize the interests of both the

13

state and the courts in ensuring that fundamental

14

fairness occurs in criminal proceedings.

15

certainly these interests cannot override the interests

16

of the pro se defendant, as this Court held in Faretta,

17

we submit that all interests can be protected if this

18

Court adopts a standard of review on a case-by-case

19

basis which inquires into whether a pro se defendant had

20

a genuine opportunity to manage, control and conduct his

21

defense.

22

QUESTION:

While

Ms. Benitez, to agree with

you, do

23

we have either to overrule Faretta or substantially to

24

retreat from it?

25

MS. BENITEZ;

No,

Your Honor, I don't believe

1U

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that this Court would even have to substantially retreat

2

from Faretta in order to reverse the decision of the

3

Fifth Circuit because the position that we are taking is

4

not inconsistent with Faretta.
The language which the Respondent relies upon

5
6

heavily, found in a footnote in Faretta which states

7

that standby counsel must be — should be ready to

8

provide assistance if and when the defendant requests

9

it, I believe properly defines the role of standby

10

counsel, but what issue — what was not before the Court

11

in deciding Faretta is what happens where the defendant

12

proceeds pro se and is allowed to represent himself,

13

clearly to make strategic decisions, to examine

14

witnesses, to argue his case to the jury, but standby

16

counsel is permitted intermittently to make objections

16

and bring matters to the attention of the trial court.

17

Sc —

18

QUESTION:

Permitted, permitted, do you mean

19

the judge just didn't tell him to sit down?

20

him permission, especially the defendant, did they?

21

MS. BENITEZ:

Nobody gave

I would say in this particular

22

case, counsel was not — the trial court refused to

23

instruct counsel net to make any objections.

24
25

Kow, the record reflects that the trial court,
towards — after the proceedings had begun, the trial

15

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

court began to, if counsel made an objection, to say are

2

you acting with Mr. Wiggifts* permission or do you have

3

the permission?

4

court said.

5

can say anything.

6

of the bases of the complaint of the Respondent is that

7

the trial court refused to issue a broad instruction

8

tellina standby counsel that he was not to speak up,

9

that basically,

10

We have some ground rules here, the

QUESTION;

What do you think about that

11

reaction of

13

the judge?

MS. BENITEZ;

Should he have told counsel to

I think that ideally the court,

14

perhaps at an earlier point in the trial, could have

15

adsvised counsel that he would not be heard --

16

QUESTION;

Of course he could have — he could

17

have advised him any time, but should he, should he,

18

should he have?

19

NS. BENITEZ;

I believe that an appropriate

20

way for the trial court to proceed, and one that I

21

believe would clearly be consistent with the interets of

22

the defendant in Faretta, would be for the trial court

23

to advise counsel that he was not to speak up on the

24

defendant's behalf unless either he had the permission

25

of the defendant or there were some very serious matter

MR. SMYSER;

Your Honor, I have not counted

The Joint Appendix contains the

10

most egregious instances of the interruptions by standby

counsel and also contains illustrations of those times

12

when standby counsel was specifically requested to take

13

some action, which I believe was some six times during

14

the course of the trial.
Furthermore, although the state argues that in

although it was dicta, the footnote 46 in which this

over the objection of an accused, to aid the accused if

right to present his personal defense.

It clearly states the standard

There is no need for a new standard.

is no need to posit this standard of a genuine

that it should be — the opinion of the Fifth Circuit

should be affirmed.

3

QUESTIONi

Mr. Smyser, when you said we would

4

have to overruled Faretta if we conclude to overrule the

5

Fifth Circuit in this case, one of the things that

6

troubles me is that a number of judges have held after

7

reviewing the record which we have not had an

8

opportunity to do, that there was no violation of
\

9.

Faretta.

We start at the magistrater court in which he

10

concludes that Wiggins was indeed allowed the right to

11

conduct his own defense, and then Circuit District Judge

12

Spears said he had reviewed the record carefully and

13

fully agreed with the magistrate's conclusion.
Then the panel, three judges on the panel of

Yes, Your Honor.
And on the second issue, the Court

of Appeals put the burden of proof on the state.
MR. SKYSEF*

Yes, Your Honor.

The Court of

Appeals — the Respondent contends that the harmless

10

error rule should not apply to denials of the right to

11

conduct one's own defense.

12

constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that its

13

infraction can never be treated as harmless error.

14

most obvious logical counterpart is the right to

15

counsel, and this Court in Kolloway v. Arkansas -- it

16

involved a question of whether the denial of the right

17

to counsel could ever be harmless error, and in holding

18

that it couldn't be, this court held and noted that in

19

the normal case where the harmless error rule is

20

applied, the error is readily identifiable.

21

was not the case with the right to counsel.

Respondent submits that if the harmless error

rule is applied, this is the correct application of that

rule.
