CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Miller, I think you

may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC R. MILLER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLANTS
MR . MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I wish to remind the Court in this consolidated
action that there are two Appellant groups, the first

10

consisting of the labor organization, and the second

11

consisting of state officials.

12
13
14

We have agreed upon a single speaker to avoid
fragmentation of our presentation.
We do submit to the Court that the state

15

officials and the labor organizations have both common

111

interests as well as unique interests which justify

17

this Court in reversing the lower court.

18

QUESTION:

MR. tlILLER:

Which case are you from or in?
Your Honor, the clients that

20

I represented in the action below were the defendant

21

labor organizations.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. MILLER:

Thank you.
The primary issue in this case

2"

is whether or not a state public employee bargaining

25

law violates either the First or the Fourteenth

Amendments where it requires a public employer to meet

2

and confer only with an exclusive representative and

3

that exclusive representative uses only its members

4

as apart of the meet and confer meeting.

15

In the alternative, should this Cou r t affirm

e

the lower court, the second issue is if every public employee

7

is entitled to run and vote in elec t ions for membership

8

on the meet and confer committees , do the First and

9

Fourteenth Amendments require that a s ystem of cumulative

10

voting be utilized in those elections.
The fundamental facts in the case are neither

11

12

extensive nor in dispute.

The Plaintiffs are individual

13

faculty members employed on several of the campuses

14

of the 18-campus system in the Minne s ota Community

115

College syst em.
These individual faculty member Plaintiffs

18

17

are opposed to having the defendant labor organziations

18

represent them concerning their employment interests.
The defendant labor organizations consist of the

19

20

Minnesota Community College Faculty Association, the

21

MCCFA, which is a voluntary association of faculty

22

members within the Community College system.

23

the legally certified exclusive representative for

24

all of the faculty members within the Community College

system.

the parties as well as the public.

22

The policy section further specifically indicates

23

that one of the policies is to grant the employees the

2•

right to organize and choose freely their representatives .

PELRA specifically provides for a democratic selection

8

these policies is the use of the concept of exclusive

All exclusive representa-

That is the right of meet

It requires them to meet with

one group and its option with another, I suppose.
MR. MILLER:

7

It is optional with another

There is, very frankly, Justice White, the

9

question of whether or not the employer possibly com-

10

mitting an unfair labor practice in doing that.

11

do not believe though that that raises a constitutional

12

questions as I will explain in a moment.

said under the state law, if the employer chose to

15

18

any state law .
MR. MILLER:

17

The purpose of meet and confer,

18

we believe, is private consultation not only to permit

19

employees to freely express their views, which, of

20

course, is their First Amendment right, and has been

21

confirmed in this record as well as under PELRA.

That is what I was asking you

awhile ago.

Now, what is your answer to the question.

15

Is he in violation of the state law if he meets with

18

other people or not?
MR. MILLER:

17

I believe the answer is going

18

to be dependent on whether or not that employer, in

19

fact, is exchanging views and holding private consulta-

20

tion as opposed to simply receiving the views of individual

21

employees.

QUESTION:

Well, is there a difference in

Most definitely.

Does the statute define them?

The line that the legislature

Has that term been defined by

your courts?

14

MR. MILLER :

15

QUESTION:

18

MR. MILLER:

Yes, it is .
What is the definition?
Not unlike the problems in

17

the private sector, it is a gray and moving line .

18

Part of it depends on whether or not the employer wants

19

to collectively bargain about that subject even though

20

it may be a matter of inherent management right and

21

make it a permissive subject.

22

And, we have cited several decisions in our

23

brief that indicate how that definition of a meet and

negotiate subject is evolving in our state.

is no bright, clear line.

The point that I want to make in response

to your inquiry, Justice White, is that that line does

not connotate, as the lower court did , some type of

constitutional right, because it is a line that is

drawn --

I think it certainly affects the

way I look at the case as to whether or not, under

state law, anybody but the -- that the employer would

9

violate state law if he meets on meet and confer issues

10

with anybody but the exclusive representative.
MR. MILLER:

I believe the employer can,

12

either at a public meeting or as indicated in this

13

record in sessions held on campus --

14

QUESTION:

Say he does -- Say he meets with

115

a group other than the exclusive representative and

18

he goes through exactly the same routine as he does

17

with the exclusive representative, and if you say he

18

must just listen, then he just listens.

19

is all he does, he is all right under state law?

20

MR. MILLER:

21

QUESTION:

Now, if that

I believe so.
But, I understood from what you

22

said earlier that the Board could make no response

23

on any proposals that were suggested by the non-union

Again, I think the Board can

I think before it would be an

15

MR. MILLER:

The question is hinged on the

18

fact that the exclusive representative has by statute,

17

being the majority representative, the opportunity

18

to present the majority view.

19

nothing to restrict the employer from receiving the

20

And, he can mix the two groups

MR. MILLER:

I think that witnesses may certainly

8

attend a formal meet and confer session, but the purpose

9

of the statute,

just as the purpose of exclusivity

10

in collective bargaining, is to permit in an orderly,

11

coherent fashion for the employer to receive the views

12

of the majority representative.

13

dissident members at a formal meet and confer session

1.C

to present their views at the same time in contrast

15

with the views of the majority would very well disrupt

18

that orderly process just as it would if the dissident

minority members were permitted to be present at a

with the exclusive representative concerning its position

on what the terms and conditions ought to be.

For purposes of that meet and confer meeting, the employe r

QUESTION:

Has there ever been such a meeting,

MR. MILLER :

Yes.

The record is replete

15

that the Community College Board , the Chancellor , who

18

is the Chief Executive Officer, the local presidents

11

The First

a public employer to meet and negotiate, meet and respond

In this case, the legislature in Minnesota

The converse of that is

representatives of the professional employees.

Is even that quite right?

Does

13

the statutory provision dealing with meet and confer

expressly refer to the exclusive bargaining agent?

employees that it wants to have the view of the exclusive
representative concerning those non-negotiable subjects.
QUESTION:

Is it a matter of state interest

not to have divergent views on the policy type issues
that you have been mentioning?

I don't think that the State

of Minnesota is trying to eliminate divergent views.

But, is it contrary to state policy

to have divergent views?

It is not.

for some of the administrators if they had to sit up

I would just point out one thing with respect

to Mr. Miller's emphas is on the fundamenta li ty of this

15

The purpose of this statute, as stated in

It

15

is to obtain the view of all of the professional employees.

I think this is particularly critical in an academic

12

each one fulfilling hopefully an unique nitch in the

system.

It really is not terribly rational to super-

nature of the communications and issues that are

involved in this case.

The District Court pointed out, again I believe

correctly, that in the area of meet and confer you

are dealing with intangible questions inherently and

dealing with questions that involve rather personal

may be required to negotiate only with the exclusive

anybody else and negotiate on those things.

that is a valid situation scheme, why isn't this one?

MR. VIEIRA:

Well, they are operating under

has been cooperating with them since they began running

The Board is s itting on

They are certainly not challenging MCCFA's

They couldn't challenge it .

An

administrator of a state institution has no right to

17

assert against a command of the state.

MR . VIEIRA:

No, but what they could have

19

done to the MCCFA was to say to them this statute does

20

not require you to limit participation in these meet

QUESTION:

That would have been consistent

with the statute, I take it.
MR. VIEIRA:

Yes, sir.

It would have been

consistent with the statute and then we might have
gotten this same result, but instead the Board turned
around and said we are very happy with this, we are
perfectly willing to meet with you to the extent -QUESTION:

But it still was the union decision

about how to structure its committees.

It wasn't a

state decision about how to structure.
MR. VIEIRA:

Well, it was the MCCPA's claim

that it was entitled to select individuals from its
membership only based upon -- It is based upon 179.66,
