CHIEF JJSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

3

first this morning in Secretary of State of Maryland

4

against Joseph Munson Company.

Ms. Motz, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DIANA G. MOTZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MS. MOTZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
All of the issues raised in this case can, I

12

believe, be stated in a single question and that is is a

13

state statute which only limits the amounts a charity may

14

spend on some of its fundraising expenses and which

15

provides the charity a complete exemption from even that

18

limitation under certain circumstances overbroad on its

17

face in violation of the First Amendment; that is has the

18

statute been shown to hav* a substantial number of

19

impermissible applications?

20

This case comes to this Court on the Secretary

21

of the State of Maryland's petition for certiorari asking

22

this Court to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals

23

of Maryland which held such a statute facially overbroad.

24

Maryland has substantial interest, both because

25

...

'S

of its parent patria responsibility with regard to
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

charities and because of its obligations to protect its

2

citizens to ensure the integrity of charitable

3

organizations.

4

The statute, which was invalidated by the Court

5

below, was enacted in response to precisely these concerns

6

as noted in its preamble for prior to its enactment in

7

1976 Maryland law provided, as it does now, for annual

8

registration and disclosure of certain information by

9

non-exempt charitable organizations and paid solicitors

10

and for strict criminal penalties for fraudulent mis­

11

representation .

12

However, the Maryland legislature determined

13

that these measures were not sufficient in light of the

14

activities of some ostensibly charitable organization that

15

had raised millions in contributions but had such

16

excessively high expenses that little of that money had

17

been used for charitable purposes.

18
19

QUESTION:

argument are you going to discuss the standing question?

20
21

MS. MOTZ:

24
25

Yes, sir.

I will address the

standing question right now, Justice Rehnquist.

23

Ms. Motz, at some point in your

I was hoping you would cover something about it.
MS. MOTZ:

can address it right now.

2

I believe there are really sort of three

3

standing questions here before the Court today. There is
<yu
the question of whether there is a case of controversy.
I

4

don't think that there is really any dispute about that.

It seems to me there clearly is.

party which may be suffer possible criminal prosecution

9

under the statute and which may suffer economic injury if

10

This is classically an

the statute is, in fact, validated by this Court.

11

The second type of standing — issue here is the

12

jus tertii standing, the opportunity to present the rights

13

of the Fraternal Order of Police by Munson in this case.

14

It is the State's position that there is no jus

15

tertii standing here.

16

issue is terribly important except in one respect and that

17

is because in any event Munson is going to have to

18

demonstrate overbreadth and it is the State's position

19

that there is no overbreadth standing and there is not an

20

overbreadth challenge on the merits here.

21

determination of those two questions, it seems to me, are

22

linked to the same kind of considerations.

23

QUESTION:

However, I am not sure that that

And, the

Do you think the Maryland Court of

24

Appeals' ruling on standing was based on Maryland law or

25

on federal law?

MS. MOTZ:

Yes, sir.

16

QUESTION:

If you are right on standing, that

14

standing?

17

there is no jus tertii, whatever you call it, standing,

18

what shall we do with the case?

19

MS. MOTZ:

Well, Your Honor, I think that it is

20

very, very clear that the question of whether — The real

21

question here is whether there is overbreadth standing.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

We don't even have to reach that if

we agree with on jus tertii standing.
MS. MOTZ:

Well, I believe you do because it

seems to me that whether or not there is jus tertii

1

standing the Respondent here could make an overbreadth

2

challenge separate and apart from any jus tertii standing.

3

And, it would be the State's submission that the

4

overbreadth challenge is not a good challenge, that the

5

me^j/i}>g determination on overbreadth should be a finding by

6

this Court that this statute is not substantially over­

7

broad and this court should do exactly what it did in New

8

York versus Ferber.

That case came to you from the Court
\

9

of Appeals of New York, the highest Court of the state,

10

and that Court found that the statute was, indeed,

11

overbroad.

12

state court for proceedings consistent with that reversal

13

and that is what I submit should be done here.

14

This Court reversed and sent it back to the

QUESTION:

So, really there is no difference in

15

your view between the standing issue and the merits issue

16

on the overbreadth question?

17

MS. MOTZ:

It took us a long time to get there,^

18

Justice Stevens, but that is, in fact, our position now,

19

yes, sir.

20

The General Assembly, recognizing the activities

21

of some ostensibly charitable organizations that have

22

raised millions of dollars in contributions, but have had

23

such excessively high expenses, that little of that money

24

had been used for charitable purposes, enacted reform

25

legislation, of which the statute challenged here was a

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

principal feature, to provide a more effective regulation

2

over fundraising expenses without imposing an/f intolerable

3

burden on charity and, in the words of the preamble of the

4

statute, "to assure the contributions will be used to

5

benefit the intended purpose."

6

The challenged statute operates as follows:

7

First, it provides that a charity may spend on fundraising

8

expenses no more than 25 percent of the income raised by

9

the fundraising activity.

10

The statute, however, in no way limits a

11

charity's administrative expenses, thus, management,

12

overhead and general staff salaries are subjected to no

13

limitation.

14

In addition, the Maryland statute excludes from

15

the fundraising limitation a number of major items which

16

are ordinarily regarded as fundraising expenses.

17

example, the cost of all goods, food or drink or

18

entertainment sold or provided to the public, the cost of

19

pre-planning and feasibility studies, and the cost of

20

postage and printing are expressly excluded from the fund­

21

raising limitation and so may be freely incurred without

22

limits.

23

For

Moreover, a statute can gain — a charity can

24

gain a complete exemption from the 25 percent limitation

25

when the limitation would effectively prevent the charity

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

from raising contributions and this exemption may be

2

applied for even if the charity has already exceeded the

3

fundraising limitation.

4

Prior to the decision in the court below, the

5

Secretary of State's records show 14 organizations

6

requested and exemption and 13 waivers from the 25 percent

7

limitation were granted.

6
9

If a waiver is granted, then a charity must
disclose to the public every time it solicits on the

10

telephone, in the mail, or in person, that it has been

11

granted a waiver from the .25 percent limitation and the

12

amount that it has been authorized to spend or has spent

13

on fundraising expenses.

14

a waiver is subject to judicial review.

15

Of course, any decision denying

The Respondent, Joseph H. Munson Company, at

16

whose behest, the court below held the statute I have just

17

described unconstitutional, is an Indiana-for-profit

18

corporation whose sole business, according to its amended

19

bill of complaint, is to advise charitable organizations

20

how to go about promoting an entertainment event.

21

Also according to the bill of complaint, Munson

22

regularly collects from charities for its services more

23

than 25 percent of the income raised by these services.

24
25

The firm's only client in Maryland is the

\
Fraternal Order of Police, one of whose chapters, it has

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

been stipulated, was reluctant to enter into a fundraising

2

contract with Munson because of the 25 percent limitation

3

at issue here.

4

In this respect it is significant that a number

5

of other chapters of the same charity, the Fraternal Order

6

of Police, have on several occasions applied for a waiver

7

from the 25 percent limitation and on each occasion the

8

waiver has been granted.

9

Finally, while it has been stipulated that the

10

Fraternal Order of Police engages in the dissemination of

11

information and the advocacy of causes on the behalf of

12

police officers, there is no stipulation and the record

13

shows no connection between such activities and the

14

fundraising activities at which the Maryland statute is

15

directed.

16

The basis upon which —

17

QUESTION:

Ms. Motz, may I ask you whether it is

18

your position now that there are — Are there any limits

19

in your view on the circumstances in which the exemption

20

is available to a charity?

21

MS. MOTZ:

Yes, ma'am.

I believe, Justice

22

O'Connor, there are limits.

23

only available, as it says in the statute, when the

24

charity can show that without the exemption, with the

25

limitation, contributions would — I don't have exactly

In our view, the exemption is

1

the words of the statute here, but in those instances

2

which the limitation would effectively prevent the

3

charitable organization from raising contributions.

4

In our view and in practice before the

5

Secretary, it is an economic determination.

6

has in front of her the case that the charity makes that

7

the need the exemption for economic reasons.

8
9

The Secretary

Now, there are any number of economic reasons
for which the charity has granted the exemption, a new

10

organization, an organization with new activities, an

11

organization with a new program, an organization that

12

wants to pursue a program in a different way, a one-time

13

or extraordinary expense, any one of those kinds of

14

things, but they are all economically grounded.

15

QUESTION:

May I ask what that means,

16

effectively prevent from raising contributions?

17

mean they couldn't raise any contributions or they would

18

raise less money without the limitation?

said, which, it seems to me, is absolutely true, that the

regulations can go no further than the statute and it is a

matter that this Court and, indeed, every court I am

familiar with has ever held.

MS. MOTZ:

That is right, Justice Powell.

QUESTION:

Will you tell me about some of the

normal administrative expenses.

What about salaries of

Could you give some illustration?

Printing is not included.
MS. MOTZ:

Printing of materials that are mailed

16

is not included.

17

The cost of telephone solicitors is included.

Printing of other materials is included.

18

QUESTION:

What about radio?

19

MS. MOTZ:

Radio cost, advertising cost, yes,

20

sir, all of those are limited by the exemption — by the

21

limitation.

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

23

MS. MOTZ:

But, none of what would be thought of

24

as administrative costs, attorney's fees, bookkeeping, the

25

salaries of people that are at headquarters, researchers,

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

none of that is touched by the Maryland statute.

2

QUESTION:

What if the organization just hired a

3

fundraiser and the fundraisesr charges a fee or per­

4

centage?

5

I suppose that would be covered.
MS. MOTZ:

That would be covered, Justice White,

6

except if the fundraiser was doing a feasibility or pre­

7

planning study, the professional fundraiser.

8

doing that kind of study, that expense is expressly

9

excluded from the fundraising limitation.

MS. MOTZ:

Of the United Fund, for example, the

QUESTION:

— where you raise money for somebody

21

22
23
24
25

and you don't charge any fee, but your expense accounts
run about twice what you raise?
MS. MOTZ:

I don't think that problem — Well,

if all that this person does —
QUESTION:

You evidently don't have some of the

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

sharp ones around here then.

2

(Laughter)

3

MS. MOTZ:

Well, I don't suggest, Justice

4

Marshall, that this statute covers every problem.

5

if that person is only working on soliciting con­

6

tributions, then the expense account money would, indeed,

7

be covered by this limitation.

8

in the central staff office on administration, his expense

9

account would not be.

10

QUESTION:

I think

If that person is working

Let's assume in this case there was a

11

specific case for an exemption which was denied and then

12

this suit is brought.

13

interest in enforcing this statute is sufficient to

14

override whatever First Amendment interest there is here.

15
16

MS. MOTZ:

I suppose you would say the State's

Well, in point of fact, we don't

have — We don't have any showing here —

17

QUESTION:

I know.

I said, let's assume, let's

18

assume, assume there is no overbreadth issue whatsoever,

19

just that this charity says this is what it does to me.

20

And, I would suppose your position has to be that the

21

State's interest in that is sufficient to warrant the

22

statute.

23

MS. MOTZ:

Well, Justice White, if we assume

24

further that the group that is denied the waiver is an

25

advocacy organization, then I think we — I don't

statute is applied to some advocacy groups would be

MS. MOTZ:

I am saying —

10

QUESTION:

If an exemption were forbidden or if

11

there was a prosecution for raising money without a permit

of some advocacy organizations, the statute would be

MS. MOTZ:

I am not sure of that, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION:

I think that may be possible.
Well, you are not — I take it then

17

we should judge the case as though that were the case,

18

unless you want to take a position on it.

19

MS. MOTZ:

Let me try to articulate my position

20

on it.

21

is there has been no showing here.

22

unlikely that this statute is ever going to be applied

23

unconstitutionally against any group.

24
25

I think the position I would take, Justice White,

QUESTION:

I think it is highly

Well, you say that you can imagine

some advocacy groups which would — to which the statute

MS. MOTZ:

No, sir.

I thought that I was taking

QUESTION:

All right, I will take that.

take that.

without the permit they cannot raise money.

QUESTION:

On your submission then we must

assume that in some circumstances the statute could not be
constitutionally applied.
MS. MOTZ:

I think that one can assume here, as

one did in Broadrick, that it is possible the statute may
have a limited number of impermissible contributions.

How do you avoid the overbreadth

argument then?

mechanistic way and not look at the true and substantial

differences between this case and Schaumburg.

holding does not require invalidation of the Maryland

1

substantial, significant differences between the statute

2

we have here and the ordinance in Schaumburg.

3

most obvious one is that while the Schaumburg ordinance

4

was a direct regulation of door-to-door solicitation,

5

conduct which has been recognized as often so intertwined

6

with advocacy as to be protected under the First Amend­

7

ment .

10

Perhaps the

The Maryland statute is not directed to
door-to-door solicitation, but rather at charitable fund­
raising expenses.

11

Fundraising, as you know, may be conducted in a

12

variety of ways that has nothing to do with advocacy like

13

dances, garden tours, bingo games, things like this, and,

14

of course, the entertainment shows which are the

15

speciality of the Respondent here.

16

Now, true, fundraising may include solicitation

intertwined with advocacy.

getting at earlier.

19

any solicitation intertwined with advocacy has been or

20

will be or is likely to be threatened by the Maryland

21

statute or that any group engaging in any solicitation

22

intertwined with advocacy has even needed to apply for a

23

waiver from the fundraising limitation, let alone been

24

denied one.

25

This is the point we were

But, there is no showing here that

The second important difference, I think,

1

between the statute and the ordinance in Schaumburg is the

2

situation I was discussing with Justice Powell as few

3

minutes ago and that is the fact that the Schaumburg

4

ordinance limited a charity to — limited its adminis­

5

trative as well as fundraising expenses; that is general

6

staff salary, rents, telephones, attorney's fees.

7

those general expenses were limited by the Schaumburg

8

ordinance as well as fundraising expenses.

All of

\

9

The Maryland statute does not attempt to limit

10

the administrative expenses, rather it attempts to strike

11

at the heart of the problem of excessive fundraising

12

without unduly intruding into the internal affairs of a

13

charitable organization by limiting only fundraising

14

expenses.

15

Thirdly, the Schaumburg ordinance required a

18

charity, prior to any solicitation, to obtain a permit and

17

in order to obtain the permit the charity had to prove

18

that at least 75 percent of its income in the previous

19

year had been used directly for charitable purposes, thus,

20

there was no way a charity could, in the words of this

21

Court, alter its spending patterns in the short term to

22

comply with the 75 percent requirement.

23

The Maryland statute imposes neither of these

24

serious burdens on a charity.

25

a charity to prove compliance with the percentage

First, it does not require

limitation prior to engaging in fundraising activities.
And, second, the Maryland statute allows a

3

charity to apply the limitation retrospectively on an

4

annual or a campaign-by-campaign basis.

5

short run, a charity can, indeed, alter its spending

6

patterns to comply with the Maryland statute.

So that even in a

Fourth, the Schaumburg ordinance flatly bans the

8

solicition by charities that spent more than a certain

9

percentage on non-program expenses.

10

In contrast, the Maryland statute simply

11

subjects expenses in excess of the percentage limitation

12

to scrutiny.

13

effectively prevents it from raising funds, it can obtain

14

a complete exemption from the waiver, something that was

simply impossible under the Schaumburg ordinance.

QUESTION:

Why would not such a blanket

requirement of disclosure, whenever over 25 percent is

used for administrative expenses, why would that not

adequately serve the State's interest in avoiding fraud?

12

MS. MOTZ:

Well, I think there are two reasons,

Justice Stevens.

14

most persuasive to us is that I am not just sure that

disclosure works.

12

solicitor paid at a minimum wage rate whose in the same

situation, although for different reasons, and it is the

14

charities themselves who have almost across-the-board — I

15

notice they don't say it in their amici briefs to this

16

Court, but they have, for example, testified before the

17

Maryland General Assembly that disclosure requirements,

18

point of solicitation disclosure requirements raise more

19

questions than they answer and, therefore, put an undue

20

burden on the charity and don't give the public the real

Finally, it is the State's position that the

5

court below not only erred in failing to recognize the

6

substantive differences between the ordinance struck down

7

in Schaumburg and the statute involved here, but it also

8

failed to apply the correct test of validity, the test

9

that was applied by this Court in Schaumburg, the sub­

10

11

stantial overbreadth test.
In Schaumburg this Court held the ordinance bad

12

because it constituted a substantial limitation on

13

protected activity.

14

Schaumburg, this Court has reiterated the test of sub­

15

stantiality in New York versus Ferber where it said that a

16

statute would be stricken as overbroad under the First

17

Amendment only if it were shown to have a substantial

18

number of impermissible applications.

19

Subsequent to the decision in

There is no showing in this case that the

20

any impermissible applications.

So, what do we say — If we agree

with you, what do we say about the conclusion of the Court

MS. MOTZ:

I think what you say is — While in

21

Schaumburg it was likely, it was almost inevitable.

22

Indeed, this Court found it was a group to which this

24

is impossible, particularly with the waiver provision, to

ever find that about this statute; that there is a group

First, if I may, let me say that notwithstanding
the remarks contained in the reply brief filed by the

the state doesn't have a right to regulate in this area,

Schaumburg case.

I don't think it needs rearguing.

I

think your findings in the Schaumburg case were quite
clear.
I would submit to you that if you look at the
statute in the Schaumburg case, that is that portion of it
which sets up in that case 75 percent formula, and in the

case of the State of Maryland, the 25 exemption, I think

2

you will find them substantially the same.

3

some allocations of costs slightly different, but their

4

instrusiveness on First Amendent rights are almost equal

5

and I say the word "almost," because it is my contention

that the Maryland statute is not, in fact, less intrusive

of First Amendment rights, but, in fact, more intrusive of

8

First Amendment rights.

MR. GOLDBERG:

Even 90, yes, sir.

In fact, you

raise a point that was raised in the court below when it

was asked of me suppose 90 percent was the determinative

13

Why do I say that?

Because the purpose of these

statutes, all of them, the Schaumburg statute, by the

15

evidence of counsel here this morning, this statute, they

are designed to help prevent fraud.

9

Certainly a state can regulate the

MR. GOLDBERG:

Isn't that so?

Your Honor, that is so, but I

10

don't think it is applicable in the area in First Amend­

11

ment and freedom of speech.

12

QUESTION:

But, what if a state said that we

13

think literary agents are just getting too much money from

14

authors, so we are going to forbid any literary agent from

collecting more than 10 percent by way of a commission

16

from an author's royalties on a book?

*\7

Now, supposing you

could make all the showing that the agent had been getting

kind of grabby, the same sort of thing you make for an

under the Constitution with that statute?

What do you think would be the

MR. GOLDBERG:

I frankly, Your Honor, would feel

intrusion into the right to deal freely in business in the

absence of any suggestion of fraud or wrongdoing.

QUESTION:

We have

If that analysis is true, the cases

10

of holding of regulation on employment agency fees must be

11

wrong if it is just a market place analysis.

12

MR. GOLDBERG:

Your Honor, I don't stand before

13

this Court and suggest that I would be a sage in

14

suggesting that I would agree or disagree with all past

15

holdings of this Court or any other court and hope that

16

what my position is with respect to a particular issue is

17

the correct one.

18

I address myself to those issues this morning

19

that have to do with a statute which is baldly on its face

20

overly broad and that it reaches out and sweeps in

21

organizations who have a right of freedom of speech and

22

presentation.

23

We are dealing with a percentage statute and I

24

know the statement that I have made in response to the

25

Chief Justice's statement is a rather strong one, but,
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

nonetheless, when you are talking about First Amendment

2

rights, I think it has been the tradition of this Court to

3

be very, very strong in its protection of those rights.

4

I would suggest that not only is the statute in

5

Maryland stronger than that — stronger in the sense that

6

it violates First Amendment rights to a greater extent.

7

If you compare the Village of Schaumburg

8

statute, it only really related to door-to-door

9

solicitations, though the court didn't rest its opinion on

10

the door-to-door permit requirement.

11

In the Maryland statute, may I draw your

12

attention to the fact that the solicitation is any form of

13

solicitation, whether it be by radio broadcast, whether it

14

be by telephone, whether it be by mail or whatever

15

media —

Maryland wasn't attempting to tell
It wasn't addressing specific methods

19

But, going back to your statement that the state

20

has a constitutional authority to regulate, could you give

21

some examples of what you think would be reasonable or

22

constitutional regulations?

23

MR. GOLDBERG:

Certainly, Your Honor.

I don't

24

have the statute here before me, but I am quite sure it is

25

the statute which is in effect in Indiana that I had

occasion to take a look at which is a very strict dis­

closure statute which requires an organization to present

3

a statement of its financial affairs in connection with

4

all contributions made to it.

5

I would further suggest to the Court that as

many, many, very, very strong penal statutes that can be

drawn, and some have been drawn already, which deal with

fraud.

obtain, to expend the monies necessary to effectively

6

publish, I would suppose, in a local paper on a weekly

7

basis might be in itself such a heavy obligation as to be

8

prohibitive.

9

On the other hand, to require an organization to

10

give out to a perspective donor a statement of what it has

done with its money, I see no problem with that

whatsoever.

realm for a state to so regulate and doesn't on its face,

14

at any rate, appear that there would result in any

15

infringement of First Amendment rights.

Well, how much publication would you

have to give?

QUESTION:

I mean on your statement — You have

just said it would be perfectly all right to compel them

22

to make a public disclosure.

23

MR. GOLDBERG:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. GOLDBERG:

Is that what you said?

Yes, sir.

How often and how detailed?
Your Honor, I wouldn't suggest

states, publish this information as a public service on

My question

7

is the statute compels the organization to disclose it.

8

You said you agreed with that.

MR. GOLDBERG:

10

11
12

QUESTION:

Yes, I do.

Well, how often, once every thousand

years?
MR. GOLDBERG:

No, sir, absolutely not.

I would

13

suggest, Your Honor, if you had such a statute, that if

14

they were compelled to forward a copy of their financial

15

statement of the preceding year, I think that would

16

certainly be fair and adequate.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. GOLDBERG:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

I thought you said to the public.
Sir?

I thought you said they could be

compelled to report to the public not some agency.
MR. GOLDBERG:

If they were compelled to report

22

to the public, Your Honor, I would suggest that once a

23

year would not be unreasonable.

24
25

QUESTION:

In how much detail?

For example,

unlimited expense accounts, would that be included?

MR. GOLDBERG:

Your Honor, I honestly can't

2

address that to you, because how detailed a statute — a

3

state ultimately comes —

4

QUESTION:

You really didn't mean what you said,

5

to give it to the public, did you?

6

to the public on your terms.

I have seen statutes such as the Indiana

10

statute which requires the information to be given at the

11

time a solicitation is made and a donor agrees to give

12

money.

That would appear to me —
QUESTION:

Did you ever look at the New York

statute?

QUESTION:

Did you ever look at the New York

statute?

MR. GOLDBERG:

QUESTION:

20

No, sir, I have not.

I don't know how you ever got to the

Indiana one.

21

(Laughter)

22

MR. GOLDBERG:

23

Sir?

Well, it was forwarded to me,

Your Honor, if the Court please.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. GOLDBERG:

Oh!
And, I would take a few moments

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

at this time to further try to distinguish the two

2

statutes.

3

It is our position that, of course, the Maryland

4

statute is truly overbroad and stands foursquare along

5

side that statute in the Schaumburg case and it is our

6

position —

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldberg, what about the

8

exemptions that are allowed under the Maryland statute.

9

Isn't that a substantial difference?

10

MR. GOLDBERG:

Thank you, Justice O'Connor.

I

11

was just coming to that very point and I would suggest to

12

you that these or this "limited exemptions" provision

13

doesn't cleanse this statute of any overbreadth.

14

this exemption further burdens this statute to a point

15

that I would suggest is, based on the law of this Court in

16

the past, is just totally unacceptable.

17
18
19

In fact,

It leaves a clear-cut discretion in the hands of
the Secretary of the State of Maryland.
You know, they can say as frequently as they

20

might like that we have given 14 exceptions.

21

has to do is come in and apply.

22

been done today and that is what was done yesterday.

23

what we don't know is and what we cannot allow to be

24

speculated upon is what is going to be done tomorrow.

25

Perhaps tomorrow an organization will come in who is not

All someone

Well, that is what has

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

But,

1

particularly favored by this particular Secretary of State

2

and then we go —

3

QUESTION:

But, you say the Maryland Statute

4

would be fine under Schaumburg if the exemption provision

5

set forth some standards.

6

MR. GOLDBERG:

Your Honor, I would suggest to

7

this Court that any attempt at curing the overbreadth by

8

way of an exemption provision, which in itself leaves a

9

discretion in the administrative body, that is a secretary

10

of state or other administraive officers, not withstanding

11

that there may be an appeal to a judicial body, is no less

12

offensive, in fact, perhaps more offensive of First

13

Amendment Rights as anything could possible be, because

14

you are talking about leaving discretion — I refer now to

15

Justice Rehnquist's dissent in the Schaumburg case in

16

which he so eloquently pointed out that it is almost

17

academic that if you have a First Amendment right involved

18

you cannot have discretion.

19

The Maryland courts have interpreted the statute

20

which, as the Court pointed out earlier, the State

21

unfortunately is bound with, that it is much too narrow so

22

that it does not at all clear up the issue of overbreadth

23

which is so terribly apparent in the other portion of the

24

statute.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldberg, may I ask you a

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

question right there?

2

MR. GOLDBERG:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

If your position is the statute is

4

overbroad and the exemption doesn’t help, I take it you

5

are arguing that even if you had applied for an exemption

6

and you had received the exemption and you were able to

7

solicit on behalf of this organization, you would still

8

have this lawsuit that you would be able to maintain?

9

MR. GOLDBERG:

10

QUESTION:

I am sorry, sir, I didn't hear.

You would still make your overbreadth

11

attack on this statute even if you had applied for an

12

exemption and obtain an exemption, is that correct?

13

MR. GOLDBERG:

14

QUESTION:

15

Of course.

Why didn't you ask for an exemption

then?

16

MR. GOLDBERG:

Because, Your Honor, we didn't

17

feel that the statute was constitutional.

18

that —

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

We didn't feel

But, you wouldn't have lost your

right to challenge it.
MR. GOLDBERG:

That is very true, Your Honor,

but then again —
QUESTION:

You might have been able to solicit

in the meantime.
MR. GOLDBERG:

You don't have to — When a

chilling effect which gives us the right to come in and

test these statutes.

QUESTION:

I understand all that, but it doesn't

explain to me why you wouldn't have applied for the

exemption.

15

curious.

16

Maybe you don't have to, but I am just kind of

MR. GOLDBERG:

Well, Your honor, we didn't apply

17

for the exemption, because frankly, sir, we didn't feel we

18

had to.

19

was unconstitutional, and, therefore, we did not apply for

20

the exemption on those grounds.

21

apply for that exemption, and, in fact, did not, no more

22

than one would have to apply for a permit when they were

23

out in the street canvassing books in connection with

24

particular types of religious beliefs.

25

We felt that the statute was wrong, the statute

We weren't required to

I believe, if my memory serves me, a case comes

41

to mind, the Cantwell case — No, a more recent case, the

2

Hynes case versus Oradell.

3

sought a permit, but he didn't.

4

and solicited for his particular campaign because that

5

statute, he felt, was overly broad and facially uncon­

6

stitutional and, therefore, he wasn't required to do so.

7

And, Your Honor, that is exactly the position in this

8

particular matter.

9

Mr. Hynes could have gone and
He went out door to door

Now, I think perhaps I have — by Your Honor's

10

questions — I have covered most of the ground that I

11

intended to try and cover here this morning.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldberg, may I ask a question?

13

MR. GOLDBERG:

14

QUESTION:

Certainly, sir.

The stipulation states that the

15

Fraternal Order of Police that you represent is engaged in

16

advocating causes.

17

Orders of Police and in my State of Virginia they serve

18

their useful purpose.

19

your client —

20

I am generally familiar with the

MR. GOLDBERG:

Tell me specifically what causes

Well, Your Honor, the Fraternal

21

Order of Police has evolved in the past two years, I would

22

suppose, in as much as a voice of the police officers in

23

connection with work-related activities that is almost in

24

the form of a union chapter, if you will, expressing

25

the views of the police officers as to working conditions,

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

as to benefits that might be obtainable by them, and in an

2

area that is terribly important —

3
4

QUESTION:

So the cause is to improve employment

conditions of police?

5

MR. GOLDBERG:

Not entirely, Your Honor.

Also,

6

they spend a good deal of time in connection with the

7

field of relations between the Police Department and the

8

public establishing better relationships,

9

together so that the police officer is not looked upon as

working

10

this onerous person in a blue uniform, but really as he

11

had been looked upon in years gone by.

Yes, Your Honor, that is another

QUESTION:

Tell me this.

Do you have to file

any report at all of how the money is expended?

6

MR. GOLDBERG:

As of this time, whether or not

7

the Montgomery County Chapter has filed such report, I

8

cannot answer, because —

9

QUESTION:

I am asking about Maryland law.

10

MR. GOLDBERG:

11

QUESTION:

12

Sir?

Does Maryland law require the filing

of any report to anyone?

13

MR. GOLDBERG:

I can tell you that my client,

14

the Respondent, the Munson organization, has not filed

15

such a report.

16
17

QUESTION:

But you don't know what Maryland law

provides?

18

MR. GOLDBERG:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GOLDBERG:

21

As to the filing of a report?

Yes.
Absolutely I do.

The filing of a

report —

22

QUESTION:

I am not talking about this statute.

23

I am thinking, for example, about reports that

24

corporations have to file, certain corporations that have

25

listed stock, that disclose their assets and liabilities

and their income each year and a vast amount of informa­

2

tion.

3

that is a stated issue, any report of any kind is required

4

to be filed by a charitable organization?

5

no?

I was wondering whether, in Maryland, for example,

6

MR. GOLDBERG:

Is the answer

Well, Your Honor, the answer — I

7

am not saying the answer is no, but what I am saying is

8

that I am not familiar with it.

9

QUESTION:

10

You don't know.

MR. GOLDBERG:

I do know that under the statute

11

which we have here before us there is a requirement of

12

filing of complete financial information, yes.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GOLDBERG:

15

QUESTION:

Would you object to that?
No, absolutely not.

And, do you know, for example, what

16

percentage of the funds raised by your client go to the

17

direct benefit of police who are needy or otherwise need

18

the money?

19

MR. GOLDBERG:

20

QUESTION:

Sir, I am —

I am thinking about the distinction

21

between advocating causes and providing relief for needy

22

policemen.

23

MR. GOLDBERG:

Your Honor, I don't know what the

24

variation is, what the percentage is between how much goes

25

to the policeman who is incapacitated and how much goes to

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the public relations or just where the line is or what

2

percentage on what part of the line.
QUESTION:

3

So, you are not able to tell us with

4

any figures or even with any rough estimates as to what

5

extent this organization is a cause advocacy organization?

6

I am talking now in terms of percent of money raised.

7

MR. GOLDBERG:

8

QUESTION:

MR. GOLDBERG:

If you don't know, just say so.

11

That is right.
No question about it, sir.

It is not?
It is not, sir, that is quite

correct.
But, I would suggest, Your Honor, that not only

does this statute reach advocacy organizations such as the

FPO, but reaches all advocacy organizations.

broadly that it sweeps into it all advocacy organizations

just as did the Schaumburg case and that the "limited

exception" or the exception limitation doesn't cleanse it

5

and once more, not only does it not cleanse it — Again, I

6

refer to Justice Rehnquist's dissent in the Schaumburg

7

case — it makes it worse, because it leaves discretion in

8

a place where discretion should be when you are testing

9

the constitutionality of a statute to the First Amendment

Our whole position is that this statute sweeps so

standards.

It simply cannot be there.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DIANA G. MOTZ — Rebuttal
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. MOTZ:

I would like to make one point about

24

the interests that the State is asserting here and I feel

25

that I maybe unfortunately mislead the Court.
47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

The interests we are asserting here are somewhat

2

different, I think, than the interests that were asserted

3

in the Schaumburg case.

4

the Village asserted that defraud interest, and they

5

asserted that those people who spent more than 25 percent

6

on non-charity expenses were fraudulent in representing

7

themselves as a charity.

8
9

You will remember in Schaumburg,

The State of Maryland makes no such contention.
Indeed, what this statute is trying to reach is the use of

10

charitable contributions for non-charitable purposes,

11

something which may not necessarily be and which probably

12

in many instances is not criminal, fraudulent misrepre­

13

sentation under an ordinary fraud statute.

14

What it is, we submit, is something which

15

entitles the state to be on notice as to the activities of

16

the organization and to scrutinize those activities when

17

their fundraising expenses are more than 25 percent.

18

that is precisely what the Maryland statute does.

19

not asume that those activities are fraudulent.

20

does is assume that they are entitled to be scrutinized by

21

the state and if the charity makes a showing that, indeed,

22

those expenses are reasonable, it may go out and continue

23

to solicit provided it discloses that to the public.

24

if it does not make that showing then it is not entitled

25

to solicit.

And,

It does
What it

Of course, that decision goes to judicial
48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

And,

review.
We believe in that way, without imposing any

3

great burden on the charity, we have protected the

4

potential donor, the intended beneficiary, and we have, in

5

general, benefited charity by insuring the appearance as

6

well as the reality of integrity charitable organizations.

Thank you very much.
