ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD V. MORANO, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS,

9

APPOINTED EY THIS COURT

10
11

MR. MORANOs

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may

it please the Court, the issue before the Court is

12 whether petitioners as employees of a community-based,
13

non-profit corporation. United Neighborhoods,

14

Incorporated, UNI, constituted public officials

15

according to the bribery statute.

16

Since petitioners in their employment with

17

United Neighborhood, Incorporated, were not federal

18

employees, the only provision under which they could be

19

subject to the bribery statute would be as "persons

20

acting for or on behalf of the United States or any

21

department, agency, cr branch of government thereof, in

22

any official function, under or by the authority of any

23

department or agency or branch of the government.”

24
25

The legislative history establishes, however,
that petitioners cannot be subject to the bribery

3

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

statute under this provision.

2

United Neighborhoods, Incorporated,

3

officers or persons acting on behalf of a corporation

4

controlled by a department, agency, or branch of the

5

federal government.

First, as employees of
they were not

Second, petitioners did not have contracts

6
7

with a department, agency, cr branch of the federal

8

government, and therefore could not serve as agents in

9

performing the terms.
QUESTIONS

10
11

Did their agency, the local agency

have a contract with the United States government?
MB. MORANCs

12

The contract was between the city

13

of Peoria and the United States government.

14

contract was a community block grant, which was issued

15

in

16

employees of a subgrantee, this non-profit corporation,

17

United

18

The

1978 to the city of Peoria, and petitioners were

Neighborhoods, Incorporated.
Third and last, petitioners were not federal

19

inspectors licensed cr authorized by some department,

20

agency, or branch of the federal government to certify

21

or enforce standards established by law.

22

In looking at the legislative history of the

23

bribery statute, in 1962, the last time the bribery

24

statute was revised, Congress said that it was net

25

making any substantive changes in the statute in regard

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

to classes of persons subject to it, but merely was

2

consolidating under one statute what had heretofore been

3

13 different statutes.

4
5

But Congress also declared that it was
continuing to give the same broad interpretation of

6 public official and public act as found in case law.
7

Congress, however, had been prodded by the Court in this

8

Court’s 1920 decision, United States versus Strang,

9

make the bribery statute applicable in piecemeal fashion

to

10

to employees of government owned and controlled

11

corporations, such as, for instance, the Homeowners loan

12

Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance

13

Corpor ation .

14

And then, in the year 1948, Congress revised

15

the statute and inserted "or any department or agency

16

thereof" to embrace offices or persons acting on behalf

17

of any independent agencies or government owned or

18

controlled corporation.

19

I think two good examples of government owned

20

or controlled corporations would be the Federal Reserve

21

Banks which are depositories for currencies held in the

22

United States Treasury, and also fiscal and monetary

23

agents of the United States, and another example would

24

be the European Exchange System, which served as an

25

instrumentality of the United States government and the

5

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Department of the Army in operating exchanges at

2

European military posts.

3

Thus, what we can infer from these examples is

4

that a necessary condition of such a government

5

controlled corporation is that a department, agency, or

6

branch of the federal government exercise an ongoing

7

control, supervision, and direction of the operation of

8

the corporation.

9

between the corporation which is controlled and the

10

federal government.
One of the definitions given in Webster's

There is a symbotic relationship

QUESTIONS

4

Mr. Horano, is this argument

5

directed to the phrase in the statute "a person acting

6

for or on behalf of the United States?"
ME. MORANOs

7

Yes.

What I have argued, Justice

8

Eehnquist, is that in effect there really are three

9

rubrics under which someone could be deemed to act for

10

and on behalf of the United States in terms of

11

legislative history and case law which was given

12

approbation by the Congress in its 1962 statement.
And the three rubrics are that you have an

13
14

officer or employee of a government controlled

15

corporation, or —

1
2

MR. M0RAN0*

This one is acting on behalf of

these, you see.

3

QUESTION*

But are we talking about them?

The

4

statute is in the disjunctive, and you are right, in the

5

latter part it says, "or on behalf of any department,

6

agency, or branch of government thereof,” but before

7

that it says, "or on behalf of the United States," which

8

suggests to me that that phrase must mean something over

9

and above "any department, agency, or branch of

10

government."

Do you see what I mean?

MR. MORANOi

11

Yes, I understand what you are

12

saying.

13

-- I should perhaps state it in the disjunctive then,

14

that -- I can't think offhand of an example in which a

15

person would be acting on behalf of the government

16

unless they were some department, agency, or branch cf

17

the government involved.

18

I think I would put it in the — perhaps in the

QUESTION*

I mean, it is --

Well, I suppose the grain

19

inspectors are an example.

20

separate statute, but that is an example, is it not, of

21

someone acting for and on behalf of the government?

22

there other examples like the grain inspectors where

23

some state or local agency cr employee is designated by

24

law to be an agent of the federal government?

25

MR. MORANOs

They are covered by a

I think the grain inspector

Anyway, I would concede that it could be

5

6

understood in the disjunctive, certainly, that it could

7

be acting on the behalf of the United States or any

8

department, agency, or branch of the government, but

9

still, the three rubrics would be covered by that,

10

whether you understood it as in the disjunctive or

11

merely suplisage.
QUESTIONs

12

Mr. Morano, did the UNI do any of

13

the work itself in any occasion, or was it always a mere

14

conduit for the federal funds?
MR. MORANOs

15

It had no relationship whatsoever

16

with the federal government save for the federal source

17

of the funds.
QUESTIONS

18
19

Did it ever do any of the

rehabilitation work itself?
MR. MORANOs

work.

When the Nixon Administration in 1974 passed

2

the community block grant in response to the turmoil and

3

the lack of decent housing and the lack of other sources

4

of finances to improve this condition, the UNI -- they

5

received more than fl million, the city of Peoria

6

received more than $1 million in grants specifically

7

earmarked to work in that area, and then they

8

subcontracted the work out.

goals were general goals of the city, but UNI was to use

MR. HORANO;

Thank you. Justice Stevens.

I

didn't understand Justice O'Connor's question.
Granted the city of Peoria was required to

14

submit annual reports to HUD, and the Secretary of HDD

15

had the right to audit such community block grants and

16

to adjust, reduce, or withdraw such funds if the city

17

did not substantially comply with the terms of the

18

application of the requirements of the Act.

19

But according to the Act, once the city of

20

Peoria had received this community block grant, the

21

entire administration of the grant was left to it, and

22

HUD had absolutely no control over or right to

23

interefere with its administration.

24
25

So therefore what is decisive is that the
federal government had relinquished all control over the

10
11

QUESTION*

Do you think the Congress could

have authorized the federal agency itself in Washington

12 to go out and do all this community rehabilitation,
13 awarding the contracts directly through federal
14 employees?

wanted

17

Could they have done it that way if Congress

them to?

Any constitutional objection to it?

There might be a problem of -- I

the -- I haven’t thought that through, but my

18 guess might be that there might be a problem between —
19 of the — a dispute between the legislative and

20 executive branches of the government that this is -21

this sounds a little bit maybe too socialistic for the

22 usual way in which Congress operates.
23

QUESTION *

Well, in this instance, Congress

24

created an agency which was authorized by Congress tc

25

make grants in the communities and allow the grantee of

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

that community to carry out the rehabilitation of

2

housing.

Is that correct?

3

MR. MORANC.*

4

QUESTION*

Yes.
Well, then, wasn't everything that

5

was being done being done on behalf of the United

6

S tates ?
MR. MORANC*

7

I think that the history of the

8

Act shows that this would be giving too broad a scope to

9

acting on behalf of the United States.

Certainly the

10

United States had an interest, the United States had

11

given funds, but if we look at the Community Development

12

Act of

13

revenue sharing programs for better communities that

14

Nixon had initiated and the Congress had gone along with

15

him on. Congress found critical problems facing the

16

cities which it hoped to alleviate by enlisting the

17

support of the local groups.

1974, which was a continuation of the federal

i

The emphasis was upon the initiative of the

18
19

community to tailor a program which was suitable for it

20

in its unique situation.
QUESTION*

21

The initiative began with the local

22

community asking the federal government for some money,

23

and then the federal government gave the money, so that

24

it was entirely paid for by the federal government, was

25

it not?

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

HR. MORANO;

Yes, Justice, it was entirely

paid for by the federal government,
QUESTION;

Then on the second -- on the

disjunctive aspect of what Justice Rehnquist read to
you, isn't all this conduct by these people being done
on behalf of the United States?
NR. MORANO:

I don't think, Justice Burger, in

terms of the legislative history of these words, that we
should give such a broad construction —
QUESTION;

Well, let's forget about the

legislative history and see whether the language of the
statute is clear.

If it is clear, we don't need to look

at the history, do we?
MR. MORANO;

That's true. Justice.

I do not

think that the — that use of language on behalf of
someone suggests — is suggested by the fact that
someone has an interest in the results. and that someone
is paying for what is being done.
The statute says clearly that what is
anticipated is the consolidated efforts of city, state,
and local governmental bodies, the continuation of
business investments, et cetera, so that the "on behalf
of the United States," if we gave this strong
interpretation, any time we had federal funds — excuse
me?

MR. MOFANOs

As I have tried to delineate with

these government controlled corporations, UNI does not

10

qualify as a governmlent controlled corporation;

11

however, audits were regularly allowed by the Secretary

12

of HUD, and if there is a misuse of the funds, then

funds can be adjusted, withdrawn, or reduced in terms of

interests of Congress in these, but when it comes to a

criminal statute, if there is any ambiguity, and I

20

maintain that there is ambiguity in what it means to act

on behalf of someone else, that if we were to say that

any time one handles funds that have been derived from

to me that that would be a reasonable Interpretation of

2

what Congress had intended.
So that I think that in view of the fact that

3
4

we — to understand a plain meaning, we not only have to

5 construe the words "acting for or on behalf of the
6

United States in any official function,” but we also

7

have to look to a further restriction, and the further

8 restriction is under or by authority of some department,
9

agency, or branch of the government thereof.
And it seems to me that there is — it would

10

be rather far-fetched to say that these employees who
2

were doing day to day tasks assigned to them by their

3 superiors in United Neighborhoods, Incorporated, are
4

acting under or by the authority of HDD, or under or by

5

authority of the city of Peoria, let alone HUD.
The Congress, when it drafted the statute,

6
7

didn't predicate the statute in terms of the source of

8

the funds.

9

In the government brief, they —
QUESTIONi

Hr. Horano, you are now referring

20

to the section of the statute that speaks of under or by

2

authority of any such department, agency, or branch cf

22

government, and then you go back — if you go back

23

earlier in the statute, within the same subparagraph,

24

the language there,

"any department, agency, or branch

acting for or on behalf of the United States."

2

the bottom of Page 1 of your blue brief.

3

I think one could make the argument that the

4

language you are now relying on, "under or by

5

authority," modifies only the phrase "any department,

6

agency, or branch of government," and not "a person

7

acting on behalf of the United States."

8

with that?

9

SB. MOBANOs

Do you disagree

I would think so, but I wonder if

10

it makes any difference in this case, because obviously

11

if these people were acting on behalf of — if they were

12

public officials, they would be so because of the

13

connection through HUD, and so therefore it is a

14

department of the federal government, and therefore, if

15

they are going to be public officials, it would be under

16

or by authority of the Department of HUD.

17

not, it seems to me, what is the case here.

18

*

It is at

And this is

I think that the government in its brief says

19

that it is hard to imagine how Congress could have

20

expressed more vividly its intention to cover persons

21

administering federal programs, and I think in the very

22

posing of the question it answers itself, for if

23

Congress had intended that there be federal jurisdiction

24

under the bribery statute for all cases of alleged fraud

25

by persons administering federally funded programs, all

it would have had to have done would have been to have

2

drafted a statute stating just that.

3

such.

But it didn't do

4

It seems that the principle of lenity and the

5

principle of federalism adds strength to this position.

6 The principle of lenity that in a criminal statute, if
7

there is any ambiguity whatsoever, if there is genuine

8 ambiguity -- I shouldn't say any ambiguity whatsoever —
9

but if there is a genuine ambiguity, the narrower

10

construction is mandated, and it seems to me that the

11

most one can say is that there is some doubt about

12 Congressional intent about the language.

And therefore the narrower construction seems

13
14

mandated.

In addition, since we have here not merely a

15

criminal statute but a federal criminal statute, we also

16

have problems of comity and federalism, that the area of

17 criminal law is generally, absent a national or
18

constitutional issue, left to the jurisdiction of the

19 states.

ORAL ARGUMENT CF RICHARD G. WILKINS, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

11

MR. WILKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12

please the Court, the United States has just a few brief

13

points tc make.

14

presented by this case is indeed readily resolved.

20
21

At the outset a few facts, I believe, are
necessary to put this question in its proper

22 perspective.

‘

Petitioners were the executive director

23

and housing rehabilitation coordinator of United

24

Neighborhoods, Incorporated, a public or a non-profit

25

public corporation that was designed to perform varicus

functions.

One of these was the distribution of federal

2

housing funds obtained front the federal government

3

through the city of Peoria under the Housing and

4

Community Development Act of 1974.
As detailed in our brief, United

5

6

Neighborhoods* use of these funds and petitioners'

7

administration of these funds was subject to a whole

8

host of federal substantive and procedural regulations.

9

The federal government designed the program, set forth

10

what activities UNI could undertake, set forth how the

11

funds were to be managed and administered.

12

Indeed, although the petitioners say the

13

federal government relinquished control over these

14

funds,

the legislative reports on the *72 -- on the

*74

15 legislation state unequivocally that Congress provided
16

extensive executive oversight "to ensure that federal

17

funds are being used efficiently to achieve national

18

objectives."

19

Therefore, this was not a mere local project,

20

but rather, as UNI itself stated in its application for

21

federal housing funds, it proposed to undertake "a joint

22

effort with the city of Peoria to achieve the common

23

goals as set forth in the Housing and Community

24

Development Act."

25

Information Act question, the Court took a different

approach and said that grants of federal funds generally

recipient, and they don't convert the acts of the

recipient from private acts to governmental acts, and so

MR. WILKINS:

8
9

though

Certainly, that -- perhaps,

— you have to look at the underlying goals of

10

the different statutes involved also.

I think when you

11

understand or when you consider that the underlying goal

12 of federal bribery law is to protect the public from the
13

evils of corruption in public service, the statute must

14

be broad enough, must be construed broadly enough to

15

deal with that concern, and the legislative history of

this statute, as I hope to detail in a few moments -QUESTIONi

17

One last question while I have you

19

MR. WILKINS:

20

QUESTION:

Sure.

Would Congress have needed to even

21

pass a statute expressly covering, for example, the

22

grain inspectors under your interpretation of this

23

statute?

24
25

MR. WILKINS:

No, indeed they don't.

In fact,

Mr. Wilkins, is your argument, in a

control over who got so-called "federal funds?"

19

MR. WILKINS;

They had substantial control

over who would receive the benefits of a federal housing

rehabilitation program.

22

QUESTION;

Now, you say the

But aren't you then saying that the

2

MR. WILKINS;

3

QUESTIONS

Exactly.

I see, so if there were a blanket

4

authority to make all the decisions, he would not be

5

acting on behalf of the authority, but if there is a

6 limited authority to make decisions, he is.
MR. WILKINS;

7

It seems --

That is right, because if the

8

federal government has limited your authority and said

9

you can do A, B, and C, but not D, when you do A, B, and

10

C, then you are acting on behalf of the United States.

Now, what about the building

contractor letting a subcontract to an electrician?

6

MR. WILKINS;

Now, that, in certain

circumstances, that circumstance could be followed.

There is a case cited in our brief, the Raff case — it

9

is rather old, I think, 20 years old — where you had an

architect that was hired to build an Air Force base, and

11

as part of his — he was bribed tc hand out cr to net

12

inspect certain work by subcontractors, et cetera, and

13

he was held liable under the bribery statute.
QUESTION;

14

But your submission to us today is

15

that not only the employees of UNI but the employees of

the general contractors with whom UNI contracted are

also within the federal bribery statute?

R3. WILKINSi

2

The — Yes, it was.

I will

3

digress for a minute and handle the legislative history

4

at this point, because it dees seem of some concern.

5 This statute was amended for perhaps — well, several
6

times,

but one time in 1948 Congress expressly amended

7

the statute and kind of broadened the language even

8 further in response to this Court’s decision in United
9

States versus Strang, which had held on the basis of

10 familiar agency principles that an employee of a
11

government controlled corporation did not come within

12 the conflict of interest statute because he wasn’t an
13

agent of the United States.
Congress at that point, when it adopted this

14

15 language in 1948, in the legislative report said, we
16

mean to overcome the holding in Strang.

In a vain attempt to avoid the plain language

2

of this statute, petitioners, although it is undisputed

3

that in the course of their administration of these

4

funds they solicited and accepted $42,000 in return for

5

their awarding particular contractors federal housing

6

contracts, they argue that they were not acting in an

7

official function or acting under or by authority of a

8

branch

9

of the government.
This argument, as I have already detailed to

10

some extent, is unavailing, because in performing the

11

function of awarding federally funded housing

12

rehabilitation contracts for purposes contemplated by

13

federal law, they were clearly performing an important

14

official function.

15

the regulations promulgated by HUD, and they were

16

therefore acting under or by direction of that agency.

17

They could only do so according to

The legislative history, moreover, supports

18

this construction.

19

the legislative history of the statute demonstrates

20

unequivocally that Congress intended to reach out

21

broadly to include all persons who perform official

22

functions on behalf of the United States.

23

As I went through a few moments ago,

And finally, and perhaps most importantly, the

24

federal policies underlying federal bribery law clearly

25

demonstrate the petitioners should fall within the

36

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

definition of public official.

The purpose of a federal

2 bribery law is, of course, to protect the public against
3

the corruption — or the evils of corruption in public

4

service.
The power that was used corruptly by

5
6

petitioners in this case is an important governmental

7 power.
8

It is critical to the success of the Housing and

Community Development Act programs that the authority to
determine who receives federal contracts not be

10
11

corrupted by bribery.
QUESTION*

Mr. Wilkins, may I turn to another

12

area that keeps running through my mind? There are a lot

13

of federal grant programs where money goes to state

14

agencies and cities, and the states and the cities

15

administer the funds themselves pursuant to federal

16

regulations and the like.

17

local officials 'who administer those programs subject to

18

federal bribery statutes?

ME. WILKINS*

Are the various state and

They may well indeed be subject

20

to federal bribery statutes.

There was a case in

21

district court out -- it is a district court case out of

22

New Mexico as cited in our brief, the Gallegos case,

23

where the state of New Mexico hired a state employee to

24

administer an assistance program set up by the FHA

25

Administration to assist farmers.

He was a state

employee, but his only function was to assist the

2

implementation of this federal program, and he was held

3

to be within the reach.

4

Now, again, I don’t believe this raises any

5

substantial concerns regarding an undue broad sweep for

6

this statute because in any —

QUESTIONS

Well,

I am thinking of situations,

8

and we recently had this Panhurst case reargued in which

9

there was a state program for care of the mentally ill,

10

which is partially financed by federal funds, and the

11

grant is subject to all sorts of regulation, and the

12

state officials were doing their normal state duties but

13

are also carrying out a federal function.

14
15

I gather under your theory it would still be
subject to this statute.

16

Yes.

QUESTIONi

— but you say it is a kind of a

mixed function, both federal and otherwise at the same
time.
HR. WILKINS;

In fiscal year 1983, the federal

government has appropriated over fh billion into the
housing program that was administered by petitioners.
It is essential to the proper administration of this
undeniably federal program that the federal government
be able to take the steps necessary, including criminal
prosecutions for bribery —

It cuts off some place before the

4

SR. WILKINS:

Yes.

It cuts off at any point

5

that someone ceases to do an official function on behalf

6

of the United States.
QUESTION:

7

Well, this man is furnishing

8

electric wire to the subcontractor who is working for

9

the contractor who you say is directly under the federal

10

government.

Well, is he covered or not?

11

HR. WILKINS:

12

QUESTION:

13

HR. WILKINS:

In — if there --

Where do you draw the line?
It would depend on some

14

attendant facts.

large military base.

not to look carefully at his work or inspect carefully

18

his work.

19

For example, the Raff case cited in

He was bribed by subcontractors

That contractor was bribed.
New, as you move further down the steps, I

20

guess it would depend whether or not, at any given step,

21

whether the subcontractor could be said to exercise seme

22

sort of official authority that would fall back on the

23

federal fisc.

24

example, could chose wire from one distributor or

25

another, and the cost of that wire would go directly to

How about in Medicaid and Medicare

How far do you take it there?
MB. WILKINS:

7

In the Medicaid and Medicare, I

\

8 am not terribly familiar with the legislative scheme or
9

statutory scheme for those programs.

I would believe it

10

would be handled similarly to the CETA case, the Mosely

11

case.

If the person has direct control for the

13 federal funds, and he had the ability to make that sort
14

of controlling decision, and the impact of that decision

15

fell back on the federal government, on the federal

16

taxpayers, I think you would say in that circumstance

17

that he was exercising an official function.

18

20

QUESTION;

Again —

So the doctors and pharmacists and

so forth are all covered?
MR. WILKINS:

I am not sure whether you would

21

go clear down to the pharmacists and all sorts of lower

22

level echelons.

23

at least if you read the newspapers, you are aware that

24

there is substantial graft and corruption in the

25

administration of those programs.

In this circumstance, we are aware, or

we, the government, submits should be interpreted

2

broadly enough to reach anyone who has — exercises any

3

sort of official function in the administration of that

4

program and does so corruptly.

5

The language of Section 201(a), its

6

legislative history, and the important policies

7

underlying federal bribery law unequivocally demonstrate

8

that the statute should not be given the restrictive

9

reading that has been urged

upon this Court by

petitioners.

that the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of

Appeals should be affirmed.
