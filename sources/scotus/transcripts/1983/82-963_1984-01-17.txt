Fourth

Amendment to the United States Constitution

requires application of the exclusionary rule to

11

evidence seized by police acting under the authority of

12

a search warrant issued upon a finding of probable cause

13

but which is later invalidated because of the technical

14

error cf omission committed by the issuing judge, an

15

errcr cf which the police had nc knowledge, took nc

16

advantage and which resulted in no prejudice to the

17

def end ant.
The Supreme Judicial Court of the Commcnwealth

18

of Massachusetts ruled that suppression was required

20

because this Court had not yet recognized an exception

21

to application of the exclusionary rule for an errcr of

this type.

QUESTION:

10

Miss Smith, what would have been,

if they had been successful, the real form?

MISS SMITH:

12

QUESTION:

13

Yes, Your Honor.

We vculd not be here.
I know.

What is the difference

between it and the one they used?
MISS SMITH:

14

The proper form has a space in

15

which ycu fill in the items listed in the affidavit or

16

make a simple notation, "See affidavit incorporated cr

17

attached herein" and then staple the affidavit to the

Marijuana is a

Sc the warrant really was

def ective?
MISS SMITH;

11

Yes, as far as the items

12

reflecting the specific items specified in the

13

affidavit.

14

QUESTION;

If you presented it to the owner of

15

the premises tc be searched and he said, "What are you

16

searching for?", you could net tell that from the

17

examination of the warrant itself.

18

MISS SMITH:

Officer O’Malley could tell that

19

because he was the one who applied for it and specified

20

the items to be searched.

21

QUESTION:

Eut the owner of the premises

22

presumably could not tell what items a search had been

23

authorized for.

24

MISS SMITH;

That is right.

They could only

tell that a search had been authorized for controlled

QUESTION';

4

Miss Smith, is it not correct that

5

when they executed the warrant they had the affidavit

6

with them?

7

MISS SMITH;

8

QUESTION;

9

10

Yes, they did.
So they cculd have shewed their the

affidavit which would then have given them a bill of
par tic ulars.

11

MISS SMITH;

12

QUESTION;

Absolutely, Your Honor.
If I understand it, all that the

13

judge had tc do was simply in that space that said

14

"controlled substances" was strike it cut and put in

15

"see attached affidavit”?
MISS SMITH;

16
17
18
19

20

That is right.

That is all he

had to do.
QUESTION;

It would have made a perfect

warrant then.
MISS SMITH;

That would have made a perfect

21

warrant, but as the court found through total

22

inadvertence the judge failed tc do that in the rush.

23

QUESTION;

He was a real judge.

MISS SMITH;

it.

MISS SMITH;

Yes.

He might have, tut I dc not

think there is any obligation -QUESTION;

Well, there is no doubt that he

21

would have, is there?

22

MISS SMITH;

I would hope that he would have.

23

I mean, I think once this was brought to his attention

24

he would see the mistake that was made and correct it.

25

QUESTION;

Of course, if you are a policeman

the chance that you may feel who am I to tell the judge

2

what form of warrant tc use —
KISS SMITH*

3

Absolutely.

The police Knew what

4

they had asked for.

They were assured that they get

5

what they asked for, and they left with both the

6

affidavit and the warrant.
I think that the police have no obligatior tc

7

8

do anything further than secure the warrant.

9

the constitutional obligation stops there.

I think
In the

10

general case there is simply nothing mere they could

11

do.
QUESTION *

12

You think the police have no

13

obligation whatever to comply with what is written on

14

the fact of the warrant?
MISS SMITH*

15

I am not saying that. Your

16

Honor.

I am saying in this case they did net read the

17

warrant.

18

They were moving quickly before this evidence was

19

destroyed.

They knew exactly what they needed to get.

They did net read the warrant.
QUESTION:

20

Well, if, as you told us, the law

21

of Massachusetts is that the warrant is presumptively

22

valid once signed then it is valid on the instant it was

23

served .

24
25

MISS SMITH:

That is right.

I think since the

warrant is presumptively valid there really is no

15

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

obligation on the police to, in a sense, secondguess or

2

judge the judqe.
QUESTION;

3

Yes, but, Miss Smith, it is

4

presumptively valid to seize what the warrant says may

5

be seized, is it net?

6

MISS SMITH;

7

QUESTION;

8

Yes, Your Honor, and the —
Is it presumptively valid to seize

something that is net listed in the warrant?
MISS SMITH;

9

Not once that is determined after

10

the fact, but the pelice dc not wait until another ccurt

has reviewed the warrant.

They did not ask to see it.

2

QUESTIONi

What weight does that have?

3

KISS SMITH:

I dc not think it really has any

weight.

I think what we have here is a case in which

reasonable good faith reliance upon a judicially issued

Well, could they be admitted

because of the weapon or because of the warrant?

you knew which one?
MISS SMITH:

There is absolutely nothing in

the record to support even speculation that they were

admitted, because they were waiving weapons at the

2

warrant had said see attached affidavit?
HE. REINSTETN;

3

The key, I think, is the

4

sufficiency of the words of incorporation whether cr the

5

face of the warrant there is an indication by the

6

magistrate that he cr she intended to adopt the language

7

of another document so that if there is sufficient words

8

of description in the warrant itself sufficient to

9

identify either by saying "see attached" and the

10

document is attached or "see a document" and describes

11

the document by date and author, then I believe that

that would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the

The second point cn the question cf prejudice

2

is that although Detective C’Malley knew what he wanted

to search for the warrant did not give specific

direction to the police officers who were responsitle

5

for executing the search.

On page 28a it says with respect to the manner

in which the warrant was served, "The defendant's mother

informed them of the fact he had a warrant authorizing

8

the search of the second fleer premises and area

MR. REINSTEINs

That is correct.

19

The record before the Court includes the full

20

testimony that was considered by the trial judge, and T

21

suggest that the Court is net bound to accept a finding

22

which is not based on any evidence at all where the sole

evidence is something else, that the judge's finding is

24

clearly erroneous and is not necessarily to be accepted

25

by this Court.

40

There is a third reason why there is if net

4

that is that as in this case we are trying to determine

That raises the possibility if that is an

14

that the police officers and the prosecution can attempt

15

to bring in additional evidence tc gc behind the warrant

to show that the warrant did net mean what it said and
