CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES HIEKEN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. HIEKEN;
please

Hr. Hieken, I think you

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the Court;
This case presents the question whether when

constitutional rights are involved appellate judges who

10

did not hear the witnesses testify can conduct a de novo

11

review of the cold printed record of a lengthy bench

12

trial unrestrained by the clearly erroneous requirements

13

of Rule 52(a) or the due process requirements of the

14

Fifth Amendment and reverse the findings of the D.S.

15

District Court judge who heard the witnesses testify.
In 1967 Dr. Amar G. Bose,

18

a professor of

17

electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of

18

Technology, invented the 901 loudspeaker system.

19

design of the 901 loudspeaker system was based on 12

20

years of research at MIT.

The

21

In 1968 Rose began marketing the loudspeaker

22

and the 901 loudspeaker met with success in the market

23

place.

24

had received the best reviews which had been given to a

25

lcudsoeaker product.

The District Court had found that the Bose 901

3

1

Then in 1970 Respondent Consumers Union

2

published an article entitled "Loudspeakers'* in its

3

monthly magazine "Consumer Reports" purporting to rate

4

24 medium priced loudspeakers based on tests and

5

measurements conducted in its laboratories by its

8 engineers including the use of panelists.

The article

7

also reported on tests conducted of some higher priced

8

loudspeakers under the heading "Some Loudspeakers of

9

Special Interest".
One of these loudspeakers of special interest

10
11

was the Bose 901 loudspeaker system.

The District Court

12

found that the article as a whole disparaged the 901

13

loudspeaker system.

14

In particular the District Court found that

15

one statement was actionable in that it was false and

16 disparaging.

Based on observations of panelists playing

17

recordings through the Bose 901 loudspeaker system, the

18

article reported "worse individual instruments heard

19

through the Rose system tended to wonder about the

20

room".

21

The District Court judge then determined that

22

Bose was a public figure and would be reguired to meet

23

the actual malice test of Sew York Times and, therefore,

24

had to prove that CU knew of the falsity of the

25

statement by clear and convincing evidence.

What the

1

District Court judge did was to focus on the knowledge

2

of the author of the statement, A. L. Seligson who was

3

the engineer in charge of conducting the tests and who

4

actually wrote the article.
He was one of the two panelists who

5
6

participated in th

test upon which the false statement

7

was based.

3

complained promptly.

Well, Lhen the article came out Bose

HR. HIEKENs

25

QUESTION:

Yes,

Your Honor.

As to the disparaging nature of the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIR8T ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

language which you just referred to both the District

2

Court and the Court of Appeals ruled in your client's

3

favor on that point.

4
5

HR. HIEkEN ;

That is correct. Your Honor,

yes .

8

They had set these louipseakers at the end of

7

the room about 10 feet apart and supposedly they played

8

recordings through them.

8

you probably know what stereo sound is that you have a

10

speaker at the left and a speaker at the right just as

11

in this courtroom to the left of the bench there is a

12

column of three speakers and similarly to the right.

13
14

QUESTIONj

At the trial — By the way,

You don't sound like you are on

stereo.

15

(Laughter)

16

MR. HIEfCENs

That is probably because we are

17

sending the signals and faced both channels

18

simultaneously so you get mono, right.
But in stereo -- You are exactly riaht

19

though

20

because now you ace observing what happens when both

21

left and right loudspeakers receive sound energy of the

22

same intensity.

23

mid dl a .

The sound appears to come fromm the

Now if you were to turn down the loudspeaker
24
at your left you would hear the sound coming from the

right,

and if you turned down the intensity of the sound

2

at the right you would hear the sound coming from the

3

left.
That is just what happens in a stereo system.

4
5

Gradually

they raised the level of the left and then

in

0

the right and the net impact on you is that you hear

7

instruments that come from various points between the

8

two loudspeakers and that is normal stereo sound.

9

can try it at home on your own stereo system by taking

You

10

your balance control and moving it to the left and then

11

to the

right.

You will get the same effect.

That is basically what Seligscn and Lefkow

12
13

testified

theyheard at the special listening test.

14

they said that they observed movement on only one

15

instrument.

16

and they said that the movement was restricted tc

That one instrument was the violin sounds,

17 movement between

18

Row

the left and the right loudspeaker.

It did not wander about the room.

Row during

19

cress examination Seligson and Lefkow each drew on large

20

charts exactly what they heard during the special

21

listening test and reproductions of those drawings are

22

included in Petitioner’s brief after page 12.

23

One of them is Plaintiff’s Exhibit 29.

That

24

was the drawing that Seligson made.

The loudspeakers

25

are represented as small pentagons at one end of the

8
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

wall, and they look much like home plate in a baseball

2

tjaue.

3

Seligson drew a red line between the

4

loudspeakers with arrowheads at each end and the various

5

violin sounds came from various points on that line

6

between the loudspeakers and from nowhere else.

7

drew something somewhat similar on Plaintiff's Exhibit

8

35 which is a small red rectangle between the left and

9

right loudspeakers, and the sounds came from that region

10
11

Lefkow

and nowhere else and only on the violin.
The piano sounds did not wander they testify.

12

Well, on cross examination after that drawing was

13

completed Seligson was asked why did you use the words

14

"tended to wander about the room" to describe what you

15

had drawn on the board?

16

Seligson replied, "Well, "about" meant to me

17

mean about the rear wall between the speakers."

18

happened, the District Court made specific findings.

19

They said, "Look.

20

movement alona the wall betwen the two speakers.

21

is normal stereo sound basically.”

22

What

People would not be surprised tc find
That

Movement throughout the other areas of the

23

room was not to be expected.

Such a bizarre effect is

24

contrary to what listeners are accustomed tc and

25

be objectionable to most listeners.

The District Ccur t, of course, heard Seligson

2

testify on six trial days a nd he found that Seligson’s

testimony on "about the coo m" meaning along the wall

between speakers not credib le based on his demeanor and

found that the testimony of CU's technical director who

at the time of the tests wa s associate technical

8

director was wholly untrust worthy and not credible»

In a ddition,

the District Court

9

At the conclusion of the damage trial there

10

was an appeal and the Court of Appeals as Mr. Justice

11

Rehnguist noticed found the statement disparaging and

12

assumed it was false, tut t hen the Court of

Appeals went

13 on and said now what we must do is we must perform a de
14

novo review of the record n ot limited by the clearly

15

erroneous requirements of R ule 52(a).

16

Now in the course of this review the Court of

17

Appeals did not mention und er the heading "review" the

18

state of mind of the author Seligson but instead it

19

focused on the editorial re view and in connection with

20

this editorial review it re lied on the testimony of

21

Monte Florman, the associat e technical director whose

22

testimony was found by the District Court to be wholly

23

untrustworthy and not credi ble .

24
25

In making referen ce to wall maybe he was only
guilty of using imprecise 1 anguage it appeared to be

relying on the testimony of Seligson to the effect,

2

well, what did you want me to say instead of wandered

3

about the room?

4

across the wall?

Would you be happier if I had said
I think not.

What the Court of Appeals also did is it said

5
6

it is not enough for Bose to prove actual malice

7

according to the New York Times test, but Bose had to

8

prove evidence of actual malice by showing evidence of

9

negligence,

motive and intent.

The Court of Appeals

10

said, well, we are just unable to find clear and

11

convincing proof that Consumers Union knew that the

12

false and disparaging statement that it published was

13

false.
Well, there are a number of errors in the way

14
15

the Court of Appeals conducted is review.

16

it made a de novo review of the record to determine if

17

the evidence was clear and convincing to it, not whether

18

it could have been clear and convincing to the United

19

States District Court judge who tried the case, who

20

actually heard

21

observe their demeanor, who when he was troubled on a

22

point was able to question the witness and clarify that

23

point.

Nay I ask you — What do you think

the Court of Appeals' job was?

HR. HIEKENt

1

We have set that oat in our reply

2

brief

I think beginning on page 4.

3

that the thing to do for a Court of Appeals is (1) look

4

at the findings of fact that the District Court judge

5

found.

6

Basically --

Do those findings of fact support the judgment?

QUESTION:

7

Basically we suggest

Well, are you suggesting that the

8

New York Times standard does net require any different

9

review of factual findings than in any other kind of

10

case?

--

As I understand the Court of

13

Appeals they said this is a First Amendment case under

New York Times against Sullivan.

15

to look at the record more closely than we normally

16

would .

We have a special duty

17

Do you disagree with that?

18

YP. HIEKEN;

No.

In New York Times it said

19

that the type of review conducted is an independent

20

examination of the whole record, and it is the whole

21

record.

22
23

That means —

So that to the extent that the

court did independently examine the whole record

QUESTION*

That part was fight.

3

SR. HIEKEN';

Conducting a de novo review in

4

effect disregarding the findings of fact is not correct,

5

and that is not what the Court of Appeals did.

6

not examine the evidence to see if the evidence if

7

believed by the District Court could support the

8

findings of fact.

9

It did

That was to be the second point of

After you find the findings of fact that he

10
11

found support the judgment you want to examine the

12

evidence to see if the evidence if believed by the

District Court judge would support those findings and

14

the District Court judge has in a Hew fork Times case

7

HR. KIEKENs

8

I think

No, I know it is not.
I know, but I think you are

correct on that point.
So —

9

QUESTIONS

10

I take it you are not asking us to

11

cut back on the New York Times?

12

HR. KIEKENs

That is correct.

It is not

13

necessary.

At the District Court level we said that it

14

was not necessary for the District Court even to

15

determine whether Bose was a public figure because we

10

could prove by clear and convincing evidence that there

17

was actual malice.
I was going on to the third point which was

18
19

that the Court of Appeals must not make is novo findngs

20

of fact based on the cold printed record, and the fourth

21

point which really has already been brought out here is

22

it must not rely on testimony which the District Court

23

judge found to be not credible.
QUESTION;

24
25

not sure.

That is what —

Hay I just ask. because

2

to take a good hard look at the record here and be sure

3

that the Court of Appeals did its job correctly?
MR. HIEKEN;

4

I think that we are asking you to

5

take a look and see whether the Court of Appeals did its

6

job —

So there really is not any question

of law of any particular significance at stake.
MR. HIEKEN ;

Well, I think there is.

I think

10
11

QUESTION;

12

what I am trying to find out.

13

MR. HIEKEfes

If there is, what is it?

That is

What it is is that the Court of

14

Appeals said it was not bound by the clearly erroneous

15

rule of Rule 52(a), and we submit that that is

16

inconsistent with the trilogy of cases that this Court

17

deciced in 19P2 beginning with Pullman-Standard

18

and followed by Inwood Laboratories or Ives Laboratories

v. Swint

19
20
21
22

23
24
25

QUESTION;

The other side of that is you say

that, therfore, the Court of Appeals could not have,
should not have purported to make de novo findings.
MR. HIEKEN*
QUESTION;

Absolutely.

That is correct.

What do we do with the testimony of

the witness that the judge said was incredible?

1

judge's ruliau on that point being clearly erroneous

2

under that circumstance, but anyway —
If I may I would like to focus on another

3
4

important area where the Court of Appeals missed the

5

boat,

6

this Court’s decision in the Cantrell v. Forest City

7

Publishing Company case because in that case it said

8

that knowledge of the author of falsity is attributable

9

to the publisher when the author is performing this

10

and that is that it missed — It did not consider

writing in the course of his employment.
The Court of Appeals did not cite it and

11

10

Then the author minimized his judgments

when listening to soloists.”
The District Court found defamation,

disparagement only by breaking the sentence in two, by

13

parsing it artificially.

14

which referred to "instruments seeming to crow to

language in the article that the effects were

I think if there is any

difference that this Court is even freer in such a

10

case.

Rule 52 as noted is a rule of federal civil

11

procedure, and it is not of the same magnitude and order

12

as the Constitution.
I think it would be an anomolous situation if

this Court had greater authority to review facts found

In this case I believe not

because this is not a defamation case, a libel suit

brought by an individual plaintiff where there may be

although I state this only arguendo a more balanced

17

weighing of the rights involved, the reputation of an

18

individual person against the rights of freedom of

20

In this case this is a product disparagement

case where the only interest of the plaintiff involved

is the interest of the reputation of its product, an

Every attack on good faith was rejected by the

These included testimony by the plaintiff and

cross examination of the defendant which took, up a

lengthy substantial portion of the trial contending that

9

the author was biased against the Bose because of a

10

competing patent which the author held.

The District

11

Court specifically on the basis of *r. Seligson's

12

demeanor ruled out any bad faith on that ground.

13

The District Court likewise ruled out again on

14

the basis of Seligson’s testimony the charge made by the

15

Petitioner that he had fabricated other tests.

16

Petitioner also charged that Consumers Union was biased

towards low priced products.

everything in the record is quite plain that there was

It did so and it

As ths Court has stated in Pullman-Standard v.

7

Swint if the District Court's findings rest on erroneous

8

view of law they may be set aside on that basis and are

9

not sjbject to the restrictions of Rule 52.

The record

10

is again clear.

The District Court opinion is plain

11

that the only reason for fining actual malice, the only

12

reason articulated by the District judge was that the

13

author was too intelligent to have made an honest

14

mistake»

15

There was nothing else in the record, nothing

16

else relied upon by the District Court for its finding.

17

It was that and that alone.

18

the District Court committed plain legal error.

19

We believe that in doing so

It inferred malice from falsity and applied an

20

objective reasonable person standard which has been

21

forbidden by this Court specifically in Garrison v.

22

Louisiana where the lower court, the state court, there

23

had found actual malice because it said it is

24

inconceivable to me that the defendant could have had a

25

reasonable belief which could be defined as an honest

2

guilty of what he charged them with.
This Court rejected that analysis stating that

3
4

this is not a holding applying the New York Tiroes test.

5

The reasonable belief standard applied by a trial judge

6

is not the same as the wreckless disregard of truth

7

standard.

8

The District Court's holding if allowed to

9

stand would in fact turn New York Times on its head.

It

10

would effectively impose strict liability upon

11

responsible conscientious publishers such as Consumers

12

Union with hardworking, caring, intelligent writers and

13

editors.
It would render their carefully constructed

14
15

editorial procedures designed to achieve accuracy

16

irrelevant and meaningless.

17

very procedures by virtue of the high standards of

18

journalism which they embody they would be ruled

19

incapable of making an honest mistake and given

breathing space for honest error.

Indeed, by virtue of these

If, Your Honor, please.

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;
I would like to answer your question, Mr.

12
13

Justice Blackmun, about the Baumgartner case which

14

basically deals with an ultimate finding of fact there

15

which is really a conclusion of law or a mixed question

16

of law and fact and, of course, the Court can always

17

look at the evidence to see if there is enough evidence

18

to be clear and convincing to the trier of fact.
That is a question of law.

19

Whether the trial

20

court found it to be clear and convincing is a question

21

of fact.

22

In the Woodby case at 385 U.S. 276 on page 367

23

this Court pointed out there is an elementary but

24

crucial difference between burden of proof and scope of

25

review and that is, of course, commonplace in the law.

It said the difference is most graphically illustrated

2

in a criminal case.
There the prosecution must prove guilt beyond

3
4

a reasonable doubt, but if the correct burden of proof

5

was imposed at the trial judicial review is generally

6

limited to ascertaining whether the evidence relied upon

substantiality to support the rationality of the

judgment.
