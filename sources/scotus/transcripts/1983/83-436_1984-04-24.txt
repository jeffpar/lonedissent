CEAL ARGUMENT OF FAUI M. BATCR, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF CF PETITIONERS

7

ME. BATOR;

9

We will hear argurrerts

may it

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

please the Court;
This case raises questions about the

10
11

President's authority in connection with national

12

emergency economic embargoes, that is, in connection

13

with programs of comprehensive control on financial and

14

property transactions that apply to a few countries with

15

which cur foreign relations are in a state of very

16

special and acute difficulty.
This case involves Cuba.

17

The embargo that is

18

involved here is very much like the Iranian assets

19

control program that was before the Court in Dames 6

20

Moore,

21

in Dames £ Moore, the Trading With the Enemy Act of. 1917

22

and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act,

23
24
25

and the case involves the very statute considered

which is known as "IEf^A."
Specifically, this case presents the question
of the validity of regulations issued in 1982 by the

1

Treasury which prohibit certain financial transactions

2

incident tc travel to Cuba.

3

regulations provide that Americans traveling to Cuba may

4

spend money for Cuban goods and services only if the

5

travel involves Government business or involves

6

journalism or involves scholarly research or a visit to

7

close relatives, or if it is authorized by a specific

8

license in connection with humanitarian activities or in

9

connection with sporting or artistic exhibitions.

In effect, these

The regulations do not prohibit travel as

10
11

such.

You are free to go tc Cuba if, for instance, you

12

have friends or relatives who invite you or will fund

13

you, or if the Cuban Government or a Cuban organization

14

will fund your visit, sc that hard currency is net spent

15

in Cuba.

16

unless you fall within one of the licensed categories.

17

The 1982 regulations here modified a general

19

21

they went to Cuba.

22

of 1977 -- that's an important date -- which gave

Now,

that general license itself was, however,

23

subject to important qualifications on the flew of

24

American travel dollars tc Cuba.

25

credit card companies were not allowed to make credit

4

For instance, American

1

card arrangements in Cuba, and that made it harder fcr

2

Americans tc travel on credit.

3

Perhaps more significant, travelers who wanted

4

to co tc Cuba under that general license pretty much had

5

to arrange for charter travel, because financial

6

transactions in connection with any scheduled voyages to

7

Cuba were not permitted by that license.
Both the

8
9

'77 license and the

'82 modifications

were part of the overall Cuban assets ccntrcl

10

regulations, regulations that continuously since

11

have subjected all economic transactions between

12

Americans and Cuba or Cubans tc a comprehensive system

13

of licensure.
Section

14

1963

201(b) of the Cuban assets control

15

regulations has since *63 provided that no economic

16

transaction in which Cuba has any interest may go

17

forward without a license from the Treasury, sc that by

18

the terms of regulation 201(b) it has been unlawful

19

1S63 to spend American dollars in connection with

New, from '63 to

21

'77 these licenses were

22

issued on an individual basis to particular

23

individuals.

24

which

25

Then in

'11 came the general license,

was in turn modified in 1982.
The legal issue before the Court is whether

5

1

there is a valid legal authority for the 1982

2

modifications.

3

were themselves issued under Section 5(b)

4

Trading With the Enemy Act, which broadly authorizes the

5

President during war or during peacetime declared

6

national emergencies to use rules or regulations or

7

licenses to regulate or prohibit any transaction

8

involving any property in which Cuba -- in which a

9

foreign country or a foreign national has any interest.

10

Now, as explained in our briefs, the question

The Cuban assets control regulations
of the TWEA,

11

in the case arises because the TWEA was amended by

12

Congress in December of 1977 to apply generally only

13

during wartime.

14

connection with future national emergencies were

15

switched by Congress onto a different statutory track

16

under a new statute, IEEPA.

Peacetime economic embargoes in

IEEPA gave the President pretty much the same

situation -- there would be no continuity new, since

2

there was a general takeover.

3

issue really is moot.

4

the grandfather clause authorizes the reimpesition of

5

embargoes which have been completely eliminated.

6

So that as of how that

That is, we do not contend that

As Justice O’Connor question indicates, the

7

problem of this case arises because, although Congress

8

switched new national emergency embargoes onto the IEEPA

9

track, future ones, at the same time it did grandfather

10
11

the existing embargoes.
Congress decided that it did not want to force

12

the President to issue new national emergency

13

declarations under IEEFA in order to continue the four

14

existing embargo systems in operation in 1977, and

15

therefore it specified in the grandfather clause that

16

TWEA authorities which were being exercised on July 1,

17

1977, could continue to be exercised as long as the

18

President makes an annual determination that that is in

19

the national interest.

20

have each year made that determination.

21

And Presidents Carter and Peagan

Now, the Court of Appeals in this case held

22

that the President was without authority in 1982 to

23

modify the 1977 general license which governed the flow

24

of hard currency to Cuba, because it reasoned that the

25

'11 general license permitted many trave-re la ted

8

1

financial transactions; it was issued a few months

2

before the July 1,

3

concluded that the authority to regulate these

4

transactions was simply not being exercised at all on

5

that date.

'77, cutoff, and therefore it

The Government believes that the most

6

>

7

substantial question before the Court is the question of

8

the proper scope of the grandfather clause, and that

9

President Carter's 1977 general license is perhaps a

10

good starting point for the analysis of that issue.

11

I said, the Court of Appeals concluded that, since the

12

March

13

expenditures, it follows that the authority to regulate

14

them was net being exercised.

15

As

'77 general license authorized most travel-re 1 ated

But we think that’s a complete non sequitur

16

and that it is based on a misunderstanding of the

17

structure of the Cuban assets control program.

18

the authority to regulate financial transactions

19

incident to travel was being exercised on that date at

20

four different levels.

21

Ke think

First, we have regulation 201(b), which

22

prohibited all property transactions unless licensed.

23

This represented an underlying exercise of authority to

24

demand licensure, and that has been continuously

25

asserted since 1963.

9

1

Second, the general license gave permission to

2

engage in transactions incident tc travel, but agair.st

3

the background of regulation 201(b).

4

an act of regulation, net of deregulation.

5

We think this was

That is, the Court of Appeals simply assumed

6

that the exercise of an authority to regulate only gees

7

on at such times when the activity is prohibited.

8

we think that's a false picture.

9

of a system of licensure.

Eut

It distorts the nature

10

Regulatory authority does not simply vanish

11

when it is exercised tc license an activity, and this

12

point is made very plain by the words of the statute.

13

The grandfather clause doesn't authorize the

14

preservation simply of prohibitions on the bocks.

15

authorizes the reservation of authority of authorities

16

being exercised under 5(b), and 5(b) specifies that its

17

authorities include the power to regulate,

18

means of "licenses."

It

"regulate" by

19

Sc to us the message is quite clear.

20

was referring to the continuation of a licensing system,

21

an ongoing licensing system, which of course --

22

QUESTICNi

Congress

Do you think the message was as

23

clear in the minds cf Congress as it is tc you from

24

looking at the structure of the legislation?

25

there are expressions in the legislative history that

10

Certainly

1

would indicate that members cf Congress may have had a

2

different view and that they were really concerned about

3

thinking that the authorities then being exercised were

4

being grandfathered in, but nothing else.

5

MR. BATOR:

Well, Justice O'Connor, I think

7

that there are countervailing intonations and quite
?
often rather loose language in the legislative history.

8

Congress was torn by the fact that it wanted to

9

accomplish two ends:

6

one,

to narrow the President's

10

authority to use these peacetime embargoes; on the ether

11

hand, very clearly to allow the President to continue to

12

operate these existing embargoes.

13

That really was the compromise.

14

QUESTION:

Well,

I haven't spotted anything in

15

the legislative history that clearly indicates that the

16

members cf Congress were as aware of the structure that

17

you propose.

18

MR. EATOR:

Well, Your Honor, in cur brief we

19

do indicate that there are passages, although they are

20

not as — we would be happier if they were clearer, tut

21

we think there are in fact specific examples in the

22

legislative history where it was indicated that what

23

would be grandfathered was an embargo system, not simply

24

a kind cf frozen list cf specific prohibitions, because

25

there was no reference, certainly no reference to

11

1

anything involving the fact that travel was not to be

2

regulated.

3

the history cf the grandfather clause.

There is nc specific indication cf that in

Congress must have been aware that assets

4
5

controls programs generally have been ongoing and rather

6

flexible systems, subject to adjustment from time to

7

time.

8

in fact was being regulated at that time because the '77

9

license, general license, did include seme specific

10

There is another point here, which is that travel

regulations and prohibitions on financial transactions.
Now, that fact, cf course, must be a major

11
12

embarrassment to the Respondents' theory of this case.

13

It's ignored in their brief, ignored by the Court of

14

Appeals.

15

It raises a very important question.
On July 1,

'77, President Carter was in fact

16

prohibiting certain financial transactions incident to

17

personal travel, including all transactions incident to

18

scheduled travel.

19

said that the authority to regulate travel-related

20

financial expenditures was not being exercised?

Now, how, in light of that, can it be

21

I remind the Court, too, that the

22

license, which is sc critical to the Court cf Appeals'

23

theory of this case, was explicitly by regulation

24

subject to revocation and modification, and in that

25

respect we think this case is governed and controlled by

12

'77 general

1

Dames

£ Hoore, because in Dames £ Koore the Court

2

explicitly held that a general license subject to

3

revocation is a contingent instrument, subordinate to

4

the President's continuing underlying regulatory

5

authority, and that reasoning seems to us compelling

6

here.
I want to go back to Justice C'Connor's

7
8

question, which I think is really the heart of the

9

case.

10
11

What could Congress have had in mind when they

grandfathered this?
We think that it is simply an incoherent

12

account of what Congress could have meant to suppose

13

that they were simply freezing an existing laundry list

14

of specific prohibitions.

15

sensible or a credible reading.

16

could have wished to freeze the North Korean and the

17

Vietnamese and the Cuban embargoes so that the President

18

couldn't fill in loopholes or gaps, that he couldn't

19

clarify coverage, that he couldn't add a restriction,

20

for instance, in connection with a negotiation to create

21

an incentive for settlement.

22

We don't think this is a
I don't think Congress

The ironic thing actually is that under the

23

Court of Appeals'

reading the executive may even be

24

disabled from amending an embargo to implement a

25

negotiated settlement with another country, because that

13

J

1

settlement might call for the addition of new 5(b)

2

measures, as indeed happened in the Iranian settlement.
Again perhaps for example to look at the

3
4

general license, it's an interesting example, because

5

when it was first issued in March of *77 it did not

6

include the restriction on financial transactions

7

incident to scheduled travel.

8

'11.

That was added in May of

New, suppose it had teen added in August

9
10

rather than in May.

Is it conceivable that the

11

President would have been disabled from making it?

12

was obviously an afterthought or, if you will, the

13

filling in of something that was just overlooked.

14

that kind of adjustment could net be made.

15

that it creates a coherent system.

That

Eut

don’t think

Now, the Court of Appeals’ answer to this was,

16
17

use IEEFA.

But to use IEPFA requires the President to

18

issue a new national emergency declaration, and a

19

declaration that Cuba cr Vietnam represents an unusual

20

or extraordinary threat to the United States.

21

Justice C'Ccnnor, if there’s anything clear from the

22

legislative history, it is that the Congress was

23

persuaded by the Administration in this compromise that

24

it would be undesirable and awkward to force the

25

President to declare such a new emergency and make such

14

And

1

a statement in order to maintain these four

2

extraordinary embargoes.
The purpose of Congress to allow the President

3
4

to maintain these four extraordinary embargoes without

5

declaring a new national emergency would simply be

6

frustrated if what we say is that the only thing that

7

can be preserved is a frozen list of restrictions, that

8

is, that a new declaration has to be made every time

9

the re

10

a gap filled or a new restriction

imposed in order to create a bargaining chip.
MR. BATOR;

11

Mr. Bator, may I ask one question

12

about the change in May of

13

I'm not quite clear as I look at the material at the

14

very end of your brief where you quote the version of

15

the asset control regulation at 10(a) on.

16

that's what was in effect from March

17

* 82 .

18
19

20

1977 of the general license.

Does that include the May

You say

*77 through May of

'11 amendment or

does it not ?
MR. BATOR;

Yes,

Your Honor, that in fact is a

22

MR. BATOR:

I would just want to say that I’m

not — I could go back, but I think that subsections

21

(4), (5), and (6), certainly (4) and (5), were added in

22

May rather than in March, Your Honor.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But they seem tc be authorizations

rather than restrictions.
MR. BATOR:

Well, they're put in an odd way,

16

1

but what they add up tc when you come down to it in the

2

end is the creation cf a rule which says that ycu cannot

3

expend any moneys in connection with scheduled trips.
QUESTION:

4

In other words, it's an

5

authorization of all kinds of travel except scheduled

6

trips?
NR. BATORi

7

Most of the material on 11(a) was

8

added

in May rather than in March.

I don't take that as

9

a fundamental argument, Your Hcnor.

It just gives a

10

clue to how these programs in fact are managed and that

11

there is a constant system cf adjustments and repairs.

12

I want to say a word — I have only a few

13

minutes left — about the Passport Act cf 1978.

14

a statute which the Respondents say forbids the use cf

15

TWEA authorities or IEEF.A authorities.

16

exist and even if TWEA authorities were grandfathered,

17

they say that the Passport Act of

18

restricted, prohibited the President from regulating

19

expenditures incident to personal travel.

20

expenditures to personal travel are simply now a special

21

category which may not be regulated under these

22

comprehensive embargoes.

23

That's

Even if they did

'78 revoked,

They say that

We think this reading would -- in fact, we

24

think it necessarily follows that what Congress on that

25

reading, what Congress was doing in

17

'78 was invalidating

1

the ’77 general license with its restrictions,

Ne think

2

that this reading means that President Carter violated

3

the Passport Act when in 1980 he used IEEPA to control

4

expenditures, to prohibit expenditures in connection

5

with travel to Iran.
And the point is significant to us because the

6
7

Carter Administration was instrumental in the Passport

8

Act of

9

assumed that the Passport Act did not override this

'78.

Nevertheless,

President Carter clearly

10

preexisting separate power to regulate travel

11

expenditures in the context of comprehensive assets

12

embarg oes.
And we think that’s the natural assumption.

13
14

The Passport Act says nothing about economic or

15

financial transactions.

16

except the regulation of passports.

17

legislative history indicates that Congress was

18

overriding an independent, long-standing regulatory

19

power to restrict the flow of financial and economic

20

benefits to countries which — and I want to remind the

21

Court,

22

relations are in a state of acute difficulty.

23

It says nothing about anything
Nothing in the

the few countries with which by hypothesis cur

The Respondents speak as if it were so me bow

24

inconceivable that Congress could say that passports

25

must be issued on the one hand and yet that the

18

1

President could continue to exercise an authority to

2

restrict the flow of American dollars from American

3

travelers abroad.
But there’s nothing inconceivable about it.

4
5

It’s an absolute commonplace of modern public policy in

6

many countries -- England and France -- that have

7

created fiscal res trictions on th e expenditure of travel

8

moneys, without in any way aim ing at travel as such or

9

trying to restrict the liberty of the citizens t o

10

And we do not credit the Respondents’

grandfathered authority, can be used to negate the

But I thought Justice O'Connor's question

11
12

really was directed to the heart of the case here.

13

Congress did not direct itself to the four countries

14

referred to by my good friend the Deputy Solicitor

15

General.

Congress was concerned about two things:
First, the broad power that the President had

16
17

exercised over the many years which led Congress tc pass

18

the statute under consideration, which is not merely the

19

grandfather clause, tut the bread statute which included

20

IEEFA,

21

the Economic Control Act.
Congress in doing that was aware of the fact

22

that the proliferated emergencies declared by the

23

President over the years, A, were either outmoded or not

24

justified and, as the administrative spokesman stated tc

25

the Congress, particularly the Assistant Treasury

Therefore, Congress passed this very bread

7

8

statute which was upheld in IEEPA , in which Congress set

9

forth a procedure bringing the President into the --

10

bringing the Congress into the consultative operations

11

of this statute, because it was concerned with what had

12

been dene in the past.
Now, what the Government is doing here is

13
14

acting as if all we have to do here is consider what I

15

will consider in a moment, the savings clause, and it

16

forgets the dominant purpose of the legislation, which

17

was to restrict the President, and that the savings

18

clause was, as most savings clauses are, a narrow

19

savings clause for the purpose of preserving something.
And that really is the question , Justice

10

the suggestion made by the Government tha t there is some

11

ambiguity in the legislative history.

12

Now, as a matter of fact, as Yo ur Honors will

13

see from our brief, a proposal was made t o give the

14

power tc the Government, to the executive , under the

15

savings clause, precisely the one which i s suggested by

16

my friend here -- an old friend, I may sa y -- the power

17

to add new regulations, new controls.

18

legislation would have added another para graph to the

19

existing statute, which is that the Fresi dent can

20

exercise not only the authorities being e xercised, but

21

any other authority conferred upon the Fr esident by that

22

section may be exercised to deal with the same set of

QUEST ION s

15

MR. BOUDIN;

Correct.

May I address that?

Please ..
The Government actually has five

16

different theories of what the exercise of authorities

17

means, but let me address myself, which we’ve talked

18

about in our brief, to the general license theory.

19

general license is merely a convenient device for

20

withdrawing controls previously in existence, and Your

21

Honors will see that when you look at the China

22

situation.

23

The

I were to take an alternative way to handle the
If in Section 2C1, which fcrbids financial

some h esitation in accepting that.

This of course brings to mind Justice
Rehnqu ist’s opinion in Dames against I'ocre.

26

Dames

e

Mo ere , exc use me , against Fegan

1

against Mccre -- Dames

2

was a case in which th ere w as a gen eral lie ense issued

3

and the Government’s c enten tion * up held by the Court --

4

and I may say by me su ppert ing the Governme nt in that

5

case — was that where the Pres iden t had at tached

and allowed them to be sub j ect to a ttachm en ts, the

8

President by virtue of a la ter prov isicn wa s able to --

9

Was able to recover th e ass e ts and use them the way he

10

But in Dames against Moore there was no

11
12

grandf ather clause.

13

meanin g of the grandfather clause, and the grandfather

14

clause

15

to ind icated, was intended to allow only those

16

prchib itions that were in effect.

17

We are dealing here with the

was intended, as the twc courts that I referred

Now, why do I say that it was intended to do

18

that, aside from the language, which is uniform, as Your

19

Honors will see.

20

Congre ssmen who were in charge of this and the

21

admini strative spokesmen recognized that they were

22

a ttemp ting to save something, to save the embargoes in

23

existe nee, and most important, to save the assets which

24

were u nder embargo, to save these from being given away,

25

becaus e it was recognized there would be dealings with

It is precisely because the

27

1

Cuba and with other countries eventually.
But more than that it is not, because the

2
3

continuation -- and this is the key problem with the

4

Government’s position -- the continuation under the

5

savings clause of those controls, those embargoes, was

6

net predicated upon an emergency, it was predicated upon

7

a non-emergency, and it is because of that that we have

8

to give a limited interpretation to those words in the

9

savings clause.
Now, when we consider the Government’s

10
11

argument of flexibility, an argument which this Court of

12

course upheld in Dames £ Noore, that was flexibility

13

under IEEPA, the Economic Control Act, subject to the

14

control which Congress had and exercised in that real

15

emergency of consultation with the President.
Flexibility is of course necessary in foreign

16
17

relations, and that’s why IEEPA was passed.

18.

is not necessary in connection with the savings clause,

19

because the savings clause is based upon a narrow area

20

which cannot be justified on an emergency basis.

21

Mr. Bergsten recognized and hr. Katz, from another

22

Department of the Government, in testifying recognized

23

that there might net be constitutional validity even to

24

those things being grandfathered, because there was no

25

emergency.

28

Flexibility

And

Sc that whether we take the conception of the

1
2

statute as a whole, it comes down to the question of

3

what was prohibited.

4

we said about general licenses, lest the conceptual

5

thing overlook the reality here, in the China situation,

6

which

7

in the China situation where there's a general license

8

permitting everything, we could restore that, if we

9

wanted

the Government says it's troubled about answering,

to, under the grandfather clause.

10

Now, I do want to address --

11

QUESTION;

authority alive?

rather than emergency.
QUESTION;

to China, so that could not be revived.
ME. BOUDIN;

I don't — yes, Your Honor is

20

quite right.

21

didn't do it with respect to China.

22
23

I don't think he did it.

QUESTION;

I assume he

Well, they say in the briefs he

didn't do it.

24

ME. BOUDIN;

I'll accept that.

25

Now, I want to remind the Court what the

29

1

Government has done here.

2

contrast to the rather clear-cut position taken ty the

3

Court cf Appeals for the First Circuit and the Eleventh

4

independently -- Your Honors will read the reasoning of

5

the Court cf Appeals' opinion, I trust, in the Eleventh

6

Circuit — the Government gives four or five different

7

possible interpretations of the grandfather clause,

8

itself making each one suspect, although not

9

conclusively so, of course.

10

QUESTIONi

11

MR. BOUDIN:

12

QUESTION:

The Government has, in

Mr. Boudin.
Yes.
Ycur brief struck me as somewhat

13

different in theory than the Court of Appeals' opinion.

14

Was I wrong in thinking that?

15

MR. BOUDIN:

I do know that the Government

16

made that point.

17

courts, Courts of Appeals, Eleventh and the First, are

18

of the opinion that if there is a substantive control

19

being exercised by regulation -- that may be the thing

20

that was confusing -- a substantive control being

21

exercised over travel or over anything, that control

22

could be continued by the grandfather clause.

23

differ with the Court of Appeals.

24
25

I think we and the courts below, both

We do not

Now, remember what the Government has said, if
Your Honors please:

We believe that one possible

30

1

reading of the grandfather clause is -- rather an odd

2

way to find a clear-cut statute involving a tasic

3

liberty like the right to travel.
The first argument is that if any 5(b)

4
5

authority is exercised, the Government preserves all

6

5(b) authorities.

The second argument is that under any

7

exercise of a 5(b)

authority, referring to the statute

8

now, with respect to property, then everything can be

9

exercised.

10

We pointed out in our answering brief that

11

there was a problem raised with the Government's two

12

views,

13

many countriesnot merely the four that the Government

14

now targets, although there was no indication they were

15

to be targeted, with respect to many countries there

16

were,

17

transa ctions.

and the main problem was that with respect tc

A, controls under 5(b) generally and controls ever

18

So the Government came back with its general

19

license theory which, as I have indicated, is really a

20

language problem, a semantic problem, rather than

21

dealing with the reality.

22

trust Ycur Honors will look at the House Committee

23

report on this bill. Report No. 95-459, which we cite in

24

our brief, but I regret to say somewhat elliptically,

25

because that House report, in discussing the Cuban

"Under the Cuban assets control regulations,

4

The important thing is, Congress had in mind — I can't

5

call it a bill of attainder, having heard yesterday's

6

argument.

7

Congress had in mind four countries.
Well, this is an odd situation.

So you have a

8

flexibility argument that they would recognize, that

9

they insist upon with respect to four countries, and you

10

have another standard, namely non-flexibility with

11

respect to all other countries of the world.

12

Your Honors will read or have read the

13

legislative history.

You'll find no theory under which

14

Congress drew a line between "comprehensive embargoes

15

and embargoes generally."

16

Now, as far as IEEPA is concerned, one of

17

course has to ask, not under my theory that perhaps

18

IEEPA couldn't control, but under the Court of Appeals'

19

implied view that IEEPA applies, why the Government

20

doesn’t deal, doesn’t go under IEEFA.

21

the Administration spokesmen and the Congressmen didn't

22

want, for the continuation of the old controls in old

23

situations to have to have an application under IEEPA.

24

But IEEPA wa passed for a purpose.

25

They didn't want,

15

that suddenly Congress — the President could disregard

the drafting of the IEEPA.

18

And they have not followed that procedure.

19

Congress didn’t intend that when new crises arose

Seven years of study went into
There was a reason fcr it.

This will bring me very briefly to three other

20

points that have been made in our brief and that

21

obviously the Court of Appeals did not decide any of

22

those points, although I think it considered seme cf

23

them in determining the general interpretation, the

24

narrow interpretation cf the savings clause.

25

The first relates to the 1978 statute.

35

The

1

1978 statute was passed because the Congress was net

2

satisfied, as a matter of fact the Administration wasn't

3

satisfied, to rest merely upon President Carter's

4

remeva1 cf bars to travel tc Cuba.

5

the committees in charge said, we don't want this tc

6

depend upon a particular Administration's policies or

7

discretion.

And the reports cf

Creat prescience, as we see.

8

And they were con cerned about liberty of

9

meveme nt, and they said so , an d the basic Helsinki

10

genera 1 declaratio ns, which are not statutory of c

11

relating to freedom of movement.
Now, the Government says it talks about the

12
13

Secretary of State and it talks about passports.

Why do

14

we think this has anything tc do with this case?

Well,

15

the reason we do is because the Congress was concerned

16

about protecting liberty of movement.

17

its attention to the Secretary cf State, it was because

18

that was the normal way in which travel restrictions

19

were imposed.

If it directed

And as we argued in laub, and as we argued in

20

21

Zemel,

as we argued in Kent, the whole history of travel

22

control had been a history in which the Secretary cf

23

State was doing his jot, controlling it, sometimes we

24

said wrongly, sometimes the Court said rightly; and

25

Treasury, if it did anything, was ancillary.

36

QUESTION;

1

Are you saying that none of the

2

restrictions ever issued under the TWEA from the time of

3

its passage had any effect cn the control of travel?
ME. BOUDIN:

4

Your Honor will note that the

5

restrictions were never restrictions by regulation

6

directed specifically to travel, and I have suggested,

7

yes, I have thought that TWEA was never passed to

8

control travel as such.
I do recognize that every time the Secretary

9
10

of State gave a license -- sorry, amended a passport --

11

by removing restrictions, the Treasury Department would

12

automatically -- and I say automatically -- give a

13

license to spend money.
But I have found nothing in the legislative

14
15

history of TWEA that suggests that that statute really

16

authorized the practice even of the Treasury in

17

connection with licensing.
QUESTION;

18

Well, it authorizes the restriction

19

and control of property in the hands described, and if

20

the regulation affects the property the fact it has an

21

incidental effect cn travel doesn’t make it illegal

22

under the statute.
ME. BOUDIN:

23

Of course.

I haven’t suggested

24

that.

I have suggested that historically travel was

25

never contemplated by the Congress, and that each time

37

1

legislation was proposed to control travel nobody ever

2

mentioned the Treasury Department/ nobody ever mentioned

3

TWE A.

4

Laub, in discussing travel controls, recognized that the

5

first travel control statute was a 1918 statute, net the

6

197C TWEA.

And this Court in discussing either in Haig or in

I must say to Your Honor, as I say, we've

7

It is a murky

I cannot -- it's probably the reason why the

10

Court of Appeals did not think it advisable to found its

11

decision upon that.
Let me address finally the constitutional

12
13

issue.

I don’t want to overlook it.

We raised it, that

14

the Court consider the fact that we are dealing with a

15

liberty to be significant in interpreting the

16

grandfather clause, and that is this.
I would agree -- I must agree, having read

17
18

Agee,

having locked at a few other cases of this Court

19

in the travel area and elsewhere — that there are

20

emergency circumstances under which travel could be

21

controlled, forbidden, but net this one.

22

a very serious nuclear confrontation problem which it

23

addressed, with the consequent dangers to American

24

citizens traveling to Cuba, when I argued Zemel against

25

Rusk,

The Court had

and the Court held there, not that the President

38

1

could prevent the travel, but it said that the President

2

could not be compelled through the Secretary of State to

3

validate a passport for travel to Cuba.
Then came Haig against Agee, the second

4
5

clear-cut bar on travel, but of an individual.

6

Court is aware of the stipulations made by Congress and

7

of the findings made in the Chief Justice's opinion with

8

respect to the great danger to foreign relations, to

9

national security, in the possible assassination of CIA

10

And the

agents .
Given these facts, I may say, I don't -- quite

11
12

aside from the question of statutory authorization, I

13

don't see hew the constitutional power of the Government

14

could be challenged to meet situations such as Haig and

15

Agee.

16

But what do we have here in reality?

We have

17

a hypothetical that if somebody goes to Cuba with his

18

dollars, including these Americans who have never

19

violated any laws at all and who are perfectly good

20

people, if somebody goes to Cuba with his dollars, that

21

money will someday help build a Cuban tourist industry.

22

I'm not an authority on how to build an industry,

23

including a tourist industry, tut I suspect it's a long

24

way off between the dollars of American citizens today

25

and building it.

39

And that industry will make money, and with

1
2

that money they will eventually be able to subvert Latin

3

America against American interests.

4

series of hypethetieals is far too tenuous, particularly

5

in the light of the amount of money which, as we

6

describe in our brief, we are allowing to go to Cuba by

7

the travel that is permitted.

Thank you, Your Honor.

I think that Mr. Eoudin and the Government are

Mr. Eoudin takes this whole bundle of complex

22

authorities, which include the general regulation

23

201(b), the restricted general license, the fact that

24

that restricted license is subject to revocation and

25

modification, and he just says that all adds up to

40

1

totqal

deregulation, and he says a general license in

2

general is nothing but an administrative technique for

3

deregulation .
But the very first exercise cf power to

4
5

regulate travel-related transactions under the TWEA in

6

1940 by President Roosevelt, in connection with

7

remittances abroad, to travelers abroad, was by way cf a

8

general license and asserted the authority to restrict

9

expenditures over £250 a month.
If this Court will read its own opinion in

13

administrative technique which receded and said, we are

QUESTION;

Nr. Bator, may I ask just one

question I'm a little puzzled about.

QUESTION;

MR. BATORi

We dc not think, we dc not think

13

it would be a fair reading of this legislation tc use

14

those as a springboard for a comprehensive assets

program.

We have never maintained that.
