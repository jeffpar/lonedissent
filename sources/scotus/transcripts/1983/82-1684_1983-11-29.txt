ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF CF APPELLANTS
MR. HOROWITZi

7

please the Courts
This case is here on direct appeal under 28

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

U.S.C.

1252 from the United States District Court for

10

the District of North Dakota.

11

District Court’s decision holding unconstitutional the

12

investigative provisions of the Fair Lator Standards

13

Act, specifically the Court's holding that the Fourth

14

Amendment prohibits the use of an administrative

15

subpoena for the inspection of documents and rather

16

requires that a search warrant be obtained before any

17

documents may be examined.

18

Under review is the

Because some of the briefs here have generated

19

some confusion about the issue presented I think it

20

would be useful to summarize briefly the background of

21

this litigation.

22

On January 6, 1982 A1 Codes, the Wage Hour

23

compliance officer, telephoned Appellee, a

24

restaurant-motel, located in Steele, North Dakota tc

25

schedule an inspection for the following day and to ask

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that certain wage and payroll records be made available

2

for inspection at that time.

3

When Appellee’s manager informed Godes that

4

the time was not convenient he rescheduled the

5

inspection for the following week.

6

Appellee’s counsel wrote to Mr. Godes stating that

7

Appellee would not consider the request for an

8

inspection until it was informed of either the nature of

9

the complaint that triggered the investigation or the

10

In the interim

scope cf the investigation.
The government responded with a letter

11

12

outlining the general scope of a fair labor standards

13

investigation and declining to give the reason for this

14

particular investigation.

15

rescheduled the inspection for two weeks hence.

In this letter the government

The letter also requested Appellee to inform

16
17

the government whether it would decline to permit the

18

inspection so that an administrative subpoena could be

19

obtained in that event.

20

permission would be refused under the authority of

21

Marshall v. Barlow’s and thereafter Appellee was served

22

with a

23

specified payroll records at the Department of Labor’s

24

Wage Hour Offices in Bismarck, North Dakota.

Appellee responded that

Labor that it would not comply with the subpoena on the

2

ground that it was invalid under Barlow’s, and to date

3

it has not produced the subpoena documents.

4

QUESTION!

Mr. Horowitz, do the Appellees

5

suggest that maybe this was really an attempt by the

6

government to get unauthorized entry into the premises?

7

Would you comment on that?

8

9

MR. HOROWITZ;

I just do not think, there is

any support for that in the record.

All we know is that

10

they phoned and — The government phoned and said that

11

it wanted to conduct an inspection the next day.

12

Appellee obviously did not feel compelled to

13

comply with this.

14

convenient and then later declined to permit the

15

government to enter.

16

QUESTION;

It simply first stated that it wasn’t

In the brief —
The question is not really before

17

us here, of course, but do you think the statutory

18

authority under the Act to enter and inspect the

19

premises is possibly invalid under Barlow’s?

20

MS. HOROWITZ;

Well, it has never come up

21

because the general practice of the Labor Department is

22

not to conduct these entries without consent so they did

23

not try to do it here.

24

If they did —

25

QUESTION;

They have never tried to do it.

Dc you think it is possibly

5

440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

invali d?
MR. HOROWITZ;

2

If they did I think unlike this

3

case Barlow's would be quite relevant and there would be

4

a sericus question under Barlow’s, but the question

5

would be whether Barlow's was distinguishable or not.

6

It might be difficult to distinguish.
Barlow's itself was careful tc confine itself

7

8

to the OSHA context so arguably it might be

9

distinguishable, but it would certainly be a close

10
11

case.
QUESTION;

Well, did the subpoena here

12

actually request entry?

13

MR. HOROWITZ;

No.

The subpoena specifically

14

said that it was returnable off the premises, that the

15

documents were to be produced at the Labor Department's

16

office in Bismarck, North Dakota.

17

I should say also in response to Justice

18

O'Ccnnor’s original question the Appellee has said and

19

the briefs in this Court have characterized the

20

Department of Labor's initial phone call as sort of a

21

demand for entry and tried to paint the picture that we

22

were trying to force our way in.

23

that's ccme up in the course of litigation.

That’s something

24

I think if you look at the more

25

contemporaneous discussion of what was going on the

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

letter that I just referred to that Appellee sent to the

2

government that is reproduced at page 13 of the Joint

3

Appendix Mr. Peterson stated "I represent Lone Steer

5

inspection we would like the following information."

Before we consider ycur request to conduct an

So I think at least at the time everyone

6

7

understood that this was just a request to enter the

8

premises.

9

characterized more as a demand.
QUESTION:

MR. HOROWITZ:

It was only later that this has been

Yes, the subpoena was

QUESTIONj

contempt for failing --

We filed as I was about to say

17

we filed a petition with the District Court to compel

Appellees to comply with this subpoena.

MR. HOROWITZ:

2

QUESTIONi

All he denies — Really all he says

you have no right to enter the premises.

3

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, that is what the order

4

says.

5

that the Appellee’s contention is that they are not

6

required to turn over these documents in response tc

7

this subpoena so the court seems to have understood that

8

what this case was about was a subpoena, but then when

9

it gets to drafting the order it just says that

10

In the course of the court’s opinion he states

government can’t enter on the premises.

11

At that point the government filed a motion to

12

amend the judgment pointing out to the court that all we

13

wanted

14

offices.

15

well either so perhaps the District Court did not

16

exactly focus on what was going on here, but I think it

17

is made clear enough in all the papers that have been

18

filed.

19

was for the documents tc be turned over at cur
The court did not really address that very

When Appellee declined to permit the

20

inspection originally the government responded with a

21

letter that outlined the general scope of the

22

investigation of a fair labor standards general

23

investigation but declined to give the reason for this

24

particular investigation, and as I said we reguested

25

that Appellee inform the government whether it would

1

consent — decline tc permit the inspection so the

2

subpoena could be obtained.
When Appellee declined to permit the

3
4

inspection a Department of Labor officer went to the

5

premises on February the 2nd and served him with the

6

subpoena.

7

declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that

8

the Fair Labor Standards Act was unconstitutional and

9

quoting from the complaint "insofar as it purports to

The Appellee brought this law suit seeking

10

authorize a warrantless inspection of records by way of

11

administrative subpoena after entry to inspect has been

12

denied•”

13

This action was consolidated with the

14

government’s action as discussed earlier petitioning the

15

District Court to compel Appellee to comply with the

16

subpoena, and the District Court found for the Appellee

17

without really explaining why.

18

relied exclusively cn Marshall v. Barlow’s and accepted

19

the Appellee’s contention that the subpoena was invalid

20

under Barlow's.

21

QUESTION{

The court’s opinion

I did not find that the court

22

referred to Oklahoma Press at all.

23

MR. HOROWITZ s

24

QUESTION:

25

No.

The court —

Was this pressed upon the court by

the United States Attorney?

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

MF. HOROWITZ;

It certainly was featured quite

2

heavily in the government’s motion for summary judgment,

3

the Oklahoma Press case, but it was not really discussed

4

by the Appellee and the court did not see fit to discuss

5

it either.

6

7

QUESTION;

Judge Van Sickle had Oklahoma

P re ss.

8

MF. HOROWITZ;

9

As we’ve stated in our briefs we view this as

10

a straightforward case governed by principles that have

11

been well settled by this Court.

12

QUESTION;

Yes, he did.

Mr. Horowitz, maybe I’ve already

13

asked it but I just want to be sure.

14

judgment but also in his opinion all he mentions is the

15

right to enter.

16

somehow did not get in the papers did he because the

17

strangest thing to me about this case is the judge's

18

total failure to mention anything about complying with

19

the su bpoena.

20

Not only in his

He did not write another opinion that

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, it is certainly strange.

21

At the beginning of the court’s opinion or at least at

22

the beginning of discussing the issues at the bottom of

23

page 6 A in framing the issue the court says in the last

24

paragraph there on page 6A "Lone Steer asserts that the

25

statutory scheme is constitutionally impermissible and

10
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that the records described in the administrative

2

subpoena issued in this case need not be produced except

3

in response to a warrant."

4

So the court certainly took, cognizance there

5

of the fact that there had been a subpoena issued, and

6

that's what was involved.

7

on to discuss Barlow's and then kind of falls back onto

8

this discussion of entry onto the premises.

9
10
11

QUESTION;

But then the court just goes

You thought it was so strange that

you suggested summary reversal.
KR. HOROWITZ;

We did suggest summary

12

reversal, but the court did not see fit to act on that

13

sugges tion.

14

The case is here today because of the direct

15

appeal provisions of Section 1252 in light of the

16

District Court's finding of unconstitutionality.

17

not because this case presents an unsettled

18

constitutional question.

19

It is

I would like if I might briefly to emphasize

20

just a few points in this connection.

At the outset let

21

me emphasize again that the only issue presented in this

22

case is the constitutionality of the subpoena duces

23

tecum served upon Appellee, that is, requiring the

24

production of documents off premises without resort to a

25

search warrant.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Perhaps because the validity of such subpoena

1

2

is so clearly established by this Court’s precedent

3

Appellee and the amicae supporting it have sought to

4

cloud

5

an attempted nonconsensual entry onto private premises.

this issue by suggesting that this case involves

This is simply not sc.

6

There is no question

7

here of an entry onto private premises without consent

8

as there was in Barlow’s.

9

attempt to enter and the Department of Labor’s general

10
11

policy

The government never made any

is not to make such entries.
From the time the subpoena was served almost

12

every document in the record perhaps with the exception

13

of the District Court’s opinion confirms that this

14

litigation has focused on the validity of the subpoena.

15

Only one week after the subpoena was served Appellee

16

wrote the government, sent a copy of this letter to the

17

District Court stating that it would not comply with the

18

subpoena because it was invalid under Barlow’s.

19

Appellee’s complaint, the government’s

20

petition to enforce this subpoena, the District Court's

21

own description of the issue presented in its opinion

22

and the motions for summary judgment all focus on the

23

issue of the validity of the subpoena .

24

Appellee’s contention is foreclosed by a long line of

25

precedent of this Court.

On this issue

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

In Oklahoma Press this Court unequivocally

2

held that an administrative subpoena, indeed in that

3

case a subpoena issued under the very statute involved

4

here,

5

governed by the requirements of the warrant clause.

6

That is, neither a warrant nor probable cause is

7

required for the issuance of a subpoena.

8
9

the Fair Labor Standards Act, a subpoena is net

The Court explained that a subpoena does not
involve any actual search of private matters.

It is a

10

search only in a theoretical sense, what the Court

11

termed a constructive search.

12

The Court concluded, therefore,

that a

13

subpoena is reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth

14

Amendment if the request is authorized by law, is net

15

indefinite or unduly burdensome and seeks documents that

16

are relevant to the investigation.

17

reaffirmed by this Court in Morton Salt and several

18

other subsequent cases and has been routinely and

19

uniformly applied to administrative subpoenas for the

20

last 40 years.

21

This rule has teen

Neither Appellee or the District Court

22

discusses Oklahoma Press and its progeny.

No defect in

23

the reasoning of the Court in those cases nor any reason

24

for concluding that those cases were wrongly decided has

25

been suggested.

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62B-0300

The sole basis for the decision below and for

1

2

Appellee's argument is the assumption that this long

3

line of cases has been wiped off the hooks overruled sub

4

silentio by Barlow's.

5

this assumption.

There is absolutely no basis for

Barlow's has nothing to do with this case or

6

7

with Oklahoma Press.

8

search, an entry onto a manufacturer's private business

9

premises and a search cf these premises for evidence of

10

Barlow's involved an actual

safety and health violations.
This is the precise sort of investigative tool

11

12

with which the Court in Oklahoma Press contrasted a

13

subpoena and drew a distinction.

14

suggest any erosion of the traditional distinction

15

between subpoenas and actual searches.

Barlow's did not

Indeed Barlow's relied heavily on See v. City

16
17

of Seattle an earlier case where the Court had

18

established a warrant requirement for fire inspections,

19

inspections that required an entry onto private

20

premises.

21

Court expressly reaffirmed the distinction drawn in

22

Oklahoma Press between subpoenas and actual searches and

23

reaffirmed the standards set forth there under which

24

such subpoenas are to be judged.

25

In the course of that decision, however, the

Barlow's and following See did not interfere

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

with these standards.

Morever, the problems with OSHft

2

inspections primarily concerned the Court in Barlow's.

3

That is, the unbridled expression of officers in the

4

field to conduct inspections and the unlimited nature of

5

the search involved do not exist with subpoenas.
The subpoena is not open ended.

6

It

7

specifically identifies the documents sought.

The

8

subpoena is not left to the unbridled discretion of the

9

officer in the field.
It may be issued only by the Sage Hour

10
11

administrator and enforced only by resort to adversary

12

court proceedings.

13

any doubt on the continued validity of Oklahoma Press or

14

on the validity of the subpoena returnable off premises

15

that was issued in this case.

In short, nothing in Barlow's casts

Thus, to repeat we believe that well settled

16
17

Supreme Court precedent clearly controls the disposition

18

of this case and requires reversal of the judgment

19

below.

20
21
22

Unless there are any questions, I will reserve
the remainder of my time.
QUESTION*

I have one, Mr. Horowitz.

Again, I

23

do not think it is really raised here but do you think

24

there are any limits in addition to those spelled out in

25

Oklahoma Press on the government's subpoena power?

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

Could a person whose records are being subpoenaed, for

2

example, seek a protective order from the court on the

3

grounds that he’d been singled out or was being

4

harrassed and, therefore, the subpoena wouldn’t issue?

5

Are there any limits?
MR. HOROWITZS

6

I am not sure whether the

7

Fourth Amendment would give any protection or not

8

against sort of being singled out.

9

due process clause or something could have some sort of

It might be that the

10

selective prosecution kind, but I think it would be a

11

difficult standard to meet certainly.

They were turned away.
Right.

Mr. Peterson, you used the word

did not seek to give the Court that impression.

QUESTION:

MR. PETERSON:

12

QUESTION;

13

You are not arguing that?
We’re saying —
Anyone

could enter it, could they not?
MR. PETERSON:

15

QUESTION:

17

No.

That is a public place.

14

16

No, Your Honor, definitely

Yes, it is. Your Honor.

How else would they serve the

subpoena except to enter it?
MR. PETERSON:

Your Honor, in the first

18

instance what they sought to do was to conduct the

19

investigation.

QUESTION:

21

they thought to do.

We are not concerned about what
What did they do?

MR. PETERSON:

They informed us by way of a

letter that they were going to attempt to conduct the

investigation and if they were prohibited -- That was

the word used — if they were prohibited from conducting

QUESTION;

Kr. Peterson, the stipulation goes

on and says they did properly serve the subpoena.

S

HR. PETERSON;

6

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

The subpoena commands the

7

production of a person to testify and to bring with him

8

certain records to the Federal Building in Bismarck.
MR. PETERSON;

9
10

QUESTION;

11

HR. PETERSON;

Yes, Your Honor.

Why did you not do that?
Your Honor, at that point prior

12

to that the issue was under Section 11 whether or not

13

the inspection powers of the Labor Department were

14

limited by the Fourth Amendment as interpreted by

15

Barlow's, and the issue before the Court as the Court

16

perceived it and as we perceived it we wanted a

17

declaratory judgment as to whether or not the Labor

18

Department did have the right to conduct the

19

investigation without the consent of the owner.
QUESTION;

20

Do you understand the District

21

Court to have ruled that you did not have to comply with

22

the subpoena.

23

MR. PETERSON;

24

QUESTION;

25

Yes, Your Honor.

What reason did he give for that

ruling ?

MR. PETERSONs

1

He did not really give a reason

2

for th at ruling other than to say that the inspection

3

power under Section 11 of the Fair Labor Standards Act

4

was cl early in his mind at least subject to the warrant

5

cla use under the Fourth Amendment as interpreted in

6

Barlow *s.
QUESTION;

7
8

He talked only of entries onto the

premis es.
MR. PETERSONs

9

QUESTION*

10

Yes, Your Honor.

The subpoena asks for production

11

elsewh ere.

Is there any reason why you should not

12

comply with a subpoena to produce elsewhere?
MR. PETERSON;

13

The subpoena as we understand

14

the su bpoena is an enforcement device as a part of

15

Sectio n 11*s conferring of inspection powers to enter

16

and in spect the premises.
QUESTION;

17
18

Had they not first tried to get in

would you be making the same argument?
MR. PETERSON;

19

I believe. Your Honor, that

20

either Section 11 is subject to the warrant clause or it

21

isn *t.

22

the La bor Department did not or left undisturbed the

23

j u d gm e nt with respect to entry.

24
25

I believe that it is subject to Section 11, and

The judgement with resoect to entry right now
stands that Section 11 is subject to the warrant

clause
QUESTION:

2

Well, let me give you a

3

hypothetical.

The same type of subpoena is issued to

4

another corporation which has only been in business a

5

week.

Would you be arguing the same thing?

6

MR. PETERSON:

7

QUESTION:

I would argue —

I said only been a week because I

8

do not want anything in the past to have anything to io

9

with it.
MR. PETERSON:

10

I would argue there, Your

11

Honor,

12

A subpoena can be enforced under Barlow principles, and

13

it would be subject to the —

that a subpoena is subject to Barlow principles.

Yes, they have subpoena power

I believe was limited by Barlow's -QUESTION:

17
18

So they have no subpoena power.

How would they exercise the

subpoena power?
MR. PETERSON:

19

I think what this Court has to

20

do consistent with Barlow's is to look at the entire

21

investigatory scheme and see that a subpoena is being

22

used and enforced in Federal District Court, and the

23

test there would be whether or not the subpoena and an

24

enforcement would be the functional equivalent of a

25

warran t.

MR. PETERSON:

We believe. Your Honor, that

because of the entry provisions of this particular

25

statute, Section 11, which there is no question in my

mind,

2

and apparently there is no question in the Labor

3

Department's mind, is subject to the warrant clause cn

4

Barlow's.

5

Section 11 is subject to the warrant clause; however,

6

the subpoena is not which is the enforcement device.

7

there is no question in the District Court's mind

It is very difficult for me to then say

I believe that essentially the cases are the

8

same, Barlow's and Lone Steer.

9

occurred when entry was denied and an enforcement

10

mechanism under a particular statute was utilized.

11

The only difference

In the Barlow's case it involved a compulsory

12

process to enter, and as I read Barlow's the Labor

13

Department did not contend that that compulsory process

14

was the equivalent of a warrant.

15

it could be viewed as such in one of your footnotes.

16

You did indicate that

The same is true in this particular case.

We

17

have to look, at the enforcement mechanism of Section 11,

18

and in this case it is the subpoena, a subpoena that is

19

issued by the Labor Department itself without regard to

20

probable cause and without properly limiting the scope

21

of the investigation to the purpose or the probable

22

cause involved.

23

Again, I would have to iterate and reiterate

24

that the case involved a declaratory judgment at a

25

particular time.

On February 1, 1981 there was a

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

dispute as to whether or not the Labor Department had a

2

right to come in and conduct an investigation over the

3

objection of an owner.

4

When Lone Steer objected twice through its

5

attorney that you cannot come in without a warrant cr

6

its functional equivalent, the Labor Department then

7

cited in its letter its inspection powers under Section

8

11 to enter and conduct an inspection.

9

there was a dispute as far as the District Court was

At that point

10

concerned as to whether or not the Labor Department did

11

in fact have a right to enter and inspect.

12

Following the initiation of that law suit the

13

Labor Department despite all these protestations through

14

the legal counsel and through the court system the labor

15

Department still sought to conduct that inspection on

16

the premises of Lone Steer.

17

QUESTION*

It is —

Sc what you say is basically you

18

are entitled to a declaratory judgment that would say

19

the Labor Department does not have the authority tc

20

enter and inspect notwithstanding —

21

MS. PETERSON*

22

QUESTION:

Without the consent of —

Without the consent of the owner

23

notwithstanding that we might resolve the subpoena

24

question in favor of the government.

25

two distinct issues I take it.

You see them as

27

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 6204300

MR. PETERSON*

1

Yes, they are two distinct

2

issues, but if Section 11 is subject to the warrant

3

clause under a Barlow's test type of analysis it seems

4

clear to me that you have to also apply that analysis to

5

the enforcement mechanism of that right under Section

6

11

.
In fact the Labor Department is saying that it

7

8

is seeking to inspect the documents under the subpoena

9

under Section 11.

10
11

They are citing Section 11 and

Section 9.
I seriously question whether or not the Labor

12

Department can conduct its investigation without

13

utilizing the authority of Section 11 which is a right

14

to enter provision.
