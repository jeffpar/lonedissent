ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHAIF OF THE PETITIONER

MR . FREY:

Thank you , Mr. Chief Justic e, a nd

may it please the Court.
The issue before the Court today is wh ether it

12

should extend the Fourth Am endm ent exclusionary ru le

13

heretofore applied by it only in the context of criminal

14

prosecutions and quasi-criminal forfeiture proceedings

15

to civil deportation hearings.

16

Respondents Lopez and Sandoval are Mexican

17

nationals who entered the United States illegally nearly

18

ten years ago.

19

after his illegal entry by an INS agent at his place of

20

employment, and each made admissions of his illegal

21

alien status following his apprehension.

22

Each was apprehended within a few months

These admissions were utilized at the

23

deportation hearings to establish that respondents were

24

not U.S. citizens, a fact that I might say is virtually

25

impossible for the Immigration Service to prove by ether

3

1

means in cases of persons who enter the United States

2

without inspection, and these admissions formed the

3

basis of the decision ordering

4

their deportation.

They appealed to the Court of Appeals and an

5

en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit held that Sandoval's

6

admission of his alien status was the fruit of an

7

unlawful arrest.

8

the record did not establish whether or not his arrest

9

was unlawful.

10

As tc respondent Lopez, it held that

It then turned to the question whether the

11

exclusionary rule applies tc deportation hearings, and

12

concluding that it does, reversed the order of

13

deportation with respect to Sandoval, and remanded for

14

further proceedings with respect to Lopez.

15

Now, let me begin my discussion by saying —

16

QUESTION:

Nr. Frey, may I ask —

17

MB. FREY:

Certainly.

18

QUESTION:

-- before you begin, respondent's

19

brief has this statement.

"Contrary to the government's

20

characterization of the decision below as extending the

21

exclusionary rule to an entirely new category of cases

22

and creating a new barrier tc enforcement of immigration

23

laws,

24

practice.

25

investigative and prosecutorial functions in a legal

it merely marks a return to long-standing former
Until 1979, the INS performed its

4

1

regime in which the exclusionary rule was thought to

2

apply. "

3

It then goes on tc say that really what ycu

4

are asking is abandonment of the exclusionary rule after

5

over 60 years of applicability.

6

that?

7

MR. FREYs

Shat do you say about

Well, I guess I have two things to

8

say about that.

The first is that I am first addressing

9

the question of this Court's jurisprudence and what it

10

would mean in terms of this Court's jurisprudence tc

11

decide that the exclusionary rule is applicable to

12

deportation proceedings, and as to that point, I think

13

it is clear that it would be an extension in the sense

14

that the Court has never applied the exclusionary rule

15

to civil proceedings of any kind, and it has never

16

applied the exclusionary rule to a non-punitive

17

proceeding the purpose of which is tc determine status.

18

So, from the standpoint of this Court's

19

jurisprudence, while it is in a sense a question of

20

semantics, I think it is fair for us to characterize a

21

decision affirming as an extension.

22

Now, there is a second —

23

QUESTI0N4

24
25

Well, has there been a practice for

60 years of recognizing the exclusionary rule?
MR. FREY i

That is a point that I intend tc

5

1

address.

2

not been in any way a significant feature of

3

deportation —

4

I do not think it has been a practice.

It has

QUESTION:

He, but has it been a practice at

6

MR. FREY:

Hell, I am not sure —

7

QUESTION;

— in deportation proceedin gs?

8

MR. FREY;

I am net sure how to answer that

5

9

all —

questi on.

There is not a single decision of the Beard

10

of Imm igration Appeals or a single decision of a federal

11

court since 1920 in which it has been held that evidence

12

should

13

there has never been a case before the — there is only

14

one ca se, and that is the case of respondent San deval,

15

in whi ch it was held that someone should not be deported

16

becaus e of the application of the Fourth Amendme nt

17

exclus ionary rule.

18

be suppressed in a deportation proceeding , sc

Now, it is true that there are cases i n which

19

the co urts, the BIA, at least, had considered th e

20

questi on whether an arrest was lawful, whether c ertain

21

eviden ce was lawfully obtained.

22

cases,

23

period , it was either determined that there was no

24

illega lity or that there was enough ether eviden ce of

25

deport ability, so it never was necessary for the BIA

In every one of those

and there are net very many over this 60- year

1

actually to hold yea or nay as to whether the

2

exclusionary rule was applicable.
And when Matter of Sandoval, which is the

3

1979

4

decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, came

5

before the board, the board concluded four to one that

6

this was effectively a question of first impression for

7

them, and that they were free to make a decision on the

8

merits and not bound by precedent.

9

dissenting member of the board who felt it had beer the

10

There was one

practi ce.
Now, I am not sure what to make of it frcm the

11
12

standpoint of this Court, except I think it is quite

13

important to understand that if this Court decides today

14

that the exclusionary rule should apply to deportation

15

proceedings, that will work a dramatic change in the

16

nature of the deportation process frcm what it was

17

before.

18

QUESTION;

What about the situation of the

19

egregious violation that might constitute in and of

20

itself a violation of the due process clause?

21

Board of Immigration Appeals has adopted a different

22

view as to —

23

ME. FREYs

Now, the

As to that narrow class of cases,

24

and I believe there are two instances where it has

25

actually found that evidence should be suppressed under

7

1

a due process rationale.

2
3

QUESTION;

This is, I think —

Do you agree with that?

Is that

required in your view in a purely civil proceeding?

4

ME. FREY;

I don't believe it has done it — I

5

don't believe it has done it because it thought it

6

constitutionally required it.

7

the Attorney General determined on reviewing the

8

decision in Matter of Sandoval that it should be done.

9
10

QUESTION;

It has done it because

And what is your position?

Is it

constitutionally required under those circumstances?

11

MR. FREY;

My position, I think, would be that

12

it is not constitutionally required, but it is a very

13

different thing to say that the Board cf Immigration

14

Appeals in its discretion should determine what kind of

15

evidence it will receive in its proceedings for the

16

courts to tell the Board of Immigration Appeals what

17

kind of evidence it should receive.

18

QUESTION;

How about the courts?

Do you think

19

as am atter of deterrence. although not constitutio

20

requir ed, that in the egregious situation where the

21

a viol ation of due process that the rule should be

22

applie d?

23

MR. FREY;

You are talking about in the

24

context cf Fourth Amendment, evidence obtained in

25

violation of the Fourth Amendment --

8

1

QUESTIONI

Y es

2

HR. FREYi

-- but egregious violations?

3

QUESTION:

Right.

4

MR. FREY;

Well, in the context of the courts,

5

we do have a judicially adopted exclusionary rule which

6

does require the exclusion of illegally seized evidence,

7

and we have not suggested in the cases that the Court

8

has previously heard that it should modify the rule so

9

far as to allow the admission of such evidence.

So, in

10

the context of criminal prosecutions,

11

not our position that this evidence should be deemed

12

admissible, but I think it is quite a different question

13

as to when the courts are reviewing the decisions of the

14

agency.

15

at least, it is

I think it would be tenable perhaps to say

16

that even that kind of evidence is admissible, but of

17

course cases like Verochin against California suggested

18

even before Mapp that there was a restriction on the use

19

of such evidence in criminal prosections.

20

I don't know if I have fully answered your

21

question, but I think that in terms of this Court's own

22

jurisprudence, the only holding that really has any

23

applicability is its decision in Janis, United States

24

against Janis, and while that case clearly imposes

25

substantial restrictions on the use of the exclusionary

9

1

rule in civil proceedings, we concede that its reasoning

2

does not foreclose the possible extension cf the

3

exclusionary rule to certain types of civil cases.

4

Sow, for those who already entertain

5

substantial doubts about the wisdom of the exclusionary

6

rule and its existing applications, they may prefer to

7

simply draw the line, and to resist its extension to

8

entirely new contexts such as non-punitive civil

9

proceedings.

But the Court does not have to go so far

10

or adopt such a broad rule to decide this case.

11

we think it can decide this case by employing the

12

traditional cost-benefit analysis that it has used in

13

deciding the application of the exclusionary rule in

14

connection with various aspects of criminal proceedings,

15

and it is to that analysis that I would like to turn.

16

Rather,

But before I address the costs and benefits of

17

applying the exclusionary rule in deportation

18

proceedings, I think it is useful to take a little

19

journey through the locking glass, as it were, to the

20

imaginary world that respondents depict.

21

here rests critically on the following series of

22

assertions.

23

Their argument

First, that there has long been and continues

24

to be a widespread pattern cf Fourth Amendment

25

violations by INS agents.

Second, that there has long

10

1

existed prior to the BIA's decision in Matter of

2

Sandoval in 1979 a meaningful and substantial

3

exclusionary rule remedy in deportation proceedings.

Third,

that this state of affairs imposed no serious

Fourth, that the decision in Matter of

8
9

Sandoval created a situation in which open season was

10

declared on the Fourth Amendment rights of Hispanic

11

Americans.

12

exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings can restore

13

those rights.

And fifth, that only a restoration of the

14

Now, if these various assertions were

15

accurate, a case could be made for respondent's

16

position, but they are fundamentally inaccurate.

as the Court of Appeals itself noted, there is no

evidence of serious or widespread Fourth Amendment

But what is so striking about this case is the

inability of anybody to point to any substantial

4

Secondly, and this is the point I made in

responding to Justice Erennan's question before, it is

clear that the exclusionary rule has never been a

15

MR. FREY;

If there has never been a proilem ,

Well, I don't think so at all.

I

16

think the dilemma is net ours in this respect, because

17

the problem that we are concerned about is not so much

18

that the occasional illegal alien will escape

19

deportation as a result of the application of the

20

exclusionary rule, but the systemic consequences.

21

what happened, I think, quite clearly prior to 1979 is

22

that there was no general understanding that the

23

exclusionary rule applied, that people would

24

occasionally raise claims that dealt with the legality --

25

QUESTION;

Didn't the standard text on

HR. FREYt

2

Well, the standard text, I noticed

3

that the Court of Appeals cites the

4

standard text, which says it applies.

5

Sandoval was decided in 1979, so I am not sure how much

6

weight should be given to a text that says it applies.

No, but the alien who is*seeking to

There are some BIA opinions that

HR. FREY;

I am told they write about 2,COO,

of which about 200 are published as precedents.

16

QUESTION:

Do you have any idea what

2

percentage of those opinions deal with Fourth Amendment

3

issues ?

4

HR. FREY:

I would say less than

1 percent,

5

and the point is that every single one of these people

6

-- look at the class of cases we are talking about.

7

Most aliens who are apprehended entered without

8

inspection.

9

evidence we have of their alienage is the admission that

They are arrested some place.

The only

10

they have made after their arrest that they are in fact

natives of Mexico or wherever they may be.
Each one of these people could raise a

13

plausible Fourth Amendment claim.

14

QUESTION;

Is that typically true, that the

15

only evidence you have of alienage is their own

16

admission?

17

MR. FREY:

The way the procedure now works is

18

that the burden is on the INS to establish by clear and

19

convincing evidence alienage, and at that point the

20

burden shifts to the alien.

21

how the INS can prove that somebody is not a citizen

Didn’t we have a case last year

9

MR. FREY4

That was a criminal prosecution.

10

QUESTION;

That’s right.

11

MR. FREY:

The question there was not the

12

alienage of the person at deportation proceedings.

13

There are 70,000 deportation proceedings a year.

14

whole system is workable only because there are these

15

reliable admissions of alien status which are

16

introduced, and deportability is not an issue in these

17

deportation proceedings.

18

such as discretionary relief.

19

QUESTION;

20
21
22

They look to other things,

There are 70,000?

I thought there

were a million a year.
MR. FREY:

There are a million -- over a

But if you decide this case against us, I have

11
12

no doubt that there will be a tremendous impact on

deportation proceedings in the future.

14

may be worthwhile, and I would like to turn to the

15

question of whether the benefits from applying the

16

exclusionary rule in terms of deterring illegal searches

17

and seizures by immigration officers are worth the

18

costs.

Now, that impact

First of all, I'd like to make a general point

19
20

about the perspective from which this issue should be

21

approached.

22

this Court has extended the exclusionary rule to a

23

significant new class of cases and that was Kapp against

24

Ohio.

25

which

There has only been one time before that

There it was confronted not only with the case in

Amendment violation, but with a situation in which the

2

exclusionary rule seemed tc he the only way to curt a

3

nationwide epidemic of police violations of the Fourth

4

Amendm ent.

And the Court of Appeals itself

recognized

that there is nothin comparable to that that anybody is

aware of in the immigration context.

QUESTION:

It is a privilege against

ME. FREY:

It's the same privilege that a

witness in a civil case would have, but it is not a

8

privilege against use cf compelled testimony in the

9

deportation proceeding itself.

Presumably these people

10

could be immunized and compelled to testify in the

11

deportation proceeding.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

But your proposition doesn’t affect

the criminal deportation hearing?
MR. FREY;

Well, there is not a criminal

15

deportation hearing.

It would not affect a criminal

16

prosecution for immigration law violations.

17

QUESTION:

It wouldn't go that far?

18

MR. FREY:

It does not.

No.

That is not at

19

all the question, and that is certainly not the question

20

that is important to the administration of the

21

immigration system, because that is a very small part,

22

and the deportation hearings are a very major part.

23

Now, I would like to look first briefly -- let

24

me just say that the point that I was making before

25

about the Court of Appeals’

analysis is that to say that

23

1

this -- these arrests are within the zone of primary

2

interest because what they are looking toward is the

3

deportation of the aliens is to raise an issue for this

4

Court,

5

there would be no issue under Janis.

6

clear that the exclusionary rule wouldn't apply.

because if you didn't at least get that far,

7

It would be quite

But I agree that there is an issue for this

8

Court to consider which requires balancing the potential

9

benefits in terms of deterrence of misconduct from

10

applying the exclusionary rule against the special costs

11

that may exist in the deportation context.

12

Now, in terms of the benefits, it is n.ct, we

13

believe, accurate to equate the effect of the

14

application of the exclusionary rule on immigration

15

officers with the effect of the application of the

16

exclusionary rule in criminal prosecutions on police

17

officers.

18

differences between this case and Napp that make it far

19

less likely that application of the exclusionary rule

20

will provide important incremental incentives to lawful

ME. FREY;

The question for this Court,

I want to make the point, and I will have to

So that the degree of probability that the

4

Now, as the Sandoval case itself shows, the

5

remedy cannot be applied with precision in the

essentially said is, the officer couldn't remember the

8

precise details of his encounter with Kr.

we are going to suppress the statement, all against a

background in which it seems to me quite clear that in

all probability there was no Fourth Amendment

14

violat ion.
So, I think it is very important, and we made

15
16

the same point in connection with the so-called good

17

faith exception to the exclusionary rule, that when you

18

are — as to these cases where it is difficult to

19

determine whether there has been a Fourth Amendment

20

violation, applying the exclusionary rule won't work the

21

way you want it to work.
QUESTIONS

Kr. Frey, how rigid is the burden

HR. FREYs

Well, I am sure that we would argue

that the conventional rule in criminal cases it that if

you have a warrantless search or seizure, the burden is

3

on the government to show probable cause.

QUESTION:

But surely the mere absence of a

warrant in an arrest of this kind of case wouldn't put

the burden on the agent to defend the arrest, would it?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY L. HEEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. HEEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

22

please the Court, at the heart of this case is the

23

question of whether the Fourth Amendment will remain

24

enforceable in the immigration context.

25

law enforcement setting, the Court seven years ago in

31

In the criminal

1

Weeks and later in Matt versus Ohio adopted the

2

exclusionary rule as the c'nly way to give life and

3

meaning to the Fourth Amendment.

4

Although deportation proceedings have been

5

given a civil label, they are completely analogous in

6

this regard to criminal proceedings.

7

deportation proceedings functions in the same way,

8

serves the same values, and provides the same effective

safeguard against arbitrary intrusions by government

The rule in

officials.
I plan to address here four principal reasons

12

why the government's arguments for a different treatment

13

are invalid.

14

15

The Fourth Amendment protects society generally, not

16

just the rights of those accused of criminal violations.

17

First, the Fourth Amendment privacy rights

Second, the degree of deterrence is the same.

18

As in the criminal context, it is direct and

19

substantial.

20

will effectively enforce Fourth Amendment rights.

21

alternatives urged by the INS in this context are no

22

different than those which have been rejected as

23

inadequate and insufficient in the criminal setting.

24

And fourth, the social costs of applying the rule to

25

deportation proceedings are no greater than the social

Third, there are no other remedies which

Moreover, the immigration system itself has

rule without excessive costs.

QUESTION:

How widespread was that?

6

MS. HEEN;

Well, as explained in greater

7

detail in our brief, the —
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, Mr. Frey takes very vigorous

issue with what you said in your brief.

10

MS. HEEN:

Well,

the administrative practice

11

and the judicial history both demonstrate that there was

12

a substantial body of both administrative cases and

13

judicial review cases looking at the Fourth Amendment

14

violat ion .

15

QUESTION:

Are they cited?

16

HS. HEEN:

They are cited in our brief.

And

17

in addition, the Board of Immigration Appeals set up a

18

procedure for examining motions for suppression, placed

19

the burden on the alien to show that the conduct was

20

illegal, and then once that prima facie showing of

21

illegality was established, the burden then would shift

22

to the government to show the lawfulness of the conduct

23

in a particular situation.

24

the administrative practice —

25

QUESTION:

So it is clear that under

When did the BIA do that, what you

However/ prior to that time, it had also
It set up

Now, with regard to Mr. Frey’s argument that

7

8

there is a paucity of decisions in this area, let me

9

just address the population that we are dealing with

10

with regard to the suppression motions.

First of all,

11

the target population is in general a group that is

12

poor.

13

in general represented by counsel.

It is legally unsophisticated, and they are not

Secondly, the nature of the bureaucracy itself

14
15

tends to understate the amount of the problem here,

16

because first of all immigration law judge decisions are

17

not reported. A substantial number of Board of

18

Immigration Appeals decisions are not reported.

19

just heard, it is something like 10 percent per year.

20

And finally, there are built-in incentives in the system

21

so that people tend to opt for voluntary departure

22

rather than to insist on their right to a deportation

23

hearing.

And all of these factors —

24

QUESTION:

Well, is that bad?

25

MS. HEEN:

I am not suggesting that —

34

As we

1

QUESTION;

If people opt for voluntary

2

deportation when they admit that they have illegally

3

entered the country?

4

MS. HEEN;

There is a mechanism set up so that

5

they can opt for voluntary departure, and in that way

6

avoid some of the consequences with regard to being

7

detained while waiting for a hearing, and --

8
9

QUESTION;

Since you analogize this — you

seem to think a deportation proceeding equates to a

10

criminal proceeding, is that voluntary deportation

11

somewhat analogous to a guilty plea in a criminal case?

12

MS. HEEN;

It is analogous to a plea

13

bargaining situation.

14

issue of whether or not the reported decisions

15

themselves indicate the amount of significance that an

16

exclusionary rule could have in terms of applying it in

17

this context, it is clear that the number of decisions

18

themselves would not fully indicate the amount of impact

19

the decision could have on the general training and

20

supervision of officers in this context.

21

However, getting back to the

A good example in the criminal setting is the

22

reaction to this Court's decision in Delaware versus

23

Prouse, when the random traffic stop practice was

24

invalidated.

25

the chief of police issued a telex to officers informing

For example, in the District of Columbia

35

1

them of this new practice with regard to traffic stops.

2

The same sort of mechanism applies in the immigration

3

context, so that when the Court of Appeals is reviewing

4

the Board of Immigration Appeals* decisions with regard

5

to the Fourth Amendment, the judicial review establishes

6

the standards under which these officers will conduct

7

their future investigations.

8

In Matter of Sandoval, the Board of

9

Immigration Appeals really turned its back, on its prior

10

history, and decided in large part because of the civil

11

nature cf the proceeding that it would no longer apply

Next, with regard to the deterrent effect in

17

this context, as in the criminal setting, excluding

18

illegally obtained evidence in deportation proceedings

19

would exert a substantial deterrent effect on

20

unconstitutional conduct.

21

deportation of illegal aliens, not criminal prosecution,

22

is the primary concern of immigration officers.

23

Obtaining evidence cf deportation is therefore in the

24

officer’s zone of primary interest.

25

The government concedes that

In addition, there is no question here that

37

1

the offending INS officers work for the same federal

2

agency which seeks to use the unlawfully obtained

3

evidence in their case in chief.

4

law enforcement goal and purpose, and the agency

5

utilizes a large investigative force in which to perform

6

this function.

7

therefore, INS agents are pushed by the pressures of

8

their jobs to the very limits cf the Fourth Amendment.

9

They share a common

By the very nature of this process,

There are pressures on the agents to apprehend

10

large numbers of deportable aliens rather than to

11

concentrate on whether or not their apprehensions comply

12

with constitutional standards.

13

this case a demonstrable need for a deterrent» sanction

14

in immigration investigations.

15

There is therefore in

Here, in addition, although the government

16

maintains that in this case there is not a serious

17

penalty with regard to civil deportation proceedings,

18

this Court has recognized in the past that deportation

19

can be a severe punishment.

20

banishment or exile, and in the words cf the Court, it

21

can mean the loss of all that makes life worth living.

22

It can be the equivalent of

In many cases, the civil consequence of a

23

deportation proceeding can be of greater importance to

24

the individual and also the law enforcement goals of the

25

system than imposition cf a corresponding criminal

sanction for exactly the same conduct.

It can be

But the reason — the difference

1

that occurs to me as I listen to your argument is that

the other areas, because you are talking about arresting

MS. HEENs

6

Well,

the problem with regard to

7

the reliance on civil damage actions as a surrogate for

8

the rule in this context is that first of all the nature

9

of the population, which I already mentioned.

The

10

citizens who may be apprehended because they work

11

alongside illegal aliens are probably a population which

12

is very unlikely tc have the resources and the access to

13

legal representation in order to pursue civil damage

14

actions, and as the government has conceded in its

15

brief,

16

is the good faith immunity defense on the part of INS

17

office rs.

Bivens actions are very rarely successful.

There

And with regard to the deterrent impact of a

18
19

civil damage action, the real question is with regard to

20

those instances which would not be tremendously flagrant

21

or egregious.

22

the incentive for INS officers to err on the side cf

23

constitutional behavior, and therefore cannot provide an

24

effective alternative tc the exclusionary rule in this

25

con tex t.

The civil damage actions do not provide

40

1

The same is true with regard to the other

2

alternatives which the government relies on.

For

3

example, declaratory and injunctive actions.

Now, as

4

outlined last term in City of los Angeles versus Lyons,

5

because of equitable and standing prerequisites, it is

6

very difficult to obtain injunctive relief.

7

relief can be obtained only where the victims of the

8

unlawful actions can establish that INS would subject

9

them to another unlawful search or seizure.

Injunctive

10

Moreover, it must be shown under Rizzo versus

11

Goode that the actions are a result of a policy adopted

12

by INS.

13

in rare cases, and only after the deterrent mechanism

14

has already failed with regard to the institution of an

15

unconstitutional policy.

16

Therefore, the injunction can be obtained only

Reliance on internal rules, training,

and

17

discipline have not been effective as an accepted

18

alternative in the — acceptable alternative in the

19

criminal setting, and in the case of INS, has been used

20

in the past only to sanction the most flagrant and

21

appalling misconduct.

22

There are three major failures of the INS

23

disciplinary procedures.

24

applied to Fourth

25

has been no recordkeeping.

First of all, it is not

Amendment violations.

Secondly, there

And thirdly, the procedures

41

1

are themselves inadequate on their face.
With regard to the first point, that INS dees

2
3

not in fact discipline officers for Fourth Amendment

4

violations,

5

applied to INS officers for Fourth Amendment violations

6

since the Matter of Sandoval decision in 1979.

7

the only examples cf discipline that INS has produced

8

for the last four fiscal years are truly criminal and

9

flagrant misconduct.

INS can point to no disciplinary sanctions

In fact,

Three officers were terminated or suspended

10
11

because of rape of aliens, three for physical brutality

12

of federal undercover agents posing as aliens, and in

13

one case a supervisory agent abused and detained a

14

United States citizen for 19 hours without food or

15

water,

and transported him to Mexico.
Therefore, it is obvious from the way that the

16
17

internal procedures have been applied that INS is net

18

applying high priority in terms of disciplining officers

19

for Fourth Amendment violations.
Secondly, INS keeps no adequate records of

20
21

Fourth

Amendment violations, and does not and therefore

22

cannot monitor the effectiveness of its training

23

procedures.

24

there are significant inadequacies with regard to the

25

procedures themselves on their face.

And third, as we mentioned in our brief,

42

1

Finally, I would like to address —

2

QUESTION:

Ms. Heen, in your brief, at

3

Footnote 9 on Page 30, you refer to the fact that

patterns of INS conduct described and reported in cases

evidence widespread Fourth Amendment violations by

6

immigration officers.

which of course was reversed by us yesterday;

10

Are these the theme of all your citations?

11

Are they pretty well overruled by our decision

13

MS. HEES:

Nc.

With regard to LaDue versus

14

Nelson, Mendoza versus

15

these cases, although only the Mendoza versus INS case

16

arouse subsequent to the Matter of Sandoval decision,

17

are really used as examples of the kind of conduct which

18

INS officers have overstepped the boundaries with regard

19

to compliance with the Fourth Amendment in their

20

investigations.

21

INS, and Marquez versus Kiley,

The government places great reliance with

regard to the issue of whether or not there are

23

widespread violations in this context, and I think that

24

we would be closing our eyes to the problem which exists

25

with regard to an area of law enforcement where there

are over a million apprehensions per year.

held that there is really no Fourth Amendment in the

There, the Court

rights.

13

single federal agency, with regard to the application of

the exclusionary rule, which has always applied in the

15

context of federal criminal enforcement since Weeks,

16

would also apply in terms of the rationale.

If that were the rationale, the FBI, also one

In addition to the reported cases, with regard

17
18

to the indication of the problem in this area, and also

19

the nature of the population and the nature of the

20

bureaucracy with regard to this, I may just point cut

21

that in terms of the record in this particular case,

22

both of the issues arose during a time period when the

23

exclusionary rule applied in deportation proceedings,

24

and therefore there was no attempt to make this kind of

25

record

below with regard tc the extent of the problem.

44

1

Finally ,

I wculd like to address with regard

2

to alternatives the government’s reliance on the due

3

process exclusionary rule.

4

that this is a discretionary rule, and was not adopted

5

as a constitutional requirement, but in terms of the

6

actual

7

decision in Hatter of Toro, and prior to that in its

8

unpublished decision in In re Ramira-Cordova, it is

9

clear that the Eoard of Immigration Appeals felt that it

The government maintains

language of the Board of Immigration Appeals’

10

was compelled under the due process clause to apply the

11

exclusionary rule for egregious Fourth Amendment

12

violations, and therefore it is analogous in some

13

respects to the rule which was adopted by the Court in

14

Rochen versus California and later discussed in the

15

Irvine versus California case.
The problem with regard to relying on this

16
17

rule as an effective alternative is that basically it

18

rewrites the Fourth Amendment in the immigration

19

context.

20

violations wculd be permitted in this context.

21

fails to provide clear standards for application of the

22

exclusionary rule, and this is a problem which was

23

addressed in the Irvine decision in the criminal

24

contex t.

25

In other words, unreasonable but less severe
It also

And finally, because it applies to intentional

45

1

misconduct, it may require inquiry intc the subjective

2

state of mind of the officer.

3

exclusionary rule dees not provide adequate protection

4

of Fourth Amendment values.

Thus the due process

I would like to next address the issue of the

5
6

societal costs involved.

The social costs of applying

7

the rule in this context provide no basis for a

8

distinction between deportation proceedings and criminal

9

proceedings, yet the government argues that the cost to

10

society of applying the rule in this context is greater

11

than we can afford, even greater than the cost borne by

12

the criminal justice system. That argument should be

13

rejected for the following three reasons.
First, the immigration system has functioned

14
15

under the rule in the past without excessive cost.

16

it presently functions under a due process exclusionary

17

rule.

18

for violation of INS regulations, and suppression

19

motions are also ruled upon with regard to the

20

voluntariness of statements and the voluntariness under

21

the Fifth Amendment.

22

And

For example, suppression motions are permitted

Applying the rule in deportation proceedings

23

therefore will not mark a change in procedure, and will

24

not require the system to adapt to something which has

25

not already functioned quite adequately in the past.

46

1

The government’s attempt to label the rule’s

2

application as a judicial licensing of unlawful conduct

3

is simply a red herring in this case.

4

of aliens will result as a consequence of applying the

5

rule in this context at any time independent, untainted

6

evidence of alienage may support a deportation order.

7

In fact, as the reported cases show, that is extremely

8

common in this context.

9

No special class

In addition, the government fails to note that

10

once the due process exclusionary rule is applied in

11

this context, and a deportation proceeding is terminated

12

as a result of that suppression motion, an alien also is

13

released, and that same person can later be apprehended

14

on the basis of independent tips and all the other

15

enforcement mechanisms that the agency uses to apprehend

16

illegal aliens.

decision in which the Board of Immigration Appeals

applied independent evidence in order to deport someone

And in

1

that case, which was decided in 1972, the immigration

law judge had suppressed evidence of deportability at

the original hearing.

received from an informant information that the person

was in this country illegally.

That hearing was terminated, and

Therefore, on the basis of that independent

source of information, the Board of Immigration Appeals

9

upheld the deportation order.

That provides an example

10

of how the system has been able to work under the rule

11

in the past, and that same sort of evidence can be used

12

in the future in order to deport those who may h.e

13

released as a result of application of the exclusionary

14

rule.
QUESTION*

15

May I ask you this question, Ms.

16

Heen?

Cne of their arguments is not just hew it works

17

in a particular case, but rather that if we decide the

18

way you urge us to, that there will be an opinion cn the

19

books that will stimulate a large number of motions that

20

have not been filed in the past, and both in the 70,000

21

contested cases and in the 900,000 unccntested cases

22

there will be a very great practical change in the way

23

these matters are handled.

24

Would you like to comment on that?

25

MS. HEEN;

Well, there may be some slight

48

1

increase in the number of suppression motions, which may

2

be tied to the increased enforcement activity of the INS

3

at the present time, but in terms of looking at the past

4

history of applying the rule in this context, as

5

mentioned earlier, the leading treatise in the field,

6

going back to its original editions, had stated that it

7

was undisputed that evidence obtained illegally may be

8

suppressed in deportation hearings.

9

Therefore, it was a part of the recognized

10

administrative practice that such suppression motions

11

could be filed.

J2

suppression motions, not just Fourth Amendment

13

suppression motions, which are filed in the context cf

suppression motions, as pointed out by board member

20

illegality in order to support the suppression motion

21

itself, and under the mechanism which was established in

22

the pre-Hatter of Sandoval decisions, that showing of

23

illegality had to be supported by affidavits and by a

24

non-frivolous offer of proof.

is really to require a prima facie

Therefore, with regard to whether or not the

49

1

agency

suppression motions can really be addressed in terms of

the mechanisms for review of these motions, and the

4

agency may also, in addition to its mechanism for

5

subpoenas, require the alien to file such a suppression

motion

7

will be able to respond in such a case to a

8

non-frivclous assertion of illegality on the part cf the

9

govern ment.

10

will be swamped by the filing of frivolous

prior to the hearing.

Therefore, the government

What the government is really asking for in

11

this case is that the Fourth Amendment not be enforced

12

as rigorously in this context because it would be more

13

efficient for the government to enforce immigration laws

14

without the Fourth Amendment.

15

by the government in this context are really the costs

16

imposed on the enforcement system by the Fourth

17

Amendment itself.

18

So the costs relied upon

There is a need for neutral procedures to be

19

adopted by the agency, or a need for sufficient facts

20

for the government to justify its intrusion, and that

21

cost analysis has already been conducted by the framers

22

of the Constitution in applying the Fourth Amendment to

23

government intrusions.

24

It is really unacceptable for the government

25

to say that it cannot enforce the immigration laws and

50

1

live effectively within the Fourth Amendment.

3

undocumented aliens, and it is an even worse result when

4

its primary impact is on corroding the rights of

5

Hispanic Americans.

That is a

This Court must also consider the cost tc

6
7

society posed by an abandonment of the exclusionary rule

8

in this context.

9

With regard to whether or not this case

10

requires an extension of the exclusionary rule or a

11

return to former long-standing practice, what is

12

important with regard to that consideration is whether

13

or not, first of all, the costs asserted by the

14

government are as significant as they maintain, and if

15

you look at the past history of applying the rule, and

16

the way that the suppression motions have come up in

17

this context, that cost is not going to be significant

18

in terms of the system being able to adept procedures tc

19

apply the exclusionary rule.

20

But the issue of extension is also important

21

with regard to the signal that it would send to agents

22

out in

the field who are enforcing the immigration

23

laws.

If the signal is that the Fourth Amendment is not

24

going to be taken as seriously in this context as it is

25

in the criminal context, and abandonment of the rule

51

1

will indicate to officers in the field that their

2

actions will not be reviewed with as much rigorousness,

3

and they will have additional discretion in the field.
The real danger is that officers will confuse

ethnicity with probable cause in this area.

has structured a careful balancing cf Fourth Amendment

protections and law enforcement needs in the roving

balance would be lost.
Inevitably, given the pressures under which

INS officers work, INS officers would increasingly

would be swept into an ever-growing net of suspicion and

Mr. Frey, before you commence, it

may or may net be important, but I am not clear as to

16

statement in the brief of respondents was correct that

17

the rule had been enforced consistently for many years.

necessary to reach a decision in the case, and therefore

14

the BIA had no occasion to pass upon whether it should

have been admitted or excluded.
I would not say to you that it was clear that

17

the exclusionary rule did net apply.

6

QUESTION;

Could it be they didn’t have

SR. FREY;

Well, that is an interesting point

lawyer s?

7

8

that I wanted to get to.

One of the arguments -- they

9

had lawyers in the deportation process, I think, most of

10

them, but one of the arguments that is made for why the

11

costs are not unacceptable is that most of these people

12

are poor, they won’t have lawyers, they will be deported

13

anyway, so it is all right to have the exclusionary rule

14

because we can rely cn the fact that they won’t have

15

lawyers to invoke these rights that we are giving them.
Now, this seems to be a very odd way to try to

16
17

minimize the costs of the exclusionary rule.

What it

18

really shows — it is true, most of them don't have

19

lawyers.

20

legal rights that they could assert, and it is for that

21

very reason that the exclusionary sanction is not going

22

to be an effective way of getting INS agents who are

23

otherwise acting without regard to their

24

responsibilities under the Fourth Amendment to change

25

their behavior.

Kost of them leave without asserting all the

If applying the exclusionary rule substantially advances

Now, with respect to Justice Eehnguist's

10

question about their footnote, of course there are some

11

violations that probably occur that are not — do not

12

involve the issues in the Delgado case that was decided

13

yesterday, but I think the vast bulk of claims do

14

involve that kind of claim, so that the history of

15

violations against which the Court should decide whether

16

it needs an exclusionary rule here is largely violations

17

that have turned out upon this Court's inspection of the

18

legal issue not to be violations.

19

This also alters the cost-benefit balance.

20

These

to have such a good batting average.

They were incredibly lucky in using these

The point in these cases is that it is going

7

8

to be very hard when you get into this kind of

9

nitty-gritty, what did the agent see, what did the agent

10

know, what did the alien do, was there a seizure, was it

11

supported by reasonable suspicion, at what point was the

12

admission of illegal alienage made, these are

13

exceedingly intricate questions.

14

If these 70,000 deportation hearings, which

15

now have very few — have had very few cases in which

16

that kind of question is raised, if that kind of

17

question has to be litigated in a substantial number of

18

these cases, and then on appeal to the BIA, and then,

19
