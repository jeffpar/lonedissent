CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Nr. Travis, I think you

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN C. TRAVIS, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

NR. TRAVIS;

Thank you. Your Honor.

Nr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court,

I would like to restate the question

9

presented before the Court in this case.

I believe it

10

can be restated in two parts.

11

part of the question should be, in my judgment, whether

12

routine highway traffic safety stops involve the type of

13

custodial interrogation which was a concern of the

14

Miranda court; that is, the routine, everyday, highway

15

traffic stops.

16

argument -- involves a question of whether there can be

17

a reasoned application of the judicially crafted

18

prophylactic rule of Miranda in the case of the impaired

19

driver, a person charged with the offense of driving

20

while impaired by alcohol or other chemical substances.

21

The salient facts, if I may recapitulate them

First of all, the first

Second — the second portion of cur

22

briefly, indicate that the respondent in this case was

23

observed driving on an interstate highway by a state

24

Highway Patrol trooper cn routine traffic safety

25

patrol.

He observed Nr. McCarty's car weaving back and

3

1

forth within his expected lane of travel, and followed

2

him for some two miles.
After following him for two miles, he caused

3
4

the car to be stopped, and asked Hr. McCarty to exit the

5

vehicle.

6

He was unable to stand unaided, and in his later report

7

indicated that he had to be "held up from falling."

8

attempted -- I*m sorry — at that point -- and, by the

9

way, each of these facts were entered before the

10

Muncipal Court by way of stipulation between the

11

parties, rather than an evidentiary hearing.

12

point that he realized the man could net stand on his

13

own two feet unaided. Trooper Williams concluded that he

14

would charge Er. McCarty with a traffic offense, and the

15

parties stipulated at that point his freedom to leave

16

the scene was terminated.

17

The trooper described Mr. McCarty as falling.

He

At the

Trooper Williams then attempted to have

18

Mr. McCarty perform certain field sobriety tests I think

19

the Court will recognize are traditional tests of

20

balancing, touching one's nose, walking a straight line,,

21

and so forth.

22

shews -- and that's in the Appendix at page 2 of the

23

Joint Appendix, that is -- Mr. McCarty was falling, and

24

therefore the tests could not be completed.

25

But, as the alcohol influence report form

The trooper noted that Mr. McCarty spoke with

4

1

very slurred speech — he was very hard to understand --

2

and at this point, asked Hr. McCarty if he had been

smoked

5

before."

6

Mr. McCarty, and under a state implied consent chemical

7

test statute, transported him tc a facility, which in

8

this case was the Franklin County Ohio Jail for a

9

chemical test of his blood alcohol content.

Hr.

HcCarty said he had had two beers and had

"several joints of marijuana a short time
At that point, the trooper formally arrested

At that point, Mr. McCarty took the test and

10
11

the intoxilyzer — that the Court has heard quite a bit

12

about in the last case — the intoxilyzer indicated a

13

zero blood alcohol content.

officer began to fill out what is known as the Alcchcl

19

suggestion of the Clerk, in a typewritten facsimile for

20

ease of reading.

At that point, Mr. McCarty

is a pro forma line item, fill-in-the-blanks form, if

miles and sc forth, could net stand on his feet.

5

beers and smoked several marijuana cigarettes.

6

on the back of the form, as the Court will note, the

trooper inquired of Hr. McCarty as to whether he knew

8

what day it was, what date it was, what time it was, and

the various responses are down there.

later after the implied consent test and the filling out

As to the traffic stop, the first portion of

15

what I restated as being the question before the Court,

custodial interrogation that was envisioned by the

Miranda court.

Well, I don't think the Sixth

Circuit necessarily disagreed with you on that, did they?

MB. TRAVIS:

12

The is the way I first read it,

and I will confess to the Court, to be candid with the

Court,

15

that it was important to litigate the issue before the

I wonder if this is the correct

reading, that all they held was that the statements made

custody are admissible or net?

cn A19 they also said we do not hold

10

that the mere stopping of a motor vehicle triggers

Miranda, because the police gather information on

12

misdemeanor traffic offenses, primarily through

on-the-scene questions.

form of custodial status, and the question was whether

20

this was the type of custodial status and the type of

21

22

Miranda court was concered with.

23

when I first read the opinion, I had some
However, what the Court seemed to

Throughout, the parties had stipulated a

Hhat the majority below did, in our opinion,

24

was reject a stipulation of historical fact, and thus

25

not reach the issue that the parties were litigating.

12

1

That is why we have -- and I believe it is Footnote 3 —

2

that the parties had stipulated custody as the term is

3

ordinarily considered/ but the question is whether cr

4

was concerned with.

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. TRAVIS;

No.

There was a stay. Your Honor.

There was a stay.
There was a stay when he filed

13

both in the state appellate process and then in federal

14

habeas corpus.
QUESTION :

15
16

And he entered a guilty plea, but

it was kind of a conditional plea or some kind.
MR. TRAVIS:

It was what we call a no contest

concede in the sense of the guilty plea.

So he did not

Well, if the issue is only — let's

22

just assume the issue here is only the admissibility of

the evidence made after formal custody had taken place.

24

Then what is — the only piece of evidence at issue is

25

what he signed at the bottom, on the back side of the —

13

KB. TRAVIS;

1

The repeat of the questions on

2

the back side of the Alcohol Influence Peport Form, Your

3

Honor.

Yes.
QUESTION;

4
5

And that report was admitted into

eviden ce ?
NR. TRAVIS;

6

Yes.

As a matter of fact, it was

7

a joint exhibit, part of the stipulation.

8

the parties did not have an evidentiary hearing.

Joint

10

As I said,
It was

Exhibit 1 in the Franklin County Muncipal Court,

the Traffic Court.
QUESTION;

11

But the defendant had made other

12

statements before formal ajrrest, and those, presumably

13

under the Sixth Circuit opinion, would be admissible.
MR. TRAVIS;

14

As Judge Wellford -- well, as the

15

majority -- if I am incorrect in my concern about the

16

panel decision and that the panel decision actually

17

ruled that the statements made on the scene of the

18

traffic stop were admissible, I would agree.
Secondly, Judge Wellford stated that he would

19

20

hold, even if there were a full-blown custody at that

21

scene,

22

stop,

23

statements which the majority found objectionable, as

24

not having been given following Miranda advice, should

25

be considered harmless error because they were

that any situation involving a routine traffic
he would admit those.

He also indicated that the

14

1

repetitious — essentially repetitious — excuse me.

2

QUESTION;

3

NR. TRAVIS;

4

Are you arguing harmless error here?
We have included that, althcught

that is not the prime thrust of our argument, Your Hcnor.

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. TRAVIS;

Did you raise it below?
It was litigated in the sense --

7

not litigated, not raised by the party, the state -- but

8

was decided, in my judgment, by the dissent specifically

9

addressing it and implicit in the majority, the majority

10

rejecting it.

Therefore, I would say that it had been

11

ruled upon and thus preserved.

12

The primary thrust of the second portion of

13

our question presented to the Court this morning -- I

14

will restate it just briefly here -- is whether there

15

can be a reasoned application, a rational application of

16

the judicially crafted prophylactic rule of Miranda in

17

the case of an individual arrested for impaired driving.

18

And I would stress the term "impaired

19

driving."

20

driving, but drunken and drug driving.

21

instance, we suggest that there are unique reasons why

22

the prohophylactic rule was not applicable in this case,

23

in this type of case.

24
25

We are talking not simply about drunken

The simplest

In this

way I can present this position,

I believe, is to ask the Court to compare -- or I will

15

1

compare, rather — what would happen in any other

2

instance where a detective, in the traditional sense of

3

an investigation of a criminal act, had a person in

4

custody — we are talking new about custodial

5

interrogation — and he wishes to interrogate that

6

person?

7

detective will do is make a determination, factually, of

8

the ability, the cognitive ability of this individual

9

whom he wishes to question, the cognitive ability to be

One of the first things any conscientious

10

aware of his so-called Miranda advice, Miranda warnings,

11

to have the cognitive ability to appreciate them, to

12

fully understand them, and then, of course, under

13

Johnson against Zerbst, for the later court hearing,

14

whether there would be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary

15

waiver of those rights.
The difficulty with the impaired driver and

16
17

the uniqueness of this offense is that the very

18

preliminary questions that any conscientious detective

19

would ask are precluded if Miranda is applicable.

20

conscientious detective would inquire of the

21

individual’s age, educational background,

22

to read and write, and almost universally, I submit,

23

whether the person had been drinking,

24

had taken any drugs; if they’ve been drinking, when, how

25

much,

and so forth.

16

The

whether the person

QUESTION;

2

you're talking about?

3

MR. TRAVIS;

But this is before custodial arrest

No.

I’m suggesting that if he

4

wishes to interview the person, under the traditional

5

situation of custodial interrogation -- I'm talking

6

about a detective who wishes to interview an arrested

7

person who is being held in the police station, who —

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. TRAVIS:

You’re still on your hypothetical.
Yes.

I'm speaking in the

10

hypothetical sense that is a comparison to this case,

11

that any such detective would, of necessity, if he's

12

conscientious, make a determination of whether the

13

person had the ability to appreciate, understand, and

14

knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his

15

Miranda rights.

16

That would include the very questions which

17

Miranda would preclude in this case, in the case -- the

18

unique case — of the impaired driver; that is, have you

19

been drinking?

20

any medication?

21

cognitively understand and appreciate his rights.

22
23
24
25

Hae you taken any drugs?

Have you taken

The attempt to learn whether he can

That anomalous result, I think, counsels
against extension of Miranda in this unique situation.
QUESTION:

But if your logic is correct, your

hypothetical detective could go into the cell block,

17

1

determine that the guy was drunk and therefore not

2

capable of waiving his Miranda rights, and say well, why

3

give them at all; since he can’t appreciate them, it

4

would just be counterproductive.

5

MR. TRAVIS:

Are we talking about the

6

hypothetical of some other offense, not the drunk

7

driving or impaired driving?
QUESTION:

8
9
10

Nc.

But I mean, presumably, a

person could get drunk in their cell block, even though
they weren’t charged with drunken driving.

11

MR. TRAVIS:

That's true.

But my point. Your

12

Honor,

13

or cannot be given.

14

hypothetical is that a conscientious detective would go

15

into those questions, but in the case of the impaired

16

driver, application of Miranda would preclude those

17

preliminary questions.

18

question, have you been drinking or taking drugs, to

19

determine whether the man understood his rights, because

20

they go immediately to the heart of the offense.

21

I'm saying that at this point — my

He could not ask the preliminary

But if he hasn’t taken — if he

22

hasn’t made a custodial arrest, I don’t see that the

23

Sixth Circuit would prevent you from asking those

24

questions.

25

MR. TRAVIS:

If he did this, if he filled all

this information out at the scene.

2

the things that the state law does, and does — I would

3

assume, frankly, that it does so in virtually any state

proof positive, in a breathalzyer.

And they have dual evidence.

They

have the on-the-scene questioning which apparently the

Sixth Circuit doesn't find fault with either.

MR. TRAVIS*

Well, I would agree with you,

2

Justice O’Connor, but I would still have to say that --

3

and this may be begging the question, begging

4

Your Honor's question -- but it would still seem to me

5

that before there can be a rational application of the

6

prophylactic rule of Miranda in this case, there must be

7

some way that the officer can rationally determine these

8

things, if there is going to be any questioning at all.

9

And, as we --

MR. TRAVIS*

Isn’t that right?

I can’t tell you that in the

8

Well, I don’t see what value

Well, the simple rule is, normally

9

you take somebody to the station, ask him questions, you

start out giving the Miranda warnings, and we don't have

11

to litigate these questions.
ME. TEAVIS:

12

I would agree, Justice Stevens,

13

in general.

14

to present in the second portion of our argument here —

15

is that in the case of a person impaired by either

16

alcohol or chemicals, and specifically this fact

18

bit farther along in the report form.

20

of care.

21

directly identically, words of booking, attendant to

22

arrest, and so forth, this may very well be more in that

23

line than it is in the line of interrogation.

24
25

My concern is — and what we have attempted

When a person is

It would seem to me that, although not

4

extent that other than he made some statement on the

5

scene — when he tests zero on the breathalyzer, there

is an indication that there is something wrong with the

7

man, but there is an indication it is not

be a combination of the snyergistic effect of several

12

Perhaps he was on a miner tranquilizer.
I'm suggesting that these line item pro forma

13

inquiries are more in that nature, and not in the#nature

14

of the traditional interrogation, and that if the person

15

is in that state, it is at test difficult to make any

16

determination that they had a knowing, intelligent,

17

awareness of their rights, even if they were given.

18

QUESTIONS

Why isn't the practical, sensible

19

thing to do, to give the Miranda warning at the outset

20

to a custodial situation, and then let the defendant

later say he didn't understand it.

But what we have suggested to the Court,

10

and what I think that would do would be to throw the

11

situation, if you will, back into the voluntariness

12

question on the statement itself; that in almost any

13

instance, certainly in Mr. McCarty's instance, there is

14

question of whether or not he would have a voluntary

15

statement in the traditional sense.

16
17
18

I think that's essentially what we're arguing
before the Court this morning.
QUESTION;

Well, cf course, you certainly are

19

interested in having it made clear here, if you possibly

20

can have it mad clear, that on-the-spot precustody

21

questioning doesn't require Miranda warnings.

22

MR. TRAVIS;

23

QUESTION;

24
25

I would expect that there will be

argument on the other side that it does.
MR. TRAVIS;

I'm certain there is, and —

MR. TRAVIS:

That portion of the quote from

Mirand a does indicate that.

And yet,

as respondent

10

points out, there is additional language in there that

11

is not totally clear as to whether it relates directly

12

to the person who is the suspect in the case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. WILLIAM MEEKS

MR. MEEKS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it

20

please

21

puttin g this case in a proper factual setting as it

22

p e r ta i ns to the Alcohol Influence Report Form that the

23

Court has had the opportunity to review.
The Sixth Circuit's ruling basically does two

things .

It precludes the use of statements made by

MR. MEEKS;

21

MR. MEEKS:

22

And you can get that from a reading

Yes, I do.
And you agree with that?
No, I don * t.
I didn't think you -I agree in part; then I disagree

in part.
Our position is very simply this;

23

that the

24

Sixth

Circuit's decision, as it pertains to the

25

inadmissibility of the statements made during custodial

26

1

interr cgaticn, sho uld be affirmed.

Cur problem with the

2

Sixth Circuit’s de cision is simply that their language

3

would preclude any types of statements made at the scene,

4

Now, my concern, Your Honor, is that --

By preclude, you mean they would

allow the admissio n into evidence of those statements

With all due respect. Your Honor,

we do not contest the judgment of the Sixth Circuit,

It may be.

It may be.

But

you about on-the-scene questioning, the trial would be

considerably different than it would be under the Sixth

Circuit's opinion, as you read it even.

MR. MEEKS:

5

There would be

That part of the decision,

6

however, Your Honor, only pertained to the in-custody

7

statements.

8

cross-petitioning because of the fact that that ruling

9

was not part of the actual judgment.

10

QUESTION:

Well, it would certainly vary the

consequence of the judgment considerably.
MR. MEEKS:

It was our

understanding —

12

We do not feel the necessity of

Yes, but it wasn't part of the

QUESTION:

15

The Court of Appeals did — the

16

majority of the Court of Appeals did say the writ of

17

habeas corpus should issue and there had to be a

18

retrial, didn't it?

19

MR. MEEKS:

20

That's correct.
And you're simply saying that, for

21

a somewhat different reason, the same judgment should be

22

entere d.

23
24
25

MR. MEEKS:

The same judgment as it pertains

to the in-custody statements should be affirmed.
QUESTION:

Well, the judgment is that there be

28

a new trial

2

MR. MEEKS;

3

QUESTION:

Correct.
And you’re saying, for somewhat

4

different reasons than the Court of Appeals said, there

should be also be -- the same judgment should be entered

6

as was entered by the Court of Appeals.

7

MR. MEEKS:

8

QUESTION;

9
10

Yes, sir.
But it would certainly have a

different consequence cn the trial, on what would happen
at the retrial.

11

MR. MEEKS:

12

QUESTION:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.
Well, I would think that when the

13

officer — under the Sixth Circuit opinion, when the

14

officer wanted to testify about the on-the-scene

15

questioning, it would be admissible.

16

MR. MEEKS;

17

QUESTION:

18
19

The crucial thing -And under your view, it would not

be admissible.
MR. MEEKS:

That's correct.

Eut yet again,

20

the point that we are making is it was not part of the

21

judgment of the Sixth Circuit.

22

feel it necessary to cross-petition.

23

Therefore, we did net

In any event, back tc my point that I was

24

making concerning the Alcohol Influence Report Form,

25

since it was the crucial part of this case — that

29

1

report was prepared during custodial interrogation.

2

be no mistake about the Alcohol Influence Report Form.

3

That is a document that is designed by law enforcement

4

officers to elicit information that will be used to

5

prosecute the suspect at trial.

6

to explain it.

7

years,

There is no other way

That's been the way it is in Ohio for

and it will continue to be that way.
If the Court has had the opportunity to review

8
9

And

the second page of that document, it is clear that what

10

the officer is attempting to do while engaging in the

11

custodial interrogation is to find out where that person

12

was, how long he had been there, how much he had to

13

drink.

21

QUESTION;

Mr. Meeks, I think the Court of

22

Appeals didn't really adopt your stipulation.

23

that's what I understand your opponent contends.

rejected that.
NR. MEEKS:

That's correct.

They felt that

they were not bound to follow that stipulation.

7

wouldn't say they rejected the stipulation, only that

8

they did not feel hound by it.

9

QUESTION:

I

Well, if you read their opinion, it

10

seems to me logically that they did reject it, because

11

if they had accepted it, they would have said -- moved

12

the point at which evidence should be excluded back

13

further in time.

14

MR. MEEKS:

Perhaps so. Your Honor, but

15

nevertheless, they found, without any hesitation, tc my

16

mind anyway, that at the time the Alcohol Influence

17

Report Form was filled out, he was in custody.

MR. MEEKS:

QUESTION:

21

MR. MEEKS:

is a fairly cut and dried situation; that

And no one disputes that.
At the jail.
That's the very end.
That's correct.

That's correct.

Miranda should

There is no legitimate reason for Miranda

32

not to be applied to a custody situation.

2

petitioner has advanced a lot of different reasons,

3

indicating that Miranda was not designed to attach to

4

custodial interrogation involving traffic matters; yet,

5

there is no real distinction as to why it shouldn't.

6

The

The petitioner takes the position that well,

7

this is a traffic misdemeanor; it’s not a felony.

The

8

point is, is that if we're going to be drawing

9

distinctions between felonies and misdemeanors, some

10

states have felonies, where other states have

11

misdemeanors for identical conduct.

12

use a breakdown on the basis of felony-misdemeanor line,

13

it would be totally unworkable.

14

If we're going to

Miranda itself focused on the nature of the

15

interrogation, not upon the nature of the offense.

16

even though Miranda itself and the cases that were

17

collected at the same time were certainly felony cases,

18

there has been no language in any of those decisions

19

designed to limit custodial interrogation to felony

20

cases exclusively.

21

QUESTION;

And

New you said Miranda emphasized or

22

focused on the kind of interrogation.

Did it not focus

23

very largely on the place of the interrogation?

11

However, in cases subsequent to that.

MR. MEEKS:

It was custody, no question about

And the Court so found.

12

However, the point is, is that when Mr. Carty

13

went to the Franklin County Jail, there was no serious

14

question about the fact that Mr. McCarty was just as

15

much in custody as Mr. Miranda was or Mr. Westover was,

16

or any of the other situations this Court addressed many

17

years ago.

18

Mere to the second part of our argument in

19

this case, we have suggested that the Sixth Circuit's

20

language limiting the inadmissibility to the custodial

21

statements made at the scene would be too limiting.

have made the suggestion and we have urged this Court

You're just concerne d with trying

to get the Court to adopt seme other rule to require an

office r to make an arrest at a certain ti me, based on

23

what h e knows, but I don’t think that que sticn is before

24

us .

25

QUESTION:

Hell, we’ve rejected it countless

38

1

times,

the idea that if an officer has probable cause to

2

arrest a person, the person will be deemed arrested,

3

even though the officer doesn't make the arrest till

4

later.

5

Cou rt.

But that simply has not been adopted by this

HR. MEEKSi

6

Your Honor, what we are suggesting

7

is that we are in a position where, if a suspect is in

8

the situation of either being in formal custody or its

9

functional equivalent, and combined with that the

10

arresting officer has probable cause to believe that

11

that crime has been committed, at that point in time, if

12

he wishes tc interrogate — only if he wishes to

13

interrogate — then Hiranda warnings should be given.

14

Those three criteria must be met.
QUESTION*

15

Yes, but Mr. Meeks, in this very

16

case, as I understand the sequence of events, the

17

questioning on the scene took place before the officer

18

decided to take him back to the station.
ME. MEEKS*

19

fls far as the stipulation in this

20

case is concerned. Your Honor, the officer — once he

21

stopped the vehicle after he made the observations --

22

was satisfied that that man was going to jail.
QUESTION:

23

Eut he didn't tell him, let’s go to

24

the station until after he had these initial questions,

25

did he?

39

1

MR. MEEKS;

He did not articulate that, no.

2

But his freedom to leave the scene was terminated once

3

his car was stopped and once the officer approached the

4

vehicle and was able, then, to pursue his probable cause

5

findings, beyond simply reckless driving, into potential

6

drunk driving charge.

7

Your Honor, that at that point we have the functional

8

equivalent of being in custody.

9

QUESTION;

And it's our position, frankly,

Under ycur submission, it doesn't

10

make any difference when the officer says, in substance,

11

okay,

let's go to the station?

12

MR. MEEKS;

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. MEEKS;

No, sir.
That doesn’t enter into it.
No, sir.

The actual language

15

isn't important, because what we’re suggesting is an

16

objective test.

17

any other test that this Court has alredy repudiated for

18

determining custody.

19

objective standard -- when a reasonable person would

20

feel that they are no longer free to leave the scene.

We are not here seeking a focus test or

Rather, we are looking at an

22

QUESTION;

Well, under that test, every time

23

you’re stopped — as scon as you’re stopped, your test

24

triggers in, then.

25

MR. MEEKS;

In most situations,

40

I agree with

1

you.

But that doesn’t mean interrogation can follow.

2

QUESTION:

How about this hypothetical?

3

QUESTION:

You would say it cannot follow.

4

MR. MEEKS:

5

QUESTION:

The only time that interrogation -Under your test,

when the man is

6

not free to leave is the triggering of the duty to

impose — to give Miranda warning.

That’s your submission, as I

understand it.
MR. MEEKS:

the type of interrogation contemplated by Rhode Island

MR. MEEKS:

We don't contest that.

MR. MEEKS:

Oh, no, sir.
You didn’t mean that?
Oh, no.

If I misspoke, I

11

apologize.

12

of all

13

there will be an easily understandable rule, because if

14

we don’t have something like this, then what we’re going

15

to do is, in DWI cases, for instance, the officers will

16

just merely get the people at the scene, interrogate

17

them at the window, and just simply take the station

18

house interrogation would be precluded, and move that t

19

the car.

20

That’s not what I intended.

But the purpose

this, frankly, is to provide a situation where

And what we are suggesting is, is that kind of

21

situation that the officers would then engage in would

22

be nothing more than a way of circumventing Miranda.

23

And when an officer does that, they are still dealing

24

with a person who clearly is in custody within an

25

objective standard that any driver of a motor vehicle

would feel, had they been stopped on a freeway.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN C. TRAVIS, ESQ.

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

14

MR. TRAVIS:

On the Sixth Circuit panel

15

opinion, I would simply invite the Court's attention to

16

the fact that the Court did order, that is, the Sixth

17

Circuit did order the writ and a retrial.

18

submit to the Court that on retrial, without some

19

clarification here, we would net know what to tell the

20

state trial court was admissible or not admissible.

And I would

As to the felony-misdemeanor line, I think the

21
22

Court will note that we have never pressed that.

We

23

have never pressed that in any of the — in the petition

24

or the brief, other than the general question of whether

25

or not

the Miranda doctrine should be applied in the

46

1

case of misdemeanor traffic offenses

We've never

2

suggested that it's simply not applicable because it is,

3

in fact, a misdemeanor.

4

And, last, although we, of course, differ on

5

it, we would urge that if the Court does disagree with

6

the second portion of cur argument, that it was

7

effectively ruled upon by the Sixth Circuit and that the

8

doctrine of harmless error should be applicable.

9

Mr. McCarty’s condition prior to the so-called

10

Alcohol Influence Report Form as such, and if his

11

handwriting is impaired, which is non testimonial, I

12

would submit would make any error in this case harmless

13

beyond any reasonable doubt.
