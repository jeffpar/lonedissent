ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK I. LEVY, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

MR. LEVY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

8
9

Mr. Levy, you may proceed

This case is here on direct appeal to the United
States District Court for the Northern District of

10

Alabama.

11

section in the Social Security Amendments of 1977 and in

12

particular the exception and severability provisions in

13

the offset section.

14

It involves the government pension offset

The District Court, after certifying a

15

nationwide class action, invalidated both the exception

16

and the severability provisions.

17

the District Court extended spousal benefits or expanded

18

the exception to Appellee and the nationwide class of

19

non-dependent men he represents, and as a result, it

20

entitled those non-dependent men to the receipt of both

21

government pension and Social Security spousal benefits.

Based on those rulings,

22

The Social Security provides spousal benefits —

QUESTION:

Was that judgment stayed?

24

MR. LEVY:

The judgment was stayed pending

25

appeal to this Court and it remains stayed.

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

MR. LEVY:

The Social Security Act provides

3

spousal benefits based on the earnings record of the

4

applicant's spouse.

5

benefits were enacted in 1939, the provisions for

6

husbands' and widowers' benefits in 1950.

7

The provisions for wives' and widows'

From the time spousal benefits were first

8

established, the Act has contained a Social Security

9

offset provision.

That provision requires that were an

10

applicant is entitled to more than one benefit under the

11

Social Security Act, those benefits will be offset against

12

each other so that -in net effect the recipient or the

13

applicant will receive only the higher of the two

14

benefits.

15

For example, if an applicant is entitled to

16

spousal benefits and also to retirement benefits based on

17

his own work account, the spousal benefits will be reduced

18

by the amount of the direct benefit to which the applicant

19

is entitled.

20

Until the statute at issue in this case, the Act

21

contained no comparable provision for people, primarily

22

government employees, who worked in employment that was

23

not covered by the Social Security system.

24
25

In March 1977, this Court decided the Goldfarb
case and invalidated the gender-based eligibility standard

in the Social Security Act that required men, but not

2

women, to prove dependency in order to be eligible for

3

spousal benefits.

4
5

As a result of Goldfarb, spousal benefits,
therefore, were extended to non-dependent men.

6

In practice, this did not —

7

QUESTION:

Who extended it?

8

MR. LEVY:

I don't believe that the issue of

9
10

extension versus nullification was ever directly litigated
in this Court.

11

QUESTION:

Who extended it, the Secretary or —

12

MR. LEVY:

Believing that that to be the result

13

that follows from the decision of this Court, the benefits

14

were extended.

15

That, in practice, did not prove to be a problem

for the Social Security Trust Fund with respect to

non-dependent men who worked in employment covered by

offset provision at issue here applies to spousal benefits

6

that are payable based on valid applications filed on or

7

after December 1, 1977, which was the effective date of

the new offset provision for government pensions.

9

Now, the government pension offset provision was

10

a reasonable and a permissible solution to the financial

11

problems confronting the Social Security Trust Fund

12

following Goldfarb.

13

Congress became concerned about a different problem.

14

Congress became concerned that the elimination or

reduction of dual benefits that would be caused by

16

applying the new government offset provision to people who

17

had planned — Well, to people who had retired or were

18

close to retirement and who had planned a retirement in

19

accordance with pre-Goldfarb law that allowed for

20

unreduced spousal payments.

21

application of the offset to these people would have

22

imposed a hardship on them and been unfair to them.

23

But, in enacting this provision,

Congress felt that the

QUESTION:

Was he dependent or what?

6

MR. LEVY:

He was not dependent.

Because he

7

filed his application after the effective date of the

8

offset provision, he was subject to the offset and

9

because, and it is undispute, he was not dependent on his

10

wife, he was not within the protection of the exception

11

clause.

12

and because the amount of his government pension exceeded

13

the amount of his spousal benefits the offset required

14

that there were no net spousal benefits payable to him.

Therefore, in the end, the offset applied to him,

15

After Appellee exhausted his administrative

remedies, he brought this action under Section 405(g) of

clause.

The District Court struck down

The Court found that the exception provision

21

incorporated the gender-based dependency test that existed

22

in the Social Security Act in Janury 1977 prior to this

I don't propose to discuss it unless the Court has

8

specific questions about it.

9

Appellee has raised an issue of statutory

But, there are two important constitutional

10

issues.

11

struck down the exception clause because it incorporated

12

the gender-based dependency standard.

13

The first, as I say, is that the District Court

In addition, the Court also struck down the

14

severability clause because the severability clause

15

required that the offset remain in effect without

16

qualification, and, therefore, a plaintiff who

17

successfully challenged the exception clause would not

18

receive any monetary relief in the form of unreduced

19

spousal benefits.

20

Let me turn first to the issue of the exception

21

clause.

22

incorporate the gender-based dependency test that existed

prior to Goldfarb.

important governmental objective and if it is

objective.

5

We think that the exception clause in this

MR. LEVY:

11

Well, that is correct, and it

actually is somewhat more complicated than that.

Before I

get into the details, let me say that in the end it does

include a gender differentiation.

But, to follow up on your observation, Justice

Stevens, there are both men and women who are eligible

are protected.

as a result of Goldfarb, who filed a valid application for

benefits prior to December 1977, are also protected.

Similarly, because of the effective date

In

Both of those classes

On the other side of the line, there is one

12

group of women who are not eligible for benefits under

pre-Goldfarb law but are now eligible for such benefits.

That is the group of divorced wives and surviving divorced

years.

19

therefore, are subject to the offset.

20

Because they were not eligible under pre-Goldfarb

In addition, non-dependent men after Goldfarb

1

line of the offset and the distinguishing characteristic

2

between them is the reliance interests of the category in

3

which they fall.

4

The protection of reliance interests as those

5

lines suggest was the very purpose that Congress had in

6

mind in enacting the exception provision.

8

retirees who had planned their retirements in accordance

11

books since 1939.
The legislative record makes clear that this is

mind in enacting the exception.
There was no sexist animus or motivation on the

part of Congress here.

19

proposition is sound and self-evident on its face,

20

especially given the nature of the Social Security system

21

and the nature of the retirement planning process.

22

We think that

I also think that this Court's decisions in a

23

wide range of areas have recognized reliance interests of

24

much the same sort.

25

It was not improper for Congress to be concerned
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

about the hardship and distruption that would have been

2

caused if the new offset provision were applied to people

3

who were retired or close to retirement and who had

4

planned their retirement in accordance with pre-Goldfarb

5

law.
In addition to that purpose being important and

6
7

legitimate, we also submit that the exception clause is

8

substantially related to the achievement of that purpose

9

and it rests on a reasoned analysis of the statutory

10

classification.

11

Indeed, by incorporating the pre-Goldfarb law in

12

the exception provision, the exception is precisely suited

13

to the protection of that reliance interest.
In addition, as Justice O'Connor pointed out,

14
15

the exception is limited to a transitional five-year

16

period which Congress determined was a reasonable time to

17

protect people against the disruption of their retirement

18

plans.

19

We also would point out that when the exception

20

clause expired by its own terms in December of 1982, and,

21

thus, the pre-Goldfarb reliance interests had then been

22

satisfied, Congress twice reconsidered the offset

23

provision and on both occasions it enacted an

24

gender-neutral provision.

25

evident in the initial Act, that Congress limited the

We think that confirms what was

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

gender-based classification to what was necessary to

2

protect the pre-Goldfarb reliance interest.

3

Finally, in enacting the exception and offset in

4

1977, Congress considered other alternatives, but it

5

rejected them as less desirable.

6

makes it clear that Congress adopted the offset and

7

exception provisions as a deliberate policy choice in

8

preference to other approaches they might have taken.

9

The legislative record

Now, Appellee seeks to upset Congress' policy

10

choice and makes two arguments that the exception is

11

unconstitutional.

12

First, he argues that the protection of the

13

pre-Goldfarb reliance interest was not a legitimate and

14

important governmental objective.

15

As Congress recognized though, and we think it

16

quite plain, we don't — The reliance interests of people

17

under the prior law, in accorance with the provisions

18

passed by Congress and in effect since 1939, cannot be so

19

easily dismissed.

20

way by the fact that this Court in Goldfarb ultimately

21

held the statute to violate equal protection.

22

Such reliance is not discredited in any

As in cases such as Lemon versus Kurtzman and

23

the Manhart and the Norris decisions, reliance on a prior

24

state of the law, even if that law turned out eventually

25

to be improper or unconstitutional, does not make that
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

reliance illegitimate and does not detract from the

2

importance of protecting the reliance interests that arose

3

under prior law.

4

Appellee also makes a second argument that the

5

statutory classification here is underinclusive because it

6

doesn't protect the asserted reliance interests of

7

non-dependent men who claim to have relied on Goldfarb

8

between the time it was announced in March of 1977, and

9

the enactment of the offset provisions in December 1977,

10

and who did not file a valid application for spousal

11

benefits prior to the effective date of the offset,

12

December 1, 1977.

13

We don't think that Congress was required,

14

however, to recognize this short-lived and new-found

15

reliance interests of men that was based on the extension

16

of benefits following Goldfarb.

17

Congress could conclude, in the context of the

18

pressing need for the offset itself — and it is important

19

to remember that the offset is the principal provision

20

here to which the exception is a specific exemption — in

21

that context Congress could concluded that the reliance

22

interest advanced by Appellee was less substantial and

23

less deserving of protection than the long-standing

24

reliance interest under the statute passed by Congress

25

prior to Goldfarb.
17

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

As Justice Stevens and I discussed before, there

1

2

are men and women on both sides of the line.
The interest that Appellee asserts was based on

3
4

the Goldfarb decision.

Let me come at it this way.

That

5

was a very recent decision at the time and Congress could

6

reasonably have concluded that it was unlikely to have

7

lead to widespread and significant reliance.

8

In addition, it was possible, as in fact turned

9

out to be the case, that Congress would pass a statute in

10

response to the Goldfarb decision and that statute would

11

affect the newly recognized claims of non-dependent men

12

such as Appellee.

13

to the reliance interests of the pre-Goldfarb retirees.

14

And, for that reason, we think the statute is perfectly

15

constitutional to distinguish between those groups and

16

does not raise any constitutional difficulties because it

17

is limited to the interest that Congress found to be more

18

substantial and more worthy of protection.

Neither of those considerations applies

I should go on to say that even if Congress was

19

20

required to accommodate the interest in some way that

21

Appellee asserts, its failure to do so does not establish

22

that the exception clause as it exists is not

23

substantially related to the protection of reliance

24

interests.

25

enactment of the offset provision.

6

The only group that Appellee raises is this

Even though that limited group was not taken

7

into account, we think it is clear that there still is a

8

substantial fit between the exception clause and the

9

protection of reliance interests.

10

And, in assessing the substantiality of the fit,

11

it is important again to note that even if Appellees

12

reliance interest had to be included at all, they are

13

still less substantial than the groups that are now

14

protected under the statute, less substantial than the

15

long-standing reliance interest under pre-Goldfarb law

16

and they are less substantial than the interest of

17

non-dependent men who submitted a valid application and

18

were receiving or were entitled to receive spousal

19

benefits between March and December of 1977.

20

Appellee's standard is also one based on a

21

subjective reliance interest.

22

statute would constitute a marked departure from the

23

easily determined objective criteria now in the exception

24

and the offset provisions and would be extremely difficult

25

and burdensome for the government to administer in

For all of these reasons, we think the exception

clause itself is constitutional.
In the event the Court disagrees with that

submission, however, it must then address the

6

constitutionality of the severability clause, which, as I

7

mentioned before, provides that if the exception is

invalid in any respect, the offset will remain in effect

without qualification and the exception to the offset will

be eliminated in its entirety rather than extended to

end, that the balance struck by Congress in the exception

was impermissible.
QUESTION:

4
5

Of course, it did go further than the

usual severability clause, didn't it?
MR. LEVY:

6

Well, this is a severability clause

7

in the usual sense in two ways.

First, it provides that

8

the offset will be severed in its entirety and remain in

9

effect.

It also discusses the severability of the

10

exception provision and provides that any remaining valid

11

portions of the exception will not be severed.

12

severability clause does not always have to be in favor of

13

severability we don't believe.

14

as Congress found here, be in favor of non-severability.

The

It can just as well, and

It was a perfectly reasonable goal for Congress

15
16

to try to protect the Social Security Trust Fund from

17

great liability if it turned out that it could not limit

18

the exception to the group of people that it considered to

19

be most worthy of special consideration.
Now, severability is a question of legislative

20
21

intent.

22

statute it would have enacted, what it would have done, if

23

it had known at the outset that the statute as drafted was

24

unconstitutional.

the scope of the statute it was enacting and we think it

2

acted well within its legislative powers in so doing.
In addition, the severability clause is also

supported by the decisions of this Court indicating that

an underinclusive statute can be remedied either by

extension or by nullification of its benefits.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

3

ORAL STATEMENT OF JOHN R. BENN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

4

MR. BENN:

5

6

Mr. Benn?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Before I address Mr. Mathews' arguments on the

7

8

issues in this case, I would like to preface my remarks

9

with a characterization that has been made on the

10

exception clause.

11

characterized by the Solicitor as being a transitional

12

device.

13

everyone who qualifies.

14

those non-dependent females, and those dependent men who

15

get into this window that is created by the exception

16

clause will remain within that window or within that class

17

throughout their lifetime.

beginning in 1983, this year, will entitle Mr. Mathews to

19

benefits.

20

The exception clause has been

It is not that.

It is a lifetime exemption for
Those individuals, those females,

So, this is not a device that

Please, that characterization is going to be

21

important when you compare the Social Security

22

contributions of the spouses and see the inequality that

23

is achieved under the statute as designed.

24

The fundamental question before this Court is if

25

the exception clause is interpreted in one fashion whether
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

or not there has been a perpetuation of the

2

unconstitutional sex discrimination that occurred in

3

Goldfarb.
The statute is important, both to classes of

4

5

men, as indicated by Mr. Robert Mathews, but perhaps more

6

importantly from a constitutional standpoint from that of

7

Mary Mathews, because it depreciates her Social Security

8

contributions while at the same time provides less

9

financial resources for her family unit than what is

10

provided to a similarly situated male applicant.

11

important as far as the focus of this particular case.

That is

The fundamental question is divided into three

12
13

areas.

First of all, a statutory interpretation issue,

14

whether or not the exception clause incorporates a

15

gender-based dependency test.
The second issue is whether or not there has

16
17

been a denial of equal protection to Mary Mathews; and,

18

third, whether this Court should extend or nullify the

19

exception clause as stated in the legislation.
Directing my attention first of all to the

20
21

statutory argument, in essence, it is Mr. Mathews'

22

position that there is a statutory basis for affirmance in

23

this case.

24
25

The Solicitor asked the Court in brief to focus
on two items.

First of all, the language of the statute,
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

which he said is clear and unambiguous and, second of all,

2

its legislative history.

3

Focusing on the first of those, the language of

4

the statute itself, if the Court will review Section

5

334(g), there is nothing in that statute indicating that

6

dependency is required.

7

dependency.

8
9

It does not per se require

Now, please keep in mind the framework under
which that clause was passed.

That clause was passed

10

after Congress had known how the Court was going to

11

interpret Section 402(c) of the Social Security Act.

12

essence, reading out gender-based dependency as being a

13

requirement for spousal benefits.

14

Now, on the other hand —

QUESTION:

In

Did you make this argument, Mr. Benn,

MR. BENN:

4

That is correct, Your Honor.

We do

5

feel though that it is basis on which the case can be

6

affirmed based upon the statutory construction.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Benn, that interpretation though

8

of this statute is just flatly inconsistent with the

9

congressional intent and under those circumstances this

10

Court doesn't apply that canon of construction that you

11

are suggesting.
MR. BENN:

12

Your Honor, I think it would be a

13

fair characterization to make that there has been an

14

unfair mixture made in the presentation before this Court

15

of the legislative history.

the history of the pension offset provision.

that provision is not an issue.

The legislative documents that were produced

after passage, the committee reports and the summaries,

They refer repeatedly, and Footnote 12 of our brief

6

highlights this, to terminology that is non-gender

case without ever reaching the constitutional issue.

16

QUESTION:

And, although

Mr. Benn, is there really much left

to the offset clause if you win on this argument?
MR. BENN:

No, Your Honor.

If you recall, Mr.

17

Levy indicated to you at least four classes of

18

beneficiaries that would still be affected by the pension

19

offset provision.

20

affected by the offset provision by this interpretation is

21

going to be Mr. Mathews or the class represented by Mr.

22

Mathews for spousal benefits.

23
24
25

The only class that would not be

That is husbands.

But, there are, indeed, four classes that still
will be affected by the pension offset provision.
QUESTION:

just simply the husbands concerned.

5

entitlement and we do have three classes —

group they wanted the offset to apply to was husbands who

That is where most of the money is

11

in the case.

MR. BENN:

And, you would reverse the

14

congressional decision as that major group covered by the

15

offset provision.

16

MR. BENN:

Your Honor, I think —

17

QUESTION:

Isn't that right?

18

MR. BENN:

Yes, Your Honor, that is the approach

19

we are taking.

However, that would still be an unfair

characterization of the legislative intent.

Now, on the other hand, if we interpret — go

2

beyond the text of the statute, and we go to the

3

legislative history — I have discussed the legislative

5

two remarks made on the floor of Congress.

the language of the statute itself uses terminology as it

affects and being administered in January of 1977.

8

Peculiarly, there is not anything in the

legislative history indicating why the date of January

10

1977 was selected.

11

date has particular importance as opposed to December 1976

12

or February 1977, and until that keystone of construction

13

is reached, there is not necessarily the meaning asked by

14

the Solictor to be given to the statute.

15

There is nothing indicating that that

As being administered, that particular portion

16

of the phrase of the statute is also important because the

Secretary at that particular time in January of 1977 was

18

not administering the statute to preclude benefits because

of dependency.

21

in abeyance until the Court made its decision in Goldfarb.

full force and effect.

Those benefits were paid.

The second issue in this case deals with an

1

2

equal protection issue and applies to the case of Mary

3

Mathews.
The Solicitor has stated that the standards be

4
5

applied by this Court, and one which we accept, is that

6

the exception clause must serve an important governmental

7

interest and at the same time the means selected by

8

Congress must be substantially related to the achievement

9

of that important governmental objective.
Now, a remark that the Solicitor does not make

10

11

that is, however, important that when you attempt to

12

analyze the situation, is who must bear the burden of

13

proving that particular standard.
The Court has indicated that the burden of

14
15

proving that the discrimination, if it is there, serves an

16

important governmental purpose and is substantially

17

related, rests upon the Secretary in this instance.

not a burden that Mr. Mathews has to bear.

2

been an equal protection violation most probably there

3

will be a class of people who relied upon that statute.
Stated otherwise, there cannot be reliance upon

an unconstitutional statute, and that is in essence

8

what —

QUESTION:

There are a lot of cases against you

on that point.

the doctrine of Chevron Oil. There are lots of people who

10

do rely on unconstitutional statute, and this Court in

11

different cases has upheld that reliance.

12

MR. BENN:

Yes, Justice Rehnquist, however —

13

QUESTION:

So why do you say there cannot be

14

reliance on an unconstitutional statute?

15

a statement of fact?

16

MR. BENN:

No, Your Honor.

Were you making

I am making the

17

statement for purposes of analysis and perhaps I could

18

explain it this way.

20

already held unconstitutional by the Court.

This case is in a different context.

21

QUESTION:

So was Chico Drainage District.

22

MR. BENN:

Your Honor, I am not familiar

23

25

with that particular case.
QUESTION:

statute that held unconstitutional by this Court and then
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-8300

1

later reliance interests were asserted and the this Court

2

in a subsequent case said, sure, it was unconstitutional,

3

but that doesn't mean people don't do things in reliance.
MR. BENN:

4

Okay.

Your Honor, that would be

5

true, however, this case could be characterized

6

differently, and perhaps from what I am reading from what

7

you told me about that case, that was the judicial

8

acceptance of a reliance interest.
In this particular case, we have an attempt by

9
10

Congress to impose their own interpretation of what

11

reliance interest is upon the Court.
QUESTION:

12

13

Why shouldn't this Court recognize

Congress' choice as well as trying to make on of its own?
MR. BENN:

14

Your Honor, if there is an analysis

15

by Congress indicating that they have studied the issue

16

and have determined that reliance interest is present,

17

perhaps it could be accepted in that situation.
However, please look at this particular case and

18
19

look at it in light of some principles that the Court has

20

announced.

21

indicating that there are such things as reliance

22

interests.

23
24
25

There is nothing in the legislative history

Even the Solicitor in brief or the Secretary in
brief has had a problem in characterizing those interests.
QUESTION:

Why was there even an exception then?
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

MR. BENN:

Okay.

The exception was simply, by

2

our perception, something that Congress utilized in order

3

to buy additional time to study the issue of providing

4

universal coverage under Social Security.

5

6

QUESTION:

Whom were they attempting to benefit

by this exception?

7

MR. BENN:

8

QUESTION:

They must have had somebody in mind.

MR. BENN:

Yes, Your Honor, anyone who had a

10

legitimate reliance interest.

11

of Mr. Mathews, he has actual reliance interests.

12

is — What I am attempting to indicate to the Court is to

13

try to distinguish between an expectation interest and a

14

reliance interest.

15

QUESTION:

They were attempting to —

And, of course, in the case
That

Mr. Benn, may I ask, you mentioned

16

Mr. Mathews' reliance interest.

17

suggested the statute was discriminatory against his wife.

18

Which is it, discrimination against males or females?

19

MR. BENN:

Okay.

Earlier I thought you

The statute is discriminatory

20

against females because it provides less for their Social

21

Security contributions in terms of spousal benefits.

22

However, if you go beyond the equal protection analysis

23

and get into the specifics of what is being offered as the

24

justification for the statute, you are left only with the

25

protection of reliance interests.

authority of this Court in the area of equal protection

6

analysis.

7

If the Court will allow the Secretary in this

8

instance or allow Congress in this instance to pass

9

legislation to protect reliance interests, then it can

10

perhaps thwart equal protection review because, as we have

11

pointed out and as we have argued, in each and every

12

instance there probably will be some individuals who would

13

have relied upon the ostensible unconstitutional law and

14

could be protected.

15

For example, in the area of desegregation, this

16

similar approach could be analogized to the approach taken

17

in the exception clause by Congress or the states in

18

particular cases indicating that rather follow the Court's

19

decision in Brown, instead, what we are going to attempt

20

to do is we are going to allow protective reliance

21

interests of everyone who bought homes in particular

22

neighborhoods, reliance on the fact that they could send

23

their children to segregated schools, and continue the

24

effect of an unlawful statute and unconstitutional

25

statutes for many years in the future.

1

This is, as best our research can determine, the

2

first instance in which Congress has interposed an inverse

3

severability clause on a piece of legislation.

4

in light of the Goldfarb decision, there is some question

5

to the viability of the equal protection basis for the

6

statute.

7

Obviously,

Now, to the extent that we look to the

8

sufficiency of the remedy, it is Mr. Mathews' contention

9

that the remedy in this particular case to him is entirely

10

11

inadequate.
We had a very similar situation that came up in

12

the District Court in the Rosofsky decision based upon the

13

same exception clause, based upon the same principles.

14

that particular case, the District Court applied the

15

inverse severability clause and in essence required Mr.

16

Rosofsky to go remediless.

17

there was, in fact, found a constitutional violation.

18

There is no mechanism within the statute, the inverse

19

severability clause, in which Congress explored how they

20

wanted the inverse severability clause to be applied.

21

In

He had no remedy although

We have a second problem here and that deals

22

with retroactive benefits.

Now, on the one hand, if you

23

accept the principle of the inverse severability clause,

24

it is in direct conflict with Congress' enactment of

25

Section 204(b) of the Social Security Act which says that
40

1

benefits that are paid in good faith will not be recouped.
So, in this particular situation, from 1977 or

2
3

from the date of the order in this case, December 1979, up

4

until the date of this Court's decision, unless the Court

5

awards relief to Mr. Mathews, all benefits will have been

6

paid to his opposing class in direct conflict with the

7

intent of the inverse severability clause.
So, it would seem apparent that the Court must,

8
9

at the very least, award the class represented by Mr.

10

Mathews retroactive benefits back to the time of his

11

application and only apply perspective nullification of

12

the statute.
We would argue in the contrary that the best

13
14

approach to take at this particular point would be for the

15

Court to simply not nullify the statute, but extent the

16

benefits.

17

decision and analysis to Congress as to how Congress would

18

apply the situation in the future, but award the class the

19

back benefits for the time that they were discriminated

20

against.

21

At that time they could leave a reasoned

In summary, there are in essence three issues

22

before the Court.

There is, first of all, a statutory

23

interpretation issue which, if accepted based upon the

24

principles that the District Court of the Ninth Circuit

25

have announced, would allow a means in which this Court
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

could avoid a constitutional issue, yet at the same time

2

give some meaning to the statute and give some meaning to

3

the fact that the Court did have the Goldfarb decision

4

which was known by Congress at that time they passed the

5

exception clause.

6

The second aspect requiring affirmance in this

7

situation deals with the violation of equal protection.

8

The violation occurs to Mary Mathews because it provides

9

less benefits for her and her family unit than what it

10

provided to a similarly situated male.

11

On the surface, reliance interest does not seem

12

to be in this context of this case after there has been a

13

decision of unconstitutionality to be an important

14

governmental interest.

15

tailored because the class, as indicated by Mr. Mathews,

16

certainly are not offered protection for their legitimate

17

reliance interests that have occurred.
