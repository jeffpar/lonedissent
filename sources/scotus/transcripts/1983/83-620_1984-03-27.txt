ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. ETKINDi

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
This case is here on the petition of the

United

States to review a decision of the United States

12

Court cf Appeals fcr the Eighth Circuit.

13

preceding case, this case too involves the construction

14

of 18

like the

U.S.C. 1001.
The facts are not in dispute.

15

In early June

16

1982, Respondent telephoned the Kansas City, Missouri,

17

office of the FBI and reported that his wife had been

18

kidnapped.

20

that Respondent’s wife had left him voluntarily.

The FBI spent more than

100 agent hours

Cn June 13th, 1982, Respondent contacted the

21
22

Kansas City office of the Secret Service and reported

23

that his estranged girl friend, actually his wife, was

24

involved in a plot to assassinate the President.

Phoenix, Arizona.

She denied that she had been kidnapped, that

4

she had joined any assassination plot, or that she had

5

ever threatened the President in any way.

Respondent subsequently confessed that he had
made these false reports to the federal agencies in

As both the Second and the Fifth Circuits have

5

already recognized, there is absolutely no basis for the

Eighth Circuit's restrictive construction of this

statute.

And the Court has specifically counseled

13
14

against narrowing this broad language by construction.

15

In particular, there is no indication that the word

16

"jurisdiction" was intended to distinguish among the

17

nature of governmental functions.
In United States against Gilliland, the Court

18
19

explained that the purpose cf Section

1C01 is to protect

20

the authorized functions of governmental departments and

21

agencies.

22

thus was intended only to differentiate between matters

23

constituting the official authorized functions of the

24

department or agency involved,

25

of those functions, and matters outside the business of

This construction follows naturally from the

2
3

fact that the statute encompasses any department or

4

agency of the United States, without reference to the

5

nature of the jurisdiction possessed by the department

7

of the statutory language, the Eighth Circuit's

8

construction would virtually leave the FBI and the

9

Secret Service out of the protection of the statute.

But notwithstanding this all-inclusive sweep

Indeed, even the narrowest definition of jurisdiction

includes the power of the courts to decide the cases

are nothing more than policy considerations that are

21

more properly addressed to Congress than to this Court.

22

For example, Respondent contends that Section 10 01 must

not apply to false statements made to law enforc ement

26

committing perjury in open court, for which a le ss

But it makes no sense to say that Congress did

not intend statements made to law enforcement officers

to be covered by Section 1001, on the assumption that

Appeals and Respondent have severely understated the

seriousness of making false statements to law

investigations, but they bring to bear on the innocent

capabilities.

Not only may such statements

case would mean that false statements made in the

3

Eut in any event, there is no intrinsic reason

4

why the government should not be permitted to prosecute

false statements under either Section 1001 or the

perjury statute.

a choice of statutes under which it may proceed, and the

8

consequences of such a choice to a defendant in this

context will not be of great consequence.

Ms. Etkind, I understand your

2

report suspected criminal activity to law enforcement

3

authorities.

4

preclude any undue chilling effect, since only false

5

statements that are willfully and knowingly made are

6

punishable.

7

because information reported in good faith turns out to

8

be false.

9

But the terms of the statute themselves

There is therefore no liability simply

Finally, in the alternative, Respondent argues

10

that even if the Court agrees with our construction of

11

the statute, that decision should not be applied in his

12

case because at the time he made the false reports his

13

conduct was not criminal under the law prevailing in the

14

Eighth Circuit, that is, under the Friedman decision.

15

But there's no due process obstacles to

16

applying a ruling in favor cf the government to the

17

Respondent in this case.

18

Section 1001 contains a willfullness requirement there's

19

no danger that Respondent would be convicted in the

20

absence of proof that he knew that the acts he committed

21

were wrongful.

22

existence of the Friedman precedent in the Eighth

23

Circuit precludes Respondent's conviction is one for the

24

finder of fact in the determination of willfulness in

25

the first instance.

In the first place, because

Accordingly, the question whether the

10

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

But Respondent also appears to be making a

1

2

larger argument based cn notions of due process

3

vagueness and notice, that the mere existence of a

4

precedent in his circuit holding Section 1001

5

inapplicable to conduct analogous to his precludes his

6

conviction as a matter of law.
But Respondent's argument would convert every

7

8

arguable question of statutory construction into a

9

constitutional vagueness issue.

Respondent has never

10

argued that the words of Section 1001 themselves are so

11

vague as to fail tc give notice of the prohibited

12

conduct, as in Connelly versus General Construction

13

Com pan y .

14

Nor is this a case like Bouie versus City cf

15

Columbia, on which Respondent does rely, because there

16

the statute on its face gave nc indication that it

17

covered the defendant’s conduct, nor had it ever been

18

construed as covering such conduct.

19

Respondent’s retroactivity argument assumes a ruling for

20

the government on the substantive issue, and that ruling

21

would be based on the fact that the plain language cf

22

the statute does cover his conduct.

23

By contrast.

Respondent is thus reduced to arguing that

24

whenever courts differ over the meaning of a statute the

25

legislation is as a matter of law unconstitutionally

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

vague.

But that cannot be.

If it were, the government

2

would never be able to seek this court’s review of an

3

issue of statutory construction on which the courts of

4

appeals were divided, because we would be asking for an

5

advisory opinion.

6

And likewise, this Court would be precluded

7

from affirming a conviction in the face of a conflict

8

among the circuits concerning the interpretation of a

9

statute.

Yet the Court does sc regularly.
Vagueness must rest on something more than a

10
11

difference of opinion among courts and judges, and

12

Respondent has alleged nothing more and there is nothing

13

more in this case.
Finally, application of a ruling in favor cf

14
15

the government to Respondent here is consistent with the

16

opinion rendered in James versus United States.

17

James,

18

income of the embezzler, thus overruling the prior

19

decision in Wilcox versus United States.

20

conviction for willful evasion of taxes nevertheless was

21

reversed because three Justices believed that the new

22

construction should not be applied to him, while three

23

other Justices would net have overruled Wilcox.

In

this Court held that embezzled funds are taxable

James’

24

But, significantly, a total cf five Justices

25

were of the view that if a new rule were to be adopted

12

AL0ER8ON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62*9300

1

it should be applied to James, at least absent a showing

2

of bona fide reliance by him on the prior construction.

3

Indeed, even the view of the plurality in James is

4

distinguishable from the present case, since James

5

involved the overruling of a prior decision of this

6

Court.
The willfullness requirement of Section 1001

7
8

assures that Respondent will not be convicted on the
basis of conduct that he did net know was wrongful.

At

10

least in the conduct of this case, due process requires

11

no more.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be

12
13

reversed and the case should be remanded for

14

reinstatement of the indictment and trial.

18

As Petitioners accurately stated, the issue in

19

this case concerns statutory construction, that is, what

20

meaning should we give to the word "jurisdiction” as

21

used in Section 1001.

22

objections to the definition accorded that word by the

23

Eighth Circuit in the Friedman and Rodgers cases.

24
25

Petitioner raises several

As I understand her argument, she’s saying
that the definition that Friedman uses is overly

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

I want to

First with regard to the over-technicality of

Petitioner wishes this Court to adopt is an extremely

broad one.

I think she defines it in her brief as
Leaving aside for the

10

11

definition is hazy and overbroad and effectively takes

away any meaning that the word "jurisdiction" can have

in the statute.

She defines it, again, as "power to exercise

17

statute, although not all, come to the conclusion that

18

the materiality requirement inheres to the entire

19

statute, and they define materiality as any statement

that can have the capability of influencing an agency.

21

But the Section 1001 contains a materiality
Many cases that have discussed the

It is difficult to imagine a situation where a

22

statement would be material — that is, having the

23

capacity to influence an agency -- and not be within the

24

jurisdiction of that agency, as Petitioner defines it.

25

I think if Petitioner's alternative definition is

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

adopted by this Court, it is forcing this Court to

2

assume that Congress intended absolutely nothing by the

3

term "jurisdiction” when it used it in Section 1001.

4

think, this is a result that ought to be avoided at all

5

costs, particularly in a carefully worded statute like

6

thi s.

I

As to the general criticism that the

7
8

definition of the court in the Eighth Circuit is overly

9

technical, I fail to understand that argument.

The

10

definition used by the Friedman court fits well within a

11

common, ordinary understanding of that word.

12

admittedly the word "jurisdiction” is a word of many

13

meanings, many shades of meaning, but I think a common

14

thread

15

found in Webster’s and in the case law that have used

18

the word is some concept, some notion that there is a

17

final decision somewhere, that the body that has the

18

jurisdiction can make some act of finality.

Now,

through much of the definitions of that word

Perhaps not an act of finality for all times.

19

20

Certainly courts have jurisdiction, but they can be

21

appealed.

22

think Friedman was talking about the final act; I think

23

Friedman was talking about some positive power to make a

24

disposition of the case before it, and —

25

There's no question about that.

QUESTION;

Way I inquire, then;

I don’t

QUESTION*

5

Could you give me an example cf a

8

statement within the jurisdiction of the FBI that would

7

violate the Act?
MR. MOSKCWITZ*

8
9

The FBI as I understand it has

other duties other than merely investigating criminal

10

conduct.

I think they also provide information to

11

agencies regarding employee credentials.

12

a situation where a statement given to the FBI might

13

fall under the Act because the agency using that

14

information would have the final say in whether cr net

15

the employee is hired.

That might be

16

And that is to be contrasted with the typical

17

situation where the FBI investigates a criminal conduct

18

and makes no decision as to whether or not a crime has

19

been committed.

It merely presents the information.

QUESTION;

20

In other words, you'd say if it's

21

in the jurisdiction of some agency ether than the FEI

22

the statement to the FBI could violate the statute.

23

does there always have to be another agency beside the

24

FBI?

25

MR. M0SK0WITZ;

I think there has to be an

QUESTION:

3

There has to be an agency that has

4

some jurisdiction, and the FBI never has any

jurisdiction of its own?

6

HR. M0SK0WITZ:

7

It seems tc us that Petitioner's definition

That's correct.

8

requires an absurd result.

It requires an assumption

9

that Congress meant nothing by the word "jurisdiction."

16

It's right there in

and it has the beneficial side effect of according

Now, Petitioner also argues that it undermines

17

the statute, and I guess within that argument is the

18

assumption that there will be a gap in the law, people

19

who do bad things will not be punished, that the purpose

for which Section 1001 was passed will be undermined.

21

And I challenge that argument.

22

First, with regard to whether or not there’s a

23

gap in the law.

To be sure, there will be a limited gap

24

in the law.

25

is a lot narrower than has been suggested.

But I submit, first of all, that that gap

First, there is another statute available to

investigative agencies.

5 U.S.C. Section 303 allows

3

investigative agencies conducting certain kinds of

4

investigations to administer an oath to a witness.

admittedly these investigations are confined to fraud or

employee misconduct.

How,

Nevertheless, that statute is

Secondly, I maintain that whatever small gap

8

is left in the law as a result of the Friedman decision
10

is a beneficial one and should be preserved.

The

11

purpose cf Section 1001, as this Court has noted, was to

12

protect the integrity of governmental agencies.

13

an assumption that is not borne out by closer

14

examination to say that the Friedman rule necessarily

15

undermines agency duties, agencies like the FBI or the

16

Secret Service.

It is

17

First of all — and I think the Friedman court

18

addressed this in a round-about way when it talked about

1

the open line of communication that it is important to

20

promote, rather than to chill, that is, the open line of

21

communication between citizens and the law enforcement

22

agencies.

23

The Friedman result promotes that open line of

24

communication.

Petitioner's overbroad and, I submit,

25

hazy definition of "jurisdiction" chills it.

And I

undermine, agency functioning like the FBI.

3

4

any rule that would undermine that purpose would be in

effect to go against what this Court saw in Section

Secondly, an important aspect of an

I think Petitioner’s rigid approach to this

1

2

statute is going to have the effect of locking

3

witnesses’ statements in frcm the beginning.

4

to encourage them to stonewall it, it’s going to result

5

in a possibility of defective investigation and wrong

investigation, rather than to promote the emergence of

It is clear that what Congress was intending

to do in 1934 in broadening the false statements statute

was to reach, as one Senator said, all the buzzards, and

22

I think what the Senator meant at that point was, he was

23

talking about people who were giving false information

24

to newly formed regulatory agencies.

25

If Congress had envisioned the kind of

would have been some discussion somewhere about the

MS. M0SK0WITZ:

would have thought it less reprehensible.

What I am saying

Well, if they didn't think about it

MR. M0SK0WITZ*

20

Well, I think the lack of

21

Congre ssional awareness of the claimed scope of the

22

sta tut e is not dispositive of the question, but it is

23

instru ctive, and I think this Court has as recently as

in the Williams versus United States case which I

And of course, in that case, a very similar

case in many ways in that you were dealing with a false

4

technical definition of the word "statement" and the

word "check", and this Court in so doing noted that one

6

of the factors it considered was the lack of

Congressional awareness of the scope of the statute.
Now, in this case I think the facts are

It's a thorny issue.

The Friedman result, however, has the

beneficial effect of for the most part avoiding that

thorny issue.

16

that is not only commonsensical, makes sense, but it has

17

a side benefit of avoiding a thorny issue.

The Friedman result then is something

In conclusion with regard to this first issue,

19

the Friedman result gives meaning to the word

21

It does so without going far afield to find that

definition.

is consistent with and does not undermine the

It uses a reasonable, common sense one.

QUESTION;

Here we have the highest

Well, supposing you have only one

6

federal district judge in the Western District of

7

Missouri, and he declares the law for the Western

8

District of Missouri.
MR. M0SK0WITZ;

9

I think as long as Friedman

acts within the Western District of Missouri, then I

11

think

12

the result would have to be the same, yes.
QUESTION;

Sc then ycu would have S3 different

13

possible claims of retroactivity, depending on which of

14

the federal judicial districts you acted in?

15

MR. MOSKCWITZ;

I think that’s a theoretical

16

possibility, although in the 15 years since the Friedman

17

result has been announced there have been only two other

18

circuit courts that have addressed squarely this issue.

19

So while I think that's a theoretical possibility, it

20

doesn't seem to be one that is a practical concern.

21
22

23

QUESTION;

But they certainly addressed it

specifically, didn't they?
MR. M0SK0WITZ;

Yes, they did. Your Honor,

24

absolutely.

The decision couldn’t have been clearer

25

than it was, and I think the way the Rodgers case was

4

The fact that other circuits may have come to

different conclusions about the statute is fine for

those other circuits, but Rodgers lives on the Eighth

this is where he acted.

10

QUESTION*

Did he act relying on that law?

11

MR. M0SKCWITZ&

This is the issue I want tc

reach next, Your Honor.

13

Petitioner’s position that actual reliance is necessary

14

here, and I think there’s some confusion between the due

15

process argument that’s being made and the willfulness

16

argument that was addressed in the James case.

17

It is, as I understand it.

There is a willfulness requirement in this

18

statute, but there is nc argument here that the

19

Defendant is not guilty of this offense, if it is an

20

offense, because he wasn’t willful.

21

position of the Respondent, and therefore the James case

22

is not germane to Respondent’s argument.

23

That's not the

The case that is germane to Respondent’s

24

argument is the Bouie case, and the situation in the

In that case the defendants

There was no showing whatsoever in that case

3
4

on the record that I can tell indicating that the

5

defendants in that case were personally aware of a

6

narrow reading of the trespass statute involved in that

7

case.

8

they thought they were being arrested for a whole ether

9

crime,

10

In fact, there’s every indication to believe that

breach of peace.

It was only subsequent to their

arrest was the trespass charges brought.
Moreover, there’s some indication that they

11

12

wanted to be arrested, that they wanted to break the law

13

to make a point totally unrelated to retroactivity.

14

Rather than relying on some narrowly worded statute, it

15

seems that the defendants in the Bouie case were relying

16

on the fact that what they were doing was illegal in

17

some way.
And this Court stated in a footnote, I think

That’s correct, Your Honor.

But I think the result and the effect would be precisely
the same.

A legal act, when done, would be made illegal

10

retroactively, which this Court in the Bouie case found

11

impossible, and I submit that the same result should be

12

reached in this case.
Certainly if the legislature had passed a

13
14

statute reaching the activity cf F.odgers one day after,

15

there would be no question that that law could not be

applied retroactively to Rodgers.

act was committed.

10

MR. MOSKOWITZ:

11

QUESTION:

The heart of your

That's correct.

Yet there was a federal statute

12

that prohibited it, which may or may not say was

13

misconstrued by the Eighth Circuit.

14

MR. MOSKOWITZ:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Does that mean that because that

16

statute, if it comes out that way, the fact that the

17

Eighth Circuit had misconstrued a federal statute means

18

it was not unlawful at the time the act was committed?

19
20
21

MR. MOSKOWITZ:

I think that's what I'm

saying, Your Honor, not unlawful in the Eighth Circuit.
QUESTION:

In other words, it isn't Congress

22

that makes the law, it's the Eighth Circuit, in the

23

Eighth Circuit?

24
25

MR. MOSKOWITZ:

Well, the law is a combination

of the words of Congress as interpreted by the courts,

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

and in the Eighth Circuit the law, although written in a

rather broad way, had been interpreted by the Eighth

Circuit in a narrower way.
And in that sense this case is very much like

But wasn't it conceded in Bouie

that there was a change in law that took place after the

law was always the same here, it just had been

11

misconstrued by an intermediate federal court.

I think that is a position

13

that can be taken, that is a conceptual position that

can be taken.

problem of applying what is essentially a legal act and

16

making it illegal after the fact, something Congress

17

can't do and something I submit that the judiciary can't

do.

But I think that still leaves us with the

further, Ms. Etkind?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA A.

ETKIND, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

4

MS. ETKIND;

5

I just have one point.

I would

6

just like to address Respondent's point that our

7

construction of the statute reads the word

8

"jurisdiction” out of the statute because of the

9

materiality requirement.
I would just point out that the statute itself

10
11

includes a materiality requirement only as to the first

12

clause, the falsification or covering up clause, net as

13

to tha clause that pertains here, making any false cr

14

fictitious or fradulent statements or

15

misrepresentations.
Now, it is true that the courts have imputed a

16
17

materiality requirement to all cf the clauses cf the

18

statute, but I would suggest that probably is because of

19

the requirement of "in any matter within the

20

jurisdiction ."
I believe that I addressed, I anticipated the

retroactivity arguments, but if the Court has any

23

further questions I'll be happy to answer them.
