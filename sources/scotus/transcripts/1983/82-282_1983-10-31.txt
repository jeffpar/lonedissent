ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAUGHLIN MCDONALD, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR. MC DONALD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8

In 1964, Edgefield County, South Carolina,

10

one of the jurisdictions covered by Section 5 of the

11

Voting Rights Act, had an appointed system of local

12

government consisting of two commissioners who were
13

appointed by the governor from the recommendation
14
15
16
17

of the local legislative delegation, and an elected county
supervisor.
The critical date in this litigation is 1966.

18

In that year the appointed commission form of government

19

was abolished and was replaced by a three-member county

20

council elected for the first time at large from residency

21

districts. Although the 1966 legislation was a voting
22

change subject to preclearance, it was never submitted
23
24
25

to the Attorney General nor was it ever the subject of
declaratory judgment proceedings in the D.C. courts.

QUESTION:

Mr. McDonald, what was the nature

of the 1966 change that you are describing?
MR. MC DONALD:

The 1966 change instituted

a three-member elected, at-large county council with
additional home rule powers.

The prior local governing

6

body had been an appointed commission form of government,
7

8
9
10

two commissioners appointed by the governor and then
the third member of the commission was a county supervisor.
That voting change in 1966 was never submitted

11

to the Attorney General and as a consequence at-large

12

elections have been used illegally in Edgefield County

13
14

and have not been evaluated by any person, neither the
Attorney General nor the D.C. courts, to determine whether

15

or not they are racially discriminatory and their undeniable
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23

consequence has been to exclude blacks totally from member­
ship on the county governing body throughout the use
of those unlawful, unprecleared, at-large elections.
Nov/, despite the failure, admitted failure,
of the county to submit to the 1966 Act, the lower court found
that preclearance was unnecessary because the Attorney
General had, so the court found, in fact, precleared

24

the 1966 Act when he precleared a change in 1971 involving
25

4

1

an increase in the size of the council from three to

2

five members and the lower court held alternatively that

3

preclearance of the 1971 increase in size as a matter

4

of law precleared the adoption of at-large voting in
5

1966.
6

8
9
10
11
12

The Appellants in this case, who are black
residents of Edgefield County, submit that the local —
the lower court erred on both counts.
First of all, the Attorney General has made
it absolutely clear, both in correspondence with state
and local officials and also in briefs filed in this

13

case by the Solicitor General, that he was never asked
14

in the 1971 submission involving the increase in size
15
16
17
18

of the council to evaluate or preclear the 1966 adoption
of at-large voting.
The Attorney General has also made it clear

19

that he did not, in fact, evaluate or consider the 1966

20

change to determine whether or not it had a discriminatory

21

purpose or effect.

He never treated the 1971 change

22

as one involving the adoption in. 19 66, of a change from
23

an appointed to an elected at-large local government,
24
25

and that the 1971 submission was not a submission of
the 1966 Act.
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

The lower court's finding that the Attorney

1

2
3
4

General "must have considered" the 1966 change is wholly
contradicted by the record and by the representations
of the Attorney General.

He simply did not ^evaluate

5

the change made in 1966 and he has not done so to this
6
7

day and neither has the D.C. courts.

Mr. McDonald, what if the strictly

factual question of did the Attorney General, in fact,
evaluate the 1966 change was to be answered the way you
said it should, no, he did not.

But, nonetheless, it

was perfectly clear that it had been totally, adequately
called to his attention, all of the significant data
were before him at the time he was looking at the 1971
change.

Do you think the simple fact that he did not

actually get into the 1966 change was prevented from
becoming cleared as a result of the '71 submission?
MR. MC DONALD:

I think if a belated submission

had been made and if the jurisdiction had fully complied
with the submission requirements that the Court has set
out in Allen and the United States versus Board of
Commissioners of Sheffield, and if the jurisdiction had
made a specific, though late, request that the change
could have been cleared.

But, that was manifestly not

done here, because there was no request from the jurisdiction

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-8300

1

in 1971 that the Attorney General precleared the 1966

2

change.

3

on this point — The only request made of the Attorney

4

General was to preclear and increase in size of the council,

5

to preclear the 1971 change and —

6

The only request — I think the record is unambiguous

QUESTION:

Well, supposing that the 1971 change,

7

just as you said, and I don't doubt it is, but it makes

8

some reference to what happened in 1966.

When the Attorney

to me like something has happened in 1966 that didn't —

hasn't been called to our attention.

a supplement to your 1971 request for clearance all the

13

data that I will need on the '66 change.

QUESTION:

17

MR. MC DONALD:

But, supposing that had happened.
Well, if it had been submitted

18

and if it had been considered, then it could have been

19

precleared, but it was not submitted.

20

anything ever submitted to the Attorney General which

21

would indicate what the practice was in 1964.

22

is simply no possible way the Attorney General could

23

have known other than that he was pressured or was able

24

to devine from things that were not before him.

25

There was never

preclearance work is a matter of law to preclear the

2

1966 Act, but with all respect, that could not have

3

been —

4

QUESTION:

5

of fact, didn't it?
MR. MC DONALD:

6
7

Which I believe to be patently

erroneous on this record.

8
9

It was also concluded as a matter

But, this Court has made it clear that in order
to make a submission the jurisdiction has got to do —

10

It has to do at least two things.

I has to make a sub­

11

mission.

12

and Sheffield talks about making a submission, I take

13

it to mean that the jurisdiction has got to submit

14

sufficient information to allow the Attorney General

15

to make the kind of comparison which Congress had said

16

he or she must make under Section 5 of the Voting Rights

17

Act.

And, when Allen talks about making a submission

Now, that was manifestly not done here, because

18
19

there was never submitted through the Attorney General

20

any evidence as to what the practice in Edgefield County

21

was in 1964.
Secondly, not only does the jurisdiction have

22
23

to make a submission of evidence, but it also has to

24

make a request that a particular change be precleared.

25

That,

again, was not done here.

There is absolutely

8
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

nothing in the record to indicate that the submitting

2

jurisdiction ever requested that the 1966 adoption of

3

at-large elections be precleared.

4

The Voting Rights Act itself doesn't prescribe

5

any formal procedures, as you know, for the submission

6

of voting changes, but this Court has been very con­

7

sistent and quite explicit in Allen and Sheffield and

8

in City of Rome in requiring jurisdictions to make a

9

sufficient request and, secondly, to make a request that

10

11

a specific change be precleared.
It seems to me that the critical fact in this

12

case is that neither the Attorney General nor the D.C.

13

courts have ever done, with respect to the 1966 adoption

14

of at-large elections in Edgefield County, what the Congress

15

said and what this Court has said must be done and that

16

is they must be evaluated to determine whether or not

17

they have a discriminatory purpose or effect.

18

It has been suggested it is in some sense unfair

19

to the jurisdiction to require it to do so.

20

nothing could be further off the mark.

21

is one that is not discriminatory, then the jurisdiction,

22

if it submits the '66 change, will have it precleared

23

and that will be the end of the Section 5 issue.

24

will be out, if you will, a postage stamp and some time

25

of the county attorney.

I think

If the change

1

If, however, the change is one that is dis­

2

criminatory, and I would submit that one cannot read

3

the opinion of the single-judge court, the 1980 opinion

4

deciding the dilution claim in this case, and conclude

5

anything other than that the at-large system has the

6

most aggrevated and racially discriminatory impact in

7

Edgefield County.

8

If, indeed, the change is one that is dis­

9

criminatory, I think no one could defend the 17-year

10
11

non-compliance and non-submission by the local jurisdiction.
The Attorney General in this case did everything,

12

we submit, that he was requested to do by the local

13

jurisdiction.

14

involving an increase in the size of the council.

15

did preciselsy that.

16

envisioned that he would do.

He did exactly what the Congress

If there is any failure to comply with the

18

law, it most clearly is the failure of the local

19

jurisdiction to comply with the submission requirements

20

of Section 5 and submit the 1966 Act.

21

Appellants respectfully ask this Court to do

22

no more than to enforce the provisions of Section 5 of

23

the Voting Rights Act and to require Edgefield County

24

to submit promptly the 1964 change to at-large elections

25

so that someone, the Attorney General or the D.C. courts

will have an opportunity to evaluate those changes to

determine whether or not they have a racially discriminatory

purpose or effect.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA E. ETKIND, ESQ.

6

AS AMICUS CURIAE

7

8

Ms. Etkind?

MS. ETKIND:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

9

It seems to us that a theme underlying both

10

the decision below and Appellees' argument is that the

11

Attorney General should have known that the change to

12

at-large elections was involved in South Carolina's 1971

13

submission, because that notion presents great potential

14

for eroding Section 5 rights.

15

it first.

16

I would like to address

In the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Congress

17

was concerned not only with eliminating existing forms

18

of voting discrimination, but also with preventing any

19

form of discrimination local jurisdiction might devise

20

in the future.

21

The method Congress choose to protect against

22

new forms of discriminations was to require each covered

23

jurisdiction, before implementing any voting change,

24

to submit it for scrutiny by an independent body.

25

selected the District Court for the District of Columbia

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

Congress

1

and the Attorney General to conduct this independent

2

scrutiny.

3

This right of minority voters to be free from

4

voting changes that have not been found to be non-

5

discriminatory can only be ensured if the reviewing bodies'

6

attention is, in fact, brought to bear on the precise

7

change in question.

8
9

When preclearance is sought in the District
Court, that focus is assured by the requirement that

10

the jurisdiction file a complaint specifying the changes

11

it wishes to have precleared.

12

Similarly, this Court has held that when a

13

jurisdiction seeks preclearance by the Attorney General,

14

the statute requires the jurisdiction to state unambiguously

15

the changes it seeks to have approved.

16

When a jurisdiction fails to carry that burden,

17

preclearance cannot be based on a determination that

18

the Attorney General should have known that the change

19

required preclearance.

20

Such a result defeats the right afforded by

21

Section 5 which is the right to actual scrutiny of voting

22

changes before they are limited.

23

Such a result also inures who the intended

24

beneficiaries of the Voting Rights Act are.

Section 5 was

25

not intended to benefit the Attorney General or the local

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

jurisdiction, but rather minority voters are the intended

2

beneficiaries of Section 5.

3

Accordingly, this is not a contest between

4

Edgefield County and the Attorney General in which the

5

county's failure to make an unambiguous submission can

6

be excused by some purported contributory negligence

7

of the Attorney General.

8
9

For reasons I shall state, we dispute that
the Attorney General was negligent in his preclearance

10

of the 1971 submission.

11

under the statute is not an adversarial one, but more

12

of a judicial one.

13

compliance by the jurisdiction, any alleged fault by

14

the Attorney General cannot be attributed to the intended

15

beneficiaries of the Act so as to defeat their rights.

16

But, in any event, his role

Hence, in the absence of statutory

The requirement that a jurisdiction state

17

unambiguously the changes it wishes to have precleared

18

19

provision

20

changes by covered jurisdictions and places on them the

21

burden of proving absence of discriminatory purpose or

22

effect.

23

That

This Court has recognized that the Attorney

24

General simply does not have the resources to police

25

all the states and subdivisions covered by the Act.

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

He receives thousands of Section 5 submissions each year

2

and the statute affords him only 60 days in which to

3

act on them.

4

Moreover, as this Court has also emphasized,

5

the Attorney General cannot be charged with knowledge

6

of all the nuances of local law.

7

jurisdiction knows exactly which changes it wants to

8

clear and it is not too much to expect that it state

9

those changes clearly so the Attorney General will be

By contrast, the submitting

10

sure to focus on them and, thus, bring to bear the scrutiny

11

that minority voters are entitled to under the Act.

12

Here, it cannot be seriously claimed that Appellees

13

or South Carolina ever made an unambiguous request for

14

preclearance of the change to at-large election.

15

The court below found as a fact that South

16

Carolina did not submit the change before it was implemented

17

in 1966 and it is strange credulity to suggest that the

18

1971 submission was an unambiguous request for approval

19

of the prior change.

20

The only changes brought about by the '71

21

legislation, as Mr. McDonald said, which would redistrict

22

Edgefield County into five rather than three districts

23

and to increase the number of council members from three

24

to five.

25

The Act was so entitled and South Carolina

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

never indicated there were any other voting changes subject

2

to the preclearance requirement, much less requested

3

preclearance of them.

4

The court below relied on the fact that the

5

1971 legislation contained a provision for at-large elections

6

but the Attorney General knew from the face of the '66

7

statute that the at-large provision was not new in '71.

8
9

Appellees contend that the Attorney General
also should have known from the face of the 1966 statute

10

that the at-large provision was first enacted in that

11

year and, thus, was a change requiring preclearance.

12

But, the Attorney General did not know from the 1966

13

statute that its provision for at-large elections was

14

not a mere codification of prior law as was the identical

15

1971 provision and, in any event, what the Attorney General

16

perhaps should have known or should have inquired into

17

is irrelevant.

18

under Section 5 is actual scrutiny of voting changes

19

before they are put into effect.

20

The right guaranteed minority voters

Of course, if the Attorney General, in fact,

21

had considered a particular change, regardless of whether

22

he had been unambiguously requested to do so, Section

23

5 interests would have been protected, but that is not

24

what happened here.

25

The only information the Attorney General had

15

1

in 1971 were in the difference between the 1966 and the

2

1971 legislation.

3

change from a combined appointed, elected council to

4

a council entirely elected at large, he would have needed

5

the pre-1966 information.

6

In order to have evaluated the initial

Accordingly, if the Attorney General considered

7

the at-large feature at all, he did so only in the context

8

of comparing an at-large, three-member council with an

9

at-large, five-member council.

QUESTION:

Ms. Etkind, if we agree with your

presentation and conclude that Edgefield County never

the Act of 1971?

23

It wasn't file.

He requested

a copy of that Act and it was given to him in the context

of the '71 submission.

MS. ETKIND:

As I understand it, the Attorney

General does have that computerized system, but he didn't
have it in 1971.
QUESTION:

No files that would have enabled

him to check to see whether requests had ever been made?
MS. ETKIND:

Well, there were files and he

could have checked, but it is our submission that the
burden was not on him to do that checking, and in view
of the large number of submissions, that burden should
not be put on him.
QUESTION:

How many submissions are made in

a year now?
MS. ETKIND:

Well, in 1982 he received requests

Port Arthur case, but I don't remember the exact figure.

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. ETKIND:

9

Okay.
It is our submission that because

the change to at-large elections itself has never been

10

subjected to scrutiny under Section 5, the Attorney General's

11

objection should be in force.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KAREN LeCRAFT HENDERSON, ESQ.

13

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

14
15
16
17

Ms. Henderson?

MS. HENDERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas

the Court:
The single issue before the Court this afternoon

18

is whether or not Edgefield County, South Carolina, with

19

respect to its county council, is in compliance with

20

Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

21

2 issue and this is not a constitutional issue.

22

is whether or not Section 5 has been complied with.

23
24
25

This is not a Section
This

And, with respect to that issue, we have three
points which we would like to address.
Number one, the 1971 Act prescribed the current

18

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

method of electing the Edgefield County council today.

2

There has been no change since 1971.

3

Number two, the '71 Act was precleared in its

4

entirety; that is all of its provisions, the five-member

S

council, the five residency districts, the at-large method

e

and the two year term were all contained in the '71 Act

7

and they were all precleared in 1971.

8
9

And, number three, the home rule changes, if
they are Section 5 changes at all, were precleared on

10

August 28, 1975 when the Attorney General precleared

11

the Home Rule Act.

12

Now, the lower court found as a fact that the

13

preclearance of the 1971 Act precleared that Act in its

14

entirety and we submit that that finding is not only clearly

15

erroneous as it must be to be reversed, but it is immanently

16

correct that there was in fact and by operation of law

17

a preclearance of the '71 Act in its entirety.

18

The '71 Act begins by striking out all of the

19

election provisions of the 1966 Act and that is important,

20

we think, because the '71 Act specifically says the section

21

of the '66 Act which relates to method of election is

22

hereby — is amended by striking it out and placing it

23

with the following.

24

which add two members so that they now have a five-member

25

county council.

It replaces the 166 Act with provisions

It changes all of the residency districts.

2

There had been three.

3

composition of all five.

4
5

6

It adds two and changes the

It provides once again for an at-large method
of elections and for two-year terms.
It was submitted along with 17 other pieces

7

of legislation and the submission says simply this:

8

"That in accordance with provisions of Section 5 of the

9

Voting Rights Act, there are submitted herewith copies

10
11
12

of the following Acts" and the 1971 Act is one of them.
QUESTION:

Was there any reason why the '66

one wasn't submitted?

13

MS. HENDERSON:

14

The next act that took place was that the Attorne'

No, Your Honor, there isn't.

15

General wrote to Edgefield County and said that he needed

16

additional information.

17

voter registration statistics, he needed population

18

statistics, and he also needed the election provisions

19

now in force.

He needed boundary maps, he needed

20

That requested was acted upon and he received

21

all that he asked for including a copy of the 1966 Act.

22

His next action was not to ask what was in

23

effect on November 1, 1964 or was 1966 precleared, but

24

his next act was to preclear the 1971 Act.

25

preclearance letter says simply, "the Attorney General

And, his

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

does not interpose any objection to the change in question."

2

That is the enactment itself at No. 521 of 1971.

3
4

In other words, as this letter manifests, he
precleared all of the provisions of the 1971 Act.

5

Perhaps more important —

6

QUESTION:

7

May I ask a question?

The 1966

Act, do you agree that that was a voting change?

8

MS. HENDERSON:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

That was a change?

10

MS. HENDERSON:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, it definitely was.

And, is it your position that that

12

was implicitly cleared in '71 or it became unnecessary

13

to clear it when you had a different scheme in '71?

14

MS. HENDERSON:

Our position is it was superseded

15

by the 1971 Act because the 1971 Act provides completely

16

for the method of electing Edgefield County council.

17
18
19

20
21

QUESTION:

So, you do not contend that the

action in 1971, in effect, cleared the '66 change?
MS. HENDERSON:

We don't contend that it reached

back or — Yes, reached back and cleared the '66 —
QUESTION:

So, your position is that you —

22

that clearance in '71 cleared the entire statute regardless

23

of how many changes it made?

24
25

MS. HENDERSON:

Yes, Your Honor, we do.

we think —
21

And,

1

QUESTION:

And, regardless of how many features

2

of the statute were previous changes that had never been

3

precleared.

4

MS. HENDERSON:

Because of — Your Honor, that

5

is correct.

6

the fact that the '66 Act is completely struck out, we

7

think that it might have been different if the '71 Act

8

had said line 3 of the '66 Act is amended from three

9

to five and something like that.

10

Because of the way the statute is phrased,

QUESTION:

So, it really comes down to a question

11

of who had the duty to find out how many changes there

12

were.

13

have found out how many changes there were to satisfy

14

himself and his argument is you should have told him

15

what the changes were?

Your submission is that the Attorney General should

16

MS. HENDERSON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. HENDERSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is the whole fight.
I think it is important to

19

note that we were, back then in the early years of the

20

Voting Rights Act, and it was not too long after the

21

watershed case of Allen, and I think if we — I don't

22

know that we even need to compare duties, but I think

23

the Attorney General being charged with the enforcement

24

of the Voting Rights Act probably has more knowledge

25

of what it that was a voting change than Edgefield County

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

did at that time.

2

QUESTION:

May I ask this one other question?

3

it your submission would be precisely the same even if

4

the 1966 Act had not been given to the Attorney General?

5

MS. HENDERSON:

Yes, for this reason, and this

6

is what I am getting into and that is we think that '71

7

Act precleared the present method of electing Edgefield

8

County council by operation of law as well as in fact.

The Plaintiff emphasized that he had only the

1966 Act before him.

11

him.

12

requested and we know that he had the '66 Act.

13

know that he did not have any authority to stop at the '66 Act

14

unless it had been precleared and we do know that he was

15

required to under Section 5, compare it to November 1st of

16

'64.

17

pre-existing elements, even assuming that they had been

18

precleared, the at-large and the two-year term under Lock­

19

hart, and could have objected to those pre-existing

20

elements in the context of the '71 changes.

21

We don't know what he had before

We know he had at least the information that was
But, we do

We also know that he was authorized to review the

And, most important, we know that we must presume

22

that he followed the law, that is that he acted within

23

his authority.

24
25

The Plaintiffs say that there is nothing in the
record to show that he knew was at force on November 1st

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

of '64 and we say there is nothing in the record to show

2

that he didn't know what was in force on November —

3
4
5

QUESTION:

Was the '66 law ever presented to

the Attorney General for preclearance up until this moment?
MS. HENDERSON:

No, Your Honor, it hasn't been.

6

It was submitted in response to his request for the present

7

method of election in 1971.

8
9

We, of course, contend that that has been moot
ever since 1971, the '66 statute.

10

The presumption —

11

QUESTION:

Do you mean that South Carolina

12

has been relieved of its duty?

13

it for preclearance.

14

MS. HENDERSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. HENDERSON:

Its duty was to present

Yes, Your Honor.

And they have been excused of that?
No, Your Honor, we think we

17

have presented the present method of election in Edgefield

18

County for preclearance in 1971 and that it was precleared

19

in 1971 and there has been no change in the last 12 years.

20

This presumption that he acted within his authority,

21

that he did the only thing he was allowed to do, which

22

was to compare it to November 1st of '64, coupled with

23

no evidence to rebut it, we think, makes it conclusive.

24

But, we have even more information and that is in his

25

letter in which he requests additional information, he

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

discusses the other 16 statutes that were sent in with

2

this '71 Act and he says with respects to those 16, they

3

do not represent a change in voting practice or procedure

4

from November 1st of '64.

5

November 1st of '64 is a determinative date and we have

6

no evidence to show that he treated the Edgefield County

7

act any differently from the way he treated the companion

8

statute.

9

So, we know that he knew that

While we have the burden to submit and we certainly

10

don't dispute that, the Attorney General, once he has

11

a submission before and the duty to either object to

12

it or to preclear it and once —

13
14

QUESTION:
submitted it.

15
16

I thought you had said you had never

You just said you had submitted it.

MS. HENDERSON:

of electing the Edgefield County council.

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. HENDERSON:

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

We submitted the present method

But, not the '66 one.
That is correct.

And, that

issue —
QUESTION:

Be careful when you say you are

not including '66.
MS. HENDERSON:

No, Your Honor, I certainly

am not including '66.
When we submitted the 1971 Act, he had the
duty either to object or to preclear it and once he

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

precleared it we are entitled to rely on that preclearance,

2

we feel, without having to ask him did you compare it

3

do 1964, did you preclear everything, does your letter

4

mean what it says and did you do your job?

5

preclearance was correct or not, once it was precleared,

6

it was precleared, and, otherwise, as this Court has

7

observed, the preclearance mechanism might never come

8

to an end and otherwise the sufficiency of a submission

9

might always be subject to challenge as it is here 12

10
11

Whether that

years after we received preclearance.
Now, the Attorney General in 1980 for the first

12

time requested the submission of the 1966 Act.

13

the Plaintiffs say that this represents a consistent

14

position of non-preclearance and that it is entitled

15

to deference.

16

And,

We say that for nine years and through two

17

submissions the Attorney General assumed that the Edgefield

18

County method of election had been precleared as prescribed

19

under the 1971 Act.

20

the '66 Act in front of him and must have seen either

21

that it hadn't been precleared or if it hadn't been pre­

22

cleared, that it had, in fact, been superseded entirely

23

by the '71 Act —

24
25

QUESTION:

First of all, in 1971, when he had

You are saying then, Ms. Henderson,

that the Attorney General took a different position in

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

'71 than he did in 1980.

2

MS. HENDERSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

And, we think

3

when he had the '66 statute in front of him, he either

4

saw that it had been precleared, which the record says

5

that he did not do, that it had not been precleared,

6

and there is no record to show that it had been, or

7

he saw that it had been completely superseded by the

8

'71 Act and proceeded to compare all features of the

9

'71 act with November 1, 1964.

That was his first opportunity.

10

Then in 1979, when he objected to the home

11

rule ordinance and resolution which merely continues

12

this '71 method of election, he began his objection letter

13

by saying ostensibly this is the same system of election.

14

Now, that wouldn't have been relevant if he hadn't assumed

15

that the same system of election had been precleared.

16

"There is to be no dragging out of this extraordinary

17

federal remedy."

18

an 11-year delay as inexcusable, we think that this late

19

attempt, 12 years after preclearance has been obtained,

20

is also inexcusable.

21

And, as the Court in USC Georgia found

Now, the case should stop here because we have

22

a '71 preclearance, we have a stipulated fact that the

23

method of election has remained the same since 1971,

24

and we have cases and the Attorney General's own regulations

25

saying that a failure to object for any reason is not

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

reviewable.

2

And, the case, as I say, should stop there.

However, the Plaintiffs' second issue is that

3

the Home Rule Act effected changes which require a submission

4

of Edgefield County's ordinance and resolution, which,

5

as I mentioned, continue unchanged the '71 method of

6

election.

7

Act is in power.

8

Carolina counties.

The only change effected by the Home Rule
It expanded the powers of all South

9

The Plaintiffs again stipulate that the Home

10

Rule Act has only changed the powers; that is that the

11

method of election has remained unchanged by the Home

12

Rule Act.

13

of objection, appears to agree with it, because again

14

he says ostensibly this is the same system of election.

15

In other words, the Home Rule Act has not changed the

16

method of election.

17

And, the Attorney General really, in his letter

Edgefield County assumed these new powers,

18

these expanded powers, as of July 1, 1976, and it assumed

19

the powers pursuant to the Home Rule Act, which was pre­

20

cleared in August of '75 and the lower court so held.

21

The lower court relied on a decision from our

22

local three-judge court concerning Charleston County

23

which was in the exact same situation.

24

rule method of election which had been precleared and

25

it continued that under home rule and the decision, Woods

It had a pre-home

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

versus Hamilton, held that if a South Carolina county

2

kept its method of election unchanged by home rule, then

3

it would not need to submit its implementing ordinance

4

which merely readopts that method of election.

5

The Attorney General was a party to that law

6

suit and that decision was not appealed.

7

recently as this year, the Attorney General took the

8

same position in the case that is now pending in the

9

D.C. District Court involving Sumter County in which

And, even as

10

the defendant Attorney General urged the court to find

11

that the preclearance of the Home Rule Act precleared

12

only the right provisions which were the holding of the

13

referenda and the expansion of the powers.

14

The ordinance and the resolution itself, and

15

they are found in the Joint Appendix beginning at 183,

16

do not mention powers and they do not change the method

17

of election.

They simply continue the method of election.

18

Again, the lower court so held.

19

Significantly, we think the Attorney General's

20

objection letter notes its rather uncertain jurisdiction.

21

First, by beginning and saying ostensibly this is the

22

same system of election.

23

formal structure has remained the same, it then characterizes

24

its home rule preclearance as being beyond recall and

25

if the Home Rule Act had been something other than what

It later says that while the

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

was represented to us we might not have precleared it.

2

It is a very uncertain type of objection letter.

3

But, nevertheless, Edgefield County did make

4

a good faith attempt to comply with it and as the record

5

reflects it set up public hearings, it established a

6

committe to draft single-member districts, and then the

7

Woods versus Hamilton decision came, which said if you

8

are a South Carolina county and make no change in your

9

method of election, you don't need to submit your ordinance

10

and resolution, and, again, the Attorney General did

11

not appeal that.

12

We would urge the Court to affirm, of course,

13

on both of the issues, but particularly with respect

14

to the second issue; that is that the home rule changes,

15

if they were changes under Section 5, have been precleared.

16

Consider the effect of the implicit holding of the lower

17

court which is that they were, in fact, Section 5 changes

18

or otherwise they wouldn't have had to be precleared.

19

We think that before the Court expands the Voting

20

Rights Act into a non-election law; that is simply an

21

expansion of powers, that it should consider the language

22

of the Act itself, its own previous decisions, and

23

particularly the City of Lockhart decision where just

24

recently the Court said it had the entire election system

25

in front of it and could determine the pre-existing —

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the constitutionality of the pre-existing elements as

2

well as the changes, but never once talked about the

3

fact that it went from a general law city to a home rule

4

city; that is a change in power.

5

Accordingly, despite the second non-issue that

6

we think the Plaintiffs have raised with respect to the

7

Home Rule Act, we end with the identical issue that we

8

began with; that is the 1971 Act prescribes a current

9

method of election.

10

11

It was precleared in its entirety

in 1971.
To reverse the lower court, we think,

would

12

signal at least two things.

13

sufficiency of a submission is always subject to challenge,

14

even 12 years after preclearance was obtained and despite

15

the 60-day language in the Act, and we think the second

16

thing it would signal is non-election changes; that is

17

something like the expansion of powers is subject to

18

preclearance.

19

First of all, that the

But, if the Court affirms, on the other hand,

20

it would signal at least two things.

21

a covered jurisdiction complies with the Voting Rights

22

Act, that the integrity of its state and local legislation

23

will remain undisturbed; and, second, that the preclearance

24

provisions of the Voting Rights Act are to be limited

25

to their intended scope.

First, that once

And, all of this is not to

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

leave the Plaintiffs without a remedy, because pending

2

in this very lawsuit is a Section 2 issue, a constitutional

3

issue, and a 1983 issue, which, of course, go to the

4

merits of the present method of election.

5

The Plaintiffs also have, under our state law,

6

a political remedy, because our Home Rule Act now allows

7

ten percent of the registered voters of any county to

8

petition for a referendum to change to the single-member

9

district.

10

QUESTION:

Ms. Henderson, under — I would

11

think it is under your submission that if a locality,

12

city or county or state passes a new ordinance or a new

13

law and you just put it in the mail to the Attorney General

14

and say, please clear this, that that clears every possible

15

change that might be involved.

16
17
18
19

20
21

MS. HENDERSON:

No, Your Honor, that isn't

our position.
MS. HENDERSON:

Well, it sounds like it.

Do

you mean isn't the submitter supposed to go on and say
%
here is what we want cleared?
MS. HENDERSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

And those

22

are what the regulations require which, of course, were

23

not in effect in 1971.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, all right.

Would you say

then that just mailing the ordinance or the Act in 1971

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

would be enough?
MS. HENDERSON:

2
3

I think in 1971, yes, Your

Honor.

4

QUESTION:

You just mail it.

I think that

5

is your position, that you just mail the ordinance and

6

you don't tell them what change, it is up to him to go

7

and look up all the changes there are.

8

MS. HENDERSON:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, what were you supposed to

MS. HENDERSON:

Well, we were supposed to submit

it, which we did.

13
14

I think it —

do in 1971?

11
12

No.

QUESTION:
What was it?

Submit the Act or the ordinance.

Was it an ordinance?

15

MS. HENDERSON:

16

QUESTION:

17

else were you supposed to do?

18

It was an Act.

All right, it was an Act.

MS. HENDERSON:

Okay.

What

We submitted the Act.

19

Now, in the absence of any regulations, the Attorney

20

General then wrote back and said we don't have sufficient

21

data and here is what we need in order to have sufficient

22

data.

23

and, of course, I don't know what we would have said.

24

We probably would have said —

25

He did not ask us what changes do you want precleared

QUESTION:

But, you did say something when

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

you sent it in, didn't you?

2
3

MS. HENDERSON:

6

We said preclear under

Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

4
5

No.

QUESTION:

And, you didn't say what a change

was or —
MS. HENDERSON:

No.

No, Your Honor, we sent

7

the Act in and then the next thing that the Attorney

8

General did was to request the additional information

9

that he needed in order to make an evaluation.

10
11

QUESTION:

That is probably what led the Attorney

General to write and ask for the '66 Act, isn't it?

MS. HENDERSON:

13

And, I think the one thing that the Court should

Yes, I imagine so.

14

bear in mind really is that we were dealing with the

15

early years of the Voting Rights Act and really what

16

this case involved is going back to the pre-Allen days

17

where perhaps mistakes were made by the covered jurisdictions

18

and perhaps mistakes were made by the Attorney General

19

himself and at this late date, 12 years later, to try

20

to reconstruct what we meant when we sent it in and what

21

he meant when he precleared it, we think, points out

22

the difficulty of trying to do it, first of all, and

23

also points up the reason why the 60-day deadline is

24

in effect and also points out the reason why the Section

25

5 preclearance is not the only remedy available to —

QUESTION:

But, the Attorney General sent back

and said — wants the '66 Act and then he decided that
the change between — that the '71 Act effected as compared
to the '66 was all right.
MS. HENDERSON:

He precleared that.
He precleared the '71 Act,

Your Honor —
QUESTION:

But, your assumption also is that

he also cleared the '66 Act as compared with the change —
The change that was effected by the '66 Act.
MS. HENDERSON:

He precleared every provision

of the 1971 Act when he precleared the 1971 Act.

And,

at that time, the '66 issue became moot, because the
'71 Act provided once again for at-large and provided
once again for all of the features of the present method
of election.
QUESTION:
the '66 Act?

Where did you ever ask him to preclear

You never asked him to.

MS. HENDERSON:

The record reflects we have

never submitted the '66 Act.
QUESTION:

Well, how could he preclear it if

you didn't ask for it?
MS. HENDERSON:
QUESTION:

He precleared —

Under the statute.

MS. HENDERSON:

Your Honor, that issue became

moot when in 1971 the '66 Act was amended by striking

We do not maintain that it

MS. HENDERSON:

QUESTION:

And, the basic criticism of the

present statute is — well, both of the statutes, I suppose,
was in theory the elections were at-large.
MS. HENDERSON:

The 1979 objection to the ordinance

and resolution states that the new powers assumed by
the Edgefield County council in the context of at-large
has the potential for diluting the black vote.

So, they

The Attorney General never asked

No, he didn't.

MS. HENDERSON:

That is right.

So, we don't

operation of law he had to know it, because he had to
compare it to —
QUESTION:

He didn't have to compare it to

the '66 Act with anything.

All he had to compare was

the '71 Act with the '66 Act.
MS. HENDERSON:

Well, he could only stop at

the '66 Act if it had been precleared, because the
determinative date is November 1st of '64.
QUESTION:

Well, that is not quite correct,

MS. HENDERSON:

That is right, but when he

precleared the '71 Act, he had the authority to look

10

at all of them.

11

he could have objected to it in '71 if it had been instituted

12

in 1930.

13

And, if he had found at-large objectionable,

QUESTION:

But, under your view, a jurisdiction

14

could pass a new law with a dramatic change in it and

15

not submit it and the next year pass a carbon copy of

the new law and say here is what the old one was and

17

he would be presumed to have precleared the change he

18

didn't know about.

MS. HENDERSON:

No, Your Honor.

That is what

20

the Plaintiffs argue and I think that that couldn't —

What they argue is you could conceivable pass a blatantly

2

it would have to be precleared.

First of all, under Lockhart, he does look

at all the pre-existing elements, so he would look at

that —

that he didn't realize that there was a blatantly discriminato

what happened in the time period preceding the immediately

MS. HENDERSON:
QUESTION:

That is right.

You do answer Justice Stevens, back in

1971 he was obligated to look back.
MS. HENDERSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

The Attorney General?
He was obligated to look back if he

ever wanted to raise a question about any uncleared item.
MS. HENDERSON:

That is right.

And I think that

once the 60 days go by and once he has failed to object, for
whatever reason, whether it is under a mistake of law or a mistake
of fact, then the Court has held in Morris v. Gressette that is
not subject to judicial review.

But that doesn't leave an

unconstitutional change unchallengeable because you have still
got Section 2 and you have still got the constitutional
challenge or a 1983 challenge, all of which are still pending
in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, now, what is required for the

voters to prevail under any of those alternative theories?
MS. HENDERSON:

In the remaining issues?

The dilution

order that Mr. McDonald alluded to was vacated after the Bolden
decision, and pending now is a real hearing on intent, so that
if they can show that the at-large method of election has been
put in place intentionally —
QUESTION:

But if they can't show that, then there woul

be no relief under your theory.
MS. HENDERSON:

Your Honor, there is relief, and
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

there is relief that — which is what I was talking about before -

2

there is relief provided by state law, and that is the petition

3

to change the method of election to single-member district by a

4

referendum, and that takes merely a 10 percent petition, and the

5

black voters of Edgefield County, according to the latest statis­

6

tics, comprise 44 percent of the elected voters.

7

8

There is also a 1983 issue pending, and it is possible
that they could prevail on that or on a 14th Amendment argument.

9

To conclude, we feel that for the reasons which we

10

have stated today, as well as those that are contained in the

11

brief, we would respectfully urge the Court to affirm the lower

12

court.
