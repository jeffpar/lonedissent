ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. BATOR, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

6

MR. BATOR;

8

Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
This case involves the use and the regulation

9
10

of Lafayette Park and the Mall.

I need hardly belabor

11

the point, therefore, that this case is about places

12

that are very, very special, places that mean something

13

to every American and that really do belong to every

14

Americ an.
They are places that are intensely used for

15
16

all kinds of activities.

They are very grand and

17

beautiful, and thousands come in a spirit of awe and

18

reverence.

19

just to jog and to picnic and to play softtrall.

But it*s also the case that thousands come

These places are also much used, and fittingly

20

21

used,

for political demonstrations.

They are intensely

22

used for that purpose.

23

indicate that somewhere between 900 and 1,000 permits

24

are sought a year for special events and demonstrations

in the memorial core area.

there will be an average of three or so demonstrations

going on.

3

The case is f unia men tally about what sorts of

parks these are to be.

case is whether the National Park Service has the

authority to enforce a flat general rule that provides

7

that nobody may spend the night camping in Lafayette

Park and the Kail.

Now, Respondents asked for a permit to conduct

23

a demonstration in Lafayette Park and the Kail.

It’s

24

common ground that the purpose of the demonstration was

25

sincere, important and

serious, to demonstrate the

tragis plight of homeless people.

2

To do this, the Respondents sought a permit to

3

erect 60 tents in Lafayette Park and the Mall, and there

4

would be 150 people demonstrating there for a period of

5

three months, during which the 150 people would be

6

spending the nights asleep in tents in Lafayette Park

7

and the Mall.
The Park Service granted the Respondents a

8

wide-ranging permit to demonstrate.

Nobody tried to

10

prevent the Respondents from exercising their right to

11

speak,

12

redress of grievances.

13

come to Lafayette Park, they could speak in every normal

14

sense of that term as freely as they wished, they could

maintain a continuous round-the-clock presence, maintain

16

an aLl-night vigil.

to assemble, to petition the Government for a
Respondents were told they could

They could assemble and parade and leaflet.

17
18

They could use symbols and signs.

They could even erect

1

symbolic structures and tents in order to convey the

20

message of homelessness.

21

But they were also told that they may not use

22

the park overnight to sleep, and this lawsuit tests the

23

validity of that application of the regulations.

24

Government is here because the Court of Appeals of the

25

District of Columbia held in a six to five ruling that

the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech

2

applies to the sleeping activity proposed by the

3

dem ons trators.
QUESTION:

4

Nay I ask a couple of preliminary

5

questions, Nr.

Bator.

The Respondents indicate that

6

other demonstrators have been given permits by the Park.

7

Service to sleep overnight in the park.

8

question about the validity of that statement?
HR. BATORs

9

Is there any

Your Honor, the district court

10

found explicitly, on the basis of a record that I think

11

substantially supports that finding, that there has been

12

no discrimination in the application of this

13

demonstration; that in fact the Park Service has across

14

the board tried conscientiously to enforce the

15

regulation against sleeping.
It is the case that for a period of three

16
17

months, under a previous judgment of the Court of

18

Appeals of the District of Columbia, that court held

19

that the regulations in fact permit certain kinds of

20

sleeping.

21

amend the regulations.

22

The Government then proceeded forthwith to

QUESTION;

And the amendment of the

23

regulations was designed to prevent sleeping overnight

24

in tha parks?

25

HR. BATOR;

It was designed to prevent camping

6

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

and sleeping as a constituent of that camping.
QUESTION:

2
3

complete ban on demonstrating in Lafayette Park?

MR. BATOR:

4
5

Mr. Bator, has there ever been a

There had been a ban, I believe,

back -- I don't knov when the date --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BATOR:

Many, many years ago?
Many years ago,

there was a

8

complete rule against any demonstration in Lafayette

9

Park.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Would it be the Government's

position that that would be perfectly valid?
MR. BATOR:

Your Honor, it's not this case,

13

and in the case of Lafayette Park I think our position

14

would be that it would be valid, but we luckily do not

15

need to argue that position.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Why do you draw a distinction

between sleeping all night and demonstrating all night?
MR. BATOR:

The composition of the Park

19

Service regulations on that is to maintain a bright line

20

between the round-the-clock vigil and the camping,

21

sleeping activity, and I think that that is responsive

22

to the notion that the round-the-clock vigil is —

23
24
25

QUESTION:

You mean that there's a bright line

between sleeping and not sleeping?
MR. BATOR:

The bright line is between the

QUESTION:

2

How do you tell when somebody's

3

sleeping and when they're not sleeping?

4

that sleep with their eyes wide open.

ME. 3ATGR:

6

QUESTION:

7

I know people

Your Honor, the —
I mean, I was worried about that

bright line.

8

MR. BATOR:

9

sorts of activities.

The bright line is between two
I think, Your Honor, if you were

10

told -- if I were told that I'm allowed to go into that

11

park and maintain a round-the-clock vigil, but I'm not

12

allowed to use the park as sleeping quarters overnight,

13

I think I would understand that rule.

14

directed at two different sorts of activities.
QUESTION:

15
16

But precisely how do they carry on

the round-the-clock vigil between midnight and so on?

17

MR. BATOR:

18

QUESTION.*

19

MR. BATOR:

20

It is really

How?
How do they do it?
People do maintain round-the-clock

vigils in these parks.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. BATOR:

How?

Khat do they do?

They stand, they sing, they carry

23

candles.

There are many — the round-the-clock vigil,

24

as the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia has

25

indicated, is a fairly well recognized and

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-S300

1

understandable and important sort of symbolic activity.
QUESTION:

2

Well, you could also sit in a chair

3

or lie down, as long as you’re not sleeping, is that

4

it?

5

ME. RATCRi

6

QUESTION;

7

Yes, sir.
So you can enter a tent and lie

down and lie there all night --

8

MR. BATOR:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. BATOR:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BATOR:

Yes, sir.
— as long as you don’t sleep?
Yes, sir.
And you're all right.
Yes, sir.

Now, I’d like to say

13

why that line is in fact a very important line.

The

14

problem of the Park Service is not — that is, once a

15

given demonstrator is already there and he’s allowed to

16

go into the tent and lie down, you say, what difference

17

does it make if he’s actually allowed to go to sleep?

18

But that does not mean, Your Honor, that it

19

makes no difference to the parks whether the rule is

20

that you can sleep there overnight as part of camping

21

activity on the one hand or whether you're allowed tc

22

stand a round-the-clock vigil and if you want in

23

connection with that to pretend that you are asleep.

24
25

QUESTION;

Well, may he sleep during the day?

Does the rule bar him from sleeping during the day?

ME. BATOEi

1

The rule bars sleeping only if it

2

is a constituent of the use of the park for living

3

accommodation purposes.

4

regulation is basically to prevent the kind of

5

continuous and intense use that is associated with

6

actually coming in and occupying a place as a place to

7

live in.

8
9

That is, the purpose of the

And we think that’s an intelligible line, and
we think it makes a difference. Justice Brennan, because

10

the fact is that the problem of feined sleep and

11

pretending to sleep simply has not surfaced as a problem

12

in the management of these parks.

13

The problem of the parks is to try to save

14

them from the kind of intense occupation that is

15

associated with a general rule that you can come in and

16

camp overnight.

17

QUESTION?

Is that partly related to the

18

proposition that the park is there for the use of

19

everyone, including hundreds of thousands of tourists

20

that come to Washington --

21

ME. BATOEi

22

QUESTION?

23

around the flowers?

24
25

ME. BATOEi

Yes, sir.
-- want to take pictures, walk

It has historically been the

position of the Park Service that these places simply

10

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) S28-0300

1

are not suited for camping because they are so intensely

2

used by so many people for so many different purposes.

3

So that that problem of continuous occupation on the

4

part of demonstrators would create a severe strain on

5

the park and on the resources of the services.

6

QUESTION*

Mr. Bator, I have trouble.

When

7

they are camping there and not sleeping, aren't they

8

interrupting all this, other people?

9

be in the same spot at the same time.

10

MR. BATOR;

11

QUESTIONS

Two people can’t

Right.
You did give them a permit to set

12

up tents and to crawl in those tents.

13

deprives these people from walking around and looking at

14

the flowers, doesn’t it?

15

MR. BATOR;

16

QUESTION*

Yes, sir.

Well, that

It is not —

You agreed to that.

You also

17

agreed that if anybody goes to sleep on a bench, you

18

don’t lock him up, do you, for sleeping?

19

MR. BATOR;

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. BATOR;

No, sir.
If he just happened to fall off?
The finding of the Park Service

22

here. Your Honor, Justice Marshall, is that the threat

23

to the parks comes from a regime in which people

24

generally are told that they can stay for a long time

25

and sleep there.

The practice of people catnapping or

f eigni ng
QUESTION;

2

But they didn't bar that.

They

3

said you can stay there for that "long time", providing

4

you don't sleep.

Isn't that what the rule is?

MR. BATOR;

5

The judgment of the Park Service

6

is that if you have a rule that you have to maintain an

7

all-night vigil, that is not likely to threaten the park

8

in a serious way.

9

many people are going to come, how long are they going

10

That is, the question here is how

to stay.
QUESTION;

11

Mr. Bator, does any part of the

12

Park Service's liberality in the regulations

13

accommodating demonstrators stem from previous decisions

14

of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia?
MR. BATOR;

15

To some extent, yes.

The Court of

16

Appeals did hold here that an all-night wakeful vigil is

17

an important First Amendment activity.

18

Court of Appeals did have decisions about the erection

19

of these symbolic tents.

Similarly, the

20

To some extent, the Government has been living

21

under a regime of cases which do govern us quite closely

22

and gaite severely.

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. BATOR;

25

fact,

Not cases from this Court?
Not cases from this Court.

In

the only case from this Court, Your Honor, is the

12

case from 1972, which seemed to hold, although it was

2

not a case decided on the basis of argument and

3

briefing, but in connection with a stay application, but

which prohibited camping overnight in Lafayette Park and

Court in 1972.
I want to come back to this issue, which I

8
9

That was the Morton case, decided by this

think is important because it has concerned so many

10

judges, which is this issue:

You’ve allowed them so

11

much; why not this little bit extra?

12

Honors, that that asks the question from the wrong

13

perspective.

We think, Your

14

That is, retrospectively, once someone is

15

there, of course it may not make such a difference.

16

the question is, what system of rules will threaten the

17

parks?

18

and how continuously will they last?

19

But

How many of these demonstrations will there be

That is why we think it’s really the general

20

perspective and the general rule which says it does not

21

endanger the parks and it serves important First

22

Amendment purposes to allow people to maintain an

23

all-night vigil, an around-the-clock vigil, because that

24

can serve as a powerful communicative activity; but

25

actually going in those tents and going to sleep does

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

not involve, we think, powerful communicative activity

2

and, if allowed, creates a general regime that is

3

threatening to the parks.

4

We feel that one of the most fundamental

5

issues in this case is sort of the institutional issue

6

of whether you have a general flat rule to be applied

7

across the board to all comers or whether you have to

8

really do a case by case review in each case whether the

9

particular proposal to sleep in the park has an

10

important communicative or First Amendment aspect and

11

theref ore --

12

QUESTION!

Are there some -- are there any

13

cases out of this Court -- perhaps you've answered in

14

answering Justice Rehnquist , but are there any cases out

15

of this Court that would prevent the Park Service from

16

saying that no tents or sleeping materials will be

17

allowed in the park?

18

MR. BATORi

We believe, Your Honor, that there

19

are no cases that would squarely prevent that.

20

that the Court would have to examine the particular

21

circumstances.

22

I think

But our position —

QUESTION:

I take it that if the regulation

23

were amended to provide that, that you would be in

24

conflict with the Court of Appeals --

25

MR. BATOR:

Right.

QUESTION

MR. BATOR:

-- judgments?
Yes, sir, right.

But as far as we

3

know, we would not be in conflict in any direct way with

4

any 3f the rules of this Court.
QUESTION:

S

Well, I take it that, since you say

8

that the question is being asked from the wrong

7

direction, I take it that part of your submission is

8

that you could prevent any sleeping materials in the

9

park?

10

MR. BATOR:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BATOR:

We believe so, Your Honor.
Including tents?
The Government, we believe, has

13

tried to be, to take a position that does treat

14

generously of the business of demonstration.
QUESTION:

15
16

It goes farther than you think the

Constitution requires?
MR. BATOR:

17

I believe we have gone farther

18

than the Constitution requires.

19

beyoni the minimum.

20

important to be able to do this on the basis of flat

21

rules.

QUESTION:

I believe we have gone

And we do think that'it is terribly

Under the present regulations,

23

could a person put up a tent, let’s say a pup tent

24

that’s probably 25 sguare feet more or less, and leave

25

it there for an indefinite period, under the existing

regula tions?
MR. BATOR;

3

have a

permit for that.
QUESTION;

4
5

No, I mean with a permit, with a

permit.
MR. BATOR;

6
7

No, Your Honor, you would have to

The permits would not allow you to

do that indefinitely.

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. BATOR;

How long?

Is there a time?

I don’t believe the regulation

10

itself

contains a time limit.

11

for instance, what happened in this case is that a

12

seven-day renewable permit was given.

13

very much on whether competing applications were

14

receiv ed.
QUESTION;

15

But usually — I think

It would depend

If you have 50 pup tents, small pup

16

tents in Lafayette Park for seven days, especially at

17

this time of year, would you say that would interfere

18

with use of the park by other people, visitors,

19

touris ts?

20

MR. BATOR;

Yes, sir, and I doubt very much

21

whether all 60 — the 60 here were divided between

22

Lafayette Park and the Mall, and this was proposed for

23

December to March, so that the specific judgment that

24

this was a reasonable demonstration involved that set of

25

circum stances.

QUESTION:

Hr. Bator, may I ask this guestion

2

about the general rule, assuming — you say you want to

3

look at the general rule.

4

would prevent demonstrations such as the veterans march

5

of many years ago or Resurrection City or some massive

6

demonstration in the city of Washington for a very, very

7

important cause.

8

aggregation of people couldn't be assembled unless they

9

allowed some kind of camping or sleeping activity.

10
11
12

Supposing the general rule

And it couldn't -- that kind of

Would the regulation withstand a First
Amendment challenge in that kind of situation?
MR. BATOR:

Yes, Your Honor, the Government

13

does feel that it is important and not fundamentally

14

restrictive of the First Amendment to say that one thing

15

cannot go on here at all ever, and that's to move in and

16

sleep overnight.

17
18
19

The fact is that —

QUESTION:

So that demonstrations of the kind

I've described could really be prohibited?
MR. BATOR:

Your Honor, I don't think there is

any indication that very large demonstrations cannot go

21

on in Lafayette Park and particularly the Mall without

people being allowed to camp there.

I do not believe it is the history of the city

that you absolutely have to allow people to camp

wholly unsuited for camping.

I think that the traditional

7

I'd like to turn to another problem with the

8

contrary view here, which is the question, if you ever

9

permit it when do you permit it?

One of the very

10

important concerns of the Government here is that if

11

this regulation can't be applied on an across the board

12

basis we get into a very difficult, case by case review

13

of the question whether the particular demonstration

basically into content-oriented licensing.

7

that therefore what this comes to is case by case

8

licensing by the agency, and eventually by the court.

9

And it*s licensing that will be uncomfortably

con ten t-oriented.
I mean, this case is really an ironic

12

illustration. Your Honor, of the fact.

13

the Respondents and the Government are engaged in a

detailed disputation before this Court on whether

15

sleeping is or is not important for conveying the

16

message of homelessness.

17

QUESTION;

In this case,

Would you think it would violate

18

the First Amendment if there was a regulation

19

particularly applying to Lafayette Park that no one, no

20

one, could be in that park after midnight until 8:00

21

o’clock in the morning?

22

MR. BATOR:

No, Your Honor.

I think that the

23

Government would take the position that that would be a

24

perfectly valid regulation.

25

of that size and that uniqueness that are in fact closed

There are many city parks

We have not, the Government has not adopted

2

3

that,

but I think the Constitution would permit it.

4

think,

the Constitution ought to give the Government some

5

latitude in regulating these parks, as long as the rule

6

does not substantially infringe on freedom of

7

expres sion.
And really, Your Honor,

we feel that saying to these demonstrators, you can come

turns in shifts, you can speak, you can petition, you

can leaflet, you can parade, you can hold up symbols and

activity short of actually moving in and living here,

18

that that really does give generous scope for expressive

19

activity.

20

Your Honor, Justice Marshall,

position that camping is not allowed in these parks does

22

not entail a callous disregari of the message that is

hoping that will not make the case seem trivial, because

we feel that the fact that pretend sleep is allowed,

5

is really somewhat irrelevant to the case.

clarity the narrowness of the dispute that separates the

18

demonstrators and the Park Service in this case, both on

19

the facts and the law.

20

Factually, the Park Service agrees that the

21

demonstrators seeking to dramatize the plight of the

22

homeless may erect symbolic tents, that up to 50 persons

23

in a quadrant of Lafayette Park and up to 100 persons in

24

a small section of the Mall may maintain a 24-hour

25

presence in and about the tents, and may assume feigned

recognize that they may be there for seven days, not

There is no question but that these

QUESTION

What about a regulation that no

MR. NEUBORNEi

That raises the troublesome

10

question of the Court of Appeals decisions.

11

is accurate to describe those decisions as not having

12

reached the substantive question of whether there is a

13

First Amendment right to erect structures in a park.

14

All the District of Columbia held, and I take it the

15

reason why the Government did not appeal those cases, is

16

that the Park Service was obliged to apply a

17

nondiscriminatory rule with respect to structures, and

18

if it allowed some groups to erect structures then it

19

had to allow all groups to erect structures; that it

20

couldn't pick and choose on the basis of content.

21

I think it

7

Let's assume a small group wanted to hold a convention

8

in Washington and they decided that the hotel rates here
were too high and so they applied for a permit to bring

10

their tents and sleeping bags and stay in Lafayette Park

11

for the duration of the convention.

12

13

would be a permit the Government would have to grant?

16

MR. NEUBORNE;

I hope not, sir,

no.

Sir?
I hope not, sir.

I do not

17

believe that to be so.

In fact, the most plausible

18

interest the Government has put forward is precisely

1

that.

demonstrators are permitted to sleep as part of

21

expressing their message, it would be impossible to set

22

up a series of rules that will distinguish between them

and the conventioneers who are coming to town.

there are three reasons why that ad horrendum argument

doesn't work.

But the

nexus between the demonstrators' activities, the need of

degree of message and the concept of sleep renders that

group very different than other people who would come

it's convenient for me to do so, and secondly because I

The problem, the problem with this particular

22

case and the point that the Government so aptly makes is

23

that the reason that this is important to the

24

demonstrators -- I think it's a perfectly valid question

25

for both the Court to ask and for the Government to ask

35

is that, if we're willing to be so liberal, if the

2

Government is willing to be so liberal and allow the

3

24-hour presence, and allow the tents, and allow the

4

feigned sleep, why is it that the demonstrators feel so

5

strongly about the need to sleep?

6

sleep enough?

Why isn't feigned

And I think that goes to two particular

7
8

questions, two particular issues.

First, the question

9

of what it is the demonstrators are attempting to

10

express?

11

of homelessness, a fact which is, quite frankly, beyond

12

the collective consciousness of most of us — the notion

13

that there is no shelter, no shelter at all, and that

14

every night individuals, human beings in this country,

15

go without decent shelter; and that the central fact of

16

that is the fact that they must find a place to sleep.

17

They're attempting to express the central fact

QUESTION;

How is it distinguishable?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. NEUBORNE:

1

I think the distinction is

2

the distinction lies at two points.

3

the nature of the people traking the demonstration, in

4

the nature of the people involved in the demonstration.

5

In both Justice Powell’s hypothetical -QUESTION:

6

First it lies in

My hypothesis, you must accept it

7

assuming that the people who are doing what I suggest

8

are just as sincere and just as hard-pressed as your

9

people are.

10
11

What is the difference for First Amendment

analysis?
MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, in that case the question

12

might well be, are there alternative mechanisms to make

13

the point, and how closely is the activity connected

14

with the expression that the demonstrators are

15

attempting to carry out?

16

Here you have a group of people, the homeless

17

men, who lack any other mechanism for getting their

18

point across.

19

in these terms — what this case is not about, and what

20

unfortunately neither you nor I nor anyone else appears

21

to be able to do anything about, is whether or not

22

homeless people will sleep in the parks.

23

In fact — and forgive me for stating it

Homeless people will be in Lafayette Park,

24

they'll be on the Mall, they’ll be in the parks of

25

virtually every city in the nation.

The truth is we are

37

prepared to tolerate their presence sleeping in those

2

parks.

QUESTION:

Approximately how many people pass

by the mall between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00

5

in the morning?

6
7

8
9

ME. NEUB0RNE:
Marshall, very few.

I would assume, Justice

I myself have not been there.

But that goes back to the reason why sleep is
so important for this particular demonstration.

The

10

purpose of the demonstration is to attempt to jolt

11

complacent people into recognizing what it means to be

12

homeless, and the most effective way, indeed probably

13

the only effective way, since all of us have excellent

14

defense mechanisms that turn homelessness into a verbal

15

abstraction and that keep homeless people invisible, the

16

only effective way to make that point is to reenact in a

17

highly public place at the center of the nation's

18

consciousness — and that’s what these parks are -- the

19

light of what it means to be a homeless person.

20

And the notion of people sleeping in the midst

21

of winter without adequate shelter, without amenities,

22

without food, without the storage of belongings, without

23

any of the accoutrements of camping, solely to make that

24

point is the significance of this particular

25

demons tration.

38

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 82*0300

And the reason why these rules are so

1

2

important and the reason why they are so different is

3

that no society has attempted to reach out to the

4

disadvantaged the way this society has, to provide them

5

with a mechanism for entering into the public debate.

6

The First Amendment, were it confined solely to verbal

7

activity, were it confined solely to the classic means

8

of expression, would be a means of communication that

9

was open to the comfortable and the highly educated.

10

And what is extraordinary about our law and what allows

11

us to defend it against criticisms that the First

12

Amendment is really a repressive technique is that this

13

Court in two lines of opinions has recognized first that

14

non-verbal expressive activity is worthy of First

15

Amendment protection, and secondly -- and this is a vary

16

important point, Justice Rehnquist, in answer to your

17

first question -- that the free public spaces of the

18

nation, the parks and the sidewalks, are legitimate

19

places for the exercise of First Amendm'ent activity.
And when you put together those two lines of

20
21

cases, the notion that you can engage in non-verbal

22

expression and the notion that you can do so in the free

23

public spaces of the nation, you have put together a

24

mechanism that allows every segment of American society

25

to speak.

QUESTION:

Will you stop a minute so I can ask

you a question?

3

MR. '■TEUEORNE;

4

QUESTION:

5

If the parks are scheduled for other

6

activities -- softball games, soccer games, that sort of

7

thing — do you think that the First Amendment claims

8

can simply override those activities?

9

Of course.

Good.

MR. NEUBORNE:

Absolutely not.

I think that

10

there is an imperative of shared use, and I think if the

11

Government comes forward with legitimate reasons why a

12

particular area or a particular use of the park is to be

13

used by someone else, they have an absolute right to

14

regulate how the park is used in particular settings. '

15

This particular demonstration is scheduled for

16

seven days in the midst of winter, in one quadrant of

17

Lafayette Park and a small part of the Mall.

18

National Park Service were to say to us that someone

19

else wants to use it and they asked for it first, or if

20

they were to say to us that your use of the park

21

genuinely interferes with other people’s enjoyment, I

22

think we would not persist for a moment.

23

QUESTION;

If the

What if the Government were to say

24

that Lafayette Park is a very small place and as a

25

result we’re not going to allow any demonstrations.

40

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

It

interferes with too many tourists.

They like to see the

2

park just as kind of like a green pleasant place.

3

don't like the hassle cf demonstrations.

equally visible, and we're just not going to have

Lafayette Park used for demonstrations.

If you want to

Is there anything wrong with that?

8

HR. NEUBORNE:

9

They

I think there are areas of the

park, for example the areas near the Washington

10

Monument, the area surrounding the Lincoln Memorial,

11

which have traditionally been recognized as places of

12

serenity and contemplation.

13

to designate Lafayette Park as such an area of serenity

14

and contemplation, I think it would be a serious

15

mistake, because that has come to be a traditional place

16

of the exchange of ideas.

18

find were the Park Service

It is the closest thing we

But were the Park Service to do that and were

19

there to be sufficient alternative places to express

20

oneself, I would have no objection to that.

21

I hope that you don't believe that the

22

argument here is an argument for absolute use of parks

23

whenever a First Amendment person wishes to do so.

24

is sinply this:

it the obligation is on them to come forward with a

2

reason, with a genuine need to do so.

3

And we believe on the facts of this case they

4

have simply failed to come forward with their reason.

5

There might be other cases, but not --

6

QUESTION

Well, is it really so unreasonable,

7

though, to say that in a tiny fragile park, like

8

Lafayette Park that you can't camp out?

9

these other things, but you can't camp out.

10

11

You can do all
Is that

really unreasonable?
MR. NEUBORNE:

Were there a showing that the

12

camping out, Justice O'Connor, that the sleeping in some

13

way incrementally interfered with the park — you see,

14

the problem is of course, on the facts of this case the

15

act of sleep, the act of actually remaining there, which

16

is quite important to the demonstrators as a

17

communicative mechanism, the act of remaining there to

18

sleep through the night in no way increases the

19

intensity of the park use.

20

So that the problem is, on the facts of this

21

case the Government simply hasn't made its showing.

22

There may be other cases.

23

where a particular --

24
25

QUESTION;

There may be other situations

Mr. Neuborne, I wonder if that's

consistent with the record.

It seems to me there are

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

two ways to look at this case.

2

thing that's at stake is whether they lie there and

3

pretend they're asleep or actually sleep,

4

roughly the same number of people as otherwise.

6

One is that the only

and you have

Or alternatively — and this is what I

6

understand the facts to be — it may be that unless

7

they're allowed to sleep they really won't come, a

8

significant number of people will not be there.

9

that's what your application said.

And

So the difference as

10

I understand it is not just this hairline between

11

feigned sleeping and real sleeping.

12

between what the Government would call camping and you

13

would call demonstrating and just not having it, having

14

no such activity.

15

HR. NEUBORNE:

It's the difference

Well, first. Justice Stevens,

18

we have agreed and I think the Government recognizes

17

that there is complete agreement on the maximum number.

18

We’re talking about a maximum number of 50 people.

19

QUESTION:

I understand, but your own

20

application says that the maximum number will never be

21

there unless they can sleep.

22

look at the case as the sleeping is a function that must

23

be performed in order to let the demonstration be

24

successful, sort of like saying you’ve got to be able to

25

camp somewhere if you're going to have a Resurrection

So that you can really

43

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

City -- a functional need, in order to have an overall

2

demonstration, which is quite different from the thing

3

you've both been arguing about, namely that you're

4

assuming everybody's out there pretending their asleep

5

when we know that's not true; they are not going to be

6

there unless they can sleep.

7

MR. NEUBORNEs

I agree, Your Honor, Justice

8

Stevens, that were the sleep here solely facilitative,

9

were it simply a mechanism to make it easier to conduct

10

the demonstration, while that is a non-constitutional

11

factor that the Park Service might take into account, it

12

is certainly not constitutionally obliged to do so.

13

that is not the basis on which we argue here.

14

QUESTION;

I realize it's not the basis on

15

which you argue, but it's what you said in your

16

application.

17

ftnd

MR. NEUBCRNE:

But there is a linkage between

18

that statement and the communicative elements as well,

19

and that is a recognition -- and this is a biological

20

recognition — of what it means to be a homeless person

21

and on the street all day.

22

It would be dishonest for us to represent to

23

the Park Service that we could go along with a

24

requirement to feign sleep and have homeless people at

25

the demonstration, because as a biological fact, once

By

That is, that is one of the principal

4
5

stumbling blocks in accepting what is a generous attempt

6

to allow First Amendment activity in the park, and that

7

is, if one suggests that one can only feign sleep, one

8

cannot actually sleep, one then defines homeless people

9

out of the demonstration, because it is simply

10

physically impossible for a homeless person.

11

20

must be permitted or else the demonstration simply

21

cannot take place.

22

And that is why if homeless people are to be

There is, and this is of course quite

23

anticlimactic, a non-constitutional way to review this

case as well, which I hope the Court will consider.

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

It

1

approaches in this area, and that is to look closely at

2

the regulation and ascertain whether it in fact bans the

3

activity that the demonstrators hope to engage in.
The regulation, which is set forth in the

4
5

Petitioners' breach at Appendix 1A, the regulation

6

forbiis using the park as a living accommodation, and it

7

sets up a totality of the circumstances test to

8

determine whether or not a living accommodation is in

9

fact being carried out.

And among the various indicia

10

is cooking, breaking the earth, storage of personal

11

belongings, and sleeping.

Did you present this argument to

the Court of Appeals?

MR. NEUBORNE:

to deal with the Court of Appeals decision.

12

to suggest that it dees not bar the activity at issue

here.

14

Where there are two plausible construetions,

15

one of which would avoid a difficult constitutional
