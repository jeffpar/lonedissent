ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JUDITH A. GORDON, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

MRS. GORDON:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

please the Court:
The principal question presented is whether a
New York State Family Court judge violates the due process

10

clause when he detains an accused juvenile delinquent

11

after he has conducted a detention hearing and after he

12

has found, based on facts and reasons elicited at that

13

hearing that there is a serious risk that the juvenile,

14

released, will commit a pre-trial crime.

15

When the judge acts in this premise, he relies

16

on specific statutory authority, namely,

17

320.5(3) (b) of New York's Family Court Act, which is the

18

statute involved in this appeal.

19

Section

The appeal is from the United States Court of

20

Appeals for the Second Circuit and it arises in the

21

proceedings brought by detained juveniles for a class

22

writ of habeas corpus and for a declaratory judgment.

23

if

I will address Section 320.5(3 ) (b)

and related

24

provisions of Article 3

initially and I do so both to

25

inform the Court about the procedural constraints that New

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

York imposes on the judicial decision to detain an accused

2

delinquent prior to trial and to rebut at the same time

3

several alleged deficiencies in this procedures which were

4

assigned to it in the opinions below and are noted by

5

Appellees.
I will then turn to Appellees' two principal

6
7

arguments under Mathews versus Eldridge, namely, that some

8

crimes must be excluded from Section 320.5(3)(b) and that

9

some guidelines for judicial decision making must be added

10

so that the statute would survive scrutiny under the due

11

process clause
QUESTION:

12

What are the conditions on which an

13

adult offender, given all the same factors, could be

14

detained before a trial?

15

MRS. GORDON:

16

QUESTION:

17

MRS. GORDON:

In New York, Your Honor?

Yes, in New York.
In New York — New York provides

18

bail for adults and does not have a preventive detention

19

statute.

20

law generally does take at least some account of future

21

crime in the community if that is your point.

It has been noted, however, that New York's bail

Of course Your Honor is aware that the District

22
23

of Columbia itself does have a preventive detention

24

statute which was cert denied in United States versus

25

Edwards.

I believe it was the term before last.

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

And, we

1

suggest — we contend — that our statute is identical in

2

all material respects to Edwards and, accordingly, would

3

pass muster in the same manner.

4

Appellees do make one other argument other than

5

their Mathews argument and that is that pre-trial

6

detention to prevent crime as distinguished from pre-trial

7

detention to assure appearance at trial is constitutional

8

punishment and we have addressed that argument in our

9

reply brief at pages 1 through 11.

10

Turning to the —

11

QUESTION:

In your view what constitutional

12

limits are there on a state's authority to detain people

13

who are not accused of any crime to prevent them from

14

committing future crimes?

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

MRS. GORDON:

People who are accused of a crime

to prevent them from committing a crime?
QUESTION:

Who are not.

Can you detain somebody

if they are not?
MRS. GORDON:

No, Your Honor, you cannot detain

somebody that has not been accused of a crime —
QUESTION:

All right.

And, if they have been

22

accused of a crime, what constitutional limits are there

23

in your view?

24
25

MRS. GORDON:

We would suggest, Your Honor, that

there are two separate constitutional limits.

One is

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

quite important and one you have heard a great deal about

2

today and that the Fourth Amendment and probable cause.

3

That is not quite — Well, probable cause is noted by

4

Appellees in the course of their discussion.

5

not really made a separate Fourth Amendment challenge.
QUESTION:

6
7

Do you think that is a requirement,

probable cause?
MRS. GORDON:

8
9

They have

I think that probable cause in the

sense of Gerstein, which we believe is met under this

10

statute, and in the sense of New York's further

11

requirement that there be an adversarial probable cause

12

hearing for these juvenile, which the prosecution has the

13

burden, that that probable cause requirement is well met

14

in this case.

15

finding of probable cause must be present at the time of

16

detention.

17

We do not suggest that an affirmative

In other words, it is sufficient in our view

18

that it is provided and the child be given an opportunity

19

to negative it at the time of detention and that it is

20

there after found based on the prosecutor's burden.

21

22
23
24
25

In other words, it need not be simultaneously
affirmatively found.
QUESTION:

Is there any other constitutional

1imitations?
MRS. GORDON:

Yes, Your Honor, absolutely, and

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that arises from the existence of the detention or perhaps

2

if you want to call it conversely, the release statute

3

itself.

4

the same sense as any other statute that creates an

5

interest in property or liberty would have a due process

6

relation.

7

And, that statute has a due process relation in

And the appropriate test for that statute is the

8

Mathews versus Eldridge test and it involves both

9

considerations of it permissibility under the due process

10

clause and the appropriate measure of the process that is

11

due which is exactly the issue we addressed in this case,

12

the principal issue we addressed in this case.

13

Returning to the statutory scheme, I think it is

14

significant that we know, first of all, who the person is

15

or who the child is that is involved.

16

according to New York law is — the juvenile delinquent

17

under New York law is an individual who commits an act

18

between the ages of 7 and 16 which, if done by an adult,

19

would be a crime.

20

And, the juvenile,

Under Section 302.2 of the Family Court Act, the

21

Family Court's jurisdiction is not quite so confined.

A

22

juvenile who has done that conduct within the 7 to 16 age

23

range may be prosecuted in the Family Court until he is 20

24

if a designated felony is involved or until he is 18 if

25

another felony or misdemeanor is involved.

A designated

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

felony is — We provide a list of them for you at page 6

2

of our brief in the second footnote.

3

list of crimes allocated by age which permit a Family

4

Court judge sitting at disposition, which is the analog of

5

sentencing, to give an initial placement period of three

6

to five years which is somewhat higher than the 12 to 18

7

month initial placement period that is available for other

8

crimes.

9

It is essentially a

The place at which — The proceeding at which

10

detention may be considered is called an initial

11

appearance and if a child has been detained on an

12

emergency basis by an admitting detention authority, who

13

is represented here today by the New York City Department

14

of Juvenile Justice which is administered by Appellant, if

15

he has been admitted to such an agency on an emergency

16

basis, this initial appearance where detention may be

17

considered, must be on the next court day and never set

18

more than 72 hours later.

19

If the child has not been detained, in other

20

words he has been released by the police after his arrest,

21

his initial appearance is within ten days.

22

And, I call your attention to a new provision of

23

the statute, noting parenthetically that this juvenile

24

delinquency procedural code was recently amended and all

25

the amendments became effective last July.

And, there are

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

some differences between the new law and the old law and

2

this is one of the differences.
QUESTION:

3
4

same?
MRS. GORDON:

5

6

Is the probable cause standard the

The probable cause standard is

exactly the same, Your Honor.
There is one difference, however, the police, on

7

8

releasing the child, must give him an appearance ticket

9

and the appearance ticket now must provide that in a

10

designated felony he must return to court within 72 hours

11

and in other cases, crimes charged, he must return within

12

14 days.
This makes some difference in looking at the

13
14

opinions below and in noting Appellees' brief, because one

15

of the assignments of error in this case is that somehow

16

the police decision to release a child rather than detain

17

him or bring him directly to the court, made, according to

18

the district judge and Appellees, the judge's decision,

19

who was sitting in that court later, error because he

20

decided to detain him and the gap in time between the time

21

the child was originally arrested and released and

22

ultimately appeared in court and when detained was pointed

23

out as an inadequacy in the statute, although, of course,

24

it relies on the police decision and not on the judge's

25

decision.

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

In any event, the new provision of the law now

1

2

restricts the time limit the child could possibly be on

3

the street if the police arrest him.
QUESTION:

4

Do you think there are stronger

5

reasons to apply this restraint on juveniles than on

6

adults?
MRS. GORDON:

7

Absolutely.

8

they are stronger, Your Honor.

9

different.

I don't know whether

I think they are

And, essentially they are as follows:

does not have, at least in the same form that it has with

16

respect to the juvenile, and that is child protective

3

QUESTION:

5

New York has those interests in the child.

You are suggesting that liquor store

owners shoot people, I think, who are 18 but not 14?

6

(Laughter)

7

MRS. GORDON:

8

The point I was trying to make was that the

9

In

I am sorry, Your Honor.

state has an interest in keeping the child harm free, and

10

while it may have some interest in that with respect to

11

adults, it has a stronger interest with respect to the

12

child.

That is the only point.

13

In addition, Your Honor, we would also say that

14

the child's pre-trial interest in liberty is not the same

15

as an adult.

16

unemancipated minor is dependence and custodial status.

17

Obviously, an adult does not have an absolute right to

18

freedom, that is certainly true, but he certainly has a

19

higher right than the child.

20

relation make what I would submit to you is a match in

21

favor of the state interest in preventive detention,

22

pre-trial preventive detention for juveniles, which match

23

might not turn out to be the same if one carried the

24

analog to the adult, to adult pre-trial —

That is correct.

There is a difference, isn't there?

MRS. GORDON:

That is correct.

On that one hypothetical.
There is a further difference

7

which I think follows from my elaboration to the Chief

8

Justice and that is New York has a stronger interest, I

9

think, in preventing that juvenile from committing any

10

further crime than it perhaps has in the adult.

11

to the juvenile from committing that crime is higher than

12

the adult charged with petty larceny.

13

And, perhaps more importantly —

QUESTION:

The risk

Are you sure that a juvenile in the

15

average juvenile home is better off on not committing

another crime and not learning how to commit another

QUESTION:

21

Do you mean —

The average juvenile home is not as

conducive to good living as a home is, the average home.
MRS. GORDON:

It depends a lot, as our detention

22

specialist said, and indeed the detention expert for the

23

City of the trial below, it depends a lot on the home,

24

Your Honor.

25

then perhaps any home is better, and that is not to

suggest that there is anything wrong with the detention

2

facilities that we have.
I would call one other fact to your attention,

3
4

Your Honor.

5

larceny may be considered for detention, I say that

6

advisedly, because in the juvenile case histories that are

7

presented to you by the Appellees, there is at least — I

8

believe at least two petty larcenists.

9

first offenders, Your Honor.

10

When I say that a juvenile accused of petty

None of them were

They had records of seven,

six, five prior contacts with the Family Court.
QUESTION:

11

Well, I do assume that in the City of

12

New York you have found at least one first offender

13

juvenile.

14

MRS. GORDON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MRS. GORDON:

Who was detained?

Well, are there any?
These are Appellees' exhibits.

17

They were Petitioners' below.

18

QUESTION:

They —

Do you say there are no — How do you

19

get the second offenders up there if you don't have any

20

first ones?

21

(Laughter)

22

QUESTION:

Are you able to shed any light —

23

What is the practice if you know with respect to first

24

offenders?

25

Are they detained for shoplifting?
MRS. GORDON:

First offenders are considered for

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 620-9300

For any detention, there must be facts and

1

detention.

2

reasons on the record that are developed at this hearing.

3

If we look at these hearings, at least so far as

4

we have them in the record, and we only have 34, we find

5

not merely criminal — the commission of a crime, but as

6

Appellees' witness below, the psychiatric witness below,

7

Dr. Zinn testified, a pattern, associated character­

8

istics — In other words we find a child who is charged

9

with committing a crime who is also not being supervised

10

at home, who, when he was arrested, lied to the police,

11

who is a truant at school.

12

combination of associated characteristics which are called

13

a delinquent pattern.

14

In other words, you find a

Now, we do not have in this record, and so far

15

as we know from the information that we have, Mr. Chief

16

Justice, we don't have a single petty larcenist detained.

17

That is all we can say because the data is not assembled

18

any other way and Appellees, who are attempting to prove

19

their point, I assume, in showing us that there were minor

20

criminals who were detained who did not have records, did

21

not provide us with that information.

22

Just returning briefly to the statutory scheme,

23

at this initial appearance, the juvenile has all due

24

process rights that this Court has heretofore elaborated.

25

He is for a preliminary stage of a proceedings and indeed

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

some others.

He is present, he is represented by counsel,

2

he has the right to remain silent, he has the right to

3

oppose any information offered against him, and he has the

4

right to offer information on his own behalf.

5

The judge, if he comes to the detention decision

6

at all, must pass through two release options, options for

7

conditional and unconditional release, much like the

8

Federal Bail Statute, one must pass through some

9

unconditional release options, much like the District of

10

Columbia Preventive Detention Statute where the judge must

11

also pass through some release options.

12

Judge Quinones, who testified below for the

13

state, indicated, I think quite eloquently, exactly how a

14

judge comes to this concludion and that is — He said, and

15

this a point of the application of the statute, Chief

16

Justice, he starts with absolutely no detention.

17

words, he starts essentially opposed to detention.

18

then facts and circumstances are developed at this

19

hearing, then those facts and circumstances overcame or

20

may have overcome what Judge Quinones called the strong

21

presumption against detention.

22

QUESTION:

In other
If

I guess there are no statutory

23

requirements in that require under the New York scheme, is

24

that right, for what the judge has to consider?

25

MRS. GORDON:

No.

There are no additional

16

440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

criteria, as Appellees call them, or guidelines for

2

decision making other than the standard itself which is

3

precise, serious risk of pre-trial crime.
QUESTION:

4
5

Court decision to detain a juvenile?
MRS. GORDON:

6
7

The decision is reviewable by

several routes, generally by writ.
Now, Appellees say that this really is a

8
9

What review is there of the Family

non-reviewable situation omitting to point out that most

10

of the appellate law with respect to juvenile delinquency

11

has been made by the progress of these writs up through

12

the courts and that New York takes a relaxed or quite

13

liberal view of the doctrine of capable of repetition, yet

14

evading review, and renders these decisions.
Indeed, the New York Court of Appeals decision

15
16

which upheld this very statute was on a writ.
And, they omit one other thing.

17

In the juvenile

18

case histories that they brought to bear and introduced as

19

evidence, one, Tony Gomez, was released from pre-trial

20

detention by the writ that they suggest to you is not

21

available.

So, there is a thorough going review.

Wouldn't that always be — If

probable cause isn't found, there is a release, isn't

there?

12

MRS. GORDON:

13

QUESTION:

That is correct.

So, really what is going to be

14

reviewed in all these proceedings by a writ is the finding

15

of probable cause, isn't it?

16

MRS. GORDON:

17

QUESTION:

No.

Well, why — I would think by then

18

the probable cause — By the time you can get a writ, the

19

probable cause hearing will go on.

20

MRS. GORDON:

Well, that is exactly what

21

Appellees are saying.

They are saying, well, this is

22

really non-reviewable because the issue of my detention

23

become moot, not necessarily a probable cause but a

24

fact-finding when the child is arguably convicted, which,

25

in New York if you are detained, it proceeds very quickly.

Yes, but the probable cause —

MRS. GORDON:

Yes, Your Honor, but as I was

7

indicating, these are two separate notions, one the Fourth

Amendment notion, and the other the detention standard.

9

The fact that there was probable cause found would not

necessarily mean that the detention was appropriate, that

the pre-trial detention was appropriate.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

upon the first Mathews argument that Appellees advance

2

which goes to this balancing of interest that I was

3

elaborating for the Chief Justice before.
We believe that there are at least — In

4

5

addition to their failure recess the second child

6

protective interest that is involved in the statute, and

7

their failure to note that there is a distinction between

8

a juvenile's interest in pre-trial liberty and an adult's

9

interest in pre-trial liberty.
When Appellees press this analaysis they get to

10
11

a third error which is perhaps the most pervasive.

12

that is since they hypothecate that some group of crimes

13

must be excluded from this prevention detention statute

14

and they characterize them as trival crime, but they never

15

define what kinds of crimes they mean.

16

the state interest and the juvenile's interest in these

17

crimes that are to be excluded is, in fact, a false

18

weighing .

19

And,

Their weighing of

In other words, without knowing what kinds of

20

crimes Appellees have in mind, they never can assess the

21.

importance of the state's interest in including them in a

22

detention standard, nor from the juvenile's interest in

23

pre-trial liberty in excluding them from the standard.

24

So, that when they say that the juvenile's interest

25

outweights the state's interest, they really have not made

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

the requisite comparison or the one that Mathews requires.
In addition, the suggestion that some group of

2
3

crimes should be excluded from the statute turns out to

4

be, on the testimony of their own witness, the

5

criminologist below, to yield a worse statute than the

6

statute that is now on the books.

7

statute because, as their witness testified, the more you

8

qualify crimes, the more you require that somebody predict

9

a specific crime, which you would necessarily have to do

10

It yields a worse

to exclude crime, the worse your prediction becomes.
In other words, your error rate increases with

11
12

every adjective or modification and with every

13

particularization.

predict is the eventuation of crime and not particular

15

crime.

— that under the Fourteenth

I was about to — Let me turn to

that argument and pick up with you and Justice O'Connor.

established that proposition and we adhere to it.

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

The converse proposition that Appellees are

1

2

arguing, namely, that guidelines for decision making, as

3

opposed to the facts and reasons requirement, somehow are

4

the thing that makes the statute constitutional, finds no

5

warrant in the law, and they cite us to no case which says

6

that guidelines, whether administrative or judicially —

7

quasi judicially created in a legislative capacity of a

8

judiciary body, are what make the law constitutional.

9

There is no case like that.
Now, I think if we follow in terms of logic

10
11

exactly what results from guidelines as opposed to from

12

facts and reasons we have to conclude that what the court

13

said in Kent, namely, it is facts and reasons and not

14

guidelines, that that is the appropriate standard.
And, I point out the following:

15

We cited in our

16

opening brief the prefatory nature of guidelines for bail

17

decisions, not the Federal Bail Statute and the New York

18

Bail Statute.

19

all.

20

What is prefatory, Your Honor, seems to me cannot possibly

21

be constitutionally mandated.

22

Appellees don't challenge us on that at

They agree apparently that these are prefatory.

Second, the existence of guidelines in no way

23

translates itself into the decision making process.

24

example, if I were to take the seven general

25

considerations that Judge Quinones testified were common

In other words, the guidelines themselves don't

can result in an error here and there, but certainly that

requirement, the translation of the standard to the

record, is what protects the juvenile from unfettered

discretion.
Indeed, the guidelines allows exactly the same

kind of subjective decision making that Appellees are

arguing against because they don't won't the judge to do

permit a court to detain an individual before trial,

One of the other irrational aspects of this

case — and I could answer this in. another way, Justice

9

Rehnquist, to the Martin and Rosario fact pattern,

10

although I frankly think the case is much broader than

11

that — that juveniles accused of the most serious

12

offenses from 13 to 16 are prosecuted in New York as

13

juvenile offenders in the adult court.

14

preventive detention may not be applied.

15

For them

Similarly, juveniles — Persons 16 to 18, which

16

in most states are juveniles, but not in New York, are not

17

eligible for preventive detention.

18

QUESTION:

Well, the first example may simply

19

vindicate your opponent's view that New York regards its

20

parents' patria role with the children as being involved

21

to a certain extent in the detention.

22

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

I cannot explain the

23

irrationality of the scheme I have just described.

24

the record is plain, from Judge Quinones to every piece of

25

datum in this record, that the purpose of this detention

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

But,

1

is singular.

It is to protect the community from crime in

2

the interim.

That is its only purpose and there is not

3

dispute about that.

4

Now, one of our claims in this case is that it

5

is punishment before trial and I would very briefly like

6

to explain that argument.
This constitutes an affirmative restraint

7

8

imposed by the state for a purpose historically regarded

9

as punishment, incapacitation.

In United States against

10

Brown and Kennedy against Mendoza-Martinez this Court has

11

plainly held that.
This comes into play only because the individual

12
13

is accused of wrongdoing and it is applied to behavior

14

which is already a crime.
The state may not detain individuals before

15
18

trial because of a belief that they will commit a crime in

17

the interim before their conviction.

18

is plain that any exception to the general rule that

19

incarceration follow rather than precede adjudications of

20

guilt can be justified, if at all, by a compelling state

21

interest.

22

justification for the scheme presented by the state is

23

that the facts and reasons requirement of this statute

24

make up for all of the absences of procedural due process

25

protections.

There is none in this case.

But, if they may, it

The only and lame

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

That requirement of facts and reasons was put

2

into this statute by the legislature, as the Attorney

3

General in his brief at page 36 points out, solely so that

4

the legislature could see how the statute was operating.

5

There is no question that there is no meaningful

6

opportunity to review the detention decision made by the

7

judge even with the facts and reasons.

8

QUESTION:

How about habeas?

9

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

Habeas is available as a

10

theoretical remedy, but when a judge has before him or her

11

a case in which the other side, the state, says, Your

12

Honor, the statute says that the court may detain when it
