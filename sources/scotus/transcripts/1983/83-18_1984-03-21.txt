ORAL ARGUMENT OF GORDON LEE GARRETT, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. S-EL-L-ER:

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
The issue before you today is whether the

11
12

First

Amendment's limitations on presumed and punitive

13

damages apply to non-media defendants in actions for

14

defamation.

15

Court to confirm that the First Amendment protects all

16

speech against the award of presumed and punitive

17

damages, absent actual malice.

18

QUESTION;

Petitioner Dun £ Bradstreet has urged the

"Confirm" to me, Mr. Garrett, would

1

suggest that we would be ratifying what someone else has

20

already said is correct.

21

MR. GARRETT;

Who is that someone else?
Fully recognizing, Your Honor,

22

the footnotes in several opinions dealing with private

23

defamation, we believe that this Court's opinion in

24

Gertz versus Pobert Welch leads to the inescapable

25

conclasion that on the one hand the states have no

3

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

substantial interest in awarding presumed and punitive

2

damages against any speech when balanced against the

3

First Amendment protections.

4

word "confirm" is appropriate.
QUESTION*

5

We believe that's why the

I*m not sure I track what you mean

6

when you say private defamation.

7

MR. GARRETT*

8

think

Your Honor, I agree with you.

I

in this Court's opinions "private defamation" has

been used to signify the status of the plaintiff, from a
10

public figure, to a public official, to a private

11

figure.

12

publication to a third party.

But defamation by definition includes a

I think Your Honor is correct that there

13
14

really is no such thing as private defamation.

15

speak

16

referring to a private party, not a public figure or a

17

public official.

of private defamation in this case,

When I

I am really

18

We believe a ruling which would --

1

QUESTION:

I thought perhaps you had it the

20

other way around,

21

private party does not share all the protections that

22

all other persons share under the First Amendment.

23

that there is some concept that a

MR. GARRETT*

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

We

24

believe that the decisions of this Court recognize that

25

the First Amendment is a freedom which is enjoyed by

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

all, and that this Court doesn't make distinctions based

2

on the speaker or his message in connection with

3

defamation cases.

4

We believe that a ruling recognizing that

5

neither presumed nor punitive damages could be allowed,

6

absent actual malice, would do two very important

7

things.

8

and important state interest in protecting the

9

reputational interests of citizens by allowing private

First, it would recognize the very legitimate

10

defamation plaintiffs to recover damages for actual

11

injury.

12

QUESTION:

Well, that isn't the result of any

13

limitation.

That’s the result of the basic state

14

general damage award.

15

MR. GARRETT:

16

QUESTION:

I'm sorry. Justice Rehnquist?

I thought you were saying the

17

reasons why we should have this limitation on the

18

states' authority are two, and one is the state ought to

19

do what it isn't limited to do by this limitation.

20

MR. GARRETT:

No, Your Honor.

My point was

21

that if you recognize the rule which we suggest in our

22

case you would do two different things:

23

recognize that the states have an interest in protecting

24

the reputations of their citizens, and that interest is

25

satisfied by awarding damages for actual injury.

One, you would

5

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

The second point is that it would also

1

2

recognize that, absent actual malice, the states have no

3

interest in awarding either presumed or punitive

4

damages, and that when balanced against the First

5

Amendment freedoms it precludes such an award.

6

Let me emphasize that Dun £ Bradstreet seeks

7

only the same result that would be required in actions

8

brought against newspapers, television, syndicated

9

columnists.

Whatever the term "media" means, we believe

10

that all citizens are entitled to that freedom under the

11

First

12

Amendment.
As I mentioned earlier, we believe that that

13

ruling would flow naturally from the Court's holding in

14

Gertz versus Robert Welch,

15

recognized that the states have no interest in securing

16

for defamation plaintiffs gratuitous awards of money

17

damages far in excess of any actual injury.

18

which significantly

We believe the highlights of the case before

19

the Court recognize the very concerns which troubled

20

this Court in Gertz: jury awards of presumed and

21

punitive damages in wholly unpredictable amounts,

22

bearing no relationship to the actual harm caused.

23

QUESTION:

Well, why are these damage awards

24

so much different than awards in personal injury cases?

25

They're all going up nowadays.

Why shouldn't they gc up

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

against libel defendants, too?

2

SR. GARRETT;

Some of my colleagues at the

3

libel bar would agree with you. Your Honor, that they

4

are going up.

5

the case before the Court, where there was libel per se

6

charged, the jury was instructed that damages are

7

presum ed.

8

There is one fundamental difference.

Other torts do not allow a court to give
presumed damages.

10

13

I should not say "allow.”

States do

not give damages for presumed injury.

11
12

In

QUESTION;

You have to prove the element of

damage ?

SR. GARRETT;

That's correct.

And in an

14

ordinary negligence case, for example, one of the key

15

elements is injury, and that is why.

16

to forget this, too — we are balancing defamation laws

17

against a corresponding First Amendment right, and in

18

ordinary negligence cases there is not even that

1

corresponding First Amendment right except as due

20

process would require.

21

QUESTION;

Plus — and I tend

Your client isn't exactly in the

22

position of the New York Times in New York Times against

23

Sullivan, where the Court talks about the dangers of

24

self-censorship and that sort of thing.

25

great social harm would be done if Dun £ Bradstreet did

2

people's business reputations, would it?
MR. GARRETTi

3

I think, Your Honor, that it’s

of years.

9

£ Bradstreet.

I do not mean to suggest to the

In fact, it's been in business for a number

But I think we must look, Your Honor, at two

10

interests, one in the interest of the free flow of

11

information generally, and secondly the interest in the

12

recipients of Dun £ Bradstreet reports to get prompt,

13

accurate information.

14

And let me be specific.

If Dun £ Bradstreet or any other non-media

15

speaker, whatever that means, is subject to unlimited

16

awards for presumed and punitive damages, I think two

17

things will happen.

18

One, rather than publish something that cannot

19

be triple checked and guaranteed, that information

20

simply will not be published.

21

Bradstreet will oftentimes include in its reports

22

information about how a creditor thinks a particular

23

corporation or proprietorship pays its bills.

24
25

For example, Dun £

Now, when that person that is the subject of
the report calls Dun £ Bradstreet and says, I don’t

440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

agree with you, I was not slow 90 days, and then Dun £

2

Bradstreet calls the creditor to check that information

3

and they say, well, we believe that's correct, but it's

4

in our files, we can't be sure, if Dun £ Bradstreet is

5

subject to unlimited awards, they simply won't publish

6

that.

7

And it's important in the free flow of

8

commercial information that the recipients of those

9

reports know that.

important than making sure someone in the Respondent's

22

position here isn't false accused of having filed

bankru ptcy?

24
25

ME. GARRETT;

I agree, Your Honor, that it is

very important that we recognize the reputational

the appropriate balance when in the Gertz case it says

3

private defamation plaintiffs may be compensated for

4

their actual injury.

And I think the Court struck

In this case, plaintiffs defamed are entitled

5

6

to compensation for actual injury.

7

this case is that the jury was told that damages were

presumed, period.

And I agree with Your Honor that it’s important —
QUESTION*

10

Our problem with

They need not prove actual damages.

But the jury was also told that

11

they had to find malice or lack of good faith to find

12

any damages at all.
MR. GARRETT;

13

That was based, Your Honor, on

14

the Vermont qualified privilege, not on a constitutional

15

standard.

16
17

QUESTION:

What difference does it make?

They

were instructed.

18

QUESTION:

That was the instruction.

19

MR. GARRETT;

Well, the instruction was faulty

20

because it did not define actual malice in the sense of

21

New York Times versus Sullivan.

It was faulty there.

22

QUESTION:

Well,

that would be lesser.

23

QUESTION;

That's the issue in the case.

24

MR. GARRETT:

25

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Justice?

Nothing.

Go ahead.

1

QUESTION;

Well, that's part of the issue in

2

the rase, is what kind of malice you have to show to

3

justify punitive damages.

4

MR. GARRETT;

And we believe that the

5

decisions of this Court correctly recognize that that is

6

constitutional malice in the sense of reckless disregard

7

for the truth or knowledge of falsity.

8
9

10
11

QUESTION;

Was Dun £ Bradstreet requested to

make a retraction and did they do anything about it?
MR. GARRETT;

Yes, sir.

Your Honor, we

believe that —

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. GARRETT;

Did they go the whole way?
Oh, yes.

We believe the record

14

reflects this;

15

special notice which caused — which set forth that

16

Greenness Builders had filed a petition in bankruptcy,

17

that when the President of Greenmoss called Dun £

18

Bradstreet, on that very day they issued a correction in

19

the form of a -- excuse me, a retraction, in the form of

20

a correction notice.

21

that promptly after the issuance of the

QUESTION ;

Did Dun £ Bradstreet let them know

22

who were the recipients of the original false

23

inf orn ation ?

24
25

MR. GARRETT;

At that time, Your Honor, I do

not believe that Dun £ Bradstreet did.

That's correct, although they

6

That is clear from

7

improper for a jury to infer malice from their refusal

to let

WE. GARRETT;

I don't believe so under this

11

Court's constitutional standard dealing with focusing on

12

the speaker's mind at the time of the publication.

13

would go to something after the publication was done.

14

As I was indicating --

15

QUESTION;

16

This

Mr. Garrett, as long as you're

interrupted, may I ask you another question?

17

MR. GARRETT:

18

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

There are federal laws in the

19

securities fields, such as Section 10(b)(5), that govern

20

statements that are made in connection with the sale of

21

securities.

22

right for people who are publishing information about

23

securities that has to be considered every time we have

24

a 10(b)(5) action?

25

Do you think there's a First Amendment

MR. GARRETT;

Your Honor, I think that would

12

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

require a different analysis than we have in the

2

defamation area.

3

be talking about individuals publishing matters who are

4

subject to the control of the SEC, as being licensed,

5

perhaps.

6

As I understand the question, we would

I think that in restraining those types of

7

publications there is a much different focus.

8

cases,

9

of the report rather than the individual identified in

10
11

In those

I believe the Court is focusing on the recipient

the report in defamation cases.
QUESTION:

Well,

And I think —

but you’re asking us to

12

recognize a First Amendment right here in connection

13

with the Dun Z. Bradstreet type of publication, and I'm

14

just wondering if that wouldn’t lead us to having to

15

recognize First Amendment rights in a 10(b)(5) situation

16

or an ordinary fraud situation, anything?

17

HR. GARRETT:

I do not believe so, Your Honor,

18

because what we are talking here about is the sole issue

19

of speech in context of defamation, not speech in the

20

context of giving advisor’s advice to the SEC.

21

indicated, I believe a totally different analysis would

22

apply there.

And as I

23

What we are asking the Court to recognize is

24

that the First Amendment protects all speakers against

25

these types of awards, and

we do not believe that the

13
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

stats interest varies in securing gratuitous awards of

2

money damages for plaintiffs depending on the speaker or

3

the message.
QUESTION:

4

Nr. Garrett, may I ask you a

5

question right there?

You seem to treat the case as

and non-media speakers.

You’re in the non-media
But yet, in the

instructions to the jury you got a special instruction
10

for the privilege for credit reporting agencies, which

11

kind of suggests maybe you’re in a special narrow

12

category.

13

a narrow category and you don’t get all the benefits of

14

other non-media people.

15

Up here your opponent argues, yes, you’re in

Would you kind cf comment on how much you

16

think you're typical of non-media defendants generally?

17

You see, they also say this is commercial speech and

18

it’s not something distributed at large, that you don’t

1

need robust debate on whether somebody went into

20

bankruptcy or not.

21

specialized area.

22

It’s kind of a different,

NR. GARRETT:

Your Honor, I must admit that I

23

have a great deal of difficulty in deciding what is

24

"media" and what is non-media.

1

Do you suggest that there was no

2

evidence?

3

that there was no evidence to support?

4

Did you suggest that before you got here,

MR, GARRETT*

Your Honor, we believe that the

5

evidence showed that plaintiff had not called any

6

recipient of the report to prove that there was a causal

7

connection between the issuance of the report, its

8

receipt, and any damage by Greenmoss.

9

there was no evidence introduced at this trial by anyone

10

establishing a causal connection between the publication
of the

12
3

And in fact,

special notice and the company’s alleged injury

and damage.
What we believe this exorbitant verdict

4

resulted from were jury instructions which gave the jury

5

uncontrolled discretion to assess unlimited amounts of

6

damages without regard to actual injury and without

7

regard to Dun £ Bradstreet's state of mind.

They defined "malice" in the state law privilege, and

No, sir.

My recollection of

what happened at the trial court was that defendant’s

MR. GARRETT;

to was an instruction that your client was not to be

19

was true or false?
MR. GARRETT;

20

No, Justice Brennan.

All we

I'm still lost.

You said

the plaintiff had to prove actual damage.

QUESTION:

7

HR. GARRETT:

Well, that's Gertz, isn't it?
Yes.

We are arguing. Your

8

Honor,

that the Gertz standard for private plaintiffs

9

should have been applied in this case to Dun £

10

Bradstreet, and the jury should not have been allowed to

award presumed damages.

3

Well, their theory, as I understood

4

it, their theory of malice emphasized, their arguments

reason for making you pay a heavy damage award.
MR. GARRETT;

7

That is correct, and we do not

believe that the First Amendment would protect that —

9

would

allow that.

What we do say --

QUESTION;

10

Well, why wouldn’t the First

11

Amendment allow that?

Because I can see how that would

12

be quite important to a businessman, to go around and

13

straighten out his reputation with all these people.
MR. GARRETT;

14

Because the First Amendment in

15

the defamation area we believe focuses on the

defendant's state of mind when the publication was

17

made.

But does that immunize?

If two

-- as to whether Gertz applies.
In this case# we don't think

this case is about is credit reports, and we think that

This case does not present the difficult

I think common sense is the first test that

MR. HEILMANNs

Because under the commercial

commercial speech and the large body of precedent in the

10

the law about commercial speech and the movement toward

limiting it to advertising, would it make sense to try

MR. HEILMANN;

Even apart from the commercial speech question

in this case, I think the type of speech that’s involved

raises a very fundamental reason why the Gertz doctrine

is inapplicable.

thing.

4

presumed damages is that the intuition of common

experience as it has found its way in the common law

through centuries of defamation precedent counseled that

it*s certain that the harm proved is causally related to

the defamation when those two things coexist in time.

And I think that's really the function that

the states have here.

Bear in mini what Dun G

11

Bradstreet is asking this Court to do is to say that the

Now, I think there is another role or another

state interest that states have in defamation, and that

is the interest, as the Vermont Supreme Court pointed

out, in the difference between an individual who lives

common law punitive damage charge just to get to the

7

question of any compensatory damage, and then common law

malice to think about and focus upon the other activity

that this defendant engaged in.
So you would have four separate things for the

jury to handle.

I think that would just hopelessly

12

confuse a jury.

There's been a lot of commentary about

13

the difficulty between actual malice and common law

14

malice and constitutional malice, and essentially what

15

they're asking the Court to do is to have a trial where

16

there are those four instructions.

I think the difficulty that

And I think the difficulties here with Gertz

show that the decision was very carefully framed in both

rationale, philosophy, and language to deal with a

specific type of defendant.

13

My final point is this.

I mentioned earlier

14

that if this case is extended, if Gertz is extended to

15

this type of a defendant, what we will have is the total

constitutionalization of the state laws of libel.

think we really have to ask ourselves whether that's
