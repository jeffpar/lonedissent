ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GEL1ER, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

9

This case was brought by Respondent Mendoza in

10

1978 in an effort to become a naturalized American

11

citizen.

12

entitled to naturalization under any provision of the

13

immigration laws that are now in effect.

14

undisputed that the Immigration and Nationality Act

15

expressly provides that an alien may not be naturalized

16

under any expired provision of law.

It's undisputed that Respondent is not

It's also

;

17

Now, despite these seemingly insurmountable

18

barriers to Respondent's naturalization, the district

19

court granted that relief and the Court of Appeals

20 affirmed.
21

The lower courts held that the United States

was collaterally estopped to oppose Respondent's

22 naturalization because the constitutional argument
23

presented by Respondent in support of his claim for

24

citizenship had been decided adversely to the United

25

States in a prior district court case involving other

unrelated aliens.

2

challenge this unprecedented and we believe quite

3

destructive application of collateral estoppel on an

4

issue of law.

5

And we’ve sought certiorari to

Now, the Court is familiar with the background

6

of this case because it confronted essentially an

7

identical situation in INS versus Hibi, which was

8

decided in 1973.

9

occurred in the Philippines during the end of World War

10

The case relates to events that

Two .
Briefly, in 1942 Congress passed the Second

11
12

War Powers Act.

13

for aliens serving honorably in the United States Armed

14

Forces to become American citizens, and Section 702 cf

15

that Act provided for the overseas naturalization of

16

aliens who are eligible for citizenship under Section

17

701 .

18

Section 701 of that Act made it easier

Now, naturalizations under Section 702

19

obviously were not possible in the Philippines until

20

1945, when the Japanese occupation ended.

21

1945 the INS sent a designated naturalization examiner

22

to the Philippines tc begin performing naturalizations

under Section 701 and 702.

Did the Act require the United

States to send examiners outside the continental limits

Section 702 contemplated that

naturalizations would take place overseas.
QUESTION;

4

And you maintain that it was

5

required that the United States do that under the Act,

6

not permitted but required?
MR. GELLERi

7

les, although Section 705 of the

8

Act gave the Attorney General tremendous discretion in

9

how to implement the Act, and this Court held that in

10

Hibi.
Almost immediately upon the designated

11
12

naturalization examiner's arrival in the Philippines in

13

August

14

concerned that a large number of young Filipino men,

15

perhaps as many as 250,000, would seek to become

16

American citizens under this provision and leave for the

17

United

which was then scheduled for July 1946.

19

1945, the Philippine Government objected.

It was

States on the even of Philippine independence,

In response to this diplomatic complaint.

20

Attorney General Tom Clarke, in consultation with the

21

INS and the Department of State, revoked the authority

22

of the naturalization examiner under Section 701 and 702

23

and naturalization ceased in the Philippines under these

24

provisions around the end of October 1945.

25

The authority of the naturalization examiner

was reinstated nine months later in August of 1946 and

2

naturalizations began once again in the Philippines and

3

continued until December 1946, when Sections 701 and 702

4

expired by their own terms.

6

Now, Hibi, as the Court will recall, was a

6

case brought by a Filipino veteran who did not seek

7

naturalization under Section 701 and 702 until 1967, 20

8

years after those provisions had expired.

9

claimed that the United States was equitably estopped

10

from relying on the expiration date of those statutes

11

because of the Government's failure to station a

12

naturalization examiner in the Philippines for the

13

nine-month period between October 1945 and August 1946.

14

But Hibi

The Ninth Circuit agreed with that argument

15

and held that the United States was equitably estopped.

16

But this Court summarily reversed.

17

the Federal Government could not be estopped from

18

enforcing the immigration laws passed by Congress,

19

except perhaps if it had engaged in some affirmative

20

Government misconduct.

21

the Government had not engaged in any affirmative

22

misconduct in the way it had administered Section 701

23

and 702 in the Philippines, including by not having a

24

naturalization examiner there for the nine-month period

25

that's crucial to these cases.

The Court held that

Not long after Hibi was decided, a new group

2

of Filipino veterans brought suit to try to obtain

3

American citizenship under Sections 701 and 702.

General Clarke’s actions in

naturalization examiner for nine months did not

3

constitute affirmative Government misconduct, the

4

district court in 68 Filipinos held that this very same

5

conduct constituted a violation of the due process

6

clause, and the court therefore ordered the Government

7

to grant citizenship to the Filipino plaintiffs in that

8

case as a remedy for the due process violation.
It’s important to mention at this point that

9

10

withdrawing this

68 Filipinos was not a class action.
The Government took an appeal in 68 Filipinos

11

and it filed its brief in the Court of Appeals.

case had been correctly decided, but he suggested that

19

it would be in keeping with the immigration policies of

20

the new Administration to withdraw the appeal in that

21

case and let those 68 Filipinos become citizens pursuant

22

to the district court’s order.

There was substantial disagreement within the

24

Justice Department as to this recommendation, but

25

ultimately the appeal in 68 Filipinos was withdrawn in

1

November 1977.

Now, almost immediately after the

2

decision was made to withdraw the appeal the Justice

3

Department began to reassess whether it had acted

4

wisely.

5

Commissioner of Immigration had been summoned to Capitol

6

Hill to explain the reasons why the Government had

7

decided to drop the appeal in the 68 Filipinos case,

8

even though the district court’s decision seemed to be

9

inconsistent with Hibi.

In part, this was due to the fact that the

10

The upshot of the Government’s reassessment

11

was that in April 1978 the Justice Department decided

12

that henceforth it would continue to oppose the

13

naturalization of Filipino veterans who. A, were not

14

eligible for citizenship under current law, and who, B,

15

had made no attempt to apply for citizenship under

16

Section 701 and 702 during the period of time that those

17

laws were in effect back in

18

1945 and 1946.

category of Filipinos.

Now, later on when it was decided to reinstate the

to a number of preferences under the immigration laws.
We have argued, we argued in the lower courts,

3

that in part the decision tc reinstate the Government’s

4

position in April *78 was due to a reassessment of the

5

number of Filipino veterans who would be subject to

6

these laws.

7

the reassessment was based on the conclusion that it had

8

been unwise as a matter of law to drop the appeal.

But in part I think it’s fair to say that

QUESTIONS

I wasn’t questioning the wisdom of

the Government’s decision.

11

MR. GELLERs

12

QUESTIONS

Yes.
I was just curious if we Knew, as

13

between category one and category two, what the relative

14

sizes of the categories were.

15

MR. GELLERs

Oh, category two is much, much

16

larger than category one.

There are very, very few

17

people who fall into category one, a handful of people.

18

Now, as I said, the Respondent Mendoza is a

19

member of this group, category two in Judge Renfrew’s

20

terminology.

21

the Government opposed because he is not eligible for

22

citizenship under the current law and because he had

23

never made any attempt to apply for citizenship in 1945

24

and 1946 when the Sections 701 and 702 were in effect.

25

When he applied for citizenship in

1978,

But the district court treated this case as

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

simply a routine application of offensive non-mutual

plainly wrong on a number of different levels.

If we

10

approach the case simply as a technical legal matter, it

11

seems clear that the Ninth Circuit simply misapplied

12

black-letter principles of estoppel law.
The Court of Appeals simply relied on this

13
14

Court’s decision in Parklane Hosiery, without realizing

15

that Parklane really just talked about collateral

16

estoppel on an issue of fact.

17

have always been applied to preclusion on issues of

18

law .

19

Different considerations

The settled rule as set forth in this Court’s

20

cases, such as Moser, Montana, and as explained in the

21

various Restatements of Judgments, is that estoppel on a

22

pure or unmixed question of law is never appropriate

23

unless, at a minimum, there are the same parties to the

24

two lawsuits and the two lawsuits involve the same

26

so-called ’’demand", to use the Moser and Montana

12

1

terminology.
Now, those requirements were plainly net met

2
3

here because Mendoza was not a party to the 68 Filipinos

4

litigation and by no stretch of the language can

5

Respondent Mendoza's demand

6

considered the same demand as the naturalization claims

7

of the unrelated aliens in the 68 Filipinos case.

Mr. Geller, when you use the term

"collateral estoppel" you mean the doctrine that goes
beyond res judicata.

11

MR. GELIERs

12

QUESTION!

Yes, issue preclusion.
Issue preclusion.

But now, if one

13

reads the Montana decision of this Court as being a

14

holding that the Government was in privity the first

15

time,

16

as between the same two parties because it's a different

17

lawsuit?

18

now, that would be collateral estoppel but still

MR. GELLERj

Yes, although in Montana the

19

Court essentially said, using the Moser terminology,

20

that the two lawsuits involved the same demand.

21

think Montana is a correct application of the legal

22

principles we're relying on here, because the two

23

lawsuits in Montana involved the same parties and

24

involved the same demand, whereas here neither

25

requirement is met.

3

QUESTION!

Well then, why wasn’t it res

judicata in Montana, if you're right?

4

MR. GELLERi

I think, it was in a sense res

5

judicata.

The only reason it wasn’t technically res

6

judicata is because there were slightly different

7

contracts involved.

8

action, and I think that's the difference between issue

9

preclusion involving the same demand and res judicata.

It wasn’t really the same cause of

10

Ees judicata requires that it be the same precise cause

11

of action.

12

What was decided in 68 Filipinos was that

13

those discrete plaintiffs had had their due process

14

rights violated by what the Attorney General had done in

15

1945 and 1946.

16

That was the distinct fact question —

QUESTION!

Well, when you refer to that, what

17

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

irrelevant whether somebody else's due process rights

2

were violated in Respondent Mendoza's case.

3

Mendoza has to show that some Government action violated

4

his rights and that he is entitled as a result to the

relief of citizenship.

Respondent

6

Sow, that fact question or right# whether

7

Respondent Mendoza's has had his due process rights

8

violated and whether he's entitled to the remedy of

9

citizenship, was never distinctly adjudged in the 68

10

Filipinos litigation, nor could it have been because he
wasn’t even a party to that litigation.
There are, we believe, strong practical and

2
3

policy reasons why the strict and traditional

4

restrictions on the collateral estoppel doctrine as

5

applied to issues of law should be strictly adhered to.

6

Collateral estoppel, of course, is an equitable

doctrine.

doctrine should not be applied where it would not be in

unfair or unjust.

HR. GELLEBs

No, I don’t believe so, Justice

7

O’Connor.

8

relying on here are fully consistent with the Court’s

9

decision in Hontana, because in Montana there was an

10

identity of parties between the first and the second

MR. GELLER*

Well, the Government did argue

17

for a different result in Montana, Justice White.

18

The principal reason for the collateral

19

estoppel doctrine, as the Court has mentioned in

Parklane, I think we all agree, is to prevent needless

21

relitigation, needless relitigation.

But when we're dealing with a legal issue, and

constitutional dimensions as we are in this case, it's

really hard to conclude that relitigation in cases

In fact, I think it’s fair to say that this

Court particularly would be ill served if it regularly

had to decide legal issues without the benefit of

divergent lower court opinions, which often serve to

highlight or sharpen the legal issues.

Now, perhaps the Ninth Circuit’s rule, if

applied to private parties, wouldn’t be all that

harmful, because most private parties don’t litigate a

legal issue more than once, and most private litigants

25

don't forego an appeal when they think their legal

arguments are sound.

But we think that the Ninth

2

Circuit’s rule would have a devastating effect on the

3

conduct of institutional litigants, and particularly the

4

Federal Government.
The Federal Government is constantly involved

5

6

in litigating legal issues on a nationwide basis.

In

7

fact, many legal issues, such as the immigration issues

8

in this case and most constitutional issues, really only

9

can arise in Government litigation.

And if the

10

Government were compelled to abide by the first decision

11

adverse to its position, we submit it would have a

12

number of unfortunate results.

13

For one thing, the Government would have to

14

abandon its traditional, and we think quite salutary,

policy of carefully screening the cases it takes on

appeal, and particularly the cases it takes to this

QUESTION:

1

Do you think the Ninth Circuit rule

2

applies to when the Solicitor General confesses error?

3

I hope it doesn't apply to that.

4

MR. GELLER:

I would think that it would; if

the Government has announced its legal position in the

6

course of litigating a case and that works its way into

7

a court judgment, that the Government would, be bound.
QUESTION:

8

9

It'd be barred from forever raising

that point?
MR. GELLER;

10

That is a permissible reading of

11

the Ninth Circuit’s position, and that's what has us

12

troubled.

13

There are other harmful consequences as well,

14

I think, that flow from the Ninth Circuit's ruling.

If

15

the Government were allowed only one legal bite at any

18

legal issue, it would tend to petrify or freeze the law

17

quite unnaturally and often quite unfairly.

18

pointed out in Standefer that litigation over public

19

rights stand on a decidedly different footing than

20

private litigation when it comes to applications of the

21

preclusion doctrine.

This Court

22

Preclusion on a legal issue might prevent the

23

Government from bringing or defending some lawsuit that

24

we would all agree would be in the public interest.

25

fact, I suppose the Ninth Circuit's rule would allow one

In

Administration to bind a future Administration on an

2

issue of constitutional law or statutory construction,

3

simply by not appealing some adverse decision.

4

It would also prevent the Government from

5

changing policies over time in response to changes in

6

outlook or experience, and this case is in many ways a

7

textbook example of what I*m talking about, because the

8

decision to drop the appeal in 68 Filipinos and then the

9

decision to reconsider that decision and to begin — and

10

to enforce the immigration laws in a particular way, is

11

the sort of constant reassessment of administrative and

12

legal positions, enforcement positions, that the

13

Government frequently undertakes, and that we would all

14

agree the Government should be encouraged to undertake

15

in a democratic society.

16

Now, in a sense perhaps I've been a trifle

17

unfair in describing the Ninth Circuit’s rule, because

18

to be fair the Court of Appeals did say that there may

19

be certain circumstances where it would not be

appropriate to collaterally estop the Government on an

Now, I just want to add one more word about

11

12

the Ninth Circuit’s collateral estoppel ruling in this

13

case.

14

everything I’ve said up until now, we think it would

15

still have to reverse the Court of Appeals because the

16

Ninth Circuit has precluded the Government from

17

litigating not only issues that were raised and decided

18

in the 68 Filipinos case, but also a number of quite

19

significant legal issues that were never litigated in 68

20

Filipinos.

21

Even if the Court were to disagree with

Even as applied to an issue of fact,

22

collateral estoppel has never been taken that far.

23

think the Ninth Circuit confused collateral estoppel

24

with res judicata.

6

occurred, a court has the power to order citizenship as

7

a remedy.

in 68

I do want to mention one specifically because
\

9

I think it particularly shows the unfairness of the

10

application of collateral estoppel in this case.

11

if the Government were precluded from challenging the

12

due process holding in the 68 Filipinos case, there

13

would still be a substantial question as to whether this

14

Respondent is entitled to the relief that the 68

15

Filipinos plaintiffs received, because the 68 Filipinos

16

plaintiffs had all been in the Philippines during the

17

nine-month period that the naturalization examiner was

18

absent, whereas Respondent Kendoza was in the United

19

States for six of those months and could easily have

20

applied for citizenship under Section 701 simply by

21

going into any United States district court.

22

Even

So it’s very hard to understand why, at the

very least, the Government is estopped from litigating

whether this Respondent is entitled to the substantial

QUESTION*

is being given an opportunity to litigate.

21

MR. UNGARs

I thought that

But certainly your client

Sure he is.

He's given an

22

opportunity to litigate that question.

But I’m a little

23

puzzled about the argument about the identity of parties

24

that Mr. Geller has raised, because if he’s insisting

25

that collateral estoppel will not apply unless there is

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

an identity of parties, then it seems to me he would

2

revert back, to the mutuality rule, which this Court

3

abandoned in Parklane and the Blonder-Tongue cases.

4

And unless that happens, if you're going to

5

insist on identity of parties, it would be difficult to

6

conceive of a situation where another opponent can come

7

in and raise the doctrine of offensive collateral

8

estoppel as Dr. Mendoza wishes to do in this situation.

9

QUESTION;

Well, my only point was that when

10

you do depart from mutuality I don't think you have the

11

same fairness argument that you have in -- you have

12

basically a judicial economy argument.

13

unfair to Dr. Mendoza to require him to litigate his

14

claim once, is it?

15

MR. UNGAR;

I mean, it's not

Well, I think it's unfair for the

16

Government to have one policy with respect to certain

17

veterans and to say, okay, you people can be

18

naturalized, and to take people like Dr. Mendoza and to

19

say, sorry, you can't be naturalized, although the

20

circumstances are virtually identical.

do think there's a fairness argument to be made.

think that we should apply the same policy when the

Government is a party as between private litigants?
MR. UNGAR:

the

12

least it could do would be to come forward with evidence

13

or a showing that there really is some significant

15

different.

decision would impinge upon the President’s powers and

how it would impinge upon the power of Congress to

provide a uniform rule of naturalization.

But it should

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

be obvious that Judge Renfrew's decision in this case is

going to be limited by the extraordinary facts of this

It* a really extraordinary set of

circum stances, because this circumstance is simply not

going to happen again, realistically.

talking about a recurring national — a recurring issue

of national significance.

9

facts are not going to recur?

The Government is

How can that be when the
It seems to me that in

10

any future litigation Judge Renfrew's decision can

11

easily be distinguished on the facts.

12

I think the same is true about the

13

Government's argument that somehow Judge Renfrew's

14

decision stands for the proposition that courts may

15

impinge upon the Congressional power to provide a rule

16

of naturalization.

17

decision really stands for, and of course it really

18

amazes me that the Government would come in here with

19

that sort of argument when it thwarted the will of

20

Congress itself back in 1945 when it refused to let

21

these people be naturalized who should have been

22

naturalized under that law.

23

That's not what Judge Renfrew's

But Judge Renfrew's decision in any event

24

doesn't stand for that proposition.

All it stands fcr

25

is the proposition that when a person has been denied an

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

opportunity to apply for naturalization under a law that

2

Congress provided for that person's benefit and that

3

denial amounts to a denial of due process, then no

4

statute can stand as a bar to his naturalization

5

anyway .
So it seems to me the Government has failed

8

7

totally in coming before this Court and establishing

8

that there really is an issue that would be of recurring

9

national significance.

And it seems to me that if the

10

Government is to be treated as different from private

11

litigants, it has to be treated that way because of the

12

public interest that it represents.

13

forward with a real public interest argument, then why

14

not apply collateral estoppel to the Government?

In effect, he was in identical

QUESTION*

That’s what you’re saying.

10

MR. UNGAR*

Yes, that’s what I’m saying.

11

Let me turn for a moment to the other argument

12

that Mr. Geller is making here, and that is that if Er.

13

Mendoza is naturalized the Government somehow is going

14

to have to flood the courts with unnecessary appeals.

15

Well, I think that that argument is as exaggerated as

16

the argument the Government has made about the numbers

17

of people who would apply when they were arguing the

18

Hibi case and when they were arguing 68 veterans.

19

It's difficult for me to belief that if Dr.

20

Mendoza is naturalized as an American citizen, somehow

21

the Solicitor General of the United States is going to

22

be unable to recognize what cases to appeal and what

23

cases not to appeal. ' In fact, the considerations that

24

he says himself he takes into account in deciding

25

whether to appeal or not would be similar to those

44

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

issues he would have to take into account in deciding

2

whether there’s a danger of estoppel if an appeal is not

3

For example, the significance of the issues,

the foreseeability of future litigation, whether the

6

stakes in the two cases were virtually the same, or

7

whether there’s some overriding public interest

8

involved.

9

that this Court held in Parklane were the kinds of

Those are the same considerations, of course,

10

considerations that the trial court should take into

11

account in the application of offensive collateral

12

estoppel.

13

In response to what Justice O’Connor

14

requested, it seems to me it’s difficult also to think

15

of situations where the Government is going to be

16

estopped very often, as a matter of fact, because they

17

will have the public interest.

18

they have not established a public interest in the

19

circumstances of this particular case.

20

QUESTION*

My point is simply that

Well, maybe the interest is the

21

concern that some might have with the use of — the

22

application of offensive collateral estoppel as a

23

principle against the Government.

24

Court of Appeals certainly clearly stands for that, and

25

perhaps that motivates a re-examination.

too •
I think I'd like to turn for a moment to the

4
5

argument that Mr. Geller made with respect to the Moser

6

exception that's discussed in the Montana case in this

7

matter of not only identity of parties, but the

8

applicability of that Moser exception to unmixed

9

questions of law that are based upon a different

10
11

demand.
In my opinion, Moser — that Moser exception

12

really ought to be interpreted, as I think the Court

13

interpreted it in Montana, in light of the purpose and

14

objectives of that particular exception or that

15

particular rule.

16

objective of that particular rule was simply that a rule

17

of law should not be applied to facts and circumstances

18

that are different, significantly different from facts

19

and circumstances that led to adoption of the rule in

20

the first place.

21

And it seems to me the purpose and

If that were the case, then constitutional

22

doctrine would be frozen, development of the law would

23

be hindered, because the law couldn't adapt to changing

24

times and changing circumstances.

25

there's no danger of freezing the law in this particular

But in my opinion

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

case when the facts are identical, and if the facts are

2

identical or substantially identical in time and subject

3

matter there really isn’t this danger that the Court was

4

talking about in Moser and Montana.
Certainly that’s no danger in the

5
6

circumstances of this case, when the factual — the

7

historical facts that gave rise to the rule of law by

8

Judge Renfrew in his opinion, those historical facts are

9

really identical, and there’s no danger that the Court

10

was concerned about in Moser and Montana of freezing

11

constitutional doctrine.
That’s all I meant when I said in our brief

12

13

that this term "different demand" that's used in Moser

14

doesn’t mean that a demand is different simply because

15

another litigant comes along.

16

were the case then the Moser exception is never going to

17

apply, because there’s always going to be a different

18

party coming along.

It seems to me if that

It seems to me a demand is different when the

19
20

historical facts of the second case are substantially

21

different, are substantially unrelated from the facts of

22

the first case, because if they are that would thwart

23

the purpose or objective of the rule in the first

24

place.

25

then it seems to me that objective is satisfied.

Put when they’re not substantially unrelated,

I think as long as I have a moment or two

left, I would like tc mention just one or two other

3

points with respect to the Hibi case on the issue here.

4

It seems to me what we're talking about here is issue

5

preclusion, and the due process issue that was raised in

6

68 veterans and in Dr. Mendoza's case was not an issue

7

that was addressed by the Court in Hibi.
Obviously, the facts were pretty much the

8
9

same.

But the fact that the facts were the same doesn’t

10

mean that the issue was the same.

11

was addressed by the Court was the equitable estoppel

12

issue and not the due process issue.

13

The only issue that

And I think it's interesting to note what this

14

Court said about Hibi in the Miranda case, which is

15

cited in the Government's brief, INS versus Miranda.

16

INS versus Miranda, this Court recognized that what the

17

Government did here was an error, a clear error,

18

failing to allow the naturalization examiner to carry

19

out his duty in the Philippines in 1945.

20

Court didn't feel that that error rose to the level cf

21

affirmative misconduct which would trigger the

22

application of equitable estoppel.
