How do we know all this?

MR. RUBENSTONE:

These facts, Your Honor, did

not come out during the course of the District Court

They are set forth in the brief to this Court.

QUESTION:

The clients profess

I understand, but I do not think --

8

You must assume the possibility that there is seme

evidence of guilt that will surface sooner or later.

10

HR. PUBENSTOHE:

No, I must assume the

11

possibility with all due respect that there may be

evidence which the government believes demonstrates

13

wrongdoing, but I need not assume that there will be

evidence of guilt nor need

I assume in making my

In this entire proceeding I think it is

19

important to note since the time of the Pule 44

20

disqualification hearing right up to today there has

21

been not one shred of evidence, not one piece of

22

information presented by the government which gives any

23

claim to any assertion that they might make that there

24

is anything inconsistent as between the stories which

25

the defendants tell.

QUESTION*

At some time are you going to

2

discuss the question of whether this order was

3

appeal able?
MR. RUBENSTONEs

4
5

that right now.

6

QUESTION s

7

MR. RUBENSTONEi

8

9

I would be happy to discuss

At your own time.
Let me turn to it very

quickly.
The decision to disqualify counsel is a final

10

and irrevocable decision.

11

intense impact upon the trial.

12

It has an immediate and an

It has an immediate and intense impact upon

13

the defendants and every action which they take during

14

the entire course of the trial, and it destroys

15

ultimately and utterly the defendants* right to counsel

16

at the most critical stage cf his life.

17

As a result to use the language of Cohen, the

18

decision to disqualify counsel is too important and too

19

independent to defer review.

20

specific test which was laid out in Cohen and in Cooper

21

I think it is clear that of the three-prong test fcr

22

appealability as a collateral order the disqualification

23

of counsel decision meets the first two.

24
25

Now if we turn to the

It is a decision which conclusively determines
the question, and it is a decision which is totally

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

separate and apart from any question involving the guilt

2

or innocence of the defendant.

3

think

4

whether or not the decision to disqualify counsel is

5

effectively reviewable.

6

The only area which I

does raise some discussion is the question of

Seven circuits have passed on this issue both

7

in the criminal and in the civil context, and each of

8

them has rejected the argument that such a decision is

9

effectively reviewable.

Basically every court including

10

the Ninth Circuit which has said that this is not an

11

order which is appealable in an interlocutory fashion

12

has said any attempt to prove prejudice by a defendant

13

who has his counsel denied to him at the inception of

14

the case would be an insurmountable burden and we cannot

15

imagine any way that he could go about showing that,

16

meeting that burden.

17

QUESTIONi

Well, I suppose if some per se

18

reversal rule were adopted you would not have

19

dif fic ulty.

20

KB. RUBENSTONEt

That is what the Ninth

21

Circuit said in Greger, Justice O’Connor, and I do have

22

a difficulty with per se reversal because there is too

23

much which can occur during the course of a trial which

24

is not reversable.

25

during the course of a trial which is irremediable and

There is too much that can occur

1

which is denied to a defendant if he is forced to go to

2

trial

with counsel other than his choice.

3

For example, at a trial, the first trial, a

4

lot of people are going to testify.

5

counsel may be competent, but he may not be the counsel

6

that the defendant -selects, and his ability to direct or

7

cross examine that witness may not be the same level as

8

the ability of counsel of choice.

Now subsitute

9

Likewise the strategy or the tactics which he

10

might adopt in cross examining or direct examining that

11

witness may have been different and may have been

12

injurious to the interests of that defendant.

13

that witness is subsequently unavailable his testimony

14

is admissible in the event of a retrial, and I submit

15

that that is prejudice.

Now if

The very decision as to whether or not the

16
17

defendant will testify may be made one way by counsel of

18

choice, may be made the exact opposite way by substitute

19

counsel.

20

on the stand and have him testify then his testimony is

21

going to be forever etched in stone, and that will not

22

be reversable.

If substitute counsel decides to put that man

QUESTION*

Nr. Rubenstone, the Cobbledick case

24

says that the policy especially in criminal cases is

25

against piecemeal appeals, and

there is no doubt that an

2

conceivably here if certiorari is granted does delay the

3

start of the criminal trial.

4

MR. ROBEKSTOHEs

Yes, especially if, as has

5

occurred in this case, the District Court entered a

6

stay.

7

automatic stay as a result of an appeal under 1291.

I do not think that there is necessarily an

8

Somebody has got to stay the proceedings, and

9

I think that at that point there is a certain degree of

10

discretion in both the district court and the court of

11

appeals as to whether cr not this is a matter which does

12

require review or whether this is a matter which is

13

frivolous.

14

all the time.

We do it in the double jeopardy situation

QUESTION;

15

Mr. Rubenstone, are there any cases

16

to your knowledge in which a Faretta situation if a

17

defendant is denied the opportunity to represent himself

18

for whatever reason that that has been held to be

19

immediately appealable on an interlocutory basis?
MR. RUBEKSTONEs

20
21

Honor,

I am not aware of any, Your

but I would imagine that if a state —

22

QUESTION;

Would that be a similar situation?

23

MR. RUBENSTONE:

I would think so.

I mean if

24

the state or federal government would refuse to provide

25

counsel to an indigent in connection with his criminal

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

defense I would imagine —

2

QUESTION*

No, well let's say he wanted to

3

represent himself and for whatever reason the court

4

determined, for instance, he was not capable of doing it

5

and appointed counsel and the defendant insisted on an

6

interlocutory appeal on that guestion.
PR. RUBENSTONE:

7

Well, what I am saying is

8

really just the flip side of the Gideon situation where

9

the government does not comply with Gideon.

This Court

10

has found that there is a constitutional right and that

11

that right cannot be impinged upon absent extreme

12

circumstances.

13

right to take the appeal, but I am aware of no cases

14

that have raised that issue.

So I think, there would be absolutely a

15

QUESTION*

But you have found no case?

16

MR. RUBENSTONEs

17

QUESTION*

No.

Put your suggestion in response to

18

Justice O'Connor that if there is a constitutional right

19

involved there must be a right to an interlocutory

20

appeal certainly is not supported by our cases.
MR. RUBENSTONE*

21

Ho.

I do not mean to suggest

22

that at all.

I believe, and maybe I made an improper

23

assumption, but I believe that the denial of the right

24

to represent one's self following the Faretta decision

25

would

have the same effect and would meet the same

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

criteria as are set down in Cohen and as this Court has

2

accepted for an interlocutory appeal.
So I think it would be appealable under 1291.

3
4

I do not mean to suggest that just because there is a

5

constitutional right that there is automatically a right

6

to appeal.
QUESTIONi

7

You do not think one of the

8

criteria for immediate appeal is that the issue would

9

not otherwise be reviewable?

MB. RUBENSTONE;

Absolutely.

Indeed the

government's position in this issue is that you do not

really even look at the question of whether there has

QUESTION;

Well, you were speaking of it as

though it was a right to choose.

6

MR. RUBENSTONE;

It is a right to choose.

is a right to choose who you want whether you are a

millionaire or an indigent.

9

The fact is that it takes two to tango.

It

Ihe

10

fact is that if an indigent goes up to Edward Bennett

Williams who charges I have no idea for his services,

12

but if he can convice Edward Bennett Williams that his

13

case is interesting enough and important enough Mr.

14

Williams may take the case.
So I think the focus in that analysis is not

15
16

upon the individual's right to choose.

the right to choose just as you or I do, but the

11

Well, Hr.

Eubenstone, getting back

12

to the interlocutory appeal queston have we not normally

13

treated violations of a Sixth Amendment right or even a

14

due process right as being in criminal cases not

15

reviewable by way cf interlocutory appeal?
MR. EUBENSTONE;

16

Yes, but I do not believe

17

that any of those decisions, for example, the denial of

18

the jury trial or the denial of proper notice has the

19

same kind of irreversible impact that denial of counsel

20

has.

proces s.

22

Denial cf counsel impacts upon the entire

The denial of a jury trial does not do that.

23

It only results in a finding, for example, and if the

24

denial was improper the remedy is simple, a new trial.

25

But I think that there is a world of difference between

Absolutely.

If the lower court’s decisions in this case

are upheld based as they are upon what the lower court

called potential conflicts — and I will use that word

for the purpose of this moment — if that decision is

3

All that the lower court did was to identify

4

the potential, to ignore the waiver, to ignore the

defendants' professions of innocence, to ignore the

6

defendants' determination to present a common defense

7

and to focus on the potential for the conflict.

QUESTION

Mr. Eubenstone, why is it do you

suppose that the government would take such an active

10

role in trying to seek disqualification?

11

in part of a feeling that the defendants are less likely

12

to break up and negotiate separate pleas if they are

13

represented by one attorney?

Is it a factor

14

Why is the government pressing?

15

MR. EUBENSTONE;

It is clear to me from my

16

experience that where defendants are jointly represented

17

there is a lesser likelihood that any of them will break

18

away and plead.

19

QUESTION;

And turn state's evidence?

MR. F.CBENSTONFi

I have no problem in seeing a

there is a demonstrated conflict.

QUESTION:

Sc what we are talking about here

10

is really what this record showed as respecting whether

11

there was a demonstrated conflict or whether the

12

13

MR. RUBENSTONE:

very clear a lot of the actual conflict cases involving

In those instances I think Rule 44 tells the

the Court;

18

I would like first by way of background tc ask

19

that the Court in thinking about disqualification issues

20

keep in mind that joint representation of codefendants

21

is not the only context in which this issue can arise.

22

There are other cases in which a defense lawyer can be

23

disqualified including a successive representation

24

situation where the lawyer formally represented a person

25

who is now a prosecution witness, situations where the

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

lawyer formally was a prosecutor who had seme arguatle

2

connection with the investigation that led to the

3

indictment of his now client, situations where the third

4

party is paying the fees and exercising some degree of

5

control over the representation of the defendant, and

6

even we’ve seen cases where there is the lawyer’s

7

potential involvement in the underlying offense or his

8

potential role as a witness which may call for his

9

disqualification.

10

Now I would like to say just a few words now

11

about the jurisdictional issue and come back to it later

12

if I have time.

13

say is that if I was told that we could win only one of

14

the two issues in this case we would rather win the

15

jurisdictional issue and lose the merits issue.

T think the first thing I would like to

Now the reason for this position is the

16
17

potentially devastating effects of delay in criminal

18

prosecutions as this Court has repeatedly recognized in

19

Cobbledick, DiBella, Hollywood Notor Cars and other

20

cases in which it has turned down interlocutory defense

21

appeals.

22

This case illustrates the potential damage.
The alleged victims in this case are street

24

be able to locate them — who are hard to — whose will

There are problems that are caused by the delay in this

QUESTI0H:

Hr. Frey, may I ask you this?

If

we were to agree with your friend and agree with his

proposition would it mean that in a Faretta case after

11

the judge had conducted a hearing on the qualifications

12

of the defendant to act as his own counsel and then

13

decided that he was not qualified and appointed standby,

14

would that be appealable?
HR. FPEY:

16

of my colleague, and I think the answer is clearly that

would not be appealable.

The reason that would not te

would not meet one of the requirements of interlocutory

Therefore, it would be treated as

So I would say that that, or we have situations

21

(Laughter)

22

MR. FREY;

Don't blame it on Mr. Frey.

My opinion is that the rule gives

23

the District Court broad discretion in a situation of

24

joint representation and that it would be the

25

extraordinary case in which an appelate court could find

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

abuse of that discretion.

7

In fact the rule says

From the advisory committee notes it is

8

absolutely clear that they contemplated that the

9

appropriate measures included disqualification, and it

10

is hard indeed in this situation to think of much elsa

So I do think there is broad discretion.

25

MR. FREY;

After all the ethical propriety of

circumstances it seems to me.

the adequacy of the waivers that we get in terms of our

interest as prosecutor, our selfish interest rather than

4

our broader interest in the administration of the

5

system .

6

We are concerned abcut

We have a waiver here in this case, but the

7

problems with waivers — We know that if there is a

8

conviction there will be an attack on that waiver in an

9

effort to set the conviction aside on the basis of the

10

joint representation because it happens repeatedly, and

11

there are a let of problems with waivers.

12

Obviously it is very difficult for a lay

defendant to appreciate the problems that are involved

in multiple representation.

there are lots of times they can affect some savings if

5

they retain a firm for joint representation.

7

MR. FREY:

I suspect

That dees

Well, I do not think it is — From

8

the standpoint of the clients they may have an interest

9

in saving money, but I do not think when weighed against

10

all of the other interests that are at stake that the

11

court can assert that they have this constitutional

12

right to conflict-ridden counsel which is the claim in

this case.

14

They should at least be advised at the outset

by their own lawyers.

16

absolutely clear is that there is no obstacle to

mounting a common defense, and there is no obstacle

18

after consultation each with their own lawyer to giving

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

It is by no means uncommon for us to have a

defendant come in to us and say I would like to talk to

7

is no a joke because telling his lawyer could have very

8

serious consequences in some instances.

This

9

QUESTIONS

What sort of serious consequences?

10

ME. FREY*

Well, it can have fatal

11

consequences because the lawyer is often nominally his

12

lawyer but actually — As I say this is not this case at

13

all but it is a class of circumstances that we have to

14

be concerned about with he waiver.

15

QUESTIONi

Nc one is saying there should never

16

be disqualification in joint representation, but it

17

seems to me the government's position it is fair to say

18

there can never be joint representation if the district

19

court says otherwise.

20

MR. FREYi

It may come close to saying that if

21

the district court — That is I think the decision that

22

underlies Pule 44(c) which is designed not if a conflict

23

actually exists but if there is any possibility or

24

likelihood that a conflict will arise.

25

Now if you had -- There are cases in which it

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

can be imagined where the likelihood of conflict is a

2

great deal less than in this case and where joint

3

representation might be permitted, and I think the

4

district court could take into account in dealing with

5

people just above the indigency line, the kinds of

6

economies that you -are concerned about in deciding when

7

it is dealing with a potential conflict in assessing how

8

serious it is.

9

It has the discretion to do this.

I am not sure what the answer is except that

10

the principles of the bar are very much against this

11

kind of representation of trying to serve people who may

12

have conflicting interests at the same time.

for the one defendant will keep things in hand.

20

there any way that the judge can prevent that so that

21

there would end up with being just one lawyer on the

22

defense side of the table?

Assuming he let the lawyer represent one of the

MR. FREY;

23

Of course, he has disqualified

Is

Nc, I suppose if the judge — I

24

my first reaction to that question is that the

judge probably could not prevent that although he would

then have to make special efforts to try to get them to

3

they can consult with a lawyer after which they may

4

choose to go forward with their joint defense, but it

5

would be quite strange for them to be even unwilling to

6

talk to another lawyer.

7

Now there is the problem in these cases of the

8

figure behind the arras, the third party paying the

9

fees,

and that is a factor in this case.

The fee is

10

being paid by a third party.

There is no assurance that

Or a mistrial of the entire case.

MR. FEEY;

Yes.

That is probably what it

would lead to if you had one lawyer in this situation.

7

There is no way to prevent as you mentioned earlier the

8

claim later on that the waiver of conflict free counsel

9

was either coerced or not intelligent or the product of

ineffective assistance on the part of the lawyer with

Yet here we have a situation where Flanagan

motion

the other three defendants were in places of

hiding from which they could not see what was
h appening.
They responded only to Flanagan's signal and,
therefore, they could not be accused of having illegally
arrested the victims in this case.

Yet I understand

that in other court proceedings these same people have
testified that they were in a position to see Flanagan
being mugged by the victims.
Now from Flanagan's standpoint that is much
better evidence if that could be and would be their
testimony.

From the standpoint of the other three

defendants it is obviously much better that they were
off around the corner and could not see.
Now I do not knew how one lawyer develops a
strategy that deals with this.

In the charges of

assaults in these cases the witnesses may be able to
clearly identify some, poorly identify others and not at
all identify yet others.

Hew does one lawyer represent

all these defendants fairly?

I do not think in short that the right that we
