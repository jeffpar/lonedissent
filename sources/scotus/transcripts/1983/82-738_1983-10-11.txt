ORAL ARGUMENT CF JCHN E. VINTILLA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. VINTILLA;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, in this civil rights action brought

11

under Sections 1983 and 85, the Sixth Circuit held that

12

res judicata principles barred the petitioner from

13

presenting her constitutional claims in the District

14

Court because she failed to raise them in a prior state

15

court proceeding.

16

The central issue before the Court is whether

17

a litigation of ‘statutory issues in a state court

18

precludes a party from pursuing her federal civil rights

19

claims which were not raised, litigated, or decided in

20

the prior state court litigation.

21

'This central question gives rise to two, we

22

believe, two subsidiary questions.

First, does the Chic

23

rule of res judicata bar the petitioner from pursuing

24

the instant action in the federal court, and secondly,

25

should a federal court, consistent with the'

Congressional policy underlying 1983, deny a civil

2

rights plaintiff a federal forum because he or she

3

litigated, and incidentally prevailed, on a narrow state

4

issue in a state court against the same parties.
The factual history or posture of this case,

5

6

we believe, is critical to a consideration and

7

determination of the issues before the Court.

In Ohio, a state board of education is, I

13

imagine, in most jurisdictions, is granted very bread

14

discretion in the renewal or non-renewal of a teacher.

15

Now, in the event that the respondent board determines

16

that a teacher should not be renewed, the board

17

required under Ohio law to notify the teacher on or

18

before April the 30th of the year in which the contract

19

is to expire.

20

And then recently our Supreme Court.of Ohio in

21

Tracey versus 0 ’Steigel Board, Six Ohio State Third 305,

22

also held that in that notification, the board must set

23

forth the basic reason for the non-renewal, although the

24

teacher is not entitled to what they call cause and a

25

hearing, cause and hearing mandate.

That wculd be a doctrine of state

MR. VINTILLA*

Yes, Your Honor, the Supreme

Court.

ncn-tenured teachers are not entitled to reasons for

6

non-renewal, since they are on a yearly basis, and each

7

year, at the end of the school year, their contract

It was believed that since non-tenured —

10

has until June the 4th, T believe, of that year to

11

determine whether he or she will accept, and then they

12

are entered into a written contract.
In our situation here, the respondent board

13
14

held a meeting on April the 17th of

1979, and adopted a

15

resolution unanimously to renew the contract of the

16

petitioner for the ensuing year, and subsequent to that

17

resolution or offer to continue her employment, the

18

petitioner duly accepted and notified the board that she

19

accepted the offer to serve for another year.
One week after the initial meeting of April

20
21

17th,

the 'board called a special meeting on April the

22

24th, at which time it rescinded, reconsidered the

23

renewal of the petitioner and rescinded its earlier

24

resolution to renew her, with a majority of three, a

25

three to one vote, and one member was absent because he

meeting, and he was at that time — in fact, two members

national education conference.

Now, as a result of the action of the board in

6

terminating the petitioner, she filed suit in the Common

7

Pleas Court of Trumbull County, Chic, and in that suit

8

she challenged the validity of the board's action in

9

terminating her, and her complaint in essence set forth

10 a breach of contract, and the second count, or second
11

cause of action, a tort action in the nature of a

12 conspiracy to violate her contract cf employment.
The trial judge held trial.

13

It was a bench

14

trial.

At the trial time he upon his own motion

15

reserved and continued the tort action, the second cause

16

of action, and held trial only on the narrow issue as to

17

whether or not the board, respondent beard acted in

18 conformity with the state law as to its non-renewal or

termination of. the — cf the petitioner.
The court then rendered its judgment, found

21

that the petitioner had a binding contract with the

22

school board, that the school beard breached the

23

contract, and therefore granted damages to the

24

petitioner in the amount of the salary she lost for the

25

year and ordered her reinstated to her position, but

and her contract expired in June, she never entered into

QUESTIONS

Mr. Vintilla, I guess there is no

5

question but that your client could have raised these

6

claims in the state court proceeding, could have filed

7

the 1983 and 1985 claims there?
MR. VINTILLA;

8
9

Oh, no question about it, under

concurrent jurisdiction, and Congress has granted to the

10

states concurrent jurisdiction to entertain a civil

11

had a choice.

Ohio law your client would thereafter be precluded

19

not brought them, that that would be

Is that right?
MR. VISTULA;

Well, I take the position, we

20

take the position that the Congressional intent in

21

granting plaintiffs — a civil rights plaintiff the

22

choice to go to federal court or the state court, we

23

believe that that grant by Congress is unconditional.

24

think as we understand the intent the Congress intended

25

to allow the suitor to determine whether he feels

comfortable in the state court, for whatever reason, for

2

local prejudice problems, and co to federal court.
QUESTION:

3

Despite the clear requirement that

4

federal courts give full faith and credit to state court

5

judgments?
ME. VINTILLA:

6

Well, I believe that if —

7

although in our case here, we will argue that Ohio res

8

judicata would not preclude, but I would say that — I

9

would say that if there were a state law to that effect,

10

which

11

away this free choice of which court to go to, and

12

making it mandatory, I would say that that law or that

13

policy would clearly contravene this Congrsessional

14

intent of allowing you, a civil rights plaintiff, to

15

choose without explanation.
QUESTION:

16
17

I would construe as making it mandatory, taking

How do you reconcile that with our

decision in Allen against McCurry?
MR. VINTILLA;

18

Well, Allen versus McCurry

19

dealt only with collateral estoppel.

New, I say if a —

20

as I understand Allen versus McCurry, I say if a civil

21

rights plaintiff voluntarily presents his claims tc a

22

state court or presents some issue that is material or

23

relevant to the determination of a civil rights action,

24

then he certainly has waived it or has foregone the

25

right,

or if he is confronted with collateral estoppel,

I agree, he should not relitigate an important material

2

issue.

3

QUESTIONi

Well,

Allen against EcCurry and, I

4

think.

5

— the original state adjudication was a criminal one,

6

wasn’t it, where certainly the appearance of the

7

defendant couldn’t he called voluntary.

Herring against Prcceze last year/ too, involved

MR. VINTILLA;

8

Well, it is not voluntary,

9

except in Herring, I think, I think there was a strong

10

motivation for Herring — or to say in Herring, if you

11

follow that, adopt that rule, there was a strong

12

motivation to say in Herring, here, I am faced with a

13

criminal conviction that is going to go on my record,

14

and I have a constitutional defense.

15

constitutional defense.

16

17

having a criminal record, or rather than risk this

18

voluntarily pleading guilty, and I think — but I think

19

the principle is the same.

I have a

action, and Justice Marshall said, if we adopt such a

2

rule, it would be anomalous.

3

And then Justice Marshall also goes into

4

running afoul cf this clear and established

5

Congressional intent, of this grave concern of Congress

6

that a civil rights suitor should have the selection.

7

His very valuable civil rights should be, if he chooses,

Did Justice Marshall at any time

say you could go to both courts?

11

KE. VINTILLAs

12

QUESTION;

Excuse me. Your Honor?

Did Justice Marshall say at any

13

time that the statute gives you the right to go to bcth

14

courts on the seame point?

15

HE. VINT ILIA;

No, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION;

17

(General laughter.)

18

MR. VINTILLA;

I didn’t think so.

Your Honor dealt with the

19

collateral estoppel statute of Virginia, but as a

20

further argument, T would -- I would — I would, as an

21

answer, like to adopt the statement cf Justice Harlan in

22

Monroe versus Pape, where he said, "A deprivation cf a

23

constitutional riaht is significantly different from and

24

more serious than a violation cf state right, and

25

therefore deserves a different remedy, even though the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

same act may constitute a state tort and the deprivation

2

of a constitutional right."

3

And in Ohio, incidentally, under the — not

4

incidentally, it is an important aspect of our case —

5

the tort, the second count cr second cause cf action in

6

the complaint in the state action was a tort action in

7

the nature of conspiracy.

8

dismissed that cause of action and — that is, reserved

9

— dismissed it, he dismissed it without prejudice, and

10

the language of "without prejudice" in Ohio means that

11

that is to be construed as an adjudication not on the

12

merits .
QUESTION;

13

Hhen the trial judge

Sell, new, to the extent that

14

you're — I think you said at the beginning cf your

15

argument you were making two points;

17

client ' s claim —

MR. VINTILLA*

One order — one-page order.

One paragraph.
QUESTION*

Mr. Vintilla, how do you explain

the comment in Justice — or, rather. Judge Banos’s

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

opinion at C-29 of the petition that the plaintiff could

2

have brought her First Amendment claim in state court,

3

and she is therefore barred from asserting it here,

4

citing Coogan against Cincinnati, which was a Fourth —

5

rather, a Sixth Circuit case that came out of Ohio?
HP. VINTILlAi

6

Fell, as I read Judge Hanes's

7

opinion, Judge Manos — and he cited another Sixth

8

Circuit opinion — he just was — took the position that

9

since state courts can entertain constitutional, full

10

constitutional issues, that there is no reason why he

11

should litigate them there, and since they can, you are

12

barred.

13

It is simple as that.
Now, the Coogan case, I mean, there are many

14

areas, and sometimes you have to make a fine distinction

15

where the courts confuse collateral estoppel with res

16

judicata, and there are many areas, and in most cases,

17

as I read them, what really happens is, the plaintiff in

18

the subsequent action or the civil rights plaintiff, he

19

is a disgruntled party.

20

He is seeking some way to get a second trial.

21

you analyze it closely, what he is really trying to do,

22

he wants to relitigate the issues that he lost on.

23

He lost in the first instance.
And if

Now, I believe in that situation, if you adopt

24

Allen versus McCurry, he runs into collateral estoppel,

25

and so he lost on the state level, he says, new I am

2

and see if I can’t get the state court to be more

13

14

addressed state law expressly, and said that any

subsequent litigation about a claim you could have

14

The judge did not indicate why he did not hear that —

17

as you are saying here, we do not want to be subjected

to a second suit, to the expense and the aggravation,

2

We were subjected to the same local political

3

prejudices and influences, and therefore we thought* we

4

are not going to get a full and fair hearing if we go

5

here, and we understand the position of the judge.

6

understand that he is thinking about future election,

7

and that’s the realities of life, and if he can avoid

8

antagonizing anybody, and we have no idea how widespread

9

the opposition — we know that the respondents were

We

10

vehement in their opposition, but we do not know — it

11

may very well involve other prominent citizens.
We do know that the state court judge had some

-- had some papers that respondent Swan had gathered,

14

and we have a companion related case in the district

court,

16

information or some relevant evidence or may lead us to,

give us information, and we have waited two and a half

18

years to have a determination as to whether or not we

can have discovery with those papers.

and we felt perhaps those papers may reveal soma

that could reasonably construe from what is in the

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. MESSENGER;

Fir. Chief Justice, and

20

Justices of the United States Supreme Court, the issue

21

before this Court is whether or not a state court

22

23

rights violated and files a law suit in state court to

24

get her job back, and also alleges conspiracy among the

25

board members to deprive her of her job, that once

having tried that lawsuit, can then embark upon a second

2

lawsuit in federal court alleging essentially the sa ire

3

facts, the came causes of action, hut racking onto it a

4

First Amendment or 1983 claim.
Both the United States District Court for the

5
6

Northern District of Ohio and the Sixth Circuit Ccurt of

7

Appeals felt that she should not, and that the

8

preclusive effect of res judicata barred the second

9

lawsuit that was filed in federal court.

The U.S.

10

District Court in Chic applied 1738 , the full faith and

11

credit clause, which essentially requires that federal

12

courts give preclusive effect to state court judgments

13

if in fact they would be a bar in federal court.
We believe that both lower federal courts were

14
15

right,

and that this Ccurt should affirm the opinions

16

below.

Both the state court action. Your Honors, and

17

the federal court action spawned from the same set cf

18

facts.

19

The petitioner had her job abolished.

The

20

reason her job was abolished was that at this, time in

21

northern Ohio, in Youngstown and Warren, we saw the loss

22

of 25,00C or 30,000 jobs in a two-year period of time.

23

All of our schools had to cut back on personnel.

24

this time, we had one of the finest school systems in

25

Ohio, but jobs like Cr. Yigra had, which was a

wayside, because they were a luxury.
Dr. Migra was well respected and well liked in

3
4

the Warren community.

An effort was found to keep her

5

in the school system, but there was no place for her.

6

Simply because of economic, financial reasons, her job

7

had to be abolished.

8

QUESTION

Is this all in the record?

9

ME. MESSENGER:

Yes, Your Honor.

It is not

10

only in the complaint, but also in the answer filed both

11

by the board and by the individual defendants.
Dr. Migra sued in state court to get her job

12

back, alleging a procedural difficulty at the board

17

and she won.

MR. MESSENGER*

She was reinstated, and with

19

back pay, and from that. Your Honor, we appealed to the

20

appellate court and to the Supreme Court of Ohio, and

21

the procedural difficulty that the board encountered was

22

basically held to be too bad.

in fact she was paid back pay.

the federal court from applying a stricter rule of res

MR. MESSENGER;

14

Honor,

17

that the federal courts would —
QUESTION;

16

Well, I would think, Your

And I would, I suppose, I would

think you would 'take that position.
MR. MESSENGER;

18

I would think. Your Honor,

19

that the federal courts would look at the substantive

20

law of the state courts in determining whether or not

21

the res judicata applies.
QUESTION;

22

Well, this one didn't.

This one

23

didn't.

It sounds to me like you are confessing error.

24

If a federal court must address Ohio law in 1738 and

25

didn't, it must have made a mistake.

I am suggesting

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that regardless of what state law would do, the federal

2

court can impose its own stricter rule of res judicata.

3

KR. MESSENGER*

4

QUESTION:

Of res judicata?

Well —

Isn’t that inherent in the

5

authority of the federal court with respect to its own

6

jurisdiction ?
MR. MESSENGER:

7

I think I would have to argue

8

that that is so, that it is, but it seems that the cases

9

appear to state that the federal court will look to what

10

the state law does on a particular matter such as res

11

judicata and then use that to fashion its remedy, but I

12

would certainly think, like in the field of labor law,

13

that the federal courts could fashion their own body of

14

law and their own system of whether or not res judicata

15

in fact would apply, but I believe this would only

16

amplify our position, that if the state court would

17

have —

18
19

QUESTION:

Eut it couldn't give any less

effect than the state law.

20

MR. MESSENGER:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Right.

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

But is that what the Court did in

Allen against McCurry?
MR. MESSENGER;

dy understanding of Allen and

24

McCurry, Your Honor, was that this Court stated

that res

25

judicata principles apply in 1983 actions, that prior to

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that time the argument was that only issue preclusion or

2

collateral estoppel applied, but the claim preclusion or

3

res judicata might not apply.

4

QUESTION;

5

But did it apply a federal rule of

res judicata or a Virginia rule?
MB. MESSENGER;

6

I can't answer that, Ycur

7

Honor.

I don't knew from memory whether — whether it

8

was, and I wouldn't want to guess at it, but at least

9

the holding of it seemed to say in our research when we

10

were preparing for this case was that the doctrine of

11

res judicata does apply in

12

petitioner has admitted that in its reply brief, that it

13

applies.

14

acknowledged that 1983 actions — or res judicata

15

applies to 1983 actions, then certainly it should apply

16

in this case, because this was a 1983 action that was

17

filed in the federal courts in Ohio.

So what we are saying is, if in fact it is

If it does apply,

18

1983 actions, and in fact the

then it bars the

19

petitioner's claim in this particular lawsuit, and the

20

lower courts were in fact dead right in dismissing the

21

case.

22

I think there is another policy —
QUESTION;

Isn't that oversimplifying it?

You

23

say the doctrine of res judicata applies, but there are

24

different doctrines of res judicata.

25

that requires that the issue be raised in the other case

There could be one

30

and one that dees not.

2

case of a property damage claim and a personal injury

3

claim arising out cf the same accident, one could have

4

different rules on that, and you have said the rule in

5

Ohio is clear, and therefore the case is barred. You

6

have not even argued, as I understand your brief, that

7

there is a federal rule that is more strict than the

8

Ohio rule.
SR. MESSENGER s

9
10

I mean, your example in your own

No, we haven’t.

We have

rested entirely on the Ohio —
QUESTION*

11

You think the statute applies,

and

12

you win on Ohio law, but Justice White, it seems tc me,

13

is correct in saying the lower court didn’t really

14

decide the Ohio law question, though, or do you take

15

issue with that?
MR. MESSENGER:

16

I believe that the lower

17

court,

18

for the Court, but I believe that the district court

19

looked at what the law of uhio was, the substantive law

20

of Chio —
QUESTION:

21
22
23

and again, Your Honor, I don’t mean to postulate

But they don't cite a single Ohio

case.
MR. MESSENGER:

I realize that.

They cite the

24

federal cases, and

the Coocan versus Cincinnati case.

25

And I do realize that our brief was structured along the

lines of the state law barrine; the present suit.
QUESTION:

2

Well, if we had — I would think

3

that if state law is critical to this case, and the

4

district court didn't decide it, nor did the court of

5

appeals, that we would have to remand.

6

normally decide state law questions in the first

7

instance.

9

applied, apparently didn't feel bound by state law.

10

We don’t

But it didn't sound to me like the district

It

was just a federal policy.
MB. MESSENGER:

11

Well, that is certainly an

12

argument, Your Honor, but to expand on that, and as

13

Chief Justice Burger said, why couldn't the federal law

14

— federal courts have their own doctrine of res

15

judicata that may be even mere strict than the state?
QUESTION:

10
17

I am suggesting that is what the

district court thought, and did.
MB. MESSENGER:

18

Eut certainly if it were

19

barred under applying state law, they would even be more

20

barred

21
22

than under federal law, so that —
'QUESTION:

you would have to hold it barred then.
