ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD PATTERSON, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. PATTERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is an appeal from a mandate of the Tenth

12

Circuit which ordered a new trial in a product liability

13

personal injury suit in which the verdict and the

14

resultant judgment were for the Defendant.

15

At the trial level fault was allocated to

16

non-parties under a procedure that is governed by Kansas

17

law and fashioned under the Federal Rules of Civil

18

Procedure where there already was quite a tight merger

19

between Federal Rules of Procedures and the substantive

20

law of Kansas.

21

A special verdict was returned in order to

22

accommodate that situation.

23

damages were also found under the procedure.

24
25

There was a finding in which

The ground for a new trial was what the Tenth
Circuit described.

It was an impairment to the use of a

peremptory challenge.
In order to focus upon the precise issue, I

3

believe it can best be accomplished by describing very

4

briefly what the case is not.

5

misconduct.

6

responding to the voir dire questions, was honest and in

7

good faith.

10

It is not a case of juror

The Tenth Circuit found the juror, in

It is not a question of juror qualification or
the lack of the statutory qualifications.
There was not a denial of a hearing to determine

11

whether or not actual bias existed.

12

granted, no hearing was requested after the court

13

permitted an interview with the juror by both counsel

14

simultaneously over the telephone.

15

16

No hearing was

Subsequent to that

There was no trial error that was identified.

17

We have the unusual situation, as was described in the

18

brief, of a wrong without a wrong-doer.

19

It was not a case of denial of a peremptory

20

challenge itself.

21

two-party case.

22

Each side was given three.

It was a

The contention and the ruling of the Circuit was

23

that a peremptory challenge was impaired due to the lack

24

of a level of information which counsel had at the time

25

the peremptory challenge had to be exercised.

1

In order to focus upon that, I think it is

2

necessary to subdivide and identify three more separate

3

issues which are really the substance of my argument.

4

The first is what I have denominated the

5

right-to-know argument.

6

level of information to which counsel are entitled that is

7

over and above that which is provided by good faith,

8

honest answers to proper voir dire questions?

9

Is there or should there be a

The Tenth Circuit held that there was that level

10

of information.

11

that level of information that would be provided by the

12

"average" juror.

13

That is the only description of the standard that we must

14

meet.

15

It was described by the Tenth Circuit as

That is the only description we have.

QUESTION:

You are saying then, Mr. Patterson,

16

that the Tenth Circuit went beyond requiring the juror to

17

in good faith answer the question as he understood it?

18
19

MR. PATTERSON:
point.

20

Secondly —

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Yes, sir, that is precisely the

Does that theory in any way allow the

counsel not to be diligent in his questions?
MR. PATTERSON:

Does not prohibit counsel from

24

asking any question, Your Honor, on a voir dire

25

examination.

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

2

QUESTION:

Does it also allow him not to ask

questions?

3

MR. PATTERSON:

As it was implemented in this

4

case, no, sir.

5

either way.

6

He can permit counsel to ask questions on voir dire or

7

there can be a combination of both.

8

done.

9
10

The court can ask all questions on voir dire.

QUESTION:

Does the duty of counsel recognize

MR. PATTERSON:

Our contention is that that is

the responsibility of counsel.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. PATTERSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

In this case both was

the duty to probe properly?

11
12

Rule 47, of course, gives the court leeway

And not of the court.
I am sorry, sir?

I mean that is the duty of the

counsel.

17

MR. PATTERSON:

18

QUESTION:

We suggest that it is, sir.

And, now at any time — Is it your

19

position that counsel in this case could have asked a

20

question which would have brought out this information?

21

MR. PATTERSON:

I think it could have been done.

22

It could have been responded to in the answers to the

23

questions that were asked.

24
25

Our position is that the fact that it does not
and did not does not show dishonesty on the part of the

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

juror and neither does it show a lack of good faith and

2

the Tenth Circuit observed that.

3

did rule was that counsel was entitled to a level of

4

information beyond good faith, honest answers.

5

QUESTION:

What the Tenth Circuit

Well, it says that it was entitled to

6

the kind of an answer that the average juror would have

7

given.

8

MR. PATTERSON:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And an average juror would have

10

understood that he should have revealed the information

11

that the didn't reveal.

12
13
14

MR. PATTERSON:

That is the standard that we

seek to challenge.
QUESTION:

Mr. Patterson, just for a minute, may

15

we return to the conversation, the post-trial conversation

16

between counsel?

17

MR. PATTERSON:

18

QUESTION:

19

Yes, sir.

The judge did not participate in

that, did he?

20

MR. PATTERSON:

21

QUESTION:

22

conversation between counsel?

23

Yes, sir.

That was granted.

The judge heard the telephone

MR. PATTERSON:

It happened in this sequence,

Early — After the trial, there was a motion

filed for leave to approach juror.

in the District, following the trial of the Kirkwood or

2

the Silkwood/Kerr-McGee case which absolutely prohibits

3

counsel from interrogating any juror after a trial without

4

the court's permission.

5

6

No juror contact was made.

Application was made by Plaintiff's counsel and
initially it was denied.

7

Soon thereafter a second application was made in

8

which there was an accompanying affidavit of the father of

9

the Plaintiff.

Plaintiff was a three-year old child.

The

10

father was a Navy recruiter.

11

a person in Olpe, Kansas, which I should explain is a

12

rather small community in Kansas of about 300, who had the

13

same surname as did the foreman of the jury.

14

He could recall the name of

18

seriousness of the injury.

conversation?

2

MR. PATTERSON:

3

QUESTION:

4

No, sir, he was not.

But, is there any difference of

opinion as to what transpired in that conference?

5

MR. PATTERSON:

Well, I would say we agreed on

6

about 70 percent-of it.

7

Tenth Circuit he placed what he recalled and I placed what

I recalled and —

QUESTION:

Can we accept what the Tenth Circuit

said about the substance of the conversation?

In counsel's brief before the

MR. PATTERSON:

The Tenth Circuit said that they

gave full credence to both versions.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. PATTERSON:

Can we accept it?
I believe so.

I am not going to

15

object to what was said by counsel in his brief in the

16

Tenth Circuit.

17

QUESTION:

May I ask right there —

18

MR. PATTERSON:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I was puzzled about the extent to

20

which that conversation was reported to the District

21

Judge.

22

MR. PATTERSON:

23

District Judge, that is the point.

MR. PATTERSON:

2

QUESTION:

No, sir.

So there was information about that

3

conversation that was made known to the Court of Appeals

4

and the Court of Appeals thought dispositive, which had

5

not been made known to the District Court.

initial comment that this was a trial without error.

is true.

The conversation was never reported to the trial
He never ruled on it.
QUESTION:

In the Court of Appeals, did you

11

object to the fact that you were then arguing about the

12

significance of a conversation that had not been disclosed

13

to the District Court?

14

MR. PATTERSON:

It was both orally and in the

15

briefs.

16

the record.

17

further down in my argument which raises the question of

18

whether or not there should be presumed prejudice.

19

point is the evidence, I believe, of the absense of

20

prejudice; that fact that it was not reported to the trial

21

court so that the trial court could then schedule a

22

hearing to determine actual bias.

23

And, it was something that occurred entirely off

Let me ask this because I have missed

something here.

QUESTION:

— we can rely on what the Court of

Appeals said was said.
MR. PATTERSON:

That is right.

I believe there

was no difference of opinion about what was said.
QUESTION:

Mr. Patterson, didn't the District

6

Court decide that the trial had been fair and wasn't that

7

decision made after this discussion as to whether or not

8

the juror should have disqualified himself?

9

MR. PATTERSON:

In the sequence of events, that

10

is what occurred.

11

correctly, and I could be off a day or two, but the motion

12

for new trial was actually filed, I believe, on the same

13

day that the telephone conversation occurred.

14

of a peremptory challenge was not one of the grounds for

15

new trial urged.

16

The motion for new trial, if I recall

Impairment

Ground No. 18 comes close to it and the error

17

identified there was the refusal of the trial court to

18

permit inquiry among jurors to determine whether or not

19

juror misconduct had occurred.

20

said, was broad enough to include the ground upon which a

21

new trial was granted by the Tenth Circuit, the denial of

22

a peremptory challenge.

23

QUESTION:

That, the Tenth Circuit

You lost me there.

Let's get our

24

time straight.

approximately the same day of this telephone conversation.

Can I ask you, suppose the juror had

information that was later brought out about the accident

10

MR. PATTERSON:

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes, sir.

Would there have been any basis for

challenging the juror for cause?

13

MR. PATTERSON:

14

QUESTION:

I doubt it.

That is really —

I suppose counsel would have asked

16

the judge to excuse — might have asked the judge to

16

excuse him for cause.

17

MR. PATTERSON:

It might have occurred but that

18

is a judgment call of the trial court.

19

presume to answer that question, because, you see, it

20

would be a matter of challenge for cause and under the

21

rules that is determined by the- trial judge alone.

might be requested.

answer and included the information that was later brought

2

out, was there any evidence one way or another as to

3

whether or not counsel would have exercised the peremptory

4

challenge?

5

MR. PATTERSON:

We believe there was, Your

6

Honor, because two other jurors revealed similar type

7

information.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. PATTERSON:

10

11

And he did not challenge?
They were not challenged.

They

both sat.
QUESTION:

But that is all there is.

Certainly

12

there couldn't have been any — There wasn't any hearing

13

as to whether he would or would not have exercised —

14

MR. PATTERSON:

15

QUESTION:

No, sir, there was none.

But, the Court of Appeals assumed

16

that he should have had the information so as to make up

17

his mind about using his peremptory challenge?

18

MR. PATTERSON:

The Court of Appeals in one

19

sentence held that bias as well as prejudice were

20

conclusively presumed.

21

that if the undisclosed information is of sufficient

22

cogency to cause us to believe counsel was entitled to

23

know of it when peremptory challenge was exercised.

24

you see, in one sentence conclusively presumes bias,

25

conclusively presumes prejudice so as to remove the case

The sentence was to the effect

about the prejudice, but how would they conclusively

MR. PATTERSON:

They appeared to do so.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Patterson, if the situation were

8

such that the information the juror failed to disclose was

9

information that clearly, under anyone's view, would have

10

constituted grounds for a challenge for cause of that

11

juror, would you feel that a new trial would have to be

12

granted?

13

MR. PATTERSON:

It depends upon whether or not

14

the information — I would suppose whether or not the

15

information was called for in the voir dire question that

16

was asked.

Clearly —

MR. PATTERSON:

case of midconduct.

20

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume it was.
If it was, then it would be a

That would be a matter of misconduct.
All right.

What if it wasn't called

21

for, but clearly the information would have given grounds

22

to challenge for cause.

23

You would say no new trial?

MR. PATTERSON:

Well, that again, I think, would

24

fall into the category of information that might have been

25

obtainable had a question been asked but was not otherwise

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

obtained for the failure to ask the question.

2
3
4

QUESTION:

So you would say that would be

waived?
MR. PATTERSON:

That would be waived.

That

5

would be counsel's responsibility, not misconduct on the

6

part of the juror or any mistake of the trial court.

7

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me that the

8

information might have — Let's assume the information

9

would have been clearly grounds for challenge for cause,

10

but the juror didn't answer and give that information.

11

suppose he might honestly have thought that the question

12

didn't call for that information and which everybody

13

agrees in this case was the case.

14

average juror objectively would have given the answers.

MR. PATTERSON:

QUESTION:

But, nevertheless, an

I

That is the rule that we seek to

Well, all right.

Let's assume that

19

anybody in his right mind would have given the full

20

answer, but, nevertheless, this particular person honestly

21

didn't give it.

22

misconduct, it is just that he didn't reveal this

23

information, although the average juror would have.

24

you then say a new trial was —

25

He was honest.

MR. PATTERSON:

He wasn't engaged in

No, sir, I would not.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

Would

I would

1

say then that the court was adding to the qualifications

2

of jurors beyond that which Congress authorized in 28

3

U.S.C. 1865(b)(2).

4

You see, you are announcing a standard.

You are

5

announcing a required level of performance of a juror

6

which might be beyond and might require a comprehension

7

and skill in the use of comprehending the English language

8

in the first place, recalling events rapidly in the scene

9

of a courtroom, because these questions very often have no

10

time limits to them, recalling all of the events that

11

passed through the bulk of their life, and, thirdly, an

12

ability to accurately relate that information.

13

involves some skills in the use of the English language.

14

Now, the only statutory requirement is that he

15
16

That

has to be sufficiently skilled to fill out the jury form.
We suggest this, that questions asked on voir

17

dire are bound to be understood differently as long as you

18

have jurors that come from all walks of society and that,

19

indeed, is the policy.

20

probably by decisions that preceded the statute, 28 U.S.C.

21

1861 through 65.

22

It is mandated by statute and

You have a cross section of the community.

23

have all ages, all occupational groups, all social and

24

economic status groups, both sexes, all races.

25

We suggest that that diverse group will not

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

You

1

comprehend all questions in exactly the same manner.

2

QUESTION:

Would you have challenged if the

3

Court of Appeals had sent the case back for a hearing in

4

the District Court?

5

MR. PATTERSON:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. PATTERSON:

8

Very —

With respect to prejudice or bias?
Very likely not.

We would have

held the hearing and gone from there.

9

QUESTION:

So you wouldn't say the fact that the

10

11

respect to whether a peremptory challenge would have been

12

exercised or not or whether there was actual bias by the

13

j uror?

14

MR. PATTERSON:

Well, I would have been

15

concerned about it, Your Honor, but I would have doubted

16

in my own mind whether the case in that posture would have

17

been the proper vehicle to present the question here that

18

we are presenting now.

What would have been the scope of the

20

hearing if there had been such a remand with respect to

Would they actually get into what went on in the

Hopefully not, because that is

Yes.

MR. PATTERSON:

No.

It would be a question of

whether or not the prior events that he was inquired about

had such an impact upon his attitude and his thinking that

he had already prejudged this type of case.

Well, you would have to just

decide — Could you have called him to the stand?

MR. PATTERSON:

More than likely.

So, you would —

So, it would have had to be sort of

an inferential conclusion?
MR. PATTERSON:
no other way.

It would have to be.

QUESTION:

You mean the inquiry would be

17

confined to the inquiry that could have been made at the

18

trial, at the selection of the jury?

19

MR. PATTERSON:

Well, the inquiry would be

20

limited to whether or not he had a state of mind that

21

might have come close to prejudging the issues prior to

22

the time he heard any evidence on it.

23

That is what I understand by the term "actual bias."

24

Certainly it could not involve anything that went on in

25

the jury room.

That would be it.

That is prohibited.

QUESTION:

In your research, have you come

across any case close to this one?

MR. PATTERSON:

We have attempted to — The

QUESTION:

I am talking about extending the

rule.

We find that —

MR. PATTERSON:

Circuits have held that this is

not a ground for a new trial unless there is either juror

10

misconduct or a finding of actual bias and a finding of

11

actual prejudice.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

That is what I said.

Is there one

like this?
MR. PATTERSON:

We have found none, Your Honor,

15

that does this, nor have we found any that sets up a

16

standard which required a standard of the "average" juror

17

which requires a minimum standard —

20

QUESTION:

We would just be putting out a rule

based on a case that is unique in its own facts.
MR. PATTERSON:

Well, I wouldn't say that the

facts are unique.

the rule of the Tenth Circuit is what is unique.

It is really quite typical.

have objected to a remand rather than an order for a new

trial.

3

to think could be based on the fact that this juror,

4

although he was honest, didn't give this information on

determined, based on all the evidence, that counsel would

have exercised a peremptory challenge to exclude this

Certainly.

Because of an interference with

MR. PATTERSON:

No.

Well, I think — Let me identify

the steps of our analysis first.

actual prejudice until you first make this initial

concession that there is a level of performance that the

court can require.

You should say you would be here making the same kind of

2

an argument if there had been a remand for a hearing

3

rather than an order for a new trial.

4

MR. PATTERSON:

I probably would have gone that

5

route rather than raising the question with a case in that

posture as being the vehicle to raise this question.

we are not in that posture.

whether or not there should be that kind of a requirement.

QUESTION:

But,

We do raise the question of

The Appellee used up all of his

challenges, peremptories?
MR. PATTERSON:

All parties used all three

challenges.
QUESTION:

Well, what good would that do here?

14

I understood you to say he would have exercised his

15

peremptory.

What peremptory?

16

MR. PATTERSON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. PATTERSON:

No.

He didn't have any.
All three challenges were used.

19

The contention, Your Honor, is that he used — He was

20

required to use his peremptory challenges at a time when

21

he lacked information to which he was entitled.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. PATTERSON:

That is really going.
Our question is or our

contention is that he is entitled to that information that

is provided by honest, good faith answers of voir

That is about all you can ask.

To what extent is there a

questionnaire available to counsel throughout the numbers

of the array of prospective jurors?

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

8

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE E. SCHROER, ESQ.

9

Mr. Schroer?

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. SCHROER:

11

Our theory is based upon the fact that there is

12

a distinct difference between the kind of misconduct that

13

is involved when either an outside person or a person in

14

the jury, after the jury has been selected and heard the

15

case, as distinguished from the kinds of right to

16

information to which the Plaintiff is entitled or the

17

Defendant is entitled during questions to voir direment.

18

May it please the Court:

In Kansas, we selected 12 jurors to sit in a

19

panel, an array, and after all the questions were over,

20

first by the court and then by counsel, we each exercised

21

three peremptory challenges.

22

by voir direment.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

It wasn't done voir direment

What is the ultimate number of the

jury you end —
MR. SCHROER:

MR. SCHROER:

3

So, we each, by putting 12 in the box, there

Six.
At that time.

4

were six remaining after three peremptories were

5

exercised.

6

the court asks preliminary questions, general, vague,

7

broad questions about job, employment, where you work,

8

where your wife works, and then allows counsel to conduct

9

independent voir dire.

10

We don't weigh peremptories in Kansas.

And,

The whole point of this case — We believe the

11

Tenth Circuit is right and the cases that preceded our

12

case.

13

three peremptories if lawyers don't get truthful

14

information from jurors.

15

The fact that it is a meaningless right to have

QUESTION:

Other circuits —

When you say "truthful," Mr. Schroer,

16

do you mean non-false information from the point of view

17

of the person answering or kind of objectively truthful?

18

MR. SCHROER:

Perhaps I should have said full

19

and complete rather than suggesting truthful versus

20

untruthful.

21

This is a case where, as the Tenth Circuit said,

22

any reasonable juror would have responded.

23

some five or six other questions asked by counsel for —

24

Well, first by the judge in the general text, can you be

25

fair, would you be a fair juror if you were representing

There were

the Plaintiff in this case, do you think you would be

2

fair — you would be the kind of juror the Defendant would

3

want in this case.

QUESTION:

has any bearing on the point you are making now?

6
7

MR. SCHROER:

I think it has a bearing only in

the way of background, Your Honor.

8
9

Do you think that general question

QUESTION:

If the man gave an affirmative

response that he could be fair or was silent, would not

10

everyone in the courtroom have a right to assume that he

11

was stating he could be fair?

12

MR. SCHROER:

That is the only reason I raise

13

that point.

14

that point is because counsel seems to imply that we have

15

to show a mental positive bias or prejudice on the part of

16

that juror and we suggest that the right to know, such as

17

in the Swain case and other cases by this Court, in the

18

peremptory setting is totally different from misconduct

19

involved after a jury commences to deliberate or there is

20

outside influence or threatened.

21

and complete answers is important subjectively to the

22

trial lawyer in trying to decide how to unselected three

23

whom he might think would be the three worst jurors for

24

him.

25

I agree, Your Honor.

were asked by the court, by myself, and by counsel where

people were talked about their sons getting their finger

in a bike, very insignificant kinds of questions, because

to waive the rule under just cause and say we have got

the Kansas rule.

run to the Judge, talk to the defense lawyer, and come to

the Plaintiff leaving the courtroom, saying how much does

concerned is that information would have been important to

make any difference whether it was truthful, it wasn't

I believe it was eight trial days.

A weekend was involved.
QUESTION:

Supposing it was, instead of eight

20

trial days, it would have been eight trial months, eight

21

trial months the trial had gone on, would you still say

22

that an error like this described by the Court of Appeals

would require a new trial and the reassembling of all the

24

judicial machinery to take another eight months?

/

25

MR. SCHROER:

I would, Your Honor, because I

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 626-0300

1

think that as Justice White said in the Swain case, this

2

is a very important right, the peremptory right, to be

3

exercised with knowledge and with truth and arbitrarily by

4

the — that may not be the exact words in your opinion —

5

but the right of the lawyers and this Court has even held

6

where courts have restricted that right of information or

7

not allowed questions to be asked on peremptory or not

8

asked questions which lawyers requested; that that

9

affected the right of peremptory — the use of the

10

peremptory statute.

11

QUESTION:

Surely no right is absolute.

I mean,

12

there must be an interest in the finality of jury verdicts

13

to a certain extent.

14

MR. SCHROER:

That is right and I agree, Your

15

Honor, and that is why the Tenth Circuit said if it is de

16

minimus, like the lady with the $100 case or the case

17

where the lawyer didn't ask the question, it was so vague

18

that the jury didn't understand the question, it can't be

19

reversed on those grounds.

20

But, it is where it is substantial or where a

21

reasonable jury would give this kind of information that a

22

lawyer is entitled to know so that he might ask follow-up

23

questions.

25

judge saying brief and polite, we had about a two-minute

2

conversation which he said those things that are agreed to

3

in the record which affects — Which doesn't show basic —

4

I shouldn't say basic misconduct or prejudice, but it

6

shows information that I would have liked to have

6

considered in making my three selections.

7

QUESTION:

Yes, but I am talking about the Court

8

of Appeals.

9

told the trial judge to hold a hearing rather than order a

10

Do you think the Court of Appeals should have

new trial?

11

MR. SCHROER:

12

QUESTION:

The dissent did.

Well, the dissent but how about the

13

majority?

14

you are here — Are you here defending that or not?

The majority ordered a new trial and I suppose

15

MR. SCHROER:

16

QUESTION:

I am here defending that, sir.

When did you tell the District Judge

17

about this telephone conversation in relation to the

18

motion for a new trial?

19

MR. SCHROER:

The motion for new trial, on page

20

60, only informs the court, and the affidavits, the two

affidavits —

you had found —

MR. SCHROER:

That was not my question.
The specific information was not

1

communicated to the trial court because we believe that we

2

were prevented from making a record by the trial court and

3

we believe that the trial court should have let us, on

4

motion for new trial, bring the juror in and we

5

believe —

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SCHROER:

Did you ask the trial judge for that?
Yes, yes.

On page 94 of the

8

Appendix we request oral argument and request the court

9

subpoena the jurors.

10
11

QUESTION:

MR. SCHROER:

You are correct, Your Honor.

The

specifics —

14
15

That does not say about the telephone

conversation.

12

13

We felt at that point —

QUESTION:

Well, why didn't you tell him about

the telephone conversation?

16

MR. SCHROER:

Why, w-h-y?

All right, sir.

The reason we

17

didn't in all honesty, sir, is because we felt that that

18

was what we were going to bring up on motion for new

19

trial.

20

QUESTION:

Weren't you just a guilty of

21

withholding information from the judge as you allege the

22

juror was withholding information from you?

23

MR. SCHROER:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SCHROER:

I hope not, sir.

I hope not.

Counsel —
The Kansas rule is kind of unique

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

because when we had filed our first motion for just cause,

2

as the rule provides, the court responded there was no

3

concrete evidence.

4

and should have been required under Kansas rule to reach a

5

threshold with no concrete evidence.

6

show just cause why the court should have allowed the

7

jurors to be brought in under oath with a record and

8

examined, not with regard to prejudice, but with regard to

9

whether or not they withheld information necessary for the

10

We didn't attempt to reach a threshold

We merely had to

right of the exercise of the peremptory challenges.

11

And, I think the Circuit cases I have looked at,

12

there is only one that I think disagrees with our premise.

13

QUESTION:

Counsel, before you proceed, let's

14

assume that when you had this conversation with the juror

15

who had remained silent he said, yes, I did have a son who

16

had an accident that hurt his leg rather badly and we did

17

bring suit and we won a $500,000 judgment, but I thought

18

this was just information that might prejudice one side or

19

the other so I kept quiet.

20

MR. SCHROER:

What would your position be?

That is an excellent question.

21

May I also assume, Your Honor, the jury went the other way

22

and decided for the Plaintiff?

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SCHROER:

25

QUESTION:

Well ~
See, that is the significance.

Yes, but I am assuming you lost the

37

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

case.

2

What is your answer?
MR. SCHROER:

My answer is, an officer of the

3

court with Defendant there, I would have to agree with his

4

oral integrity — I mean, on the basis of integrity, have

5

to agree —

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SCHROER:

8

QUESTION:

9

You would still be here today?
Would I still be here today?

Well, I am assuming you lost all the

way around.

10

MR. SCHROER:

The Tenth Circuit, under the

11

previous cases, would have said, go back for a new trial

12

and -—

13

QUESTION:

It would have?

If the Tenth Circuit

14

says you have a right to know, would the Tenth Circuit

15

have reversed the case?

16

MR. SCHROER:

Well, if I understand your

17

assumption correctly, the Tenth Circuit in these three

18

cases, two preceding this one, have all reversed cases,

19

one for the Plaintiff, where the Defendant has appealled

20

because somebody didn't mention about an injury case or a

21

trial that they were involved in.

22

QUESTION:

How could you have been prejudiced if

23

the juror had withheld the information that his son had

24

recovered $500,000?

25

MR. SCHROER:

Well, I couldn't have been, that

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

is right.

2
3

And, there are cases —
QUESTION:

That kind of prejudice is immaterial,

is it?

4

MR. SCHROER:

I could have been prejudiced.

5

There is a case in the Circuit where a Defendant — There

6

was a juror that had not answered questions about him

7

being a Defendant in a case and the Plaintiff won and the

8

Defendant then claimed error because the Defendant didn't

9

tell about his being a Defendant in a case and the Circuit

10

said, no, it didn't work against you so there is no error

11

there, you see.

12

I don't know how I can impress an argument —

13

QUESTION:

But, on the facts of this case,

14

supposing you had gotten the judgment and precisely the

15

same information was developed that has been developed

16

here; namely, the Foreman didn't disclose the injury to

17

his son.

18

on these facts?

Would the Defendant be entitled to a new trial

19

MR. SCHROER:

20

QUESTION:

21

22

I think so because —

Either side could have set aside a

verdict in this case —
MR. SCHROER:

Based upon our theory both lawyers

23

have a right to know this information about a person's

24

attitude toward bringing cases and filing suit.

25

QUESTION:

Let me ask one other mechanical

39
AL0ER8ON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

question if I may.

2

interrogated on the voir dire, 12 potential jurors?

There were 12 people who were

3

MR. SCHROER:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And, six were excused on the

5

peremptory, each using three peremptories.

6

any challenges for cause, is that correct?

7

MR. SCHROER:

8

QUESTION:

9

No one used

No, sir.

So those 12 were the only 12 that

were ever asked this question.

10

MR. SCHROER:

Yes.

This could have developed

11

information that would have been a challenge for cause

12

that allowed us another peremptory, but I don't know that

13

at this point.

14

The significance to us, and I think the Tenth

15

Circuit and the other Circuits are all in agreement except

16

for one case in the Fifth, the Vezina case, I think all

17

agree there is a distinction between misconduct of the

18

jury and the kind of prejudice necessary after the jury

19

becomes a jury and the kind of information that the

20

Plaintiff or the Defendant is entitled to as a matter of

21

right to exercise arbitrary or capricious or hunch or

belief —

Now we get into memory again.

Counsel's memory and notes are a

little different - from mine.

QUESTION:

What is now in writing that we could

look at other than asking your personal recollection of

MR. SCHROER:

There are our recollections that

11

are in the record on appeal to the Tenth Circuit where

12

counsel agrees with them.

QUESTION:

By saying in the record, do you mean

in the briefs?
MR. SCHROER:

In the Appendix, yes, and in the

16

briefs it is referred to.

17

a couple of phrases in addition to our recollection.

18

important thing is we were ordered to be brief and the

19

call was so short that I didn't feel, as an officer of the

20

court, I could push it any further.

21

fact that he admitted that he didn't give information he

22

knew about and was aware of, because accidents are apart

of life and that kind of cavalier attitude, I thought

should have been enough for the trial court to have

25

granted a motion for a new trial or at least held a

hearing, letting us subpoena the jurors and letting us

2

establish not bias and not prejudice —

QUESTION:

Let me ask one other question.

You

say that should have been enough for the trial judge.

you have an oral argument on the motion for new trial?

MR. SCHROER:

Did

He refused to allow oral argument.

We asked for it and it was not allowed.
QUESTION:

And you never submitted in writing to

him what you thought should have been enough?
MR. SCHROER:

Well, we submitted — I didn't

submit specifics of the word conversation.
QUESTION:

Well, you never told him anything

13

about the telephone conversation.

14

argument so you didn't tell him orally and you didn't file

15

anything in writing other than what has already been

16

called to our attention.

17

MR. SCHROER:

You didn't have an oral

That is correct.

We felt

18

precluded from making a decent record and we didn't feel

19

that the court wouldn't find just cause.to let us examine

20

the juror, he sure wouldn't believe oral conversations or

21

attorneys —

22
23

QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals didn't think you

had been remiss at all.

24

MR. SCHROER:

25

QUESTION:

No, sir.

No, sir.

And they gave you relief.

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

MR. SCHROER:

2

QUESTION:

3

That is right, sir.

They didn't think you had passed up

any opportunity you had in the trial court.

4

MR. SCHROER:

No, sir.

That is correct, sir.

5

And, I think that is very significant because they say

6

that the important thing is would a reasonable juror have

7

responded and if a reasonable juror would have responded,

8

then the Plaintiff was entitled, under the statute, to

9

have that kind of response from this juror and the failure

10

of his giving that response affected my right to

11

peremptory challenge and that right to peremptory

12

challenge would indicate or that would also indicate

13

implied bias.

14

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Schroer, you are not

15

indicating or contending, I guess, that the information

16

disclosed here would have entitled that the juror be

17

excused for cause, are you?

18
19

MR. SCHROER:

We didn't know.

We didn't get to

ask him enough —

20

QUESTION:

Well, whether you know it or not, we

21

know now.

22

to have the juror excused for cause, are you?

You are not contending that that is sufficient

23

MR. SCHROER:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SCHROER:

By itself, no.

Okay.
But, the follow-up questions may

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

have developed an attitude by him that the court would

2

have excused for cause.

3

to follow up and say, why do you feel that accidents are

4

apart of life and why do you feel everybody has accidents

5

and why do you think that it is not important?

6

QUESTION:

That is my point.

We didn't get

I guess you could have asked

7

questions like that of all the jurors as you went along

8

and you probably typically do, don't you?

9

MR. SCHROER:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SCHROER:

We ask —

About your attitudes.
What we do is we ask the general

12

question and then if you get responses as counsel — as I

13

did and as counsel did, then on follow-up questions —

14

And, in fact, counsel asked two or three follow-up

15

questions on accidents and injuries after I finished and

16

that is when some jurors responded to some de minimus type

17

of events that happened many years ago.

18

And, what I am suggesting is had this juror had

19

responded, both myself and skilled counsel for the

20

Defendant would have inquired about his attitudes.

21

just can't ask somebody directly are you prejudiced. •

22

QUESTION:

You

Yes, but some of that is present in

23

every jury selection in America.

24

some jurors disclose and some that others do not, and if

25

one does, you are likely to follow up, and if one doesn't,

There are things that

presuming things.

5

And, you have to be very careful in fashioning

You might be wearing the other shoe at

MR. SCHROER:

I agree.

And, there is a good

6

amicus brief in this case filed by Southern Union Company

7

where the shoe is on the other foot.

8
9

But, the Tenth Circuit said it can be de minimus
and can be unimportant.

Like, for example, if someone

10

said I have got six kids and he had seven kids or many

11

other — There is a Tenth Circuit case where someone

12

forgot about a hundred dollar settlement.

13

is de minimus.

They said that

14

The question is whether it is substantial.

15

QUESTION:

16

Well, maybe what is important is

whether it indicates a probable bias.

17

MR. SCHROER:

18

QUESTION:

19

20

That is right.

Is that the test, whether the

responses would indicate a probable bias?
MR. SCHROER:

Whether a probable bias can be

21

implied sufficient so that counsel, with the right to full

22

information of the statute, could use a peremptory

23

or not use a peremptory, but needs that information to

24

exercise his right of peremptory.

25

QUESTION:

Okay.

The basic issue —

But, you would agree that the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

information that isn't disclosed should at least be

2

something that would indicate probable bias?

3

MR. SCHROER:

6

say are you bias?

of mind that can't be definitively proven.

You can't go in to the jury and

Nobody admits to bias and there is

QUESTION:

10

you have in Kansas?

Mr. Schroer, how many peremptories do

11

MR. SCHROER:

12

QUESTION:

Three.

On page 64 of the Joint Appendix,

13

there seems to be eight strikes.

14

MR. SCHROER:

Who are the other two?

Okay, let me mention.

After the

15

six are empaneled, the jury says, now, we are going to

16

select two alternates and you each will be given another

peremptory challenge.

18

selected, two alternates were selected and we were each

QUESTION:

Do you just have the sheet and pass

it back and forth?

4

MR. SCHROER:

That is exactly right, sir.

And,

5

there is no such thing as only exercising two

6

peremptories, becuase when you have got 12 in the box, you

each have to take your three and that is the way we do it

in the District of Kansas and it works.

MR. SCHROER:

Your Honor, I don't know that I

understand what you are asking me.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SCHROER:

I —

Well, there is no record here.
There is a problem with the record

8

and we believe that we were prohibited from making that

9

record by the trial court's refusal to let us bring the

10

jurors in and examine them on the record and under oath.

11

We had no other alternative.

12
13

QUESTION:

How do we do it other than to send it

back to the District Court?

14

MR. SCHROER:

I wanted to mention that in

15

argument.

16

Circuit that were not decided and they were not mentioned.

17

And, I would cite Jackson, the Second Circuit case of

18

1968, where the Circuit Court stated that the view we have

19

taken of Juror Kemper's disqualification precludes the

20

need to deal with other points raised by the Appellant.

21

There are serious other points in this case.

22

There were several other issues in the Tenth

The Court has three alternatives, I suppose.

23

One is to, I think, if you agree with counsel for the

24

Petitioner, to send it back to the Tenth Circuit and say

25

decide these other issues you didn't mention, because you

49
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

2

can't just leave them hanging.
A second choice would be to send it back to the

3

trial court and have a hearing on whether or not this

4

untruthful or not full or not complete response to the

5

question affected in the trial court's mind a right to the

6

statutory peremptory challenges and the right to have full

7

information to base that on.

8
9

We think that those are the only two
alternatives except to affirm the Circuit Court, which we

10

respectfully suggest should be done, because the Circuit

11

Court said in this case the kind of misinformation or

12

non-information rises to a level that it can be judged by

13

an Appellate Court to be so important that it affected the

14

right to peremptory challenge by the very nature of it.

MR. PATTERSON:

The purpose of a hearing, I believe, is to

harmless error once you reach the conclusion that a right

MR. PATTERSON:

I have to confess that I

Was there a

the question of the consequence of that denial by a

QUESTION:

Would you take the same position if

The problem is we don't know exactly

That is right.

That would come

far closer to a case of juror misconduct, but, yoti see,

22

what makes this such a dangerous rule is that the Tenth

Circuit acknowledged he" was honest and in good faith, but

they are still entitled to this information level but they

give us no way by which this information could be

QUESTION:

I am just wondering — I am sorry to

3

take so much of your rebuttal time, but what is your

4

position with respect to the soundness of Judge Barrett's

5

position?

6

Do you think Judge Barrett was right or wrong?
MR. PATTERSON:

Part of each.

On the question

7

of whether or not a denial of a right had a consequence

8

other than harmless error requiring a hearing, yes, he is

9

right.

It should not be concluded that it was anything

10

other than harmless error.

11

concluded that there was bias or that there was prejudice

12

in the absence of a hearing.

That is it should not be

13

But, on the initial step that there was a denial

14

of a level of information to which he was entitled, no, we

15

disagree.

right exists, but how is it obtained?

17

that.

18

We see that the Tenth Circuit says that that

If we were to try the case again, what would we
