ORAL ARGUMENT CF MS. CAROLYN CORWIN, ESQ.,

ON EEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MS. CORWIN;

6
7

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
The question raised in this case concerns the

8
9

Ns. Corwin, you may

interpretation of 5 U.S.C.

8132, the reimbursement

prevision of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.
Under Section 8132, a federal employee whe has

11
12

suffered a work-related injury, who has received FICA

13

benefits on account of that injury, and whe sues and

14

recovers from a third party in connection with that

15

injury, must reimburse the federal government out of his

16

third

party recovery.

17

The question here is whether that statutory

18

duty to reimburse exists when state law provides that

19

the third party recovery may net include damages for

20

medical expenses and lest wages.
Respondent is a government employee whe was

21
22

injured in a work-related automobile accident.

He

23

received FICA benefits in the amount of approximately

24

£2,000

25

and made up for his lost wages.

which allowed him to pay for his medical expenses

3

Respondent then sued the driver of the other

1
2

car and eventually settled for $8*500.

Secretary of

3

Labor sought reimbursement for the FICA benefits that

4

had been paid out in the amount of approximately $1,600,

5

which represented the FICA benefits less a reasonable

6

attorney’s fee.
Even though Respondent’s recovery was more

7
8

than five times the amount that the Secretary of Labor

9

was seeking to be reimbursed, Respondent took the

10

position that he did not have a duty to reimburse

11

because his settlement did not include amounts that

12

represented medical expenses and lost wages.
That is because the Pennsylvania no-fault

13
14

insurance statute abolishes tort liability for economic

15

losses, including medical expenses and lost wages, that

16

fall below the ceiling set by the Pennsylvania statute

17

for no-fault coverage.
The district court held nevertheless that the

18
19

statute Section 8132 did require Respondent to

20

reimburse, citing the Ostrowski case from the Sixth

21

Circuit.

22

rejected the Ostrowski case.

23

view, the federal government was to be a model employer

24

and that that was Congress* intent underlying the

25

statut e .

The Third Circuit reversed and explicitly
In the Third Circuit's

4

Fcr that reason the Third Circuit thought that

1
2

Section 8132 ought to be interpreted so that a federal

3

employee would be at least as well off as an employee

4

covered by the state workers’ compensation system.

5

Because the Pennsylvania courts had held that under the

6

state workers’ compensation law a compensation carrier

7

would not be subrogated to the rights of an employee in

8

a situation like that of respondent, the ccurt concluded

9

that the Section 8132 of the federal statute should not

10

— should be read in an analogous manner to the

11

Pennsylvania law.
Our position in this case is a straightferward

12
13

one.

14

on its face requires reimbursement from Respondent to

15

the federal government.

16

to what the court of appeals believed, the result is

17

consistent with the purposes that underlie the

18

reimbursement provision.

19

First, we think that the language of Section 8132

Second, we think that contrary

Now, the language of Section 8132 seems

20

clearly to require reimbursement from anything that an

21

employee recovers from a third party on account of his

22

work-related injury.

23

has always read this statute.

24
25

That is how the Secretary of labor

Section 8132 refers to money or other property
an employee recovers -5

QUESTION:

1

2

What part of 8132 are you reading

from?
MS. CORWIN:

3

Well, I'm referring to the

4

language that -- that talks about money or ether

5

property, and that -- that comes within the first

6

sentence.

You have to go down several lines.

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. CORWIN:

9

QUESTION:

10

page 2A of the brief.

11

MS. CORWIN:

That's quite a sentence.
It is a long sentence.
Okay.

It's six lines.

Right.

I guess on

The money or other

12

property which an employee recovers in satisfaction of

13

the third party's liability.

14

legal liability in that liability in --

15

QUESTION:

And there's a reference to

But it says "in satisfaction cf

16

that liability."

17

refer back to just to the FICA liability, which is

18

limited in nature to lost wages and medical benefits.

19

And, of course, that language may

MS. CORWIN:

Well, I think the legal liability

20

to which it refers is the liability of the third party.

21

Now, you can go back tc the injury or death for which

22

compensation is payable, but I think in terms of the

23

damages or the money or other property, that refers to

24

the liability of the third party.

25

QUESTION:

Well, it's not clear, in any
6

1

event

2

MS. CORWIN:

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, I — I —
I think ycu have tc lcck at

something else to determine the meaning of it, don’t you?
MS. CCRWINi

5

Well, I — I think that certainly

6

on its face the statute does not in any way distinguish

7

among the different sorts of damages ycu could have.

8

-- it refers to the liability.

9

death for which compensation is payable, but it doesn’t

It

It refers to injury cr

10

QUESTION:

11

Well,

I guess you wouldn’t say that

12

recovery from a third party of property damage is going

13

to be payable over tc the United States.
MS. CORWIN:

14

No.

And we've said in our reply

15

brief that’s never been the position of the Secretary.

16

And I think if you look at the statute, it refers to

17

this injury cr death fcr which compensation is payable.

18

Under the FICA system, FICA benefits take

19

damages for personal injury and not for property

20

injury.

21

is damaged in a work-related situation, there is a

22

separate prevision in Title 31, Section 3721, I believe,

23

that allows you to present a claim for your property

24

damage .

25

the place cf

If someone — if scmecne's damages -- property

But in terms of the compensation scheme we’re
7

1

talking about here, which is the Federal Employees'

2

Compensation Act, these benefits are designed tc take

3

the place of what you would ordinarily get for your

4

personal injury as a result of a work-related accident.
QUESTION:

5
6

Well, lost wages and medical

expenses.
MS. CORWIN:

7

Well, that -- that is how the

8

benefits are measured, but in terms of what they are

9

designed to replace or — or represent, that is the

10

employee's exclusive remedy under the statutory scheme;

11

that is, those benefits are designed to -- to compensate

12

the employee for any sort of personal injury.

13

-- that is typical cf a statutory compensation scheme in

14

that r espect.
QUESTION:

15
16

That is

FICA doesn't include pain and

suffering.
MS. CORWIN:

17

Well -- well, under FICA you —

18

you receive benefits in place of any other damages you

19

might get.

20

third party tort fees around, you get your FICA benefits

21

and that’s all.

22

you would otherwise get in -- if you were allowed tc

23

bring a tort suit against the United States, for

24

example.

25

place of any sort of damages within the statutory

If — if you are injured and there is rc

They take the place of anything that

Sc in that sense, they really -- they take the

8
#

1

compensation scheme

2

QUESTION*

But is FICA set up so that it

3

includes not only elements for lost wages and medical

4

expenses, but also some sort of element for what wcrld

5

be pain and suffering in a jury negligence trial?
MS. CORWIN*

6

There — no, there is nc amount

7

that you receive that is denominated pain and suffering;

8

but when you look to the entire statutory scheme, the

9

FICA benefits that --that are received by an employee

10

in effect take the place of any sort of damages you

11

might otherwise recover against your employer.
QUESTION*

12

Well, I realize that's the case.

I

13

was trying to find out whether the FICA statute is like

14

I understand many state workmen's compensation statutes

15

to be,

16

than pain and suffering, or whether FICA is -- if ycu

17

took a

18

would

19

jury award in favor of a plaintiff?

20

kind of giving payment for things other than —

FICA, the average actuarial value of a FICA,
it look very much like the actuarial value of a

MS. CORWIN;

Well, no.

I don't think so.

And

21

I think if you're comparing it to state schemes,

22

would be similar in the respect you’ve suggested; that

23

when you're measuring the amount an employee gets, ycu

24

generally look to the medical expenses incurred; you

25

look to perhaps a payment on a schedule for disability;
9

it

1

you look to some percentage of lost wages.
But -- but in terms of the balance that’s been

2

3

struck by Congress, you have this -- this lower amount

4

of — of benefits compared to what you might recover in

5

a tort situation.

6

get it quickly; you get it without regard to fault; you

7

get it

8

the same sort of balance that you do in the state

9

systems to which you refer.

Cn the other hand, you get it -- you

without the need for litigation.

10

New, there’s —

11

QUESTION:

12

13

and suffering.

Sc you strike

Well, nothing is recovered for pain

I mean that's clear, isn’t it?

MS. CORWINs

There is no amount of FICA

14

benefits that is measured according to someone's

15

recovery for pain and suffering.

16

There is also — there is no indication in the

17

language of either differentiation among different types

18

of damages or any suggestion that the right of

19

reimbursement, the federal governments* right as against

20

the third party recovery of the employee, no suggestion

21

that that depends in. any way on the substance or the

22

nature of the employee's cause of action.

23

The bottom line is when we read

24

anything you recover is then subject to this federal

25

right of reimbursement.
10

8131 is that

1

Now, Respondent has suggested that 8132 is

2

merely an adjunct to Section 8131 which provides that

3

the Secretary may require the employee to assign his

4

right of action to the Secretary to the United States.

5

In fact, we think the two sections create scmewhat

6

different kinds of rights.

7

Section 8131 for guidance, we think our interpretation

8

ought to prevail.

9

But even if you do look to

The Secretary may require an assignment of the

10

right cf action, not just the employee's right tc

11

recover for medical expenses and lost wages.

12

assignment would work is that the Secretary, if he

13

received an assignment, would recover any available

14

damages, and that would include not only medical

15

expenses and lost wages, but pain and suffering cr

16

punitive damages or anything else the employee himself

17

might recover.

18

The way

Then at that point the Secretary would take

19

away from the recovery the amount that was necessary to

20

compensate the — the fund for all the FICfl benefits

21

that had been paid out.

22

were some excess left ever would that amount be paid to

23

the employee.

24
25

And only after that if there

Now, that's -- that's qualified by the
one-fifth prevision that came in in
11

1966, tut really the

1

principle behind it is that the -- really the — the

2

reimbursement of the compensation fund comes first under

3

either 8131 or 8132.
Now, the court skipped over the language of

4
5

the statute and moved directly to the legislative

6

purposes.

7

dismissed the language so summarily, but again, even if

8

you do look at Congress' purposes, I think again they

9

support our reading of the statute.

We don’t think the court should have

I don’t think there can be any question that

10
11

the primary purpose of the provisions for third party

12

actions and for reimbursement under FICA are to shift a

13

part of the cost of the program to negligent third party

14

tort feasors; that is. Congress made the judgment that

15

if there was a negligent third party in the scene

16

whenever there was a wcrk-telated accident, it was that

17

tort feasor that ought to bear the costs of those

18

particular compensation benefits as opposed to the

19

taxpay ers.

20
21

22

Now, various members of Congress expressed
concern about the expense of the program back in 1916.
QUESTI0N4

May I ask a question right there?

23

As I understand the way this works out, the injured

24

employee bears at least four-fifths of the cost of the

25

lost wages and medical benefits, and the third party
12

1

just bears the expense cf the pain and suffering.
NS. CORWIN;

2

Well, the — the employee always

3

gets the FICA benefits.

4

the system.
QUESTION;

5

I mean that is a given within

Right.

But he, in effect, has had

6

to pay four-fifths of those benefits to the government

7

out of

8

that right?

the recovery he got for pain and suffering, is

NS. CORWIN;

9
10

depending on how the numbers worked out --

11

QUESTION;

12

MS. CORWIN;

13

Well -- well, in this case.
No.

Here the employee got mere

than four-fifths of his own recovery.
QUESTION;

14
15

Well, depending on the situation,

No.

#

But the £8,500 was for pain

and suffering, wasn't it?

16

NS. CORWIN;

17

QUESTION;

That's correct.
And out of that amount he had to

18

reimburse the government for the wages and medical

19

expens e.

20

KS. CORWIN;

21

QUESTION;

That's correct.
So that he is the one who

22

ultimately bore the cost of the wages and medical

23

expense in this case.

24

NS. CORWIN;

25

Well, of course — cf course, he

had received the FICA benefits before and was merely
13

1

paying them back.

I mean the bottom line is he always

2

gets an amount that’s equal to the FICR benefits.

3

may or may not --

4

QUESTIONj

5

MS. CORWIN:

Well, but —
He may cr may net get the bonus

6

on top of that.

7

scheme, he always receives the FICA benefits.

9

MS. CORWIN;

14

15

Well, I think he may have and the

government reimbursed him through the FICA benefits.
QUESTION;

12
13

Well, somebody had to pay the

hospital bill to start with, and I assume he did.

10
11

Eut as to the statutory compensation

QUESTION;

8

He

government.

Right.

And then he reimbursed the

So at the bottom line is that he paid them

out of his own assets, and one of those assets was his
recovery for pain and suffering, isn’t that correct?

16

just want to be sure I understand it.

17

debate whether it’s just cr fair cr anything.

18

that’s what happened, isn't it?

19

MS. CORWIN:

I'm not trying to
But

Well, in that that $8,500 was

20

denominated pain and suffering and yes, part of that

21

went to recompense the FICA benefits.

22

him with quite a bit left over.
QUESTION;

23

I

That still left

Does it also include loss of wages

24

and special damages, other special damages — the third

25

party —
14

KS. CORWIN;

1

The third party recovery in this

2

case we have agreed represents pain and suffering, and

3

that is because of the unusual situation that's created

4

by the Pennsylvania no-fault statute.
CBESTICN:

5

Well, my question was addressed to

6

the general proposition.

7

against the third person, it is for the special damages;

8

that is, medical expenses, loss of wages, pain and

9

suffering.

10

When the recovery is had

It's a whole range of things making up his

total injury, is it not?

11

MS. CORWIN;

In many cases that would be sc.

12

Now, the "unfairness" or anomaly that comes in

13

here is created because on top of the federal scheme,

14

the federal statutory compensation scheme, there is

15

overlaid the state nc-fault insurance scheme, and within

16

that scheme the state has chosen to abolish tort

17

liability for these medical expenses and lost wages

18

below a certain amount.
For that reason the settlement or a third

19
20

party recovery in -- in the Pennsylvania situation would

21

not include elements like medical expenses and lost

22

wages.

23

unusual or anomalous about that, I think it -- it's

24

attributable to what the state has come along and dene

25

in the face of the established federal program.

But — but to the extent that there is something

15

QUESTION;

1

Well, as I said, I wasn't debating

2

the fairness cf it; tut the net result cf it is that he

3

pays his own hospital till.

4

NS. CORWIN;

5

QUESTION;

6

MS. CORWIN;

7

If he had one.
I mean you can -- you can shift

around the money however you want.
QUESTION;

8
9

Well, I — it depends on -- cn --

Well, tut it isn’t shifting around,

because the $8,500 I thought you stipulated none cf that

10

is attributable to either wages or — or medical

11

expense.

I mean do we accept that or don't we?

12

MS. CORWIN:

13

QUESTION;

14
15
16

Well, we have accepted that.
And if we accept it,

doesn't it

follow he paid his own hospital bill?
MS. CORWIN;

One could regard it that way.

One could also say —

17

QUESTION;

18

MS. CORWIN;

Well, one must regard it, don't we?
One could also say he came out

19

with — with the medical expenses and the lost wages

20

plus something on top cf that as a result of the third

21

party recovery.

22

QUESTION;

Well, but only if you say the

23

$8,500 includes medical expenses and lest wages.

24

assuming there’s an element of profit in recovering on

25

pain and suffering.

16

You're

MS. CORWIN;

1

Well, I suggest that -- that

2

Congress when it was structuring the federal

3

compensation scheme was focusing on what was necessary

4

to be fair tc the employee tc give him a recovery for a

5

work-related injury, and that amount is measured by the

6

FICA benefits.
Now, if there’s a third party tort feasor in

7
8

the picture, you may also get something, but the

9

condition within the statutory scheme is that you first

10

apply that to compensate the government.
QUESTIONS

11

12

case if instead of $8,500 it was $1,500?

13

NS. CCRWINs

14

QUESTION;

15

Well, Ns. Corwin, what would be the

Then -Then what’s his obligation to

reimburse?
MS. CORWINs

16

His obligation under the plain

17

language of the statute is tc reimburse the federal

18

government for the FICA benefits.

19

QUESTION4

20

MS. CCRWINs

21

QUESTION;

22

25

The whole $1,600.
All right.

The FICA benefits were

$1,800 or $1,600, was it?
MS. CORWINs

23
24

Well, the whole $1 ,500 --

Sixteen hundred was the FICA

benef i ts.
QUESTION:

Well, then, let me change that from
17

1

51/500 tc

2

if the $8,500 was $1,600, he*d have to pay it back.

3

Then Justice Stevens* question would have tc be answered

4

yes, he paid his own hospital bills, wouldn’t it?
Well, I don’t think so.

I think

the government initially —
QUESTION:

7
8

go if it had been -- if he’d got —

MS. CORWIN:

5
6

51*600.

Well, if he gave it back, he

wouldn’t have anything, would he?
MS. CORWIN:

9

He -- well, he would come out

10

with one-fifth, because in

11

the employee would always get at least cne-fifth of some

12

third party recovery.

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. CORWIN:

15

QUESTION:

16

I see.
So the bottom line is —
So -- so he’d get $300 odd dollars

MS. CORWIN:

18

least one-fifth.

19

one-fifth.

Well, yes.

He -- he would get at

Now, here he got plenty more than

MS. CORWIN:

or something.

He’s paid the $1,6C0 hospital till.
Well, the government initially

paid it.
QUESTION:

Yes.

24

the government.

25

up with a net of $300.

And then he got 51*600 from

Now he’s giving back $1,300, so he ends
And he certainly pays the
18

1

difference, $1,300 of the hospital bill, doesn't he?
NS. CORWIN;

2

Well, I think it's a matter cf

3

characterization, and I think that one has to start cut

4

from the premise that when Congress was setting up this

5

federal compensation scheme that it felt that the -- the

6

proper result was that the employee should get FICA

7

benefits.

8

tort liability system.

9

without regard to fault, he got them without litigation.

These were benefits that took the place cf a
He got them quickly, he got them

Now, to the extent that there was a third

10
11

party in the picture, Congress concluded that that third

12

party as opposed to the taxpayer to be bearing the ccst

13

of the compensation benefits paid out.

14

have to assume that that is -- that is the primary

15

purpose; that is the purpose reflected in the debates on

16

this measure.
QUESTION;

17
18

MS. COEWIN;

QUESTION;

22

Well, if I were the injured

employee, I'd still feel I was $1,300 out of pocket.

21

And I think you

payments.

Well, I think that -Well, he has the compensation

He doesn't have to disgorge those.
MS. CORWIN;

Well, that's right, and that

23

really is the basis of the scheme.

24

that if you're in a work-related injury situation that

25

you get the compensation payments, you get the FICA

19

The assumption is

1

benefits, and that in itself is the solution under the

2

statutory compensation scheme.
Now — new, as I say, if there’s this third

4

party,

you may have something on top of that, but that’s

5

not necessarily so.

6

QOESTIONi

Ms. Ccrwin, perhaps ycur opponent

7

can speak with more authority than you can on this, tut

8

under the Pennsylvania statute, granted you can only sue

9

for basically pain and suffering, but isn’t there some

10

administrative provision or some provision for ycur own

11

carrier, your own insurance carrier to pay lost wages

12

and specials?
MS. CORWIN:

13

There -- the way the Pennsylvania

14

scheme works would prevent in this situation no-fault

IS

being

16

the — any obligation of the no-fault, the first party

17

no-fault insurer, Respondent's own insurer, is reduced

18

by the amount of workers' compensation or other

19

government benefits that the employee receives.

20

-- benefits being paid.

QUESTION:

The way it works is that

So an employee of a private

21

employer here who couldn’t claim workmen’s compensation

22

could have claimed something from the first insurer, but

23

because he was covered, this guy was covered by FICfl ,

24

this person couldn’t.

25

MS. CORWIN:

No.

I don’t think there’s -20

1

there's not a difference in the two situations you

2

suggest.

3

system would -- would he forced first to get his

4

workers’ compensation, and the no-fault carrier wouldn’t

5

have to pay anything to the extent the workers’

6

compensation carrier had done so under the state system.

The individual who’s employed in the private

QUESTIONS

7

But if it’s an injury not arising

8

out of

9

workmen's compensation , no FICA , then under Pennsylvania

10

in the course of employment and there is no

law the first liability carrier has to pay specials?
MS. CORWIN:

11

That is correct.

Then — then

12

you would recover it from your first party insurer,

13

that’s correct.
QUESTION*

14

Ms. Corwin, in a — in a state

15

without no-fault or without some system like

16

Pennsylvania’s and you sue the third party, you can

17

recover anything you can get out of them.

18

Justice Brennan’s example, if you recovered from a third

19

party only $1,500, and you’d only been paid $1,500,

20

you’re going to have to refund the whole thing.

21

MS. CORWIN:

22

QUESTION:

And if in

Well, that -- that's correct.
I mean whether that’s — whatever

23

the recovery is.

And so this case, just because it

24

involved recovery of pain and suffering, doesn’t present

25

any unique problem.
21
*

MS. CORWIN*

1
2

Well, it's net unique in that you

may always end up having to pay everything back.

3

QUESTION*

4

MS. CORWIN:

Yes.
That's a condition of — of being

5

in the compensation system.

6

situations like settling for less than you had claimed.

7

QUESTION*

8

MS. CORWIN:

9

You may also have

Yes.
Or being in a comparative

negligence state and having your recovery reduced in

10

which you — you would have the reimbursement really go

11

into the other parts of your damages award.

12

something I think that Congress was — was clearly aware

13

of.

14

you had things like there -- there was a specific

15

reference to settlement in the statute, so Congress was

16

clearly aware that you might end up with -- with less

17

than -- than all of your damages on each element.

18

And that's

I mean you didn’t have no-fault back in 1916, tut

There were -- in the Senate debates there were

19

references to comparative negligence on several

20

occasions, so they again recognized that that sort of

21

principle might be at work.

22

no expression of concern about protecting those elements

23

of damages like pain and suffering from this federal

24

right to reimbursement.

25

But there was -- there was

New, there -- there was some concern about
22

1

protecting the damages from any credit against

2

compen sation for some future injury.

3

well,

4

what t hey call it, hanging over the employee sc that he

5

would have to apply all of his recovery sometime in the

6

future ; but he didn't — he didn't know it — it would

7

possib ly happen to him some day.

we don't — we don't want a sword of Eamccles, is

So they -- they put in some language that said

8
9

Congress said

this r ight of reimbursement doesn *t extend beyond that

10

same i njury; but there was no effort to -- to protect

11

any of these elements of damages from this — what

12

appear s to be an absolute right of recovery.
Now, I’d just like to briefly mention another

13
14

consid eration we think underlies the statute, and that

15

is, Co ngress’ intent to create a — a uniform and

16

man age able system that can be administered on a

17

nation wide basis.
We've pointed out in our brief the

18
19

admini strative difficulties we think the sort of test

20

fashio ned by the court of appeals would present.

21

don *t think that Congress has indicated anywhere that --

22

that i t anticipated that the Secretary would be making

23

this s ort of state-by-state adjustment of federal

24

rights .

25

t hink

I

And in the absence of that indication, I don't

it’s appropriate to read it into the statute.
23

Now, the court of appeals thought it was

1
2

signif icant that reimburse™ ent was not necessary here in

3

order to prevent double rec every.

4

-- tha t Congress may have h ad this prevention cf double

I don’t dispute that

That was net th e only purpose of the

I think the point was to put the -- the less

the compensation system, whenever it was possible.

12

Congress had wanted to focus on this double recovery

If

rationale, I think it could have drafted the statute in
a much more limited manner.
Now, ultimately the court of appeals and

15
16

Respondent fall back on their own conceptions cf

17

fairness to federal employees and on the -- the ideas

18

about parity between federal employees and ethers.

19

think I’ve pointed out that in our view it is

20

Pennsylvania that has come along and imposed upon the

21

FICfl system a different set cf adjustments cf rights and

22

has created this sort of situation.

Their legislature

We think they could do it by construing

their statute in the courts.

Pennsylvania doesn’t take care of this, I think that it

is the burden of Congress to adjust any rights if it

perceives that this is an unfair situation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES SOVEL, ESQ.,

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESFCNEENT
MR. SOVEL;

17
18

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
Under the Pennsylvania no-fault system when a

19
20

person is injured, he’s entitled to collect his basic

21

benefits from his own insurance carrier.

22

benefits are medical expenses and a portion of wage

23

loss.

24

$1,C00 a month.

25

compensation benefits,

Those basic

compensation benefits, and the amount paid by the

vorkme n's compensation carrier pays.

4

the ef feet cf that is tc reduce the figure to zero sc

5

that t he man receives his workmen's compensation wage

6

loss a nd his medical expenses from his employer.

7

In most instances

The statute specifically provides and the

8

courts of Pennsylvania have so held that the workmen's

9

compen sation carrier cannot assert a right cf

10

subrog ation in the third party action.

11

action , therefore, is limited to items of damages net

12

covere d by the no-fault benefit, and the no-fault

13

benef i t in turn is the workmen's compensation benefit.

14

The third party

New, in effect, ycu have a new type of

21

22

Instead of what .

The effect of the government's position here

23

is to deny the person that single recovery which is

24

contem plated by state law.

25

contem plated by state law is a no-fault benefit plus a

The single recovery

27

right to sue a third party.

The government is saying

out of that single right we're going to reduce that

medical expenses that you have received.

Now, when Congress enacted —

20

that.

21

damages, any damages recoverable under that particular

23

The statute just says damages.
