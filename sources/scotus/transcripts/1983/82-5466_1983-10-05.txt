ORAL ARGUMENT OF GORDON B. BALDWIN, ESP-»

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6
7

MR. BALDWIN;
please the Court;

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

This is an exigent circumstances case.

On

that proposition I think there is agreement between the
State and the Defendant.
The issue in this case is whether an exigent

11
12

circum stances doctrine will justify the arrest of the

13

Defendant in his home.

14

calling Fourth Amendment standards upheld the right cf

The Wisconsin Supreme Court

15 police without a warrant and without establishing
16

consent to enter a home at night to arrest the

17

householder for a traffic offense that was not committed

18

in the officer's presence.
QUESTION;

19
20
21

You said at night.

About what time

was it?
ME. BALDWIN;

The officer reportedly heard the

22

call at 8;49 p.m.

There was some dispute as to how long

23

it took the officer to get to the house.

24

generally agreed it is about 9;00.

25

week before we would have gone on to daylight savings

I think it is

That was about a

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

time so it was dark.

2

The Wisconsin Supreme Court justified the

3

traffic arrest applying its traffic arrest statute, and

4

it held

5

arrest.

that exigent circumstances justified the
It did so for three reasons; first, that the

6 arrest was justified by a hot pursuit doctrine;
7

secondly, that the Defendant who as I said was arrested

8

in his home in his bedroom constituted a possible threat

9

to public safety; and third, that the arrest was

10

necessary in order to secure evidence of possible

11

intoxication.

12

Now on the facts we do not knew exactly what

13

the arresting officer knew.

14

relied on an eye witness who saw a car driven

15

erratically, crossed in front of oncoming traffic and

16

stopped or got stuck in an open field or cemetery.

17

QUESTION;

The arresting officer

When ycu said at the outset that

18

this was truly an exigent circumstances case, did you

19

mean that the exigent circumstance is the need of the

20

officers to apprehend this gentleman while he might

21

still be subject to a breathalyzer test or observation?

22

MR. BALDWIN;

The officers justified, Mr.

23

Chief Justice, the entry into the home as required by

24

the need to obtain a blood-alcohol test, Officer Daley

25

said, within two hours of the event to be proved.

a

2

QUESTION;

In other words to preserve

evidence.

3

MR. BALDWIN;

This was to preserve — As

4

Officer Daley said, yes, to preserve evidence of

5

intoxication he felt he had to enter the home under

6

those circumstances.

The officer had been called by a

7 passing motorist and spoke to the eye witness.

8
9

We do not knew exactly what the eye witness
said,

but there is a discrepancy between what the eye

10

witness testified on the stand where he said he thought

11

that the errant driver was either drunk or sick and what

12 the officer said he said.

The officer said he received

13

the opinion that the errant driver was definitely

14

intoxicated.

15

There was a difference.

My point is that we would know what the

16

arresting officer knew or thought if we had a warrant

17

applied for during the course of that next hour or so.

18

The officer did

19

home which was-about half a mile away, went quickly to

20

the home, knocked on the doer.

21

trace the automobile to the Defendant's

That is clear.

What happened at the doer is in dispute

22

because the sixteen-year-old step-daughter who answered

23

the knock was not available to testify when this hearing

24

occurred about two years later.

25

upstairs to the bedroom where he encountered Edward

QUESTION*

Did the Circuit Court make any

finding as to whether it had been consent?

4

ME. BALDWIN*

The Circuit Court explicity said

5

we do not examine the question of consent.

6

rationale was that the witnesses who are relevant to the

Its

7 question of consent were not then available.

8

The Circuit Court held. Judge Frankel held

9

that the exigent circumstances doctrine including the

10

hot pursuit doctrine justified this pursuit and entry

11

into the home.

12
13

QUESTION*

The Supreme Court of Wisconsin

likewise did not pass cn the issue of consent?
ME. BALDWIN*

14

The Supreme Court of Wisconsin

15

likewise said that the exigent circumstances doctrine

16

justified excusing the warrant and consent requirement.

17

The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, however, had reversed

18

the trial court because there was nc finding of

19

consent.

20

of four votes to two found that consent was not

21

necessary to be shown in this case.

In turn, the Wisconsin Supreme Court by a vote

22

QUESTION*

Did the officer know the man?

23

MR. BALDWIN*

The officer testified that he

24

had remembered the name from an incident that happened

25

he said a week or two before --

Actually it probably

That is what we have in the record.

QUESTION;

8

It did not say anything

He did not know that he drove the

car?
NR. BALDWIN;

He obviously was highly

11

suspicious, of course, sure.

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. BALDWIN;

I beg your pardon?
He was highly suspicious that

14

the car had been driven by the owner, and the owner, of

15

course, is the Defendant in this case.

16
17

QUESTION;

He did not know.

You mean that every car on the

street is driven by the owner?

18

MR. BALDWIN;

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. BALDWIN;

Ch, no.

Ch, no.

What —
The officer was suspicious.

21

There is n'o question about it.

If, for example, Hr.

22

Justice Marshall, if the officer had encountered my

23

client on the door steps of the home, we do not deny

24

that there would have been a right to stop, investigate,

25

question and if the officer found evidence of

1

intoxication to make an arrest.

2

That is a possibily.

We do not deny that.

3

But we do contest the right of the officers —

The law must be different in your

I thought the crime, a misdemeanor was committed
the presence cf a police officer.

Is that the law in Wisconsin?

8

ME. BALDWIN:

9

common law, Mr. Justice Marshall.

10
11

QUESTION:

You had to

That is unquestionably the

My question is what is the law in

Wiscon sin?

12

ME. BALDWIN:

13

QUESTION:

I regret --

Does the policeman on a story that

14

somebody tells him have a right to go and lock up a

15

man?

Is that the law in Wisconsin?
MR. BALDWIN:

16

The Wisconsin law apparently

17

from the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s opinion does net

18

require that there be an in-presence offense in order to

19

arrest for a misdemeanor.

20

The legislative history is obscure, but prior to 1971 —
’QUESTION:

21
22

23
24
25

The law was changed in 1971.

Does the law say he could break the

door down?
MR. BALDWIN:

Absolutely net, sir.

There is

nothing in the law saying you enter.
It is cur contention that the exigent

circumstances doctrine shou Id not apply for a

2 misdemeanor or minor offens
3

QUESTION 4

e.

Kr• Ba ldwin, would you say that is

4

true if the officer had per sonally observed your client

5

behind

the «heel and doing erratic driving and had

6 observed all of

the circuits tances and had had to chase

7 him to the house in an effo rt to apprehend him?
8

Could

the officer have followed h im inside to make the arrest
in your view?

10

ME. BALDWINS

The answer I give to that.

11

Justice O'Conner is no as long as it is a minor

12

off ense .

13

failur e to stay at the scene of an accide nt, far more

14

serious and could even be a felony in the State of

15

Wisconsin, then the case for a hot pursuit and entry

If an off ense had occurred, for example

10 would be permissible.
17
18
1

It is our belief that the bright line, if you
will, is at the door of the house for a minor offense.
QUESTION s

Do you think it should make a

20 difference from state to state as to how the state
21

chooses to classify an offense?

22

driving might be made a felony and in another a

23

misdemeanor.

24

purposes of the Fourth Amendment?

25

In one state drunk

Does it make any real differences for

NR. BALDWIN*

Yes, Justice O'Conner, I believe

c

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

it does for two reasons, and I think, they are

2

illustrated by the law of Wisconsin.

3

that reasonableness under Fourth Amendment standards

4

requires a balancing of the actual governmental interest

5 asserted to justify invasion.
6

governmental interest?

7

legislature.

8
9

The first point is

What is the actual

That is determined by the

The legislature may view some offenses more
seriously than other states balanced against the

10

seriousness of the intrusion.

11

into a highly protected place where expectations of

12

privacy are greatest.

13

Here it is an intrusion

The second reason may be as in Wisconsin the

14

state wishes to define reasonableness or define whether

15

or not it has jurisdiction where an arrest has occurred

16

under questionable circumstances.

17

QUESTION;

Well, it makes it very difficult,

18

does it not, for an officer in a jurisdiction where it

19

would be a misdemeanor if there had been no prior

20

conviction but it would be a felony if there had and the

21

officer does not know that and he does not knew whether

22

he has to stop at the doer cr not?

23

kind of a difficult line to be drawn.

24
25

fcB. BALDWIN;

That strikes me as

It is a difficult line, but it

is a difficult line because the legislature of Wisconsin

10
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

has drafted its driving while intoxicated statutes in

2

that particular way.

3

QUESTION';

Hr. Baldwin, I think the offense in

4

Schmerber v. California was also a misdemeanor and yet

5

the court there said

6

for taking the sum from him by blood.
HR. BALDWIN;

7
8

that exigent circumstances existed

absolutely correct.

Justice Rehnquist, you are

The charge in Schmerber was for a

9 misdemeanor, but as I read Schmerber and I think it is
10 in a footnote the underlying act could have been charged
11

as a felony at the time by the arresting officer.

12

The second point is -- Excuse me.

13

QUESTION;

14

HR. FALDWIN;

15

QUESTION;

16

So could it here.
So could it here?

Yes, if he had known that he had a

prior arrest.
HR. BALDWIN;

17

If he had known there had been a

18 prior arrest, then I would have to rely on the exigent
19

circumstances doctrine and I could not make this

20 assertion that the exigent circumstances doctrine should
21
22

not apply to an arrest for a minor offense.
'

QUESTION;

Hr. Baldwin, could I ask you what

23 were you complaining about when you appealed?
24

The

reason your client had been hurt is that his driver's

25 license had been revoked.

That is shat you were really

complaining about.

4

MS. BALDWIN:

QUESTION:

That is the --

Is that not — So that the end

result that you wanted to attain in the state courts was

that the driver's license would be restored.

MR. BALDWIN:

21

You want to say that the Fourth

Amendment barred the use of this evidence?
MR. BALDWIN:

19
20

This Court does not have to

apply the exclusionary rule, vr. Justice White.

17
18

Well, have we ever applied the

exclusionary rule to a civil proceeding?

15
16

It is most certainly a civil

proceeding.

14

Is the revocation procedure not a

civil proceeding?

That is correct, sir.

White —
QUESTION:

You want to say that this refusal

and taking him down to the station was a fruit of an

23

illegal entry and that is what your argument is.

is a Fourth Amendment argument to save your driver's

25

license in a civil proceeding.

QUESTION:

10

I agree with you.
There must be an arrest.

I agree with you, but nevertheless

it is a civil proceeding.
MR. BALDWIN:

The State of Wisconsin viewed

this as a criminal-type proceeding.

who found that the refusal —

QUESTION:

The hearing judge

I know tut that cannot control the

application of the Fourth Amendment.

I do not know why

I agree with you, but we are

HR. BALDWIN*

Mr. Justice White, the

It is an exclusionary rule required by the law

Amendment grounds.
QUESTION!

10
11

But you are up here on Fourth

The Wisconsin Supreme Court has

ruled against you on every conceivable state ground you

12 could have so you must be here on a
13

federal ground.

I,

too, like Justice White had thought you were making a

14 claim under the exclusionary rule of the Fourth
15
16
17

Amendment.
NR. BALDWIN!

It seems to me. Justice

Rehnquist, that the issue here is the reasonableness of

18 an arrest which is not a question of necessarily the
19 introduction of
20
21

the evidence.

It is the reasonableness

of an arrest.
'QUESTION!

You are'not interested in that in

22

the abstract are you?

23

the evidence that arose out of the arrest.

24
25

MR. BALDWIN!

You are interested in suppressing

The suppression rule was simply

a product of the law cf Wisconsin.

may have contained an abstractly wrona proposition of

12

the federal Constitution but the result was right.

13

ME. BALDWIN*

Well, the Wisconsin Supreme

14

Court has construed an arrest as lawful under Fourth

15

Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment standards.

18

what the Wisconsin Supreme Court has said about the

It is

17 arrest criteria is why we are here.
18

QUESTIONS

Eut you have to be here because of

19 something that-is done about the criteria not because of
20

what it said about it.

21

ME. BALDWIN*

Well, the consequence, of

22 course, of the lawful arrest was the loss of driving
23

privileges and, of course, incidentally the introduction

24

into evidence of the officer’s testimony of what he saw

25

in the bedroom in the criminal case which , of course ,

The exclusionary rule which is a product

2 remedial device of the Fourth Amendment is not before
3

this Court.
What is before this Court is the lawfulness of

4
5

an arrest of the Defendant in his bedroom without

6

consent and without warrant for a traffic offense net

7 committed in the officer’s presence.

If the exigent

8

circum stances doctrine applies it is our belief that the

9

facts do not justify its application here.

ORAL ARGUMENT CF STEPHEN W. KLEINMAIER, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. KLEINMAIER;
please the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

As indicated by the Petitioner the State in
this case relies on the exigent circumstances doctrine

7 which established the reasonableness of a warrantless
8

entry under that doctrine the warrantless entry to

9

arrest or to search^that he made if the police possessed

10 probable cause and exigent circumstances.

In this case the primary exigent circumsta nees

11
12

relied upon by the state is the need to obtain evidence

13

before it is lost.

14

arrest him for drunk driving and as the Court has

The police were after Mr. Welsh to

15 indicated in Schmerber in a

case for drunk driving or

intoxication offense the evidence will dissipate

17 gradually in the blood and ever a period of time will

Therefore, there was a need to immediately

as possible.

obtaining a warrant during a delay even if not all

would have been a period of some dissipation of the

It is also important because there is no way

Officer Daley

Ers. Welsh testified.
Then in the separate proceeding challenging

the reasonableness of the refusal there was a question

raised as to the arrest.

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. KLEINMAIER:

Well, that is this proceeding.
That is this proceeding new.

15

All the parties and the court relied on the transcript

16

and the findings from the drunk driving case to rule on

17 the legality of
18
19

the arrest for purposes of the

reasonableness hearing.
QUESTION;

Do I correctly understand that if

20

the arrest was unlawful whether for state reasons or

21

federal reasons that as a matter of state law the

22

refusal to take the test could not have been put into

23

evidence if the arrest was unlawful?

24
25

ME. KLEINKAIER;

In this proceeding where it

is to revoke his license the police officer is not

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

entitled to order him cr request a breathalyzer unless

2 he has first legally arrested him.
3

Sc I think there is

a matter of state law.

4

The Wisconsin courts have taken a position

5

that the legality of the arrest depends net only on

6

satisfying Wisconsin arrest statutes but on satisfying

7

Fourth

8

Amendment requirements.
QUESTION;

So you agree that the Wisconsin

Supreme Court was required to decide the federal

10

constitutional question in order to dispose of the

11

case?

12
13

NR. KLEINKAIER;

I would like to be able to

take the other position —

14

QUESTION;

15

NR. KLEINNAIFR;

But it would not be sound.
I do not believe so.

I think

16

the other one is that they incorporated the Fourth

Amendment as one of their criteria in determining the

18

legality of the arrest.

NR. ELEINNAIER;

On the exigent circum stances

I think another reason that —
QUESTION;

Before you go into the exigent

22

circum stances is the inception of the concept of the

23

exigent circumstances affected by the observations of

24

the seriousness of his driving condition?

For example,

25 the witness Jablonic I think his name was said he had

4

KB. KLEIHKAIEB*

5

QUESTION:

6

7

Yes.

What impact does that have on the

whole picture of exigent circumstances?
MR. KLEINNAIER:

I think that would indicate

8

that at least Mr. Jablonic was concerned that this

9

person was quite intoxicated and that if he had returned

10

to his car, stayed in his car and tried to drive it some

11

more and gone back on the highway that in his condition

12

there may have been an accident especially since Nr.

13

Jablonic said he had seen the Petitioner go down the

14

wrong lane, the left lane, and coming head on towards

15

another car and at that point was able to veer off the

16

left before an accident.

17

that if he continued to drive he may not be so lucky the

18

next time which

19

least hr. Jablonic was concerned that something be done

20

about his condition as soon as possible.

21

would indicate that they wanted to cr at

But primarily —

7

QUESTION*

Is that evidence available for a

8 license cancellation proceeding?

9

MR. KLEIN M AIER s

Well, Mr. Welsh’s -- Yes, in

10 that his license could be suspended either through the
11

reasonableness hearing for refusing the breathalyzer or

12

as.a result of his conviction for drunk driving.

13
14

QUESTIONS

Just so I am clear on it I take it

here the license was suspended because of the refusal of

15 Mr. Welsh to take the breathalyzer or the blood
16

alcchol.

17

MR. KLEINMAIER;

18

QUESTION;

In this proceeding here, yes.

He asserted that his refusal was

19 reasonable because the arrest was unlawful.
20

MR. KLEINK AIEE:

21

QUESTION;

Yes, because —

Under Wisconsin law if the arrest

22

is unlawful is that treated as a reason for refusing to

23

take the test?

24

MR. KLEIN M AIER ;

Well, the trial judges

25 accepted that and the officer is not entitled to even

29
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

request him to take a breathalyzer until he has arrested

2

him in a valid arrest so that is a requirement before

3 even asking for the breathalyzer.

5

QUESTION:
does the record

When the officer was at the door

show that he was aware of Nr. Jablonic’s

6 statement in detail that he was afraid the driver was
7

going to kill soembody or was he just responding to the

telephone warning that the lady had given?

9

HE. XLEIKMAIEE:

No, Hr. Jablonic had stopped

10

his car to block Mr. Welsh from moving his.

call the police.
Presumably that person called the police

because the police did receive a call.

A policeman

15 responded to the call and went to talk first to Mr.

Jablonic who then related some information to the police

The police officer at that point also checked

18
19

the license plate on the car to obtain some

20

identification of the driver and at that point went to

21

the address listed to that person.

22 gotten
23
24

Sc before he had

to he house he had talked to Mr. Jablonic.
This Court in another drunk driving case in a

context of different issue has again recognized the need

25 for obtaining evidence of intoxication as soon as

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

possible.

2

then in order for the State to protect people from drunk

In the MacKey v.

Montrym. case the Court sail

3 drivers the State has to have the authority to obtain a
4

breathalyzer test for evidence of intoxication at the

5

earliest possible moment.

6

Again, that is simply what this officer said

7 he was trying to do.
8

That is why he went to the house

and did not try to get a warrant.

9

I think the exigent circumstances prong of

10

this to get into a house has been satisified with a need

11

to obtain this evidence.

12

cause which in this case the Petitioner says is not a

13

pro tlem .

14
15

The other prong is probable

So under those two tests it would appear that
the police were justified in going in the house.

10 However, as I understand Petitioner’s objection now is
17 that we cannot apply this exigent circumstances test
18

because drunk driving was net a felony and was net a

19 serious enough-offense.

Our first response to that on this major-minor

20
21

distinction is that drunk driving is a very serious

offense.

MR. KLEINMAIER:

I think

Does it suggest that your

In Wisconsin no.

that might be the only state where it is not.

6
7

-Is a first offense a crime?

MR. KLEINKA. IER;
question.

Well, yes.

They created this

I think there is also — They have pointed

10

out that they are still concerned about it enough that

11

they authorized an arrest without a warrant.

12

I think the Petitioner's theory draws a big

13

distinction between a felony and a misdemeanor and

14

apparently in this case had the Wisconsin legislature

15

really classified drunk driving as a felony we would not

16

be here.

17

legislative decision and if the State can act to justify

18

this arrest simply by classifying this as a felony I

19

think the State can also express its interest in this

20

offense through its arrest laws because if we are only

21

talking about reclassifying as a felony to justify the

22

arrest I think the State can classify as a misdemeanor a

In other words, he is leaving it up to a

23 forfeiture and in another chapter of

the statutes

24

authorize an arrest for misdemeanor or forfeiture on the

25

basis of probable cause which Wisconsin has done.

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-Q300

1

It has passed statutes changing the arrest law

Under the statutes the statute in

reasonable grounds to believe that the crime has been or

is that your court does not agree with you.

that the officers had probable cause to believe that the

offense had been committed, and on the basis of

that

17 probable cause they were authorized to make the arrest.

19

with misdemeanors and felonies classifying together

20

there is also the statute in the motor vehicle code —

opinion.

I could'not get it out of that

I got it out of the dissent.
VR. KLEINKAIER;

Well, the issue presented to

24

the Wisconsin Supreme Court was whether there were

25

exigent circumstances and whether there was probable

33

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

cause,

2

circumstances and with these two they made the arrest in

3

the context of this case.

4

misdemeanors and felonies are treated together because

5

they both fall within the definition of a crime.

6

The legislature has indicated that its

7

interest is that the police have the same arrest

8

authorities for a misdemeanor or for a felony.

9

motor vehicle code the statute provides that a law

and they found probable cause and exigent

In the criminal code

In the

10

enforcement officer may make an arrest for a traffic

11

regulation by a violation of traffic regulation if he

12

has reasonable grounds to believe that a violation has

13

occurred or is being committed.

14

It is parallel language so I think the

15

legislature has indicated that it wants the arrest

16

authority for its officers to be the same whether the

17 case involves a forfeiture or misdemeanor or a felony.
18

I think it has expressed its concern that way as opposed

19

to classifying•this as a felony.

20

I think just because it gives a drunk driver a

21

break by not calling it a felony does net necessarily

22

mean that it is not interested enough that it wants to

23

obtain convictions for this.

24
25

QUESTION;

It is not just giving them a break

by not calling it a felony.

It also does not have the

That is correct.

still getting a break by not having it classified that

way and it is still a decision.
QUESTIONS

It is one

T think another way is looking at how —

QUESTIONS

MR. KLEINMAIER;

Or enforcement of the laws.

14

Here I think they have indicated through their arrest

15

law which they have made the same for traffic

the crime be a misdemeanor cr a felony.

misdem eanor?

7

MB. KLEINMAIER:

Well, he would have to have

8

exigent circumstances to go with the probable cause.

9

think you cannot simply because he has probable cause to

10

believe a misdemeanor has occurred just as if a felony -

11

QUESTION;

I

Well, he had probable cause to

12

believe someone has committed a misdemeanor offense and

13

that the person is getting away and going into his home

14

to avoid arrest.

15

Is that enough?

MR. KLEINMAIER:

I think he has to under the

16

normal exigent circumstances it would require more than

17

just think he is going into his house to avoid the

18 arrest at that point.
19
20

21

QUESTION;

If he —
Does our Santana case not answer

that in the affirmative?
MR. KLEINMAIER;

Yes, if the officer saw the

22 offense being committed and merely followed a hot
23

pursuit theory.

If a third party reports to the officer

24 that a misdemeanor occurred
25

two days before and

just

because the person is in the house the officer I do not

think can walk in.

If he believed that the person was

2 going to get an airplane within the next 15 minutes and
3

fly to Alaska or to somewhere else then he has the other

4

exigent circumstance of fearing the suspect is going to

5

flee.
QUESTION:

6

Or if it were shooting birds out of

7

season and he thought that they were going to be eaten

8

in the next hour and a half they could go in and -MR. KLEIN MAIEE;

9

I think under that

10

qualification it is a reasonable probability that it is

11

going to occur.

12

as a reasonable probability.

He cannot just think of the possibility

QUESTION;

13

General, in Wisconsin is a police

14

officer entitled to shoot a misdemeanor who is trying to

15

run ?

16

MR. KLEINMAIER;

17

to that question.

18

statutory question --

I do not knew if there is any

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. KLEINMAIER;

21

authorities.

You said it was all the same.

QUESTION;

23

MR. KLEINMAIER;

25

Well, as far as arrest

The other --

22

24

I just do not know the answer

Oh, this is limited to arrest.
To arrest in the context of

probable cause.
I think this Court as far as in what type of

1

off ens es an officer may enter a home t o make an arrest

2

for ex igent circumstances has already indicated that the

3

ent ry can be made in the case of something less than a

4

felony .

I t hink in this case it also has to be

5 recogn ized this case is not simply just a
6

arrest

•

7

The case involves obviously a question of

8

search .

9

going to arrest the evidence.

10

question of

They needed to obtain evidence.

They were not

They searched coupled with arrest.

In the

11

Camara case which we have heard a lot about this

12

aftern ccn and have heard many times it involved a

13

misdem eanor.

14

case w as a misdemeanor.

15

A violation of the building code in that

The court held that the building inspector

16

normal ly needed a warrant to enter the home to check for

17

the bu ilding code violation.

However, the court said

18 that t he entry could be made without a

warrant if there

19 was pr obable cause and an emergency existed .
20

I think in the emergency language in that case

21

they a re referring to the same thing as exigent

22

circum stances.

Some of the cases cited in Camara for

23 the em ergency have also been cited in other cases under
24
25

the he ading of exigent circumstances.
The Camara case indicates that under the

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Fourth Amendment the police can enter a residence to

2 search for evidence of a misdemeanor if they possess
3

probable cause and exigent circumstances.

4

same type of case as here.
QUESTION;

5

It is the

What if you had a building code

8 violation and the police had the same degree of

reliable

7

evidence they had here but they were afraid the man was

8

about to fix it, could they break into the house to

9 arrest him before he fixed it because that would void
10

the evidence?
MB. KLEINMAIER;

11
12

Again, under the cases on

exigent circumstances it is more than just speculation

13 or fear by the police.
14 think

They are going to have to have I

a reasonable lead —
QUESTION;

15

Say they had fairly reliable

16 evidence that that was about to happen as they did
17 here.

We want to be sure to get a conviction.
MB. KLEINMAIER;

18

Euilding code violations I

19

think are somewhat different in that usually you enforce

20

the building code violation to cure the violation.

21

the threat of violation is going to cause the person to

If

22 cure the violation maybe it has already served its
23
24
25

purpose .
QUESTION;

Well, cf course, one might argue

that keeping this man in bed might have been the best

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

way to avoid the danger you are talking about.

2
3

MR. KLEINMAIFR;

However/ when the police

entered they did not know he was in bed.

4

QUESTION;

Well, anyway I gather that ycur

5

position is that exigent circumstances satisfied

6

sufficiently where there was possibility cf

7 disappearance of the alcohol.

8

MR. KLEINMAIER:

9

QUESTION;

That is correct.

You do not think you have to rely

10

on anything more than that do you?

11

MR. KLEINMAIER;

Basically no.

I think that

12

exigent circumstances doctrine applies; however, the

13

legislature happened to classify the offense on this

14

case.

15
16

I think that pretty well sums up the case
also.

17

Thank you.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

19

Do you have anything

further, Hr. Baldwin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GORDON B. BALDWIN, ESQ.,

21

ON BEHALF CF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

22

MR. BALDWIN;

I would like to answer Justice

23

Steven’s question insofar as I have been informed by the

24

principle counsel for Mr. Welsh.

25

jury trial in early 1582 at which his refusal to take

He was convicted at a

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the blood test was in evidence which is per mitted now

2 under South Dakota v. Neville.
3

Secondly, Officer Daley testified as to what

4

he saw in the bedroom and Mr. Jablonic test ified.

5

Jabonlic incidentally did not smell the err ant driver’s

6 breath.

Mr.

For one reason or another he did n ct smell it,

7 but the jury did convict.

One of the jurymen was the wife o f one of my

8

9

law students, and this is one of the source s of my

10 information.
11

Secondly, this Court has cons idered the

problem cf carnage cn the highways in a num ber of

12 instances, but I want to call your attentio n to and
13 remind
14

you of Craig v. Eoren, an interestin g case

because of the way Justice Brennan dealt wi th th e

15 problem of statistics which Oklahoma had sh own that

10 there was a very high probability or a high er
17 probability of drunken driving offenses com mitted by
18

young men than by younq women but that desp ite the

19 statistical features which were really quit e
20

overwhelming it did not justify a deprivati on of the

21

Fourteenth Amendment claim to equal protect ion.

22

Similarly this Court in South Dak eta v .

23

Neville in a footnote indicated that perhap s the blood

24

alcohol test would net have been appropriat ely taken or

25 would not have been appropriately mentioned in the case

41

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

if it had been forced upon the Defendant.

My point is

2

that this Court has recognized that in the tattle

3 against drunk drivers there still are Fourteenth
4
5

Amendment protections.
Similarly in Mi neey v.

Arizona this Court has

6 declined to find a murder scene exception.

My final

7 slogan and I think this is a helpful one is that
8

exigency is not the same as expediency.

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER.-

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
