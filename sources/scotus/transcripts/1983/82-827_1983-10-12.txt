Hr. Lynn, I think ycu

ORAL ARGUMENT CF ECEERT H. LYNN, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

HR. LYNN;

6

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

7 please the Court;

The issue presented in this case is does the

8
9 Fifth

Amendment to the United States Constitution

10

require suppression cf incriminating admissions tc a

11

rape murder made by an out of custody probationer to his

12

probation officer because that probation officer did not

13

first warn the probationer of his right not to

14 incriminate himself.
15

The Minnesota Supreme Court in a

divided opinion held solely as a matter of federal

16 constitutional law that the Fifth Amendment required
17 suppression of these admissions despite the fact that
18

Respondent did not claim the privilege at the time the

19 questions were asked.
20

Instead, the Minnesota Supreme Court relied

21

upon factors this Court has expressly rejected in at

22

least three cases those being the Beckwith, Hathiason

23

and Bayhiller cases.

A state court may not impose

24 greater restrictions as a matter of

federal

25 constitutional law where this Court specifically

3

refrains from doing so.
An understanding of the legal issues in this

2

3 case requires an understanding of the facts, and I would
4 like to briefly summarize those for the Court.

October

5

1974 a seventeen-year-old woman is raped and strangled

6

in Minneapolis.
Marshall Murphy, the Respondent in this case,

7
8

was a suspect, was interviewed at that time but was

9

never arrested and was never indicted.

September 1980

10

Respondent was placed on probation for the crime of

11

false imprisonment after a plea of guilty in that

12

matter .

13

The conditions of his probation included the

14

normal ones, that he report to his probation officer as

15

directed, that he be truthful to his probation officer

16 in all matters,
17

that he keep his probation officer

informed of what he is doing.

There was also a specific

18 condition of his probation that he attend a treatment
19
20

program for sexual offenders known as Alpha House.
His probation officer assigned was a woman

21

named Mara Widseth.

For the following year probationer,

22

Respondent in this case, and the probation officer met

23 on a monthly basis at the probation officer’s office at
24
25

times usually selected by Respondent.
In July of 1981 Respondent left the treatment

program.

2

office.

He was called into his probation officer's
They discussed the matter and she decided to

3 allow him to continue on probation despite the fact he
4

was no longer in the sexual offender treatment because

5

she felt he was doing well in other areas.
Then September 22, 1981 the probation officer

6

7 learned from a counselor at the Alpha House treatment
8 program that Respondent had

while in treatment at that

9 program made admissions or told people that he had once
10 committed a

murder several years before.

When the probation officer learned that

11

12

information, of course, she did not know whether that

13

was true or false simply that those words apparently

14

were said.

15

such case existed.

She did not go to the police to learn if any

She made no contact with any other

16

17 authorities.
18

She did after talking with her supervisor

decide that she should relay this information she had

19 learned to the police and she also decided she should
20

inform the Respondent probationer of her decision.
So on the 24th of September she sent him a

21
22

letter requesting that he come into her office to

23

discuss further treatment.

time --

25

QUESTIONS

She was concerned at that

Hr. Lynn, may I ask you a question

right there?

2

MR. LYNNs

Yes, sir.

3

QUESTIONS

At that point in the development of

4

events could she have lawfully told the police without

5

first talking to the probationer?

6

MR. LYNNs

There is a problem there, Your

7

Honor, unrelated to the facts here.

8

do with the confidentiality of the Alpha House treatment

9

program .
That information was lawfully transmitted to

10
11

That problem has to

her.

12

QUESTION :

For what purpo se?

13

MR. LYNNs

For the purpos e of monitoring his

Was the Alpha House not under a

pro bat ion.

16

restri ction which w ould have preven ted it from giving

17

inform ation to the police?

18

MR. LYNNs

It was, Your H onor, yes.

19

QUESTIONS

It could give that information to

her fo r the limited purpose of moni toring the treatment?

MB. LYNN

1

There is a substantial question as

2 to that. Your Honor, yes.
QUESTIONS

3
4

Mr. Lynn, these restrictions that

you just referred to in responding to Justice Stevens,

5 are those restrictions imposed by state law?
MR. LYNN;

6

Imposed by both, Your Honor.

The

7 Alpha House treatment program — This issue was
8

litigated below at the trial court level.

The Alpha

9

House treatment program is subject to certain federal

10

regulations dealing with alcohol chemical dependency

11

treatm ent.

12
13

There is also a state statute dealing with
confidentiality.

The trial court ruled that one or both

14 of these statutes acted to prevent that information from
15 going to anyone other than the probation officer.
16

QUESTIONS

What did — Did the Supreme Court

17 of Minnesota pass on that question?
18
19

MR. LYNN;

They did not, Your Honor.

That

issue was not on appeal.

20

QUESTION;

So it is not before us either.

21

MR. LYNN;

I believe not. Your Honor.

22

QUESTION;

Mr. Lynn, if when the probation

23 officer questioned the Respondent he had refused to
24 answer on grounds that his answer might incriminate him
25

could Minnesota have revoked his probation for his

7

1 refusal to answer?
2

MF . LYNNi

I believe not, Your Honor.

As we

3 discuss in our brief in this matter had he validly or
4 had he claimed his Fifth Amendment privilege when this
5 issue was discussed it is my interpretation of the
Q rulings and decisions of this Court in such cases as
7 Lefkowitz v. Turley, Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, Garrity
8 and others that he could not be sc punished.
9

’

He could not be revoked for invoking the Fifth

10 Amendment validly.
11
12

In other words, that would be a

valid defense.
I do not believe that issue has been litigated

13 in the Minnesota Supreme Court, but I believe in any
14 event it is bound by the decisions in this Court.
15

QUESTION!

You would conced that in making

16 your argument?
17

MR. LYNNi

Yes, Your Honor.

18

In any event then after this lettter was sent

19

to the probationer a meeting was set up September 28th,

20 again at a time chosen by Respondent at the office he
21

had been to approximately 12 times before.

The

22 probation officer began that interview by telling
23 Respondent exactly what she had learned from the Alpha
24

House treatment program, that is, that he had made these

25

comments about a murder and that she felt he needed

8

further about further treat ment.

9

did not directly ash Murphy about this murder, did net

The probation officer

10 directly confront him, neve r threatened to revoke him,
11

simply posited the position that she felt based on what

12

she had learned that he nee ded further treatment.

13

Respondent denied

that.

He did that by first

14

denying the false imprisonm ent charge for which he was

15

in probation.

16

further that at the time of this rape murder he had teen

17

involved with drugs quite h eavily and that since he was

18

no longer involved with dru gs the two incidents were

19

unrelated behaviorally.

20

He claimed i nnoncence, and he said

The probation off icer confronted him with his

21

guilt on the false imprison ment charge and at that point

22

without further prodding by this probation officer

23

Respondent went ahead and i n some detail described the

24

1974 murder.

At that point the probation officer

25 informed him she would have to take

this information to

the police
Respondent commented that he understood that

2
3

but that unless he confessed tc the police it would

4

simply be her word against his.

5

turn himself in.

She encouarged him to

He asked for time to do so.

6

At that point he

7

began to cry.

He said he committed the ultimate sin.

8

After some moments of composing himself he walked cut of

9

her office unimpeded and left the building.
Two days later — The probation officer took

10
11

no action for two days.

Two days later Respondent

12

called and said he had contacted an attorney.

13

decided not to turn himself in and it was two days after

14

that,

15

that Respondent was arrested and later charged and

16

indicted with first degree murder.

He had

in other words, four days after these admissions

The Fifth Amendment to the United States

17
18

Constitution says no more nor no less than no person

19

shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness

20

against himself .
QUESTIONS

21

Mr. Lynn, before you get into ycur

22 argument, may I ask a sequel to the question Justice
23

O'Connor asked?

You said that if he claimed the

24

privilage he could not have had his parole revoked at

25

that time.

Supposing he were asked not about something

10

_

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

that happened prior to the institution of parole but

2 about something that went on during parole,

they asked

3

him to report what he had been doing and whether he

4

violated any of the conditions of parole.

5

could he refuse to answer those questions and claim the

In your view

6 privilege and still not have his parole revoked?

HR. LYNN;
distinction.

Your Honor, I would make a

If the questions asked had to do with

9 perhaps noncriminal conditions of probation, for

10 example, if he had been drinking when he was not
11
12

supposed to be —
QUESTION;

No, suppose it related to

13

violations of law occurring during the period of parole,

14

is it your submission that he could refuse to answer

15

those questions and still the Constitution would protect

16

him from revokation?

17
18
19

HR. LYNN;

That is my reading. Your Honor, of

the decisions of this Court.
QUESTION;

Well, this Court has never

20 addressed that question in a

21

KR. LYNN;

Unless the —

parole context.

That is exactly right, Your Honor.

22

It may well be and there is some case law in lower

23

courts and in the circuit courts that in the context of

24

a probation officer-probationer relationship perhaps the

25

Fifth Amendment has no application whatsoever.

At least

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

there is some language in seme Second Circuit cases tc

2

that regard or at least this Court and other courts have

3

recognized that probationers like prisoners or parolees

4

have a lesser right in the Fourth Amendment area of

5

search or seizure and also in the Fifth Amendment area.
QUESTIONS

6

Is it the practice in Minnesota —

7

You are relying on federal lav rather -- Is it the

8

practice in Minnesota that the parole officers in effect

9

have an understanding with the parolees they do not have

10

to tell them things they do not want to tell them?
MR. LYNNs

11
12

practice is. Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

13
14

I really do not know what the

It seems to be very contrary to my

understanding of the way this normally works.
MR. LYNNs

15

All I can say is that in my

16

experience as a state court prosecutor this issue very

17

rarely ever comes up as to what transpired in the

18

interview.

19

QUESTION:

And what the nature of the duty of

20

the parolee to be candid with the parole officer is.

21

That never comes out?

22

MR. LYNNs

Certainly yes it has, Your Honor.

23 The duty, of course, is to be truthful.
24
25

QUESTIONS

Yes, be truthful but you say that

does not mean you have to answer any questions if you do

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

not want to answer them.

2

answer honestly and that is the extent of the obligation

3

in Minnesota.
MR. LYNN*

4

If you do answer you must

I believe — Your Honor, I guess I

5 cannot answer for the State of Minnesota because I do
6 not believe that that issue has been addressed in cur
7 courts either.

I can only deal with what is the

8 practice and then my interpretation of case law in this
9 Court.

But I do believe that if it is a valid

10
11

assertion of a Fifth Amendment claim and if a

12

probationer has his full right to a full Fifth Amendment

13 privilege that he cannot be punished for a valid
14

assertion of that privilege.

15

QUESTION»

16

to my question then?

17
18
19
20
21
22

Well, are you qualifying your answr

MR. LY'NNs

Only to the extent, Your Honor,

QUESTION»

By saying you do not Know if the

that —

probationer has a Fifth Amendment right?
MR. LYNN*

I am saying. Your Honor, that that

issue -- Yes, I guess I am saying that.

That issue has

23 not been expressly decided by this Court nor by the
24
25

Minnesota Supreme Court.
QUESTION*

So you withdraw your concession?

MB. LYNN

If

In that limited circumstance

2

it is a fact that a probationer has a lesser Fifth

3

Amendment right than others then I would withdraw that

4

concession.

5

fact.

6
7

I do not know that to be a fact or not a

This Court has recognized, however, that the
Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is

8 not self-executing, that is, it must be claimed.
9

If a

witness under compulsion to testify makes disclosures

10

instead of claiming the privilege the government simply

11

has not compelled him to incriminate himself.

12

The reason for that rule makes sense that a

13

person in the circumstance as the Respondent in this

14

case -- There are many factors and circumstances which

15

may compel one to incriminate himself.

10

with government compulsion and some may deal with the

17

person's own internal feelings or notions or ideas.

18
19

Some may deal

Unless the person attempts to claim or claims
the privilege there is no way to know whether or not

20 that individual made the admissions for reasons of his
21

own or made the admissions as a result of governmental

22 coersion or compulsion.

This Court has recognized very

23 narrowly limited situations where one who does not claim
24

that privilege may later assert it as a defense, and

25

those, of course, ate the inquiry here.

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

The inquiry narrowly is was the Defendant in

1

2

custody cr the Respondent in custody within the meaning

3 of the
4

Miranda case and the cases following; or

secondly, absent custody were these admissions somehow

5 coerced by genuine compulsion on the part of the
6

government?

Now custody as defined last July by this

7 Court in California v.

Baylor means, of course, formal

8

arrest and it also means a restraint of freedom of

9

movement of the degree associated with formal arrest.

10

In the facts of this case we have neither a

11

formal arrest nor a restraint of freedom to that

12

degree.

13

the probationer appear and report to his probation

The condition of probation required only that

14 officer.
15

QUESTIONS

16

MR. STRAUSS;

17

QUESTION:

18

Mr. Lynn.
Yes, sir.

Do I gather from your last couple

sentences that it is your view that the Supreme Court of

19 Minnesota thought this case was governed by our Miranda
20 decisi on?
21

MR. LYNN:

Not precisely. Your Honor.

The

22

Supreme Court of Minnesota said in their opinion that

23

the defendant was not in custody in the normal sense but

24

then from that position went on to identify three

25 factors in the facts of this case and expanded the

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

rationale if not the holding of Miranda to cover this

2

situation and require warnings.

3

QUESTIONS

I more or less read the Supreme

4

Court of Minnesota's opinion as saying that a

5

prophylactic requirement had been adopted in the Miranda

6 case in the custodial interrogation arrest situation and
7

they were going to fashion kind of another Miranda

8

doctrine in the parolee or probationer-probation officer

9

situation.

10

MB. LYNN:

11

Your Honor.

12

Miranda warnings.

I think that is precisely correct.

That is what they did.

It is half the

13

It is the right to remain silent and the

14

warning that the evidence may be used against you.

15

left off the counsel part of the Miranda warning.

18

They

This Court has never adopted a warnings and

17

waiver requirement in anything other than custodial

18

interrogation as that was definted by Miranda and the

19 cases following.

20
21

22
23
24

QUESTION:

Mr. Lynn, does the probation

officer in Minnesota have the power to arrest?
MR. LYNN:

The probation officer, Your Honor,

has the same powers of arrest as a citizen.
QUESTION:

Is the probation officer's office

25 located where?

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

ME. LYNN s

1

It is located in the government

2 center. Your Honor, which includes the courtrooms of the
3 county

-

4

QUESTION;

Is it in the court building or the

5 police building?
6

MR. LYNN;

It is in the court building, Ycur

QUESTION;

Did you say that the probation

7 Honor.

S

9 officer has the same power of arrest as a citizen?
10
11

ME. LYNN;
Honor,

Under cur arrest statute. Your

there are powers aplied to a peace officer and

12 then there are citizen powers.

They are almost all the

13 same.
14

A police officer may arrest with or without a

15 warrant on probable cause.

I belive perhaps the

16 specific answer here is that if this probation officer
17 had something amounting to probable cause or reasonable
18 cause that a violation of probation had occurred she
19 could cause his arrest.
20
21

Probation officers do not carry weapons in
Minnesota.

They do not conduct searches.

They do not

22 have any of the other powers that you may associate with
23
24

the police.
The trial court judge ruling found that this

25 defendant was not in custody within the meaning of

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Miranda.

2

that finding by not requiring the entire Miranda

3

proced ure.

4

The Minnesota Supreme Court implicity made

I believe it is clear on the facts of this

5

case and on the decisions of this Court that the

6

defendant was not in custody within the meaning of

7

Miranda.

8

United States v. Miller out of the Second Circuit,

9

United

10

There have been two lower court holdings.

States v. Holmes out of the Eighth Circuit which

agree with this conclusion.

11

I presume that in those situations the

12

probationer was under the same sort of probation

13

conditions as Respondent was here.

14

then to the second inquiry.

15

facts of this case that could be found to compel or to

16

prohibit or deny this Respondent the free choice to

17

admit,

18

Sc that leads me

Is there anything on the

to deny or to claim the privilege?
I believe as pointed out in the facts of this

19 case there is no identifiable factor here

which

20 interfered with that free choice on his part.
21

threatened him with revocation.

She never

She never threatened

22 him with any sanction whatsoever had he claimed the
23
24
25

Fifth Amendment.
Since he did not he cannot now raise it in
this Court.

Again, that inquiry looks further to the

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

totality of the circumstances, and I point out briefly

2 in that regard that the probation officer was acting on
3

good faith in the performance of her dual role (1) to

4

assist in the rehabilitation of the probationer, and (2)

5

to protect the public.

She spoke with this man about

6 treatment without threats or with coersion.

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. STRAUSS*

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Fifth Amendment speaks of compulsion.

It

15

prohibits the use of self-incriminating statements only

16

when those statements have in some way been compelled.

17

Now what is notable about the Minnesota

18

Supreme Court*s opinion in this case is its failure to

19

identify any source of compulsion that forced Respondent

20 to speak against his will.

This Court has after all

21

defined a test for determining whether confession has

22

been compelled.

23

The test is the familiar one whether

24

considering all the circumstances the defendant's will

25

was overborne.

But no one, neither Respondent nor the

19

handic apped.

He was not mentally

He was not particularly vulnerable in any

5 other way.

The probation officer's actions can scarcely

6

be cha racterized as intimidating or menacing or

a

QUESTIONS

Mr. St rauss, really are you fairly

10 r ea din g the Minnesota Supre me Court opinion?

They say

11

becaus e of the compulsory n ature of the meeting because

12

def end ant was under a court order to respond truthfully

13

to his agent's questions an d so forth.

14

relyin g on compulsion when they say that?
MR. STRAUSS*

15
16

Are they not

Wei 1, the source of compulsion

the y s eem to identify to th e extent they identify one

17 has so mething to do with th e probation conditions,

QUESTION:

18

You ma y disagree with their

19 conclu sion, but they did no t ignore the requirement is
20

all I am suggesting.
MR. STRAUSS*

21

Well, I think they were

22 insuf f iciently precise about realizing that they had to

23

find a ctual compulsion on the defendant to speak, but I

24 think
25

you are right. Justice Stevens, that —
QUESTION:

Well, what if they construed the

1

Minnesota probation condition to impose a legal

2 obligation on the probationer to answer all questions?

MR. STRAUSS;

3
4

Well, two answers to that.

the first place, they did not.

In

But even if they had

5 imposed that that would simply put him in the same
6 position as a grand jury witness who is under an
7

obligation to speak and it is well settled on the basis

8 of Monia and Cordell.
QUESTIONS

9

The principle —
Yes, but it is not becuase of an

10 absence of compulsion.

MR. STRAUSS;

11

Oh, that is right.

Of course#

12 had they construed the probation conditions to require

QUESTIONS

13

Well, it seems to me that is what

14

they are saying when they say he was under court order

15

to respond truthfully to his agent's questioning.

16

that not only say you have to be truthful but you have

Dees

17 to respond truthfully?

As I read that I thought they were holding

18

19 that he had a duty to respond.

MR. STRAUSSs

20

21

Well, the probation conditions

are set out and the probation condition requires —
QUESTIONS

As you know a statute means what

tells it does, and I would assume state

24

probation conditons mean what the state court tells us

25

they mean.

MR. STRAUSS

1

2

I

do not find in the Minnesota

Supreme Court's opinion explicit instruction of these

3 probation conditions to require the probationer to
4 speak
5

QUESTION;

They apparently just thought it was

6 rather obvious that a duty to respond truthfully
7

included a duty to respond.

8

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, the probation conditions

9 which after all are written in a fashion that is
10 supposed to be understood by the probationer say he must
11

be truthful.

That is really all they say on this

12 point.
13
14

As the state has pointed out to be truthful
means not to lie.
QUESTION;

15
16

Did it also say that if the

probation officer sees fit she can take you back to he

17 judge without any more than that?
18

MR. STRAUSS;

Yes, she can take him back if

19 she has reason to believe he is violating his
20 probation.
21

QUESTION;

And you do not consider that

22 coercion?
23

MR. STRAUSS;

Oh,

certainly net.

A police

24 officer who is interviewing a suspect with probable
25 cause and believes the suspect has committed a crime can

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

arrest

2

that the fact that he has probable cause means that he

3

has to give Miranda warnings.

4

QUESTIONS

5

the suspect on the spot, but that does not mean

You do not think a threat to have

your probation — Suppose she said if you do not confess

6 to me now I will have your probation revoked.
7

Would you

consider that coercion?
MR. STBAUSSs

8

Oh, yes.

That would be

9 compulsion. That would be a very different case.

QUESTIONS

10
11

between the two is she never used those words.
MR. STRAUSSs

12
13

The only difference I submit

I should say —

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. STRAUSSs

16 obvious at all.
17 Court said that.
18

Kell, she never said that to

But it was obvious was it net?
Oh, I do not think it was

I do not think the Minnesota Supreme
I also add. Justice Marshall, that

even though the situation you have described which is

19 not this case would constitute compulsion I do not think
20

21
22

23
24

it would violate the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTIONS

I was just hoping you would say

there might be possibly a little tit of coercion.
MR. STRAUSSs

I think -- The term the

Minnesota Supreme Court used is pressure.

25 doubt there were some factors that impelled

There is no

23

.

1

Respondent to speak

2

Usually when people confess there is some sort

3 of emotional factor involved that impels them to speak.
4 But pressure and influence as this Court made absolutely
5 clear in United States v. Washington those things dc not
6 amount to compulsion.
7
8

Compulsion is the overbearing of the witness'
will and the fact that the witness was influenced by

9 some circumstance, the fact that the State as the Court
10

said in Washington created an atmosphere conducive to

11

truth telling does not mean that the defendant was

12 coerced.
QUESTI0N«

13

May I just ask this?

What is ycur

14 view as to whether the probationer's probation could
15 have been revoked if he had said I will not answer the
16 question?
17

MR. STEAUSSs

Our view obviously as a matter

18 of federal constitutional law is that, yes, it could
19

have been revoked.

20

QUESTIONf

It is different —

21

MR. STRAUSSs

Yes, we disagree with the State

22 on that point.
23

QUESTIOMj

There are two points to be kept in

24 mind about the probation conditions to the extent that
25

those are where the Minnesota Supreme Court located the

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

compulsion in this case.

One is as the State has

2 explained that they did not literally require him to
3

answer every single question, and I think, as most

4

naturally interpreted they did not require him to answer

5 every single question.
I think it is fair to say they imposed on him

6

7 a general duty to cooperate, but that does not mean that
8 if, for example, he thought the probation officer was

9

asking a question that had nothing to do with probation

10 and was invasive of his privacy that he could not have
11

refused to answer for that question, for that reason.

12

It certainly does not mean that he could not have said I

13

would

14

incriminate me.

rather not answer that because it might

But the second and I think more important

15
16

point about the probation condition is that Respondent

17 did not at any time seek either to clarify the meaning
18 of those probation conditions or to invoke his Fifth
19

Amendment privilege to the probation officer.

Now had

20 he been unwilling to speak with the probation officer he
21

would surely have said something to her suggesting his

22

reluctance and asking whether he could refrain from

23 speaking.
24
25

QUESTIGMs

Was he not told to talk to the

probation officer?

MR. STRAUSS:

He was told to arrange meetings

And talk to her.
And to be truthful with her.

And to be truthful with her.
That is right.

You said he was not.
No, he was told those things,

but those are different things from being told to answer

10

every question even if it is incriminating.

11

never told that, and he never asked whether he had tc

12

answer every question.

13

He was

He could not conceivably have thought that

14

just asking do I have to talk about that would

15

jeopardize his probation, and it seems to me that if the

16 Respondent would rather net have discussed the crime and
17

was really being dragged into discussing the crime

18 against his will because he feared

that his probation

19 might be revoked if he did not discuss it that the most
20

natural thing for him to have done would have been to

21

say do I have to talk about that.

22

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Strauss, would that be

23

natural if he was under the impression that the purpose

24

of the inquiry was tc make sure he was getting

25 appropriate

treatment?

Would he not think that the

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

right thing to do in his own self-interest would he to

cooperate with the person who was trying to help him in

MR. STRAUSS;

4
5
3
7

8

Well, that might have been a

rea son.
QUESTIONS

Is that not what she told him that

she wanted the information for?
MR. STRAUSS;

I believe she did.

That might

9 have been a reason for him to cooprate but —
10
11

12

QUESTION;

Was he at error in relying on what

she told him?
MR. STRAUSS;

She never -- No court has found

13 that she made any promise implicit or explicit that she
14 would keep the information in confidence and would net
15

use it and would not go to the police with it.

16

at the end of the interview when she said to him you

17

know I have to go to the police with this he said he

18

understood --

19

QUESTION:

In fact,

Well, if he knew and who knows

20

whether he did or not what the restrictions are on the

21

use of this kind of information at the treatment center

22

would he not normally have assumed that he could gc

23 forward with further discussion without running
24
25

this

particular risk?
MR. STRAUSS;

If there were some sort of

Well, there is a legal promise is

NR. STRAUSS!

Well, no apparently there is

not.
QUESTION!

6

Well, was there not a restriction

7 on the treatment center’s use of the information?
8

HR. STRAUSS;

9

QUESTION;

I gather there was, yes.

Did that restriction not bind the

10

probation officer until he repeated it to her face tc

11

face?
HR. STRAUSS:

12
13

That is my understanding from

the State, but that is different from there being a

14 restriction on the information that the probation
15

officer could give out on the basis of his statements.

16

Had there been some finding that she implicitly or

17

explicitly promised him that what he said would go no

18

further and would only be used for purposes of treatment

19

I quite agree that this would be a different case under

20

Bram.

21

Rut there is no finding in the basis of the

22 opinion below.

23

It is plainly not that there was such an

implicit promise or unfairness of this sort.

24

I would also reiterate as I said to Justice

25

Stevens earlier that even if the probation conditions

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

are construed as having required Respondent to answer

2 every single question that just puts him in the same
3

positi on as any subpoened witness,, and under the Kcnia

4

presum ption rearffirmed by such cases as Garner and

5 Robert s and by the Mandujano plurality such a witness
6

has to assert the privilege against self-incriminaticn

7 in res ponse to a question or he will not be considered
8

to hav e been compelled to answer that question.
The reason for that rule, of course, is that

9

10 witnes ses are often willing to speak even though they
11

cou Id be compelled to speak were they not willing, and

12 unless

a witness objects and asserts his privilege there

13

is no reason to conclude that he was not answering

14

willin gly.

Respondent is at the very worst at the same

15 positi on as that.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Strauss, if he did plead the

17 Fifth Amendment could his probati on be revoked for

Mr. We rnick, are you saying that

On t he question that the Court

18 has asked whether his proba tion could be revoked for

asserting the privil ege it is my position that a

MR. WERNICK:

1
2

It is an unsettled question and

I am analogizing to Baxter v. Palmigiano where this

3 Court said that if a prisoner asserts the privilege at a
4

prison disciplinary hearing an adverse inference could

5 be raised at the hearing and similarly perhaps if a
6

probationer asserts the privilege to a probation officer

7

the probation officer could draw an adverse inference

8 and that along with some other fact could be used to
9 revoke .

dilemma
The only way out of the dilemma was for him to

assert the privilege, and the issue was whether he

oth er words did the probation officer do something or

6 was th e situation such that he was impaired from

QUESTION*

1

Are you suggesting. Hr. Wernick,

2

that there is a constitutional right to keep the cat in

the bag to use your words or is it a constitutional

4

right not to be compelled or forced to let the cat cut

5

of the bag?
MR. WERNICK*

6
7

The constitutional right is not

to be compelled , but where the government leads you to

8 believe that the cat is already out of the bag and,
9

therefore, you make a disclosure the government has

10 mislead you and has impaired your ability to assert the

privilege.

proposition?
MR. WERNICK*

19

That where the government has

mislead as to the purpose?
QUESTION*

17 in Oregon v.
18

What is your authority for that

Well, the same thing was involved

Mathiason.

We said it did not make any

difference.
MR. WERNICK*

No, the Court did not reach that

20

point in Oregon v. Mathiason.

The only issue in Oregon

21

v. Mathiason was whether the defendant was in custody at

22

the time, and the Court said that the falsehood that the

23

police officer had told the defendant had nothing to do

24 with the issue of whether or not he was in custody.
25

Whether or not Miranda applied.

to him that the purpose of discussing this murder was tc

19

less then three times that her concern was treatment.

about the behavioral relationship between the false

imprisonment and the murder because I think that

3

Well, let's answer it.

So she had a right to ask him that

question.
HE. WERNICKs

4

No question, Your Honor, she had

5 a right to ask the question, but she has to ask

the

6 question in a way that is consistent with the privilege
7

against compelleld self-incrimination and she already

9

that in her mind.

decision was made.

him to call the lawyer.
QUESTION*

2

Well, that indicated he was aware

3 of the problem.
4
5

MR. WERNICKi
there was a problem.

I believe he was aware that
Murphy testified that when he was

6 confronted with this by the probationer flags went up in
7 his head.
8

He said I felt like calling a lawyer but once

9

the probation officer then says to him you will have to

10 deal with a lawyer outside the office because now I want
11

to talk about treatment that prevented Murphy from

12

making any other assertion of his Fifth Amendment

rights .

14

QUESTIONS

Mr. Wernick, I do not read the

15

Supreme Court of Minnesota's opinion as relying on

16

implied representations by the probation officer.

17
18

MR. WERNICKi

That is correct, Your Honor.

In

the question presented by the State of Minnesota in its

19 petiton for certiorari they identify the fact that this
20 was a compulsory process and that the probation officer

21

had substantial reason to know that the answers would be

22 incriminatory and, therefore, the privilege was
23

self-executing at that point and this is a case where

24

the Court could reach that issue and deciced whether or

25

not based on those two factors the privilege would be

But that is asking us to make a

9

KB. WEBNICK:

10 conclusion.
11

Well, it is really a legal

Your Honor, I believe because the facts are

in the Supreme Court opinion.

The facts are she had

12 intended all along to report wurphy to the police and
13

yet she made representations of treatment and she told

14

them he could not call a lawyer.

Those facts are all in

15 the opinion.
16

The Court said in more general languge than

17 just limiting it to the two factors I have identified
18 the Court said in the same paragraph as a matter of due
19

process where this probation officer had already decided

20 to report Murphy to the police this cannot be used
21
22

against him.
So I think the Court can affirm based on the

23 facts that are in the Supreme Court opinion.

When she

24 told him again that she would net let him call a lawyer
25 because she wanted to talk about this behavioral

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

relationship I submit that when he first said he felt

2

like calling a lawyer he was worried that the sc-called

3

cat had gotten out of the bag, but when she said you

4

cannot call a lawyer because I want you to talk about

5

this behavioral relationship at that point it was fair

6 of him

to assume that they were only talking about

7

treatment.

8

the confession in this case because the confession

9

really is an explanation of why he does not need

10

Indeed, I ask the Court to look closely at

treatm ent.
His confession is I am innocent of the false

11
12

imprisonment charge.

At the time of the murder I was on

13

drugs.

14

false imprisonment is not related to the murder and

15

therefore I do not need treatment.

I am not using drugs any more therefore the

This is his confession.

16

Now it was after he

17

made the confession the probation officer said well you

18

know I have to go to the police.
It was at that point Murphy says, well, I

19

20

understand that and then he says to his probation

21

officer you must really care about me to have me come in

22 and talk about this because you could have just picked
23

up the phone and started dialing the police.

Again,

24

Murphy was wrong about the nature of his confidentiality

25

rights.

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

The federal statute is clear.

1

The probation

2 officer could not just have picked up the phone and
3
4

called

the police.
The language of the federal statute is that

5

neither the treatment center nor the probation officer

6

may initiate or substantiate a criminal prosecution

7

based on information received from these federaly funded

8 treatment centers.
9

So when Murphy said you just could

have called the police again Murphy was wrong about his

10 confidentiality rights.
11

The issue in this case does not turn on

12

whether Murphy was in custody because she had this legal

13

power to compel.

14

The significance in this case —

QUESTION;

Can I ask you if the probation

15

officer calls in a person on probation and says I hear

16

you have been out drinking in bars and you know that you

17 are not supposed to do that.

Have you been doing it and

18

remember that if you refuse to answer your probation can

19

be revoked, and he refuses to answer.

20
21
22

Would you say that the probation can be
revoked in that circumstance if he refuses to answer?

probation will be revoked and the fellow says well I

I have but he says you have compelled me

8

to answer so you may not revoke my probation or use this

against me.

Your Honor,

you are setting up

categories for me which I am not sure how to describe

a "quasi" criminal proceeding.

QUESTION;
the word "quasi".

Well the Constitution does not use
It either is or it is not.

ME. WERNICK;

Well, perhaps then it is best

said that -QUESTION;

But the point that you have to keep

in mind is that the use that might be made of his answer

10

what might be one thing in a subsequent trial and might

11

be something else in a parole revocation hearing if that

12

is not a criminal proceeding.

13

MR. WERNICK;

I fully agree with the Court.

14

If in this case let’s assume that the law is that where

15

a probation officer uses a compulsory process to

16

deliberately incriminate, to gather evidence for the

17

police that the law is that that cannot be used in a

18

criminal trial absent some sort of advisory of the Fifth

19

Amendment privilege.

20
21

Now the law may be is that when there is not
Fifth Amendment privilege advisory you cannot use the

22 statement in the context of a criminal

trial but you

23

could use it in a context of a revocation hearing.

24

reason I said in this case you could not use Murphy's

25

statements in a revocation hearing is because the

The

1

She completely undermined Murphy’s ability to

3

assert the privilege when he said --

QUESTION:

Well, what difference does it

5

make?

6

She compelled him in every sense of the word.

think.

13

What if she beat him up to get the information

It still

There is no Fifth Amendment objection to doing
it unless you violated some other right.
MR. WERNICK:

Well, Your Honor, the Court

raises good points and I guess my position is that cnee

14 she cuts off his total ability to assert the privilege
15

by saying he cannot call a lawyer that if he comes sc

16 involuntary at that point that it should not be used for
17 any purpose whatsoever.
18

QUESTION:

I got the impression earlier you

19

had more or less conceded that in light of Murphy's

20

remarks about a lawyer that he did not need a warning.

21

A warning would have been a formality.

I want to be

22 sure what is your position on that?
23

MR. WERNICK:

My position is that after he

24

said I feel like calling a lawyer and was told that he

25

could not because he had to talk about treatment that

to the extent he might have been worried about a

MR. WERNICK:

11

QUESTION*

12

MR . WERNICK*

Yes he did.

13

MR . WERNICK:

But there is no dispute in this

My point is that —

Did he not eventually do it?

Justice Marshall, that the lawyer was on notice

15 that Murphy wanted to talk to a lawyer before he talked
18
17

about the murder.

The only reason he did not do that is

because the probation officer said to him you cannot.

I would like to know if the

said all right I will get you the

No because the probation officer

has the power to compel Murphy to talk about it# tut

3

like any other compulsory process of the court or

QUESTION:

5

6

Would you have given the same

answer if the question had pertained to an alleged

7 criminal act after the beginning of the probationary
8
9

period?
MR. WESNICK«

Yes.

A person on probation has

10

full Fifth Amendment rights with respect to new criminal

11

prosecutions.

12

13

QUESTION:

But what if he then said well I

want the information solely for the purpose and I

14 represent to you it will be

used only for that purpose

15

of determining whether or not to revoke your probation.

16

Would he have a duty to answer that question or not?

17
18

MR. WERNICK:

I would say he would not have a

duty to answer that question, but that the probation

19 officer at that point under the authority of Baxter v.
20

Palmigiano and the Court has not decided this issue in

21

the context of

probation but that the probation officer

22 could at that point probably make an adverse inference.
23

In other words, when the probationer will not talk about

24

it the probation officer can assume the worst.

25

QUESTION:

Well, if that is true then he might

49

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

as well answer if the consequence is going to he parole

2

revocation if that is the maximum consequence.

3

HR. WERNICKs

That is.true if he has been

4

assured that what he says is not going to be used

5

against him at a criminal trial.

6

QUESTION*

Well, if the rule of the employee

7

discharge cases applies it follows automatically that

8

the testimony would be immunized from use at a criminal

9

prosecution but not from use for discharge purposes.

10
11

HR. WERNICKs

I agree.

When I say, by the

way, that Murnphy could not have been revoked just for

12 asserting the privilege the State of Minnesota does
13

concede that if Murphy had asserted the privilege there

14

would have been a revocation hearing.

15

QUESTION;

Well, as a practical matter when a

16

person asserts the privilege really the only option that

17

the person sitting there or a court is to draw an

18

adverse inference if they refuse to testify.

19

are going to get out the thumbscrews you do not ever

20

literally, you know, compel anyone to testify against

21

their will.

22
23

25

Unless you

It is really other devices that are used in
the face of a refusal to testify.
HR. WERNICKs

Yes, I am not sure I fellow the

Court’s point, though, on that.

But nonetheless it is

50

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

compulsion whether it is physical force or not.

2

compulsion.

3

I missed the Court's point.

4

QUESTIONi

It is

I thought you were suggesting in

5

your response to Justice Stevens that there was

0

something peculiar about the fact that the remedy would

7

have been to draw an adverse inference, and really I

8 think that is what the remedy is in most cases.
MR. WERNICK:

9

Yes, except in a criminal trial

10 where the Fifth Amendment prohibits the finder of fact

11

from drawing an adverse inference.

I do not know how

12 enforceable that is but certainly the jury cannot be
13 instructed that they can draw an adverse inference.

You cannot agrue that they can draw an adverse

14
15

inference.

But in a criminal trial you cannot draw an

16 adverse inference, and that may be the difference I am
17

suggesting between the criminal trial and the revocation

18 proceeding.
19

It is an unsettled question of law.

The cases

20

that the Solicitor General cited in limiting the Fifth

21

Amendment or in suggesting that this Court should limit

22

the Fifth Amendment rights of probationers are First

23

Amendment and Fourth Amendment cases where this Court

24 has said that because of the particular institutional
25 needs of a prison system the government can limit First

51

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Amendment rights and Fourth Amendment rights of people

2

in prison.

3

The precedent in this Court for limiting Fifth

4

Amendment rights of people convicted of crime is to the

5

contrary.

6

when they are being interrogated about new offenses

7

while they are in prison, and this Court did assume in

8

Baxter v. Palmigiano that if a prisoner were to be

9

compelled to testiy at a prison disciplinary hearing

10

then his testimony would be immunized at a criminal

11

trial.

Prisoners are entitled to Miranda warnings

So there is no authority for the propostion

12
13

that the Fifth Amendment rights of probationers should

14

be limited in the context of what can be used against

15

them in a criminal trial.

that another significant fact in that regard is

that at the time Murphy talked about this he was already

3 in violation of his probation for having failed

QUESTIONj

—

I take it then consistent with your

5 answers to me before and to Justice Stevens if the

8 probation officer says to him I just want to check up on
7 your treatment now have you been taking your treatment
8 as you were supposed to do and the gentleman says I
9

refuse to answer.

I will not talk about that and I do

10 not have to talk about that.
11
12

I have been advised by my

lawyer I do not have to talk about it.
The probation officer says well I am going to

13

go to the judge and am going to revoke your probation.

14

He says well you cannot do that I have been advised by

15 my lawyer that you cannot revoke my probation.

Would

16 you say that he could not revoke the probation then?

He goes to

with one of the conditions of your probation.

53

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

may be able to revoke probation on that ground because

MR. WERNICK;

1

There is nothing illegal about

the government compelling information.

consistent with the Fifth Amendment.

Fifth Amendment.
It seems to me, Your Honor, all parties in

11
12

this case have agreed that the most important

13

institutional need of the probation system is a trust

14

relationship between the probationer and the probation

15

officer.

16

conduct of the probation officer in this case then that

17

institutional need would be undermined, and I ask the

18

Court to affirm the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme

Court.

If this Court puts its seal of approval on the

Mr. Lynn, do you have

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. LYNN, ESQ.,

23

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

24

MR. LYNN*

A few points if I may. Your Honor.

25

As to the issue of a mention of a lawyer in

56

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

this conversation on September 28th the constitutional

2

right to a lawyer arises in only two circumstances that

3

have been recognized by this Court.

4

in-custody Miranda type of interrogation where the

5

request for a lawyer is viewed by the prophylactic rules

That is the

6 in that decision to affect protection of the Fifth
7 Amendment rights.
8

The only other situation is at a critical

9

stage of a criminal proceeding and that is the true

10 Sixth
11

Amendment right to counsel.

Neither of those two

situations applies to a probation interview generally or

12 to this one spedifically.

Secondly,

13

just to reiterate my major point.

14 The privilege in the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit
15 asking questions or asking incriminative questions.

It only prohibits the government from

16

17 compelling self-incrimination.

The focus of that

18

inquiry has to be on the words and deeds and actions of

19

the governmental agent in this particular case.
Either individually or in combination there

20

21

are no factors identifiable here in the conduct of the

22 probation officer which could be found under the
23

existing decisions of this Court to compel his answers

24 in the sense that he did not have the free choice to
25 admit,

deny or to claim the privilege.

QUESTION*

1

Hr. Lynn, what if Minnesota's

2

parole conditions were a little less ambiguous because

3

apparently there is some argument about what they really

4

mean.

5

probationer has an absolute duty to respond to every

6

question propounded to him by the probation officer

Supposing they said in so many words every

7 truthfully, fully in all detail concerning conduct
8

during the probationary period, and the failure to

9

respond to any such question shall be grounds for

10

revocation of the probation, would there be any

11

constitutional objection to that?

12

MR. LYNN*

I do not believe so, Your Honor.

13

QUESTIONS

But you do not construe these

14

parole conditions to require any such broad duty to

15

respond as I understand your argument.

I would think

16 the interest of the parole system would be served by
17

maximizing the flow of communication rather than by

18

creating situations where you have got to claim

19 privileges and all the rest.

MR. LYNNs

20
21

Court.

22

there is a problem —

I would generally agree with the

Of the facts of this particular case, however,

There is a problem because it

relates to antecedent criminal conduct, but if it were

25 not for that — Hell, I guess we understand each other.
