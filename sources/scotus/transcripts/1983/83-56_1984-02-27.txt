Under Part A, the Federal Government, actiro

Congress set up a system under vedicare in

In 1975 CHS began tc receive grant funds from

the Federal Government under the Comprehensive

Employment and Training Act, or CETA,

20

used the federal CETA grant funds to pay their salaries

2

however, offset against these costs the amount of the

3

federal CETA funds it received to pay those salaries.

4

The obvious result of this bookkeeping was that CHS cot

reimbursed twice by the Federal Government for a single

6

group of expenses, cnee by CETA and then again by

7

8

CHS did rot,

'sot surprisingly, this double reimbursement
was plainly contrary tc Medicare regulations, which

10

prohibit the inclusion in a provider’s cost reports of

11

expenses covered by so-called restricted grant funds,

12

such as CETA.

13

expressly state that if restricted grant funds such as

14

CE^A funds were net offset from a provider’s expenses,

15

the provider would receive reimbursement for the same

16

expenses twice, and that cf course is precisely what

17

happened here.

In fact, the published regulations

workers in its cost reports, but did net deduct the

20

23

occasions that the CETA grant did net have tc be

5

In 1977, after CHS again asked Travelers if

6

the CETA grants fell within the seed money exception,

7

Travelers decided to ask the department of Health and

8

Human Services for its advice cn the matter.

with the Secretary that the amount spent on the salaries

exception for application of this rule?

21

invoking the doctrine cf estoppel based or. the alleged

not authorized by the statute and as tc which CHS has

think

that for two reasons.
First, we submit that CHS failed even to meet

And the Court of Appeals reached

On a number of recent occasions this Court in

12

that in each of these cases the Court found it

13

unnecessary to resolve the question because the conduct

at issue did net constitute affirmative misconduct.

15

Nonetheless, the lower courts have seized on the dictum

16

in this Court's decisions and have branded-as

affirmative misconduct a. number of actions that aren't

is the hypothetical as to what would have occurred, the

But in this case there was certainly an

according to an interpretation of them, although people

have an effective Constitution that did not guarantee

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Geller?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT CE KENNETH S. C-ELIEF, ESC.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
ME. GELLEE;

I'd just like, if I could, to

clear up a few points made in Mr. Easley's argument.
The first, as I understand it the Respondent

17

claims than the affirmative misconduct here was

18

Travelers' violation of this mandatory duty it

19

apparently had to communicate with EHS about this

20

question it had gotten.

21

or the Medicare regulations or in the contract that

22

intermediaries sign with HHS that in any way imposes a

23

mandatory duty to communicate every question they get

24

from the provider.

25

There's nothing in the statute

Obviously, an intermediary can't consult HHS

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

on everything or else the whole system would break

2

down.

3

every time an intermediary not a question it had tc pass

4

it along tc HRS.

5

some discretion, and perhaps here bad judgment was

6

exercised, but it was not a violation of a mandatory

7

duty.

There*d be no reason to have intermediaries if

8

9

Obviously, an intermediary has tc cse

And I might add that some perhaps some duty
would

arise tc pass along tc HHS a question when the

10

provider specifically asks the intermediary to do sc.

11

But once again, I repeat here, there's no evidence that

12

CHS ever asked Travelers tc get an interpretation from

13

HHS .
QUESTIONS

14

Mr. Geller, if the intermediary is

15

negligent in seme way, is it your thought that it could

16

be held liable?
MR. GELLEF.i

17

Now, there the Government has

18

taken

19

Government and therefore they have no independent

20

liability.

21

which explains that the Administrator cf the Health Care

22

Financing Administration is the real party in interest

23

in any

24
25

the position that intermediaries are agents cf the

There is in fact a regulation, 42 CFP 421.5,

suit arising under the Medicare Act.
As Mr. Hasley mentions, however, they have

sued Travelers in this case and that is an issue that

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

2

the Third Circuit has ret yet adjudicated.
But Respondents claims here time and again

3

that it has an entitlement tc a binding answer of any

4

question it has under the Medicare program.

5

it perceives as the affirmative misconduct here, a

6

violation cf this entitlement tc a binding answer.

7

That's what

But there obviously can't be under the

8

Medicare Act, where there are cnly interim payments and

9

subsequent adjustments, a binding answer.

And the

10

regulation that I read earlier, 405.1885, is conclusive

11

that an intermediary can't give a binding answer and

12

that an answer that even the Secretary gives can be

13

reopened within a three-year peried.

14

It is, once again, quite instructive that the

15

Respondent has net yet explained what that regulation

16

means or how it could have reasonably relied on the

17

intermediary's advice in the face cf it.

18

The Respondent says it all boils down to the

19

scope of authority of an agent, and as this Court has

20

said on many occasions, employees of the Executive

21

Branch, it is net within their authority tc amend Acts

22

of Congress; they are subject tc Acts cf Congress.
