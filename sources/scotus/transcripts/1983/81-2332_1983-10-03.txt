Mr. Crenshaw, I think

CEAI ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS N. CRENSHAW, ESQ.,

5

ON EEHAIF CF PETITIONER
MR. CRENSHAW:

6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7 please the Ccurt:

The question in this case is whether the

8

9 Respondent telephone company is eligible under the terms
0 of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Properties

Acquisition Policies Act cf 1970 to be reimbursed fcr
12 its costs

when it disconnects transmission lines beneath

3 certain streets in the City of Norfolk, Virginia and
4 rebuilds replacement lines under new streets.

The claim was submitted to the Petitioner,

5

6 Redevelopment Authority, and was denied because it felt
7 that the common law requires a utility company to move
8 its transmission lines at its expense, and the Uniform
9 Act did not change the common law.

Furthermore, the

20 telephone company did net meet the threshold

2

requirements for eligibility under the Uniform Act

22 because it did net move personal property, and it did

23

not move any property as a result of the acquisition of

24 land.
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

Now the telephone company had installed its

1
2

facilities in the streets of Norfolk pursuant to a

3 franchise with the City of Norfolk by virtue of which it
4

had a mere license.

It was a franchisee and it is the

5 established common law in Virginia and in the
6 overwhelming majority of other states that a utility
7

company having such a franchise has the obligation cf

8 moving its lines at its own

9

expense when the public good

requires those lines to be relocated.
This is a long-standing and well understood

10

and respected custom and the opinion cf the Circuit

Under these projects areas of blighted

18 property were acquired.

The old buildings were

19 demolished and the cleared land was made available fer

20 redevelopment.
21
22

In certain instances it was necessary and
desirable tc rearrange certain streets, and the

23 Redevelopment Authority petitioned the City of Norfolk
24 to close streets so that the new street pattern could be
25 established.

The city did close those streets, and In a

very cooperative manner the city, the Petitioner and the

2 City of Norfolk worked together with the telephone
3 company to work out an arrangement for the new streets
4 to be built in a manner that the public and

the private

6 minimum of inconvenience to

all of the parties.

There was no cohersion, no eminent domain.

Over a year after the redevelopment work had

10
11

been done and the new streets had been laid the

12

telephone company filed its claim which had been

13 denied.

I think it is important that the Court

14 recognize the nature of the facilities that are here
15 involved.

They consist primarily of conduits which are

20 about four inches in diamater which carry cooper cables
21

which have as many as 3600 pairs in them.

Those

22 conduits extend between underground vaults which are

23 known as manholes.
24

These manholes are larger than a man is tall.

25 They are like a little subterranean womb.

I would think so, but the

difficulty here is I think you had a flat out decision

20 by the Virginia Supreme Court which is contrary to the
21

and the Fourth Circuit in my judgment

22 was a not too exhaustively reasoned opinion with respect
23 to that so that I think that it is not facetious for me

them .
I do not have to win on all three, but I think

16

17 they are all three sound.

The first one is that the Act

18 did not cover utilities at all.

This, I think, is the most compelling

19
20 argument.
21
22
23

The Uniform Act was passed after a decade of

extensive congressional committee inquiry.
It followed a prior decade when the highway
statutes had been considered.

During the 1950’s the

24 Federal-Aid Highway statutes came along and in those
25 hearings there was expressed and careful attention tc

the requirements cf the utility companies.

The Highway

2 Act contains Section 123 which dealt with utility

3 companies.
4

Contrarywise, during the 196C’s when the

5 hearings were being held on the Uniform Relocation Act
6

there was no congressional inquiry into the plight cf

7

the utilities.

8

10

There were —

QUESTIONS

Why do you suppose that is?

It

seems so strange that no discussion of that emerged.
MS. CRENSHAWs

The only reason that I can say

11

is that the Congress was satisified with the solution

12

given by the Highway Act because that solution which was

13 in Section 123 was retained.
14
15

QUESTION:

It was net changed.

But, of course, in the language of

the Relocation Act in defining a person it did net admit

16 of any exception, and I think it is just strange that
17

there would net be seme reference in the legislative

18 history to the utility problem.
19

MR. CRENSHAW;

I think it is strange that in

20 all of those hearings with the hundreds really of
21

representatives that there was no movement by utilities

22 to have had their particular problem addressed.

I think

23 that the overwhelming reason was that the Uniform
24 Relccaticn Act dealt with the acquisition of private
25 property by and large from individuals and

The C£F does not have private property.

It

does not have a corapensible property interest in its

q

The Fugate case by the Supreme Court of
Virginia has held that their interest as a licensee does

7 not amount to a compensible property interest so

that I

S think that the purpose of the Uniform Act was to help
g those people whose property was being taken by eminent
10 domain and tc supplement the benefits.
11

The people who

were getting fair market value under the principles cf

12 eminent domain were not being fairly treated.
13

A hardware store, for example, that was in a

14 redevelopment project if their property was condemned
15 they would get the fair market value of the building,
13 but unless they got relocation costs they would

not get

17 the cost to move to a new location and they had to
13 compete against

another hardware store in the community

ig who had the fair market value of their property.

It had

20 not been taken, but they did net have to move.
21

That was the kind of disproportionate burden

22 that I think the committees looked into.

The statistics

23 are overwhelming that that is the sort cf thing that
24 they inquired about.
25

I think the statute had primarily humanitarian

the ccmmcn

I just do not see

4 anywhere in this statute or its legislative history any
5 contemplation of the problem of utility lines, and as
6 the District Court noted this matter was not under the

7 table or hidden or secret at all.
8

There was a live controversy right across the

9 Potomac in Virginia where PEPCC and the Virginia highway
10 Commission were going through all sorts of litigation
11

about this very matter, but it was related to Section

12

123 of the Highway Act so that I think that the Act just

13 simply did not contemplate it.
14

Hhen you compare the Uniform Act to actions of

15 the Congress before the Highway statute or actions cf
16 the Congress afterwards, in 1972 it adopted legislation
17 which permitted

relocation costs to utilities in the

18 District of Columbia.

Specifically the committees dealt

19 with that problem.
20

They recognized that if they did not pass this

21 the utility companies would not be compensated, and that
22 was two years after the Uniform Act.

Again, this past

23 Kay in the Senate they have adopted amendments to this
24 very statute that we are talking about.
25

I realize this is after this claim and after

It is the same thrust that is being
I think that the action by the Congress cr

4 the Senate this last May is very revealing about the
5 congressional intent.

7 federal condemnations?

With respect to the highways it is interesting

12

Yes, it does.

that Chapter 5 of the Highway Act was amended and

13 repealed, but Section 123 of the Highway Act which
14 pertained to utilities was left exactly as it was sc
15 that the Uniform Act came up and
16 123.

sat on top of Section

It refers to the comment by Justice Towell in the

17 previous case.
18
19

There you have a specific statute, Section
123, which deals with utility relocation.

You have a

20 general statute, the Uniform Relocation Act, which was

21

passed in foreknowledge of the Highway statute which

22 says nothing about

23

it.

I think that simply shouts cut that the

24 Uniform Act does not contemplate utilities.

There are

25 21 federal agencies which administer some 5C programs

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that are affected by this Act
None of them have regulations which pertain to

2

3 utility relocation.

HOD which is the agency which was

4 involved here has a specific regulation that the
5 relocation costs for a utility transmission line is not
6

an eligible cost unless the state law requires it.

7

That regulation was in effect before the

8

Uniform Act.

It is in effect after the Uniform Act and

9

there was no change by HUD.
So surely the agencies which interpret this

10
11

Act as well as the utility companies in the localities

12

have dealt with this Act as not including utilities.

13 Now there are two threshold requirements.

I have alluded briefly to one, that is, you

14

15 must move personal property.
16

I contend that it is net

personal property.
I think these facilities manifestly are real

17

18 property, but secondly they were not moved.

the Courts
In the view cf the United States the Court of

13 Appeals has misinterpreted the pertinent provisions cf
14 the Federal Uniform Relocation Assisance Act.

It is our

15 submission that that Act was never intended to address
18 the question of who should tear the cost of
17 reconstructing utility lines when these lines are

19 improvements in the very streets in which they have teen

forthrightly was that the petition should be denied.

2

I take it that is a moot question.

have a right to change your mind.

I just want tc be

5 sure.

HR. SCHWARTZ;

6

We have to that degree

7 certainly — Well, the question is no longer presented
8

whether the Ccurt should have granted the petition.

The

petition has been granted.
QUESTION;

10

I know tut that is not the extent

11

of your prior position.

12

MR. SCHWARTZ;

13

QUESTION;

That is right.

Ycur prior position was that this

14 was a reasonable construction of the statute.

MR. SCHWARTZ;

15
16 White,

18
1

that is quite right.
QUESTION;

17

If I may continue, Justice

You have changed ycur mind on

that?
MR. SCHWARTZ;

We have concluded that It is an

20 erroneous construction of the statute.

21

The position we

urge is the same one we urged in the Ccurt of Appeals,

22 and if I might just say this, our reason for concluding
23

that it is erroneous is based frankly on a closer study

24 of the statute.

We believe that we have identified

25 concrete statutory language that this claim simply dees

16

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

not fit
Sc that contrary to what we said in the

2

3 unfortunate brief we filed at the petition stage, this
4 case simply dees not in our view involve interpolating

5 an exception into plain statutory language that covers
6 the situation.

That is what the Court of Appeals

7 thought it involved, and if that were true the Ccurt of

8 Appeals might be right.
But we believe that the statutory requirement

9
10 which
11

says that payment shall be made for moving cf

personal property or for moving one's self or one's

12 business simply cannct comfortably be made tc cover the
13 situation of reconstrue ting

utility lines.

I think the

14 words are important, and the reality is important.
15

This really is a construction job.

The

16 Respondent -- I refer to C&P as the Respondent -- says
17 in their answering brief that we are in nc position to
18 deny that their claims represent certain matters.
19

One of the things they say they represent are

20 the costs of reconstructing those lines.
21

I take that tc

be a concession that what we are talking about for the

22 largest part is the cost cf digging new trenches,
23 pouring new concrete, installing new pipes, laying and
24 installing new cables, and it seems to me that it would
25 be a very odd choice of words indeed to use the words

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

"moving personal property” if one wanted to describe

2 those operations and paying for those costs.
3

If I might turn to something Justice C'Ccnror

4 asked,

the Court is not confronted necessarily with

5 question of

the

whether the Fourth Circuit misunderstood

6 Virginia law.

There is a question here whether this

7 equipment, these lines are real or personal property.

The government is skeptical cf the Fourth

8

9 Circuit's conclusion that it is all personal property.
10 If the Court please, the Petitioner has lodged with

11

the

clerk an illustration of a sample utility manhole which

12 is as far as we can see an underground building,

and if

13 you look closely at the Court cf Appeals' opinion I
14 would suggest that the Court of Appeals may have simply
15 misunderstood what the physical equipment involved was
16 and what the operation of replacing it was.

The Court of Appeals appears to have believed

17
18

that this equipment was removed from its location and

19 transferred to a new location.

Because of that

20 misunderstanding I think the ordinary deference tc the
21

Court of Appeals reading of state law is not required

22 here.
23

But even if it were, the question necessarily

24 presented is a federal one,
25 Congress meant by "moving."

the question of what

property in a manhole in Virginia is personal property?

15

MR. SCHWARTZ*

16

QUESTION*

The federal statute does net —

Can a statute say that, a federal

17 statut e?
18

MR. SCHWARTZ*

A federal statute could say

1

that for the purposes of this statute the term "personal

20

property" shall include the following, and the Congress

21

could choose that manner of legislating.

We are not

22 suggesting that that is what it has done here.

23

Then next they can say a man is a

24 woman in Virginia.
25

ME. SCHWARTZ*

Congress probably could do

1

that, Ycur Honor, but again that is not the mode of

2 analysis by which we perceive Congress has used the term
3

"moving personal property" cr moving it itself.

We

4 think that that choice of language does not comfortably

5 apply to this process of abandoning capital facilities
6 and recreating new ones in new locations.

We would submit that at a minimum this

7

8 language "moving personal property" is sufficiently
9 ambiguous that it is not sufficient to stop with

the

10

statutory language, and it is sensible to go beyond it

11

and look at the usual indicia of legislative intent.
In this case the first thing we are confronted

12

13 by is the rather stark silence in the ten year long
14 legislative record, and I might add
15 of the

that representatives

American Right of Way Association which

16 represents the interests of the utilities insofar as
17 rights of way are concerned did speak at the hearings on
18

this.

But they never suggested that this statute would

19 or that it should alter the established common law
20
21

rule.
Accordingly, while this would be an easier

22 case if someone has said the obvious, it appears to us
23 that everyone understood that this issue, the question
24 of relocation assistance, was one that was governed by
25

well-established rule of state law and that absent any

20

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0900

a

1

indication of an intent to change it Congress must have

2 intended to leave it where it was especially because in
3

1956 in the Highway Act Congress had demonstrated that

4 it was aware of the state law rule and that it chose for

6 Highway Act purposes to defer to that state rule.
Now the Uniform Relocation Act does not say

6

7 except insofar as provided by other law the following
8

payments shall be made.

It says all federal acquisition

9 shall be controlled and federally assisted acquisitions
10 shall be controlled by this statutory scheme.

Given that, it is difficult for us to

11

12 understand why Congress apparently quite deliberately
13 left in effect provisions of the Highway Act which said
14 thou may pay relocation assistance but only if state law
15

provides for it.

If there were any question left in the

16

wake of that Act in 1972 when Congress turned to the

17 question again in the District of Columbia Public
18

Utilities Reimbursement Act when Congress provided

19 specifically for the purposes of interstate highways
20 that these monies should be paid, that portion of the
21

statute would have had precisely no effect and would

22 have been entirely superfluous if the Uniform Relocation

23

Act in

24

Highway Act.

25

1970 had set aside the rule cf Section 123 of the

As it happened. Congress did set aside ether

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

provisions of the Highway Act, Title 23, Sections 5C1

2 and the following sections which dealt with other
3

previsions of relocation assistance.

Sc one cannot even

4 say that Congress might have overlooked the Highway

Jet.

If you go through this statute and if you go

5

6 through the House and Senate committee reports you will
7 find an extraordinarily detailed listing set out in haec
8

verba of each of the statutory texts that was repealed
in many sections of the Highway Act that are to be found

10 there.
11

It is just very difficult for me to believe

12

that Congress just missed this.

13

Congress chose to leave Section 123 and its rule which

14

defers to state law in effect.

15
16

It appears that

There is another thing that one can garner
from looking at the several occasions on which Congress

17 has addressed the question of relocation assistance.
18 Congress has used different language to speak to this.
1

In the District of Columbia Act of

1972

20 Congress spoke of abandoning, relocating,
21

reconstructing, reestablishing, and used a large number

22 of terms which speak to the capital building process.
23

the Uniform

I wonder hew relevant it is if you

5 dc not really have any knowledge that the same
6 individuals on a committee compared the two and chcse to

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I think we have something

9 special because there are three stages to this.
10 is Section

123.

There

There is the Uniform Act, and there is

the D.C. Act while perhaps the action of one committee

12 in 1972 dees net say that much about what the 1970
13 Congress though

the entire statute that was enacted

14 would have been of no effect at all.
15

I would question whether we ought to attribute

16 that intent of Congress in

1972.

We would suggest that

17 when Congress wishes to address this subject it knows
18 how to dc so and that it did net do so in the Uniform
19 Relocation Act and that the judgment of the Court of
20 Appeals accordingly should be reversed.

MR. KELLY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

25 please the Court:

23

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

I believe we should first make quite clear

1

2 that there is no uncertainty on the record in this case
3 about the nature of the telephone company’s claim, the
4 nature of the expenses for which it claims.

There is no

5 need tc speculate from what is said in the briefs
6 whether they correctly described them.
Those claims were filed in the beginning and

7

8 have been in the possession of both Petitioner and the

federal defendant since that time and still are.

These

10 claims are for the nonbetterment cost of reconstructing,
11

the nonbetterment cost of moving utility lines, a

12 completely familiar concept that is observed and applied
13 every day.
14

It involves determining the true cost of

15 moving by starting with the cost of rebuilding which is
16 inevitably required whenever you move a utility line for
17 the most part unless there happened to be overhead poles
18 that can be moved or wires that can

be moved and used

again which would be exceptional.

But in all events in

1

20 the multitude of cases in which a utility company moves
21

its lines at the expense of someone else whether by

22 contract or under voluntary arrangement at the time the
23 parties well understood here from the beginning from the
24 time these claims were filed as they understood when
25 they stipulated that a similar expense if it happened to

2 case,

that the nonbetterment cost if it happened to be a

3 municipal line is part of the cost of the project cr is
4 carried as the city's share, I guess the city's share of
5 the total project cost.

So there should net be any uncertainty about

6

7 the fact that this case from the beginning has involved

8 claims for the relocation, for moving the lines in the
9 only sense in which the vicinities of most displaced

persons which happen to use heavy or large equipment and

11

structures which are not part of the land taken because

12

they are severed frem it by agreement cr by law.

As the

13 Fourth Circuit has determined it, these were severed by
14
15

law .
They were personal property.

Since they are

16 not taken, then the expense of moving them, relocating
17

their would be one of these inequitable expenses and

18 burdens borne by a particular class of people instead of

being borne —

It is not the cost that all utility companies

You must deduct from it the unused value, any

Nov you have got a proviso in (2),

8 on to say "but not to exceed an amount equal to the
9 reasonable expenses that would have been reqired

to

10 relocate such property as determined by the head of the

9 contend that the parties, the Petitioner and the
10 government, bound themselves by the legal conclusions
11 involved in the use of those terms.

12

It is highly significant, though, to my

13 contention that that is the usual and ordinary
14 acceptation of the word "moved its facilities” when we
15 are dealing with any displaced person whose facilities,
16 whose personal property includes property of

such

Well, how in the world can you say

you moved them?

You moved one that did not move.

KB. KELLY;

2

In the same sense in which we say

3 they rented the building.

The shed which one company

4 has rented and used for years to store machinery on the
5 land of another after which rebuilds on a new place

we

6 all say the company has moved its shed to the new
7 place.

QUESTION;

8

I guess if we can put a grain

9 elevator into Commerce we can do that.

MB. KELLY;

10
11

It is indeed possible and under

this view of what is meant by "moved" the utility

12 companies and all other displaced companies including
13

the chainsaw company involved in the Eeaird-Foulan case

14 discussed where they moved plant.

They did not pick

15 that plant up and move it, Your Honor.

They did not pick much up and move it.

16

They

17 moved a whole plant, and the Court concluded that the
18

Beaird-Foulan moved.

It is also the answer to the

19 suggestion that maybe you have to move your entire
20 business.

21

The chain saw plant was most assuredly not the

22 only business of the Emerson Company.
23

That is why the

statute was sc careful to define what activity is, what

24 a business means.

It means any activity conducted for a

25 business purpose.

38

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

That activity was moved.

1

Whether we all cculd

2 agree that the company moved that is what everyone would
3 say in common parlance and that the power line was
4 moved,

the underground lines were moved, that is what

5 everyone would say in common parlance.

We say that is

6 what the Act meant.
Whether we cculd all agree on that or not,

7

8 most assuredly the activity was moved to the new

location.

I trust the Court understands that from the

10 time when the claims were first filed right through — I
11

cannot recall hew many years of administrative

12 consideration of those claims — two years in the trial
13 court, a total of three years in litigation, the parties
14 seem to be fully agreed that we had moved the lines and
16 that we had moved.

There was never any contention to

16 the contrary ever asserted.
That continued to be true down through the

17

18 time when the government’s first brief was filed.
1

Having declined to join in a petition for writ of error,

20 the government’s position was not quite fully stated
21

just new by the Solicitor General.

22

The statement there twice was that the plain

23 terms of the Act that the Court of Appeals had merely
24 followed the plain terms of the Act.

Nothing has

25 happen ed.

39

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

At that point the Department of Justice had

1
2

been defending this litigation on behalf cf the Cnited

3 States for more than three years.

It has in the trial

4 court supported the administrative interpretation until
5 the Fourth Circuit held that it was contrary to the
6 plain terms of the Act after which the Solicitor General
7 concluded and informed the Court in its brief in
8

opposition that the Court of Appeals cannot be said to
have erred in following the plain language of the Act

10 and that the arguments to the contrary of the Petitioner
11

and amicus supporting the Petitioner were made despite

12

the Act’s plain terms.
Nothing has been said to explain how in the

13

14 next five months the Act's plain terms became any less
15 plain.

I think attention should be called to the

16 anomolous Constances that would arise out of any
17

interpretation of the word "move personal property" in

18 this or move property that would limit it to the case
1
20
21

when it can be bodily transplanted.
The law was never intended to treat
differently the power company, the gas company that

22 takes up his lines and moves them and uses them again
23 and the one where it is not feasible and not sensible to
24 do that and puts new ones in the new place and recovers
25 compensation only for the difference between the old and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS N. CRENSHAW, ESQ

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. CRENSHAW:

8

9 if I might, sir.

I have just a couple of words

I would like to call to the Co urt’s

10 attention that the complaint at paragraph 7 alle ges that

11

these lines were moved.

2

The Redevelopment Authority's answer a t

3 paragraph 7 denies those allegations.

The stipu laticn

4 -- That is at page 21 of the Joint Appendix — w hich
5 refers to the term "relocated facilities" is the cables ,

pcles, or other equipment which CflE has r emeved.
Then we stipulate that then any that h ave teen

8 removed were removed subject January the 2nd.

we have articulated well our argument on r emoval,

20 but it certainly has been in the case.

The second thing I would like to say i s that

22 this statute was passed to supplement benefits o f people
23 whose private property was taken.

In this case we a re

It is a political subdivision of the

It is still public property.
Nowhere in this are we talking about taking a

6 compensible property interest, and the telephone company
7 has not cited and I do not believe they can cite any
8 case in which benefits under the relocation statute are

conferred unless there is the acquisition of a
10 compensible interest in real property.
11

We think the

claim should be denied.
