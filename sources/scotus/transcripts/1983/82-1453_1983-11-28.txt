CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Fredericks, I think

you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY I. FREDERICKS, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6
7

MR. FREDERICKS:

and may it please the Court:

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

This matter comes to the Court from an appeal
from the Third Circuit.

The facts in the case are not in

10

dispute.

11

presented here today.

12

whether an individual who has initially filed a fraudulent

13

tax return and subsequently comes forth and files an

14

amended tax return, whether by that act he begins the

15

running of the three-year statute of limitations

16

applicable under the Internal Revenue Code or, as the

17

government alleges, he is forever open to an assessment of

18

tax upon the filing of the initial fraudulent return.

19

Basically it is a simple legal issue that is

QUESTION:

Simply put the question is one of

Where would your argument take you if

20

when the amended return was offered, tendered, the

21

Commissioner refused to accept it?

22

MR. FREDERICKS:

I think, Your Honor, under that

23

point the government could argue that there was no amended

24

return filed and I think that we would be in a very

25

difficult position to start the running of the amended

1

return.

2

amended return is not filed.

3

The government could, I would think, say that the

In this case and the cases that have taken place

4

in the Second, Fifth, and Tenth Circuits that is not the

5

facts that we have to deal with.

6

cases, the amended return was taken and the tax that was

7

due on the amended return was collected by the Internal

8

Revenue Service.

9
10

QUESTION:

In fact, in all of those

Do you think that would bar them from

taking any other position, is that your point?

11

MR. FREDERICKS:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. FREDERICKS:

Well —

By taking the amended return?
I think that the issue of the

14

amended return is one that the government presses, which I

15

have always thought has been a question of an ostrich type

16

argument insofar as they can deny the existence of an

17

amended return except that the Internal Revenue Code at

18

length refers to an amended returns and it is a practice

19

that has been going on for some time and has been

20

recognized by the courts and in many cases, has been used

21

by the government in connection with their criminal

22

prosecution of people who have been filing fraudulent tax

23

returns in the first instance.

24

The Dowell case and the Klemp case, I believe,

25

in both instances the government used the amended return

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

as part of their case in chief to establish the question

2

of fraud.

3

I think the question the Chief Judge poses is an

4

interesting one.

5

what would happen if the government refused to accept that

6

amended return, which they may or may not have a right to

7

do.

8

issue as has been presented that has not been the

9

situation.

10

I really can't answer the question of

But, in this case and in the cases that have the

The amended return has been fully accepted by

the government.

11

And, we suggest that upon the filing of that

12

amended return that the Tax Court ruling in Bennett, which

13

was decided in 1958, and acquiesced in by the United

14

States government, which was a case of the fraudulent

15

failure to file a tax return at all and a criminal

16

prosecution of that taxpayer for fraudulently failing to

17

file.

18

In a subsequent filing of a non-fraudulent

19

return, the Tax Court and the government concluded that at

20

that point the three-year statute of limitations provided

21

in 6501(a) began to run.

22
23
24
25

I suggest that there is no basis to distinguish
that case from the case at bar.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Fredericks, the language of

the two subsections is different.

1

MR. FREDERICKS:

2

QUESTION:

I respectfully —

In the case of the orginal non-filing

3

of a return, the section says within three years after the

4

return is filed.

5

There is language that doesn't appear.

MR. FREDERICKS:

No.

I think the subsection

6

language is not different, Your Honor.

7

language, (c)(3) and (c)(1), are identical.

8

provide that the statute shall not run —

9

QUESTION:

The subsection
They both

Well, the language in 6501(a) does

10

say that the tax will be assessed within three years after

11

the return is filed, does it not?

12

MR. FREDERICKS:

13

QUESTION:

That is correct.

And that language would then apply

14

where there is originally no return filed, but later one

15

is filed.

16

with the language for the fraudulent return that is filed

17

and subsequently an honest return filed, the language is

18

so different that I don't see how you can make the

19

argument you are making.

20

Now, I don't see how, when you compare that

MR. LAUDER:

Well, I don't believe you — the

21

language in 6501(c)(1) and (3) are identical.

22

are referring to

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FREDERICKS:

25

What you

Right.
— is the initial language in

the first section as to the statute of limitations.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. FREDERICKS:

That is right.
And, I would suggest, Your

3

Honor, that one must go back to 1918 when the statute was

4

first enacted and at that time Congress provided a

6

five-year statute of limitations and an exemption in the

6

case of filing a fraudulent tax return.

7

made at all on failure to file.

8
9

No mention was

In 1921, Congress then enacted what is now the
predecessor of the sections we are dealing with.

And, it

10

said the fraudulent failure to file or — I am sorry, the

11

filing of a fraudulent return or the failure to file in a

12

single sentence.

13

intention by Congress to deal with these two situations

14

identically.

And, I suggest that that indicated an

15

In fact, all of the Circuit Courts that have

16

considered this matter have all concluded that the two

17

sections must be read in pari materia.

18

is in question here.

19

I don't think that

It is only in 1954 when the '54 Code comes into

20

being that the two section, which were in one sentence,

21

were split into two sections.

22

substantial legislative history one way or the other to

23

indicate why.

24
25

And, there is no

I suggest that the legislative history, which
indicates that both of these sections were to be

identically when they were initially enacted, indicates
there should be identical treatment.

Therefore, when one

fraudulently seeks to evade the tax law by failing to
fraudulently a tax return —
QUESTION:

By failing to fraudulently file a tax

return?
MR. FREDERICKS:
were then.

Well, that is what the facts

The taxpayer, with an intent to evade the tax,

filed a return.
QUESTION:

Isn't there a difference between

failing to fraudulently file and fraudulently failing to
file?

I mean, failing to fraudulently file to me means —
MR. FREDERICKS:
QUESTION:

No, no, I am sorry.

— that you had planned to file a

fraudulent report, but you didn't.
MR. FREDERICKS:

I am sorry.

What the Bennett

taxpayer did was with the intent to evade the tax, with
the fraudulent intent failed to file the return.
What the taxpayers in this case did was file the
fraudulently return and subsequently filed an amended
return.

I suggest —
QUESTION:

Well, now, if a taxpayer simply

negligently, not fraudulently, failed to include more than
25 percent of the income, then there is a six-year statute
of limitations, right?

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

MR. FREDERICKS:

Which begins to run from the

2

day that return is filed irrespective of whatever

3

transpires, that is correct.

4

QUESTION:

But, under you theory, you would be

5

better off if you had a fraudulently intent than a

6

negligent intent because then it would just be a

7

three-year statute of limitations.

8

MR. FREDERICKS:

That is not true at all,

9

because if you filed and it was fraudulent you have two

10

other things, three things that have to come into play.

11

One, that you would be subject to criminal prosecution.

12

You would have six years in which the government could

13

indict you and try you.

14
15

Two, you would be subject to the 50 percent
penalty.

16

And, three, in order to have a statute of

17

limitations to begin at all, you would have had to have

18

filed an amended return.

19

Yes, if the fraudulent return was filed on April

20

15th and the amended return was filed on April 16th, now

21

in that case there is no running of a statute from our

22

position.

23

That taxpayer might be in better position than the fellow

24

who negligently forgot his 25 percent, but that taxpayer

25

came in immediately, rectified his situation, and gave the

The 16th for three years would begin to run.

2

government the information it had.
QUESTION:

But, that difference and the fact

3

that the Congress treated the negligent omission

4

differently does give some meaning to the language that I

5

referred to early.

6

little better, doesn't it, if that is the case?

7

I mean, the scheme holds together a

MR. FREDERICKS:

I suggest not for this reason.

8

Congress — There is some legislative history on the

9

six-year — the reason for the six-year statute of

10

limitations and that was that begins to run from the day

11

it is filed whether the government discovers it or not.

12

So, the government, without having the benefit of the

13

information, has got a six-year statute running on it and,

14

therefore, Congress said we are going to give them

15

additional time to catch up this possible mistake if it

16

was negligent.

17

no statute of limitations of any kind.

18

Obvioulsy, if it is fraudulent, there is

QUESTION:

Mr. Fredericks, can I ask on that

19

point, what is the law with respect to this situation?

20

Suppose you negligently file a return with more than a 25

21

percent — you have got six years.

Then six months later

22

you file a correct amended return.

What is the statute of

23

limitations?

24
25

MR. FREDERICKS:

The statute of limitations on

that is six years.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. FREDERICKS:

3

The Court's ruling is that

since it is a running statute that no act, be it either —

4
5

Still six years.

QUESTION:

Those holdings are somewhat

inconsistent with your position then.

6

MR. FREDERICKS:

I think not.

I think not,

7

because the statute is already running.

8

that there is no statute running.

9

Bennett, where the filing of what the government

Our position is

We are saying, as in

10

characterizes as a delinquent return now starts the

11

statute.

12

starts the statute.

13

So, in my case, the filing of the amended return

In the 25 percent case, that statute begins to

14

run the day the return is filed, whether the government

15

discovers it or doesn't discover it, no matter what

16

happens, and neither the taxpayer nor the government can

17

stay off the running of that statute.

18

In our case, the government's position is that

19

they have forever, literally forever, because if you buy

20

the government's position, the taxpayer can have died, his

21

estate could have been passed on to three generations and

22

still the statute of limitations on transferees don't

23

begin to run until one year after the initial statute

24

would begin to run.

25

generations to assess this tax if they so choose.

The government can go on down three

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

The other problem that we suggest exists is that

2

by not having a statute of limitations of any kind the

3

government is in a situation where they can come in after

4

the amended tax return has been filed and make numerous

5

denials of deductions claimed by the taxpayer and then

6

that burden shifts to the taxpayer, which is exactly what

7

happened in this situation.

8

of proof of establishing the propriety of certain

9

deductions that he has made.

10

The taxpayer has the burden

Having now been ten years down the road we run

11

into the very reason that this Court says that statute of

12

limitations exist so that no issue shall be tried at a

13

time when evidence disappears, memories fade, and

14

witnesses are not available.

15

To give the government an open-ended position

16

after the amended return comes in, we suggest opens up a

17

substantial area of government abuse and we suggest that

18

when the government says —

19

QUESTION:

Of course, if that is the rule, Mr.

20

Fredericks, I suppose the taxpayer has it within his

21

control to avoid that abuse by simply not filing an

22

amended return after he has filed a fraudulent return.

23

MR. FREDERICKS:

Well, by not filing the amended

24

and taking the risk of non-disclosure.

QUESTION:

Yes.

He presumably took that risk in

the first instance when he filed the fraudulent return.

3

MR. FREDERICKS:

Well, that comes another way

4

around.

6

this Court has said many times, upon the voluntary

6

assessment of the- taxpayer of his tax, and in this case, a

7

reassessment, we suggest, that I think your question

8

highlights very nicely, that to take the government's

9

position puts a premium on silence.

Since our policy for taxation is really based, as

It says to the

10

taxpayer, don't file the amended return because you have

16

If anything, you are going to make an

Well, that is true of almost anybody

20

to rather extensive liability and there is very little way

21

to recover from that.

11

Here is a situation where the taxpayer has come

for the open-ended statute of limitations suggested by the

15

government.

He has given them

Now, they still have their criminal remedy.

We

17

are not suggesting for one moment that the filing of the

18

amended tax return deprives the government of its right to

19

prosecute the individual criminally or to impose its civil

20

50 percent penalty.

21

What we are suggesting is that the filing of the

22

amended return, as in the case of Bennett, the filing of

23

what the government called a delinquent return, should

24

prevent the government from sitting on their hands forever

25

and a day until they decide they want to take action,

particularly when that delay results in substantial

2

prejudice to this taxpayer who has now gone through a

3

self-assessment and has filed his return.

4

government policy that warrants such an open-ended civil

5

statute of limitations.

6

The gov-ernment disagrees.

There is no

needs this in order to allow them to proceed with their

criminal investigation.

9

not the case.

We suggest that that is really

Certainly the criminal investigation, at

10

the time that the government has referred the matter to

11

the Department of Justice for criminal investigation, they

12

will have gathered enough information to meet the civil

13

burden which is far less than their criminal burden.

14

Secondly, the amended return gives the

15

government one advantage.

16

interest by the would-be defendant to which they can

17

compare with the original return and clearly determine

18

right from the face of the amended return where the fraud

19

was and in what directions they have to go.

20

It has an admission against

At the time that the government seeks an

21

indictment, it certainly has a more than prima facie case.

22

The government believes at the time it returns an

beyond a reasonable doubt.

25

is substantially less than that.

Has there been any indictment against

either of these taxpayers?

forth and filed their amended returns.

10

The initial — Badaracco was,

Deleet was a

There has never

been a criminal prosecution in that regard.

11

But the point that we are making is that there

12

is no need for the government to sit back and wait on

13

these type of situations, particularly when armed with the

14

amended return.

15

prosecutions against the taxpayer.

16

the civil side to wait when it is clearly going to

17

prejudice the taxpayer, we suggest is illogical and

18

unconscionable.

19

They have used the return in criminal
And, to allow them on

I mean, Bennett was a classic case of a criminal

20

who was indicted, who had committed tax fraud, and the

21

court said, well, once you filed a return and have given

22

the government the very information it needs to apply the

23

tax, there is no reason to keep the statute of limitations

24

open.

25

Might I also add the Bennett case also dealt

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

with the very problem that was raised about the 25 percent

2

taxpayer and the government acquiesced in that situation

3

and there was no question that in the Bennett decision

4

they dealt with this problem and concluded that the 25

5

percent situation didn't affect their ability to deal with

6

the problem of the fraudulent non-filing.

7

And, also the Bennett case, again which

8

acquiesced in by the government in 1958, concluded that

9

Congress intended to have these two sections dealt with

10

identically.

11

to reach the conclusion it did, that these two sections

12

were determined by Congress to be equally treated.

13

In fact, it used it as part of its reasoning

Now, the Bennett case is almost identical to the

14

case at bar with one minor exception and that is in

15

Bennett the taxpayer filed nothing and in this case the

16

taxpayer filed a return.

17

filed a delinquent return and one filed an amended return

18

and we suggest tht there is no logical, legal reason to

19

make a distinction and say that a fraudulent non-filer

20

who files is entitled to the benefit of a statute of

21

limitations, acquiesced in by the government.

22

And, then in both instances, one

In 1979 it sent out a Revenue ruling which

23

expressly took that position.

It said clearly that a

24

fraudulent non-filer was entitled to the benefit of the

25

statute of limitations upon filing a return.

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

We suggest that there is no distinction between

2

that case that is supported in either logic or law to say

3

that a fraudulent filer who files an amended return

4

shouldn't be treated in the same light and under the same

5

circumstances.

6

And there is nothing in the policy

7

MR. FREDERICKS:

Certainly

Yes, but the — There is no

MR. FREDERICKS:

No, I didn't.

MR. FREDERICKS:

that your argument?

12

MR. FREDERICKS:

Why isn't

It is my argument based upon

13

Bennett.

14

because Bennett has decided the prior situation of the

15

failure to file and if you analogize that the fraudulent

16

return is not a return, then you fail to file, and once

17

you file the amended return you are right within the

square corners of Bennett.

MR. FREDERICKS:

No.

I adopt the argument of

6

the Tenth Circuit- and that was the argument that they made

in their opinion; that the return, the initial return was

8

not a Zellerbach return, it wasn't an honest evidence to

9

file a return and it was the amended return that was, in

10
11

fact, the first return filed.
I suggest that is in keeping with the position

12

we have taken in Bennett and which the government has

13

acquiesced and the logic of Bennett carries right through

14

to that direction.

15

But, I certainly suggest that a return, an

16

amended return can be reviewed as a return under the

statute and then within the arguments of 6501(a) as taking

this out of the exceptions that follow.

When one recalls that —

Why are

you so sure of that?

7

MR. LAUBER:

Couldn't one say that the amended

"the return," and the Court early on —

20

MR. LAUBER:

In your view, is an amended

Our view is that an amended return,

if accepted by the Commissioner, is a return for the tax

22

year, but it is not the return referred to in (a).

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. LAUBER:

Right.

That is because Congress, by using

a definite article, we think, indicated that it meant the

But, it wouldn't be quite as clear.
It wouldn't be quite as clear.
You place a lot of weight on "the."

MR. LAUBER:

It would give us only one string

rather than two to our bow which I think we have now.
But, one recalls that as this Court has held a

13

limitations period must be construed strictly in favor of

14

the government.

15

here, given a natural reading, indicates that once a false

16

return has been filed, the Commissioner has an unlimited

17

period to assess the tax, whatever the taxpayer does.

18

We think the plain language of the Code

We think this natural reading of the statute is

19

confirmed if one looks to the structure and operation of

20

other Code provisions.

21

To begin with it is clear that a taxpayer who

22

has filed a false return remains liable for criminal and

23

civil fraud penalties on that account regardless of later

24

repentant conduct.

25

fraudulent return is filed.

The fraud is complete when the

1

In short, the case remains a case of a false or

2

fraudulent return despite the filing of an honest amended

3

return indefinitely for purposes of imposing substantive

4

fraud liability.

5

that that the case should also remain a case —

6

We think it is logical to infer from

QUESTION:

It just doesn't make any difference

7

where you got your information that a fraud had been

8

committed.

9

You may have gotten it from an amended return.
MR. LAUBER:

Or from an anonymous tip or a third

10

party or bank or an accounting firm or anyone.

11

it is just another form of information the Commissioner

12

has to process in doing its fraud investigation.

13

QUESTION:

We think

In assessing any additional taxes in

either one of these cases, is there additional taxes

1

MR. LAUBER:

QUESTION:

MR. LAUBER:

Yes, we could have.
Why?
Because the Commission is empowered

Well, I know, but there may be — You

14

MR. LAUBER:
Justice White.

That is what happened in Deleet,

What Deleet did —

QUESTION:

How can you do that after three years

from the amended return?
MR. LAUBER:

Why?

Because the amended return,

15

we submit, has no relevance in determining the limitations

16

period in fraud cases.

17

The statute says "at any time."

What happened in the Deleet case was the amended

18

return reported the omitted gross income of the

19

corporation, but it also claimed a deduction in the exact

20

same amount.

21

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me arguably at

22

least there could be a difference between assessing more

23

taxes than shown on the amended return and assessing some

24

penalty for the fraud that was committed prior.

25

MR. LAUBER:

No, there cannot, Justice White,

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

because, as counsel for Petitioner —

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. LAUBER:

Well, that is your position.
Well, Congress might have done

that, but they didn't, because a fraud penalty is a

colloquial phrase to refer to an addition to the tax on

account of fraud.-

I understand that.
It is all one ball of wax.
Suppose you hadn't attempted to

are assessing additional taxes.

know, ten years later decide he overdeducted something
like his automobile expense.

11

MR. LAUBER:

12

incorrectly computed his fraud penalty because if we audit

13

the return further and determine that he got the

14

deficiency wrong, although he tried to be honest, he got

15

it wrong, he got the fraud penalty wrong too.

16

QUESTION:

He said the fraud penalty only gave

Now, because amended returns are not part of the

QUESTION:

Mr. Lauber, may I ask you whether

2

fraud is easier to detect or to prove in the Bennett

3

situation than in the situation involved in these cases?

4

MR. LAUBER:

Well, Bennett is where there is

5

fraudulent failure to file any return at all.

6

would have to say it is not easier to detect fraud there.

7

But, what happens in practice is the Commissioner brings

8

very, very few actions, prosecutions on the criminal front

9

for fraudulent non-filing.

I guess I

The reason for that is that it

10

is very hard to get a jury to buy the fact that a guy

11

committed fraud if he did nothing at all.

12

there are only a handful of those prosecutions.

13

So, in fact,

What the government does is alternatively bring

14

a prosecution for willful failure to file where fraud need

15

not be proven and this is only a misdemeanor rather than a

16

felony.

17
18
19

So, in practice, the way we deal with that
problem is to go the other route.
QUESTION:

What are the — What element is

20

fraudulent failure to file have in it that a willful fail

21

to file doesn't?

22

MR. LAUBER:

Well, it is hard to make up a jury

23

instruction on that.

24

violation of a known legal duty and fraud connotes

25

something about bad acts beyond that.

Willfull, I guess, is intentional

QUESTION:

But, fraud connotes intention to

deceive, doesn't it?
MR. LAUBER:

Yes.

But, in effect, the

4

Commissioner generally does not indict for fraudulent

5

failure to file.

6

Now, of- course, the Petitioners, of course,

7

base their entire case on tax policy.

once the Commissioner has an amended return that

ultimately turns out to be non-fraudulent, he doesn't need

Their view is that

At that point, Petitioners contend that the

12

Commissioner's fraud investigation should be limited by

13

the three-year rule that applies in non-fraud cases.

14

think this argument is wrong and that the Court of Appeals

15

was correct in determining that, in fact, strong reasons

16

of tax policy support a plain reading of the statute.

17

We

18

however honest it ultimately proves to be, does not really

23

intent and because fraud is often accompanied by its

24

badges such the falsification or destruction of records.

25

Beyond that the Commissioner has the burden of

2

Congress to enact the at-any-time rule in fraud cases

3

persists even though the taxpayer files an amended return.

4

The case is still a fraud case with all the attendant

problems of examination and the Commissioner still has the

burden of proof. ' An amended return comes with no

10

But, the reasons that lead

Indeed, it comes from a taxpayer who

That point might be illustrated by the facts of

We think it is clear that it could not possibly

2

be contended that had the Commissioner got this useful,

3

correct information from a third party, the three-year

4

rule would then all of a sudden applied in the fraud case.

5

We think there is no reason on grounds of tax policy for a

6

different result merely because that data happens to be

7

contained in the vehicle of an amended return.

8
9

In short, our view is that the Commissioner's
need for an unlimited period of assessment in fraud cases

10

is not materially diminished by the filing of an amended

11

return.

12

amended returns of all the manifold documents and data

13

that might bear on tax fraud has the unique effect, the

14

singular effect, of shortening to three years the

15

unlimited period that governs fraud cases generally.

16

And, we think there is no reason to hold that

We think there is a second and discreet reason

17

for holding on grounds of tax policy, that the three-year

rule should not come into play in tax fraud cases.

20

tax enforcement.

21

This

22

has charged the Commissioner with pursuing both criminal

23

and civil aspects in tax fraud.

2

sound tax administration for the Commissioner to close

down his civil audit within three years of getting an

The practical problems here we think are fairly

evident.

information from the taxpayer.

16

This result is required by LaSalle Bank, from

But, that means, having lost the summons

But, apart from these practical problems, the

17

Commissioner has long had a policy of suspending civil

18

audit pending the completion of criminal proceedings.

19

This policy is set forth in the Internal Revenue Manual

20

and it stems from the difficulty of conducting at the same

21

time a civil tax fraud litigation while a criminal tax

22

fraud investigation is continuing.

23

And, the most obvious problem, of course, is the

24

risk of killing the criminal case by making a premature

25

disclosure of evidence to the potential defendant.

39

1

If the three-year rule is held to apply here,

2

the Commissioner, right in the middle of his criminal tax

3

fraud investigation, is going to have to send a notice of

4

deficiency to the taxpayer asserting civil tax fraud.

5

taxpayer will then go into Tax Court or the District Court

6

and the Commissioner will be required by the rules of

7

those Courts to allege fraud affirmatively in the answer

8

and then be subject to discovery, interrogatories and

9

depositions, about his fraud theory.

The

10

I think it is pretty clear that if the

11

Commissioner is required to open up his files right in the

12

middle of the on-going criminal investigation, laying out

13

his theory of fraud and the fact he expects to rely on in

14

proving fraud, that criminal case could probably be

15

killed.

16

Beyond that, we think there are other problems

17

in maintaining an on-going criminal investigation and a

18

parallel civil tax fraud litgation.

19

the taxpayer, for example, will probably assert the Fifth

20

Amendment privilege barring any introduction of evidence

21

on the issue of fraud.

22

In the civil case,

There could be problems with witnesses because

23

of the premature disclosure of their names through

24

potential defendant and finally there can be problems

25

where the taxpayer puts up a defense as a beleaguered

defendant in a criminal action asserting the Commissioner

2

is tyring to dun him on five different fronts at once,

3

grab his money, and juries occasionally have been

4

persuaded by that kind of evidence.

5

So, for all these reasons, we think that the

6

Commissioner's policy of suspending civil tax audit until

7

the completion of criminal proceedings is salutary both on

8

grounds of fairness to the taxpayer and on grounds of

9

sensible administration of the tax laws.

10

Petitioners'

argument here would effectively kill that policy.

one question that Justice White asked about the imposition

I think the

Section 6635(b) of the Code does not necessarily indicate

that the tax can be assessed at any time under Section

penalty for underpayment due to fraud.
