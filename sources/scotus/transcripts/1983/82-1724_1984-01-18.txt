CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. ARCARA, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. ARCARA:

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The present cases are before you on a writ of

8
9

Mr. Arcara, you may

certiorari to the New York Court of Appeals.

That Court,

10

in a memorandum decision last year, found unconstitutional

11

New York Penal Law, Section 235.40, Subdivision 3.

12

statute is generally referred to as the loitering statute

13

in New York and it generally prohibits individuals from

14

loitering or remaining at a public place —

Mr. Arcara, can I ask you a question

16

about the procedural posture of this case?

Buffalo.

MR. ARCARA:

QUESTION:

21

You are the

That is correct, Your Honor.
And you represent the state in this

case.

22

MR. ARCARA:

23

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
Now, the Attorney General of New York

24

has apparently taken a partial fall in this case.

25

filed a brief where he says, you know, maybe to minors,

He has

Now, you are speaking to the State of New York in

2

this case, not him, I take it.

MR. ARCARA:

Generally that statute prohibits individuals

from —

You are not speaking for the Attorney

General of New York though?
MR. ARCARA:

8
9

That is correct, Your Honor.

No, I disagree with the Attorney

General.

10

QUESTION:

I know, I know you do, but he —

11

MR. ARCARA:

Your Honor, he doesn't have the

12

responsibility of enforcing this law either.

13

like to point that back out.

14

enforcing this law and I have no knowledge —
QUESTION:

15

I have the responsibility of

You have the authority to represent

17

Can't you just speak for the county or what?

20

I would also

You can't speak for the State of New York, can you?

MR. ARCARA:

No, Your Honor, I am speaking on

behalf of the State of New York.
QUESTION:

For the state, because you have the

authority to do that?

1

MR. ARCARA:

That is correct, Your Honor.

2

And, by the way, I might add that I had no

3

knowledge that the Attorney General was going to file

4

their brief until the day in which the Respondents were to

5

file their brief.

6

notice at all that the Attorney General was going to take

7

this position, contrary to mine.

8

to participate in this case at the Court of Appeals and he

9

refused.

10

That is the first time that I had any

In fact, he was invited

So, this case came —
QUESTION:

Mr. Arcara, do you have some state

11

requirement that the Attorney General has to be vouched in

12

whenever their is an attack on the constitutionality of a

13

New York statute?

14

MR. ARCARA:

Under the executive law, Your

15

Honor, it says that the Attorney General can appear in

16

court to defend the constitutionality of a statute.

17

QUESTION:

No.

My question was — Some states

18

have statutes which provide that in any action in the

19

state, a question of the constitutionality of a state

20

statute is raised, then the parties must vouch the

21

Attorney General into the case to let him come in and

22

defend the constitutionality of the statute.

23
24
25

MR. ARCARA:

Your Honor, he has that option.

He

can either appear to defend the —
QUESTION:

Are you required to give him notice?

1

2

MR. ARCARA:

We did give him notice in this

case, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

Aren't you required to if the

4

constitutionality of a law is at stake and then he has the

5

option.

6

MR. ARCARA:

That is correct, Your Honor.

He

7

has refrained from exercising that option until the case

8

came before this Court.

9
10

11
12
13

QUESTION:

So, after he got the notice, he never

told you he was going to appear in the case?
MR. ARCARA:

No, he didn't, Your Honor.

I had

no knowledge.
This statute, generally referred to as the

14

loitering statute, prohibits individuals from loitering or

15

remaining in a public place for the purpose of soliciting

16

or engaging in deviate sexual intercourse or other sexual

17

behavior of a deviate nature.

18
19

20

Now, briefly the fact underlying the two cases
before the Court are as follows:
The Respondent Butler, who was a known

21

prostitute by the Buffalo Police Department, was observed

22

for approximately ten minutes on a public street in the

23

City of Buffalo waving at passing automobiles.

24

ultimately entered one of those automobiles which then

25

proceeded down a side street.

She

The police officer who was making those

1
2

observations then went to where that car was parked and

3

observed the Respondent Susan Butler engaged in an act of

4

oral sodomy with the driver of that vehicle.

5

arrested under the loitering statute.

She was then

6

Mr. Uplinger was arrested on a public street in

7

a quiet residential area of the City of Buffalo following

8

a direct and overt solicitation to a plain clothes Buffalo

9

police officer to engage in an act of oral sodomy.
The police action in both of these cases was the

10

11

result of a reaction by the Police Department to citizen

12

complaints of these type of activities occurring in those

13

two respective neighborhoods.
I will go into a little more detail of the facts

14
15

of the case during the course of my argument.
At issue here is whether or not this statute

16
17

represents a valid attempt by the state to control public

18

order.

19

Our position as the Petitioner is that the state

20

enactment is valid.

21

compelling interest in the control of the conduct that it

22

prescribes.

23

It is based upon a legitimate and a

Now, with regard to the compelling state

24

interest, first I submit that the solicitations we are

25

talking about here constitute a real harassment.

They are

1

a real annoyance to a general public.

2

conversations of the most intimate nature.

3

most private of matters and they are delivered in a public

4

form.

5

QUESTION:

They are
They are the

Well, Mr. Arcara, that may be true,

6

but apparently the New York Court of Appeals placed the

7

construction on the purpose of this statute that was more

8

limited than that said that it was not a statute intended

9

to protect the harassment of other people in the vicinity,

10

but rather was in the nature of the companion attempt

11

statute to another law which New York, of course, had held

12

unconstitutional.
Are we bound by the determination of the state

13
14

court as to the purpose of this statute?
MR. ARCARA:

15
16

No, Justice O'Connor.

I dealt with

that issue on page four of my reply brief.
QUESTION:

17

Well, I was afraid you might have

18

dealt with it incorrectly and that is why I asked the

19

question.

20

MR. ARCARA:

Well, Your Honor, I submit that the

21

Court of Appeals applied no statutory construction to that

22

statute. They merely invalidated it in toto and then they

23

gave some reasons for it which I submit —

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, the Court gave — spelled out

what it said the purpose was and was not.

Are we bound by

1

that?
QUESTION:

2

No, Your Honor, because the Court, in

3

making its finding, relied upon the Onofre decision and

4

that decision relied upon the right of privacy and the

5

equal protection clause.

6

federal Constitution regarding the applicablity of that

7

statute to the state law.

8

final arbiter as to whether or not the federal

9

Constitution, as it is applied to a state court, was

10

applied correctly.

11

correctly.

I submit that this court is the

And, I submit they did not apply it

QUESTION:

12

And, they interpreted the

Do you think in interpreting the New

13

York Court of Appeals opinion we may read the opinion in

14

this case in the light of its Onofre opinion?
MR. ARCARA:

15

Well, Your Honor, I don't think you

16

have to.

I think we are talking about here a public

17

nuisance and I personally think that the Onofre decision

18

was totally another matter.

19

in that case — that dealt with private acts, adults in a

20

private setting.

21

statute on a public street in a public area that is

22

annoying to the public at large and it is so offensive.

23

I submit the legislature had a right to enact

The right of privacy they use

Here we are talking about a harassment

24

this law and to protect the public from these types of

25

infringements on their rights.

QUESTION:

1

Counsel, here we are dealing with an

2

opinion of New York's highest court that is a little over

3

a page long.

4

MR. ARCARA:

5

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
And, it doesn't cite any

6

constitutional provision.

7

one is to go back and look at People versus Onofre, which

8

they refer to, it is almost impossible to tell on what

9

grounds they did away with this statute.
MR. ARCARA:

10

11
12

13
14

It cites the penal law.

Unless

It is very difficult, Your Honor, I

agree.
QUESTION:

So then don't you think People

against Onofre sheds some light on it?
MR. ARCARA:

Well, People versus Onofre dealt

15

with the right of privacy and equal protection.

16

don't believe the right of privacy, the home, in the

17

private setting of a home between consenting adults would

18

apply to the privacy that a person is entitled to on a

19

public street.

20
21

And, secondly, the equal protection clause, I
don't think, has any application here whatsoever.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. ARCARA:

24

QUESTION:

25

And, I

Well, this Court denied cert on that.
That is correct, Your Honor.
Do you think the New York Court of

Appeals held this statute was unconstitutional?

1

MR. ARCARA:

2

QUESTION:

3

It would have to, Your Honor.
Well, I would think it would have to,

but it doesn't say so.
MR. ARCARA:

4

Well, it is very difficult.

I

5

wrestled with that decisions for many, many hours as to

6

what they were trying to say.

7

anything to try to construct that statute in harmony with

8

the Constitution.

9

the law was.

I don't think they did

)

They didn't look to what the intent of

They didn't care what the purpose of the law

10

was.

11

this was an act that was anticipatory of a legal act and,

12

therefore, we are going to pite it as unconstitutional.

13
14
15

They just kind, in a summary fashion, of just said

QUESTION:

What did the dissenting judge think

they acted on?
MR. ARCARA:

He thinks that they acted on the

16

overbreadth; that they felt —Justice Jasen felt that the

17

Court was applying the law from the setting of a private

18

setting of a home or private residence to the street and

19

he felt it was an overbroad interpretation of the statute.

20

QUESTION:

Well, possibly the Court based it on

21

either the right of privacy inquiry or possibly a First

22

Amendment problem, is that right?

23

MR. ARCARA:

I don't believe there is any

24

reference at all to the First Amendment.

25

that was the case at all, Your Honor.

I don't believe

It is strictly

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

dealt with the right of privacy — Well, in conjunction
with the First Amendment, I am sorry —

And, as far as

the equal protection clause is concerned.
QUESTION:

Now, the only intimation I find in

the opinion of the New York Court of Appeals in this case
as to some constitutional ground is it says this statute,
therefore, suffers the same deficiencies as did the
consensual sodomy statute.

Now, that takes you back to

Onofre and there they are talking about federal
Constitution rights.
It seems to me that your best chance to get a
review of this decision on the merits in this Court is to
agree that this decision should be looked at in the light
of Onofre.
MR. ARCARA:
QUESTION:

I agree, Your Honor.
Okay.

(Laughter)
MR. ARCARA:

Secondly, these types of

solicitations could also lead to a violent reaction.

And,

beyond the fact that they are forced upon an individual in
a public setting, they are so intimate in nature that I
submit that a violent reaction could be generated by a
solicitee when some one addresses his sexuality in a
public street.
I further believe regarding the compelling state
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

interest here that there is a real effect on minors.

2

There is an incident in the record — and I make this

3

claim based upon what is in the record — that a mother

4

was concerned about her son being apprehensive about going

5

out into the street being solicited to engage in an act of

6

oral sodomy.

7

I submit that there is a potential harm when the

8

sexuality of a minor is addressed in a public street, not

9

with the consent of the minor or his parent, but strictly

10

is to the arbitrariness and discretion of a pure stranger.

11

Thirdly, I submit that this law acts as a

12

deterrent to those minors who would solicit, either

13

voluntarily or through coercion.

14

prevents minors from being exploited by those who would

15

seek to satisfy their own sexual desires.

16

And, further, it

Lastly I submit that we are dealing here with a

17

public nuisance.

18

businessmen were concerned about congregating groups of

19

solicitors.

20

senior citiens and elderly people were somewhat

21

apprehensive about going into the neighborhood to

22

the stores and the to the restaurants that are located in

23

that area.

24

walking outside their homes for fear of being solicited.

25

What you have in the posture of this case here

The record clearly establishes that

They believe that there was a problem that

And, the citizens were apprehensive about

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

is that these individuals have talken over the area of

2

Genesee Street in the City of Buffalo and taking over the

3

area of North Street and Delaware and North Street and

4

Irving Place.

5

Having set out these compelling interests of the

6

state, the speech and the conduct we are here now can be

7

examined as it relates to the First Amendment.

8
9

First, in regard to the context of the
solicitation, I don't think it can be disputed that the

10

communications we are dealing with here are not ideas,

11

they are not discussions of the issues or of opinions.

12

There is no search for the truth here.

13
14

way at all a pursuit by man for his higher pursuits.
I
%
submit that at the minimum these solicitations are lewd

15

and perhaps they may be obscene.

16

four-letter, sexual explicit epithet emblazed on the

17

jacket of an individual to denote some political position.

18

These are solicitations which are wholly erotic in nature

19

and they are merely meant to satisfy the personal and the

20

selfish sexual desires of the solicitors.

21

These are in no

These are not

Much of the conversations that we are dealing

22

with here deal with the crime of prostitution and I submit

23

are clearly not protective.

24
25

We submit that certainly an argument can be
made, a strong argument I submit, that this type of speech
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

should be denied, all constitutional protection based upon

2

the content.

3

protected with respect to the content, then I submit that

4

in the context of which it is uttered clearly prohibits

5

the implication of a First Amendment.

However, if somehow this speech is minimally

We are talking about a public street here.

6
7

There is no right to privacy involved here.

8

solicitations are not occurring in one's home.

9

in a public area that belong to the citizens of their

10
11

The
These are

community.
They are delivered indiscriminately, with the

12

key here that they are delivered without any indication at

13

all on the receptiveness on the part of the solicitee.

14

As noted earlier, these solicitations involve

15

the most intimate of matters and they are made without the

16

consent of the solicitee.

17

Last and most importantly here, the solicitees'

18

rights of privacy have been infringed upon.

He is not

19

only a captive listener here, but he is forced to respond

20

even if by abrupt avoidance.

21

at that person, I would say that is much more intimidating

22

than even in Colfax or in Laramie where the conversation

23

was not directed at your personally.

24

becomes a topic of conversation with someone who may be a

25

total stranger to you.

Now, with regard to the overbreadth, Mr.

2

Uplinger claims here and suggests that the statute

3

overreaches with respect to his conduct as reflected in

4

the record.

5

QUESTION:

Well, the Court of Appeals didn't

deal with — denied it was placing its decision on

overbreadth.

MR. ARCARA:

issue, Your Honor, in their brief, so I thought that the
Court here may want to deal with that.
I would like to go back to the facts regarding

11
12

But, the Respondents raise that

the solicitation by Mr. Uplinger.
We have a Buffalo police officer who is standing

13
14

on the steps in a private or in a quiet residential area

15

of the City of Buffalo.

16

Buffalo police officer and after the initial greetings

17

then said to him, do you want to get high?

18

officer responded in the negative, no.

19

other individuals came over and they were involved in a

20

conversation when a police vehicle arrived and the police

21

officers inside asked the individuals to get off the steps

22

and to leave the area.

Mr. Uplinger approached the

The police

Then a group of

At the time the Buffalo police officer separated

23

himself from Mr. Uplinger and walked away from Mr.

Uplinger.

Mr. Uplinger then followed or pursued the

6

Mr. Uplinger.

7

The police officer responded — He said, why don't
The police officer then said I am afraid
This was the

At this point in time, and I submit in an

8

offensive way and I submit without any receptiveness on

9

the part of the police officer, Mr. Uplinger asked the

10

police officer to come over to his house to engage in an

11

act of oral sodomy.

12

I submit here that the real argument that my

13

opponent is addressing with his overbreadth question is

14

that they are saying that since these type of

15

solicitations don't both them, therefore, the public must

16

tolerate them similarly to a publicly intoxicated person

17

who would say that public intoxication doesn't bother me,

18

why should it offend you?

19

If there is one instance where there may be a

20

possible overbreadth, I submit, that is if an individual

21

were to loiter in a public place with another person and

22

that person is not a minor and he knows that the solicitee

23

is receptive.

24

could be a possible overbreadth.

25

And, that one instance, I submit, there

understand why we are talking about overbreadth in view of

2

the Court of Appeals' clear statment that it wasn't basing

3

its decision on that.

4

review their decision.

5

And, I assumed we were here to

Now, for purposes of your argument, do you

6

assume that there is a right of privacy as articulated in

7

Onofre?

8

that this statute need not be held invalid?

9
10

Do you make that assumption and nevertheless urge

MR. ARCARA:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
Well, certainly the assumption that

11

Onofre was correctly decided is contrary to our summary

12

affirmance of the Doe case in 1976 from the Eastern

13

District of Virginia, isn't it?

You were assuming somehow that Onofre

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question before you

proceed?
MR. ARCARA:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Is there any legislative history that

sheds light as to the'purpose of this statute?
MR. ARCARA:

No, Your Honor.

I do cite in my

brief the Model Penal Code that indicates what the purpose
of this statute was and that is that it was a harassment
statute.
QUESTION:

Well, was there any evidence in the

legislative history that that was its purpose?
MR. ARCARA:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, there wasn't.
In the dissenting opinion there is a

statement that every indication is that this statute was
designed to regulate public conduct which would be
considered offensive.

There is no citation or

documentation of that.
MR. ARCARA:
QUESTION:

Do you have any in mind?
No, Your Honor.

But, apparently the majority of the

New York Court of Appeals felt that it did not view the
legislative purpose to be the deterrence of harassment,
but, nonetheless, I suppose you would perhaps say that
this statute that we are looking at was an effort to
control certain public conduct rather than conduct in

it was?

under-inclusiveness, the opponent suggests that the New

solicitations or deviate sexual intercourse and not normal

2

sexual intercourse.

3

I submit that New York does prohibit

4

solicitations for normal sex under the general harassment

5

statute and that statute, however, does require an intent

6

to harass.

7

I believe that what occurred here is that the

8

legislature felt that this type of conduct was so

9

offensive to the general public that they decided to make

10

11

this a strict liability statute.
In conclusion, I ask that this Court act on

behalf of the citizens of New York and their right not

only to privacy but tranquility in their neighborhood and

2

been mentioned briefly, I want to emphasize that the state

is asking this Court to go beyond its jurisdiction.

I might also say that the state has varied its

position with regard to whether the court below construed

the statute or not.

quotation:

am quoting, "Contrary to the conclusion of the New York

11

13

In other words, in the petition for certiorari,

14

they were saying what I say which is that the Court of

15

Appeals did construe the statute.

16

When they got into the main brief, they were

17

saying somewhat the same thing as I indicate in my

responding brief, and then when they got to the reply

brief, as a result, I believe, of my having raised the

based upon, I believe, a misreading of the decision Ward

that that person could not be convicted?

Now, on what

I would say that the ground would

15

be that the Court of Appeals has construed the statute as

16

being limited to a smaller — if I may use the word

"geographical" area — than what you are talking about.

20

this particular statute at the present time.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. GARDNER:

On either count.

However, the New

23

24

conduct could be subject to conviction.

I cite the Phipps versus Ohio case as an example

of those acts under either of those counts is covered by

say this is a constitutionally-based decision.

All you are saying is

pattern of an individual who extended a private invitation

2

to go to his home and engage in —

3

QUESTION:

It may be private, but can you

4

imagine holding that when he solicited an undercover

police officer that it was sort of a consensual matter?
MR. GARDNER:

6

I don't think that the

7

determination of the consensual matter can be judged on

8

the identity of the police officer which was not known to

9

the Respondent at that time.

10

It has to be gaged in terms

of the kind of the role the police officer was playing.

QUESTION:

Well, if it is necessary, the Court

of Appeals didn't think it was.

4

MR. GARDNER:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

I understand.

That is not the state's case.

The

state says it can't be done in public.
MR. GARDNER:

The state makes the claim, Your

8

Honor, that it can't be done in public under any

9

circumstances except in what it says is a limited

10

circumstance, if two people were in a remote place and no

11

one else was around, which, I submit, is the general

12

situation, in these kinds of situations, as pointed out in

13

the UCLA Law Review Article cited in a couple of the

14

amicus briefs.

15

I think that the problem that we are facing here

16

has to do with the kind of characterization that the state

17

gives the Court, the thought that homosexuals have taken

18

over this particular area or what-have-you.

19

if two homosexuals had met — First of all, that is not

20

true, but be that as it may, if two homosexuals had met

21

each other and had a private conversation in that

22

particular area with no one around who could hear

23

anything, under the state's analysis, the problem they are

24

facing is that he sees it that they have taken over.

25

QUESTION:

The fact is

How would that case ever come up if
29

2

MR. GARDNER:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

It would only come up —

You are talking about a hyothetical

that can't occur.
MR. GARDNER:

It would only come up in the way

6

that this case has come up, through an undercover police

7

officer, which is another way of indicating that the only

8

way that you have offensiveness in the typical situation

9

is where somebody has blatantly posed the question right

10

up front at the very beginning and has not, through a

11

process of acquaintanceship, become attuned to the fact

12

that the other person is receptive to the conversation

13

that is going to occur.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Gardner —

15

MR. GARDNER:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

— do you agree with me on my

17

understanding of the New York Court of Appeals opinion

18

which I am about to state to you that — They say in

19

Onofre we held that you cannot criminalize the act of

20

deviate sexual intercourse and that is their language.

21

The statute under consideration in Uplinger

22

prohibits solicitation of that sort of intercourse.

23

you can't criminalize the act, the state can't prohibit

24

the solicitation either.

25

MR. GARDNER:

Since

I am not sure that they said this
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.t N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

prohibits the solicitation.

2

QUESTION:

That is a quote.

3

QUESTION:

It is pretty close to a quote, not

4

quite.

5

MR. GARDNER:

All right.

I was only going to

6

draw the point that it is a loitering statute.

7

recall that they claimed that it was a solicitation

8

statute.

I didn't

9

But, what is clear is that it is an inchoate

10

invitation to engage in an act of conduct in a private

11

place which was not illegal.

12

And, the question I think they were facing is —

13

QUESTION:

It is not illegal only in the sense

14

that the New York Court of Appeals has opined that the

15

legislature can't make it illegal in Onofre.

16

MR. GARDNER:

I pointed out in my brief, Your

17

Honor, that it is not illegal after the Onofre decision,

18

as a matter of adjudication in that case, whatever the

19

rule may be in this Court's opinion with regard to the

20

correctness of that case.

21

reach that issue.

22

QUESTION:

I don't believe you need to

Well, I don't know that I agree with

23

you, because if one of the pins of the New York Court of

24

Appeals opinion in this case is the validity of its Onofre

25

decision — We obviously can't review Onofre, but we can
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

certainly review the constitutional law that is laid down

2

in Onofre.

3

MR. GARDNER:

I would agree that you have that

4

power.

5

to do it under the circumstances that you are presented

6

with in this case.

7

What I would say is that it may not be appropriate

I have referred to the Gates decision in my

8

brief and I submit that that should be reviewed and

9

thought about.

The one thing that I would emphasize,

10

please, is that we do not have a record here that would

11

give Your Honor and the Court sufficient information to

12

make the kind of judgments and evaluations as to whether

13

the Onofre decision was correct in terms of the social

14

impact, in terms of the degree of participation in the

15

kinds of sexual activities that we are talking about,

16

things of that sort.

/

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Gardner, assuming that that

18

is correct and we shouldn't address the correctness of the

19

Onofre decision, nevertheless, if there is any right, as

20

recognized in Onofre, and assuming for this purpose that

21

there is, does that right extent to prohibiting the state

22

from controlling attempts made in public?

23

the right to privacy to do things in private extend on to

24

do the same or some portion of those things in public?

25

That is my question.

And, why should

Your Honor, I don't believe that

2

the right of sexual privacy that Onofre talked about is

3

the right that protects my client in terms of his

4

5

believe that the right we are dealing with here falls

6

under the rubric of the First Amendment freedom of speech

7

subject to all the power of regulation that is appropriate

8

under that particular Amendment.

I

9

There has been suggestions in some of the amicus

10

briefs that the right of sexual privacy may be impaired or

11

burdened in some way if the Court does not allow some very

12

limited controlled public conversation about the private

13

right.

14

I would suggest to you that if you limit it, if

15

you balance the interest as between the right of the

16

speaker to speak and the right of the hearer to have an

17

acceptable environment, as Justice Stevens indicated in

18

the Bolger case last year. If you balance those interests

19

in the area of sex, it is going to be obvious that any

20

exercise of the right of free speech is going to have to

21

be subject to consideration for the acceptability of the

22

that speech to the person you are speaking to,

23

consideration for the sensitivity of the public at large.

24
25

I would only point out to you that what the
state wants to say is that you can't talk about it at all,

solicited on the street?
MR. GARDNER:

No, Your Honor.

In Commonwealth

18

versus Sefranka — I refer you to that case —and in the

19

Pryor decision, what the Court said was that you could not

20

be convicted unless there was some reason to believe or

21

some indication that there was someone present who would

22

be offended thereby.

23

25

QUESTION:

The person who is solicited is the

one who is most offended.
MR. GARDNER:

But, let me pose these facts, if I

discussion for 30 minutes, 45 minutes, whatever, and it

3

quickly becomes apparent that we are both homosexuals and

4

that he is interested and, therefore, I extend an

5

invitation.

Suppose I meet an individual and we have a

How can there be offense?

QUESTION:

That may be fine, but I am talking

7

about the person who turns him down and he is very annoyed

8

by it.

9

other person?

10

11

Can the man then be convicted for annoying this

MR. GARDNER:

He can if there was an element

harassment or if there was an element of recklessness.

12

QUESTION:

Well, an element of harassment — He

13

says I am harassed, I don't like to be walking down the

14

street and be accosted by a homosexual.

15
16

MR. GARDNER:

The word "accosted" and the

word —

17

QUESTION:

Well, solicitated by a homosexual.

18

MR. GARDNER:

19

QUESTION:

If there is —

He came up to me very politely, very

20

politely and said, would you like to come over to my

21

house?

22

that.

23

Now, I take it you say the state may not forbid

MR. GARDNER:

I say that the state may not pass

24

a law which blanketly forbids it in all circumstances

25

without regard to —

said?

3
4

Well, may it forbid exactly what I

MR. GARDNER:

Yes, it may, if it is a narrowly

drawn statute.

5

QUESTION:

So, the state could say it is illegal

6

to solicit anybody — You have committed a criminal act if

7

you have solicited somebody who turns you down?

8

MR. GARDNER:

9

QUESTION:

10

No, no, no.

I am sorry.

Or who turns you down and is annoyed.

MR. GARDNER:

No, it is not the result of the

11

individual.

12

if, under the circumstances, you had no reason to believe

13

that they would be consensual towards that kind of a

14

solicitation in terms of receiving the information.

15
16

It is illegal for you to solicit somebody,

QUESTION:

So, if a fellow comes up and says let

me ask you a few questions, is he off the hook then?

17

MR. GARDNER:

I think it is a factual question

18

in every case, Your Honor.

19

the real issue here is whether or not you can blanketly

20

proscribe speech without requiring that there be some —

21

22
23

We can pose hypotheticals, but

MR. GARDNER:

It is a state overbreadth

argument?
It may be.

I would

24

point out in that connection, someone asked the District

25

Attorney what he was doing, whether he was just responding

1

to our arguments in that regard.

2

at the brief, you will see that the District Attorney, and

3

I don't fault him for this, has argued association,

4

overbreadth, underinclusiveness and vagueness in his

5

original brief to the Court.

6

issues were submitted to the court below and it is

7

difficult to determine whether they had an impact on the

8

decision below or whether they would be before this —

9
10

QUESTION:

If Your Honors will look

On the basis that those

Well, an overbreadth argument

certainly didn't have much of an impact.

11

QUESTION:

That is the only one that you can say

12

that might not have had an impact, I think, because the

13

only constitutional doctrine which the Court of Appeals

14

mentions is one which it says it didn't use.

15

QUESTION:

18

MR. GARDNER:

17

Either implicitly or overtly.
I think that the argument I

make —

18

QUESTION:

Although the dissent said that they

19

were really, in effect, applying overbreadth and the

20

majority the dissent couldn't be more misguided.

21

MR. GARDNER:

We have to go back one step, If I

22

may.

23

Court was doing. I submit to you that what the Court below

24

was doing was saying that the ultimate act had been

25

converted into a legal constitutionally protected act and

We have to go back to determine what it was the

38

that, therefore, you couldn't forbid discussion about that

2

act.
Now, what we do not know is whether their

statement to that effect is a First Amendment speech

statement or whether it is an extension of the privacy

concept.

But,the Court of Appeals didn't say

It said antecedent —

QUESTION:

Yes.

It certainly didn't use the

11

term discussion which might have lent some support to the

12

idea that it was a First Amendment.

13

MR. GARDNER:

The whole case was about

solicitation.

15

actual solicitation.

16

Appeals meant or whether they were thinking in First

17

Amendment terms because they didn't express it.

you can't punish the discreet invitation for that act.

The Court of Appeals was dealing with an

22

Can the state ban a prostitute of either sex from

soliciting intercourse in public or soliciting money for

25

MR. GARDNER:

Yes, I believe they can.

11

QUESTION:

Well, the statute does exactly that

12

as I understand it.

That is precisely what this statute

13

does and you have two Respondents here, one of which

14

apparently was involved in a heterosexual solicitation and

15

that is precisely what this statute does.

16

MR. GARDNER:

That gets into the area of the

17

discrimination argument, Your Honor.

18

you look at the trial court memorandum and opinion, it

19

says that they only started going after the prostitutes

20

after Onofre was decided.

21

We started out — if

Although the statute is broadly written and

22

could theoretically apply to any heterosexual sex, it is

23

not applied to anyone else at all.

QUESTION:

What difference does it make what the

motivations were or what triggered the Constitution

What has that got to do with the constitutional

Well, it has to do with the

underinclusiveness and denial of equal protection argument

which I made in my brief.

with Justice Rehnquist inquiry, my response is the same.

7

The state could prohibit public solicitation in a singles

bar or elsewhere in heterosexual situations.

9

the commercial aspect.

10

But, on this particular point,

Put aside

I think that is a different

question.

11

If you had a situation either where the

12

individual was coming up announced blantantly to somebody

13

and issuing an invitation in what would have to be a

14

harassing situation under the facts, but I don't think

15

that they could extend it to the point of two

10

acquaintances, for example, who happen to be sitting in a

17

bar and one invited the other to go home for consensual

sex.

Again, you get to the point that there must be

2

some type, when you're not dealing with ultimate

3

criminal conduct, you get to seme point where there has

to be seme type of freedom cf speech and the narrowing

of the writing of statute which is going to restrict

miners and things of that sort, there are other

statut es.

14

you're looking for some of those other types of

What the Court cf Appeals said was this

15

statute doesn't deal with that, this statute is part of

16

the statutary scheme which was involved in the

17

consensual sodomy law, and the legislature cf the State

18

of New York is free to deal with those other problems

19

any time they want to, as long as they write, to the

20

extent that it imposes free speech restrictions,

21

narrowly, narrowly stated statutes that do not unduly

22

impinge upon free communication.

23

QUESTION;

Mr. Gardner,

in that connection, I

24

thought I understood you to say at the cutset cf ycur

25

argument that the constitutional issue was here, and now

MR. GARDNER:

Appeals, which --

Justice Powell, L think that

what has happened -QUESTION:

-- would not leave us free,

perhaps, to consider any other question.
MR. GARDNER:

Justice Powell, what I’m saying

is that the Court of Appeals has defined the scope of
the statute.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GARDNER:

Yes.
And they’ve limited that..

Then

12

they have declared

that statute as so defined

13

unconstitutional.

The issue as to whether it is

14

constitutional as construed is before this Court.

15

the Court is bound by the construction, which does not

16

encompass all of these ether concerns with regard to

17

harassment, offensiveness, children, and things of those

18

other types of things that would be very critical in the

1

correct case and involving the correct statute.

20

Eut

In the brief that the State filed there is a

21

considerable amount of, I wculd call, slipperiness as to

22

whether we're dealing with speech or conduct.

23

we’re dealing with a question of whether vagueness has

24

been violated, the State tends to refer to the fact that

25

there can only be an arrest of there's actual speech,

That was a statute that dealt with the

15

question of a threat and of conduct that tended toward

16

intimidation, and the court specifically talked in terms

17

of the fact that the ultimate act could generally only

18

be committed by some type of communication and therefore

19

it tended toward pure speech.

20

with the issues under the First Amendment, dealing with

21

the problem of cverbreadth being thrown up as an

22

argument against the appellant, the court stated

23

first,

24

about cverbreadth; and even if we did, there is

substantial overbreadth here.

And therefore, dealing

1

I would submit to the Court that there is

2

substantial overbreadth here as well because, although

3

we have specifically here facts in this case regarding

4

solicitation on North Street in Buffalo, what the State

is arguing for is a general power to forbid any type of

sexual invitation to come home, even in a gay bar, which

13

I’m anticipating that either my opponent or someone cn
