husband complained, that they were both libeled by an

Washington, Culco against Superior Court of California,

7

and Worldwide Volkswagen against Woodson, along with the

individuals, and it commented that really all that they

would add to the California suit would he an opportunity

12

for the plaintiff to try to collect additional punitive

damage from them personally.

materials were available in Florida, press clippings,

2

what other information there was.

3

So the question in this case is whether there

4

is jurisdiction not just over the corporate publisher,

5

hut over the two Florida employees who never even

6

entered Florida in connection with this story.

QUESTION*

3

over the publisher?

4

MB. KESTEBs

5

QUESTIONS

You haven’t contested jurisdiction

That’s correct.
I gather one of your arguments, Mr.

6

Kester, is that the fact cf the publisher’s submission

7

to jurisdiction ouqht bear on whether or not there is

8

constitutional jurisdiction over the individuals?

9

MB. KESTERi

We think it should, because it

10

makes a great practical difference in this case, and as

11

I understand it, the standard jurisdictional analysis

12

that this Court makes when personal jurisdiction of a

13

state court is challenged, and the analysis that the

14

state courts themselves make, is, first of all, whether

15

the particular defendant had sufficient minimum contacts

16

with the state to make jurisdiction not unreasonable,

17

and then the second step is, as the International Shoe

18

case said, cnce there are other contacts, you than lcck

19

at their nature and quality, and see whether in ail the

20

circumstances it is reasonable in that situation for

21

that state court to exercise jurisdiction.

22

QUESTION!

And one of those against it, you

23

suggest, is that the publisher has consented to

24

jurisdiction, or submitted, rather?

25

ME. KESTEB s

Yes, because what we say, ' r.

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Justice Brennan, is that essentially what is practically

2

at stake in here, as was recognized by the Superior

3

Court of Los Angeles County, is simply whether these two

4

individuals can be held personally liable for additional

5

punitive damages beyond what the plaintiff might be able

6

to recover against the publisher.

7

as to the solvency of the publisher here to pay a

8

judgment.

9

provides an opportunity to — a libel action provides an

10

opportunity to vindicate reputation, the plaintiff can

11

fully vindicate her reputation in the suit against the

12

National Enquirer if she is able to, if she is

13

suecessful.

14

QUESTION s

Hell, but that isn’t really the

15

whole story, is it, Hr. Kester?

16

my day, it was thought to be advantageous if you were

17

suing the railroad company for a crossing accident, you

18

not only sued the railroad company, you joined the

19

conductor and the engineer, and dismissed them at the

20

close of the plaintiff’s case, because you were able to

21

deal with them much differently, in depositions and in

22

handling them on the witness stand as adverse witnesses

23

if they were named parties.

24

doing that for was to get a judgment against the

25

corporate defendant.

Certainly, at least in

MR. TESTER*

There is nc question in my mind,

2

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the plaintiff brought the

3

suit in Los Angeles County because she thought that was

4

the best forum for her to bring a suit in , and she may

5

very well have concluded that there were advantages to

6

her in naming a whole string of defendants and net just

7

the real tort feasor if a tort occurred here, because in

8

libel

there was made by the publisher.

the tort is publication, and the only publication

10

QUESTION:

Well, if the defendant is the only

11

tort feasor, presumably the plaintiff’s complaint would

12

ultimately be dismissed for failure to state a claim for

13

relief.

14

two individuals are also tort feasors.

15

I think the plaintiff’s hypothesis is that the

MB. KESTEF«

They could be proved

to be tert

16

feasors, or they might not, but Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

17

the initial question here is not liability.

18

talking about jurisdiction.

19

any question the mind of any member of the bar or any

20

judge that merely having to defend the lawsuit is a

21

substantial burden.

22

Constitution didn’t recognize that, we wouldn’t have all

these cases under the Fourteenth Amendment saying due

country into a foreign court where there are

But of course there is an obverse

side to that here, too.

off to Florida and have to sue in Florida.

MB. KESTEF;

If you prevail and the

That is right.
And she was liable in California,

where she lives.
MR. KESTEBi

That is the dilemma which the

11

courts face in any jurisdiction case where the plaintiff

12

wants tc be in one court and the defendants want to be

13

in another, and what we are sayinc, Mr. Justice

14

Rehnquist, is that we think that the collective

15

defendants in this case have gone pretty far already.

16

The National Enquirer has said, you want to sue us in

17

Los Angeles County.

18

We will defend ourselves there.

19

QUESTIONi

All right.

Bare we are.

Cue us.

Well, hew much of a concession was

20

that on the part of the National Enquirer?

21

circulates hundreds of thousands of papers in

22

California.

23

of the arguments that sere available mc the defendant in

The plaintiff lived there.

Hellr T think that —
I mean, I thought perhaps it could

MR. KESTER:

It couldn't have gotten off the

I would say, sir, that the

National Enquirer is not incapable of graciousness on
occasion.

11

(General laughter.)

12

MR. KESTERs

I really don't think that that is

13

central to the case anyway.

14

appeared that there was a very strong winning argument

15

that that court had no jurisdiction over the National

16

Enquirer, its attorneys might well have urged, them to

17

make that argument.

18

anything really at stake here for the plaintiff against

QUESTION:

But shouldn't punitive damages have

been recovered in Florida for the damage in California?
MR. KESTER:

Punitive damages probably could

1

be recovered in Florida.

2

QUESTION*

So the harm inflicted «as something

3

the plaintiffs could sue for and recover from these two

4

people.

5

It's just a question of where?
ME. HESTER:

Well, it’s a little more than

6

just the question of where, hr. Justice White, because

7

had the suit been brought against them personally in

8

Florida, one thing they would have had would be the

9

advantage of a different standard in Florida law as to

10

what must be shown to collect punitive damages than is

11

the case in California.

12

13

QUESTION*

Do you think that Florida would

apply its own punitive damages —

I surely would urge them

18

QUESTION*

19

I know you would urge them, but —

Of course you would, unless they

would give mere punitive damages than California.
HP. KESTERs

20

I would say that the chance of

21

getting Florida to apply its own law in this case would

22

bo pretty good, because Florida just two years age

Well, in any event, the major

She could fi’e a complaint in

Florida that would state a cause of action in Florida.

8

Yes, sir.

9

important to these two individuals, obviously.

But where they are sued is extremely

lew, the ccnsititutiona1 provisions that bear

10
11

on this, as I said earlier, are three, the due process

12

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the- commerce clause,

13

and because these are corporate employees of a

14

publisher, the First Amendment applies: as well.

QUESTION*

Well, you recall his emphasis on

the word "press" in the First Amendment.
MR. XESTERs

Oh, yes, hut when we say the

4

First Amendment is at stake here to some degree, we are

5

not asking really for any special favor for the press,

6

and we are not saying that the institutional press has

7

some rights that other people don’t have.

8

that at all.

9

It is not

Shat we are saying here is simply that this

10

Court at least since International Shoe and going

11

through Culco against California, many other cases —

policy is something we look at.

14

are found, we weigh it all, we look at the policy, and

15

we have got that scale of justice there with the two

16

pans going up and down, and one of the little brass

weights that you put on one side is what is this going

to do to the First Amendment, to the system of free

trade and ideas, as this Court said in the Red Lien —

whether the issue might be published there.

probability that that will occur, I se-e no reason why

7

I would think so, Your Honor, and

8

T think that is directed in the Church of Scientology

case.

That is that one can reasonably anticipate more

10

injury in the state of residence.

11

to be a state where one's reputation resides, it would

12

certainly be primarily or at least predominantly within

13

the state of residency, and because of California being

14

the state of residency, one could also anticipate that

15

the interest of the readership will be largest in the

18

community in which the plaintiff happens to reside.

very shaky both precedential and logical roots, and in

QUESTION*

As a matter of substantive law, and

6

I suppose this would depend on the law of California,

7

ordinarily an agent is not insulated from personal

8

liability because the principal is liable for his

9

conduct also.

10

Isn’t that correct?

HR. fiBIOSs

That’s correct as a matter cf

11

substantive liability, and here we are not — we may not

12

be talking in terms of agency, because cf the element of

13

punitive damages which may be interjected.

14

law would be that if in fact Hr. South or Hr. Calder

16

engaged in wrongful conduct not authorised by the

16

Enquirer, it is conceivable that agency principle might

17

not apply, but certainly then the intentional wilful

18

wrongdoing of those individuals would equally subject

19

them to substantive liability.

That is, the

3

We feel that the standard jurisdictional analysis should

4

be applied, and when that application is made in the

5

facts of this — in this case, jurisdiction over both

6

Sr. Calder and Sr. South is clear.

7

The cases for which — which are cited in

8

support of the due process restriction on subjecting

9

employees to jurisdiction for acts they committed in the

10

coarse of their corporate employment we feel are largely

11

inapposite.

12

where there is an effort to impute jurisdiction by the

13

corporation — I am sorry, impute jurisdiction from the

14

corporation- to the employee where the employee cannot be

15

shown to have in fact had the contact himself, even if

16

it was as an agent cf the corporation with the

17

jurisdiction, and under these circumstances, we have no

18

problem with at least suggesting that in fact there may

19

be a more serious due process problem.

20

They generally deal with the situation

Where, however, the jurisdiction is premised

the wrongful conduct is made out clearly by the facts,

understanding that a publication and its primary

here an article which on its face is at least horrendous

and possibly worse.

It is a very simple matter for plaintiff to allege, as
