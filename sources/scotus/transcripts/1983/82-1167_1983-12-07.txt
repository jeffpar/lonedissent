CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Strauss, I think

you may proceed, when you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEE

MR. STRAUSS;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;
The issue in this case is whether law
enforcement officers must obtain a search warrant before

10

they conduct a chemical analysis of a substance that is

11

lawfully in their possession to determine whether it is

12

an illegal or controlled drug.

13

The facts of this case are typical of

14

narcotics prosecutions.

15

Federal Express, which is a private freight carrier,

16

opened a cardboard package addressed to Respondents that

17

had been given to Federal Express for shipment.

18

the package was a tube wrapped in gray tape.

19

Federal Express employees cut open the tube and removed

20

from inside of it a transparent container that consisted

21

of four plastic bags, one inside the other.

22

innermost plastic bag was a white powder.

23

In May 1981 the employees cf

Inside

The

Inside the

It is undisputed that the Federal Express

24

employees undertook all these actions on their own

25

without any governmental involvement whatever.

The Federal Express employees suspected that
the white powder might he an illegal drug and —
QUESTIONS

Nell, they didn't — they didn't

open the plastic bag.
MR. STRAUSS:

They did not open the plastic

bag, that's right.
QUESTION:

Would the existence of the bag in

8

that condition amount to, in your view, immediately

9

apparent incriminating material to authorize a plain

10
11
12

view seizure?
MR. STRAUSS:

that at that point probable cause existed.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. STRAUSS:

15
16
17
18

I think it's absolutely clear

Why?
That's right.

Because it was a

white powder packaged —
QUESTION:

Any white powder package like that,

there's probable cause to believe that it's contraband?
MR. STRAUSS:

Yes.

I don't think people send

19

baking soda or sugar or talcum powder through Federal

20

Express wrapped in four plastic bags like that; or at

21

least the probability cf their doing sc is small enough

22

so this constitutes probable cause.

23

didn't constitute probable cause, then you're in the

24

paradoxical situation — it's one of the oddities cf the

25

court of appeals opinion — that the court apparently

In fact, if this

1

thought that law enforcement officers were in the

2

position that they couldn't do anything.

3

simply have had to allow this shipment to go through.

4

They couldn't seize it, they couldn't test it.

5

According to the court of appeals, they would simply

6

have had to walk away at this point.
QUESTION*

7

They would

Do you think the knowledge they had

8

acquired at that time before the testing,

just the

9

observation, would have been sufficient to support the

10

issuance of a warrant to search the house after they

11

made the controlled delivery?
HR. STRAUSSs

12

13

Yes, I think that's riqht,

because there existed probable cause to -QUESTIONS

14

I was asking the question.

15

— would it support the warrant?

16

HR. STRAUSS:

17

QUESTIONS

18

MR. STRAUSSs

Is it

Yes.

And you think it would.
In my view it would, yes,

19

because it would establish probable cause to believe

20

that that was contraband, probably cocaine, and after

21

delivery there would be probable cause to believe it was

22

cocain e.

23

QUESTION;

Is that -- there must be a lot of

24

cases then supporting your view that any time you see a

25

white powder in plastic bags, you have probable cause tc

believe it*s contraband.

2

that?

3

MR. STRAUSSs

4

QUESTION s

Are there a lot of cases like

Well, actually not just --

Does anybody ever get a warrant

5

when they see white powder in a plastic bag, or do they

6

just automatically open up the bag?
NR. STRAUSSi

7
8

that's right.

Well, they conduct a field test,

And every other court that has looked at

this situation has not had any difficulty with their
10

conducting a field test, and the field test, of course —
QUESTIONi

11

Well, the field test is one thing,

12

but getting in the bag — getting in the bag is

13

another.

14

different if. the bag had been not transparent but

15

opaque.

16

information, reliable private information that there was

17

cocaine in that bag; namely, you had probable cause to

18

believe there was cocaine in the bag, which is no

1

different than the kind of probable cause you say

20

existed here where it was transparent.

I take it your position wouldn't be any

And yet you had — suppose you had had private

21

MR. STRAUSSs

22

QUESTIONs

23
24
25

No.

I think —

Could you then — could you then

open the bag?
MR. STRAUSSs

I think it would make a

difference if the bag were opaque.

1

QUESTION;

Why?

2

MR. STRAUSS;

Why?

Because the Court said in

3

Arkansas against Sanders that certain containers don’t

4

support a reasonable expectation of privacy because

5

their contents is immediately —

6

QUESTION;

Well, yeah, but what if you had

7

probable cause to believe there was cocaine in that

8

opaque bag?

9

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, at least certain opaque

10

containers.

11

something like that, probable cause, of course, is not —

12

If, say, it were an attache case or

QUESTION;

Well, what about an opaque plastic

13

bag, and you had probable cause to believe there was

14

cocaine in it.

15

Could you tear it open and field test it?

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, the question would be

16

whether under what the Court said in Arkansas against

17

Sanders that container supported a reasonable

18

expectation of privacy.

19

Now, an opaque plastic bag I think would be a

20

borderline case.

A transparent plastic bag is not a

21

borderline case.

A transparent plastic bag is the test

22

example of a container that, to quote the Court's words

23

in Arkansas against Sanders, "containers that by their

24

very nature cannot support a reasonable expectation of

25

privacy because their contents can be inferred from
7

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

their outward appearance."
There is no inference going on here.

2

The

3

contents were immediately apparent from the outside —

4

from the outward appearance because the container was

5

transp arent.
QUESTION:

6

Well,

that is — it's just not the

7

contents, but it’s the fact they're wrapped up in a

8

plastic bag and shipped by Federal Express.
MB. STRAUSS:

9

That's right.

But there's no

10

question at all those things were lawfully apparent to

11

the DEA agents when they arrived.
QUESTION:

12

Ycu wouldn't say that if you have a

13

search warrant for an apartment to hunt for some object

14

and you run into a white powder sitting around in a

15

glass somewhere that that's immediately seizable as

16

cocaine, would you?

17

MR. STRAUSS:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. STRAUSS:

20

Oh, no, certainly not.

It may be somebody's ashes.
I think those containers are

ordinarily opaque.

21

QUESTION:

An urn.

22

MR. STRAUSS:

In fact, the Court went on to

23

say in

Arkansas against Sanders, "Similarly, in some

24

cases the contents of a package will be open to plain

25

view, thus obviating the need for a warrant."

8

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Now, the contents of this package were open to

1
2

plain

view, and that obviated the need for us to obtain

3

a warrant to open the transparent container.
QUESTION <

4
5

So you think the plain view

exception just covers this case and that's the end of it.
MR. STRAUSSs

6

Well, the plain view exception

7

authorized the — authorized the agents to take a few

8

grains of cocaine.

grains .

11

MR. STRAUSSs

12

and take a few grains.
QUESTIONS

13
14
15

That's right.

To open the tag

That still leaves a question of the

test.
MR. STRAUSSs

That's right.

That leaves the

i

16

question of the test.

17

principal issue in the case.

18

And

that, in our view, is the

Now, before I get to the merits of the test,

19

would like to say a word about why we considered this

20

issue to be of considerable importance.

21

The chemical analyses of substances suspected

22

of being narcotics are absolutely routine in narcotics

23

prosecutions.

24

hundreds, if not thousands, of cases a year.

25

hold that every time a chemical analysis is undertaken

They are undertaken in virtually

1

of a substance that the — the possessor of which has

2

not consented to the analysis in some way, that every

3

time that occurs, a warrant must be obtained.
QUESTIONS

4

But you -- you — you agree before

5

the test should be administered that you at least ought

6

to have probable cause to believe that it’s contraband

7

or not.
MR. STRAUSSs

8
9
10

No, we don't need probable --

it's not a search within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendm ent.
QUESTION;

11

So — so in my example when you're

12

searching the apartment for a stolen piano, you see cn

13

the — you see on a shelf a white powder in a glass, you

14

can just take a pinch cf it and test it, even though you

15

have no reason to believe whatsoever that it's

16

contraband.
MR. STRAUSSs

17
18

position. Justice White.

I -- that -- that is our
I think that is the right view.

Now, let me say as I say that that — that we

19
20

don't think and we're not asking the Court to say that

21

there is no circumstance at all —
QUESTION;

22

Well, you are, though.

You are,

23

though.

You're saying that it's not a search at all

24

subject to the Fourth Amendment to field test any white

25

powder that you find anywhere.

KB. STRAUSS;

1

Well, that — that is, we are

2

not asking the Court to go so far as to say there

3

couldn't be some circumstance in which someone could

4

make it clear that they attach unusual privacy values to

5

a substance.

6

good example.

Maybe Justice Rehnquist’s example is a
If it were clear that this was a —

QUESTION;

8

ME. STRAUSS;

9

An ashes urn?
An ashes urn, something which

had unusual privacy attributes, we’re not asking the

10

Court to say that some such extraordinary case might not

11

come along in which we would be required to have some

12

quantum of suspicion.

13

case.

14

this in a transparent container shipped like this had

15

the privacy attributes associated with someone's ashes

16

in an urn.

17

But this is clearly not that

No one suggested that a white powder package like

And —
QUESTION;

Of course, you don't need to go

18

that far in this case because you claim you had probable

19

cause to believe that it was cocaine or was a drug.

20

MR. STRAUSS;

21

QUESTION;

22

23
24
25

Yes, yes.

I — well, I --

And at least in these cases you

think you ought to be able to field test.
MR. STRAUSS;

Oh, yes, certainly, a fortiori,

if we have probable cause.
QUESTION;

But how -- how much difference does
11

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

— do the two alternate methods of analysis make,

2

because your position is that every time you see white

3

powder wrapped in several sacks in transit, you have

4

probable cause to believe that it's contraband.

5

there really isn't any independent determination or

6

additional factual determination that you make once you

7

have those facts before you.

8
9

ME. STRAUSS*

So that

Well, in this case and in a case

similar to it we will have probable cause.

There may be

many instances in which we would have suspicion not

We might come across a

we get a case like that.
ME. STRAUSS*

Well, there is — there was

17

undoubtedly probable cause in this case.

And if the

18

Court’s view is that we need probable cause to conduct

19

this test, we are entitled to win this case.

20

But there are instances in which substances —

21

where you have only reasonable suspicion to believe that

22

a substance is contraband, and to require warrants in

those cases would, we think, net serve — or to require

probable cause in those cases would, we think, not serve

QUESTION;

1

Sr. Strauss, may I ask a question

2

about the record?

3

in the record, and if so, where, in the materials before

4

us?
MR. STRAUSS;

5
6

Does the warrant application appear

It’s in the record.

It's not in

the — it’s not in the Joint Appendix.
QUESTION;

7

Am I correct in assuming, because

a

otherwise I have difficulty understanding the court of

9

appeals, that the warrant application did not spell out

10

the elements of probable cause other than the results of

11

the field test?
MR. STRAUSS;

12

Not quite, Justice Stevens.

It

13

did not — it did not supply all of the details of the

14

packag e.

15

QUESTION;

So it's conceivable that the

16

warrant application would not have been sufficient

17

without including the — it’s conceivable.

18

asking you to make an admission on that.

19

MR. STRAUSS;

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. STRAUSS;

22

23

I*m not

It is conceivable.

Yes.
It is no more than that.

$e

don’t think that's right.
QUESTION;

Because if you had ample probable

24

cause apart from the field test, I imagine you could

25

protect yourself by filling out a warrant application
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62S4300

1

that did not rely on the field test.
MB. STBAUSS:

2

Oh, yes.

I mean we — we

3

presumably could have obtained a warrant to search the

4

house without the field test, and then the search of the

5

house —
QUESTIONS

6

And in that circumstance the field

7

test really would just have served to protect the -- the

8

owner of the powder from the risk, that you were making a

9

m i s ta k e .
MR. STBAUSS*

10

That’s exactly right.

And that

11

is often the function that these field tests serve.

12

mean very often that is true.

13

investigation could go forward quite properly without

14

the field test, and it is better —

15

QUESTION*

16

MR. STRAUSS;

17

Very often the

But often it couldn’t.
Sometimes it couldn’t.

Sometimes —
QUESTION*

18
19

I

If there was just reasonable

suspic ion.
MR. STRA.USS*

20

Sometimes the next action the

21

officers would take would require more than reasonable

22

suspicion.

23

officers could have gone forward without it and search

24

the house.

25

But very often, as in this case, the

9

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, they are undoubtedly

10

different, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

sight of white sugar in a sugar bowl would not authorize

12

an arrest of the persons in possession of the sugar

bowl, because they wouldn’t have probable cause to

believe it was cocaine.

MR, STRAUSS*

1

No.

Our argument is not that

2

the warrant authorized the search of the sugar bowl.

3

Our argument is that the testing of a few grains of

4

sugar is not a search, because no reasonable person

5

would think, that his privacy had been additionally

invaded by that action.

beginning.

After all, what will they

They will discover that what was in the sugar

They simply haven’t invaded that person's

privacy by learning that he keeps sugar in his sugar

QUESTION*

12

Well,

this -- this problem is —

13

becomes complicated because when it's discovered that

14

it’s just sugar, the householder doesn’t complain; it's

15

only when they discover that it’s marijuana or herein

16

that the complaint begins.

That’s exactly right, Mr. Chief

that consequences be visited on these people on the

agents came across the information — the viewing of the

12

it to them or wanted to show it to them, but simply

14

because the private person happened also to have done it.
Where you have a case in which the private

reveals it I think is immaterial.
In Burdeau against McDowell, which is, of

19

course, the fountainhead of the private search doctrine,

21

the private party sent some documents to the

in a way that the contents of every document was

available — was immediately apparent on plain view at a

truly minimal intrusion a chemical analysis is is to use

And in this case, for example, if Respondents
had not been implicated in a shipment of cocaine, a

10

chemical analysis of that substance that the DEA agents

11

-- the Federal Express people and the DEA agents found,

12

might have revealed that the white powder wasn't sugar,

which is what it first appeared to be, but was actually

baking soda or talcum powder.

Now, it's just not the kind of invasion cf

And there is

Now, as I understand Respondents’ position,

21

they don’t squarely join issue with us on the question

22

of whether the chemical analysis was a search within the

23

meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and they instead seem

24

to think that it was the steps leading up to the

25

chemical analysis — the opening of the plastic bag and

Is it established it takes just a

MR. STRAUSS:

5

Yes.

There was testimony to

that effect. Justice Blackmun.

Less than a gram and a

7

trace amount I believe were the descriptions the agent

8

used.
As I said before, this was the opening of a

10

transparent container which is the quintessential

11

example of a container that can't support an expectation

12

of privacy.

13

against Sanders was a gun case, but however much a gun

14

case reveals from the outside about its contents, a

15

transparent container reveals much more.

then,

The example the Court used in Arkansas

And if a gun

a fortiori, a transparent container cannot.
And the next thing they did was to extract a

few grains.

In our view this was simply de minimis, and

20

therefore, not within the Fourth Amendment.

21

wasn't de minimis, there is no possible sense in which

22

it was a search.

23

And the Court has said many times, twice last term

probable cause without a warrant.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK W. PETERSON, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PETERSON;

8
9

Thank, you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;
I must confess that the Government and the

10
11

Respondents view the issue in this case as being totally

12

different.

13

case is not whether police officers are required tc get

14

a search warrant every time they want to submit a

15

suspected contraband substance to testing; and rather,

16

the only issue which is involved in this case is whether

17

police officers who lawfully come into possession of a

18

— of an item which was subjected to a prior private

19

search may extend the scope of that search without

20

obtaining a search warrant, assuming that no exception

21

is present.

I submit to the Court that the issue in this

2

the opening of the bag and the testing cf the contents?
HR. PETERSON;

have been issued without the testing, a warrant issued

You think we — you think we — as

the case comes here there -- there’s been a holding that

there was no probable cause prior to the testing, and

that’s the way we should judge the case?
MB. PETERSON;

7
8

That's -- that's correct, Mr.

Justice White.
QUESTION:

And the only way the Government

10

then can win the case is by our holding that the -- that

the testing is not a search at all subject to the Fourth

MR. PETERSON:

No.

We have -- we have

2

conceded, both in our brief and below, that the

3

appearance of the white powder in the plastic baggies in

4

the circumstances of this case provided reasonable

5

grounds for a seizure, but that is a totally different

6

question from the question which we submit —

could have gotten a warrant then.

MR. PETERSON:

In all likelihood, they could

11

have gotten a warrant if they had seized it, presented

12

the facts known to them at the time to a United States

magistrate.

packages —

There's little doubt in my mind that they

QUESTION:

Well, then, you — a valid warrant.

17

MR. PETERSON:

18

The point I was attempting to make earlier is

Correct.

19

that the result which we maintain in this case would not

20

require search warrants for all chemical tests, the vast

21

majority of them are valid for other reasons, usually

22

because there's a prior Fourth Amendment justification

23

for the testing itself.

26

the scope of a prior private warrantless search.

HR. PETERSON;

believe there is some evidence in the record -- and I

confess I can't recall if it's in the Joint Appendix —

which

the Court has identified as important is a single

23

familiar standard to guide the police who are out in the

know what rule is going to control their behavior.
27

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

I would submit that by following Walther in

2

this case, that standard will be not only reaffirmed but

3

also be made clearer.

4

parties have conducted a search of an item such as a

5

package, the police can examine it to the same extent

6

that the private parties did, but they can go no further

7

if there is an expectation of privacy in that particular

item without obtaining a search warrant.

It's very simple.

After private

It's simple, it's identifiable, and it's
10

easily implemented; and we submit that it should be

11

followed in this case.

12

QUESTION;

Then how do you respond to your

13

opponent’s argument based on Burdeau against McDowell

14

that this stack of papers were turned ever to the — to

15

the Government, and they don't really know the extent to

16

which the private party might have read all those papers?

17

MB. PETERSON;

Well, the — the simplistic

18

response to your question, Justice Stevens, is that they

1

should call the private party and find out.

20

dealing with private papers, of course, you do have —

21

you have another problem because of the possible Fifth

22

Amendment implications of your activity.

When you're

do in that situation would be to since you have the item

anyway, there’s no danger that you're going to lose any

2

of it or the potential defendant is going to take it

from you.

particularly when search warrants are so easily

You just go get a search warrant,

QOESTIONi

6

In this case you say it’s your

7

position, I gather. Hr. Peterson, that the Government

8

could search to the same extent that the FEA people had
searched; so that would have left them at the most

10

extreme point of the FEA’s — looking at a clear plastic

11

bag with powder inside.
Now, do you concede at that point that they

12

13

would have had probable cause to seize that as

14

contra band ?
HR. PETERSONs

15

Yes.

I can seize — I concede,

16

excuse me, Justice Rehnguist, that they had probable

17

cause to seize it at that time, and that’s exactly what

18

they should have done and then gone to get a warrant

which they got within a hour anyway.

So you think that although they had

MR. PETERSONs

That is a question, Justice

4

Rehnquist, which I think would probably be answered

5

based upon this Court's decisions in New York v. Belton

6

and United States v. Robinson.

7

In Robinson, as you will recall, the Court

8

held that incident to a valid arrest you can search the

9

entire person of the person arrested, and in that case

10

the issue was whether you could search a rumpled --

11

rumpled up cigarette package containing cocaine.

12

In Belton the issue was the permissible scope

13

of a search incident to a valid arrest in an

14

automobile.

15

interior or the automobile, all the containers found

16

within, and I believe the person as well.

that issue were to arise based on those two decisions

9
10

present, he would tell the pusher that you weren't
listening to what I was saying, because —

11

(Laughter.)

12

— Once you sold

that heroin or whatever it

13

was to the informant or cooperating individual or

14

whatever, you relinquished your expectation of privacy

15

in that package, you didn't care what he did with it, in

16

17

had no legitimate expectation of privacy, and you have

18

no basis for claiming that your rights were violated by

what he did with that package.

22

you probably never wanted to see it again; sc you

And I suppose the same rationale

vaguely could apply to incident to arrest.

the other examples of field tests or chemical tests of

25

prior Fourth Amendment justification for the search

which is involved, whether it be a valid search warrant,

3

a hand-to-hand buy or what have you.

4

think it’s accurate to say that this situation just does

5

not arise that frequently.

6

And,

therefore, I

One thing that I think should be discussed

7

here is the expectation of privacy which one has in

8

packages, and is set forth in our brief as early as Ex

9

parte Jackson, recently reaffirmed in Place.

There is a

10

legitimate expectation of privacy in sealed containers

11

traveling via common carrier.

12

I would like to emphasize one thing regarding

13

this case, that being that as stated in the opinion in

14

the Walther decision, a person’s expectation of privacy

15

in a package which is shipped by a common carrier is

16

established at the time that it is shipped, not at the

17

time that it is searched by somebody, whether it be the

18

FBI or someone else.

19

And I think it’s worth noting that the

20

Government has never challenged that language in

21

Walther; they have never addressed our assertion that

22

that is in fact the law.

23

still accepts that position, it's clear that the search

24

here was a search of a package, and therefore, under

25

Chadwick and any number of other decisions, it was

Well, but in — in that case it

believe the Government here takes the position that just

MR. PETERSON;

that the Government stated every time you see white

powder

believe it's contraband.

And —

But they didn't say every time you

see papers in a plastic sack it's cause to believe it's

9

MR. PETERSON;

The only point I was making is

10

that if you — if you assume that the presence of such

11

plastic baggie in a package provides probable cause to

12

sei2e that package, then whatever else is in there, if

13

it is anything else, apparently you don't have an

14

expectation of privacy in that either.

15

QUESTION;

I didn't think the Government's

16

submission was based just on the fact it was a baggie,

17

but that you could see a white powder in a baggie, and

18

that the combination was what gave you probable cause.

19

MR. PETERSON;

Well, maybe that is the case.

20

In any event, I disagree with the Government's

21

contention that a plastic baggie containing powder or

22

any transparent container of powder is so uniquely

23

attributable to contraband that you can automatically

24

seize it and search it.

Okay.

Assuming that the border

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

can be made that clearly you have an expectation of

privacy in that package.

the suspicious circumstances which you described, Mr.

4

Chief Justice, there should be an exception allowing

The question is whether due to

The argument can be made that that is in fact

7

a search because it is a scientific entry of a place

8

where you have a legitimate expectation of privacy, but

9

due to essentially, I guess, the exigency of the

10

situation and the suspicious circumstances, it may net

11

be held to be a search.
I guess it's probably closer to the dog

13

sniffing situation in United States v. Place, which

although this Court held that that was not a search

because there was no physical —

MR. PETERSON:

18

That's correct, Justice

Marshall.

And although I don't believe that that was

clearly explicated in that — that opinion, that perhaps

is the basis for it.

22

physical entry of the suitcase which was sniffed, and it

23

was in a public place, and certainly there was no

24

destruction of any of the contents of the suitcase.

I don't think that supports the fact that there was no

There is no — there was no

I think it's been clearly recognized by this

2
3

Court that although containers or packages are the items

4

in which privacy expectation is recognized, the true

5

principal privacy interest is in the contents

themselves, as recognized in Chadwick.
Secondly, the Government has suggested that

7
8

the Fourth Amendment does net apply to contraband or the

9

molecular structure of contraband.

They cite no cases

10

in support of that proposition.

11

this Court’s decision in United States v. Jeffers, which

12

is cited in our brief, plus a number of other cases

13

where there were an expectation of privacy — in

14

pornographic films, or drugs, or illegal phone calls,

15

illegal coins, what have you — has been found would

18

I would submit that

I’d like to discuss the so-called plain view

19

doctrine under the circumstances of this case, and my

20

basic position is that it simply is irrelevant, and it

21

does not apply for a number of reasons.

22

Number one, application of the plain view

23

doctrine ignores the fact that the expectation of

24

privacy of Respondents is based upon the condition of

25

the package at the time it was sent and not afterwards.
39

But even setting that aside, the plain view doctrine

2

applies to seizures.

And as I've stated before, I’ve
The police

Now, at one point the Government in its brief

calls the entry of the packages and the testing just

another seizure in addition to the one which had already

8

taken place.

9

with semantics, and it just doesn't make any common

10
11

I would submit that that is just playing

sense.
The Government also cites the decision in

12

United States v. Lisk, which is an opinion of Justice

13

Stevens when he was a circuit court judge.

14

stated, among other things, that a search involves an

15

invasion of privacy; a seizure is a taking of property.

16

There he

I would submit in this case that the package

17

was seized when the DEA came into possession of it.

18

Everything that happened after that was a search.

19

fact that what the DEA did to the package was a search

20

is supported by Cardwell v. Lewis where the taking of

21

paint scrapings was a search; Cupp v. Murphy where the

22

taking of fingernail scrapings was a search —

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

2

precisely the same if the bag had had a tiny rip in it

3

at the time this all happened?

MR. PETERSONs

And the agents just dumped the

SR. PETERSONs

I

I guess my case might be a

11

little bit more difficult, but I don't think it would be

12

crucial had it happened that way.

13

The second reason that plain view does not

14

apply in this case is that it's well established that in

15

order for plain view to apply, there's got to be an

16

antecedent Fourth Amendment justification for the police

17

officers' presence.

18

They weren't present to execute a warrant to make an

19

arrest or anything else.

20

the package, and therefore, there was no prior

21

justification.

22

That clearly did not exist here.

They were only here to seize

The third element is that their discovery cf

23

the evidence must be inadvertent, as recently

24

established again in Texas v. Erown.

25

they can't have known in advance that they were going to

In other words,

41

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

seize the item that they seize.

Here they clearly did

2

know about it beforehand, and they found exactly what

3

they were looking for.

4

Therefore, we contend that plain view, which

6

only applies to seizures anyway, simply does not apply

6

in this case.

7

In conclusion, we — we submit that this case

8

is governed not only by Walther v. United States but

9

other well-established and longstanding decisions

10

recognizing the expectation of privacy in packages; and

11

we would urge the Court to affirm the decision of the

12

United States Court of Appeals in this case.

MR. STRAUSSi

Mr. Chief Justice, Just twc

points of clarification.
If the Court disagrees with our submission and

21

concludes that this is in fact a search, it does not

22

follow, as -- as has been suggested during my friend's

23

argument, that — it certainly does not follow that we

24

have to obtain a warrant which, as I said, would be

25

extraordinarily burdensome; and it doesn't even follow
42

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

that we have to have probable cause, because the privacy

2

interests are so limited — we think so limited they're

3

not a search.

4

reasonable suspicion would surely be enough to justify

5

this sort of limited invasion.

6

Eut if the Court concludes otherwise,

The second point is that when considering

whether the chemical analysis is a search, it's

important to remember that we’re talking about

substances that are already lawfully in the possession

10

of the agents.

way cocaine users use it — all without even conceivably

15

violating any other Fourth Amendment interest.

That means they can hold it in their
