P'R'OCE'ED'I'NG'S
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. RAPPAPORT, ESQ.

Mr. Rappaport, I think

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RAPPAPORT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

8

The issue in this case is whether the Court of

9

Appeals of the State of New York properly suppressed the

10

defendant's statement, the gun is over there, as having

11

been elicited in violation of his federal constitutional

12

rights and, if so, whether they also properly suppressed

13

the defendant's subsequent statements admitting ownership

14

of the gun, and the gun itself which was recovered seconds

15

after the statement.

16

This Court has made it clear that the primary

17

purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter police

18

misconduct.

19

instant case, however, there is simply no purpose to be

20

served by exclusion of any of the evidence obtained as a

21

result of his actions.

22

Since Officer Kraft acted properly in the

Briefly, the facts of the case are that Officer

23

Kraft had probable cause to believe that the Respondent

24

had committed a rape and was in possession of a gun in a

25

supermarket.

When the Respondent saw Officer Kraft, he
3

sight of him for a few seconds, caught up to him,

3

handcuffed him, frisked him, found an empty shoulder

gun.

asked the defendant, is this your gun?

said, yes.

Kraft pursued, lost

The defendant

bought it.

11

Under the circumstances then, it is our position

12

that Officer Kraft acted in a necessary and prudent

13

fashion in securing that gun as quickly as he could.

14

The contention of the Respondent or of the Court

15

of Appeals, of course, was that Officer Kraft's action was

16

prescribed by this Court's opinion in Miranda versus

17

Arizona.

18

If one examines the considerations underlying

19

the Miranda opinion, however, it becomes clear that none

20

of those considerations apply in the case at bar.

21

Specifically, the Miranda opinion talked about a

22

lengthy interrogation in an incommunicado atmosphere with

23

abusive police practices that lead to unreliable

24

confessions.

25

Well, in the instant case, we have a single
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

question asked at a public place for the purpose of

2

protection of the police officers and any members of the

3

public who might be in the vicinity and there were no

4

abusive police practices because the officers had already

5

holstered their weapons at the time that the question was

6

asked, and the defendant's statement was completely

7

reliable and its reliability was, in fact, proved seconds

8

later when the gun was located exactly where the

9

Respondent said that it would be.

10

Of course, it may be said that even if the

11

considerations underlying the Miranda opinion do not apply

12

to the case, the holding of the Miranda opinion requires

13

suppression of the defendant's statement and the

14

derivative evidence.

15
16

QUESTION:

Miranda opinion, was there a holding in Miranda?

17
18

When you say the holding of the

holding of the case was that —

QUESTION:

20

opinion, wasn't it?

21

22

Court decided.

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

the considerations underlying the opinion which take up a

2

great portion of the body of the opinion.

3

you want to call it dicta or holding, the Court certainly

4

prescribed certain rules for police officers to follow.

5

6
7

QUESTION:

But, whether

There have been quite a few cases

since then.
MR. RAPPAPORT:

There have been many cases since

8

then, of course, interpreting that.

9

of course, that while we are willing to concede for

It is our position,

10

purposes of our argument that defendant was in custody at

11

the time the question was asked, we submit he was not

12

subjected to interrogation.

13

Now, there was language in the Miranda opinion

14

itself exempting from the definition of custodial

15

interrogation general on-the-scene questioning as to facts

16

surrounding a crime.

17

however, whether such questioning can occur when an

18

individual was in custody.

The opinion itself left open,

19

Now, this Court did not return to the definition

20

of interrogation for purposes of the Fifth Amendment until

21

1980 in Rhode Island versus Innis.

22

the Court held that in addition to express questioning

23

interrogation also includes any words or actions on the

24

part of the police officer other than those normally

25

attendant in arrest and custody which the police should

In Innis, of course,

know are pretty likely to elicit an incriminating

2

response..

3

Now, if that Innis standard —

4

QUESTION:

In Innis the Court seems to have

5

decided that unlike Williams against Brewer that there was

6

no question put to Innis.

7

one policeman to another which was said to have stimulated

8

the response of the accused.

9
10

11
12

MR. RAPPAPORT:
QUESTION:

There was a statement made by

That is correct.

This question was directed to the

accused, was it not?
MR. RAPPAPORT:

Yes, it was.

Of course, it was.

13

But, I was about to say that if the Innis standard were to

14

be applied to the case at bar, we would submit that the

15

question, where is the gun, posed to an individual who is

16

being arrested for an armed felony, and when there is

17

reason to believe that there is a gun in the immediate

18

vicinity of the arrest in a public place, it must be

19

considered normally attendant to the arrest and custody of

20

that individual.

21

However, as you point out, the Innis opinion

22

itself did not involve an express question and we would

23

submit that on the face of the opinion the standard set

24

forth in this was not meant to apply to express questions.

25

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Rappaport, certainly the
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

language in Rhode Island versus Innis seemed to indicate

2

that questions reasonably likely to elicit incriminating

3

responses were not allowable in the absence of the Miranda

4

warnings.

5

certainly contrary to that as to the admissibility of the

6

response to that question.

7

And, it seems to me that your proposal is

MR. RAPPAPORT:

Well, I think, Justice O'Connor,

8

that the face of the Innis opinion says that interrogation

9

is either express questioning or the functional equivalent

10

of express questioning and then went on to define the

11

functional equivalent of express questioning in terms of

12

whether it is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating

13

response.

14

Again, as the Chief Justice pointed out, the

15

Innis opinion itself did not involve an express question

16

and the standard it was formulating was not intended to

17

apply to express questions.

18

Now, there have been, however, many state and

19

lower federal court opinions which have answered the

20

question which both Miranda and Innis left open,

21

specifically whether any expressed questions asked of an

22

individual in custody can not be considered interrogation

23

for purposes of Miranda.

24

universally accepted that booking and pedigree questions

25

do not constitute interrogation.

Specifically — It is

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

Secondly, there are a series of cases from many

2

jurisdictions relying on the language of Miranda involving

3

general on-the-scene questioning referring to questions

4

preliminary or neutral or designed to clarify the nature

5

of the situation confronted.

6

What all of these cases have in common is this

7

recognition that sometimes expressed questions asked of an

8

individual in custody may not constitute interrogation.

9

think it depends on the nature of the question asked.

10
11

QUESTION:

This question goes to the very heart

of the offense, doesn't it?

12

MR. RAPPAPORT:

Well, given that the offense

13

now — The only charge left open now is the possession of

14

the weapon.

15
16
17

Of course, it does.

QUESTION:

That is pretty incriminating, I

suppose.
MR. RAPPAPORT:

There is no question that that

18

is incriminating, but the mere fact that the answer to a

19

question might be incriminating or is even likely to be

20

incriminating does not necessarily mean that Miranda

21

prescribes the question to be asked.

22

More specifically relevant to the instant case,

23

there have been many or at least several state and lower

24

court cases dealing with the issue of questioning a

25

defendant about the presence of a weapon in the immediate

I

1

vicinity of the arrest.

2

held that such questioning does not constitute

3

interrogation.

4

And, these cases have generally

Now, sometimes they use the same reasoning as

5

the general on-the-scene questioning cases, talking

6

about — saying that the question about a weapon, in fact,

7

was designed to clarify the nature of the situation —

8

QUESTION:

9

the Sullivan law in New York.

10

Well, it is a question about a crime,

MR. RAPPAPORT:

Yes, of course, it is a question

11

about a crime, Justice Marshall, but the question, what is

12

going on here, when there is a crime going on —

13

QUESTION:

No, this was specific.

Where is the

14

gun and to have a gun is a violation of the law in New

15

York unless you have a permit.

16

have you committed a crime?

17

MR. RAPPAPORT:

So, you are asking him,

I think in this situation the

18

duty of Officer Kraft and I think, apparent from the

19

record, the intention of Officer Kraft was not to

20

investigate the possession of a weapon or even to

21

investigate the rape charge, but his intention was to

22

secure this weapon.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. RAPPAPORT:

25

He had already frisked him.
He had already frisked him and

determined that the weapon was not on the defendant's
10

1

person, but it could have been, and very likely was, in

2

the immediate vicinity of the Respondent in a supermarket,

3

and the obligation of the police officer at that point was

4

to secure that weapon.

5

QUESTION:

As a practical matter, Mr. Rappaport,

6

precisely that question, precisely that question could

7

have been addressed to one of the clerks or customers in

8

the store if they were standing nearby, near enough to see

9

what had been done with the gun, is that not so?

10

MR. RAPPAPORT:

11

QUESTION:

Of course, that is so.

So, the response of the customer or

12

the clerk would not involve a question about a crime,

13

would it?

14

MR. RAPPAPORT:

That is correct.

And, the fact

15

that the question was addressed to the Respondent, as

16

opposed to someone else who might or might not have been

17

at the scene, should not change our view of the

18

obligations of the police officer in that instance.

19

obligation was to secure that weapon.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Rappaport, I guess there are

21

other issues that you raise in the case.

22

to discuss those during your presentation?

23

MR. RAPPAPORT:

24

QUESTION:

25

His

Did you expect

I would like to discuss those.

And, would you mind mentioning

whether you raised those issues in the courts below?

1

MR. RAPPAPORT'

2

Just to conclude on this issue, however, I think

Certainly.

3

an alternative rationale with respect to the admission of

4

the first statement would be to say that it doesn't really

5

matter whether you call this interrogation or not, but the

6

exigent circumstances of having the gun loose in the

7

supermarket overrode the necessity for Miranda warnings.

8
9

Also, it is undisputed that the officer had a
right to search the defendant.

Given that right, it is up

10

to Congress to say he does not have the right also to ask

11

him where the gun was.

12

use, however, the point is that Officer Kraft acted

13

properly and, given that fact, there is no reason to

14

suppress the evidence.

15

Whichever theory you choose to

Now, it is also our position that if, in fact,

16

it is found that the defendant's initial statement was to

17

be suppressed, then the subsequent statement and the gun

18

itself need not be suppressed.

19

Now, first of all, we made an argument regarding

20

Michigan versus Tucker, and as I think you were alluding

21

to —

We did not make that argument in the courts below.
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

It is our position though that we did raise the federal

2

question regarding whether the derivative evidence had to

3

be excluded given the initial violation.

4
5

MR. RAPPAPORT:

And, in what court or courts did

you raise that?

6

MR. RAPPAPORT:

We raised that in the Appellate

7

Division of the State Supreme Court of New York and in the

8

Court of Appeals of the State of New York.

9

In the hearing court, in fact, no arguments of

10

any kind were made by the representative of our office.

11

We do not think that precludes us from raising particular

12

issues on appeal.

13

If the record — As we —

18

chance to really be on the other side is if the trial

court rules against and you go to the Appellate Division.

Well, that is exactly our

21

position.

That is why the Assistant District Attorney,

22

who was at that hearing, did not feel it necessary to make

23

a particular argument at the hearing.

24

think that precludes us from raising these issues on

25

appeal.

Again, we do not

You weren't precluded from making

those arguments in the State Appellate Court.

6

MR. RAPPAPORT:

We were not precluded from

making the arguments.

8

Division, the intermediate court, did not issue a decision

9

on the matter, and the New York State Court of Appeals did

In fact, the State Appellate

10

not discuss the issue of inevitable discovery.

11

think that because the Court of Appeals did not discuss

12

it, however, that that necessarily implies —

QUESTION:

We do not

Well, if you made the argument and

they ignored it, they necessarily rejected it.

15

MR. RAPPAPORT:

Well, they necessarily rejected

16

it, but we think that that rejection is subject to review

17

by this Court.

18

That is the point I am trying to make.

Well, with respect to the argument with regard

19

to Michigan versus Tucker, of course, we believe that this

20

would not be a Fifth Amendment violation even if, in fact,

21

the question was a violation of this Court's opinion in

22

Miranda.

23

resemblance to the historical practices at which the Fifth

24

Amendment was aimed.

25

The conduct at issue here certainly bears no

Therefore, the Wong Sun test for determining the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

admissibility of derivate evidence need not be applied and

2

there should be a balancing between the benefits and

3

detriments of exclusion of the derivative evidence.

4

think if one does that balancing, it is clear that the

5

deterrent effect of excluding the derivative evidence is

6

minimal.

7

exclusionary rule ever really deters police misconduct.

8

Certainly we are talking about derivative evidence.

9

effect is even lessened because the police officer would

10

not be likely to want to risk losing the full confession

11

in the hope of gaining derivative evidence.

12

14

wasn't it?

It is even questionable to what extent the

21

MR. RAPPAPORT:

So, given the speculative nature

22

of the deterrent value of excluding the evidence, that is

evidence available.

25

would be admissible.

We think that the derivative evidence

Finally, with respect to the issue of inevitable

2

discovery, very briefly we think that there is no question

3

on the facts of this case that that gun would have been

4

discovered without the defendant's statement.

5

think that any extensive testimony, any testimony at all

6

other than that which appeared on the record, was

7

necessary to establish that fact.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS, ESQ.

13

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER

14

MR. STRAUSS:

15
16

Very well.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In Rhode Island against Innis, the Court

17

specifically excepted from its definition of interrogation

18

questions normally attendant to arrest and custody.

19

And, it is our position that Officer Kraft's

20

question, where is the gun, belongs to a definable

21

category of questions that are incident to an arrest; that

22

is to say his question was part of the process of safely

23

and successfully completing the arrest of Respondent.

24

And, in our view, Miranda warnings should not be required

25

before question that is incident to an arrest.
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

Now, when Respondent was asked, where is the

2

gun, he had undoubtedly been seized within the meaning of

3

the Fourth Amendment, and it has been assumed all along

4

that he had been arrested.

5

the court below seemed to believe, that he, therefore, had

6

to be given Miranda warnings immediately before he was

7

asked any questions whatsoever.

8
9

But, it does not follow, as

The concepts of arrest and seizure are Fourth
Amendment concepts.

Miranda rules are derived from the

10

Fifth Amendment which, of course, serves quite different

11

purposes.

12

necessarily to become automatically applicable whenever

13

there is a Fourth Amendment arrest.

14

the purposes of Miranda and, very importantly, it

15

certainly does not provide police officers with any

16

clearer guidance about when they should give Miranda

17

warnings than the interpretation of Miranda that we

18

propose.

And, there is no reason for the Miranda rules

19

QUESTION:

20

think, with the Orozco case?

Is your argument inconsistent, do you

MR. STRAUSS:

21

That does not serve

No, I don't think so, Justice

22

O'Connor.

In that case, there is no indication that the

23

questions they asked were even asked roughly at the same

24

time of the arrest, let alone that they were necessary to

25

completing the process of the arrest.
17

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

I think Orozco can be understood as a case in

2

which the police officers, because they couldn't bring the

3

accused to the station house and interrogate him without

4

Miranda warnings.

5

6

Well, you are not arguing that this

QUESTION:

question was necessary to complete the arrest, are you?

7

MR. STRAUSS:

It was necessary to complete the

8

process of arresting him safely in the same way that

9

searches —

10

QUESTION:

Well, I thought that the handcuffs

11

had already been placed on him and that he had been

12

arrested at the time of the question.

13

He didn't.

He arrested him in the

store in a place where the gun could have been hidden.

I think that is a universal assumption.

questions, the suspect probably doesn't know in the first

It would be worse still if you didn't

know it was there and picked up the carton and it dropped

MR. HYMAN:

But, Your Honor, I believe in Innis

you had even a far more egregious situation of a shotgun
in a school yard near handicapped children.

And, the

court enunicated rather a clear standard at that time.
And, it didn't look — It could have at that time said no
Miranda warnings are required.

There was a gun in the

school yard.
Instead, you look to the nature of the question
and enunciated that once an individual is in custody, as
in this instance, Miranda must be administered and the
question is what is the nature of the question.
In Innis you specifically did not use the safety
aspect as a means of detracting from Miranda.
QUESTION:

Didn't the Court have to decide in

Innis that there was no interrogation of Innis?
MR. HYMAN:

Yes, that was the — But, to get to

that, Mr. Chief Justice, you had to first, I believe, in
reading the opinion, and you specifically stated there,

QUESTION:

Well, I —
— except that the question was

directed here to your client and ostensibly or

superficially the question in Innis was directed by one

You have continued the firm

And, I suggest that Quarles fits within the

5

classic definition of how Miranda has been applied.

6

fits within the custody, it fits within the interrogation.

7

It may be at the line, but if we are to move the line, we

8

will undo, I think, the very firm rules that this Court

9

has so carefully enunciated.
QUESTION:

10

It

Is there any case in this Court where

11

Miranda has been applied to an arrest and questioning in a

12

public place?

13

MR. HYMAN:

No, Your Honor. . There is a case

14

called U.S. v. Watson in which an arrest takes place in a

15

restaurant, as I recall, and this Court comments that he

was immediately given his Miranda warnings.

Now, dealing with, I think, the issue of if this

position of Respondent that the claim with regard to both

admitted, the gun, and the inevitable discovery aspect of

it; that both are not properly before this Court.

Under Gates and under Michigan v. Long, this

Court has set down the framework that indicates what

7

claims should or should not be before it.

8
9

Now, if I may first deal with the nature of the
record.

In this case, no aspect of inevitable discovery

10

or derivative evidence was raised in the court below.

11

is the position of Respondent, substantiated by New York

12

law, that the issue thereafter was not preserved by the

13

people to now argue inevitable discovery or to argue in

14

this Court for the time that derivative evidence should

15

Amendment.

2

MR. HYMAN-

Well, I think, Your Honor, in your

3

opinion in Gates you at least intimate that there is a

4

requirement that arguments be asserted below.

5

QUESTION:

So that the lower courts can pass on

6

them, but I wouldn't think that would apply at the trial

7

stage.

8
9

MR. HYMAN:

Except in New York that is the only

way it can be presented.

It is our argument that the

10

silence by the New York courts, particularly on the issue,

11

which was the only one raised, inevitable discovery, is

12

that that is silence in and of itself is an indication

13

that the court did not pass on it.

Fitzpatrick that was denied in this case.

QUESTION:

That is certainly a

for preserving — You are saying, in effect, that the

proceedings to respond with his kind of federal argument.

Inevitable discovery isn't the raising of a federal

question for the first time.

prevail.

MR. HYMAN:

It is a response to why the

Your Honor, I have several answers

on that.

8

QUESTION:

9

(Laughter)

10

MR. HYMAN:

Well, give me them all.

Okay.

First, Your Honor, I

11

should note that Your Honor's indication with respect to

12

the issue about raising in the state courts is not present

13

at all with the issue of derivative evidence.

14

in any of the state courts, either the trial court, the

15

appellate division, or the court of appeals did this issue

16

of whether or not the gun, independent of the statement,

17

be admitted.

18

At no time

I believe that, therefore, the claim, as this

19

Court has defined in it Gates, was not a cert.

20

that extent, Your Honor, I believe, with regard to that

21

issue, it certainly has not been preserved to here.

22
23
24
25

So, to

And, that would only leave the question of the
inevitable discovery.

And, that is one aspect.

The second, Your Honor, is that there could be a
spearate finding by the state court on the issues of what
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

evidence is admissible or not admissible in a court of the

2

State of New York.

3

By not raising the issue in the trial court —

4

We have cases that have indicated that the Appellate

5

Division and the Court of Appeals will not hear argument

6

even on the part of the state after they have failed to

7

make that argument below.
There is a case not cited in our brief called

8
9

People v. Iochi, which is at 61 Appellate Division 2d 1,

10

which indicates that the People themselves, that is the

11

State of New York, whereas here the defendants were not

12

placed on notice that the People were resisting the

13

applications on the ground of lack of standing and the

14

defendant might have introduced proof to establish their

right to make the application.

QUESTION:

of cross currents of legal arguments?

not want to pass on it, they did not have the authority to

13

MR. HYMAN:

You have the power to review de novo

whether a federal question is preserved, but you must at

Your Honor, in dealing with the question of the

jurisdictional aspect, I would like to point out that in

9

the New York Court of Appeals opinion with respect to the

10

preservation issue, the Court does not deal, of course, at

all with inevitable discovery, but it does indicate in

that not so far as it appears from the record was there

first federal issue.

7

MR. HYMAN:

But, New York law puts the burden on

8

the People and it says very clearly in its decisions that

9

it must be raised below.

Now, under New York law in

10

People v. Huntley it says that the burden is on the People

11

to prove that which they are seeking to introduce.

12

QUESTION:

I don't know that that has the same

13

adequate independent state ground connotation that a

14

burden on the party raising the federal issue has.

15

MR. HYMAN:

But, I think that — The discussion

16

in Gates would seem at least there must be an equivalency

17

and New York recognizes that equivalency.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

But, Gates didn't get this fine, I

don't think.
MR. HYMAN:

Well, I might also note that what

21

makes this case even more troublesome, I think, than Gates

22

is that we do have independent state grounds upon which

23

the motion was made that the New York law could be that it

24

would admit the evidence.

federal issues.

3

QUESTION:

But, the New York Court of Appeals

spoke only of a constitutional issue.

4

MR. HYMAN:

But, its silence, Mr. Justice

5

Rehnquist, I believe, must be construed that there were

6

grounds that prevented it considering it.

7

I believe in Street that issue — Justice Harlan

8

indicated that where there is silence, there is at least a

9

presumption that the silence is because the Court did not

10

want to deal with the issue because it was not preserved

11

under state law which is what we are arguing here.

12

did not, and, in fact, did not deal with the issue because

13

it was not preserved.

14

Thank you very much.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. RAPPAPORT — Rebuttal
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RAPPAPORT:

With respect to the issue of the

24

independent and adequate state ground, I would like to

25

refer the Court to its opinion in Michigan versus Long
53

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

where the Court said that if, in fact, the state court

2

wishes to base its decision on an independent and adequate

3

state ground, it is incumbent upon that court to make

4

explicit that it intends to do so.

5

Clearly, the New York Court of Appeals in this

6

case did not explicitly base its decision on an

7

independent and adequate state ground.

8
9

QUESTION:

Was this case decided by the Court of

Appeals before we decided Michigan and Long?

10

MR. RAPPAPORT:

11

QUESTION:

12

didn't make that requirement?

13

It was decided before —

Well, then how were they to know we

MR. RAPPAPORT:

Well, I think the fact that the

14

Court had not made that explicit prior to Michigan versus

15

Long does not mean that the reasoning in that case should

16

not be —
QUESTION:

17
18

if it was already the law?
MR. RAPPAPORT:

19

20

Why should we have made it explicit

I am not sure I understand the

question.

21

QUESTION:

Perhaps we made it explicit because a

22

lot of courts weren't catching the obvious, very obvious

23

signal.

24
25

MR. RAPPAPORT:

Well, I think the point is that

there were reasons behind this Court's opinion in Long and
54

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

this case might present a reason for the application of

2

that principle.

3

The only portion of the Court of Appeals

4

decision which could be interpreted as raising an

5

independent and adequate state ground is the portion cited

6

by counsel where he said that the People never raised the

7

issue of the safety of the public as distinguished from

8

the safety of the officers.

9

However, the Court made a finding of fact that

10

the record did not establish that there were, in fact,

11

those circumstances.

12

asking the Court to review now.

13

It is that finding which we are

One other point.

Counsel characterized our

14

discussion of Miranda as permitting an open-ended kind of

15

activity on the part of police and requiring a totality of

16

the circumstances approach.

17

no such thing.

18

any time there is a gun in the immediate vicinity of an

19

arrest in a public place, it is reasonably prudent

20

protective measure for the police to take to ask about the

21

location of that gun.

22

We submit that we are doing

We are saying that objectively speaking

If there is any question of the totality of the

23

circumstances approach, I submit that Respondent is, in

24

effect, asking for that when he can see that well under

25

some circumstances there might be exigent circumstances,

but not in this case.

2

Thank you, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

It is none of our business and you

4

need not comment on it, but one can't help but wonder why

5

a prosecutor thought he needed this evidence.

say, that is not our business.

But, as I
