ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

5
6

Mr. Farrow, you may

NR. FARR*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7 please the Court*
8

This case as it now stands before this Court

9

is essentially a dispute between citizens of the State

10 of Pennsylvania and

the state itself over how to run a

11

state mental retardation program pursuant to state law.

12

The federal court saw fit to decide this dispute

13 imposing upon the state a mandatory presumption in favor
14

of certain types of programs and requiring the state to

15

create and pay for new facilities in accordance with its

16 preference.
17

In our view this federal interference in

18 purely state matters is barred by the Eleventh Amendment
19 and by principles of comity.

Now this afternoon I will

20

discuss the Eleventh Amendment and Allen Warshaw will

21

discuss the issue of comity.

22

Before getting into the details of our

23

Eleventh Amendment argument I think, it might be useful

24

to the Court if we state as straightforwardly as

25

possible just what cur overall possition is.

In short,

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

we believe first that this claim is in fact a claim

2 against the state and not just against state officials?
3 second, that the state is not prevented from claiming
4

its Eleventh Amendment immunity by the doctrine of Ex

5

Parte Young which by its terms and logic applies only to

6 federal claims? and third,
7 immunity against a

that the state may invoke its

pendent claim like the one here just

8 as it may invoke its immunity against primary claims.
9

Now as the statement of this position makes

10

clear proper Eleventh Amendment analysis requires the

11

asking of several separate though related questions.

12 it a claim against the state?
13

of Ex Parte Young?

14

inapplicable to pendent claims?

Is it within the doctrine

Is the Eleventh Amendment somehow

In addressing the first of these questions,

15
16

Is

whether the claim is in fact one against the state,

it

17 is not dispositive that the complaint only names state
18 officials as defendants.

This Court has said on

19 numerous occasions that the courts must look to the
20 nature of the claim and the nature of the relief sought
21

to determine whether it is in effect one against the

22

s ta te.

23
24

There is no bright line to define this

inquiry, but the basic test derived from Larson in 1949 ,

25 a federal case but followed in subsequent cases,

is

4

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

whether the state officials can make a nonfrivolous

2

claim that they are acting even if mistakenly within the

3

general ambit of their colorable authority under state

4

law .
QUESTION*

5
6

Mr. Farr, you refer to Larson as

being a federal case, but the plurality there in

7 Treasure Salvors pretty much adopted that as an Eleventh
8

Amendment rule, too.
MR. FARR*

9

Now in this case despite all of Respondents*

10
11

That is correct, yes, sir.

allegations about lawless behavior, we think it control

12 that defendants or the persons charged by state law with
13

making the numerous almost day-to-day discretionary

14

decisions about operation of the state mental

15

retardation program including the very decisions that

16

are at issue in this case, what kind of facilities to

17 create, what kinds of persons to put in those kinds of
18

facilities, what kinds of services and programs to

19

provid e.
Furthermore, it is clear that these defendants

20
21

must make these decisions within the limits of the

22

funding provided by the state legislature.

23

simply

24

from the State Treasury the money to pay for those

25

decisions.

Respondents

wanted to make different decisions and to exact

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

But under the tests set down by this Court

2

that is the very essence of a suit against the state

3 itself.

Now the second question is whether even

though

4

the claim is functionally one against the state itself

5

it is within the venerable doctrine of Ex Parte Yeung

6

for if the claim were that the state officials were

7

violating the federal constitution or federal law then

8 Ex Parte Young says that the state cannot give them its
9
10

immunity from the Eleventh Amendment.
They are required to be obedient to the

11

superior authority of federal law, but Young has never

12

been thought to apply to state law claims like the ones

13 here not should it be.

The practical need for the

14

so-called fiction of Ex Parte voung that the state

15

officials are stripped of their representative character

16 is necessary to be able to enforce the Fourteenth
17
18

Amendment and other federal laws.
The language of this Court in Edelman to turn

19 the Civil Rights Amendments from a shield into a sword
20

but that need is not present when you are dealing with

21

only a state law claim.

22

between the local and the national government is much

23

better preserved with important state issues by having

In fact, the proper balance

24 those questions decided by a state court.
25

QUESTION*

Yr. Farr, let me just be sure I

6

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

understand one point.

You do agree if it were a federal

2

statutory claim then you would say that would he covered

3

by Ex Parte Young?

4

MR. FARR:

I do.

Yes, I do.

5

The third inquiry and one by its terms which

6

is an odd one to be asking at all is whether the

7

Eleventh Amendment is somehow inapplicable to pendent

8 claims.
9

Although some earlier cases concedingly seem to

incline in that direction without we think very much

10

consideration of the issue, we think that the decision

11

in Edelman v. Jordan settled and settled correctly that

12

issue for once and for all.

13

In Edelman —

14

QUESTION:

Let me see if I understand your

15

response to Justice Stevens.

16

asserts a federal question.

17

MR. FARR:

Suppose the complaint
Does that end the matter?

As far as that particular claim

18

goes the Court would have tc, cf course, see whether it

19

had Article III jurisdiction over it.

Rut if it seeks^

20 injunctive relief under a federal claim that is
21
22
23

permitted by Ex Parte Young.
QUESTION:

You mean a statutory claim that

would preclude the official doing what he is doing.

24

MR. FARR:

That is correct.

25

For example, in --

7

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

QUESTIONi

That was preemption, for example.

2

ilB. FARE:

Ray v. Atlantic Richfield is the

3 example I was going to give where the Court said

that

4

the state officials by carrying out the state law in

5

that case were preempted by federal law and were willing

6

to give an injunction against the carrying out of state

7

law.

That does not extend to retroactive relief but

8 other than that the federal claims are within Ex Parte
9

10

Young.
Turning back to Edelman and the question of

11

pendent claims,

in Edelman the situation was that there

12

was a primary claim which was an equal protection claim

13 under the Fourteenth Amendment, a claim which in and of
14

itself would be permitted by Ex Parte Young.

15

in effect two pendent claims under federal law.

16
17

There were

The Court examined each of these claims,
determined that one claim was permitted because it was

18 under federal law and it sought injunctive relief as I
19 was saying to the Chief Justice and decided that the
20 other claim was barred by the Eleventh

Amendment because

21

it was a federal claim hut sought retroactive relief.

22

The same analysis applies here.

23

This pendent claim is barred by the Eleventh

24

Amendment not because it seeks retroactive relief but

25

because it is a state claim to which Fx Parte Young does

P

not apply at all
QUESTIONS

2

It would help if you let us know

3

what you are calling a state claim.

The kind of a state

4

claim you are talking about I take it is a claim that

5

the official is acting outside the scope of his

6

authority.

7

MR. FARE;

That is correct.

8

QUESTION;

Just in terms of state law he

9

The state —

should net be doing what he is doing.

10

MR. FARR;

That is correct.

11

QUESTIONS

You concede that if there was an

12

allegation,

13

acting completely outside the -- He has even no

14

colorable authority under state law.

15

Amendment still —
MR. FARRs

16
17

would you or would you not, that he is

Would the Eleventh

In that situation if the allegation

was that he was so outside cf his authority that he

18 effectively was acting without any authority at all then
19

I think it would not be a claim against the state.
QUESTION;

20
21

that.

I guess we do not have to decide

In this case nobody is claiming — They are just

22 claiming that state officials were misapplying state
23 law .
24
25

MR. FARR;

I think if they get up on their

feet they will claim that it is lawless and horrible and

9

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

all of that, but I think basically the claim is that

2

they are simply not making the right decision under

3

state law.

4

QUESTION:

Misconstruing state law.

5

MR. FARR*

That is correct.

6

QUESTION:

Khat you are saying is you cannot

7 convert a dispute over the applicability of the state
8 law into a claim of

"lawlessness” or totally without

9 authority.

MR. FARR:

10

Absolutely.

I think what you have

11

to look at is whether the defendants can make a

12

nonfrivolous defense that they are acting within state

13

law.

14 stops.
15

I think once you have got that then the inquiry
Otherwise you are going to have a situation

where the Eleventh Amendment means something only if you

16 actually go through and decide the merits of the state
17 law which is not much help.
18

QUESTION:

Rationally should you be able for

19 Eleventh Amendment purposes to distinguish between some
20 official who is acting totally outside of his authority
21

and some official who is just misconstruing state law?

22

MR. FARR;

I think —

23

QUESTION;

Maybe Larson did, but does it make

24
25

a whole lot of sense?
MR. FARR:

I think there are two points about

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that, Kr. Justice White.

One is that I think that it

2

makes sense only at the very outer boundary which is the

3

mere fact that somebody happens tc be employed by the

4

state, of course, does not mean that he can go around

5

and do whatever he wants and claim an Eleventh Amendment

6

immunity in a federal court.

7

QUESTION:

Why should that not —

8

QUESTION:

If you are only making a state law

9

claim why should — As you say the rationale of Ex Parte

10

Young should not reach that either, should not reach any

11

state claim.

12

HE. FAEF:

Well, I think you do not need the

13

— What I am saying is that there are points at which

14

the behavior is so far outside the boundary that it

15

really is just personal behavior that someone is

16

committing an assault on his own time.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Why do you conclude from that that

the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the suit?
MR. FARE:

Because then I would say that there

20 is really no statement involvement at all and it is
21

somebody who is just acting on his individual — If

22 somebody is driving his car for pleasure or something
23

and he is sued in a diversity suit, that might be a

24

situation where he just cannot say because I

25

incidentally happen to have a job some of the rest of

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 6284300

1

the time with the state I am covered by the Eleventh

2 Amendm ent.
But I think it is a very, very narrow

3
4

limitation and particularly because Larson, of course,

5 is a federal case.

In Larson the situation is if you do

6 not give some leeway for allowing those kinds of suits
7 they are effectively barred completely by sovereign
8 immunity.

But in the context of a claim against a state

9

10 official the only question we are addressing here is
11

whether these claims can be brought in federal court.

12 They can still be brought in state court and, therefore,
13 there is an alternative way to get those cases
14 resolved.
15

QUESTION;

Mr. Farr, supposing a Pennsylvania

16 statute said in so many words none of these people shall
17 be institutionalized in Pennhurst.

Would the Eleventh

18

Amendment be a claim against someone who says I am being

19

wrongfully institutionalized at Pennhurst?

20
21

MR. FARR;

I think there is a level at which

the statutes or the state law might be so absolutely

22 clear that all the state officials had where they
23

effectively had no discretion it was simply a

24

ministerial carrying out.

I think under the cases of

25 this Court that sort of case might be allowed in.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

2

Whether that case is clear enough?

QUESTION:

The statute says no one shall be

placed in Pennhurst.
ME. FARE:

7
8

ME. FARE:

If they say absolutely —

5
6

What is your answer to my specific

case?

3
4

QUESTION:

And the state appropriates no money

to support Pennhurst and they just do it on their own.
QUESTION:

9

No, they still pay the bills at

10

Pennhurst.

11

the statute says no one shall be institutionalized at

12

Pennhurst during 1983.
ME. FARR:

13
14

They do exactly what they are doing new, but

Well, the reason that I raised the

funding is if you are saying that nobody shall be

15 admitted to Pennhurst and there is a flat prohibition I
16

would think under the cases of this Court that

17 nondiscretionary matter might be within the Treasure
18

Salvors notion that somebody is proceeding outside the

19

scope.

20
21

QUESTION:

So then the question I gather the

way you present the argument is whether the holding in

22 the Pennsylvania case on which
23
24
25

the Third Circuit relied

is that clear or not that clear.
MR. FARR:

Well, I certainly think it is net

that clear.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

QUESTIONi

1

So then the question, I gather, as

2

the way you present the argument is whether the holding

3

in the Pennsylvania case on which the Third Circuit

4 relied is that clear or not that clear.
MR. FARR;

5
6

Well, I certainly think it’s net

that clear.
QUESTIONi

7

But if it were that clear,

then

8

you'd say well, then the Eleventh Amendment would be no

9

def ense .

10

11

MR. FARE*

It is possible to me that a

judicial decision cculd be as clear as a statute.

12 certainly would concede that.

I

But I would in no way

13 concede that Joseph Schmidt is that clear.

He went to

14 an institution.
15

QUESTIONi

Mr. Farr?

16

MR. FARRi

Yes, sir.

17

QUESTIONS

Did the court of appeals make any-

18 finding that these officials had acted beyond the scope
19 of their authority?
20

21

MR. FARR;

They did not address the question

at all in those terms, Justice Powell.

They simply took

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Did the district court make any

finding in that respect?
MR. FAREs

No, they did not.

The district

14

1

court, in fact, to the extent they made any finding at

2 all, indicated, although they found a violation of state
3

law as such, indicated that the officials were acting in

4 good faith and within the scope of their authority for
5 purposes of giving them a qualified immunity on the
6

damage claim»
QUESTION*

7

8 a party to this case?

Is the Department of Public Welfare
I've understood it was.

9

MR. FflRHi

Yes.

10

QUESTIONS

It's a state agency.

11

MR. FARRs

It is a state agency.

12

QUESTIONS

And it's the agency that oversees

13

I guess I believe it is.

the operation of Pennhurst and other mental hospitals.
MR. FARRs

14

That's correct.

Now, the claim is

15 certainly barred, I believe, against any state agency in
16

fact.

Cf course, what we're saying is that even though

17 there are individual state officials named as well, the
18

claim is barred with respect to them, too, because it is

19

still —

20

21

QUESTIONS

Well, the agency can operate only

through officials and its other personnel.

22

MR. FARRs

That's correct.

23

QUESTIONS

Mr. Farr, what about actions of

24 city or county officials under your theory?
25

MR. FARRs

^he actions of the city and county

15

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

officials are typically not subject to the same Eleventh

2

Amendment analysis, but the situation you have here is

3 that their activities essentially are to carry out the
4

state law.

The state provides all of the funding, and

5

therefore, if the presumption is in effect and the new

6 community facilities must be created, and people must be
7 moved into those facilities, the state bears 100 percent
8

of the cost of that.

And we think,

therefore, in these

circumstances you can't get around that by simply naming
10

the counties who have no fiscal responsibility separate

11

from that of the state.

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to save the
remainder of my time for rebuttal, if I may.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN C. WARSHAW, ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

18
1
20

21

MR. WARSHAW;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
Even if the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a
federal court decision on the state law issues in this

22 case, principles of comity do not.

Rather, those

23

principles prohibit federal courts as a matter cf

24

self-restraint from interfering with the operation of

25 complex state programs except when it's absolutely

16

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

2

necessary to protect federal rights.
Indeed, this Court has applied this rule to

3

prevent the exercise of federal jurisdiction over

4

federal claims when state forums were available to

5 consider those claims.

The rule is based in large on

6

principles of federalism which require federal courts to

7

respect the independence of local governments, state and

8 county, in matters of local concern, especially when
9

those matters involve the expenditure, as in this case,

10 or the collection of monies.
11

However, it is a rule which is also based on

12 the very practical consideration that even the most
13

simple and obvious principle of state law will involve

14

incalculable legal and nonlegal complexities in its

15 application to ongoing state programs.
16

QUESTIONS

Mr. Warshaw, would you tell me when

17 this issue was first brought into this case?
18

MR. WARSHAW:

It has been raised in various

19 ways at various times in the litigation.

It was raised

20

in this form for the first time in the Third Circuit on

21

the remand when it was first suggested that the lower

22 court order could be justified solely on state law.
23

That was the first time when the respondents argued that

24 the court should ignore the federal court issues and go
25

directly to the state law issues.

17

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

It was argued in the district court when the

2 remedy was based on four federal theories and one state
3

theory and then only in part on the state theory as a

4 limitation on this bill for relief,

and again in the

5 Third Circuit on appeal from those four federal theories
6

and one state finding as a limitation on relief.

But it

7 was raised — and let me add to that that we think it is
8

the kind of issue that has to evolve during the course
of the litigation depending upon the state of the

10 litigation.

11
12

And in this case it is one that was raised

in the form appropriate at every stage of the litigation.
In this regard as to the practical

13 considerations, this Court has recognized the federal
14

courts are limited in their competence to decide the

15 nonlegal issues involved in operating state programs.
16

Instead it has required that federal courts give

17 substantial deference to the professional judgments cf
18 state officials involved in operating those programs,
1

even in cases involving constitutional issues where the

20 federal courts can give a definitive and authoritative

21
22

answer tc the legal issues.
When only state law is involved, federal

23

courts are unable to even give that kind of a resolution

24

of legal issues, and there is, frankly, just no

25

justification for their involvement in the state

18

1

decisionmaking process.

For example, in this case the

2

lower courts have taken a vague right to treatment from

3

a case, In rej Schmidt, in which the Pennsylvania

4

Supreme Court approved placement in an institution, and

5

the lower courts created a presumption from that case in

6 favor of placement in the community.
7

As importantly,

they took that right from a case involving one person

8 where funding was no issue whatsoever and have created a
9
10
11

presumption which applies regardless of cost and
available funding to thousands of people.
To say that that rule is less than definitive

12

and less than authoritative is at the least a severe

13

understatement.

14

avoid rather than to vindicate federal claims, the Third

15

Circuit sanctioned a massive and ongoing intrusion into

Nonetheless, in this case, acting to

16 Pennsylvania's program for the mentally retarded.
17

In so

doing the Third Circuit, we believe, was deluded by the

18 apparent simplicity of the right to treatment in

the

19 least restrictive environment which it believed it had
20

found in state law, and ignored the complexities of its

21

application to even a single person, let alone the

22

thousands of class members in this case.

23

The extent of the resulting intrusion is fully

24

reflected in the district court orders in this case.

25

For example, under those orders state and county

officials are required to prepare and subsequently

2 implement habilitaticn plans for every cne of the class
3 members.

The manner in which those plans and programs

4 are to be implemented, prepared and monitored is
5 strictly governed by the district court’s latest
6

100-page order which dictates the precise form such a

7 plan shall take, the procedure by which it shall be
8

prepared, who shall participate in its preparation and

9 how long it shall take to prepare it and subsequently to
10

implement it.
CHIEF JUSTICE EURGER:

14 original trial based on testimony at record of the

Does the record show the number of

f!R . WARSHAWs

There -- at the time of trial

7 there were — at the time of decision there were over

8

1100 people at Pennhurst and I believe several thousand

9

more on the waiting list at Pennhurst, which was how the

10 class was defined.

By waiting list at Pennhurst that

11

means people who had applied for admission to Pennhurst

12

and therefore had become eligible for other services in

13

the community.

They were all part of the class, and the

15

But once

again, T should note, and this is

the

16

next point I would

make and perhaps bestillustrates

the

17 intrusive nature of the lower court’s order and the
18

broad gap between it and the judgment of state

19 officials, and that is that it necessarily imposes upon

20 thousands of other people who might otherwise be
21

eligible for services in Pennsylvania, because the court

22 has .given absolute

priority to its order over all other

23

competing needs.

It has on

at least one occasion

24

condemned state officials for moving residents out of

25 another facility in Pennsylvania where conditions were

21

1

clearly deteriorating badly — and this was a matter of

2

record — where it was about tc lose substantial

3 funding, and said that that was unacceptable in light of
4 his orders in Pennhurst, notwithstanding the fact that
5 at that point Pennhurst, and today,
6

was fully certified

by the federal government as meeting minimum standards

7 and was receiving substantial federal funding.
The intrusive nature of the lower court's

8

9 orders it seems to me is fairly obvious.

State

10

officials must conform their conduct to those orders

11

regardless of their own professional judgments and

12

regardless of the legitimacy of competing demands for

13 limited state resources.

If they do not, they risk

14 contempt# and in this case that has been a very real
15 risk.
Less obvious are the invidious effects of the

16

17 court proceedings themselves regardless of the orders
18 which are issued.

Since the entry of judgment in 1978

19 there have been over 50 days of hearings held in the
20 district court.
21

There have been hundreds more before a

hearing master appointed by the court to decide

22 individual placement, make individual placement

23
24
25

decisions.
Each of these hearings must be attended by a
state or county official, professional who must spend

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

time educating the judge so that the judge can make

2

professional judgments, or at least explaining and

3

justifying their own judgments to the court or the

4 hearing master.

In either case the effect is that

5 limited and precious professional resources are wasted

6

for the sole purpose of allowing a court and its master

7 to substitute their own professional judgments for those
8 of qualified state officials.
This Court has found this kind of judicial

9
10

interference with professional decisionmakers to be

11

unacceptable even in cases involving constitutional

12

rights.

When that interference involves the operation

13 of a wholly state program solely for the purpose of
14

enforcing state law is a totally unacceptable exercise

15 of the federal judicial power, and we suggest this Court
16

should stop it.
Thank you.

I'd like to reserve

perspective.

This case went back to the circuit two and

6 decision in

The circuit en banc did so.

In light of the

state supreme court decision, all eight circuit justices

didn’t like the state law,

12

who thought it unwise, but nonetheless clearly the state

The

state legislative policy here, the preference for

and the state law.
The circuit below, all eight justices followed

20 settled pendant jurisdiction principles, settled since

class in this case
Sc far there is nothing extraordinary about

2

What is extraordinary is petitioners* claim

4 that principles of federalism as they understand them
5 require a new Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence and a new
6 pendant jurisdiction jurisprudence.
But on the facts of this case, the result

The settled pendant

jurisdiction doctrine is preserved, and federalism is
10

served since the state remains free to change its policy.

MB. GILHOOL*

Your Honor, I believe that is

the necessary consequence of the circuit court's

17 unanimous holding as to the clarity of state law.

We

argued the ultra veries argument last time, and I would

rest upon that and upon this Court's decision earlier in

Parsing that Younglike fiction as to when it's

23 outrageous is something of a judicial optical illusion.

MR. GILKOOLs

2
3

Well, my point. Your Honor, is,

as this Court has held in many cases, that the Congress

4 may overcome the jurisdictional limitations of the
5

Eleventh Amendment as they may not those of Article III.
My point is that in many cases this Court has

6
7

held the jurisdictional limitations of the Eleventh

8

Amendment may be waived.

9

those of Article III.

That is not so with respect tc

And, of course, there is the

10

Young fiction with respect tc the Eleventh Amendment,

11

and there is no such with respect to Article III.
Siler articulated and it itself is one of the

12
13

significant early articulations of pendant

14

jurisdiction.

15

the reasons articulated in Gibbs and its predecessors,

That — that such existed not only for

19 unnecessarily binding constitutional decisions and
20
21

orders .
Three years ago in Mayer and Gagne you

22

unanimously held that a Fourteenth — a substantial

23

Fourteenth Amendment question once in a case remains in

24

the case until the entire dispute is settled.

25

there was a substantial Fourteenth Amendment claim, and

There

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 6204300

1

the case had settled with injunctive relief on the

2

pendant Social Security Act ground.

The question was

3 whether attorneys' fees against state officials violated
4

the Eleventh Amendment.
In what the opinion of the Court and the

5

6 concurring opinion alike called the narrow ground, you
7

held unanimously that respondent alleged substantial

8

Fourteenth Amendment claims resolves the Eleventh

9

Amendment question.
The same result, as I suggested at argument

10
11

last time, obtains in Edelman.

There the Court improved

12 an injunction on pendant grounds, requiring state
13 officials to timely decide public assistance claims.
14

Edelman there was a Fourteenth Amendment claim and

15

pendant jurisdiction.

In

The injunction rested upon the

16 pendant federal statute under Hagans.

The pendant injunction here is and can be cn

17

18 no different jurisdictional basis from the pendant
19 injunction in Edelman, for this Court has never held
20

that a spending power statute such as the Social

21

Security Act in Edelman itself overrides the Eleventh

22

Amendm ent .

23

QUESTION;

Eut you knew, of course, that

24 Edelman was a federal case,

The pendant statute here is a

2

3

think the controlling matter is the presence of the

Fourteenth Amendment.

would not bar relief if it had rested in a pendant

You do.
When the state claim is

If the state statutory

22

Before I do that, I'd like to a ns wer Justice

23

Powell's earlier question regarding the n um ber of

24

plaintiff class members.

25

residents as of the time of trial, and th e evidence at

There were 1,23 0 Pennhurst

And, Justice O'Connor, the counties do have an

2

3

independent obligation to provide community services.

4

At page 28 of my brief there is a typo where I have the

5

word "no independent" rather than "an independent," and

6

I wanted to take that opportunity to correct that.
Respectful and deferential relations between

7
8

federal courts and state governments are embodied, of

9

course,

10 action

in the principle of comity.

Where federal

would leave state interests free of undue

11

interference, that action serves comity, and on the

12

other hand, where a federal court needlessly intrudes on

13

state prerogatives, nonaction or abstention serves the

14

interest of comity.
And Judge Elbersell below still adhered in his

15
16

words to the view that the least restrictive obligation

17

should not be imposed on the hospital authorities, and

18

then concluded that he and the court is bound by

19

Pennsylvania courts' interpretation of state law issues,

20

even if they adopt what to him was the disagreeable

21

least restrictive test.
While they are sometimes in tension, the two

22

23 principal themes of comity we believe are in harmony in
24

this case.

The first theme if federal judicial

25

nonintervention with state determinations, and the

39

1

second is sensitivity to the consequences of abstention.

2

The state policy is one which has been adopted

3

fully and the practices adopted fully by the federal

4 court below.

The development of individual habilitation

5

plans was not made up by the lower court, nor was the

6

process of assessment of people and placement in

7 accordance with a state’s preference for community
8

services.

All those rules, all those procedures were in

9 existence before the trial of this case began.
10

And, Justice Stevens, your hypothetical is no

11

hypothetical.

The state legislature in 1970 did decree

12

and appropriate money to remove 900 people from

13

Pennhurst, and that money, unspent, most of it, at the

14 time of the trial, was specifically for the dispersal,
15

in the words of the statute, of Pennhurst residents to

the community.

QUESTION*

Had there been any decision by the

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania prior to Schmidt that
settled state law?
HR. FERLEGER;

We believe that the statute was

12 clear before Schmidt, and there —
13

QUESTION;

Eut my question was had there been

14 a decision by your supreme court?
15

MR. FERLEGER;

There had been lower court

16 decisions but not one by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
17

QUESTION*

Not by the supreme court.

And your

18 supreme court decided Schmidt in 1981, as I recall.
19

HR. FERLEGER;

That’s correct.

There had teen

20 decisions by lower appellate courts in Pennsylvania, but
21

Schmidt was the first analysis of that issue by the

22

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

23

QUESTION;

Did Schmidt hold that the State

24

Department of Public Welfare had been acting beyond its

25

authority in all of these prior years that Pennhurst had

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

been operated?
HR. FERLEGER*

3 or decided in Schmidt.
4

QUESTION*

No.

That issue was not raised

It was not addressed at all.

Has that ever been decided by the

5 Supreme Court of Pennsylvania?
6

HR. FERLEGERs

No.

No, it hasn't.

The

7 Supreme Court of Pennsylvania — excuse me — the
8

Commonwealth Court cf Pennsylvania, a court of statewide

9 jurisdiction, has held that funding is not an issue when
10

it comes to community services.

In the In res Sauers

11

case decided after Schmidt, the Commonwealth Court held

12

that the state must pay for community services and that

13 the statute contemplates unanticipated, even unbudgeted
14 for demands on the state treasury.
15

Now, you don't have to reach that issue here,

16 of course, because as the court of appeals held -- the
17

footnote is a page and a half long — the judgment below

18 does not involve funding, does not raise any issue of
19

funding because the state funding adjustment mechanisms

20

remain in effect, and there has been no problem in all

21

these years that we've had with funding questions.

22
23

We believe that the deference that a federal
court must pay to state law makes sense in light of the

24 requirement that federal courts avoid adjudication of
25

constitutional questions whenever possible, even when

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

2

they are difficult state law questions.
What are the consequences of this approach?

3 Well, in this case as this Court recalls very well, I*m
4 sure, the federal court was faced with serious,
5 irreparable injury to many hundreds of people:
6

psychological harm, physical harm, regression,

7 abominable conditions, so abominable that even at this
8

point and in the court of appeals the petitioners don’t

9 ask this Court to leave them free to run Pennhurst and
10

11
12

to injure people as they were doing previously.
In the court of appeals they told the court of
appeals we're not talking at all about the part of the

13 order that relates to the operation of Pennhurst.
14

Even Younger v. Harris, which enunciated the

15 principles embodied in our federalism, made it clear
16

that irreparable injury is a reason for a federal court

17 not to stay its equitable hand.
18

The seven-year delay in raising the comity .

19 issue points to the second consequence that’s considered
20

by federal courts in evaluating abstention comity

21

application, and that is, the delay and expense that

22 would be caused.

If this Court determines that the

23

court of appeals was wrong in following state law after

24

the remand, we will be back in the court of appeals for

25 a constitutional decision.

If this Court determines

44

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that somehow Judge Broderick was wrong in deciding the

2

constitutional issues or any issue back in the early

3

1970s and late 1970s, we will be in state court for many

4

more years of litigation, and people will remain at

5

Pennhurst and continue to have their state and federal

6

rights violated.

7

QUESTION;

You could have started out in state

8

court and obtained an adjudication of all the rights of

9

which you seek to adjudicate here.

10
11

MR. FEELEGERs

We could have, Your Honor, and

the federal law does net require people raising federal

12 claims to start out in state court.
13

QUESTION;

I realize that, but you were

14 complaining about the delay.
15
16

Perhaps you would have had

less delay if you’d have gone into state court.
MR. FEELEGERs

Well, in Davis v. Gray in 1872,

17

the Court pointed to the local influences which

18

sometimes disturb the even flow of justice as one reason

19

for people having the option of going to federal court.

AU3ERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

regarding the Pennhurst institution itself.

According

2 to plans filed by the state just this past Friday,
3 within
4

a year and a half there will only be about 200

people left at Pennhurst, and it’s no secret that like

5 King Nebuchadnezzar I think we see the handwriting on
6

the wall.

7 trial,

And Pennhurst, as the lower court was told at

will be closed.

There is no dispute that the

8 relief chosen and selected by the state for the problems
9 at Pennhurst is the replacement of Pennhurst with
10 community services.

The delay and expense at this point, having

11

12 been sent back to the court of appeals for the state law

13

decision by this Court, means that there will be more

14

difficulties for the plaintiff class members and a waste

15 of federal and state court energy if the state courts
16

must become involved.
Comity considerations apply in civil rights

17

18 cases, of course, but they counsel against abstention.
19

As the Court in Fair Assessment noted and in Kayer v.

20 Educational Equality League said,
21

"There is substantial

authority for the preposition that abstention is net

22 favored in an equal protection civil rights case brought
23

under

24
25 courts

1983 and 28 U.S.C. 1343.”
We believe that it makes sense that federal
in civil rights cases should use state law

46

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

remedies.

Nothing could interfere with state

2

determinations less, and nothing could serve both

3 Pennhurst residents and our federalism more.
It is no blow to comity or federalism where

4

5 the result in the federal court is the same as that
6 decreed by the legislature, by the state courts and by
7

the state executive.
The rule is not a new one.

8

In fact, in

9

preparing I noticed the case Clark v. Smith, 38 United

10

States Courts 195, where the court said, and it is the

11

rule today, that if the remedy in state court is

12

substantially consistent with the chancery side cf the

13 federal court, with those remedies, no reason exists why
14 it shouldn't be pursued in the same form as it is in the
15

state courts.
Justice Brandeis in Dawson, ether courts since

16
17

then,

1968, Stern v. Chester Tube, have reiterated that

18
19

QUESTION!

Wasn’t that a Fourteenth Amendment

20 case?
21

ME. FEELEGEE:

Excuse me?

The Clark v. Smith

22 involved relief under state law, and it wasn't a
23 Fourteenth Amendment case.

It involved rights to land

24 in Kentucky in Clark v. Smith.
25

QUESTION:

I have a hard -- I have a hard time

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

understanding how that applies to this case.
HR. FERLEGERi

2
3

Well, it applies because in

this case the Court doesn't need to decide the

4 Fourteenth Amendment question, the Fourteenth Amendment
5 question being substantial.
6

Having defined and

recognized the state law right, the Court has to decide

7 what remedy should be applied.
8 remedy

And the remedy here is a

that is accepted in state law.

9 remedy in state law.

It is the typical

At the time of the last argument

10

here, 20 courts of common pleas in Pennsylvania had

11

ordered community services created for individuals.
It is no news to Pennsylvania officials that

12

13

courts can require the development of services for

14 people.

What Schmidt decided, although the Supreme

15

Court of Pennsylvania had not said it before, was

16

perfectly consistent with everything that had happened

17 in the lower courts.
18

Comity, in fact, would be repudiated if a

19 federal court was required to follow state law for the
20

basis of its decision but then was forbidden to use

21

state law remedies in order to execute that decision.

22

In conclusion, may It please the Court,

23

community services for people with retardation are older

24

than institutions.

The district court noted in its

25 opinion that specialized services for the retarded began

48

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

not as institutions but as small, short-term community

2

facilities.

Pennhurst grew from the corruption of that

3 origin .
4

Pennsylvania no dcubt will close Pennhurst

5 like it's already closed, the record shows,
6

post-judgment, three other institutions for the retarded

7 in Pennsylvania no matter what this Court decides.
8

Eut

that is as it should be, because a federal court's

9 preferences for a particular result should bow and have
10

to bow, as in this case to the social judgment and

11

decisions and determinations of the state courts and the

12

state legislatures.

Such deference is the demand both

13 of federalism and the right of my clients, the few
14

people remaining at Pennhurst, and those who have left

15 Pennhurst and are blossoming in the community.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTON FARR, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL

MR. FERLEGEEs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

t

As I understand his argument, all that a

2

plaintiff needs to do in order to bring the state into

3

federal court under state law and obtain whatever

4

injunctive relief it wants is to plead a not wholly

5

insubstantial Fourteenth Amendment claim.
Now, this Court recently in Aldinger and Cwen

6

7 Equipment has made clear —

QUESTION;

8
9

against state officers.
MR. FARR;

10
11

A Fourteenth Amendment claim

Against state officers.

They have

to characterize it as against state officers.
The Court in Aldinger and Owen Equipment has

12

13 made clear, however, that the Article III inquiry is not
14

the full extent of an inquiry into federal

15

jurisdiction.

And the Court in Owen Fquipment said

16 quite plainly the limits upon federal jurisdiction,
17

whether imposed by the Constitution or by Congress, must

18

be neither disregarded nor evaded.
Now, in Edelman that is exactly what the Court

19
20

did.

In Edelman there was a not wholly insubstantial

21

Fourteenth Amendment claim, just as Mr. Gilhool says

22

there is here.

23

the Eleventh Amendment was overridden.

24

look at pendant claims and in fact determined that a

25

pendant claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.

However, the Court did not then say that
It went on tc

50

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And

1

that's precisely the correct level of analysis to apply

2

in this case.

3

This claim is a claim against the state.

It

4 is not a federal claim within the doctrine of Ex parte
5

Young,

and it is barred by the Eleventh Amendment,

6

whether as a pendant claim or not.

7

The other point --

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Furthermore, in the same argument about the

5

Eleventh Amendment counsel suggested that the Court has

6 never held that a federal statute can override the
7 Eleventh Amendment as applied by Ex parte Young.

But I

8 think if the Court will look at Bay v. Atlantic

what the Court did.

2

claim.

That was not a Fourteenth Amendment

It was an issue whether certain federal statutes

22 could be enforced against state officials under the
23 supremacy clause.
24

QUESTIONS

That is permitted by Ex parte Young.
Would you — would you expand on

25 that for just a moment, because the theory of Ex parte

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-8300

1

Young,

I understand, is when there's unconstitutional

2 conduct that's sort of ultra veries.
3

that way.
You say the same thing about a federal statute

4
5

They cannot act

when there's an allegation of a violation of a federal

6 statute, that that's like an allegation that the
7 official act is beyond his state authority?

MR. FARE*

8
9

Well, what I understand Ex parte

Young to say — and, of course, exactly what the fiction

10

is has been a subject of some substantial debate — but

11

what I understand it to say is that where a state

12 official comes in conflict with the superior authority

13 of federal law, then the Eleventh Amendment cannot
14

confer on him an immunity from obedience to that supreme

15

law.

And that would be true under the supremacy clause,

16 or it would be true under the Fourteenth Amendment.
17

QUESTION*

Well, but if you're applying a

18 federal statutory claim, that would mean that to
19

determine whether or not the Eleventh Amendment defense

20

is a good defense, you'd have to decide the merits of

21

the federal statutory claim, is that right?

22

23

MR. FARR*

In a situation of Ex parte Young,

of course, that's the situation you have on a federal

24 constitutional claim as well.
25

If you have a Fourteenth

Amendment claim against a state official, the court has

52

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

to look at the claim itself to determine whether he is

2 stripped of his conduct.
3

if you

So that's an inevitable result

were going to have federal law be supreme in

4 federal courts against state officials, if you want to
5 enforce the federal law.
6

where you're dealing solely with state law, that is not

7 necessary.
8

9

But when you have a situation

The state courts are fully available to

provide the relief there.
QUESTION*

But then the question, as I

10 understand you here, the question for the federal court
11

is whether there was any authority whatsoever for what

12

the state official was —

13

ME. FARR*

That -- that is the question.

As I

14 indicated earlier, I think that is the question that
15 comes out of cases such as Treasure Salvors.

And as I

16 said to Justice White, I think that is an inquiry,
17 though, that has to be very carefully limited, because
18 you're really trying to —
19

QUESTION:

But it's an inquiry that requires

20 some examination of state law to decide whether there is
21
22

any state law authority —
MR. FARR:

That's right.

I believe a very

23 threshold —
24

QUESTION:

So you don’t deny the duty of the

25 federal court to at least take a peek at state law.

NR. FARR:

I think the federal court has to

doing something more than that by saying that he works

5

for the state when he’s doing what he's doing.
