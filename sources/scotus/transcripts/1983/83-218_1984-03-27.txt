2

this matter that might provide the Court some assistance

3

in determining whether this rather curscry reference

an issue is presented in a state court, a fact situation

theory, that's not viewed as an exhaustion cf a -- cf a

separate legal theory.

10

And when

Therefore, tc the extent this Court may feel

11

that the North Carolina Supreme Court to some extent

12

waived its procedural default rule, I would argue that

13

the most they were looking for — andit was on their own

14

initiative -- would be somewhat of a plain error

approach; that it was net a complete waiver of the

state's forfeiture rule.

18

the courts recognized underline the recogition of

19

procedural defaults over in the habeas corpus proceeding

recognized and followed its own rule, and that would be

the large extent in this case.

At most it would be sort of a

If it continues, of course, and it's

However, Mr. Ross

10

would probably get the benefit of any change in that

regard .

12

15A-1419, a new pcst-conviction relief

13

statute, now called Motion for Appropriate Relief in our

14

basis for reopening a prior post-conviction proceeding.

However, that's only in the instance that the issue is

17

ruled on on the merits in the prior proceeding.

have here; that is, where a decision was made on

procedural grounds.

21

It's

Mr. Nakell filed a number of cases last week

22

with you-all in support of this position, as I

23

understand it, and I think it's important to consider

24

there that what the Supreme Court was doing was waiving

25

its procedural defaults again in the direct appeal

context where the court had an opportunity to deal with

2

the issues presented at that time, and not waiving them

11

MR. LEAGUE;

14

Apparently on request, at least

15

in these cases — and I believe there were five of them

16

that fit that mold -- the lawyer says I cannot find

17

anything wrong with this -- with this appeal; I am

18

abandoning my assignment of error; would you please look

19

it ever?

20

And they have done so.
QUESTION;

So you think it might — you think

21

the case might come out differently if he had raised his

22

objection below and preserved it and presented it to the

23

Supreme Court of the state?

24
25

MR. LEAGUE;

Well, he wouldn’t have had to

raise it below under the law at the time of the trial.

1

He would have since 1981 if it had been tried then.

2

don't think the case would come out differently or

3

should come cut differently in this Court, Your Honor.

4

Going back to my argument a little bit earlier about if

5

the waiver was only to a certain degree by the State

6

Supreme Court -- that is, dealing with plain error,

7

presumably under state law — then certainly I would

8

argue tc you that the interest in comity dictates that

9

the federal courts go no further.

Well, of course, the cause in

prejudice is beside the point if there hasn't been any

13

ME. LEAGUE;

Ch, I understand.

Yes, sir.

It

14

assumes that we've got a forfeiture in the first place.

15

Going on to the next hurdle we must get ever,

16

and that's whether Wainwright v. Sykes applies in the

17

appellate context at all.

18

at faults, I certainly urge you to go ahead and adept

19

that course, if you would.

20

since that dealt with trial

The majority of the circuits have done that.

21

The interests that Wainwright v. Sykes serves, of

22

course, are not quite as strong in the appellate context

23

as they are in the trial context, because you don't

24

avoid retrial.

25

strength, though.

That's not to say they're not without

I would certainly argue to you that they are,

2

as much as you want to make the trial the decisive and

3

portentous event with regard to the criminal procedure.

4

With regard to things that you can talk about there,

5

certainly it seems to me that you want to make the

6

appeal the decisive and portentous event with regard to

7

matters of record that you can go ahead and correct

8

there.
The interests in finality and accuracy are

9

10

similarly enhanced because of the difference in

11

timeliness you have on appeal as a practical matter and

12

as you have with regard to post-conviction or collateral

3

attack .
In this particular case I believe the appeal

4

was resolved some eight months after the trial, whereas

6

the post-convietion proceedings, as you know, are new in

their twelfth year.

and may it please the Court:
I would like to pick up on the novelty

2
3

question that was just beginning to be addressed here.
In the Court's decision in Hankerscn applying

4

5

the Mullaney decision retroactively, the Court noted

6

that in many cases the defendants might well net have

7

raised

8

the courts -- or that the states may well be able to

9

protect those convictions from collateral attack or

the particular objection involved there, and that

10

other attack by enforcing what the court referred to as

11

the normal and valid rule under which a claim is

12

foregone if there is not an objection, contemporaneous

13

objection to the rule.

14

And in Engle v. Isaac the Court addressed an

15

aspect of that question.

There had been no objection

16

raised to the instruction in Engle v.

17

prior to the Hankerson decision.

18

that under prevailing law at the time it would have been

19

futile to raise such an objection, and the Court

20

emphatically rejected that suggestion that futility,

21

perceived futility in the state court was -- would le an

22

adequate ground or cause for forgiving the procedural

23

default in the state court.

24

that the allegation that the claim was novel was net

25

sufficient in that particular case because the

Isaac.

This was

And a claim was made

And the Court also noted

20

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

defendants there had been tried after this Court's

2

decision in In re Winship, which held that the due

3

process clause requires prccf beyond a reasonable doubt

4

in criminal cases.

5

The effect of the Court's ruling there was to

6

limit cr to prohibit, in effect, the retroactive

7

application of Mullaney to the most recent cases to that

8

decision, those in the later years; but it reserved the

9

question of whether a claim that was truly novel, one

10

that would have required extraordinary vision, would

11

constitute cause for excusing the procedural default.

12

Now,

if this Court were to adopt that

13

position, it would have the ironic effect net of

14

preserving convictions that were most recent at a time

15

when the rule itself was being questioned and yet

16

setting aside convictions that were the oldest at a time

17

when, by hypothesis, the right was not recognized and

18

that the trial procedure was uniformly recognized as

19

being fair.

20

The Court recognized in Engle v. Issac that

21

the purpose of habeas corpus is to set aside a

22

conviction where there is fundamentally unfair

23

incarceration.

24

Isaac where the issue is beginning to be litigated there

25

was not fundamentally unfair incarceration, then it

And we would submit that if in Engle v.

21

follows a fortiori here that there was not, if the

2

suggestion is that the claim is not novel.
But, in fact, the claim cculd hardly be

3
4

described as novel in the years prior to In re Winship.

5

In In re Kinship itself, the issue in the New York Court

6

of Appeals was not the rule of proof beyond a reasonable

7

doubt in a criminal prosecution* the rule was simply —

8

the question was simply whether that rule should apply

9

in juvenile proceedings.

Ahd this Court's — this

10

Court's decision in Patterson stated that long before In

11

re Winship, the universal rule in this country was that

12

the prosecution bears the burden of proof beyond a

13

reasonable doubt.
In fact, in

14

1968 before this Court's decision

15

in Winship and before the Respondent's trial in this

16

case,

17

18

imposing the burden of proof on the defendant for an

19

alibi defense violated due process.

21

banc decision of the Eighth Circuit, also before

22

Respondent's trial in this case, that struck down a

23

similar instruction under the due process clause.

24

the Eighth Circuit had regarded the presumption of

25

innocence and the corresponding rule of proof beyond a

this Court had granted certiorari in Johnson v.

And

that there

2

was no real question of retroactivity in that case at

3

all.

4

And finally, there were a substantial body of

self-defense was on the prosecution rather than on the

question of the burden of proof under the due process

informed of his right to appeal in some fashion, that —

that — either by the lawyer or by the court or was

unaware of it, in those circumstances that might be true.
But where — where you’re including an

argument on appeal, as this Court recognized last term

in Jones v. Barnes, the lawyer has to make difficult

judgments as tc what arguments to raise on appeal and

what arguments not to raise on appeal once the defendant

has made the fundamental right to go ahead.
So if by hypothesis this right was so novel

that no one was litigating it at the time, then the

lawyer cculd hardly be faulted for not including the

right on appeal.

upheld

proof and not only beyond a preponderance -- by a

preponderance of the evidence, but indeed, the burden of

beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Court upheld that.

constitutionality of presumptions that could have teen
