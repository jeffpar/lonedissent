OPAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN K. CHRISTOPHER, ESQ.,

8

CN EEHAIF OF THE PETITIONEE
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court.
The fundamental issue before you is whether

12

California obtained from the United States a public

13

trust property interest in Mexican rancho lands which

14

are now held by private parties under an unqualified

15

federa1 patent.

16

By a divided vote, the California Supreme

17

Court held that upon its admission to the union,

18

California obtained a public trust property interest.

1

The California Supreme Court recognized that never

20

before in mere than

21

the union had this public trust concept been extended to

22

Mexican rancho lands, cr indeed to any ether lands tc

23

which California had never previously had title.

24
25

13C years since California entered

The theory of the California Supreme Ccurt was
that Mexico retained a public trust interest when it

1

conveyed this land into private ownership in 1839, that

2

the Uni ted States acquired this interest when it annexed

3

California in 1848, and that California succeeded tc the

4

interest under the equal footing doctrine when it

6

entered the union in 1850.

6

Now, this public trust interest carved cut by

7

California is a permanent and pervasive estate in land.

8

For example, it is sc pervasive that the state can enter

9

upcn and possess the land.

It enables the state tc

10

construct improvements on the property or, cn the ether

11

hand,

12

without compensation.

tc require that the property be held as open space

QUESTION;

13

Mr. Christopher, is that a holding

15

are quoting from or one of the California appellate

16

courts ?

The reason

The rule of these cases is net directly

16

challenged here, but it is indirectly subverted through

17

the ca rving out of this very extensive public trust

19

the Court is whether the Court will permit and authorize

20

the erosion of private rights by denying the owner the

21

most fundamental aspects of ownership under the

22

California Supreme Court public trust doctrine.

23

The question before

In a fundamental sense, this case turns on the

24

meaning of the Act of March 3,

25

the Mexican Claims Act.

1851, which is known as

This Act was the mechanism to

cany cut the commitment cf the United States under the

2

Treaty of Guadeloupe Kidalgc, which of course as ycu

3

knew ended the war between the United States and

4

Mexico .

5

To heal the wounds of that war, the United

6

States made a commitment that the property rights cf

7

former Mexican citizens would be inviolably respected,

8

inviolably respected.

The title to the 1851 Act sends

9

an important message.

The title is An Act to Ascertain

10

and Settle Private land Claims in California.

11

purpose of the Act was to determine once and for all the

12

validity and scope cf land claims in California, to

13

issue patents to these that preved their claims, and to

14

identify the remainder as public domain.

don't in your brief argue the point that the government

does in the first point of their brief about what

5

happened with the actual original conveyance.

conveyance, contrary to the government's position, what

8

is your view as to the status cf the title to the trust

WH. CHRISTOPHER;

Well, my view of that is

12

that at that time,

will take your assumption for the moment, Mr. Justice

14

Stevens, that such a right did exist.

15

power of the Beard cf land Commissioners under the 1651

16

Act to determine questions exactly like that.

17

that issue was an unsettled issue.

It was within the

The Board cf land Commissioners was set up to

18

separate the public domain from private property, and in

19

accordance with that jurisdiction, the Eoard cf lard

20

Commissioners passed on such questions as whether or not

21

there was such a right under Mexican law.

22

land commissioners were specifically chosen for their

23

knowledge of Mexican law.

Sc, until the Act cf

to determine these rights, that question was an

1

uncertain question, but it was well within the power of

2

the Board of Land Commissioners under the 1851 Act tc

3

resolve exactly that kind of a question.
QUESTION:

4

I don't think that answers my

5

question, Mr. Christopher.

6

was answered, that the correct answer would have been

7

that it was something ether than what happened in 1851.

8

You are saying that the activity pursuant to the 1851

9

statute conveyed that interest regardless of what its

10

status

I am assuming that before it

was before, as I understand it.
You say that even though that would have

11
12

enlarged the rights of your clients.

13

MB. CHRISTOPKEBj

Mr. Justice Stevens, on your

14

question, I would say that after California entered the

15

union,

your assumption that such a right did exist --

Act proceedings, and taking

QUESTION;

Right.

18

MR. CHRISTCPEFR:

— then that right may have

19

passed

20

although there is a subsidiary question there, and that

21

is whether or not the equal footing clause covered such

22

partial rights, a question also addressed in the brief.

23

to California under the equal footing clause,

QUESTION:

Mr. Christopher, I am interested in

24

just hew this is a federal question.

Supposing this

25

happened, that your client had a confirmed patent from

8

1

the Mexican land grant that had been authorized by the

2

Claims Commission, and so fcrth, and adjoining ycur

3

client's property was another property which didn't come

4

under the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo, and there was

5

just a classic surveying dispute, say, as to 20 feet of

6

their property.
The Mexican patent shewed that ycur client

7
8

owned it.

The deed under the authority of the state of

9

California showed that the ether people owned it.

Pnd

10

that is litigated in the California courts, and the

11

California Supreme Court applies its rule as to hew you

12

solve these surveying ambiguity disputes, and rules

13

against your client, saying that the Mexican patent

14

description doesn't prevail.

15

Do you think your client could come here cn

16

the grounds that it is a federal question because the

17

full latitude cf the description in the confirmed

18

Mexican patent wasn't confirmed by the Supreme Court of

19

California ?
MR. CHRISTCPHERi

20

I think that is a much

21

different case than the case here, Mr. Justice

22

Rehnquist.

23

this Court is whether the state of California received

24

anything pursuant to the equal footing clause when

25

California entered the union.

this property interest passed from Mexico tc the

Cne of the things that is clearest under this,

6
7

Court's decisions is that what a state initially

8

receives under the equal footing clause is a federal

9

question.

The decision of this Court in what I call the

10

Humboldt Light Case, California Land Commission, Justice

11

White’s opinion in a footnote, I think, says

12

specifically that what a state received initially under

13

the equal footing clause is a federal question.

14

Now, there are other possible federal

15

questions, but I think there can be no doubt at all as

16

tc whether that is a federal question.

17

federal quesitcns relate tc the Treaty of Guadalcupe

18

Hidalgo and the construction of the 1P51 Act, but on

19

that question I think there is no doubt.

QUESTION :

Can this case be decided without

passing on the treaty problems that you mentioned?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

24

Act is the crucial basis for decision here.

25

2

important background for both the 1851 Act and for this

3

Court’s ruling in earlier cases that Mexican ranches are

4

in a special category, and that the state does not

5

receive tidelands in Mexican ranches when it entered the

6

union.

QUESTION;

The treaty questions are only

Mr. Christopher, don’t we have to

decide the treaty questions in this case?
ME. CHRISTOPHER:

Well, you certainly have to

10

decide that the treaty was entitled -- the treaty was

11

intended to protect the rights of Mexicans --

12

QUESTION*

13

isn’t that a federal auesicn?

14
15
16

Well, new, that very question,

MR. CHRISTOPHER*

Yes, I believe that’s a

federal question as well, Your Honor.
QUESTION*

Mr. Christopher, let me fellow

17

through a little on Justice Fehnquist's inquiry.

18

prevail here, are we net constructing, what shall I call

1

it, a Mason-Dixcn line between — in the southern part

20

of California with these old Mexican grants, and in the

21

northern part where there are no Mexican grants, with

22

different rules of law flowing from each?

23

MR. CHRISTOPHER*

If you

Mr. Justice Plackmun , I know

24

the California Supreme Court took that position.

The

25

land titles in California vary all up and down the coast

with respect tc these tidelands that the state cwns

clause.

4

ownership.

5

So there are many categories of tidelands or shorelands

6

in California.

7
8

Many cf those have been granted into private
Many cf them are held in public ownership.

I think that is a much overstated worry on the
part of the California Supreme Court.

Frankly, there is

a checkerboarding cf title all up and down the coast,
10

and the fact that it has been settled for

11

Mexican land grants are in a special category, I think,

12

would indicate that it would lend stability rather than

13

promote instability for the Court tc vindicate my

position here today.

MB. CHBISTCPHEE:

Mr. Justice Powell, the

California public trust doctrine is so ambitious that it

has been extended tc land or the shores of lakes in

CN BEHALF CF U.S. AS AMICUS CURIAE

14
15

MR. CLAIBCRNE:

Mr. Chief Justice , and may it

please the Court.

16

One could, of course, debate the wisdom,

17

indeed, even the correctness of the rule exempting

18

Mexican land grants from the equal footing principle

19

that the state is the owner of at least navigable water

20

bottoms and tidal lands, but on this question, the law

21

has been settled so well so long ago that to engage in

22

such an exercise teday with respect to a rule cf

23

property would seem out of bounds and cut of date.

24
25

On the other hand, the state cucht net be
permitted to attempt to circumvent that settled,

3

reserved for itself all the uses and full control of

4

those water bottoms.
But in our view, this is uniquely a case ruled

5
6

by authority, indeed, by two decisions of this Court.

7

Those are, in cur view, the Ccrcnadc Beach case,

8

reported in Volume 255 of this Court's decision, and the

9

Title Insurance Company case, reported ten volumes later

10

at 265 B.S., both cases cited in all briefs.
Those are two unanimous decisions, the first

11
12

one by Hr. Justice Heines, the second by hr. Justice Van

13

de Vanter, bringing, as this Ccurt has remarked in later

14

days,

Now, obviously, that is all the more true now,

60 years later.

Touching these cases briefly, the first

9

one, the Coronado Peach Company case, that was a case in

10

which the United States brought a condemnation action

11

with respect to an island in San Diego Eay which was the

12

subject -- which had been the subject of a Mexican

13

grant.

14

embraced some 600 acres of water bottoms on one side,

15

both submerged and tidelands.

The question was whether the grant of the island

We then in 1921 elaborately argued that the

tidelands could not have passed to the grantee because

20

water bottoms as part of the grant, had no jurisdiction

been thought open, tut interestingly, the United States

made an alternative argument in that case, and it vas

that even if bare title had passed to the Mexican

grantee, the United States did not -- was net required

6

to pay full value for these water bottoms in this

condemnation action because there were reserved public

equality of title that is higher than Mexico granted to

7

his predecessors in interest, and more than the United

8

States confirmed in carrying cut its obligations under

9

the Treaty of Guadalcupe Hidalgo, but in order to obtain

10

this result, petitioner is going to have tc convince

this Court tc give it special treatment, because the

federal question presented here?

17

MS. SAGGESE:

Well, Your Honcr, there are

18

four possible bases for a federal question, as Summa has

The Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo

20

is a possible basis.

However, we dc net challenge the

validity of the treaty and we don’t think that it

On the 1851

Act, if we take your adversary's position, I understand

them tc be arguing that that may have enlarged the title

federal question as to whether the federal patent could

16

conveyed.

17

Wouldn’t that be a federal question?

that’s the argument.

Cne of

21

the arguments is that it did grant more.

Even if the

22

Mexican grant did net include the trust reservation, as

23

I understand their position, although the government is

24

a little ambiguous in its brief, they in effect argue

25

that there was an enlargement cf the grant.

MS. SAGGESE:

Well, Your Honor, once again,

10

we would point to those cases that say that when a

11

confirmatory patent is at issue, in order tc determine

12

what the Mexican grantees get, that is, whether what

13

they get confirmed was what Mexicc had granted their cr

14

whether it enlarged -- the United States cculd have

15

enlarged those rights as it could have.

16

States was free to grant any of its proprietary rights

17

to Mexican grantees and thereby enlarge these rights,

18

but we would say that again it is a local question tc

20

what the grantee ended up with as a result of the

21

confirmatory grant.

law interpreted at trial to mean a reservation in favor

17

of the public, that it would include the public’s rights

18

in tidelands, and California, courts have also

19

interpreted this language, servitude in the context of a

20

Mexican ranch grant, tc be a reservation in favor cf the

21

public, and this Court’s holding in Earker versus Harvey

22

is not tc the contrary, because in that case this Court

23

only found that an Indian private right of occupancy was

24

not a servitude, but that is consistent with the

25

California courts’ determination that only public rights

34

were servitudes under Mexican law.

The Indian right,

2

being a private right, cculd net have teen a servitude.
In the Ccrcnado Eeach Company case, the

3
4

Solicitor General has talked to this Court at length

5

about what was contained in the briefs for the United

6

States.

7

what was on review to the Court by the United States

8

other than what is contained in the official reports.

9

There is an excerpt of the United States’ argument there

I didn’t have access to them.

I don’t knew

10

in which the United States clearly acknowledges the

11

existence of the public trust.

12

In fact, the attorney for the Coronado Beach

13

Company also says the public rights fer navigation and

14

fishery are not in issue here.

15

case of whether the United States was geing to have to

16

pay for this land.

17

shouldn’t have to lecause under Mexican law there was a

18

servitude -- this language, without prejudice tc the

19

servitudes existed in that grant as well -- and that the

20

servitude for military occupation would allow it tc he

22

Sc this was strictly a

It argued. Number Cne, that it

But this Ccurt locked at servitude in that

23

grant and determined that there was no such servitude

24

under Mexican law, that the military right of occupancy

25

could not exist under Mexican law on private property,

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

and where it could exist, the Mexican government would

2

have tc pay compensation, sc therefore there was no

3

servitude under Mexican law that would get the United

4

States cut from having to pay compensation.
The only other question that the Court

5
6

addressed in its opinion is whether fee title to tide

7

and submerged lands would have passed in the

8

confirmatory patent in that case, and it said, it

9

acknowledged that tidelands are usually held by the

10

state,

11

recognized preexisting titles, and since Mexico had the

12

ability tc convey these lands,

13

encompassed within a confirmatory patent,

14

we could do was recognize them.

15

but said that since we bad the obligation tc

that if they were
the only thing

The state's title was held in abeyance until

16

they were finally located, and if it was found to

17

include tide and submerged lands, that title related

18

back tc the original grant, which said

19

had any interest in it as far as the fee is concerned,

20

but we say that since the sovereign retained the public

21

rights, those public rights then came to California on

22

its admission tc the union.

23

Yes.

11

QUESTION;

Could I ask you, I take it that

12

under the California public trust doctrine, the state

13

could actually take possession of the property and

14

develop it?

15
16
17
18

MS. SAGGESE;

The state would have the richt.

This retained public trust interest could be exercised.
QUESTION;

Well, it could take possession and

develop it.

19

MS. SAGGESE;

20

QUESTION;

That's right.

Do you think that was true of the

21

reserved right which you claimed existed in favor cf the

22

sovereign in Mexico and under Mexican law?

23

MS. SAGGESE;

I don’t knew, Your Honor, tut

24

we do knew that it was very — they were both couched in

25

the same terms.

That is, public rights for navigation

37

1

and fishing, and in fact the Mexican public trust might

2

have even been broader because, as was stated in the

3

Apola Jacola case, it recognized public rights for

4

recreation as well, which the California courts have

5

only recently recognized.

6

But I think, Your Honor, that you have tc

7

compare the Mexican public trust and the common law

8

state public trust at the time of 1848 when the Mexican

9

sovereign would have relinquished it, and

1850, when the

10

state would have succeeded tc it, and it is only at that

11

time that a comparison is valid.

law is irrelevant, and the interests wculd be defined by

the California common law.

QUESTION:

But if they get the permission in

the first place, that determination is made by the

ME. CHRISTCFEEP:

5

That determin ation is made

by the State Lands Ccmirissicn, tut after a rather

exhaustive proceeding, and as you understand, Kr.

8

Justice, the State Lands Commission could insist that

9

the property be kept in open space without the payirert

10

of compensation if you were to uphold this public

11

trust.
With respect to the provision of the grant

12
13

relating to traversing roads, I think I should say

14

before

15

Mexican grant, but it does not appear in the 1873 patent

16

from the United States to petitioner’s predecessors.

17

Once again,

18

Land Commissioners were fully competent to pass cn.

19

fact that it does not appear in the patent, I think,

should be decisive here in addition to the fact that

this Court has never held that language preserved sc

22

broad and pervasive and permanent a trust -- cr a
