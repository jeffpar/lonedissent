Hr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
This is an appeal from a decision holding that

10
11

Section 10905 of the Interstate Commerce Act preempts

12

Hinneseta condemnaticn law when that law is applied to

13

property which has been abandoned with ICC approval

14

after the ICC has relinquished all jurisdiction and

15

inrerest in that line and where a statutorily authorized

16

Minnesota public service corporation seeks to take that

17

line by eminent domain in order to restore rail service

18

to a rural Minnesota community.
QUESTION:

in the case?

Counsel, just what is now at issue

The rails are gone, aren't they?

ME. ABDAIIAN:

21

That's correct.

There's still

land and right of way to take, Justice Blackmun, and

there's also a bond at issue.

The legal issue tefore this Court has beer

well defined by the Court of Areals.

The factual

5

context in which this case conies to this Court is

6

unccir. plicated.
CNW, the Appellee, applied to abandon a line

7
8

of rail that ran from Iowa to Minnesota.

line is the

Tart of that

19.2 mile segment that lies totally within

10

Minnesota, which has been referred to in all briefs as

11

the Hayfield segment.
The abandonment was contested by a shippers

12
13

group.

The challenge to the abandonment was

14

unsuccessful.

15

shippers group in a way that the line could avoid

16

abandonment through a procedure within the Commerce Act

17

The abandonment also was challenged by a

withdrew their offer of subsidy and the shippers group

Several months later the

Upon the founding of the Hayfield Northern,

6

the Hayfield Northern immediately sought a temporary

7

restraining order in state court in order to keep the

8

line intact, as the Appellee had already commenced

9

procedures to dismantle the track.

10
11

The TFC was granted

by the state court after a hearing.
The CNW then removed this case to federal

12

district court.

13

the action with prejudice and dissolved the injunction.

14

An appeal was immediately taken to the Eighth Circuit

15

Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals stayed the

16

order of the district court upon the posting of a bend.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court.

The Commerce Commission itself has held

repeatedly in public rulings that once the certificate

cf abandonment has issued that is the end of federal

interest, and that questions of title to and and

22

disposition cf rail property are a matter of state

23

power, a matter of the reserved powers cf the states.

24

The decision of the Court of Appeals has thus changed

The Court of Appeals found that the very tight

time constraints in this transfer to subsidy pursuant tc

QUESTION*

Did your client make any effcrt to

buy the property from the carrier?

3

ME. APDAIIAS:

He, net at all.

There was a

4

shippers group, a shippers group that opposed the

5

abandonment for substantive reasons, and then there was

6

a shippers group that sought tc have the line avoid

7

abandonment through the vehicle of running the railroad

on a subsidized basis.

Suppose as part of the balance that

you spoke cf that the Commission arrives at it was

ME. ABDAIIAN*

If the Interstate Commerce

18

Commission conditioned the abandonment on the CNW's

19

taking its rail lines and taking it from Hayfield

20

someplace else because interstate commerce interests

21

required that, that would be a different case.

A subsequent state condemnation proceeding to

initiate new service pursuant to a fresh ICC certificate

of public convenience and necessity would net interfere

property in the state that is subject to the traditional

11

Now, the railroad makes an argument in its

12
13

brief

based on so-called opportunity costs.

In an

14

abandonment proceeding, one of the factors considered by

15

the ICC is that federal service requirements keep a

16

railroad from using its resources in ether mere

17

profitable ways.

18

less is the opportunity cost that the railroad incurs ir

This relative economic disadvantage or

Appellee contends that a state’s

condemnation, restricts the railroad’s reuse if its

However,

the ICC * s abandonment approval only-

3

determined that, in balancing the competing

considerations for and against abandonment under the

public convenience and necessity, the need for this

service did not justify the costs, including the

opportunity costs that such service would impose or the

QUESTION*

Hew long do these eppertunity costs

NR. LEVY;

11

I believe that the Commission's

12

determination is essentially retrospective or

13

ccntemperaneous.

14

requirements are presently keeping the railroad from

15

using its assets in more productive ways.

This determination that local service needs do not

What I'm trying to get is your

position, is that, having cone into the ICC and gotten

an evaluation under the ICC procedures under the

satisfied,

they didn’t appeal it, is that right?

HS. KEATING;

QUESTION:

Yes, Ycur Honor.

And are you saying, in consequence,

16

having taken advantage of the federal procedure, they

17

are somehow estopped, tarred somehow, from going into

state court?
MS. KEATING:

19

We believe it would be a

collateral attack against that final order cf the

Commission that set the valuation of the line at $1.7

QUESTION;

And the ICC comes along and says,

that any forced sale or acauisiticn of a rail line, an

Mayfield Northern obtained the temporary restraining

The ICC,

we believe, cannot abdicate its rcle

5

as a guardianship ever the railroads* financial

6

condition, and I think it's important to note the

7

primary purposes behind the Staggers Rail Act, which

8

provided for Section 1C905, and that was tc deregulate

9

the railroad industry and tc provide lesser regulatory

10

restraints, but also tc give the railroad an opportunity

11

to have the earnings, adequate earnings so that it could

12

restore and maintain its rail system and thus provide

13

tetter rail service for the nation; and then finally, tc

14

provide for stability in the rail system of the nation.

15

And Section 1090E as a result was a balancing

16

test tc provide this means by which within a certain

17

time period local communities could have the opportunity

18

of acquiring lines and being able to continue service,
