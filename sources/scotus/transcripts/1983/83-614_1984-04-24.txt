MR. WEIDNER:

terms

20

of reversing

a prior administrative ruling.

Involved are two

statutes fundamental to the

21

governing of the banking industry, and financial

24

directly contrary to congressional intent,

25

the Board of Governors, affirmed by the Second Circuit,

in this country, the Rank Holding

3

Act.

In this case,
in our view,

1

turned two narrow exceptions in the statutes into broad

2

authorizaticns instead.

3

below should be reversed for two reasons.

4

we believe that the decision

First, the Rank Holding Company Act requires

5

that any bank affiliate, which is net a bank, be

6

involved in a business that is so closely related to

7

banking as to be a proper incident thereto.

8

been interpreted and requires that that business be

9

closely related in the sense of being -- of having a

That has

10

direct and significant connection to banking, and net

11

similar — not simply being related to it in the sense

12

of being functionally similar, which is what the Heard

13

found .

14

«

Secondly, we believe that the Glass-Steagall

15

Act prevents any affiliation cf a bank

16

that is principally engaged in the public securities

17

business, and that is the business in which the

18

affiliate here involved is here involved.

19

Briefly, the facts are these;

with an entity

In early 1982,

20

the BankAmerica Corporation, owner of BankAmerica, one

21

of the largest banks in the world , applied to the

22

Federal Reserve Board for permission to acquire the

Charles Schwab Corporation.

If I may, let me first address the Bank

Holding Company Act.

8

further the basic congressional purpose of separating

9

banking from commerce in general.

That Act was passed in 1956 to

By that Act, Congress

10

said that banks will not evade that separation through

11

the structure of a bank holding company, and said that a

12

bank holding company could not acquire a non-banking

13

subsidiary unless -- a very narrow exception -- that

14

subsidiary's business was sc closely related to the

15

business of banking to be a proper incident thereto.

16

The Board of Governors interpreted that

17

statute for the next decade as requiring a direct and

18

significant connection between the proposed activity of

19

the subsidiary and the activity of the bank holding

20

company itself.

differences between those bills.

the ramifications of what happened, but one thing, I

believe, is absolutely clear from the legislative

history, and that is that Congress did not substitute

our brief — has in fact asked the Federal Reserve Ecard

next thing we are going to hear is that because banks

23

have dispensed toaster and calculators to get depositors

24

to put money in the bank, then they can go into the

function.

No, Justice O'Connor, I don't

believe that it is.

9

But in

1

dcing that, they have uniformly forwarded the orders to

2

brokers for execution.

3

There is a significant difference here because

4

a broker who executes a trade puts his net capital cn

5

the line every time he does that.

6

whether it is one time a day or 100,000 times a day,

7

each time that trade executed that broker has got to

8

come up with the securities or cash to make good in the

9

trade.

10

In ether words,

If his customer doesn't have it, the broker has

got to come up with the money or the securities.

11

It is for that reason -- Turning to

Glass-Steagall just for a moment, because I think it

15

16

securities activities tc purchasing and selling, without

17

recourse upon the order and for the account of

18

custom ers.

19

The G1ass-Steaga11 Act was

The question is what does "without recourse"

20

mean?

This Court addressed — In its technical sense,

21

it means without endorsement or guarantee.

22

Court that specific requirement in the Awotin case, and

23

expressly flatly held that without recourse, in this

24

context, in this statute, its predecessor, is not

25

limited solely to endorsement and guarantee because it

10

But this

1

would make any sense in terms of trading and securities/

2

which are not typically endorsed or guaranteed.

3

Certainly stcck is not endorsed or guaranteed.

4

it had a broader meaning.

5

It said

Then the question is, what is the analogous

6

liability that a broker might face to a third party, if

7

it is not endorsement or guarantee?

8

liability is exactly the risk of customer fails.

9

The analogous
The

the securities or stock

10

to the third person if his customer doesn't.

11

exactly that kind of liability which we believe Congress

12

expressly legislated against in the Glass-Steaga11 Act.

13

It is

The way that a bank or a broker can accomplish

14

avoiding that liability, and many brokers do, is acting

15

as a forwarding broker, that is to say, the broker gets

16

a securities order, forwards it to an executing broker

17

on a so-called fully disclosed basis -- that is

18

disclosing the name of the customer to the executing

19

broker — who then deals directly with the customer,

20

account statements, confirmations, and the like.

21

is no recourse against the bank.

22

In fact,

There

I should point out — this is

23

something that has happened since cur reply brief was

24

filed on the same day -- the Comptroller of Currency, in

25

a proposed rulemaking reported at 49 Federal Eegister

11

has proposed regulations to deal with bank

3

One of the things that the Comptroller said in

4

that regulation a week ago was that no bank will conduct

5

a securities business in-house, except on a fully

6

disclosed basis, that is to say, forwarding the orders

7

to brokers for execution, which is what banks have dene

8

on an incidental accommodation basis for years, and

9

that, I suggest, is what the Comptroller understands

10
11

"without recourse" means in the statute.
To return to where we started, no, I don’t

12

believe that banks have been in the business of

13

executing securities orders for the public at any point

14

until they were allowed to be affiliated with Schwab

15

only two years ago.

16

QUESTION;

Are you saying under the new

17

proposed regulation that the activity considered here

18

would be made invalid?

19

NR. WEIDNEP;

It could be performed, but only

20

in a separate subsidiary.

21

perform it, that is correct.

22

If I did, I certainly

It had direct relevance because a

In our view, Congres meant tc prevent banks

15

from doing certain securities activities entirely, and

16

from affiliating with entities who are principally in

17

those securities activities.

18

what were banks pronibited from doing and how does that

19

relate tc their affiliates.

20

The question, then, is

Perhaps I could step back just brief to 1927,

21

because the stcry really start there with the McFadden

22

Act.

23

24

6

whatever, by passing along those orders to a broker for

7

execution.

The only thing that banks were doing at

8

By 1933, after the chaos had occurred,

9

Congress, in effect, realized that it had made a

10

mistake, and in the Glass-Steagall Act withdrew the

11

securities powers that it had granted in the fcFadden

12

Act of

investmetn securities, except to the limited extent of

purchasing and selling, without recourse,

I won’t return to "without recourse," but it

16
17

seems to us from the face of it that it is clear that

18

that language meant that a customer -- that a bank was

19

merely to pass a customer's orders along for execution.

20

But there really can't be much doubt about what was

In August, I believe

21

it was, or September 1 934, the Federal Reserve Foard

ruled similarly and specifically quoted the

Comptroller's language.
In 1934,

the Comptroller did return to

Congress, testified that in his view this was necessary

15

1

to expand this exception, and made clear that it was

2

only on an accommodation basis, and convinced Congress

3

to expand the statute to include purchasing and selling,

4

without recourse, on the orders, securities and stock.
Under this Court’s precedent, in Zuber against

5
6

Allen,

it seems to me that that history itself should be

7

controlling, if there were ambiguity, we dent' think

8

there is, as to what Congress intended in

The Comptroller proposed the legislation.

10

He

11

testified directly before the Congressional Committees

12

that were considering it, what his view was, and

13

Congress enacted what he proposed.

«

The respondents say, wait a minute, in

14

1933,

15

the Congressional Feports that accompanied the initial

16

Glass-Steagall Act said, "Banks shall be permitted, to

17

the same extent heretofore, to deal in securities,"

18

therefore that shows that they were permitted to be

19

public stockbrokers.

20

Banks had not been permitted prior to 1933 to broker

21

stock,

22

been permitted only to deal in investment securities.

23

But let’s look at what happened.

5

was specifically

If respondents are correct that what Congress

6

intended tc do was tc permit banks to be public stock

7

brokers, it would necessarily mean that in 1935, when

8

Congress passed a technical, ncn-substantive amendment

9

to a statute, the Glass-Steagall Act, otherwise meant

10

broadly to prohibit securities activities for banks, it

11

authorized, for the only time in 200 years, banks tc

12

become public stockbrokers.

15

QUESTION:

I suggest that simply

I thouqht that we were dealing here

16

with a bank affiliate, not the bank itself.

17

thought that the prohibition in Section 16, on its face,

18

applied to banks and net the affiliates.

19

MR. WEIDNER:

Justice O’Connor,

I alsc

we clearly are

20

dealing with a bank affiliate, and let me turn tc

21

Section 20, which deals specifically with them.

22

Let me say this that in our view the structure

23

and the history of the Glass-Steagall make it clear that

24

what Congress had in mind was, given -- remember that

25

when this was passed, given the crash and the 2,000

17

1

banks that failed in the interim, to get banks out of

2

the securities business, and it did it by prohibiting

3

certain activities entirely for banks, and prohibiting

4

them principally fcr their affiliates.

5

There is no history, although this is in

6

effect what we believe the Board and the Second Circuit

7

have held, no history, legislative or statutory,

8

suggests that the Board has discretion to authorize bank

9

affiliates to engage principally in what banks can't

engage in at all.

That we believe is what has

Let me turn to Section 20.

As I said, that

The

11

Underwriting, for example, they said, is a

12

principal activity, and so on, so brokerage is out.

13

the fact is that underwriting certainly encompasses, and

14

the Board doesn't dispute, best effort underwriting.

15

That is an agency, not a principal activity.

16

is no reason why a public sale couldn't equally well be

17

an agency as well as a principal activity.

18

But

And there

The Board, apparently recognizing the problem

19

in the Second Circuit opinion in that respect, doesn't

In other words, I think if you lock at the

statute as a whole, there is only one construction that

makes sense and it makes sense in terms of the general

congressional intent as well, that is, and if I may let

9

me read Section 20 in its entirety, "Nay net affiliate

18

or agent, in all markets, whether primary or secondary,

They have reached that conclusion by turning

4

With regard to the "without recourse" issue

5

that the petitioner places so much emphasis on, it seems

to us quite clear that the Congress did not intent to

7

preclude banks from transmitting brokerage exchange —

8

brokerage transactions in a way that they had to

9

designate who the customer was in order to avoid

10

liability of the bank.

11

them off, without setting out exactly who the customers

This Court's inquiry should be limited to the

traditionally do, and whether it is rational to conclude

that that connection is a close one.

inquiry, but Congress -- Congress delegated to the Ecard

deciding what activities are closely related to

QUESTION;

When did he specifically overturn

that prior ruling?
MR. PHILLIPS;

6

In 1982, I believe it was.

At

7

that time, he explained that it was his view that the

8

earlier interpretation was net predicated on anything in

9

the language cf Section 16, but appeared by all accounts

10

to be nothing more than a very conservative reaction to

11

the problems of problem failures.
QUESTION;

12

He didn't need to admit that he was

13

wrong,

in the first place, it is just that either his

14

prior ruling -- either one of them, his prior ruling or

15

this one, were correct.

16

MR. PHILLIPS;

True, they both can be regarded

17

-- They both unquestionably reasonable interpretations

18

of the plain meaning of the language.

19

In deciding which cf the previsions to apply

20

in this case, this Court has twice rejected efforts to

21

incorporate standards from one section in Class-Steagal1

22

and apply to other activities.

concluded that different qualifying phrases used in the

provisions mark a distinction this Court should net

By strongly urging the Court to^ limits its

submission would be no different.

Eut if, as petitioner seems all too often tc

Like their affiliates, national banks are

prohibited from underwriting securities, but they are

powers , to purchase and sell securities on behalf of

This grant of power was intended in 1933 tc

explained in seme detail in our brief, it is clear that

35

1

banks did engage in the purchase and sale of stock, and

2

other securities, for customers prior to that time, and

3

that is all that Congress meant tc ratify.

The division Congress made in the

It did not intend to illuminate the

liability cf a broker having tc cover fcr a customer who

happens to place an order.
It may be, as petitioner suggested today, that

12
13

brokerage firms place their entire assets at their

14

disposal when they execute an order, but the record in

15

this case reflects that less than 1 percent of all cf

16

the transactions executed by the Schwab brokerage firm

-- less than 1 percent involves situations where the

customer fails to satisfy his own order or his own

request.

21

any specific reference in anything in

22

Accordingly, this is not a significant

Congress could not foresee in 1933 the

23

discount brokerage activities would some day be

language that it adopted, allowing for agency actions on

It seems tc us quite clear from the

36

1

the part of bank in executing -- in the purchase and

2

sale of securities that it would clearly have upheld and

3

permitted the banks to engage in the kinds of activities

4

that Schwab undertakes here.

5

It seems to us that that interpretation, as I

6

just mentioned to Justice White, is a reasonable one,

7

and that is where this Court's inquiry should step.

8

long as the Comptroller's newest interpretation is

9

reasonable, it is entitled to deference by this Court.

10

Sc

Petitioner conjures up the horrors of the bank

11

failures of the 1930s and hints that the Board's

12

decision here is based on arguments presented in

13

connection with the regulatory and legislative decisions

14

of the mid-1920s that led to that financial disaster.

15

But the Federal Reserve Board has not turned the clock

16

back to 1927, nor created an environment of serious bank

17

failure.

18

The Board has instead adjusted to the

19

financial events of the 197Cs and the

It is petitioner and the securities firms whom

37

it represents who seek to stop the financial clock from

2

moving beyond the events of the 1970s, when that

3

industry as so structured that competition was severely

4

limited, and the only rcle fcr a bank cr the excharges

5

was to serve as an intermediary between the bank's

6

customer and the broker, with the latter receiving the

7

fee, but without any risk of competition.
Those times are gone, and the securities

8
9

industry must recognize that banks, and of particular

10

significance to this case, bank holding companies and

11

their affiliates are legitimate competitors in that

12

discrete area of securities activity concerning the

13

purchase and sale of stock as agent.
This change is not the product of regulatory

14
15

fiat,

tut rather a reasonable application of the plain

16

meaning of the statutes Congress adopted, and empowered

17

the Board to use its expertise to enforce.

18

therefore, net the Ecard's action that "should be

19

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONEE

10

If I may, several brief points.

Justice O'Connor, if I could respond briefly

tc the question cf the Ncrgan Bank and Frown Brothers

Sc far as we know, there are — there were two

13
14

banks that were on the exchange, and two kept their

15

seats,

16

inference that it was proper.

17

but I don't think we can draw from that an

First of all, remember the Comptroller

18

specifically prohibited them from engaging in public

19

securities brokerage, so it is unlikely that they did.

20

Second, there is no evidence that they did.

21

there is a perfectly good economic reason why they would

22

have retained their seats,

Third,

even though they couldn’t be

public securities brokers, simply this, there are a lot
24

of floor traders, or there were a lot of floor traders

25

who had an exchange seat simply because when there were

39

fixed commissions, if they traded on the floor

2

themselves, they didn't have to pay any commission.

3

If, as an exchange member, they used the

privilege of using a floor broker there, you only have

So that, for example,

let me turn then briefly to the Comptroller's

10
11

recent interpretation or reinterpretation.

12

that any indication that the Comptroller thought, in

13

1934 and 1935, he was convincing Congress to allow tanks

14

to become public stock brokers, just is simply

15

illogical.

I suggest

If it is true that it was important that

16
17

banks,

18

members, only partnerships could be to avoid limited

19

liability, then why was the Comptroller trying to

20

convince Congress to allow tanks to become public stcck

21

brokers when they couldn't do it?

22

like all other corporations, couldn't be exchange

Well, maybe it was because he wanted them to

23

trade in the over-the-counter market where they don't

24

have to be exchange members.

then why did he issue a regulation immediately after the

sense.

It just doesn't make any

Moreover, something that I didn't mention, but

I think tears mention, is in 1934 Congress was
