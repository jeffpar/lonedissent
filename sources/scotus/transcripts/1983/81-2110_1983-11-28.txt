4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN K. KUDATZKY, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. KUDATZKY:

6
7

may it please the Court:
We are here today to ask this Court of nip in

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

the bud a trend which we believe is pernicious to our

10

national unity, that trend being an attempt by the City of

11

Camden, among other cities, to solve in a blunderbuss

12

fashion the problem of its resident unemployment at the

13

expense of non-residents who seek the opportunity to ply

14

their trade, pursue their common calling, whatever the

15

Court cares to describe it as, in the City of Camden

16

without being discriminated against simply because they

17

are non-residents in the State of New Jersey and the City

18

of Camden.

19

It is our view that the Privileges and

20

Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution

21

applies to protect non-residents against this sort of

22

discrimination and that under the applicable tests set

23

forth by this Court for privileges and immunities issues,

24

set forth specifically in the Hicklin v. Orbeck case, that

25

the invalidation of the Camden ordinance should follow.
3

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

This case is before the Court on direct appeal

2

from the ruling of the Supreme Court of New Jersey

3

upholding the action of the administrative agency, the

4

Department of the Treasury for the State of New Jersey,

5

which approved and thereby gave life to the Camden

6

Resident Preference Ordinance.

7

The Supreme Court of New Jersey held essentially

8

that the Privileges and Immunities Clause did not vie in

9

this case either because the enactment was a municipal

10

enactment or, more accurately in my view, because the

11

discrimination on the basis of municipal residence is not

12

a right protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

13

We believe the fact that this was enacted by the

14

City of Camden as opposed to be being enacted by the State

15

of New Jersey to be insignificant and that the real

16

question is does discrimination on the basis of municipal

17

residence call into play the protection of the Privileges

18

and Immunities Clause?

19

Supreme Court of New Jersey, in our view, erred

20

factually and legally in reaching that conclusion.

21

Court felt that the impact of this ordinance would be

22

greater with respect to New Jersians who are non-residents

23

of Camden than with respect to non-residents of the State

24

of New Jersey.

25

The

We have sought to demonstrate through census

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

data that we have included in our reply brief that within

2

the standard metropolitan statistical area of

3

Philadelphia, which includes the City of Camden, certain

4

other counties in the State of New Jersey, and certain

5

counties outside of the City of Philadelphia in the State

6

of Pennsylvania, that there would be more non-residents

7

who are likely to be affected by this ordinance than New

8

Jersey residents who are non-residents of Camden.

9

We do not believe that the fact that other New

10

Jersians are adversely impacted by this ordinance either

11

renders the privileges and immunities protection

12

inapplicable or somehow serves to cure the harm done to

13

the non-residents by putting them on an equal footing

14

somehow with the New Jersians.

15

We believe that in assessing whether

16

non-residents of New Jersey are treated the same as

17

resident of New Jersey, that all residents of New Jersey

18

must be factored into the equation including the favored

19

class here, residents of the City of Camden.

20

Jersey residents are clearly treated better than residents

21

of Pennsylvania and for that reason we believe the fact

22

that the discrimination is on the basis of municipal

23

residence does not render the privileges and immunities

24

protection inapplicable.

25

QUESTION:

Some New

But the discrimination is not limited

2

to non-residents, is it?
MR. KUDATZKY:

No, Justice.

Clearly persons who

3

are not residents of the City of Camden are victimized to

4

the same extent.

5

QUESTION:

Wherever they live?

6

MR. KUDATZKY:

7

Slightly more than a year ago this Court heard

Wherever they live, yes.

8

argument in the case of White versus Mayor and Council of

9

the City of Boston, the case whose facts are replicated to

10

some extent in this case.

11

ruling in White does not foreordain the rejection of our

12

arguments here, basically for the reason that we are

13

dealing in this case with an issue reserved for decision

14

in White; namely the extent to which the Privileges and

15

Immunities Clause might afford greater protection than the

16

Commerce Clause which was at issue in White.

17

However, we believe that the

We believe that the Privileges and Immunities

18

Clause, being as it is a constitutional guarantee of

19

equality of treatment to non-residents that it is personal

20

to the individuals involved, is not something that

21

Congress can waive or authorize a violation of by state.

22

We do have UDAG money involved in this case.

23

One of the two projects to which the ordinance is

24

presently being applied has in part UDAG money funding it

25

as was the case in the Boston situation.

We also have

with its own employees, doing a lot of its own

construction work, but required that anybody who worked on

those jobs be residents of the city.

9

that?

The City of Philadelphia versus

the State of New Jersey?

12

14

Would you still be

I know it isn't.

But, I just

wondered if you had a view about it.
MR. KUDATZKY:

17

There is much to commend the view

18

basically set forth in the Court's cases on tuition

19

preference and right to public education.

20

state might have the right to prefer its own residents in

21

direct distributions of state resources to those

22

residents.

MR. KUDATZKY:

QUESTION:

Correct.

The Court has —

And that would survive the privileges

and immunities challenge as well as the commerce

challenge?
MR. KUDATZKY:

6

Well, I am not prepared to

concede that today, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

That is the Court need

What if we were?

10

(Laughter)

11

MR. KUDATZKY:

12

QUESTION:

The Court need not go that far.

Well, I know, but, what if we were?

13

What if we thought that Camden could easily have withstood

14

any kind of a constitutional attack if it simply provided

15

that its own employees had to be city residents and they

16

did all their construction work with city employees?

17

MR. KUDATZKY:

Even assuming that the could do

18

so in-house, as you are positing, I don't believe that

19

would answer the question in this case because these

20

people are clearly private employees.

21

seriously argued in my view that these employees would

22

enjoy or not enjoy rather the protections of the Fair

23

Labor Standards Act as would be the case with in-house

24

employees of the city if they were doing the construction.

25

They are different.

It cannot be

The city is seeking to go far beyond

And, we believe that is a distinction of

It is

constitutional dimension that we believe sets this case

10

apart from Boston and really undercuts the analogy in the

11

White case of these employees being city employees in an

12

informal sense as Justice Rehnquist stated.

13

We believe that the right being asserted here is

14

a right which has traditionally been held to be within the

15

protection of the Privileges and Immunities Clause as

16

interpreted by this Court and that in light of that fact

17

it is the burden of the city to come forward with a

18

showing that the non-residents here are a peculiar source

19

of the evil that the city is trying to deal with in its

20

ordinance.

city's characterization of it in its brief.

a problem of high unemployment among the residents of

That evil, we think, is a broader one than the
It is simply

It is not necessarily low employment of Camden

I think for the same reasons that Hicklin v.
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Orbeck invalidated that rationale as a savings rationale,

2

it should be invalidated here.

3

showing that whatever the causes of the unemployment

4

problems in Camden are that they are fairly traceable to

5

the activities of non-residents.
QUESTION:

6

There is just simply no

Mr. Kudatzky, the Alaska statute in

7

Hicklin had a good deal broader sweep than the Camden

8

ordinance here, didn't it?

9

geographically, but didn't they try to regulate virtually

10

I don't just mean

all private employment in the state?
MR. KUDATZKY:

11

Yes, Justice.

It was unfortunate

12

that the Hicklin court did not really address the

13

propriety of the — if I can call it the first-tier

14

regulation — the regulation of the employees who were

15

working directly on the pipeline as opposed to those

16

further down the line.

17

had what was termed the ripple effect all the way down the

18

line.

19

Clearly the Alaska higher statute

The City of Camden here is limiting its

20

ordinance in a very precise way to persons who are going

21

to be employed by contractors with whom the city deals or

22

subcontractors of those contractors on projects, either

23

funded directly by the city or through grants administered

24

by the city, which need not and are not, to my

25

understanding, limited to public works projects.

In fact,

1

to our understanding, with the nursing home project

2

presently half way done, I would say, if I can tell by

3

looking at it yesterday, is a privately-owned project or

4

at least not a city-owned project.

5

We further believe that the city has attempted

6

really to use a shotgun approach to a problem that

7

requires a surgically precise remedy.

8

attempt to limit the benefits of the ordinance to

9

unemployed persons, to persons of a certain economic

There has been no

10

level, or to persons who are qualified to work in the

11

construction trades.

12

We also do not believe that the city has

13

asserted justification that this also promotes minority

14

hiring is enough to say the ordinance —

15

QUESTION:

Would the Camden ordinance require a

16

contractor to employ someone that he regarded as

17

unqualified to be, say, a bricklayer or some other part of

18

the trade, in order to make up the 40 percent rather than

19

pick someone who he did regard as qualified who is not a

20

resident of the City of Camden?

21

MR. KUDATZKY:

The ordinance does not

22

affirmatively say qualifications are irrelevant.

I would

23

assume that that would come in when the city was trying to

24

determine the extent to which good faith compliance was

25

attempted by the contractor.

The contractor would come in
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

and say that I didn't hire this resident because he was

2

unqualified, therefore, I took a non-residents who

3

happened to be more qualified.

4

constitute sufficient good faith effort.

S

QUESTION:

That may or may not

We really can't say at this point the

6

Camden ordinance would forbid choice of a non-resident on

7

the basis of qualification even though the 40 percent goal

8

weren't met?

9
10

MR. KUDATZKY:

We can't say that at this point.

We do not believe that the invalidation of the

11

Camden ordinance would necessarily call into question the

12

continued validity of McCarthy versus the City of

13

Philadelphia that public employment itself may be limited

14

to residents.

15

The Court need not go that far as I have

16

indicated and in our view the implications of this ruling

17

are only with respect to attempts by governmental bodies

18

to influence the decisions of private employers and

19

further down the line employers — I am sorry —

20

subcontractors of private employers.

21

this case will sound the death knell of various attempts

22

by states to limit access to state resources whether

23

directly or indirectly to their own residents.

24
25

We do not think that

If I may return to my discussion of why this
case is not the same as White, I mentioned this

2

being funded by Department of Transportation money under

3

the Urban Mass Transit Act.
We have cited in our brief the interpretation of

4
5

the Secretary of Transportation that resident preferences

6

in the projects funded by such monies are impermissible.

7

So, we do not have the harmony of — the harmony with the

congressional goals that —

level.

19

recently been able to determine who is funding what

The absence of that harmony, I think, undercuts
some of the White reasoning for upholding the resident

preference there.

Here we have a situation where Congress

2

has at best spoken with a mixed voice as to resident

3

preferences.
The constitutional guarantee involved here

applies more specifically to the individual employees.

White did not really deal with the rights of individual

employees.

union groups were parties plaintiff in that case.

It seemed to deal more with the rights of the

QUESTION:

10

I suppose Congress might take this

11

thing out of the Commerce Clause challenge, but I am not

12

sure it can forgive a privileges and immunities violation.
MR. KUDATZKY:

13

Yes, that is precisely my point,

14

Justice.

15

in part by federal monies, any inference that Congress has

16

approved resident preference, I think, is unavailable in

17

this case for the simple reason that Congress is not

18

authorized to waive privileges and immunities protections.

19

With respect to those projects which are funded

We do not wish to be construed to be attacking

20

the laudible goals of the Camden ordinance.

clearly is a city with a lot of problems.

that their goals could be accomplished with less violence

to the Privileges and Immunities Clause in other ways such

as by preferring its residents for job training programs,

that that was necessary.

not traditionally, as most governmental entities have not,

3

to my understanding, built their own public works with

their own work force, but it is a method that might be

available to them and would present certainly different

issues than are presented in this challenge.
QUESTION:

The city, to my knowledge, has

Did you say, Mr. Kudatzky, at the

8

outset of your argument that your reliance is primarily on

9

Hicklin?
MR. KUDATZKY:

10

Yes, Justice.

We find little to

11

distinguish this case from Hicklin, although it is

12

clearly —
QUESTION:

13

Well, I notice that the New Jersey

14

Supreme Court — I gather this is the bottom line, isn't

15

it, because the Camden ordinance does not affect "the

16

states' treatment of each other's residents," citing

17

Hicklin.

18

think is error.

19

It does not violate any privilege.

MR. KUDATZKY:

Yes.

That you

20

Hicklin and the Privileges and Immunities Clause in

21

general in a very moderate fashion in that respect.

importance of the political accountability rationale in

2

dealing with privileges and immunities questions.
The fact that New Jersians might, if this Court

agrees with me, be in a worse position than Pennsylvanians

is not something that I really stop this Court from taking

10

non-residents, given the location of Camden, two miles

11

from the center of Philadelphia, the fourth largest city

12

in the country, are going to be adversely impacted.

13

The New Jersey Court seemed to take into account

14

the entire population of New Jersey which, I suppose,

15

would fall within pretty much a 100-mile radius of Camden.

Even within the 100-miles radius, you would pick up New

ORAL ARGUMENT OF N. THOMAS FOSTER, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

3
4
5

MR. FOSTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The City of Camden here, of course, takes quite

6

a different position than Appellants in this matter and

7

asks that this Court, if it would, to dismiss the appeal

8

and, in the alternative, to affirm the decision of the New

9

Jersey Supreme Court based on what we think are three very

10

11

critical and important premises.
First, that this case before the Court is not

12

ripe for decision because Appellants have established no

13

case of controversy.

14

Secondly, because the Camden ordinance provides

15

a basis for good or best-faith effort to provide hiring

16

preference for 40 percent of those persons employed on

17

construction projects for Camden residents does not

18

violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause and, of

19

course, the equal protection question raised by the

20

Duration Residency Clause has been mooted by amendment and

21

revision of our ordinance.

22

We noted, Your Honors, with a great deal of

23

interest, that the Appellants here have not established

24

any injury either to themselves or any member of their

25

unions. There is no record of any injury, there is no
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

record of any person being denied a job, there is no

2

record of any individual outside the State of New Jersey

3

being denied employment because of the ordinance here that

4

the City of Camden has established.

5

There are no concrete facts for this Court to

6

determine whether, in fact, if not an actual privileges

7

and immunities issues has been raised by the Appellant.

8

We have no factual backdrop to determine how many persons,

9

if any persons, have been injured by this ordinance passed

10

by the City of Camden.
We think that one of the reasons why there has

11

12

been no factual backdrop or no clear definition of a

13

concise injury or concrete establishment of a fact of

QUESTION:

different.

I do take that position, yes.
But, you would say the case would be

At least you would be making a different

10

argument if the state enacted a law saying that 40 percent

of all the people who are working on contracts that the

12

state is financing must be residents of the State of New

13

14

you would — At least you would say that case is not here

15

16

That would be a different case.

MR. FOSTER:

I don't know how

I would like to say this case is

17

not here, but I am not clear, Your Honor, if the case

18

would fail for that reason.

19

that was very important in the Hicklin case, and even in

20

the case of Toomer against Witsell, was that those cases

21

indicated that the Privileges and Immunities Clause is not

22

an absolute; that there can be distinction made between

23

citizens and non-citizens and one of the factors was

24

whether or not a state had a possessory interest in any of

25

the factors concerned such as its own resources, money, or

I think one of the things

2

There is another factor that I would like to

3

argue here. There has been some discussion about the White

4

case, White against Massachusetts Council of Construction

5

Employers.

6

Commerce Clause, found that that case did not violate the

7

Commerce Clause.

8
9

That case, of course, was founded on the

I think it is important for us to point out that
we feel that the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and

10

Immunities Clause are mutually reinforcing doctrines, each

11

attempting in its own way to establish a certain sense of

12

national unity; one vis a vis the flow of commerce, the

13

other through the flow of persons and privileges and

14

fundamental rights of citizens through the states.

15

We feel that there are times, for instance, when

16

a state does get involved in commerce, as long as it is

17

acting as a market participant rather than a market

18

regulator, that it may get involved in commerce and

19

somehow involve itself in the flow of commerce.

20

as the state is using its own money and it may distinguish

21

and favor citizens of that state which was certainly the

22

case in this Court's opinion in Hughes v. Alexandria

23

Scrap, Reeves and Stake.

24
25

As long

I think the same thing can be said true about
the Privileges and Immunities Clause, that there are times
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

when the state — when it can in the protection of certain

2

vital state interests find that it can and should favor or

3

distinguish or make distinction between its own citizens

4

and other citizens.

5

I don't feel that when those vital interests

6

are — When those particular factors are prevalent that

7

there is a violation of the privileges and immunities of

8

any particular individual.

9

We also find it interesting that here a Council

10

of Trade Unions, who probably feel that a clause in a

11

contract that says buy American is patriotic, but on the

12

other hand, a clause in a contract that says hire local is

13

unconstitutional.

14

the ordinance of the City of Camden, which attempts to

15

ameliorate certain local evils, addresses specifically

16

those evils, and simply requests of those contractors who

17

do business with it to try to hire our own.

18

We do not feel that the statute here or

In the Appellant's brief, they speak in strong

19

terms of our ordinance being exclusionary, denying access

20

to out-of-state persons.

21

The concern that we have here is that that is

22

not true and if one reads that ordinance carefully you can

23

see that it excludes no one and denies no one access and

24

impinges upon no one's constitutional right.

25

an effort by the City of Camden to address a very grave

Because it would be conditioned on

municipal residency rather than state residency.

MR. FOSTER:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Yes.

Apparently I answered that

Would it also be the same case if the

10

New Jersey legislation said every city such as Camden and

11

every other New Jersey city bordering on another state

shall require local residency as a requirement, sort of

applied to each of the cities if you can cross the river

I don't see any difficulty with

that under the Constitution.
QUESTION:

I think that —

As long as some part of New Jersey is

not covered by the statute.
MR. FOSTER:

Well, I would assume that could be

true, Your Honor.
I think the thing we have to look at is what are
we asking or what are we trying to legislate?

Remember,

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

that the ordinance of the City of Camden states very

2

specifically that for any contractor who performs public

3

works projects for the City of Camden, paid by the City of

4

Camden, either in whole or in part or through funds

5

administered by the City of Camden, attempt to hire 40

percent — Attempt to hire in his work force 40 percent

7

residents of the City of Camden.
There is no fundamental right to working on a

9

public works project in the City of Camden.

There is no

10

fundamental right to work in a public works project in

11

Trenton, Cherry Hill, Elizabeth, Jersey City, or Newark.

12

So, I would say that in terms of that there would be no

13

fundamental rights involved.
Of course, as stated earlier, there are a number

14
15

of cases, McCarthy v. Philadelphia, Detroit Association

16

against Detroit, it has been determined that even the

right to direct employment with a municipality is not a

constitutional right or fundamental right.

85,000.

MR. FOSTER:

Your Honor, approximately 34

percent of the population of the City of Camden is

9

receiving some type of social relief, welfare assistance.

10

It represents approximately one-third of our population.

11

Camden is also a community which is approximately 75

12

percent minori-ty and, of course, our unemployment rate is

13

approximately 20 percent, twice that of the nation, and

some five or six percent higher than the State of New

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN K. KUDATZKY, ESQ.

23

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL

24

MR. KUDATZKY:

25

Justice Powell, with respect to

that very point, the City of Philadelphia has suffered
37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

many of those same problems over the last decade.

2

is no evidence and no basis for assuming that

3

Philadelphians or Pennsylvanians or Delawarians have

4

caused any of these problems to be suffered by Camden.

5

I would also like to concur with, I believe,

There

6

Justice Stevens' observation that this case must be

7

analzyed as if it were 100 percent preference here,

8

because clearly, I believe, that if the city can do 40

9

percent, they can require 100 percent preference and that

10

the case should be analyzed in that fashion.

11

QUESTION:

Do you agree with the city attorney

12

that there is nothing in this record to show that anyone

13

has been injured?

14

MR. KUDATZKY:

No, Justice, I do not.

started this case as early as we could.

jobs.

City of Camden public works projects, which is not an

2

insubstantial amount.

3

While I cannot name an individual who has

4

suffered the loss of a job at this point, it seems

5

undeniable to me that some day someone is going to

6

actually lose a job, but presently people are having a

7

diminution.

MR. KUDATZKY:

QUESTION:

11

MR. KUDATZKY:

12
13

Pardon me?

Why not file suit when that happens?
Well, we didn't think that it was

necessary or appropriate to wait that long.
QUESTION:

But, you do agree that nobody —

14

There is nothing in the record that shows anybody applied

15

for a job and was denied employment?

16

MR. KUDATZKY:

I will agree that no specific

individual has done that.

18

standing does exist because these persons are likely to

19

suffer the detriment.

21

detriment in the reduction of their employability

22

We do assert, nevertheless, the

1

in my view what penalties or non-penalties might exist for

2

contractors.

3

In this case, even if one out-of-state resident

4

loses a job or an employment opportunity, I think that is

5

sufficient to confer standing and to create a privileges

6

and immunities controversy cognizable by this Court.

7

With respect to the point that we are asserting

8

a right to work on Camden public works projects, I

9

disagree that the right being asserted is so specific.

10

In Hicklin v. Orbeck people could have work on

11

non-oil and gas related jobs in Alaska, yet the fact that

12

those jobs were denied them was deemed sufficient to

13

trigger the applicability of the clause.

14

In Toomer, the shrimp people could have gone and

15

fished for something besides shrimp or fished beyond the

16

three-mile limit, yet that constriction of their

17

employability was sufficient.

18

We see a trend already under way in New Jersey

19

where two other jurisdictions have enacted protectionist

20

preference ordinances perhaps as a result of the New

21

Jersey Supreme Court's ruling here.

22

Privileges and Immunities Clause would be gutted,

23

literally gutted if it is not applicable to municipal

24

residents' discrimination.

25

allowing the state to accomplish via the backdoor what it

I think the

In State of New Jersey versus City of

Philadelphia, New Jersey could vend Philadelphia's trash

basis.

this Court's ruling would have been eviscerated.

If it could do that, but couldn't do it directly,

penalized by that certainly.
