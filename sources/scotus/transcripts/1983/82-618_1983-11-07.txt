CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Naftulin, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. NAFTULIN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

We will hear arguments

MR. NAFTULIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When we got back Mr. Kosak's oriental and art

11

collection in its damaged condition, we had a decision we

12

had to make.

13

kind of trial to make the government pay for the damage

14

that they did to Mr. Kosak's collection.

15

Could we force the government or get some

We came up with one viable alternative in which

16

we could file a suit and that was the claim under the

17

Federal Torts Claims Act.

18

This case comes down to a case of statutory

19

construction.

20

just determining the exact language of an exemption in the

21

statute, but before I get to that exact language, which

22

should be the starting point, there are a couple of

23

principles which I think this Court should keep in mind

24

and that is the Federal Torts Claims Act itself which gave

25

the citizens the right to sue the government for

Eventually we reached the point of

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

negligence in the same way as if they were suing a private

2

individual.

3

There is one main reason — There is one main

4

area in which we disagreed with the Third Circuit and that

5

is whether the waiver of sovereign immunity was a broad

6

concept or not.

7

immunity — That the Federal Torts Claims Act waived

8

sovereign immunity broadly.

9

We took the position that sovereign

The Third Circuit said, no, that this was just a

10

narrow restriction and our position was that they were

11

misreading the teachings of this Court, although they

12

accused us of doing the same.

13

When Congress passed the Federal Torts Claims

14

Act, they did it for several reasons, one being that the

15

prevalent feeling at that time was that it should be

16

fundamental to a democracy that an individual who is

17

injured should not be deprived of redress merely because

18

that injury was caused by the government.
QUESTION:

19

What has that got to do with

20

democracy?

21

majority rules and that if the majority decides that a

22

person can't sue the government, that certainly is

23

perfectly democratic, isn't it?

24
25

I thought democracy was the idea that the

MR. NAFTULIN:

Well, there are certain

principles that come into a democracy of providing for the

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

common good.
QUESTION:

2

Well, how does the the principle —

3

Up to the time of the Federal Tort Claims Act that they

4

could not sue.
MR. NAFTULIN:

5

That is correct, but you could

6

bring a private bill before the Congress, which was the

7

second reason why the Act came into being, because —
QUESTION:

8
9

Yes, but, Mr. Naftulin, isn't

your difficulty here with the language of the Tort Claims

10

Act as far as any claim — this is the language of it —

11

arising in respect of detention of any goods or

12

merchandise by any officer of Customs.

13

problem?

14

MR. NAFTULIN:

15

QUESTION:

Isn't that your

Exactly, Justice Brennan.

On the face of it that seems — What

16

happened here was there was a detention of your client's

17

goods or merchandise by an officer of Customs, wasn't

18

there?

19

MR. NAFTULIN:

20

QUESTION:

21

That is correct.

Then why doesn't that preclude

recovery under that Act?
MR. NAFTULIN:

22

Okay, for the following reasons:

23

First of all, the exemption should be narrowly construed.

24

Now, what we did was we approached it several different

25

ways.
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

The first way we used the exact words.

2

to the exact wording, "any claim arising in respect of the

3

detention."

4

We went

Now, we went to the dictionary definition of the

5

words "in respect of."

3

definitions, but what we say cited to the Court were the

7

words that Judge Weis used in his dissent.

8

to, as regards, insofar as concerns, with respect to.

9

think if you just look at the words themselves, they are

We looked at several dictionary

They mean as

10

going to the fact of the detention itself and not

11

something that arises during the detention.

12

argument is the words itself.

I

Our first

13

The second one, okay, is that you have to look

14

at all of the exemptions under 2680 and see the language

15

that was used there.

16

The Customs exemption, 2680(c), is the only one

17

that speaks in terms of in respect of, arising in respect

18

of.

19

are speaking of in terms of the Postal Service.

20

for damages, period, when they are talking about the

21

operations of the Treasury.

22

they are talking the military or combatant activities, any

23

claim arising in a foreign country, any claim arising from

24

the Tennessee Valley Authority, any claim from with the

25

Panama Canal Company, any claim arising from the

The others are all any claim arising out of that they
Any claim

Any claim arising out of when

activities of it.

2

distinction in the language of the statute.

3

for the Customs Service was the. only one that used the

4

words "in respect of."

5

There is a distinction.

There is a
The exception

Now, Congress spent 30 years writing this Act

6

and what I submit to this Court is that there is a reason

7

for this distinction.

8

a reason for this distinction.

9

As subtle as it might be, there is

So, aside from the plain meaning of the words

10

itself, you then have, looking at the entire Act itself —

11

In fact, in the Second Circuit decision, in the Alliance

12

case — The Alliance case analyzed the exception for the

13

Postal Service which was any claiming arising out of the

14

loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or

15

postal matter.

18

negligent transmission of letters.

17

It actually used the word "negligent,"

And, the Alliance court's argument was, well, if

18

the Customs Service was going to be excused for their

19

negligence, that that wording would have gone into the

20

statute as well.

21

There is a couple of other things, too, that I

22

want to point out to the Court.

For instance, this Court

23

made a decision in the case of United States verus

24

Munez in which the Court ruled that the Federal Tort

25

Claims Act did not bar a case against the United States
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

for the negligence of a federal employee, namely, a

2

prisoner worker, someone working in a prison.

3

Now, one of these exceptions here says it bars

4

under 2680(h) any claim arising out of a false

5

imprisonment.

6

Now, go back to the Munez facts in which Mr.

7

Munez was in prison and he was eventually beaten up in

8

prison, he claimed, because of negligence of the guards.

9

Suppose Mr. Munez is put in the prison — that he is

10

falsely in prison, that the government imprisoned the

11

wrong Mr. Munez, all right?

12

claim arising out of false imprisonment now bar suit under

13

these circumstances?

14

distinctions that are made in these exemptions and that

15

these exemptions must be narrowly construed.

Should that exemption, any

I think there is certain

In fact, in the case of Block versus Neill,

16
17

which was a decision by Justice Marshall, the government

18

tried to assert the exemption, any claim arising out of

19

the misrepresentation.

20

distinctions and allowed the suit to be brought on another

21

theory, on the good Samaritan theory, because the

22

government had agreed to undertake certain action in that

23

case.

24
25

QUESTION:

And, this Court again saw these

But, there the Court held that what

the Plaintiff was suing on was not a misrepresentation, so

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

it simply wasn't covered by that exception.
MR. NAFTULIN:

2

That is right, but it is still

3

arguable that it is any claim arising out of the

4

misrepresentation.
And, what I am saying — My point is that these

5

6

exemptions should not be broadly construed, but they

7

should be very narrowly construed.
QUESTION:

8
9

10

In fact —

Why should they be very narrowly

construed?
MR. NAFTULIN:

Because of the reasons for the

11

exemptions themselves.

12

prevent a harm to the government.

13

the government, then the exemption shouldn't bar the suit.

14

QUESTION:

The exemptions are meant to
If there is no harm to

Well, that really doesn't make much

15

sense to me.

16

its language and Congress has described in language what

17

it thought might cause harm to the government in terms of

18

allowing exemption.

19

language of the exemption, the fact that arguable there is

20

no harm to the government in this case, I don't think

21

would take it out of the exemption, do you?

22

I mean the exemption speaks for itself in

And, if the thing is within the

MR. NAFTULIN:

Well, I am not trying to tell you

23

to take it out of the exemption.

It is a question of how

24

you interpret the exemption.

25

this, then you just can't bring the suit and that is

If there is an exemption for

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

actually what you have to determine.

2

back to that Block versus Neill case, you could interpret

3

it broadly of any act arising out of a misrepresentation

4

or you can look at it much finer by saying, well, there is

5

a second theory here on which to go to.

6

general language doesn't block the suit.

7

9

But, if you went

Therefore, that

There had to be a reason why Congress used the
words "in respect to" here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Naftulin, generally speaking, if

10

you view the Federal Tort Claims Act as a whole, hasn't

11

this Court interpreted the waiver of sovereign immunity

12

narrowly so that it is a little inconsistent to argue that

13

you should view the exemption narrowly.

14

exemption into the Act as a whole, hasn't the Court

15

generally given the waiver a narrow interpretation?

16

MR. NAFTULIN:

If you fit the

No, I don't think that this Court

17

has given the waiver a narrow interpretation.

18

into cases like Indian Telling versus the United States

19

and Rainier, Inc. versus the United States, and even if

20

you took the Dalehite case which is the leading case on

21

sovereign immunity, it spoke in terms of the general grant

22

of sovereign immunity.

23

If you go

The Indian Telling case spoke in terms of —

24

used the word "broad" in talking about sovereign immunity.

25

The Rainier case spoke in terms of the new and novel

10

theories of tort were going to come into being.

2

probably only —

4

QUESTION:

MR. NAFTULIN:

I am sorry, I didn't hear that,

sir.
QUESTION:

7

8

Well, maybe it is time for us to

narrow it then.

5

6

There is

Maybe it is time for us to narrow it

so people like you won't misunderstand it.
MR. NAFTULIN:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well —

I never understood that when you

11

waive sovereign immunity you do it on the broadest terms.

12

I have never heard that.

13

Sovereign immunity and waiver and moral rights and equity,

14

they don't all together.

15

aren't they?

16

MR. NAFTULIN:

17

QUESTION:

They don't go together.

They are different ball parks,

I don't think that —

Sovereign immunity just says that you

18

can't sue on anything.

19

that?

Is there anything broader than

20

MR. NAFTULIN:

21

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Well, now, when you waive that —

22

They could have passed a law and said you can sue on

23

anything, but Congress didn't.

24

didn't intend to waive everything.

25

Do you know why?

What you want us to do is to rewrite the

11

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

They

1

statute.

2
3

You can rewrite it, but we can't.
MR. NAFTULIN:

Am I right?

I don't agree with you, Justice

Marshall.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. NAFTULIN:

You think we can rewrite statutes?
I agree with you on that

6

principle.

7

am not asking you to do that.

8

When Congress passes a —

9

I am not asking you to rewrite the statute.

QUESTION:

But, when Congress says —

You want us to do something about two

10

words, in respect — three words.

11

those three words?

12

I

MR. NAFTULIN:

You want us to rewrite

No, I don't want you to rewrite

13

them.

14

the same way that Congress meant to do it.

15

that I am asking this Court to do.

16

the Federal Torts Claims Act, it waived sovereign immunity

17

except in certain specific situations, the exemptions

18

under 2680.

19

I just want you to apply them and interpret them
That is all

When Congress passed

There were also certain other safeguards, which

20

I will call administrative safeguards, which were also put

21

in such as the statute of limitations or you get a

22

non-jury trial or you can't get interest or penalties, but

23

when they passed this Act, they said that you can sue the

24

government in the same situation as if you were suing an

25

individual if the individual was negligent.

They did away

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

with sovereign immunity when they did that.

2

they came up with these specifics —

3

QUESTION:

Where do we get all these cases on

4

sovereign immunity if they waived it?

5

case if they waived it?

6

MR. NAFTULIN:

7

How did we get this

Because sometimes these acts have

to be interpreted by this Court
QUESTION:

8
9

And, then

Do I correctly understand, Mr.

Naftulin, in essence what you are arguing is that the

10

exception against any liability applies only to the fact

11

of the tension of the group and —

12

MR. NAFTULIN:

13

QUESTION:

14

That is correct.

And that harm is done while they are

detained the exception doesn't apply.

15

MR. NAFTULIN:

16

QUESTION:

That is correct.

And, you arrive at that primarily by

17

emphasis on in respect of as distinguished from arising

18

from?

19

20
21

MR. NAFTULIN:

That is one of the ways I do it.

That is one of my arguments.
Another one of my arguments is the plain

22

dictionary definition of the words.

23

even more importantly than that we come to what I call the

24

area of the legislative intent.

25

I think that probably

The exemptions were brought in because, as a

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

policy matter, the government should be free from certain

2

claims or that there is certain other machinery that is

3

available in order to bring the claim.

4

When Judge Alexander Holtzoff was testifying

5

before the Senate Judiciary Subcomittee, he made certain

6

remarks which this Court even cited that footnote in the

7

Hatzlachh decision where he brought in these two

8

principles that as a policy matter the government should

9

be free from claims or that there was other machinery and

10

he gave certain examples.

11

Service and he spoke about intentional torts and at that

12

time he said as a policy matter the government should be

13

free of all — free from suit, not situaton.

14

He spoke about the Postal

Then he spoke about the Customs Service and when

15

he spoke about the Customs Service he said, because this

16

is an area in which other remedies are available.

17

the only other remedies that were available at this time

18

were remedies to challenge unlawful detentions or to

19

challenge the amount of the duty.
QUESTION:

20

Now,

On that point, may I ask you this

21

question.

Toward the end of the government's brief, they

22

discusson a common law remedy against the Customs officer

23

for negligence and then a provision, as I understand it,

24

that the government would, in effect, pay the judgment if

25

there was a recovery against the officer.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

Would you comment on that argument?

1

You said

2

when you started out that you thought your only remedy was

3

under the Federal Tort Claims Act, but what about the

4

existence of this common law remedy?

5

MR. NAFTULIN:

I agree that there is that

6

common-law remedy.

7

was that when the Customs agents were executing the search

8

warrant, one particular agent dropped a cork carving of a

9

pagoda in front of him.

The problem that we had in our case

That was the only act of

10

negligence that we actually saw.

11

Other than that, Your Honor, we couldn't prove any

12

specific act of negligence against any specific Customs

13

agent and that is why we didn't sue that.
If we could have done that, then we would have

14
15

Other than that, okay —

sued the individual Customs agents themselves.
QUESTION:

16

But, you could have sue one of them

17

for that one item then?

18

MR. NAFTULIN:

19

QUESTION:

Correct.

And, you couldn't possibly in

20

discovery in that case have asked questions about the

21

handling of the other items?
MR. NAFTULIN:

22

Well, we thought about that, but

23

I am sure — We felt certain at that time that the answers

24

that we would have gotten were that we know nothing about

25

this.

We know nothing about how this happened or why this

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

happened.

2

We considered that theory.
We considered filing an action under the Tucker

3

Act for a breach an implied contract of failment.

4

considered an action under the Federal Torts Claims Act.

5

And, this one really seemed to us to be the only viable

6

alternative.

We

We figured that — Well, we really balanced

7

8

whether the government — The reason is here really for

9

the exemption.
We recognized the need for the Customs Service

10
11

to be able to seize property.

12

that.

13

it won't hinder them in what they are doing.

14

have free reign in being able to seize and detain.

15

shouldn't have to worry about whether they are going to be

16

sued for doing it.

17

We really didn't dispute

But, the reason why that is a necessity is so that
They should
They

But, after they do that, there is no reason why

18

they shouldn't have to handle the property with care.

19

Customs seizes items which are very valuable, which are

20

worth a lot of money.

21

there was an oriental clock, the equivalent of a

22

grandfather clock, which they just decided it was too

23

impossible for them to move that clock, that it definitely

24

would have been damaged if they did that.

25

In fact, in this particular case,

You really have to balance what we are trying to

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

protect here in determining whether the exemption applies

2

or not.

3

And, our point is that the basis of the

4

exemptions were in order to protect a harm against the

5

government and when you are — Well, our point is that it

6

wasn't the intention of Congress to give the Customs

7

Service a license to be negligent.
QUESTION:

8
9

Mr. Naftulin, the government also

noted, I think, in its brief that Judge Holtzoff, who was

10

apparently the drafter of this section, had analogized the

11

draft to a provision in the British Tort Claims Act and

12

patterned it after that under which very clearly damage

13

caused by negligence of the Customs officers would not be

14

covered.

15

the legislative history?

16

Is that relevant to our inquiry then by way of

MR. NAFTULIN:

I think it is to some extent.

17

And, I also felt that that section helped us to a great

18

degree, Justice O'Connor, because the British Act, the

19

Crown proceeding that the government was referring to

20

there was speaking primarily of damages for deterioration

21

to the property or damages for delay.

22

the general language of the Crown proceeding said more

23

than that, but the words about the detention or the

24

detention were not in the part of the original statute.

25

They were added on and I think that it supports our

I will concede that

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

position that they were added on to clearly specify that,

2

well, you can't sue them for the delay or for the

3

deterioration of the goods.

4

detention, not so much during the detention.
QUESTION:

1

This is a straightforward case of statutory

2

construction that is governed by the Plain Meaning Rule.

3

There is nothing the least bit ambiguous about the

4

statutory language even if there were the legislative

5

history and the policy reasons that lead Congress to enact

6

the various exemptions to the Tort Claims Act.

7

support the Court of Appeals construction —

8
9

QUESTION:

All

Can you raise your voice a little,

Ms. Oberly?

10

MS. OBERLY:

Yes, sir.

11

Turning first to the statutory language, the

12

exemption in Section 2680(c) is about as broad as anything

13

Congress could have written.

14

immunity for any claim arising in respect to the detention

15

of goods held by Customs officers.

16

Congress retained sovereign

Petitioner's property in this case was seized

17

and detained because the Customs Service suspected that he

18

brought it into the country in violation of the Customs

19

laws and clearly —

20

QUESTION:

Isn't.it possible to read that

21

language though, Ms. Oberly, as dealing in kind of a

22

common-law notion of detinue, intentional detention by the

23

Customs agent and not reaching just negligent mishap while

24

it is in the process of being detained?

25

MS. OBERLY:

It is our position, Justice

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Rehnquist, that there is just nothing in the wording of

2

the statute or in its grammatical construction that

3

supports a distinction between the fact of detetion alone,

4

such a delay damages, and damages that happen to property

5

while it is in the possession or while it is being

6

detained by the Customs Service.
QUESTION:

7

The language would certainly allow

8

that distinction, don't you think?

9

terribly precise language.
MS. OBERLY:

10

I mean it isn't really

If the Court were to construe the

11

language as allowing that distinction, it would simply be

12

reading something into the language that is not there.

13

There is nothing in the language that purports to

14

distinguish among different types of harm that might occur

15

in relation to a detention.

16

In both situations —

17

QUESTION:

But, you are reading it as if instead

18

of it saying in respect to it said in the course of, and,

19

those are two different phrases I think.
MS. OBERLY:

20

Justice Rehnquist, one Petitioner's

21

main arguments was that there is some special significance

22

to the phrase "in respect of," and that somehow limits

23

detention to damages caused by the fact of detention

24

alone.

25

also relied on that same distinction.

And, the dissenting Judge in the Court of Appeals

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

But, in fact, throughout the legislative history

1

2

of the Tort Claims Act, Congress described this exemption

3

as barring claims arising out of the detention of propety.

4

Congress interchangeably used in the legislative history

5

in the statute the phrase "in respect of" and the

6

description "arising out of."

7

So, we think it is quite clear that by that

8

interchangeable use that Congress could not have intended,

9

or it would have said so, to be attaching some special

10

limited significance to the phrase "in respect of."
Whenever Congress described the exemption, it

11
12

used the broad language that the dissenting opinion in the

13

Court of Appeals would have found sufficient to bar

14

Petitioner's claim.
Just to repeat, there is simply nothing in the

15
16

legislative history to suggest that Congress ever thought

17

about making the sort of precise distinction you are

18

talking about.
QUESTION:’

19

20

It is true though that there is a

difference in the language.
MS. OBERLY:

21

There is, but it is negated in this

22

case by the fact that Congress in every committee report

23

described this exemption, which is phrased "in respect

24

of" as barring claims arising out of the detention of

25

property.

1

You mean in effect that Congress, in

saying "in respect of," in fact, is simply using another

way of saying from.

6

MS. OBERLY:

Congress — In the legislative history —

8

QUESTION:

9

Or arising out of or —
Arising out of or from.
Or from, that is correct.

Is there any other subdivision or

section where "in respect of" appears?
MS. OBERLY:

10

No, there isn't,

Your Honor, but

11

it is clear, we think, from the legislative history that

12

Congress had no special intention in mind when it used the

13

phrase "in respect of."
There is no explanation in the legislative

14
15

history for one cause having "in respect of" and other

16

having "arising out of," but the most logical one is that

17

these exemptions were not all enacted at the same time or

18

by the same people.

than either "arising out of" or —
MS. OBERLY:

use "from."

"Arising out of" is the most common.

I don't believe that any of them

Well, if you have to go to the

MS. OBERLY:

1

I don't think

I think "in

respect of" is virtually identical to "arising out of" and

3

I think it is quite a hypertecnnical dictionary

4

construction for the Court to conclude that "in respect

5

of," without regard to the legislative history, really has

6

this special, limited meaning.

7

disagrees, the minute you turn to the legislative history,

it is apparent that Congress didn't view there to be any

distinction between those two phrases because —

Let's assume that his only defense was that he has been

MS. OBERLY:

employees acting within the scope of their employment.

So, if you have as a hypothetical a customs agent who just

object that passes by his inspection line, he might well

not be —

10

That may be so.

That may be so, but

11

would it be in respect of the detention?

12

how you would react to an intentional tort if the only

13

defense was, well, the statute — I just listened to the

14

Solicitor General's representative say that this language

is plain and it exempts all kinds of — It excludes any

kind of —

MS. OBERLY:

I want to know

The plain meaning of the statute

would, in my view, be broad enough to cover the example

19

you are giving, but that is not necessarily a reasonable

20

construction and there would be other ways of dealing with

21

an agent's misconduct in those circumstances.

22

QUESTION:

You wouldn't have to get into all

23

those other difficult questions if this is a plain meaning

24

of this statute at issue here is that it would also

25

foreclose any actions for intentional torts.

That would

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

be the end of the case.

2

MS. OBERLY:

Congress, Your Honor, specified the

3

situations in which it was willing to assume the common

4

law liability of the Customs collector.

5

those limitations in 28 U.S.C. 2006, which was enacted

6

over 100 years ago in 1863.

7

for shifting the common-law liability of a collector to

8

the United States is that the collector had made his

9

seizure based on probable cause or on the directions of a

10

It specified

And, one of the conditions

superior officer.

11

In the example you are giving, his seizure or

12

his detention almost certainly would not satisfy a

13

probable cause requirement.

14

QUESTION:

I just assume that if it was a proper

15

seizure the only thing is the Custom officers — one of

16

them deliberately damaged the goods.
MS. OBERLY:

17
18

I think the most appropriate remedy

in that case would be to sue him personally.
QUESTION:

19

But, you would purport to — I take

20

it you think the statute we are talking about here would

21

bar an action for intentional torts as well as negligent.
MS. OBERLY:

22

As well as Subsection (h) of the

23

Tort Claims Act exemptions which also bars intentional

24

torts.

25

QUESTION:

May I ask a question on the

referred to arising out of rather than in respect of.

No, it is not, Your Honor.
So this is a new argument.
So you should write it down.

the argument before.
MS. OBERLY:

committee reports, but those —

22

MS. OBERLY:

QUESTION:

What is the force to your argument in

11

the brief that one of the purposes of the exemption was to

12

avoid all this kind of litigation?

13

MS. OBERLY:

It wasn't just to avoid litigation.

14

It was to avoid creating additional or inconsistent

15

remedies where Congress was satisfied that the existing

16

remedies were adequate.

17

QUESTION:

Well, do you think the existing

18

remedy is adequate if there is some difficulty in

19

identifying which officer caused the damage?

20

MS. OBERLY:

I think there would be no problem

21

in Petitioner suing the Customs Director for the Port of

22

Philadelphia, who was clearly the superior —

23

QUESTION:

So, what your case really boils down

24

to is that they filed the wrong kind of complaint.

25

should have sued the Customers officer in common law and

28

They

asked for relief against the United States if they get the

judgment.
MS. OBERLY:

3
4

That is correct and it makes a

difference.

5

QUESTION:

So what is all the fight about?

6

MS. OBERLY:

It is not an academic distinction

7

between our position and Petitioner's.

8

in 28 U.S.C. 2006 Congress attached conditions to the

9

dircumstances under which is was willing to accept the

10

liability of the Customs collector.
QUESTION:

11
12

Namely that there was probable cause

for the seizure.
MS. OBERLY:

13
14

The reason is that

That there was probable cause or he

was acting on the orders of a superior officer.
QUESTION:

15

Which is true in 99 percent of the

16

cases, isn't it?

17

preserve the government's immunity in that one percent.
MS. OBERLY:

18
19

percent.

I don't know whether it is 99

I assume it is true in most cases.
QUESTION:

20
21

So, what you are trying to do is

Well, certainly they don't seize

property without probable cause very often.
MS. OBERLY:

22

Most Customs searches are without

23

warrants.

This case is somewhat unusual in that there was

24

a search warrant.

25

probable cause even though —

I assume that they are usually with

1

QUESTION:

But, am I correct in believing that

2

the practical significance of the government's position

3

relates only to those cases where the seizure itself was

4

unj ustified?
MS. OBERLY:

5

Yes, Your Honor, but it is

6

significant because Congress has provided one remedy and

7

attached a condition to it and it is — Under those

8

circumstances we think it is inappropriate for the Court

9

to wipe those conditions or those restrictions out of

10

Congress' earlier statute by providing Plaintiff with an

11

additional remedy.

12
13

QUESTION:

Well, under 2006 do you get a jury

trial?

14

MS. OBERLY:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

The Customs collector would.
So that is an additional difference

between the Tort Claims Act and —
MS. OBERLY:

That is true.

It would be an

18

ordinary tort action in state court which we might, if we

19

were defending the Customs collector, might remove to

20

federal court, but I would assume the Customs collector is

21

entitled to a jury trial.

22

But, it is particularly inappropriate for the

23

courts to imply out of this Tort Claims Act an additional

24

remedy for the Plaintiff here or any similar plaintiff

25

when Congress specifically said that one of the reasons it

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

was enacting this exemption was that it was satisfied that

2

the existing remedies were adequate.

3

completely undoing Congress' decision that it was

4

perfectly happy to rest on the existing remedies and not

5

add an additional remedy if the Court were to take the

6

position that really there is no difference between these

7

two remedies and so will we let Petitioner or any other

8

plaintiff have access to his choice of remedies.

9

didn't intent for there to be a choice of remedies in this

We would be

Congress

10

situation, because, in fact, it knew about and was

11

satisfied with the long-standing common-law remedy and the

12

conditions under which it was willing to assume the Custom

13

collector's liability.

14

There is another statutory remedy which we also

15

did not mention in our brief and which would not have

16

afford complete relief to Petitioner, but is, in fact,

17

useful in the type of situation we are talking about.

18

Before Congress enacted the Tort Claims Act in

19

1946, it had passed a Small Claims Act in 1922.

That

20

statute was for the most part repealled when the Tort

21

Claims Act was passed, but there was one important

22

exception to the repeal.

23

Claims Act could still be used by agency heads as a grant

24

of discretionary authority to settle any tort claims that

25

were for less than $1,000 and that could not be brought

Congress provided that the Small

under the Tort Claims Act because of one of the

2

exemptions.

3

That statute

4

and what it allows the

5

federal agency to do is grant them discretionary authority

8

to settle claims for under $1,000 —

Customs Service or any other

Was that remedy available to this

Petitioner?
\

MS. OBERLY:

9

Yes, it was, if he was willing to

10

waive$11,000 of his claim, because there

is no judicial

11

review under that statute and acceptance of the settlement

12

under that statute constitutes final settlement of the

13

claim.

14

QUESTION:

The limit here is $1,000, is it?

15

MS. OBERLY:

16

So, we recognize that it wouldn't have provided

Yes.

17

the complete relief he wanted, but what is worth noting

18

about the statute is that the Customs Service frequently

19

does use it to compensate similiar types of accidents.

20

For example, if a traveler is passing through

21

Customs inspection at an airport and a Customs inspector

22

accidentally drops the traveler's camera, if the value of

23

the camera is less than $1,000, the agency can and does

24

use the authority of the Small Claims Act to reimburse

25

that traveler for the injury or damage to his camera.

32

Right.

And, that is the most —

Is that statute cited in your brief?
No, it is not, Your Honor.
This is another new argument?
Yes, although I called Petitioner's

counsel on Friday and told him about the statute.
We think this is a reasonable compromise

11
12

legislative judgment that Congress made, whereby it is

13

willing to assume or have agency heads assume liability

14

for small claims under $1,000, but it is not willing to

15

assume liability for the potentially much larger claims

16

like Petitioner's or others, and the reason Congress would

17

not have wanted to do that is the vast scope of Customs

18

Service operations.
As we pointed out in our brief, Customs last

19

year, in 1982, made 59,000 separate seizures, not

21

including seizures related to the drug laws.

Is the exemption there limited to Customs

that it applies to any seizure by any law enforcement

No, no, I am assuming that there was

like that.
MS. OBERLY:

The Ninth Circuit, which is the

3

only court to address this, originally in a concurring

4

opinion by Judge Tang — Judge Tang expressed the view

5

that it did not include any other law enforcement officer,

6

that it was limited to Customs or Revenue officers or

7

other officers acting in that capacity.

8
9

But, in the subsequent opinion, the Ninth
Circuit, noting Judge Tang's opinion, said it disagreed

10

with that and that the plain language of the statute did,

11

in fact, cover any other law enforcement agency.

12

So, the statute frequently has been used to

13

cover agencies like the Food and Drug Administration when

14

they seize potentially adulterated food.

15

QUESTION:

It would clearly protect them for the

16

delay and the alleged conversion, but it also has been

17

held that it protects them from damage to the property.

18

MS. OBERLY:

Yes.

Let's say that the food is

19

stored in a negligent manner so that it becomes worthless

20

even though it is ultimately returned to the claimant.

21

has been held that this section bars actions for the value

22

of the lost food.

23

QUESTION:

It

And, drawing the distinction between

24

conversion and property damage.

25

MS. OBERLY:

That is correct.

The vast scope of Customs operations that I was

1

2

referring to a moment ago is another important policy

3

reason that supports our reading of the statute.

4

In the legislative history of the Tort Claims

5

Act, Congress expressed considerable concern that certain

6

types of claims offered great potential for abuse and for

7

fraudulent or excessive claims.

8
9
10

Given the number of Customs seizures each year,
that certainly is a realistic possibility in this
situation.

11

The problems of proof for the government would

12

be enormous because it is simply not realistic to expect a

13

Customs inspector to be able to remember the details of

14

every inspection and yet when the owner of property comes

15

into court in a tort claims action and claims that his

16

propety was in perfect condition and the Customs Service

17

really can't remember what happened with that seizure, it

18

has no effective way of rebutting the claim.
QUESTION:

19

Yes, but they will be liable under

20

the

21

they?

22

common-law theory or a tort claim.

common-law theory in all of those situations, won't
I mean, they have the same problem if it is

MS. OBERLY:

Except that the government has

24

protected itself to some extent by imposing limitations on

25

when it is willing to shoulder the Customs collectors'

common-law liability.
QUESTION:

But, in all the cases in which the

seizure was lawful, the problem is identical?

MS. OBERLY:

MS. OBERLY:

7

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Which is most cases.
That is correct.
Well, your answer to Justice Stevens

8

indicates that if this suit had been brought against the

8

individual Customs officer in this case, it would not have

10
11
12

been affected by this statute.
MS. OBERLY:

By the Tort Claims Act, that is

right, it would not have been.

13

QUESTION:

And, he might have won it?

14

MS. OBERLY:

If he could have proved negligence,

15

he might have won and almost certainly the United States

16

would have paid the judgment in this case.

17

QUESTION:

Is that action still open?

18

MS. OBERLY:

No, it is not open to him because

19

the Pennsylvania statute of limitations has expired.

is a two-year statute.

No.
But, the suit, you say, would be

MS. OBERLY:

Pennsylvania seems the logical

place to me because the seizure occurred there, Petitioner

lives there, the Customs agents responsible are there from

the Philadelphia Customs office.
QUESTION:

So, it wouldn't be state law barred

distinction but that is simply no justification for the

18

Court to rewrite the Tort Claims Act.

QUESTION:

Even if in —

Well, it is no justification for

18

rewriting assuming this is what Congress intended, of

19

course, but Congress did use different words in this

20

section than used in any other section.

we weren't aware of this legislative history that you

22

mentioned until today.

MS. OBERLY:

It came to my attention through a

student note on this case and which the student said he
