Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

The instant matter before the Court this

Thank

you.

afternoon, Paten v. Yount, presents this Court a bread,

10

general question dealing with the impact of pretrial

11

publicity upon the ability to select and empanel a fair

12

and impartial jury, as well as a question dealing with

13

what if any standard is to le provided to the federal

14

courts for purposes of reviewing a state court

15

conviction.

16

general question is a much narrower, much smaller

17

question.

18

that being what standard is to be applied by a federal

19

court to a state court determination of the

20

impartiaility of not only just one juror but cf a jury

21

panel as a whole.

22

However, contained within that bread and

However, that question is very important, and

Now, the basic factual history setting forth

23

these particular issues have previously been

exhaustively covered both in the record and in the brief

of counsel.

With regard to the 2254 analysis, the

2

respondents in their brief rather summarily dismiss this

particular issue.

this particular case but also to the federal circuits

and the federal district courts.

However, it is the petitioners*

The courts since the

10

determination, and of course, as part cf that struggle,

11

that has led to a conflict between the state and the

12

federal court systems.
With the amendment in 1966 of Section 2254 by

13
14

adding a prevision 2254(d), Congress initially made an

attempt to attempt to alleviate some of this particular

It wasn't until this Court's decision in

QUESTION s

Cf what?

2

MR. PELL:

State court determinations

3

basically as to factual matters.

4

QUESTION:

Fact, yes.

5

ME. E ELL :

Yes, net the mixed questions cf

6

7

fact and law.
With regard to that particular decision, it

8

set forth that the federal courts must not only note the

9

previsions cf 2254, tut that they must go cne step

10

further and indicate the basis of their analysis sc the

11

reviewing court could review their determination, cn

12

what basis did they decide that the state ccurt

13

determination as to a factual matter wculd not be

14

accorded the presumption cf correctness?

15

New, in essence,

what we have in the present

16

case before the court today, we have a state trial ccurt

17

and Pennsylvania State Supreme Ccurt determination as tc

18

the issue of juror impartiality.

19

that must be addressed is is this a factual

20

determination, or is this a determination cf a mixed

21

question of fact and law?

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

So the first question

This was at the second state trial,

was it not, Mr. Bell?
MR. EFLL:

Yes, this was at the second state

trial in 1970.

tfF. EELL:

Fourteen years ago, yes.

Is it correct that this, the act

charged in the indictment occurred in

Yes.

1S66?

The actual occurrence ir this

particular case was April 28 of 1966.

7

was held with a decision being reached by the jury

8

October 7 of

9

November 20th of

10

The first trial

1966, and then the second trial occurred in
*70,

1970.

With regard to the issue as to whether this is

11

a factual determination, I would submit to the court

12

that what we have in essence here is a determination of

13

a credibility issue by the trial court judge, in this

14

particular case, Judge Charry,

15

indications from the person on the voir dire, that

16

person indicating as tc whether they had an opinion, did

17

not have an opinion, whether it was fixed or unfixed, or

18

even where they could set that opinion aside, what the

19

trial court judge was doing in that case was determining

20

the credibility of that particular person, was what they

21

were saying is believable based upon their demeanor,

22

their tone, the inflection in their voice.

and hearing the

23

New, this particular issue as tc credibility

24

is a very difficult issue tc determine on the basis cf

25

appellate review.

As this Ccurt has indicated that

3

it is very difficult tc have a flavor cf what went cr.

4

actually during the course of the trial, during the

5

course of the voir dire examination.

6

here is a determination by the trial judge as tc these

7

individual jurors and as to the panel as a whole, the 12

8

individuals that were selected, that they were

impartial.

11

Marshall v. Icngberger, which indicated that a

12

judge, in this particular case, the trial judge in

15

Clearfield County.

16

are dealing with here is an issue as tc fact, net a

17

mixed question as to the law in fact.

18

particular case, Irvin v. lewd, which the Federal Ccurt

19

of Appeal in the Third Circuit applied to this

20

particular case, I submit tc the Court was misapplied.

21

What the Court cf Appeals did in essence was determine

22

the statistical analysis based on the individuals as a

23

whole whe were not selected for the panel fer varicus

24

reasons, and used that in order to overturn the sworn

25

testimeny cf the individuals on their vcir dire

indicating that either yes cr no, they had opinions, and

2

yes or nc, that they would set them aside.

3

In essence, we also have a decision net only

4

as to this credibility, tut also as indicated tefere

5

this particular Court, in varicus ether cases of the

6

court.

7

1566 -- and I just ncte in passing that Irvin v. Ecwd

8

predated that in 1961 -- the various decisions cf this

9

Court mention this issue as to juror impartiality and

Prior to the beginnings of 2254(d), which was in

10

the struggle that was working with regard to it.

11

back in 1878 in Reynolds v. United States, they talk

12

abcut publicity at that early date, and they indicated

13

the struggle that once again occurred with challenges

14

for cause as to publicity, as to prejudice, as to the

15

jurers to be selected, and also in the Polt v. United

16

States in 1910.

17

these cases, the Ccurt did net deal with a 2254 analysis

18

but simply indicated that a state court determination

19

with regard to those particular issues, which it did

20

indicate at that time was a mixed question cf fact and

21

law, should be dealt with by the Ccurt by Granting great

22

deference tc the trial court decision.

23

Clear

At that particular time with regard to

Even in Irvin v. Dowd there is a citation to

24

the Reynolds case and tc Holt indicating once again that

before this particular Court, that the court should

2

defer to that particular case.
As I mentioned, since the 2254 came into

4

effect, this Court has on several occasions dealt with

5

this particular issue once again, initially in Sumner v.

6

Mata, which was once again a mixed question as to fact

7

and law dealing with a photographic display to various

8

witnesses.

9

that particular time, in particular dealing with the

There were several questions addressed at

10

circumstances surrounding the identification as to

11

whether the victim had sufficient time in order to

12

accurately see what occurred and who her assailants

13

were, or the assailants were, whether the witness failed

14

to give an adequate description to the authorities, and

15

thirdly, whether there was any pressure placed upon the

18

individual by prison officials in order to get him to

17

identify this particular individual.
Now, this Court has on two occasions with

18

regard to Sumner v. Mata addressed this particular

issue.

13

didn't make any finding concerning him.
Hew does your argument — does your argument
respond to Judge Garth's concern?
NR. BELL:

Yes.

In essence with regard to Mr.

14

Hrin, who is the major problem for the prosecution in

15

this particular case, his voir dire examination, the

16

trial court did not specifically refer to his testimony

17

in any of its opinions.

18

the respondents have brought up, as the trial court said

19

at one point that most if not all of the individuals

20

seated had a -- did not have a fixed opinion.

21

Pennsylvania Supreme Ccurt, which under Sumner v. Mata

22

is a state court determination, their review on appeal,

23

did specifically state that with regard to Kr. "rin and

24

the other individuals -- they did not mention Mr. Erin's

25

name in essence, but they did state that upon their

the issue as tc whether challenges fer cause were

5

improperly resolved by the court.
CCESTICN :

6

Yes, but Justice Fcberts didn't

7

mention the problem that Jurcr Hrin had a predisposition

8

tc find the man guilty and put the burden on the

9

defendant to explain why he was innocent.

10

MR. BELL:

Ycur Hcnor --

11

Justice Roberts didn't mention that

problem, did he?
MR. BELL:

19

In the next sentence, practically, he says

20

that he would require some evidence before he would

21

charge his opinion.

22

The petitioner's position with regard to that

The testimony at the voir dire cbvicusly is

It certainly is ambiguous.

What we would submit to the Court are two

23

things with regard tc that.

First of all, as to his

24

testimony that he would require some evidence, he has

25

never indicated that he would require some evidence by

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

2

He simply says that he would enter the lox with an open

3

mind.

examination that he would listen tc the evidence

5

presented and decide the case solely on the evidence and

6

the facts presented to the court.

At one point he does indicate in the voir dire

However, he indicated that once evidence

Judge Charry in his denial of the challenge

20

for cause in essence based it upon the fact that he said

21

that he could go in with an open mind.

22

after that challenge for cause, what occurred was that

23

defense counsel continue tc question Mr. Hrin when on

24

questioning him after that point, and on page 89a cf the

26

record before this particular Court, he questioned with

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

Mr. Hrir with a, in essence a double question.

He asked

2

him whether he could set aside his opinion, whether it

3

was solid, unsclid, or however you wish to deserite it,

4

or whether he could enter the jury box and would need

5

some evidence before he could change his mind, and he

6

asked him to think about it beforehand.
In response to that, he said I have to.

Defense counsel said is that a yes or a no, or could I

it with a very open mind.

And then he related it

He indicated that oftentimes, whenever

With regard to Hr. Hrin's specific, we would

20

indicate to the Court that although the defense did

21

challenge him for cause, as I have indicated, and it was

22

denied, they continued to question him, and at that time

23

we would submit he did give a proper response.

basically dealt with his counsel and the fact that he

had ineffective assistance cf counsel.

tc either amend his petition at that time or

addressed that his counsel was ineffective due tc a

10

failure to either further challenge Mr. Hrin after these

11

statements or not.
In essence, with regard tc Mr. Hrin, however,

12
13

after that initial challenge for cause was denied and he

14

was questioned and gave a proper response, what occurred

was the defense counsel subsequently accepted him as a

QUESTION:

Do you think it's right?

20

MR. BELL:

Ycur Honor, I would net hedge tc

21
22

make a guess at that.
With regard to the selection, as I indicated,

23

and with regard to this, the Ccurt at the very beginning

24

of the selection process instructed the persons on the

25

first panel that they should not read any press with

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62A-0300

1

regard tc the case.

It is correct that scire of the very

2

last jurors were selected from subsequent panels whc

3

would have had a chance tc review it not knowing that

4

they were even involved in the particular proceeding.
I believe the testimony, however, given at the

5
6

time indicated that their knowledge as tc the case

7

recently was basically that it was coming up, that the

8

jury selection was gcing on with regard to the

9

particular case, net in essence as tc the first trial or

10

otherwise.

11

I believe the total concept of the testimony

12

given with regard to the selection of jurors indicates

13

that in essence they were aware of the case from the

14

pricr publicity that was given tc it mere than the most

15

recent publicity that it was coming once again tc a new

16

trial.

17

Feturning back tc the publicity issue, there

18

are basically two manners in which this Court has

19

indicated publicity is reviewed, an utterly corrupt the

20

trial standard, which is Estes v. Texas, Sheppard case,

21

etc., and all the courts have agreed there was net this

forth in the appendix are the newspaper articles that

What can be gathered from the facts of the

18

people questioned that he admitted he did it before, he

19

confessed before, statements I think that are very

20

accurately revealed in the testimony of Vera Krapf, one

21

of the jurors who was a minister's wife and who when

22

questioned indicated that the people from the

congregation came to her and stated

find this was the atmosphere in the community

5

from which this jury was selected and from which scire 72

6

percent of the jurors admitted that they had an opinion

7

of guilt and were successfully challenged for cause, and

8

a higher number of jurors admitted opinions, the

9

question becoming primarily, as previously indicated,

10

whether particularly one of them, Juror Hrin, was sc

11

prejudiced and partial that he should not have been

12

permitted to sit as a juror on this case.

13

Sc his testimony has already teen mentioned in

14

the first argument, indicating that he admitted that he

15

had a fixed opinion and that he would require testimony

16

to be presented before he could change that opinion.

17

CUESTICN:

Sr. Schumacher, I think one of your

18

opponent's positions is that if one takes Juror Hrin's

19

various answers, as the first questioned by the defense,

20

then by the prosecution, one gets several different

21

versions of an answer to that question, that admittedly

22

that answer was given, but also something that could be

23

called contradictory to it.

24
25

Why isn’t that an ambiguity in his overall
testimony that is test resolved by the trial judge?

with Judge Ziegler's opinion was that he stepped at the

12

crucial points where the questions that I'm indicating

13

would indicate juror bias and stressed some of the

14

points that Your Honor previously mentioned.

Well, tut don't you think in all

fairness we have tc lock at the entire exchange on vcir

18

jurcr was questioned?
ME. SCHUMACHER:

19

Yes, I do.

I think that’s

20

only fair.

And I would also submit that the

21

Commonwealth arguing that the -- we were attempting to

22

mix apples and oranges is as similar as their attempting

23

tc mix Icngberger and Fushan with Irvin and Murphy

24

because there are totally different concepts involved

25

there with post-trial hearings in which credibility was

2

fashion than was accomplished in this case, and unless

3

this Court now is facing the prospect cf reversing Irvin

4

v. Dowd, we would still rely on the position that the

5

nature and strength cf the venireman's opinion is a

mixed Question cf law and fact, and as such, each cf the

7

habeas corpus courts must independently review the

That is correct.

And you will let me knew if ycu

8

MR. SCHUMACHER;

I will.

9

I knew that the Ccurt cf Appeals was very

10

specific in its treatment of 2254 and its analysis

11

indicating that this was a mixed question cf law and

12

fact,

13

dire testimony as well as the pretrial publicity, and of

14

course, we have never maintained that the publicity was

15

of such a nature as to utterly corrupt the trial as in

16

the Sheppard case, and have ccnsistently maintained the

17

burden

18

order to come forward and satisfy the test that he was

19

denied

20

and that it had independently analyzed the vcir

cf requiring -- of prejudice in this case in

a fair trial.
But the Third Circuit in its opinion very

21

clearly pointed cut that it felt this was a mixed

22

question of law and fact and that the determinations of

23

the state courts and the District Ccurt for the Western

24

District of Pennsylvania were clearly erroneous.

25

so in several regards, in regard to the publicity, in
