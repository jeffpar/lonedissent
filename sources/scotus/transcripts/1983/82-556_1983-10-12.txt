ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEE

MR. WARDi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this is a closure case involving

11

specifically the issue of closure of the voir dire

proceedings in a capital case.

14

to the courtroom by the public and the press.

capital cases.

He are in fact asking the Court to clarify

that the right of access to establish that that right of -

7

access applies to the jury selection process generally.

8

We are asking this Court to pronounce that the

9

California Supreme Court case of Hovey versus Superior

10

Court should be construed and applied consistent with

11

the right of access.
QUESTIONS

The Supreme Court of California is the final

MR. WARD;

Justice Pehnguist, the Supreme

18

Court of the state of California pronounced a rule in

19

this case as to the method cf selecting jurors in

20

capital cases which has been, in our opinion,

21

misinterpreted by the trial courts of our state in a way

22

that has impacted upon our constitutional rights.

23

would be our position that this Court could most

assuredly pronounce that the case should not be

25

We could certainly say that if it

2

were so construed, it would have an impact on your

rights, I suppose.

MS. WARD;

I believe we are saying the same

thing.

Justice Rehnquist, in a different — at least I

The defendant in the case below was found

7
8

guilty and sentenced to death in connection with a rape

9

and murder.

During the trial, the court closed

the

10

proceedings during six weeks of voir dire proceedings.

11

The transcript of the six weeks of voir dire was sealed

12

by the court.
Three times the petitioner attempted to seek

13
14

access tc the proceedings.

On the first occasion, in

15

October of 1981, prior to the commencement of the jury

16

selection process, petitioner made an oral and written

17

motion to allow the public access to the voir dire

18

proceedings.
We did so because we had faced this issue

19
20

before in other departments of the same court.

The

21

courts in our county and indeed in the state of

22

California had been closing the courtroom during the

23

voir dire as a result of the case of Hovey versus

24

Superior Court handed down by the California Supreme

25

Court.

that the case of Hovey versus Superior Court did not

10

require closure in order to carry out the mandate of the

11

California Supreme Court in this regard.

12

to the court on October 19th, 1981, and at the

13

conclusion of the hearing, the court made some comments

14

which appear in the record and in the joint appendix.

15

Those comments were generally to the effect that the

16

court believed that the general voir dire should remain

17

open, and that the death-qualifying voir dire should be

18

closed .

19

We argued that

However, the court went on thereafter, after

20

the entreaties of the defense counsel, to indicate that

21

there should be other portions of the voir dire that

22

would possibly be closed.

The court went on to say that regarding

3

individual voir dire» the court "reserved jurisdiction

4

to permit something further than death qualification."

5

The court then proceeded to the selection of the jury as

6

indicated with three days, three days of open voir dire

7

and six weeks of closed voir dire.

QUESTION*

Is that fairly typical in capital

cases in California?
KB. WARD;

Unfortunately, Hr. Chief Justice,

11

the length of time for selecting of juries has grown by

12

leaps and bounds in California.

13
14

QUESTION;

I take it California lets the

lawyers do it.

15

HR. WARD*

That is correct, Your Honor.

16

The fact of the matter is, counsel’s --

17

respondent's brief referred to one case, a case in which

18

we petitioned for cert to this Court, involving

19

selection of a jury involving six months.

20

At the conclusion of the argument, the court

verbalized that "the right of privacy of the jurors," t

limited.

On that basis, petitioner's request for access

QUESTION:

13

Neither of those rights are in the

14

Constitution, are they, either of them, the juror’s

15

right to privacy or the public's right to now?
ME. WARD:

16
17
18

I agree with that, Justice

Rehnquist.
On the third occasion, on February 23rd, 1982,

19

after the defendant had been tried, convicted, and

sentenced to death --

QUESTION:

Did you agree there is no right to

MB. WARD:

QUESTION:

I think you might as well sit down

Will you read the- passage that

Or cite it to us?

ME. WARD*

I cannot. Justice — Mr. Chief

6

Justice, at this point in time, cite the passage from

7

the Constitution.

8

unfortunately, concerned with the utilization or the use

9

of the words "right to know."

I think we are not, fortunately or

It was a passage utilized

10

by the court during the explanation of its rationale for

11

having closed the courtroom, and I was only referring to

12

its utilization of terms which were perhaps

13

inappropriate in the circumstances, for instance,

14

calling upon a right of privacy, which separately is

15

undefined, or at least ill-defined as it pertains to

16

jurors at this point in time.

17

On the third occasion when we tried to secure

18

access, we made an ex parte motion to get the release of

19

the transcript, and once again, the court refused.

20

that time the court indicated that most of the

21

information was "dull and boring," and some of the

22

jurors had, to quote the court, "some special

23

experiences in sensitive areas that do not appear to be

24

appropriate for public discussion."

25

At

When the Court of Appeal in California and the

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Supreme Court of California refused our petitions, we

2 came to this Court on certiorari.
3

The voir dire proceedings is, of course, what

4

we are concerned with here.

The respondent in its

5

briefs has conceded that the voir dire is a part of the

6

trial.

This acknowledgement by the respondent does net,

7 of course, eliminate the issue. The trial courts in

8 California have been closing the voir dire, as
9

previously indicated, ignoring the admonitions of this

10 Court regarding the right of access to public
11

procee dings.
We feel that it is necessary for this Court to

12
13

make a firm pronouncement that the principle set forth

14

in Richmond Newspapers, reaffirmed in Gold Newspaper,

15

apply to the proceedings in connection with the

16

selection of the jury.
We would point to the fact that the voir dire,

17
18

as with the evidence taking portion of the trial, has

19

been historically an open process.
QUESTION:

20

We would —

You would think, I gather, that

21

your First Amendment right would be satisfied even if

22

you were excluded from the voir dire proceeding itself

23

if a transcript of that proceeding were made available

24

to you?

25

NR. WARD:

Nc, Justice Rrennan, we would not

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

be satisfied with exclusion from the proceedings itself.

2

The transcript is, at best, a second best alternative.

3

Functionally, all of the reasoning of this

4

Court that has been applied to the value of the open

5

trial process applies specifically to the open voir dire

6

process as well.
In order for the court below to close the

7
8

courtroom in such circumstances, of course, the court

9

should have articulated on the record findings that

10

absent closure there was a substantial probability of

11

irreparable harm to a compelling interest, that no less

12

restrictive alternatives to closure were available when

13

closure would effectively protect against the perceived

14

harm.
Petitioner feels that the remarks of the court

15
16

and the brief statement in the one written minute order

17

were inadequate to constitute articulated findings in

18

this regard.

19

that there was no compelling interest which under any

20

circumstances would justify closure in this case.

I'.ore particularly, it is our contention

'Respondents advance two rationales.

21

One is

22

the Hovey decision, and second, the rights of juror

23

privacy.

24

contention that the Hovey case does not call for

25

closure.

As to the Hovey decision, it is strongly our

Hovey versus Superior Court was a decision of

i

1

the California Supreme Court which, so far as it

2

pertains to these proceedings, involved the

3

interrogation of prospective jurors in a capital case.

4

The Hovey mandate was decided based upon a single study

5

by an assistant professor of psychology of a group of

6

some 67 persons who viewed films of simulated voir dire

7

proceedings.

8
9

This was not a study of the impact of the
public and the press upon the venire.

There is no

10

mention of that in the study nor in the opinion itself.

11

It was a study of the impact of the answers of the

12

venire persons one upon another.

13

that members of a venire in such a case were impacted by

14

the procedures then in use in California, and there was

15

a tendency to create a predisposition in those jurors

16

towards capital punishment.

The study concluded

17

Accepting the findings of the psychological

18

study as sound, the California Supreme Court mandated

19

that all courts in the state during the death qualifying

20

questioning of jurors should question those prospective

21

jurors, to use the court's words, "individually and in

22

seques tration.”

23

The court, however, made a clear statement in

24

the opinion that the ruling should not impact upon the

25

openness of the trial.

The public defender of the state

proceedings.

that the Hovey decision does not require court closure.

The public defender was, of course —

QUESTION;

Mr. Ward, do you think that

1

prospective jurors do have any rights concerning

2

questions that may be of a very personal or private

3

nature to have the process closed that have to be

4

considered by the trial court?

5

MB. WARD;

Assuming for the moment, Justice

6

O'Connor, that there is some right of the juror to

7

refrain from responding to a question for whatever

8 reason similar to the ones that you may have posited
9

there,

the fact remains that I can conceive of no

10

circumstance why it would be necessary to close the

11

courtroom in order to solve that problem for the juror,

2

because there are reasonable alternatives available to

3

the court to avoid any damage to any perceived right of

4

the juror in those circumstances.

5

QUESTION;

Such as what alternatives?

6

MR. WARD;

The most obvious being, of course,

7

that the court could excuse

the juror before invading

8

any perceived right of privacy, because the defendant

9

has the right to a fair and impartial juror and a fair

20

and impartial jury, but not to a specific juror.

a process of random selection in any event, and it is a

matter, even as respondent's brief has pointed out, is a

23

It is

5

There is no reason to retain a juror whose rights would

point remains that the process can remain open, because

14

Hr. Ward, in some systems, as you

Would you say that questionnaire must be

available to the press, since it is in effect part of

25

MR. WARD:

It would be my position, yes, that

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

the questionnaires, being part of the process, should be

2

available to the press, but if I may elaborate on that,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the use of

4

questionnaires is one of those less restrictive

5

alternatives that could help us avoid the problem with

6

the juror and yet permit the public access to the

7

proceedings, because I submit that if we are dealing

8

with a case, one of the more common sensitive areas with

9

which we are concerned is, for instance, sexual

10

preferences, and if the questionnaires were directed in

11

such a way to elicit from jurors whether any of them

12

harbored any feelings or had any problems in these

13

areas,

14

juror's rights in that regard, and we believe that

15

questionnaires is indeed one of the very viable, less

16

restrictive alternatives that would be available to the

17

court.

18

it could be resolved short of offending any

QUESTIONS

But if it is available, if, as you

19

say, that questionnaire should be available to the

20

media, then where is the protection of the privacy?

21

MB. WARD;

The protection arrives, Your Honor,

22

in connection with the use of careful questioning, and

23

the judge at the trial level controlling the court can

24

see to it that the questioning does not offend areas of

25

potential privacy or sensitivity if they exist.

6

The fact is, though, that the Hovey decision

7

potentially is being read by the courts as calling for

9

the Supreme Court of the state of Kentucky sc

10

interpreted the case in a recent, very recent decision

11

where it said that the defendants in the state of

12

California have the right tc a closed voir dire.

13

Now, if the case is read that way, it violates

14

this Court's decision in Glebe, because it is then a

15

mandate requiring closure, and we submit that this case,

18

Hovey versus Superior Court, is no different than a

17

statute such as the type that you interpreted, the

18

Massachusetts statute in the Globe case.

11

for openness, and the rationale for openness of

trial,

14

Well, suppose in this case instead

of it being voir dire, it had been a motion the day

before it was set for trial for a continuance, at which

both sides were going to present witnesses, and then the

19

trial judge felt there was a fair amount of reason for

20

closing that because the witnesses might touch on some

21

sensitive matters.

22

Now, would you feel that under the principle

MR. SALTERs

that the newspaper did not point cut at the time of

ME. WALTERS

It is related to the problem of

peremptory challenges, yes.

3

California was the Edwards case, which limited your voir

for cause, in challenge for cause.

6

found that that rule was honored more in its breach, and

so it decided that appropriately you could inquire into

areas dealing with the issue of laying bases for

peremptory challenges.

MR. SALTERj

Basically that's true.

One cf

15

the cases that the Williams case cited dealt with the

16

issue of a rape case, and could ycu inquire cf the

17

jurors whether they had had similar experiences, and the

18

said, no, you couldn't, but it is quite clear now that

under the Williams case, you can ask those questions in

would not, I believe, wish to respond to, whether they

had been perhaps sexually abused or sexually assaulted.

It is a legitimate area of inquiry.

MR. SALTER!

3

I believe it is 26, although they

are allowed to augment.

4

Speaking back to ycur question as to whether

5

or not there are any alternatives, I don't believe the

6

juror questionnaires solves that particular problem

7

because, as Mr. Chief Justice Burger pointed out, the

newspaper would want tc have those made public, and so

it would not make any difference therefore whether ycu QUESTION:

community would be that if the public is allowed tc come

types of questions or the responses given who those

in a smaller community, but you can# and the newspapers

You can know who those people might be.

the question still comes out.
They offered an alternative of screening

11
12

questions.

Cnee again, I think you have a similar

13

problem with your questionnaires.

14

have you or anyone in your family ever been sexually

15

abused, it is very difficult to either — to screen that

16

question or to rephrase that question in a way that does

17

not require the prospective juror to provide the same

18

basic information.

If the question is,

19

And so I do not believe that that provides any

20

real alternative, because when you are talking about the

21

issue of privacy, it is the nature, it is the answer

22

which is more important than it is the question.

23

I also do not believe that excusing jurors who

24

say — or who describe — or who refrain from describing

25

intimate information is really, once again, a viable

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

alternative, especially if that is done in open court.

2

It is not at all unusual for one juror to see another

3

juror offer an excuse, and have the trial judge allow

4

that juror to he let go.

5

A prospective juror who does not wish to serve

6

will simply mimic that excuse, and so you have the

7

problem of being able to effectively deal with the jury

8

panel which is actually in the court itself, and to

9

effectively ask each one questions and be certain that

10

you are getting valid responses and that they will net

11

offer you simply excuses to avoid their jury duty and

12

their public duty.

13

MR. SALTER;

hr. Salter, I find that argument

14

rather strange.

You are implying that most members of

15

the panel will give false excuses when under oath during

2

The primary rationale of Hovey

3

does not require closure per se, but when you deal with

4

Hovey on a lengthy basis, you have a lengthy voir dire,

5

I think at that particular point, during the time the

6

voir dire is taking place, it is quite appropriate for

7

the court to close it so that the questions, the

8

responses, the issues which are dealt with do not become

9

part of the record for prospective jurors who might not

10

at that particular point be called.
Obviously, on a five-month voir dire it is

11
12

quite possible that there are people out there who will

13

not have been called at the time the case started but

14

may very well read of the case and read of the

So at that point that is very crucial and

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

This is a

closure case.

We do not believe it is an appropriate

21

case for deciding right of juror privacy. Net only is it

22

a case devoid of any record regarding the matter of
