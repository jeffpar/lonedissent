Illinois public school teacher against its employer, the

12

board

More specifically, in final analysis this is a breach cf

QUESTION;

Well,

I would think you would apply

1

to a tenured teacher.

2

MR. FILLER;

It wculd, except for the

3

statutory provision found in Section 24.12 which

4

specifically says that a ter.ured teacher must le

5

dismissed for specific cause.

6

QUESTION;

V;e 11 then, what alout the prevision

7

that says you may dismiss a probationary teacher if you

8

give him 60 days notice before the end of his first

9

year?
MR. MILLER;

10

That prevision, of course, I

11

think

has been interpreted to mean the nonrenewal aspect

12

of a probationary teacher’s contract.

13

that person will serve cut that first year and his

14

contract will not be renewed for a second year.

In other words,

Under the statutory scheme, unless that

15
16

nonrenewal notice is given the teacher is automatically

17

re-employed for the second year.

18

Right.

19

MR. MILLER;

I think that can be gleaned from

He assumed there was some kind cf a

6

UR. FILLER*

That’s correct..

7

The district court, after a tench trial, made

8

the following findings which are pertinent to this

9

case:

10

First of all, that the Respondent teacher had

11

executed a cne-year employment contract with the beard

12

cf education.

13

Secondly, that a consensus of the beard cf

14

education, a consensus of the board, had premised, and

15

made the premise through an oral representation cf the

16

superintendent to the teacher, that his contract would

17

be renewed at the end cf the first contract year.

that representation was made at the time cf initial

employment.

Another finding was that the Petitioners in

3

fact did notify the Respondent cn Farch the 3rd,

4

that his contract would net he renewed, and that renewal

5

without irore did meet the strict requirements of the

6

probationary nonrenewal notice provisions of the school

QUESTION:

You have said you were commenting

17

on the district court's findings.

I take it new you're

18

going to kind of a narrative account of what happened?

19

MR. KILLER:

Yes.

20

In addition to the findings made by the

21

district court, the district ccurt also made certain

22

conclusions of law, which I think are important also.

23

The district ccurt concluded that cn the basis of the

24

representation that was made at the time of employment

25

that the board of education had bound itself to a

13

QUESTION;

I dc, and I will address that.
You have a fairly touch row to hoe

14

in this Court, I suppose ycu realize,

15

the district judge is cbvicusly formerly an Illinois

16

lawyer and three judges of the Court of Appeals did not

17

take issue with that finding.

18

ME. VILLEE;

tecause, you know,

This is true, except I think that

19

this Court has the opportunity to take a lock at

20

Illinois law in this case because cf the fact that net

22

provision, that being Section 2U-11.

required to interpret that.

MR. MILLER:

if it were properly applied

I think that the state law issue

certainly does come into play when we get into --

QUESTION:

You certainly don't need tc win on

6

that tc win this case, do you?

7

MR. MILLER:

No, I don't believe I do.

Rut I

8

think

that the state law issue comes into play quite

9

significantly when we talk abcut the property right,

10

because as we knew freir this Court's prior decisions,

11

property rights, particularly property riahts in

12

employment, are created by sta^e law and net the

13

Ccnstitution.
And I realize that T have a tough row tc hce

14
15

when it comes tc this Court locking at state law.

16

this is one of the points that we have raised, and we

17

think

18

the opportunity, had this case been filed in the state

19

court system, that it would have held that Section 24-11

20

does net allow for mere than two successive cne-year

21

term contracts.

And we say that primarily on the strength that

QUESTION*

Well, Nr. Miller, what if the heard

2

had given 73il the initial cne-year contract, but at the

3

same time had given him the statutory notice that he’d

4

be re-employed for another year at the end of the first

Wouldn't that have given him a valid two-year

QUESTIONs

11

Well, the point is just that it

12

doesn't seem inconsistent with the previsions of the

13

statute as they’re set out.

14

that they can’t have a twl-year contract is essentially

15

a w ea k one.
uE. MIILEFi

16

Sc I think the argument

Sell, the history of the Illinois

17

Supreme Court in interpreting the tenure previsions has

18

been that the court has strictly construed these

19

provisions dealing with nontenure! teachers and in fact

20

has given a tremendous amount of flexibility to beards

21

of education in dealing with the nontenured teachers.
QUESTIONS

22

Nr. Miller, you've used up more

23

than a

third of your time and you haven’t really gotten

24

to the

heart of your case yet.

25

MB. MIILEF:

As

I would suggest tc the Court,

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-S300

1

there are four points cn which I think this Court can

2

reverse this case.

3

move on again into the ether points.

4

The first we have discussed.

I will

The second is that under the Illinois

5

statutory scheme a probationary contract is net a

6

property interest within the meaning of the Constitution

7

and Section 19 6 3/ and I say that because there is r.c

8

fcr-cause standard for discharge found in Section

9

10-22.4, that being the stututcry prevision that sets

10

forth

11

teacher for.

12

when a board can or what a board can dismiss a

It is our reading cf this Court's cases, Fcth

13

and Pishcp, that a for-cause standard is necessary

14

within

15

property interest which is protected by the

16

Constitution .

17

QUESTION;

This Is only slightly different

18

from your first argument, it seems to me,

19

really saying that if he had sued in state court he

20

would he met with your point that there was no breach of

21

contract because we can fire for no cause at all.

22

KP. FIILEFi

23

QUESTION :

because you're

That's correct.
And that seems to me to be contrary

24

to the state law finding by the district judge and the

25

Court cf Appeals.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

MF. KILLEF;

1

2

I separate the issue cf whether

you can have a two-year contract —
QUESTION;

3

I knew you're talking about it in

4

two different paragraphs, tut it sounds like almost the

5

same argument.

But go ahead.

MR. MILLEF;

6

Well, the important point here I

7

think is that this Court's decisions place a great deal

8

of importance on state law interpretation, and in this

9

case we have net had the benefit cf that analysis

10

because we have not had a state court,

whether it he an

11

appellate court or the supreme court, address either the

12

issue cf the legality cf a two-year term probationary

13

contract nor whether, if that is authorized, that term

14

contract constitutes preperty within the meaning cf the

15

Constitution .

16

And if I read this Court's decisions

17

correctly, it's that state court determination that this

18

Court must rely on in regard to the judgmental call as

19

to whether a preperty interest is involved

20

case.

in this

The third point which I wish to address is

21

22

that,

even if there is a preperty interest under state

23

law, there has been no deprivation of 3 right secured by

24

the Constitution.

25

remedy in this case is for money damages.

I say that because the Fespcndert's
Under

1

Illinois law the Respondent has no right tc specific

2

performance.

3

is successful in his litigation.

4

He has a right tc recover lost pay if he

We suggest that there has teen nc final

5

deprivation cf a right in this case because of the fact

6

that until or unless the state would foreclose his

7

opportunity to bring suit ir. the state courts tc seek

8

redress, that being for money damages, there has been nc

9

de p riv a tio n .

10

Another point which T wish tc make --

11

QUESTION;

Would ycu feel differently abcut

12

that if the contract were specifically enforceable under

13

Illinois law?

14

proper ty?

15

Wculd ycu think then it would constitute

ME. MILLER ;

That would be akin to the

16

previsions in Section 24-12 which allow for

17

reinstatement cf a tenured teacher who would be

18

discharged and found that the discharge was not

19

approp riate.

20
21

QUESTION:

Would that be a protectable

property interest?

22

ME. MILLIE:

23

QUESTION;

In my judgment it vculd be.
Let me ask you abcut your

24

deprivation argument.

If ycu assume he had a contract

25

right and pursuant to that contract he was getting a

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

check every week or every month or whatever it was, and

2

then the heard took action and he stepped getting that

3

check and nobody else did anything after that, you say

4

he's net been deprived of anything.

5

getting the money any more.

6

MR. MILLERs

He's just not

That’s cur analysis of the

7

deprivation issue, is that his deprivation takes place

8

if the state were to foreclose him from bringing an

9

action fer the collection cf that salary that is due him

10

in a breach of contract case.

11

QUESTION*

That sounds more like an argument

12

that he’s got adequate process available.

13

me when he steps getting his money there’s been a

14

deprivation.

15

that's not a deprivation.

16

that.

17

It seems to

I don't cuite understand how you can say
Nobody doer anything after

It’s a rather dramatic change ir circumstances.
MR. MILLER:

I must grant that the deprivation

18

concept dovetails into the due process analysis also,

19

because one of the tests that this Court has set forth

20

when you must determine whether there has teen a

21

violation of due process or due process without law is

22

if the deprivation is final.

23

.And that brings me to my final point which I

24

care to make.

I think that on the strength of the Ferry

25

case and the Logan case decided by this Court that the

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Respondent Vail clearly has an adequate state law

2

remedy .

3

for breach of contract.

4

h’e has a comir.cn law remedy in the state cctrts

And as I read the Logan case, if that common

5

law remedy will make the Respondent whole,

6

would

7

entitled to money damages, then the state law remedy is

8

adequate and there has been no due process violation.

QUESTION;

You’re saying that if they notified

him that he was terminated, he was being terminated, and

11

said,

to litigate with you in the local courts,

He was not terminated on the spot.

Sc ys=s, he could have brought the suit, but

no, the Illinois state court would net have enjoined the

19

QUESTION:

20

You mean they couldn’t have

enjoined the board of education?
MR. HILLER;

21

That’s correct, because under

22

Illinois law he has an adequate remedy for damages, and

23

that is the appropriate remedy for a breach of

24

contra ct.

25

QUESTION;

And the only remedy of a

MR. MILLER:

3

I will reserve the time I have remaining.

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes, sir.

You never get around to your fourth

point, did you?

6

MR. MILLER:

My fourth point, Justice White,

7

was a combination cf the deprivation and due process

8

analysis and, as I've suggested to the Court, because of

9

the state law remedy there has teen no denial cf due

CRAL ARGUMENT OF MARC J. ANSEL, ESQ.

13

ON EEKALF CE FESFONEEM

14
15

Mr. Ansel.

MR. ANSEL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

16

The issue in this case is whether or not an

17

employee of state government who is discharged in the

18

middle cf his term without reasons or an explanation is

19

entitled to these reasons ard an opportunity to respond

20

at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.

21

The Petitioners*

argument in this case reduces

22

to two basic propositions:

23

federal claim because there is no state claim; number

24

two, there is no federal claim because there is a state

25

claim.

Number one, there is no

This inherent inconsistency in the argument

provides no help in balancing the many interests that

2

have to be weighed in a due process analysis.
CUESTICN;

3

Kr. Ansel, what elements cf your

4

client's case other than the final constitutional

5

framing cf it come from any place ether than Illinois

6

law?
NR. ANSEL;

7

In fact, none of the elements cf

8

the protectable interest come from any place but

9

Illinois law.
CUESTI0Ni

10
11

Sc it's really a diversity case

without diversity.
ME. ANSEL;

12

Kell, it is mere than a diversity

13

case, only because cf the question of whether he was

14

entitled to a hearing or seme type cf pre-deprivaticr

15

process under the Constitution.

16

and that question is net a question cf Illinois contract

17

law.

18

That is what changes it

This is a constitutional question.
CUESTION;

But all of the analysis that gees

19

into deciding whether he has what you refer to as a

20

protectable property interest depends entirely on

21

Illinois contract law, doesn't it?

22

HR. ANSEL;

I think fer the purposes of this

23

case I can rely on

the findings of the two lower courts

24

and say that it does, because that is all that is

25

necessary tc reach the heart cf this case, which is what

1°

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

process is actually due, given a protectable interest.

2

This case involves a claim against a school district,

3

which is a government employer, and in the case the

4

Respondent proved an explicit commitment from the

5

highest governing authorities and a breach cf that

6

commitment.

7

This could be termed, and it has teen termed,

8

a scuatlle between a teacher and a school beard in the

9

dissent below.

But in constitutional terms, this

10

epitomizes the arbitrary actions that are occasionally

11

committed by state government without any adequate

12

remedy .

13

QUESTION:

Well, Mr.

Ansel,

dc you agree that

14

the only remedy provided under Illinois law for a breach

15

is a damages action --

HR. ANSEL:

QUESTION:

18

HR. ANSEL;

19

20

That is correct.
-- for a nen-tenured teacher?
That is the only remedy provided

by 111 inois law .
QUESTION:

And you also agree that Illinois

21

did not provide for a hearing before the notice cf

22

termination as a matter of state law?

23

HR. ANSEI:

QUESTION:

25

That is correct.

reasonableness of the reliance by a probationary teacher

on those processes?

2

probationary teacher have a right to expect mere than

3

the Illinois law provided in that regard?

4

MR. ANSEL:

In other words, why would a

I think that the absence cf an

5

explicit provision in Illinois law for a hearing dees

6

not mean that a hearing could net be provided.

7

constitutional question is whether or net a deprivation

9

11

Eut the

pre-deprivaticn hearing.
QUESTION;

Well, isn’t it possible at least

12

that the notion cf a property interest protectable under

13

the Fourteenth Amendment should turn at least in part on

14

the reasonableness of the owner’s reliance on whatever

15

entitlement he has?

16

MR. ANSEL:

Yes,

I think it should, and in

17

this case the reliance, based on every fact in the

18

record, would be a reasonable reliance.

19

QUESTION;

Well, but if under state law he’s

20

net entitled tc a hearing, why is it reasonable tc

21

expectr it?

22

ME. ANSEL:

It’s reasonable to expect a

23

hearing because hearings are provided for all teachers

24

that are terminated in the middle of their terms,

25

because cause is an element of that termination.

The

1

Petitioner:, when he indicated those reasons that cctld

2

constitute termination in the middle of a term, even a

3

reason as amorphous as the interests of the district,

4

still is sufficient to generate a cause requirement.

5

QUESTION:

Well,

you’re arguing that as a

6

matter of constitutional law that’s so, but certainly

7

net as a matter of state law.

8

MR. ANSEL;

9

That is correct.

I

think that the

cases in this Court have indicated that if somebody is

10

provided with a protectable interest as determined by

11

reference tc state law the question of whether the

12

procedures are sufficient tc deprive them of that

13

interest is a constitutional question.

14

recently stated in the legan case.
QUESTION:

15

This was most

Mr. Ansel, a moment ago you said

16

that Illinois gave no adequate remedy tc your client.

17

Would your client have had a damages remedy under

18

Illinois law?
MR. ANSEL:

19
20

I believe that he would have had

damages remedy under Illinois law.
QUESTION:

21

Well, since that’s all that the

22

district court gave him, was damages, why wasn’t his

23

remedy under Illinois law every bit as adequate as it

24

was in

25

the district court?
MR. ANSEL:

QUESTION;

6

Sc really you feel your remedy in

ME. ANSEL;

I think that that is true, and the

7

reason is more complicated than might first appear.

first reason is, by the time the case was able to be

15

He had begun to lock for

They had already hired another employee.

Put this case is limited to those

16

circum stances because the interest remaining at the time

17

was only one year, and the realities cf litigation even

18

in federal court are such that it's sometimes impossible

1

to obtain complete restoration of what is lost when that

20

deprivation takes place.

21

QUESTION;

If damages is all he could get, I

22

suppose any public employer can illegally fire a person ,

16

I’m not saying that the Constitution requires Illinois

remedies and the question of whether or net they are

the one year that he had remaining as an expectancy, the

realities of federal litigation and the limits of his

In any event, the adequacy of a
