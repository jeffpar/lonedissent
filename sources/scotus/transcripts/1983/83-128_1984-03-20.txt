Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

In this case the Court has under review a

judgment of the Ninth Circuit reversing respondents'

convictions for brutal murders committed while they were

11

inmates at the Federal correctional institution in

12

Lompoc, California, and ordering dismissal of the

13

indictments against them on the ground that they were

14

denied

15

counsel when they were held in administrative detention

16

for more than 90 days after the killings,

by the Gouveia group of defendants.
And in Kills there was one trial after the

convicted and appealed.

In Gouveia there was a trial

primary and one secondary issue.

The primary issue is

whether respondents' right to counsel under the Sixth

Amendment attached prior to the time of the commencement

20

of judicial proceedings against them by indictment.
If this Court disagrees with the Ninth Circuit

21

and finds, as we urge,

that the right to counsel did not

23

attach prior to that time, that would be the end of the

24

case.

further question as to whether there was a sufficient

2

showing of prejudice.
QUESTION:

3
4

Excuse me, Nr. Frey.

The time of

indictment is the time for appointment?
NR. FREY:

5

In this particular case, the time

6

of indictment is the time that we say that the right of

7

appointment of counsel attaches, the right to assistance

8

of counsel and for indigents appointment of counsel.
Now given the time limitations,

9

I'd like to

10

focus my attention in my opening argument on the primary

11

issue of the attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to

12

counse1.
Now the first and most obvious point about the

13
14

attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is

15

that it does derive from the Sixth Amendment, and the

16

Sixth

17

accused shall enjoy the right to the assistance of

18

counsel.

19

can say is a criminal prosecution before, I think, the

20

Court can legitimately say that the right defined in the

21

Sixth

Amendment says in any criminal prosecution the

There must be, then,

something that the Court

Amendment has attached.
The second obstacle to respondents' position

22
23

and the Court of Appeals position is that this Court has

24

a consistent line of decisions in which it has

25

recognized

the significance of the need for their to be

6

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

a prosecution in existence, and it has in the context of

2

Miranda as against Massiah rights or in the context of

3

whether a lineup without counsel claim or presents a due

4

process or a right to counsel claim, it has consistently

5

looked at the question whether there is some kind cf

6

charge against the defendant charging him with the crime

7

filed in a court somewhere.
Of course, in this case there is nothing

8

remotely like that.

The sole exception to this line of

10

cases is the Escobedo case, which the Court has

11

subsequently held to be limited to its facts and plainly

12

rejected in its rationale in the later decisions.
And I would just point out 3bout Escobedo that

13
14

that was a case that at least directly involved an

15

interference by the police between the defendant and his

16

retained counsel, who was down at the station house

QUESTION:

Out in the hallway.

20

MR. FREYi

So it's understandable, perhaps,

21

that the Court thought the right to counsel would be

22

relevant there, although I think subsequently

23

doctrinally it's become quite clear that it wasn't.

24
25

Now, as I said, there is no dispute in this
case that there was nothing resembling a formal judicial

4

I think, fairly clear and fairly easy to

The Court of Appeals, however, has basically

5

thrown

us into seas of uncertainty by developing a

6

concept of the functional equivalency of a prosecution

7

or an accusation, and stating that "whether a person

8

stands accused" — and I'm quoting from their opinion -"can only be determined from the totality of the

10

circumstances."

Mow I hope this Court will decline the

11

invitation to set sail in these murky waters.
Now let's — let me talk for a minute about

12

13

what the Court of Appeals thought would satisfy the

14

Sixth

It held that the retention in administrative

18

detention unit for more than 90 days, where part of the

1

reason for that detention is the pendency of a criminal

20

investigation.

21

perhaps fearing that the Court would find the breadth of

22

that rule somewhat difficult to accept, have proposed a

23

considerably narrower principle.

Now respondents Mills and Pierce,

24

They assert that the rule of the Ninth Circuit

25

is only that where people are detained more than 90 days

some c ontroversy over exactly what the record shows or

There was no claim that they were deprived of

1

and there was really no focus during the hearings on the

2

pretrial motions on the question of why they were being

3

det ain ed, although there was considerable focus in both

4

c a s es on the cense quence-s of detention in terms of the

5

difficulty of ultimately mounting a defense.
The result is that the record contains very

6
7

little as to why they were detained, but it does contain

8

forms that state that the reason that they were detained
was for the security of the institution and the safety

10

of inmates within the institution.

Some of those forms

11

also indicate that they were -- there are boxes that can

12

be checked off and the pendency of a criminal

13

investigation was also a reason given on those forms.
Now, when the case went up to the panel of the

14
15

Court of Appeals on the government's appeal, that was

16

the first time that this question of why they were being

17

detained, whether it was for security purposes or

18

others, was brought into focus by' the parties, and at

1

that point the panel simply said the evidence shows that

20

they were kept in for security purposes.
And, more than that -- and this is a point

21
22

where

I think the Court of

Appeals made a fundamental

23

error — the Court of Appeals misconstrued the Bureau's

24

regulations and the regulation that's relevant is at

25

Section 541.22 of Title 28, CFR.

10

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

10

These regulations mean that an inmate cannot

11

be held in administrative detention except where there

12

is a finding that releasing him into the general

13

population would be inconsistent with the security of

14

the institution.

15

is inmates who are in transit from one institution to

16

another and are being held waiting for the next bus, and

17

they can be held and customarily are in administrative

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey --

MR. FREY:

So the one thing that T think

10

clearly was not going to happen ever with these people

11

was to return them to the general population at Lompoc.
QUESTION:

12

May I ask you, you make a very

13

major point cut of the reason for* the detention being

14

security rather than investigation.

15

before us be different if it were for investigative

16

purposes after the 90 days?

Would the issue

17

MR. FREY:

No, of course —

18

QUESTION:

The issue — I mean, is this

1

critical to your case?
MR. FREY:

20

Let me put it this way.

Certainly

21

in our view it is not critical to our case.

In our

22

view,

23

of the Court clearly support it -- is there has to be in

24

some court somewhere something that resembles a charge

25

of a crime before the Sixth Amendment attaches, and all

our first argument -- and we think the precedents

12

of the rest of this is irrelevant -- functional

2

equivalent analysis or symbolic --

3

QUESTION*

It seems to me your argument would

4

be very relevant if there were a suit for damages for

5

being detained for too long or something like that, but

6

under your Sixth Amendment analysis I'm not quite sure

7

why it makes any difference why they were detained.

8
9
10

11

MR. FREY:

Well, I am responding to the

rationale of the Court of Appeals and the rationale of
my brother who you will hear from.
QUESTION:

But your central response, as I

12

understand it, is that no Sixth Amendment right attaches

13

no matter what the reason for the detention.

14

MR. FREY:

That is true, but I am now in this

15

portion of the argument trying to address the question

16

whether if there were a some functional equivalency or

17

symbolic accusation rationale that would be acceptable,

18

whether this case would satisfy the requirement.

Well, these prisoners weren’t going

anywhere anyway, were they?

Now there is, I think, some language that is

the attachment of Sixth Amendment rights, but what Kirby

2

is relevant to is a somewhat different point.

3

The respondents have a quite different reason

4

for saying the Sixth Amendment attached here, and that

5

is a reason that says it would be awfully helpful to

have a lawyer in terms of preparing a defense.

One thing he might do, as sometimes

happens, he negotiates a plea agreement, so the whole

HR. FREY:

There is such a thing as —

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-M00

1

pre-indictment plea negotiation does go on, not in a

2

case like this.

3

I don't think that's very practical.

What -- in the real world, what happens is

4

it’s very important to have that indictment or

5

information or charge because that's when the lawyer

6

knows what the government's case is.

7

does get some discovery, gets physical evidence.

8

gets his client's prior statements.

At that point he
He

If he starts doing a very active investigation
10

before then, one of the reasons why it's not common is

11

he may only put himself in a position where he is

12

handicapped in representing his client once he knows

13

what the government is actually "charging him with and

14

what his case is.

15

So even where the Sixth Amendment right to

16

counsel attaches for purposes of a preliminary hearing,

17

a ball hearing, and so on, it is simply not the fact

18

that the lawyer immediately goes out and starts

1

investigating the case.

20

may or may not be helpful.

They may or they may not.

Our position here does not depend on any

conclusion that it would have been useless to these

respondents to have lawyers, but I think they greatly

24

exaggerate the value that it would have been to them.

Now I wanted also to make just one other

24

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

point, which is that their emphasis on the utility of a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES P. DIAMOND, FSQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

5

6
7

MR. DIAMOND;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
In the time alloted to me to address the right

8

to counsel issue I would like to make four principal

9

points concerning the decision below.

10

First, the decision does not limit the right

11

of the government to order an inmate into segregated

12

confinement or to hold him there indefinitely.

13

simply recognizes that under limited circumstances an

14

inmate can be rendered an accused by that confinement

15

and under limited circumstances is entitled to counsel.

16

The government does not point to any adverse

17

conseguences which could flow from that decision.

18

Point two, the decision of the Court of

It

19

Appeals fully accommodates the interests of the

20

government in responding promptly to disruptive events.

21

Indeed , it only pertains to those who have been held

22

under Bureau of Prisons* own regulations to answer in a

23

pending criminal indictment.

24
25

In that respect,

the decision of the Court of

Appeals is far less rigorous than standards that have

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 820-0300

1

been promulgated by the American Bar Association and

2

other legal groups.
Point three.

3

The Court of Appeals did not

4

require the appointment of counsel for all inmates

5

confined in aimistrative detention for more than 90

e

days.

7

this case concerns only inmates who have been detained

8

to answer in pending criminal charges and thus who in a

9

constitutional sense have been accused of a crime.

Contrary to what Hr. Frey says about this case,

Point four.

10

The decision below does not

11

represent any radical departure from anything.

It

12

simply stands for the proposition that those arrested

13

within the walls of a prison are as much entitled to

14

legal

15

the walls of an institution.

representation as those who are arrested outside

16

In light of Mr. Frey’s comments,

17

diverge from the order in which I was going to cover

18

these points and plunge right into the constitutional

19

basis for what the Court of Appeals did.

20

goes to the third point that I wanted to cover this

21

morning in that the Court of Appeals recognized a right

22

to counsel only in inmates who have been held in a

23

constitutional sense because they have been accused of a

24

crime.

25

I’d like to

Mr. Diamond, Kirby was arrested,

22

different than this case is that he was not detained to

MR. DIAMOND;

Justice Rehnguist, they're not

2

at all inconsistent, and let me explain why.

3

first state that the reason the Court of Appeals found

4

these individuals entitled to counsel or at least

5

accused in a constitutional sense was because they were

6

detained to be held to answer in a pending charge.

What was the situation --

21

But I would like to deal with Justice Stewart's comments

22

and the result reached by Justice Stewart as they would

apply

24
25

to this case.
Marion tells us that if one is accused in a

constitutional sense, that the Sixth Amendment becomes

QUESTION;

4
5

6

Marion makes clear that What dees that mean -- "holding to

MR. DIAMOND;

A decision to bring the guy into

7

8

home, to hold him there —

9
10
11
12

QUESTION;

That’s just arrest.

MR. DIAMOND;

It's an arrest and a decision to

keep him there until something happens.
QUESTION;

So you say the language in Marion

13

doesn’t mean that he's being held to answer a charge

14

that’s been filed?

15

held to answer a charge if it’s ever filed?

16

You think it means that he is being

MR. DIAMOND;

He has been held to answer a

QUESTION;

Well, that’s certainly contrary to

20

the normal meaning of "hold to answer" that we learned,

21

at least we learned in the days when I was in law

school, that being held to answer is going before a

MR. DIAMOND;

2

But, Justice

It is inconceivable you would be

held to answer without there being a charge to which you

4

are held to answer to.

5

MR. DIAMOND;

Justice Rehnguist, I understand

6

the Solicitor General tries to tie the concept of

7

holding to answer into the procedure that we have.
QUESTION;

8
9

Well, I speak out of my experience,

not what the Solicitor General is trying to do.
MR. DIAMOND;

10

I understand that.

But my point

11

is how could Marion have referred to a procedure in

12

which a magistrate determines probable cause and binds

13

someone over when it was decided in 1971 and wasn't

14

until

15

first time recognized that one arrested had a right to

16

go through that process.

17

1975 in Gerstein v. Pugh that this Court for the

Beyond that, what that argument reduces to is

18

that the police can go out on the street and they can

19

throw somebody in the hoosegow, and if they decide not

20

to bring him before a magistrate or, in this case, since

21

the rules don't apply, don’t have to, he has not been

22

held to answer.

23

QUESTION;

Well,

Kirby says that no Sixth

24

Amendment right to counsel is implicated in those

25

circumstances.

Now maybe some other constitutional

MR. DIAMOND;

2

let me attempt to distinguish

3

Kirby,

because I think it is distinguishable from the

4

situation that Marion addressed, it's distinguishable

5

from the situation here.
The problem in Kirby or what happened in Kirby

6
7

was an individual was, Mr. Kirby was taken off the

8

street, largely because the police thought he was

9

somebody else, and he was in possession of, as I recall,

10

11

they thought that was suspicious and they brought him to

12

the station house for further investigation.
They get to the station house and for the

13
14

first time the police learn that the man whose

15

traveler's checks he was carrying was the victim of a

find people who might have known something about the.

11

alternate theories of the murders or who might have

12

known something about the government's witnesses.

13

And to a limited degree we were able to

14

interview some people, but the use of the word "limited

15

degree" is the important distinction here, because we

16

weren’t there until 20 months had expired.

17

the potential witnesses and the use of evidence of an

MR. LEVINE;

2

Justice O’Conner, in response to

3

your question, that comes up in the government’s brief

4

time and time again.

5

There is the allegation that the

Gouveia defendants -- and I participated in that
f

6

trial — called 14 alibi witnesses and 31 witnesses in

7

all to defend themselves.

8
9

That issue came up in the oral argument before
the Ninth Circuit as well,

and I think, it should be

10

pointed out here, as it was pointed out there, you are

11

dealing with 14 alibi witnesses for five different

12

people in a trial, and 35 witnesses or 31 witnesses for

13

five different people, and it*s not the quantity of

14

witnesses alone which should determine whether a person

15

has had an adequate defense.

16

It's the quality of those witnesses.

For

17

example, on behalf of Mr. Segura, who I represented at

18

the trial, I called five people who could be

19

characterized as alibi witnesses, and of those five —

20

and maybe this is just a quantitative or qualitative

21

evaluation of my own -- there was really only one who

22

established his alibi or who attempted to do so.

23

The other persons, their memories were so

24

dimmed by the passage of 20 months,

by that time 27

25

months, that their ability to relate facts to a jury was

comment about this entire case.

When we talk about the

5

plus 99 years in prison, the claims of prejudice begin

6

to get your attention.

when you have six people who are serving life

And in this particular case I think the

7
8

Solicitor General's office is beginning to take a rather

9

inconsistent position when you hear them argue in the

10

case immediately preceding this that it is the

11

goverament's interest to bring people to trial while the

12

evidence is new and the memories of witnesses are clear

13

and in this particular case they seem not to have very

14

much concern for that position, and that's our position.

15

Your Honor.
Unless there are any further questions, T am

QUESTION:

18

Do you think that there are some

19

rather unusual difficulties in investigating this kind

20

of case, as you have said it was for you, and that those

21

difficulties would also attend the government's inquiry

22

to try to get information from these prisoners?
MR. LEVINE:

23

Your Honor, the way one of these

24

cases is typically investigated -- and I know in the

25

brief

that I supplied the Court with I outlined a

in this case, and the dates upon which

they found it.

And I think it's a very, very good

5

up with their evidence in one of these cases.

Of that number of people — and this is in the

11
12

record, too, in Mr. Wilkins’ affidavit, he was the FBI

13

agent — perhaps 98 or 99 percent of those prisoners are

14

going to tell the FBI I know nothing about this case.

15

And they do that because that’s the credo within the

prison .

17

QUESTION:

MR. LEVINE:

There is a one, two

I was in court when Judge Gray dismissed the

Mills case the first time, and those were his comments

10

in dismissing that indictment.

His attitude was well,

11

the government can develop its case right away, and then

12

keep the defendants on hold indefinitely while they have

13

no opportunity to build a defense for themselves.
And here we're dealing with a murder

if there is no right to counsel, when does it end?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MR. FREY;

A couple of things.

I would like

24

to emphasize with Mr. Levine that we are dealing with a

25

murder case here, which makes the seriousness of the

QUESTION;

3
4

How many of these defendants

charged with murdsr had these long life sentences?
MR. FREY;

I think, they all.

T’m not certain

5

what the sentences were.

I assume they all got life

6

sentences for these murders.

7

after the indictment was dismissed and while the

8

government was appealing, his mandatory release date
came up and he was let out.

No, Pierce in fact was,

He robbed some banks in

10

northern California and he's in state custody now.

11

if the mandatory release date comes, this symbolic

12

accusation evaporates and they are let out of prison.

13

So

It's the prison authorities who decide to put

14

them in administrative detention.

It is not the FBI and

15

not the prosecutor.

that there will be a prosecution.

a statement by the assistant that as to Mr. Levine's

client, Mr. Segura, it was only several months before

the indictment was returned that he felt he had a

prosecutable case.

It is not a foregone conclusion
In this case, we have

They have based much of their argument on a

22

witness named Giffin, an individual named Giffin, who

23

gave us information about the murders, who was going to

be our main witness, and he didn't testify at trial.

25

Fortunately Mr. Kinard, one of the co-defendants did,

was not an issue in this case at all until the Court of

Appeals, when it was really raised by hr. Diamond,

Appeals .
The panel of the

Court of Appeals ruled in our

favor

and said there was asecurity basis, which,

say, under the regulations has to be there, and under

would he have had a constitutional right to retain

2

counsel of his choice before indictment?

3

MR. FFEYi

Well, I kind of discussed that a

4

little bit back in December in the Flanagan case,

5

that would sound to me something like a substantive due

6

process right, ani I am not sure what this Court would

7

find.

8

if somebody wants to retain a lawyer it is the kind of

9

associational interest in running one's own affairs that

but

There would be a decent argument, I think, that

10

the government could no arbitrarily interfere with or

11

preven t.

12

The point about the Gulag business, about

13

holding people indefinitely without a lawyer, of course,

14

raises a due process claim.

16

indefinitely, not because of their right to counsel but

16

because they can't be deprived of their liberty without

due process.

must be a charge and a judicial findings and a judicial

proceeding.

time
NR. FREY:

2

Well,

I want to make a point.

The

3

Court, of Appeals said in its opinion that holding them

4

in ADD was equivalent to an arrest because it serves the

5

important need of investigative officers to protect

6

witnesses and evidence, facilitate an effective

7

investigation, prevent further criminal activity by the

8

suspec t.
And it said these are the interests that lead

10

to an arrest.

12

arrest.

13

generally have that in this country.

14

not for the purpose of preventive detention, but they

15

may lead to the institution of a judicial proceeding.

16

That is a different story.

17

Well, the Court of Appeals, I think it
That is not the purpose of an

That is preventive detention.

We don't
Most arrests are

In this case we do have preventive detention

18

which is perfectly legitimate in the context of the

19

prison situation.

20

There is no prosecution.

It is not an accusation of a crime.
So right to counsel.

21

MR. FREY:
