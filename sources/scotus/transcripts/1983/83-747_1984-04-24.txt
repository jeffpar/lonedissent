ORAL ARGUMENT CF E. BARFETT PRETTY MAN, JR., ESC.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FRETTYMAN:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court.

This case involves an interpretation

11

of three sentences in the Longshoremen ’ s Act which at

12

the time of the injuries in this case was the governing

13

law in the District of Columbia for workers

14

compensation.

15

904(a) and 905(a) of the Act.

These three sentences appear in Sections

WKATA is and has been for many years in

16
17

overall charge of building the Metro system in the

18

Washington metropolitan area.

19

pursuant to an interstate compact between the

20

jurisdictions of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and

21

Virginia.

22

Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, to construct the

23

system, and WHATA as the general contractor subcontracts

24

the construction out to hundreds of subcontractors and

25

thousands of sub-subcontractors at various tiers.

It has been doing so

The compact directs WMATA, the Washington

3

Prior to 1979, each sub at whatever tier

1

2

purchased its own. workers compensation, and this simply

3

proved to be unworkable.

4

contracts have trouble getting insurance and competing

5

for the bids.

6

they had secured or not, or whether they were

7

maintaining their insurance, and since the purpose of

8

the Act is to make certain that all employees are

9

covered at all times, WMATA in 1971 introduced the CIP,

The small and minority

WhA.TA was never really certain whether

10

the coordinated insurance pregram, or what we call

11

wrap-u p .

12

.

And this is a single policy for comp, for

13

general liability, for workers' liability, covering

14

every employee at every tier in the entire system.

15

WMATA did this by being named itself in the policy, and

16

then in order to make sure that all employees are

17

covered, because you obviously couldn't name every

18

employee, by naming every sub as the sub came on beard

19

on the policy,

20

and respondents, incidentally, do net deny that we

21

secure d.

and WMATA thereby secured under the Act,

These suits were brought by seven injured

22
23

employees.

Compensation was promptly paid to them under

24

the wrap-up, and then the employees brought these tort

25

suits.

QUESTION;

1

Nr. Prettyman, does the same

2

situation exist outside the Metropolitan Transit

3

Authority in other construction contracts in areas

4

MR. PRETTYMAN;

5

Let me answer that in two

6

ways.

The wrap-up itself is being used extensively

7

throughout the United States in every large project.

8

it affects the longshoremen, Ycur Hcncr, it is rather

9

limited, in the sense that there are other statutes that

10

incorporate the Longshoremen's Act, the Defense Base

11

Act, and other statutes, but it does not apply, and

It results in lower

quite high.

10

Is that substantially less than it

would have been if the individual subcontractors were

SR. PRETTYMAN:

cases held that WMATA was a general contractor, that

3

since the subs had not secured, that WMATA fulfilled its

4

statutory duty in securing with this policy, that all of

5

the employees had received compensation under the

6

policy, and therefore WMATA was entitled to immunity

7

from tort suit under Section 905(a).

QUESTIONS

As an employer, Mr. Prettyman?

HR. PRETTYMAN*

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. PRETTYMAN:

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. PRETTYMANs

I am sorry, Ycur Honor?

As an employer, or what?
No, as a contractor.

Yes, as a contractor.
And I will get to that

14

specific language, but of course, as you know, the

15

statute —
QUESTION;

16
17

But only because somebody else has

not — did net have their own insurance?
MR. PRETTYMAN;

18

Kell, let me make it clear.

19

It gets the immunity as a statutory employer, and it

20

gets it because it had a duty as a contractor to go cut

21

and secure, in view of the fact under Section 905(a)

22

that the employer was a — the direct employer was a

23

subcontractor.

changed.

Well,

suppose the subs never

There was a group of subs, and they all sat

7

1

down with the general contractor/ and they all said,

2

well,

3

the general said, well, why don’t I just buy it for all

4

of you, it will be cheaper in the long run, and the sub

5

says, well, if that’s the way you want it, but we will

6

get our own if you want.

7

because there has been a mutual decision that the subs

8

won’t.

9

how should we go about getting our insurance, and

And so you buy the insurance

Wouldn’t you be making the same argument here?
MF. PRETTYMAN:

Well, Your Honor, first of

10

all, the subs can dc that --

11

QUESTION;

12

ME. FRETTYMANc

Can you answer that yes or no?
Oh, well, I would be making

13

the same argument here unless the Court were to hold --

14

it would be rather unusual under the circumstances here

15

-- if the Court were to hold that we were merely acting

16

as an agent for the subs and that they really secured

17

and we didn't.

18

QUESTION;

Nc, the general buys it, and

19

everybody agrees they are going to buy it, and you will

20

be — you are the one who will pay the — ycu will pay

21

the employees.

22

MR. PRETTYMAN;

Then I think we are fulfilling

our duty under the statute to secure.

QUESTION:

Sc could they sue — you suggest

MB. ERETTYMAN:

theory that everybody gets immunity.

That is the modern

trend, as pointed cut by Professor Larsen in his

treatise.

into the second sentence of Section 904, and you have a

quite important.

But if you don't do that, then what we say is

You look to who has the duty.

As scon as ycu get

"In the case of an employer who is a

but "the contractor shall be liable for and shall secure

24

the payment of such compensation."

That is our situation.

10

And that is what we

1

Now, when we do that, then it may be that you

2

will eventually hold in the next case, not this one,

3

that the sub may nevertheless have immunity because it

4

was contingently liable in the event that we failed to

5

secure, but the important point is that we get immunity

6

under Section 905(a) because we fulfilled the duty that

7

we had at that point.

8

for and shall secure."

9

that is what we did.

10

That is us.

That is WMATA.

"The contractor shall be liable

Now, is it part of your

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And therefore it Is your position

that the subcontractor is liable?
MR. FRETTYMAN:

Well, as I say,

it may be in

71

the next case that they are liable, but I would point

23

out to you that the modern trend in this is to say that

24

as soon as somebody secures at any tier, at any point,

25

as soon as somebody secures, everyone up the line should

11

1

be immune from tort suit thereafter because they are

2

potentially liable in the even cf the circumstance --

3

QUESTION:

Well, that may be the modern trend

4

in legislation or something, but it doesn't hardly

5

square with the Longshoremen's Act, does it?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

6
7

Well, I respectfully submit

that that issue has not been decided --

8

QUESTION:

Well, it may not.

9

MR. PRETTYMAN:

-- and it doesn't have tc be

10

decided in this case.

11

case is, did we have a duty, and did we fulfill it and

12

thereby do we get the immunity -QUESTION:

13

All you have to decide in this

Well, if you have a duty and you

14

have fulfilled it, the sub, the actual employer, didn't

15

have a duty, and didn’t fulfill it, and why should he

16

have immunity under the Longshoremen's Act?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

17

Well, because he was

18

potentially liable in the case that something happens to

19

our insurance.

20

Honor.

The employer -QUESTION:

21
22

There is a concommitant duty here, Ycur

Nothing happened tc ycur

25

Pardon me?

Nothing happened to your

in sura nee.

12

MR. PRETTYMAN:

1

No, absolutely not.

And in

2

this case it is just clear as can be that we did what we

3

were supposed to do, and that we should therefore get

4

the immunity for doing it.
QUESTION:

5

That is the quid pro —

Well, Mr. Prettyman, what if the

6

subcontractor got the insurance, and the general

7

contractor didn’t?

8

should have immunity in that circumstance?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

10

Do you think the general contractor

Again, that is the next case

where you may eventually hold --

11

Well, but what do you think?

12

KR. PRETTYMAN;

I think myself unless you

adopt the modern view that we should be liable,

14

absolutely,

do not adopt the modern view in the next case.

17

Are we free to, as you say, adopt

the modern view?

Well, it isn’t if the statute

doesn't permit it.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

But I think the statute dees

13

1

permit it.

2

and let me turn to that, because I think quite clearly

3

here the real issue cones down to whether we are a

4

statutory employer protected by Section 905(a), and as

5

you know, Section 905(a) says the liability of an

6

employer prescribed in Section 904(a) of this Act shall

7

be exclusive.
New, does that apply to us?

8
9

The statute says that under Section 905(a),

issue.

That is the

And I would submit to you that it doesn't make

10

any sense under this statute and this statute that you

11

are interpreting, it doesn’t make any sense for us net

U

to be a statutory employer, and let me tell you why.
If we are not a statutory employer, it means

13
14

that we do not even have to pay out what we have

15

secured, because under Sections 907 to 9 and 914, paying

16

out, that only relates to an employer.

17

wouldn't have to notify the Labor Department when we

18

made our first payment under this comp policy because it

19

says only the employer does that.

20

the contractor couldn't be sued for comp by the

21

employee.

22

couldn't even sue us, because the statute says that only

23

an employer can be used by the employee.

24
25

It means that we

It would mean that

So we have got this policy out there and they

MR . PRETTYMAN;

You are just a gratuitous

ME. PRETTYMAN;

That’s right, a volunteer, as

5

the Court of Appeals said, Ycur Honor.

6

are not.

We had a duty and we fulfilled it here.
QUESTION;

7

And of course we

Well,

I suppose regardless of whose

8

name is on the policy, the cost of the premium in one

9

way or another is being shared by both the general

10

contractor and the sub, either in the form cf a lower

11

bid by the sub if the general contractor gets it or vice

12

versa.
MR. PEETTYMAN;

13

Ycur Honor, the lower price

14

that is submitted in the bids by the subs is applicable

15

to everybody, everybody who comes along.

16

a better position vis-a-vis each other.

17

outbid each other without counting the cost of the

18

insurance in the bid, but they can, and as a matter cf

19

fact this happened about a month ago.
QUESTION;

20

They dcn’t get
They have to

The point is just that I think you

21

might find that the cost of the premium is economically

22

being shared by both the subcontractor and the general

23

contra ctor.
MR. PRETTYMAN;

24
25

Honor,

Well, to be very honest, Ycur

I think the cost of this premium is being paid by

15

16

We couldn’t even be sued by either the

So it seems to me that the only thing that

17

makes any sense under this statute at all is for us to

18

be deemed the statutor y employer under Section 905(a).

19

Sow, let me turn to the fact that they claim

20

here that we are reall y an owner and not a general

21

contractor.

22

because all of the ecu rts below, including the Court of

23

Appeals, said that we were a general contractor.

24

were not, I don’t knew who would be, because we are the

25

only one in overall ch arge of this project.

I think I can pass very quickly over that,

16

If we

We are the

1

ones who have let all cf the bids out and approve

2

everybody.

3

We supervise.

We control.

We monitor.

And I might say that if we were the owner, we

4

would be very happy about it, because then we wouldn't

have any responsibility under this Act at all --

Can't you be both?

QUESTION;

9

ME. PEETTYMAK;

Eardon me?

Can't you be both?
You can be both an owner and a

10

contractor, but I would point cut to you that

11

respondents were specifically asked that question by the

12

Court of Appeals, are you suing them as an owner, and

13

they said no.

we don't have to secure, we don't have to pay, we don't

15

have to do anything.

Most importantly, if we are not an owner,

ME. PBETTYMAN;
we are an owner.

If we are not a contactor and

Eid I misspeak myself?

Excuse me.

So, I think it is quite clear that we are a

22

contractor and covered here.

I would submit to you that

23

it simply makes no sense, the Court of Appeals

24

formulation in this case, because it net only

25

contradicts the Act, but it is really totally unworkable

17

1

«hat they suggest.

2

And as fcr respondent's suggestion, well, why

3

don't you go out and get a letter from everybody saying

4

they have secured, we have 355 subs and 2,765

5

sub-subcontractors in this case.

6

unworkable.

It would be totally

Kay I ask, about this army of subs

and sub-subs and all, supposing some of them in

10

ignorance or whatever it might be had gone out and

conservative lawyer who said, I don't care what the

13

Metropolitan Area Transit Authority did, you get your

own insurance, and they got it.

They had a very

within the meaning of 904(a)?

19

MR. PRETTYNAN:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And then as to them you would be

21

secondarily liable in tort as to those — I mean, if

22

they could identify such a situation, you would be a

23

third party tort feasor?

24

MR. PRETTYMAN;

25

view.

Unless you adopt the modern

I hate to keep throwing that in, but the next

18

1

case, you may say everybody gets immunity, but if you do

2

not do

that, then we would be the third party, correct.
QUESTION:

3

But under your reading of the

4

statute, one or the other is -- you are going to say

5

CHIEF JUSTICE BUBGERs

Mr. Mulroney.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. MULRONEY, ESQ.,

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

19

MR. MULRONEY;

20

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21

please the Court.

The issue in this case is whether

22

Metro should be given immunity from third party suits by

23

these respondents despite the plain language of Section

24

905(a)

25

the plain language of Section 933(a), preserving the

granting immunity only tc employers, and despite

27

1

injured employee's right tc proceed against any person

2

other than the employer.

3

The issue is not, as Metro states, whether

4

Metro must b e responsi ble f or loth da mages in to rt

Metro merely voluntarily paid the premium for

10
11

these coverages in order tc save millions of dollars.
QUESTION:

12

13

That is what employers usually do.

They just pay the premiums.

14

MR. MULRONEY:

That is what employers normally

15

do.

16

an employer pays his own premium.

17

here.

18

employers, and has informed them under the coordinated

19

insurance program net to submit lids that do net take

20

into account the coordinated insurance program's

21

covera ges.

22

The statute normally, under the traditional scheme,
That hasn't happened

Metre has provided the coverages for the

New, as a practical matter, this means that

23

any contractor who has been awarded a contract under

24

Phase 2 has not submitted the cost of workers

25

compensation in his bid. He can't, because Metro decides

28

1

who is going to get the contract, and it usually awards

2

the contract to the low bidder, so that when the

3

contract is awarded, Metro assures itself that the

4

contractor who is given the contract has net secured his

5

own workers compensation insurance.

6

Now, before I go forward, I would want tc make

7

one thing perfectly clear, and that is that it is very

8

much in issue, and the respondents deny that Metro has

9

secured compensation pursuant tc its 9C4(a) duty, and

10

that is for two reasons.

Number One, it is that the

11

employer has the primary obligation to secure benefits.

12

If the employers herein, the respondents employers, have

13

not secured compensation, and if the coordinated

14

insurance program in fact prevents them from securing

15

compensation, there is something basically flawed about

16

the program itself.

17

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Mulroney, if the

18

contractor gets the insurance, why doesn't the

19

contractor become the employer for the purpose of this

20

and the other sections? That seems to be a reasonable

21

reading of the statutory scheme.

22

ME. MULRONEY:

Your Honor, because the statute

23

does not make them an employer.

24

you understand the second sentence of Section 904(a),

25

imposes the duties of a guarantor.

29

A contractor's duty, if

It is the practical

1

equiva lent of Section 56 of the New York Act. It imposes

2

on the contractor a secondary obligation to secure the

3

corapen sation in the event that the employer he hires is

uninsu r ed.
QUESTION:

5

But that answer doesn’t make any

6

sense to me in view of the dependent clause at the end,

7

QUESTION;

5

Well, we are back to that same

6

fruitless inquiry, I guess, hut it seems to me that you

7

are taking the position that the general contractor, if

8

the subcontractor doesn't provide insurance, has the

9

legal responsibility to provide the compensation tc the

10

injured worker, and becomes liable by virtue of the

11

provisions of Sections 907, 908, and 909.

12

speak in terms of an employer, and yet we are invoking

13

It makes the contractor

The statute presumes compliance with its

23
24

terms.

Every employer must secure, must secure

25

compen sation.

That includes subcontractors.

35

The

1

statute doesn't presume that subcontractors are going to

2

be in default of their statutory obligation s, and in

3

fact every subcontractor on the Metro proje ct and every

4

prime contractor has presumed that by parti cipating in

5

the coordinated insurance plan, and by beco ming a named

6

insured, they have secured coverage within the meaning

7

of the Act.

They must.

And the coordinated insurance pla n must

must necessarily provide insurance coverage for his own

QUESTION ;

Eecause nobody seemed to quote the

defintion, but it is beginning to sink through to me

that perhaps the issue in the case is whether the word

insurance or just someone who hires the people.

is there really something -- Your opponent talks about a

Isn't that so?
If you --

And it basically defines employer

as the person obligated to pay and secure compensation

as provided in the Act, and under that definition, it

certainly is reasonable to say that the contractor is an

employer.

41

1

HR. MULRONEYi

Your Honor, the employer is

2

obligated as an employer to secure compensation.

3

contractor is never obligated as an employer.

4

obligated as a contractor, and the duties imposed by the

5

second sentence of 904(a) are specifically there only

because of the relationship that the contractor has with

a subcontractor.

hire for purposes not consistent with the Act an

He is

12

the contractor to any immunity that he would otherwise

13

have.

It does not entitle

14

All he has to do is hire an insured

15

subcontractor in order to protect the injured employee,

16

and the statute does net accord him any immunity for

that.

Section 33, or Section 905, 933(i), which was amended in

19

1959,

20

immunities of an employer to extend any further than

21

what the Congress called in 1959 the employer-employee

22

family, and that is very important, because this Act is

23

based on the New York Act; 904(a) is based on Section 56

24

of the New York statute, and in 1946, the New York Court

25

of Appeals in the Sweezy case held that under no

MR. MULRONEY:

21

Your Honor.

There is much more to it than

22

that.

The Act also serves to preserve the

23

employee's common law rights of action which are net

24

specifically eliminated by Section 905(a), and the cnly

25

remedies that the injured worker has that are eliminated

Another consideration is, Congress indicated

it wanted the vessel owner to be in precisely the same

situation as a third party would be in a land-based

setting, indicating that Congress was aware of the case

5

law under the District of Columbia Act allowing the

6

injured worker the right to proceed against the general

7

contra ctor.

8
9

There is no question that the case law has
been unanimous in allowing suits by subcontractor

10

employees against the general contractor, despite the

11

fact that 904(a) imposes a secondary obligation on the

12

contractor to secure compensation in the event that his

13

own employer fails to do so.

14

In these cases, Metro has preempted the

15

obligation of the employers to secure compensation if in

16

fact the Metro wrap-up plan does not satisfy the

17

obligations of the employer to secure compensation.

18

respondents submit that the employers have secured

19

compensation by participating in this plan.

hasn't secured it merely by purchasing it for the

benefit of the employers who are under a statutory

obligation to secure it in the first place.

Metro

In fact, there is an important reason why

24

Metro should be denied immunity and that is because by

25

purchasing the premium they have tended to undermine

45

safety in the work place. Congress indicated in 1972, as

2

I stated earlier, that the employer should shoulder the

3

burden of the premium payment in order for him to have

4

an interest in safe conduct.
When Metro instituted this program in 1971,

5

precisely the opposite thing happened.

7

who were insured entities had no interest in getting the

8

work done, and we are talking about very dangerous

work.

Metro has indicated that this is true by

16

virtue of the fact that in June of 1978, to replace that

incentive, they had to institute a safety awareness

10

employer as an employer.

An employer is based in the

same way as to the New York statute's definition c f

13

that the employer-employee relationship is that

14

contractual relationship that exists between a per son

15

who hires another person to perform services.

Therefore, Congress is essentially only

they wanted the contractor to make sure that the subs

mean that the contractor became an employer for Section
