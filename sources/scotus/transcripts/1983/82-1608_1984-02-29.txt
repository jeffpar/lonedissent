ORAL ARGUMENT OF LeRCY EUGENE DeVEAUX, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF CF PETITIONER

8

HP. LEE;

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
The issues in this case are basic commerce

11
12

clause issues;

Can a state, in selling natural

13

resourcess to private parties, insist that those

14

resources be processed before the resources can be

15

shipped in interstate or foreign commerce?

16

Congress’ consent to such a restraint be implied from a

17

U.S. Forest Service policy governing federally owned

18

natural resources?

Can

The facts cf this case are clear and they are

19

not in dispute.

In 1980 the State of Alaska noticed,

20

sent out prospectuses and sample contracts offering to
21

sell 49 million board-feet of mixed spruce and hemlock
22
in Icy

Bay, Alaska.

A special condition to the contract

23

in this case stated that before the logs out of this
24

sale could be shipped in interstate or foreign commerce

they must be primarily processed
The State reason for primary processing is to

2

3

encourage in-state construction of lumber mills and to

4

support existing lumber mills within the state.
South-Central, a bidder and a potential bidder

5
6

in this case, cuts, sells, and ships logs in interstate

7

and foreign commerce, particularly, in fact virtually

8

all of them, in foreign commerce to Japan, and that is
noted even in the state's brief at page 34.

10
11

At the time

of this sale, South-Central did not at that time have a
functioning mill within the State of Alaska.
The first question that probably should be

12

addressed is whether Congress has consented to state
13
activity which would otherwise be a violation of the
14
commerce clause.

The district court,

Dnited States

15
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the State of
16
Alaska in this Court have all conceded that Congress has
17
not expressly consented to the primary manufacturing or
18
primary processing requirement at issue in this case.
1
Instead, the Ninth Circuit created a novel
20
doctrine of implied consent, saying in effect that
21

federal consent can be implied from Forest Service
22
policies governing only national forests.

With all due

23
respect to the Ninth Circuit Ccurt of Appeals, that is
24
simply

wrong and this Court has never so held.

Alaska argues in its brief that it’s simply a

at pa g e 28.

13

QUESTION;

Well, that's true, isn’t it?

Doesn't Alaska own the timber we're talking about?
ME. DeVEAUX;

14

Yes, it does.

What it's saying

15

in effect by saying that is that it's a simple seller of

16

timber when it requires someone to process it

17

downst ream.
If they were a simple seller of timber, Your

18
19

Honor,

would they forego over SO percent of the value of

20

that timber in cash for some political or

21

function for the state that no seller of timber in the

22

private marketplace would do?

MR. DeVEAUX;

1

In the state's brief, in its

2

appendix, pages — I believe it's page A-8 — when later

3

looking to sell the same timber the state forester, the

4

state expert in this area, states in numbered paragraph

5

3s
"Increased Revenue.

6

The revenue to the state

7

by not

requiring primary manufacture will be

8

substantially increased from $216 ,000 to $2,440,000."

9

And as that sale has been completed, the state made a

10

woefully small estimate.

11

than twice the amount that they estimated.

talking about something in the neighborhood between $4

13

and $5 million.

20

than a normal market participant would look at or a

In

Let me make the point more precisely, maybe.

23

In a free market environment with this particular

24

resource, logs, timber, if you will, legs are hauled

25

from where they are cut down to a mill site, and they

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

are put in at one end cf the mill and they come out the

2

other end of the mill as finished lumber.

3

lumber that can be made out cf that log that the market

4

needs at that time based on that particular piece cf

5

wood will be made.

9

a two-step process.

In other

instead cf having a cne-step process we have now
The logs now come into mill and are

10

cut up into chunks of weed 8-3/4 inches thick, and then

11

have tc be shipped to another mill where the finished

12

products are made.
I cannot see under those kinds of facts hew

13
14.

the state can say they are simple market participants,

15

particularly when you take and do this two-step tier

16

that dees not exist in the ncrrral marketplace, that the

17

value of the log is less when it comes out of the first

18

tier than it was when it went in, and that I refer the

19

Court to the Kenai Lumber briefs in the lower court

20

which in fact say that is true, and they are an

21

Intervenor on the side of the state.
That is why the price differential is so

22

23

great.

The legs are worth sc much less and so much more

24

difficult to market after they have had this primary

25

manufacturing.

All this is clear from a memorandum

9
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 6204300

1

attached to the state's brief.

Again referring tc the

2

state's addendum or appendix tc their brief, page 5,

3

we're discussing primary manufacture:

4

"Primary manufacturing policy limits the

5

options cf the logging industry in marketing their

6

products on the world market."
Further, on page 8 cf that same gentleman's

7
8

memorandum to the state he says:
"Since the sale is appraised to be

9
10

competitive, anyone in the private sector can bid cn

11

it.

12

products industry an opportunity to bid on that sale."

This gives a much larger segment of the forest

And then it follows in the very next

13
14

paragraph, again refers to the rate differential in

15

plus.
QUESTION;

16

Mr. DeVeaux, what percentage cf the

17

timber lands in Alaska are state-owned as opposed tc

18

federal or privately owned?
ME. DeVEAUX:

19

The Federal Government owns the

20

majority, and I believe 20 percent is owned by the

21

state,

22

some time in the future — those are primarily white

23

spruce forests — will be of great value.

24

believe is owned by the Federal Government and then a

25

very small percentage is in private hands, principally

and some of those are in the interior, which at

75 percent I

1

the natives and some small holdings.
How can the state, when its own forester,

2
3

their own expert, puts forth such evidence, state that

4

this is a market participant, that they are merely a

5

seller of timber?

6

downstream economic control of a milling business.
QUESTION*

The state could mill it itself,

In

11

QUESTIONi

If it had —

12

ME. DeVEAUXs

13

QUESTION*

If it had a functioning mill.

Yes, a functioning mill.

And you

14

say that it would have to operate it itself; it couldn’t

15

lease it out?
NR. DeVEAUX*

16
17

Yes, that’s -- I don’t know that

it couldn't lease it out.
QUESTION*

18

Well, it could lease it out.

Eut

19

then could it require that all the logs be run through

20

that mill before they enter interstate commerce?
MR. DeVEAUX:

21

No, Your Honor, I don’t think

22

they cculd.

What they could do is make an incentive so

23

that someone in the private sector would find it both

efficient and expedient or economically feasible tc do

1

Well, their rental, their lease,

2

their rental under the lease, let's assume, was a

3

percentage rental of everything that was sold, and then

it says everything, all the logs, are going to have to

I suppose that is a much closer question than

the one we have.

to what happened in Foster-Fountain Packing Company,

where the state of Louisiana --

18

I don't believe this is at all a close

This is mere, the case we have is mere akin

QUESTION:

I suppose your fundamental argument

19

is that this kind cf an arrangement that you actually

20

have in this case just insulates the local processor

21

from any kind of competition anywhere else?

22

MR. DeVEAUX:

Yes, it does, and it forces the

23

timber company who purchases those logs to deal with a

24

competitor, if you will, and to ship those logs to a

25

competitor if he buys them, or not to buy at all, or to

it could be more efficiently done wherever the logs are

going,

the lumber is going to be used for its ultimate

And I think that’s the basic problem with this

5
6

case,

is that it forces something to be done that could

7

be more efficiently done somewhere else.
QUESTION :

8

Well, do you suppose the state

could say, none of the logs that we own and sell tc
10

anybody will ever be used outside the state of Alaska?
KB. DeVEAUX;

11

I think that’s very similar to

12

the cases involving natural gas, which are very early

13

cases in this century, principally the Kansas Natural

14

Gas case and also the case of Pennsylvania versus West

15

Virginia .
QUESTION;

16
17

We're talking about state-owned

logs.
KB. DeVEAUX;

18

Yes, but this Court has always

1

said something’s different about natural resources, and

20

there's been a continual comment that something is

21

different —

resources?

24

25

Well,

what about natural

What about the cement case, the South

KB. DeVEAUX;

The Beeves case poses a question

13

ALOEASON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

on that, but even in the Reeves case both the majority

2

and the minority agreed about one thing:

3

natural resources were different and they had to be

4

treated different, because they go to the very basis for

6

the commerce clause itself.
QUESTION;

6
7

10

Well, there the state made the

cement, though, didn't it?
MR. DeVEAUX:

8

9

that somehow

Yes, it did.

If the state made

the lumber here I think they could sell it to whomever
they wish.
QUESTION;

11

Well, the timber is a renewable

12

resource and I would hope Alaska's in the business cf

13

replanting and growing its timber.

14

MR. DeVEAUX;

15

QUESTION:

16

Well, I hope sc.

I don't see that that’s like

natural gas, which you can't reproduce.
MR. DeVEAUX;

17

But still, natural resources are

18

by happenstance within the state.

timber, they're only there because that was the luck of

20

the draw.

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. DeVEAUX:

Even if they're

What about fish?
Sometimes these can be

23

non-renewable if you overfish them.

But they again are

24

the same thing, and this Court has said in Hughes versus

Mr.

The primary federal interest in this case is

On the implicit approval theory, we think that

significant other federal policies that Congress has

Congress' express statutory policy against imposing

QUESTION;

Why does the Federal Government

2

impose the restraint, the very restraint you're talking

3

about,

4

on timber exported from Alaska?
MS. OBERLY*

The federal policy began in 1S28,

5

when the United States ran Alaska as a territory, and

6

essentially its origins are for the same reasons that

7

Alaska now wants to have the same requirement.

8

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Well, was it to encourage the local

industry or to see to it that the Federal Government had
local processing for its own needs?
MS. OBERLY:

What was it?

In 1928 it was both, because in

12

our capacity -- in the United States' capacity as

13

running Alaska as a territory, it had a legitimate

14

concern in encouraging local employment, as well a.s

15

providing sufficient timber processing capacity for

16

federal timber.

17

QUESTION*

18

MS. OBERLY:

And what is it now?
Today the policy applies to all

19

of the states west of the hundredth meridian, including

20

Alaska, although in Alaska it's by regulation and in the

21

other lower 48 states it's by statute.

22

policy is basically to ensure jobs for Americans, but

23

it's on a national collective basis that Congress has

24

made that decision, rather than on a single state

25

protectionist basis.

And today the

20

And this Court has repeatedly invalidated

1
2

single state protectionist legislation when a state has

3

attempted to do it.

4

Congress would approve of the same thing,

5

action by a state.

it’s taking the entire national welfare into account, as

7

is properly its function under the commerce clause.

There’s no reason to assume that

When Congress makes that judgment,

8

When a state makes that judgment, it’s only

9

considering its own parochial interests, and Congress

10

may or may not find those compatible with the national

11

welfare.

12

there be exress Congressional sanction for something

13

that would otherwise clearly be a burden.

14

That’s why we think it is quite important that

There may be some inconsistency here, in that

15

the Federal Government is doing something that on its

16

face appears harmonious with what Alaska’s doing.

17

at least it’s a decision at the federal level by the

18

representatives of the entire nation that that’s the

19

policy they want.

20

Eut

In Alaska’s case of Alaska’s regulation, it’s

21

a decision by one state to oust from competition

22

residents or corporations attempting to compete within

Alaska who are not represented in Alaska, and it has its

24

principal effect here, which makes it even more serious

25

in cur view, on foreign commerce since 90 percent of

Alaska 's timber is exported to Japan.
The subject of log export restraints is a

3

constant subject of negotiation between the United

4

States and Japan, between the U.S. Trade Representative

5

and Japan, and something those two countries discuss on

6

a government to government level.

7

It’s not something that the United States

8

Trade Representative's negotiations are helped by having

9

states add.

Even if their voices are harmonious,

10

they're still a second voice rather than the Federal

11

Government speaking with one voice, as this Court has

12

clearly said must be the case in matters affecting

13

foreign affairs.

14

So that if Congress chooses, knowing all the

15

things it's weighing in the balance, to have both a

16

policy of in-state processing for federal timber and to

17

be against export restraints, it does so with full

18

awareness of the needs of the entire country.

19

Alaska makes that decision, it's just simply not the

The requirement of primary manufacture cn

2

public lands in Alaska has teen in existence for over 50

3

years.

It was adopted at a time when the State of

4

Alaska

was not a state; it was a federal territory.

5

the purpose at that time was to encourage the

6

development of a timber processing industry in the

7

remote coastal regions of Alaska.

8

But

That policy for primary manufacture in the

9

national forests in Alaska continues today under

10

regulations of the Forest Service which have the

11

explicit purpose of keeping and assuring that there is a

12

continued existence of a forest processing industry in

13

Alaska.

14

least twofold;

The effect of the federal policy has been at

First of all, it has provided an economic

15
16

basis for the development of communities in rural

17

southeast Alaska; and secondly, coupled with the primary

18

manufacture requirement imposed on other federal timber

19

exports in the Pacific Northwest, it has had the effect

20

of creating a market for processed timber with a number

21

of Pacific Rim nations for both pulp and for cants.
Since statehood, Alaska has itself enunciated

22

23

a primary manufacture requirement for sales from state

24

land.

25

to that of the federal requirement.

The purpose of the state requirement is identical
It is to keep the

And that if Alaska attempted to

25

MR. LORENSEN*

There would certainly be an

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

Whether it would be

2

illegal or not, obviously we would argue in a different

3

case.

4

have been decided that, unless Alaska could show seme

5

independent policy power or safety justification for the

6

requirement, that it probably would not be.

I think under the various natural gas cases that

Even if there has not been Congressional

7
8

consent to the state's requirement here, we believe that

9

the state is in fact a market participant and is

10

therefore not subject to the commerce clause.
And thirdly, even if ultimately it is

11
12

determined that the state is net a market participant,

13

but is subject to the commerce clause, we believe that

14

the primary manufacture requirement imposed by the State

15

of Alaska satisfies traditional commerce clause

Alaska's primary manufacture requirement

13

parallels that of the Federal Government, both in its

14

purpose and in its effect, and given the 50-year history

15

of the federal requirement for primary manufacture in

16

Alaska , that in 198C Congress clearly intended and

17

expected that primary manufacture on Forest Service land

18

in Alaska promote local economic activity, coupled with

19

the existence of Alaska’s own longstanding primary

20

manufacture requirement, we believe that the Ninth

21

Circuit fairly and properly inferred that Congress also

22

intended, and perhaps Congress may alsc have expected,

23

that the State of Alaska would be able to impose the

24

same kind of primary manufacturing requirement.

requirement, formal privity of contract.

23

As has already been brought out,

because the

24

state imposes this primary manufacture requirement the

25

state does receive a lower price for its timber than it

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

would receive if it permitted timber tc be exported in

the round.

3

in effect as a subsidy by the state or a subsidy by the

4

Federal Government, because the Federal Government takes

5

the same reduced price for its timber as a result cf its

6

requirement, as a subsidy by the state in support cf the

7

continued existence of an Alaska timber processing

8

industry and the communities which depend on it both

9

economically and socially.

The difference between those prices operates

I think in an abstract sense we might

10

11

characterize this subsidy as an alternate and presumably

12

far better and more desirable fcrm cf federal and state

13

welfare.

14

The Petitioner claims that we are not a market

15

participant because we provide this subsidy, and

16

therefore we cannot be treated as a private trader.

17

the Petitioner we believe is misconstruing the thrust of

18

the market participant inquiry.

19

whether we are acting like any private trader similarly

20

situated could act, not whether we act with the same

21

profit motives that the private trader does.

The correct inquiry is

most what Alaska does in requiring primary manufacture

the saire resonance which is created as a result of the

find it incredulous to believe that the Solicitor

General would suggest that the State of Alaska is not

speaking with the same voice that the Federal Gcvernirent

10

Finally, Your Honcr, we wish to offer that if

11
12

the Court determines that we are not a market

13

participant, that Congress has not consented to our

14

primary manufacture requirement, that nonetheless under

15

the facts here the state's primary manufacture

16

requirement satisfies traditional commerce clause

17

analysis under the Fike versus Bruce Church case.
The requirement applies evenhandedly, it
