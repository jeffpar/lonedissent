MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

Mr. Wallace, you may

This is an appeal from a district court

10

enforcement of key provisions of FIFRA, the Federal

15

as economic poisons.

which EPA regulates the marketing and use of what

16

Under FIFEA an EFA registration, which is

17

essentially a license, is required in order to market a

18

pesticide, and in determining whether to issue the

19

registration EFA determines whether there will he

The court also declared unconstitutional the

13

agreement that that prevision was net ripe fer review by

14

the district court for reasons stated in the briefs, and

In many ways this decision is reminiscent cf

Mr. Wallace, don’t you think the

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

district court meant that Congress had exceeded its

2

powers unless it wanted to pay compensation?

3

ME. WAILACEi

Well, that is probably what it

4

meant,

5

I just do want to say that to the extent that this

6

reflected what is discussed in the opinion, a

7

reevalration of the resolution Congress made of the

8

competing policy considerations, that was obviously

9

improper under this Court's decision, and Pensante dees

and I don’t intend to belabor anything else.

10

not here try to defend the judgment on these grounds.

11

But it is pertinent to say that the present

But

12

statute evolved through a repeated process cf amendnent

13

in which Congress gave detailed consideration to seme of

14

the problems of the industry that seemed to move the

15

district court to reach the judgment that it did, as

16

well as to advances in scientific knowledge about

17

prchleits in the use cf these chemicals on the health and

18

environment, and as well as its own experience with

19

earlier versions of the statute, which it concluded were

20

having seme undesirable effects, such as extending

21

periods of patent monopoly beyond the expirations cf the

22

patent.

23

And in response to the expenses involved in

24

research and innovation. Congress included a number cf

25

provisions in the statute, including a protection for

trade secrets as defined by the statute, the provision

2

for compensation fcr the second user of data, and a

3

prevision fcr exclusive use for a ten-year period.
QUESTION :

4

Mr. Wallace, before 1978 the law

5

was clear, was it net, that none of the information

6

supplied by a registrant would be released to anyone

7

else?
MR. WALLACE;

8
9

to the public.

10

MR. WALLACE;

Right.
That was part of the —

It would just be used by EFA.
It would be used by EFA cr the

Department of Agriculture.

QUESTION;

16

New, why should information of that kind,

17

which

pr otec ted ?

19

Yes, right.

was disclosed before

MR. WALLACE;

1S7£, not continue tc be

Well, it could be protected.

20

The question is whether there's a constitutional

21

impediment to the disclosure of the information under a

22

different rule —

23
24
25

QUESTION;

Well, you take the position that it

isn't even property?
MR. WALLACE;

Yes, we are taking that

1

position, and let ire get tc that question.

2

is important for me to make a few general comments atout

3

trade secrets tefcre getting tc the specific questions

4

involved in this case.

5

I think it

This Court has never held that a trade secret

6

can qualify as property within the meaning of the taking

7

clause of the Fifth Amendment, and while in order tc

8

rule for us the Court need ret preclude the possibility

9

that in any circumstances a trade secret could be sc

10

protected, we do think it's highly dubious that a trade

11

secret in any circumstances should qualify as property

12

under the taking clause or that that should be the focus

13

of litigation concerning disclosure of trade secrets.

14

No w

--

QUESTION;

15

Well, certainly the district court

16

thought that the law, the state law in Missouri created

17

a property interest.
ME. WALLACE;

18

I understand that, although we

19

happen tc think that that was an erroneous view of the

20

law.

21

what the Fifth Amendment to the federal Constitution

22

means,

23

it.

24
25

Eut that certainly would net be dispositive of

regardless of hew Missouri might want tc define

Let me try tc explain the reasons why the
Court should be hesitant --

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

QUESTION:

Well, if the district court is

2

right atcut what the Missouri state law is, why wouldn't

3

we accept that and say, yes, it is property?
ME. WALLACE;

4

The Eifth Amendment -- the

5

question of the meaning of the word "property” in the

6

Fifth

7

law, Justice O'Conner, rather than something that a

8

state is free to define.
QUESTION:

ME. WALLACE:

Mr. Wallace,

You address a distinction between

them?
ME. WALLACE:

Yes.

That's what I am

16

attempting to do here, because the right to exclude is

17

of a very different nature.

18

these general comments about trade secrets.

19

Let me, if T can, just make

In the Kewanee Oil case in this Court, in a

20

statement that was net disputed by any ether opinion in

21

the Court and that is entirely consistent with the

22

holding, Justice Douglas, joined by Justice Prennar,

23

said in the dissenting opinion:

24

a patent, has no property dimensicn."

25

quoted from the Court's opinion by Justice Holmes in Du

"A trade secret, unlike
And then he

1

Pent Pevder Company v. Kaslard, an opinion that is

2

discussed in the briefs in the case.

3

But there is a great deal cf additional basis

4

for this statement.

In the first place, it probably has

5

come tc the Court’s attention that the Restatement

6

previsions referred tc by the district court and by the

7

parties here are net from the Festatement cf Property;

8

they're frerr the Restatement cf Torts, the 1939

9

editio n .
And while the origins of trade secret law and

10
11

protection have not teen considered tc be property

12

origins at all, in fact comment A of the pertinent

13

section cf that Restatement, 1-1, says;
"The suggestion that one has a right to

14
15

exclude ethers from the use cf his trade secret because

16

he has a right of property in the idea has been

17

frecuently advanced and rejected.

18

prevailed is that the protection is afforded only by a

19

general duty of good faith, and that the liability rests

20

upon breach cf this duty, that is, breach cf contract,

21

abuse of confidence, or impropriety in the method cf

22

ascertaining the secret;"

The theory that has

Now, it’s true, as the briefs point out, that

23
24

trade secrets have certain cf the characteristics cf

25

property.

They can be the res cf a trust, they can be

1

treated as property for purposes of certain transactions

2

under the Internal Revenue Code.

3

of trade secrets is a law ccncerning the regulation cf

4

commercial relations.

5

QUESTION;

But basically the law

Mr. Wallace, you speak cf the law

6

of trade secrets as though perhaps there was one fount

7

for that kind cf law.

8

derived from the law of the 50 states on the subject?

9

Isn't the law of trade secrets

KB. WALLACE:

Yes, it is, Justice Behnquist.

10

But it was this particular provision of the Restatement

11

that the district court was relying on, and if I may

12

just --

13

QUESTION!

Well,

I mean, I think there's

14

perhaps a little mere implied in this question.

15

that the question cf whether something is property for

16

the takings clause purpose is a matter cf federal law

17

and not state law.

18

involving the takings clause where this Court has said,

19

even though something was deemed property under the

20

state law, we deem it not tc be property?

21

You say

Eut can you recall any case

MB. WALLACE;

I can't recall the Court

22

specifically saying that.

Usually it has net been that

23

specific about whether it wasn't property or whether it

24

just wasn’t a taking in the particular circumstances,

25

although the Court came pretty close tc that in a very

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

closely parallel case,

2

it rejected a property claim as to the ingredients of

3

the syrup that were recuired tc he placed on the lstel

4

and said that disclosure to the public of what it is

5

that you’re selling is not something that can be

6

recognized as property for purposes of the Fifth

7

Amendm ent.

8
9

10
11

the Corn Products case, in which

Eut I can’t say that the opinion was quite
that explicit.

Put we really think the disclosure is

covered ty that decision in this case.
QUESTION*

Just a minute.

If you start cut as

12

an initial matter ty saying that before you can market

13

corn products under the laws of this state you must

14

disclose what is in it, that’s quite a different

15

question from saying after

16

disclosed it, we won’t let anybody know, to say that as

17

of row we’re going tc start letting everybody knew what

18

we earlier said we wouldn’t let anybody know.

19

MR. WALLACE:

15 years that, although you

I recognize that the effect cf

20

holding that this is a property interest protected by

21

the Fifth Amendment would be that Nissouri would have tc

22

freeze its own law with respect tc trade secrets, cr

23

otherwise a change in the law would be a taking under

24

the Fifth Amendment, and that is part cf the reason why

25

I’m trying to explain to the Court that trade secret law

11

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62B-9300

1

is basically a law of evidentiary privileges rather than

2

a law cf property, which is qualified ly additional tort

3

du ties.
QUESTION;

4
5

value,

6

has economic value?

Don't you think it has a market

that someone can sell a trade secret and that it

HR. WALLACE:

7

Of course it dees, cf course it

8

does.

It can be sold in that way, tut that doesn't mean

9

that the protection — it can also be discovered through

10

reverse engineering and through overcoming the

11

qualifications on the privilege against evidentiary

12

disclo sure.

13

In this Court's opinion in Federal Open Market

14

Committee against Merrill, the Court stated, in

15

discussing the nature cf trade secret law, that federal

16

courts have long recognized a qualified evidentiary

17

privilege for trade secrets and other confidential

18

commercial information.

19

confidential communications .

20

QUESTION;

It's a form cf protection cf

let me suggest a possible analogy,

21

hypothetical, but it's been in the Courts of Appeals.

22

There's a federal statute that provides that if a record

23

is copyrighted and goes on the market you or I or anyone

24

else may make copies of that and sell them simply by

25

writing a letter to the copyright owner saying, I am

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-8300

1

copying your record, and then you pay a statutory

2

royalty.

3

of Appeals level.

4
5

Now, that's teen upheld at least at the Court

How do you distinguish the trade secrets in
this context from that compulsory copyrighting system?

6

ME. WALLACE*

Well, compulsory licensing

7

systems have teen -- are pcssitilities under the patent

8

and copyright laws.

9

secrets is that it involves suppression of information.

The principal distinction of trade

10

What the patent law provides is the right to exclude

11

someone from making or using your invention or

12

practicing it, tut you've disclosed the invention in the

13

patent application.

14

plagiarism, but doesn't suppress the information

15

itself .

And the copyright law prohitits

16

QUESTION;

17

ME. WALLACE*

18

QUESTICN*

Yes, a price for copying it.

Well, a price for using, a price

for using the original work.
MB. WALLACE*

21
22

copying it.

23

from the public.

24

though

25

tut it puts a price on it.

Eut the information is available —

19
20

Well,

Well, one, yes, in the form of

But there isn't suppression of information
The information is disseminated even

there might be a price on it, in that sense.
But the Court has never held that the Fifth

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Amendment places as premium under the taking clause cn

2

the suppression of information itself, which is what the

3

trade secret law protects in the form cf a qualified

4

evidentiary privilege.
New, there are many instances in which that

5
6

qualification of the privilege can be overcome that are

7

familiar to the Court.

8

subpoenas of business records.
QUESTION i

9

There can be grand jury

Mr. Wallace, you're talking again

10

as if there were some uniform tody of law cn trade

11

secrets.

12

earlier question that the law cf trade secrets depends

13

on

Am I wrong in thinking that you answered my

the law cf the 50 states?
ME. WALLACE:

14

You're not wrong that it dees

15

depend

16

in cur brief that the district court misconstrued

17

Missouri law in this case.

18
19

20

on the law cf the 50 states.

QUESTION:

We have contended

Do we ordinarily review that sort

of a claim?
ME. WALLACE:

Not ordinarily.

Eut in the case

21

of a nationwide statute, where the district court is

22

relying cn the Eestatement cf Torts which has been

23

adopted in many states and where many ether courts have

24

reached a contrary conclusion about what is protected,

25

think the Court has to look behind the district court's

I

1

holding with respect tc whether a scheire that Congress

2

has set up for the regulation of these potentially

3

hazardous chemicals is a taking of property.

4

QUESTION t

Well,

Mr. Wallace, let's just

5

suppose that the Court were to disagree on whether we

6

are bound by the determination of state law and were to

7

find that the trade secrets in this instance constituted

8

property under the taking clause.

9

difference in the pre-1978 data because at that point

Then is there a

10

there was no expectation at all that it would be

11

released tc the public?
HR. WALLACE;

12

We think there is not a

13

difference with respect to pre-1978 data, even on that

14

premise, because there was no legitimate expectation

15

that the duties cf federal officials in administering a

16

federal program were prescribed by Missouri law or by

17

the law cf any other state, rather than by federal

18

standards,

19

federal officials with respect to the handling cf

20

information that has been disclosed to them.
QUESTION;

21

22
23

which have long governed the duties of

before

Well, but those standards provided

1978 that they would be maintained secret.
MR. WALLACE;

I understand, but not every

24

possibility cf a change in the law constitutes a taking

25

of property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

The law of evidentiary privileges could be changed by a

2

state or by the federal courts or by Congress without it

3

resulting in a taking of property, even though someone

4

might have thought that he had an accountant's

5

privilege, for example, and disclosed certain

6

information to his accountants.
QUESTIONS

7

You know, it's just hard to

8

understand why the company wouldn't have had a

9

legitimate expectation of privacy or maintenance of

10

secret information before 1978.

11

ME. WALLACES

12

QUESTION:

13

Well --

May I ask you -- I'm sorry.

Eid

you finish your answer?

14

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I'd like to if I may.

15

It's because, to resurrect another old

16

formulation from constitutional law, if there were ever

17

a business affected with the public interest, where

18

there is need to anticipate changes in federal

19

regulatory rules as scientific knowledge and the needs

20

of public health advance, this would be such a

21

busine ss.

22

There are previsions in the federal statute

23

for rescinding the registration of a particular

24

pesticide altogether, let alone -- and this can defeat

25

investment-based expectations in plant and equipment.

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

And yet, if there are findings that protection of the

2

environment and the public health require this, it

3

nonetheless can occur, even though the expectations may

4

have arisen before the particular rescinding provision.

5

If a company is dealing in a business of this

6

kind,

it has to anticipate that the needs of the public

7

health can affect its expectations based on its

8

investments, and the needs for disclosure to

9

individuals, and particularly to physicians who might

10

have tc treat patients and tc groups representing these

11

who are exposed in unusual and concentrated ways tc

12

these chemicals, are semething that the company had to

13

anticipate that Congress might give further recognition

14

to, such as the need fer groups such as unions

15

representing agricultural werkers or workers in the

16

pesticide factories or physicians groups to learn the

17

infermation that they need tc know to make sure that EFA

18

is conducting its affairs properly and that the hazards

19

that these people are exposed to can be properly avoided

20

o r tre a ted .
QUESTION:

21

Mr. Wallace, I don't exactly

22

understand how the compensation provision would

23

operate.

24

conveyed by the public generally, through say a trade

25

journal survey, you end up with ten competing companies

If information revealed to the public is then

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

ME. WALLACES

The statute provides that that

3

disclosure provision dees net affect the provision with

4

respect to the use cf this information to support an

5

application for registration.

6

has to cite to the data, and by citing to the data puts

7

himself in the position of promising tc pay compensation

8

for a part of the cost of conducting the tests and

9

securing the data.

10
11

QUESTION*

So the applicant still

Net because the Constitution

requires it, because the statute does.

12

MR. WALLACE*

That is our view,

that Congress

13

could

14

if a pesticide has already been recognized as fit for

15

marketing other persons who are able to duplicate it,

ME. RANDOLPH:

12

13

two questions.

If I may, I think you’ve asked

I’d like to answer them both.

One, the Corn Products case is a labeling

14
15

case.

Justice Pitney’s opinion has one paragraph that

16

talks about misbranding and the state's right to control

17

it.

It was a state case, it was a state regulation.
The Court has said -- Justice Eehnquist,

18
19

indeed, you wrote the opinion in the PruneYard case —

20

that the states have more authority to define what is

21

property than the federal Government.

22

the Court said that the Federal Government has nc

23

authority tc define what is property under the Fifth

24

Amendm ent.

25

We agree.

In fact, I think

One way of looking at the Corn

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Products case is that the state was defining what was

2

property in that situation.

3

QUESTIONi

But Justice Pitney’s opinion states

4

the contention of the parties that the requirement that

5

they publish the ingredients on the labels amounted to a

6

taking of their property.

7

MB. RANDOLPH*

But it was a state regulation,

8

and the state in that sense is redefining what the

9

person’s property, what the company’s property right was

10
11

with respect to trade secret protection.
Two, in the taking area the Court has always

12

made an exception -- and I believe again in Justice

13

Behnquist’s dissent in the Penn Central case the Court

14

talks about this or the dissenters talk about it -- for

15

noxious use cases.

16

Corn Products was a mislabeling, misbranding,

17

adulteration case, and the state made a judgment that if

18

the product was not properly labeled then it would be

19

considered adulterated and misbranded, and that is the

20

basis on which the opinion went off.

21

labeling case.

22

it would be very difficult to see how 150 volumes

Several reasons.

a condition of engaging in interstate commerce, because

once the Court holds that then we have no Fifth

20

But this is archtypical of the kind of

that reflect a change in the law that affects a whole

11

burdens have been adjusted.
