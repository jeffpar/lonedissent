CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Moors, you may

0PM ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. MOORE, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

9

MR. MOORE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
This is the second time that this case comes
before the Court.

It is an individual employment, race,

10

disparate treatment case brought under Title VII of the

11

Civil Rights Act of 1964.

12

The petitioner, Westinghouse Corporation, is

13

concerned with this case as other employers, because it

14

involves a very important management right to achieve

15

productivity in a manufacturing operation by the use of

16

a fair, progressive, uniform, disciplinary system

17

applied by employees' immediatcr supervisor, without

18

disparate treatment based upon race, sex, color, or

19

national origin.

20

As this Court has said in Furnco Construction

21

Corporation v. Waters, courts are generally less

22

competent than employers to restructure business

23

practices and, unless mandated to do so by Congress,

24

they should not attempt it.

25

This particular case centers around one single

3

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 62S4300

1

job disqualification of one employee in the plant in

2

1971 in a Westinghouse light bulb manufacturing plant.

3

It is net a termination case.

4

terminated from employment, but the employee was reduced

5

from a higher-rated pay job to a lower-rated pay job

6

because of poor productivity and excessive wasted

7

product, as determined by her immediate supervisor.

8

With the Court's permission — and I have

9

The employee was not

mentioned this to opposing counsel — the trial judge

10

did take a tour of the plant in order to see the various

11

job operations that were involved -in this particular

12

lady's job itself.

13

While the exhibits were not made — while

14

th ese were not made exhibits to the trial record, the

15

judge did observe what this lady actually did, and I

10

thought it would be helpful to just briefly demonstrate

17

that for the Court.

18

QUESTION*

19
20

You mean they're not part of the

record?
MR. MOORE*

They are not part of the record as

21

an exhibit.

The judge did see it in the plant when he

22

took the tour, but he did not want to make these as

23

exhibits to the record.

24

QUESTION*

25

MR. MOOREs

Was it offered in evidence.
No, sir.

QUESTION;

Then I 'in a little puzzled by why we

2

should look at them at all, even if the judge offered to

3

look at them.

4

HR. y00RE:

I just simply wanted to provide a

5

visual aid for the Court to observe what the particular

6

job employee's job operation was, but I will —

7
8
9

QUESTION;

As a visual aid, does your friend

agree or not?
HR. MURPHY;

I have no objection.

10

QUESTION;

You have no objection?

11

Well I, for one, do.

I object to

QUESTION;

Well, if it’s a stipulated item,

that alters the situation.
You may leave them with the clerk and the
members of the Court will decide —
MR. MOORE;

Because of Mr. Justice Marshall's

expression of objection. I'll refrain from doing it.
I would like to point out that in this

20

particular case, the supervisor who was involved in

21

giving the counseling sessions to the employee befor the

22

disqualification occurred, gave five performance

23

counseling reprimands to the particular employee over a

24

five-week period from March 9 until April

25

five separate meetings.

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 6284300

1

I would request the Court to direct its

2

attention to petitioner’s exhibits 37 through 40, which

3

are at

4

These notes were recorded by the supervisor at the time

5

that he had the counseling sessions with the lady at her

6

work station.

7

pages 296 through 311 of the Joint Appendix.

The problems that Supervisor Turnage, the

8

immediate supervisor, was having with this employee was

9

that when she inserted the filiament into the light bulb

10

and it was sealed — her job was a sealex operator -- it

11

resulted in too many of the little filiament wires at

12

the bottom of the light bulb being burned, which was her

13

responsibility to see that they were not burned so that

14

they later could be joined to a mount or base on the

15

light bulb and give a good light bulb which could be

16

sold.

17

QUESTION;

18

ME. MOORE;

19

QUESTION;

Mr. Moore?
Yes, Your —
Which of the three questions

20

presented in the writ of certiorari is this part of your

21

argument addressed to?

22

MR. MOORE;

This pertains to the portion

23

concerning that the court should have looked at the

24

evidence concerning the supervisor’s reasons for the job

25

disqualification and should have focused in upon his

6

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

particular reasons.

2

He credited this testimony of Supervisor

3

Turnage, but then he then went and looked at other

4

generalized evidence to find pretext.

5

both of our arguments, the argument on what should be

6

the plaintiff's burden of persuasion at the pretext

7

stage of a Title VII case, and also the argument that it

8

is a clearly erroneous finding of fact because the trial

9

judge credited Supervisor Turnage and found that the

This deals with

10

reasons that he put forth in his note as a result of the

11

counseling sessions were not to be disbelieved.

12

credited all that testimony.

13

And he

We state that once that occurred, it was error

14

for the trial judge to then turn to hiring statistics,

15

promotion to management, job statistics, discharge

16

statistics, in order to find pretext at the third stage

17

of the plaintiff's burden of proof in an individual

18

disparate treatment case.

19

QUESTION«

This part of your argument, then,

20

doesn’t go to your point 3; that the defendant can

21

overcome a finding of discrimination by showing that

22

discharge would have been made anyway.

23

HR. K00RE:

24

The trial judge, in his second opinion, found

25

No, sir.

MR. MOORE;

So the answer to my question is yes.
Sir?
Prior thereto, she had at least one

time been noted as being satisfactory.

However, the immediate

Yes, Your Honor.
That was the question I asked.
Yes, sir.
But it was a different supervisor?
It was a different supervisor,

Your Honor.
She had three supervisors before she was

24

finally terminated.

The last two, however, had found

25

problems with her productivity.

And the trial judge

noted

2

that.

But the trial judge —

QUESTION:

Before you get into that, could I

3

ask one question?

You called our attention to the

4

exhibits at page 299 of the Joint Appendix, which shows

5

the 159 burned wires in her shift and 71 and 78 in the

6

other two shifts.
Can you tell me what the figure in the

7

8

right-hand column is that says "Production, 7104, 5952,"

9

and so forth?

10

what is that?

11

Does that mean the number of bulbs, or

Mr. Justice Stevens, I am not sure

particular shift or not

3

QUESTION;

Well, so far, it sounds like you're

4

just arguing the evidence as to whether the plaintiff in

5

this case sustained her burden of proof.

6
7

Is there some legal error you're complaining
of?

8

MR. MOORE;

9

The legal area is that the trial court at the

12

the evidence and proceed to a new level of specificity,

Of course, you can argue the facts if you

MR. MOORE:

We have two arguments.

14

disparate treatment pretext stage of an individual

15

employment decision, you will find, we submit, that

16

while there's some evidence to support the trial judge,

17

that evidence on the record as a whole will lead, we

18

feel and submit to the Court, with a clear and definite

19

conviction under United States v. United States Gypsum

20

Company, that a mistake has been committed because the

21

trial judge found that the supervisor --

But you're arguing against two

courts now, aren't you?
MR. MOORE:

Yes, sir; that's correct.

The reason given by the

Maybe, as a matter of fact, he

It*s a mixed question of law and

I think, when you reach the pretext stage of one's
If you use the wrong type of evidence,

10

that's a legal error, I think.

The evidence that he

11

chose to use to find pretext dealt with unrelated

12

matters that weren't causally related.

13

This Court has said that these cases should be

14

tried like any other lawsuit, and I've always understood

15

that there should be some proximate causation between

16

the faulting act and the damage.
QUESTION*

17

Yes, but the question really is

18

what sort of evidence you're going to use to deduce such

19

a conclusion.
Now, supposing the trial judge in this case

20
21

had said, "I can't find anything that will squarely say

22

that the supervisor's actions here had a racial animus

23

to them."

24

Arnold 's first opinion talks about a woman who had

25

represented a number of blacks who had employment

But, in nine other incidents, such as Judge

14

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

problems, and he had concluded that she was a credible

2

witness, and there was evidence of disrimination in the

3

case of other people.

4

New, can't a trial judge say, in view of what

5

I'm convinced was discrimination in nine other

6

instances, I’m going to infer from thes facts that there

7

was discrimination here?

8

MR. MOOREs

No, sir.

I do not think that

should be the burdentof the employer, to have to prevail
10

in one individual case, based on one set of facts, by

11

being able to show that it had absolutely nothing

12

whatsoever to do with the other instances of alleged

13

racial discrimination.

14

In that particular --

15

QUESTION*

Well, I don’t think that’s putting

18

a burden on the employer.

17

a finder of fact, if he finds very credible, believable

18

evidence of discrimination in nine other employment

1

actions, even though he doesn’t find the same kind of

20

"smoking gun" evidence in the tenth, he can infer from

21

the nine other cases that perhaps involve nine other

22

supervisors, that there may have been an overall policy

23

in the plant.

24
25

MR. MOOREs

I think it’s just saying that

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if it were

a pattern practice case, I would agree with Your Honor

15

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) S2S-0300

1

But in that particular employee who testified, she was

2

not hired until after this employment decision involving

3

the respondent hai already been made by another

4

superv isor.

5

She had been supervised by Supervisor Clinton

6

Turnage, the same supervisor who performed the

7

disqualification decision, and she testified as to no

8

racial discriminatory acts by him.

9

What I’m saying is that, if what Your Honor

10

says is true, then Supervisor Turnage could never

11

legally, under Title VII, make a-legitimate decision

12

based on business reasons to disqualify --

13

QUESTIONi

Oh, yes, he could.

All he would

14

have to do is convince the judge of it.

There wouldn’t

15

be any rule of law that would prevent him from that, if

16

the judge really believed him.

17

MR. MOOREi

And that’s — and Judge Arnold

18

said at page — Footnote 5 of his decision — "I have

19

read and reread Mr. Turnage's testimony.

20

reason to disbelieve any of it."

21

There is no

We felt at that point, that that should end

22

the matter, that he did believe Supervisor Turnage; that

23

Supervisor Turnage acted in good faith with lawful

24

reasons, and that he documented his decisions, and that

25

there was a production problem.

Yes,

Your Honor.

You had to discount the employer’s

You had to say it really was a phony.

8

MR. MOORE:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And I suppose if you say it’s a

10

phony, does that mean that that reason played no part at

11

all in the discharge, to say it’s pretextual?

12

it does, doesn’t it?

13

MR. MOORE:

14

QUESTION:

I suppose

Yes.
Well, if it does, you can't rely on

15

the Mt. Healthy analysis either, can you?

16

one of your submissions — one of your submissions is

17

that you should go through the Mt. Healthy routine.

18
19
20

MR. MOORE:

That’s correct.

Which is in

Like in a union

case where union activities are involved.
QUESTION:

But if the employer’s reason is a

21

pretextual one, you would think maybe it didn’t play any,,

22

part at all in the discharge.

23

MR. MOORE:

That would be correct.

But the

24

judge did not find that Supervisor Turnage's reason was

25

pretextual, and I submit that the employee herself did

least as of that date, the company records indicated

that Ms. Vaughn remained qualified for the job.

What T had meant to indicate with regard to

Mr. Maynard's evaluation of her, which would have

occurred prior to Mr. Brazil, was that during the time

that she was functioning under Mr. Maynard's

supervision, she reached the top pay level that could be

So my point was that there were the two

indicated that she did — that she did reach that pay

Again, getting back to my point with regard to

faced with these conflicting assertions regarding

3

had occurred.

4

In making the ultimate determination of whethr

5

there was intentional discrimination, the trial court

7

21

22

remaining ambiguities regarding the proper standards and

23

shifting burdens which arise in this context.

24
25

Aikens raised the question of whether the
prima facie proof standard ought to be changed.

This

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) S2S-0300

1

2

illicit intent is difficult to obtain, also indicated

3

the overriding importance of reviewing the whole record

4

as opposed to the rigid application of legal rules and

rituals.

6

Burdine focused on the second stage of proof,

7

resolving the question of the employer's burden, by

8

making it clear that it was one of production only; that

9

is, producing admissible evidence of reasons for the

10

employment action.

That opinion, read with Aikens,

11

makes clear that the employer’s articulation merely

12

establishes the existence of a question of fact for the

13

tribal court and, once that is established, the court

14

must weigh the evidence, giving it whatever credence or

Now, the second,

I suppose, would be an

argument that the standard is a pretext.
MR. MURPHY:

If I understand your question

15

correctly, I think both would be appropriate.

16

Certainly, the latter involves a comparison of

17

situations where unproductive white employees are not

18

fired and unproductive black employees are fired.

19

certainly, that’s a situation in which discrimination

20

has occurred.

So

v

21

I would also submit that if the company comes

back and says that they fire unproductive employees, and

the plaintiff establishes that she is a productive

presumably, it is also the prima facie case that has

12

been made out under the assertions of McDonnel Douglas,

13

but it doesn't seem to me that it's improper to draw

14

that conclusion in a situation where you have the black

15

employee who was qualified for the job, was dismissed

16

from that job, was replaced — the job remained open —

the only reason that the defendant gave for having done

That’s my reading of the record.

No.
He may have held that she wasn’t

8

enough established in the record that she was qualified

9

to do the job.

10

Plaintiff’s contention is that, as the burden

11

of establishing pretext merges with the burden of

12

persuading the court that the employee has been a victim

13

of intentional discrimination, it follows that the new

14

level of specificity to which the factual inquiry

15

proceeds after the employer's articulation, concerns the

16

court’s consideration of the ultimate question of

17

intentional discrimination, not that the court close its

18

eyes to evidence that may shed light on the employer’s

19

state of mind or intent.

20

In Burdine, this Court indicated the simple

21

nature of the employer’s burden in meeting the

22

plaintiff’s prima facie case.

23

position of greatly restricting the plaintiff’s ability

24

to place the employer’s action in the context of his

2

The evidence adduced below showed an

employment situation of subjectivity and discretion

As is indicated by respondent's brief and the

14

District Court did not rely on statistical evidence and

15

evidence and generalized testimony in order to find for

17

the plaintiff.

18

Similarly, the

It is important to note in this context that

19

the trial court specifically found against two other

20

plaintiffs in this action, notwithstanding the fact that

21

the statistical and contextual evidence certainly

22

applied to their cases as well as to the case of

23

Ms. Vaughn.

24
25

It is equally noteworthy that even Ms. Vaughn,
respondent here, did not prevail on several additional

claims of discrimination that were raised below.
Rather, as a the trial court noted in

3

rejecting the claims of the two original plaintiffs

4

below, at the Joint Appendix, page 33?, the fact that

5

the company may have discriminated generally is not an

e

automatic shield for every black employee who claims

7

unfair treatment.

9

The question on appeal cannot properly be
stated as whether statistical or generalized or

10

contextual evidence is conclusive on the issue of

11

individual discrimination.

12

indicates, there was direct evidence introduced below,

13

challenging the petitioner's articulation.

14

As the record plainly

The actual question presented in this appeal

15

is whether such evidence will continue to be relevant on

16

the ultimate question of discrimination, or will the

17

trial courts be limited in the type of evidence that

18

they may consider in determining that question.

19

In Pullman - Standard v. Swint, this Court

20

strongly emphasized the importance of Rule 52-A of the

21

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and explicitly held

22

that the issues of intent are properly treated as

23

factual matters for the trier of fact.

24
25

The four opinions below, set out with varying
degrees of specificity, the direct and circumstantial

39

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-000

1

evidence which supports the conclusion of the trial

2

court that race was a substantial factor in the

3

petitioner's decision to disqualify Ms. Vaughn.

4

Moreover, entirely consistent with this

5

Court's holdings in Svint and Aikens, the District Court

6

specifically held, at the petition on page B-2,

7

circumstantial evidence of intent as well as direct is

8

relevant and can be persuasive.

9

discrimination is rare.

Direct evidence of

An individual personnel action

10

can usually be properly judged only if it is placed in

11

the broader context of the defendant’s actions over a

12

substantial period of time.

13

In addition to the direct evidence relating to

14

Ms. Vaughn’s disqualfication, both before and after her

15

disqualification, the court also considered evidence

16

which established that the job from which Ms. Vaughn was

17

demoted was held largely by whites, and the job to which

18

she was demoted was held largely by blacks.

19

The fact that blacks were often harassed by

20

supervisors and subjected to work demands different from

21

their white counterparts, and the fact that the ongoing

22

frictions between black employees and petitioner’s

23

all-white supervisory force were particularly acute on

24

Ms. Vaughn’s shift.

25

The court also held that blacks were

The trial court also found probative of

Wilma Donley,

2

findings in the context of the Court’s statement of the

proper legal standard as set down in Eurdine.

Significantly, on the second appeal, the

Eighth Circuit found the trial court's opinion to be

without factual or legal error.

7
8

The trial court was well aware of its
responsibility to make the sensitive and difficult
determination of an employer’s state of mind.

As such,

10

that court was mindful of the fact that other evidence

11

of discrimination during the relevant time period might

12

be probative of the employer’s motivation.

13

Consequently, the trial court admitted

14

evidence tending to show the arbitrary and unequal

15

exercise of supervisory discretion.

16

undeniable that the trial court properly considered

17

evidence of discriminatory impact of the petitioner’s

18

policies in making its determination, it is also clear

1

that it was the combination of this evidence and

20

evidence of Ms. Vaughn’s qualification, taken together,

21

which led to the holding that Ms. Vaughn's demotion was

motivated by impermissible racial considerations.
