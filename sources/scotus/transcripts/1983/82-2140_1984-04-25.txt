ORAL ARGUMENT CF CANIEI H. POILITT , ESQ.
ON EEHAIF CF THE PETITIONER

MR. FOLLITT:

May it please the Ccurt, this

10

case involves the appointment cf white males only as

11

fcreperscns of federal grand juries in the Eastern

12

District of North Carolina.

13

by Article III federal district court judges.

14

discrimination continued unabated for 15 consecutive

The testimony also shows that the odds of this

19

happening by chance are 1 in 1C,0CC.

20

does not deny this pattern cf discrimination in favor of

21

white males against blacks and women, nor dees the

22

government deny that this discrimination is wrong, that

23

it is unlawful.

The government

In response to cur petition for certiorari,
the government said that it would take steps to have the

QUESTION;

4

Would ycu agree, Kr.

Fcllitt, that

5

the — a key question, if net the key question in this

6

case is, assuming the truth of all that, which we accept

7

because it’s agreed to, its impact on this particular

8

case is the Gorton thing, isn't it?

9

MR. FOLLITT;

Sir, it was below.

Eut I think

10

that it is nc longer the important thing.

11

to focus on the judges who made these appointments,

12

rather than on the forepersons who exercised the various

13

powers .

I would like

We do think that this is much like Rose v.

14
15

Mitchell in regard to the powers exercised by the

16

forepe rsens of the federal grand juries.

17

urge here is the exercise of the supervisory power of

18

this Court over the lower federal judges,

19

that is the critical issue, if Your Chief Justice

20

please.

and we think

QUESTION;

Ycu aren't pressing a

constitutional issue, then?
MR. FOLLITT;

Nc, sir.

u

We don't think that's

necessary.

QUESTION;

2
3

Well, what if we didn't agree with

your supervisory argument?

4
5

We'll relate to the constitutional issue --

NR. POLLITT:

What then?

Well, then we'd gc tack tc the

constitutional issues, Your Honor, please.

6

QUESTION:

Are you gcing to argue these?

7

HP. POLLITTi

I will argue them only in the

8

context -- for example, the Pose v.

Mitchell and the

9

equal protection cases under the Fourteenth Amendment,

10

and what I refer to myself as the Heard v.

11

situation.

12

the District cf Columbia.

13

Shelley v. Kramer.

14

Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause precluded

15

the state court judges from executing and enforcing the

16

restrictive covenants.

17

Hodges

Herd was a restrictive covenant case out of
The companion case was

In Shelley, this Court held that th«e

Then came Heard, which was the District cf

18

Columbia judges, and this Court under its supervisory

19

power held that if it was unconstitutional for the state

20

court

21

the exercise cf this Court's supervisory power was

22

called for tc stop the federal judges from doing the

23

very s ame thing.

24
25

judges to do it under the equal protection clause,

QUESTION:

Mr. Pcllitt, was that really what

you'd call an exercise of the supervisory power?

c

I had

1

always thought that was more associated with the

2

enforcement cf criminal law.

3

Hodge was saying that a federal court of equity should

4

net enforce a covenant that the Fourteenth Amendment

5

prohibited a state court from enforcing.
ME. FOILITT:

6

I always thcucht Heard v.

You're correct, Mr. Eehnquist.

7

That's what the — Mr. Justice Rehnquist -- that's what

8

the Court did hold, sir.
But I refer to it in the theory that the

9
10

supervisory power, going back to McNabb, and most

11

recently, what has to do with the administration cf

12

federal criminal justice for a twofold purpose, as this

13

Ccfurt recently held, which is to deter illegality.

14

I don't think there's any question that discrimination

15

in the appointment of persons to
QUESTION:

16

Well, are you going to explain why

17

this petitioner has standing to require us to either

18

decide the supervisory or the constitutional?
MR. POLLITT;

19

?nd

Yes.

Well, that's why I

20

preferred to stay with the supervisory power, because

21

there's no problem withstanding under the supervisory

22

power,

Glasser, Thiel, and Eallard were supervisory powers

juries.

The three cases cf

And in each of those, the persons who pretested

were not members of the class that was excluded.
And as this Court said in Ballard, Mrs.

Ballard and her son had standing to protest the

exclusion of women because the injury is not limited to

power,

13

we can eliminate all questions cf standing, which

QUESTION;

Mr. Pcllitt, you're not arguing a

due process violation, then, I take it.

14

ME. POLLITT:

15

QUESTION;

16
17

to the community at large, to

I teg your pardon?

You’re not arguing a due process

violation, then?
MR. POLLITT;

No, ma’am.

What we argue here

18

is that it is wrong, it is illegal for federal district

19

judges to discriminate on the basis of race and gender,

20

and that this Court has authority under its supervisory

21

power to call a halt.

22

interrelated reasons, if Your Honors please.

23

first reason is the Bose v. Mitchell reason; that

24

discrimination on the basis cf race, as Mr. Justice

25

Blackmum wrote for the Court, is odious in all respects,

And we think that is so for five

7

And the

1

and is

especially pernicious in the administration cf

2

justice.

3

system .

And so that’s what we have here in the federal

And our second interrelated reason for

4
5

applying the supervisory power is that the federal

6

judges had authority to make these appointments under

7

Eederal Buie of Criminal Procedure 6(c).

8

Buies cf Criminal Procedure are promulgated by this

9

Court,

The Eederal

sc it is this Court which authorized the federal

10

district judges to make these appointments, and we

11

submit that the federal district courts are abusing the

12

authority given by this Court when they discriminate on

13

the basis of race and gender, and that this Court -- it

14

is doubly appropriate for this Court to step the federal

15

judges from exercising the power which this Court gave

16

it.
QUESTION;

17

Nr. Pcllitt, do you think this

18

Court, if it were to exercise supervisory power ever the

19

federal judges, would have several options cf hew to do

20

that?

21

verdie t?

22
23
24
25

Does it necessarily involve setting aside a

MR. POLLITT;
way to do it.

We think that that is the only

Yes, Justice --

QUESTION;

You mean they would not get the

message otherwise?

8

MR. FOLLITTi

1

We think that the message which

2

would gc out otherwise would be extremely garbled, and

3

it might be hard to understand, and we think that --

4

QUESTION i

Even if it were clearly expressed?

5

MR. FOLLITTi

If Your Honor, please, if I may

6

elaborate slightly in iry argument here, this is the lack

7

of prejudice type of theory which was advanced by

8

Justice Jackson in Cassell v. Texas back in 1950, and

9

repeated in Rose v. Mitchell by Mr. Justice Fotter

10

Stewart, with Mr. Justice Rehnquist agreeing with Mr.

11

Stewart, but nc one else has advanced it since 188C.
This goes back to Virginia v. Rives where the

12
13

Court held that the appropriate remedy is to dismiss the

14

indictment and then possibly start all over again.
There's a cost.

No gainsaying that there’s a

cost.

QUESTION:

Mr. Fcllitt, if we expressed what

9

1

you're asking, in as clear terms as it would expressed

2

in a rule adopted by the traditional procedure, do you

3

think that the federal judges cf this country would not

4

follow that rule?
ME. FOLLITI:

5

No, I don't think that,

6

Your Honor.

I think that the federal judges read this

7

Court's opinions and would obey them and comply with

8

them.

On the other hand, if I may augment a little bit

9

mere.

Your Honor, Cassell v. Texas and Fose v. Mitchell

10

were state cases, and Mr. Justice Stewart wrote in his

11

dissent, in his concurring with the judgment opinion in

14

harmless error.

17

18

except upon presentment or indictment by a grand jury.

19

And I don't think that you can just have an end run

20

around the Fifth Amendment, whereas you don't have that

21

problem in the state cases.

Nc

And furthermore, finally, if I may, there’s a

22
23

statute.

There's a statute which outlines a procedure

24

in this type of situation, and it requires that the

25

motions be made in a timely fashion, that there be a

10

1

hearing, and if the judge decides that there is a fault,

2

then the statute says that the judge shall dismiss the

3

indictment.

So that is the public policy cf this

And so -- I hope I didn't go too long,

6

Justice O'Connor, to answer your question.

Eut I think

there are a number cf reasons why it's important to

8

stick with the

Rives case.

100 year tradition which began in the

I was outlining the various reasons why I

19

federal or state, to discriminate on the basis cf race

The federal laws, Section 243 ,

And in Peters v. Kiff, Kr. Justice White,

22

three members cf the Court, held that a white defendant

23

in the Georgia courts could pretest the exclusion cf

24

blacks tc augment and implement the public policy as

25

expressed in 243

And we suggest that 243 is still on

11

1

the bocks; it has been augmented in

2

Service and Selection Jet, and the policy of the United

3

States, as expressed in these two federal laws, is that

4

there not be any discrimination, and tc implement, as

5

Mr. Justice White thought appropriate in Peters v.

Kiff,tc implement that policy this Court should exercise

its exclusionary power.

the spirit there, Your Honor, is to

by federal judges.

So we think that adds a new

11

dimension to the other cases.

12

QUESTION i

One other reason that concerned me

13

about your reliance on 243, I suppose there’s an element

14

of intent required to prove violation of that statute.
ME. POLLITT;

15

We don’t think that anyone -- sc

16

far as

17

be faulty, but I think in ex parte Virginia, the

18

Virginia judge was the last person indicted under 243.

19

Sc there’s no case law on it, and we don’t --

20

I know, and I've researched it -- my research may

QUESTION;

But I wonder, in order for you to

21

prevail, are you requiring us to hold, in effect, that

22

these judges committed a crime?

23
24
25

ME. ECILITT;

No, sir.

No, sir.

No, I

wouldn't ask that at all.
I would just ask that a reason for exercise of

<•

13

1

the supervisory power is to reinforce the public policy

2

as expressed by the Congress 1CC years apart in two

3

different statutes.

4

QUESTION;

What you're chiefly concerned with

5

is that the judges get this message, I'm sure.

6

that the case?

7

MR. POLLITT;

Isn't

What I'm chiefly concerned with,

8

Your Honor, is Wilbur Hobby, my client.

And I think

9

that he has an opportunity here to serve a great public

10

cause,

11

think that there is no conflict between the interests of

12

Wilbur Hobby —

13

as he has been doing all his adult life.

QUESTION;

You think he might get a favorable

14

verdict if he -- if the foreman of the jury were

15

properly designated.

MR. POLLITT:

I think it might make a

difference, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Pollitt, would the statute cf

2

limitations have run on the offense in the event that

3

the indictment were dismissed?

4

MR. POLLITT:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. POLLITT:

7
8
9

I would not think sc, Your Honor.

Do you know whether it has or net?
I would think this appeal would

stay the statute running of limitations.
Finally, Your Honors, I'd like to -- the Fifth
Amendment is another reason.

The Fifth Amendment in the

10

Constitution dees require a grand jury, and the ACIC

11

amicus trief points out that a grand jury is not just

12

any collection of

13

content to the concept cf grand jury, and at least since

14

1868 and the Fourteenth Amendment, that concept includes

15

a body of persons from which no one is excluded because

16

of their race or color.

17

16 to 23 individuals; that there is a

And sc for those reasons,

we believe that this

18

Court should find it, or hopefully will find it

19

appropriate to exercise their supervisory power and to

20

reverse the conviction, and then leave it up to the

21

United States Attorney on whether or net he'll continue

22

with this case by seeking a new indictment.

23

If there are no questions --

24

QUESTION:

25

May I ask, before you sit down, in

the Rose v. Mitchell context, where we're

15

reviewing a

1

state court, a state's conviction, there really is no

2

possible way in which this Ccurt could correct the

3

problem unless it reversed convictions.
Eut in the federal system, if we're talking

4
5

about supervisory power, there at least is a different

6

form of remedy that's available through the Judicial

7

Councils of the circuits and the like.

8

address yourself to the question, whether we should

9

consider seme ether remedy that's less drastic than the

10

Would you

one you propose?
MR. POLLITTs

11

Well, if Your Honors please, I

12

don't* know of any alternative remedy.

13

government’s brief and I knew cf their proposal,

14

don’t think that there’s any reason to depart from the

15

100 year tradition and the expressed statement of

16

Congress on the proper procedure here.

17

government suggests that if this Court rules for Wilbur

18

Hobby, that there’ll be -- federal judges will be lined

19

won’t do it anymore.

presented here.

So I don’t

And again, I would say that the Constitution

1

requires an indictment.

No person shall be held to

3

answer for any capital or infamous crime except upon

4

presentment or indictment of a grand jury.

5

essential to protect the integrity of the grand jury,

6

and the way to do it is the tried and true method used

for 100 years and

raised, rejected when it was raised again in Rose v.

CRAL ARGUMENT CF JOSHUA I. SCHWARTZ, ESQ.

5

CN EEHAIF CF THE RESPONEENT
MR. SCHWARTZ:

6

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

7

and may it please the Court, the question in this case

8

is whether a white male defendant is entitled to seek

9

dismissal of the indictment returned against him by a

10

validly-constituted federal grand jury by alleging that

11

a pattern cf discrimination against women and blacks in

12

the selection cf grand jury forepersons from among the

13

members cf the grand juries exists in the particular

14

judicial district in which he was indicted.
The issue before the Court pertains only to

15
16

the re medies and rights available tc a criminal

17

defendant in the particular situation, for it is common

18

grcund

19

in foreperson selection is unlawful; it is prohibited by

20

the Fourteenth Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment in a

21

federal case.

among the parties that purposeful discrimination

Any such discrimination violates the rights of

22
23

grand

jurors who suffer discrimination in connection

24

with their opportunity to serve as foreperson.

25

Cur submission, hcwever, is that the

20

1

distinctive interests cf criminal defendants that have

2

been recognized by the Court in the jury selection cases

3

on which petitioner relies simply are not implicated by

4

the narrowly focused form of discrimination alleged in

5

this particular setting.
The decision of the Court of Appeals which

6

7

accords with these cf the Third Circuit and the Ninth

8

Circuit on this question/ thus, is not as petitioner

9

would have it, a radical departure from this Court's

V

10

teaching in the jury selecticn cases; rather, we urge

11

that consistent and careful application of the reasoning

12

of this Court's decisions, beginning with Strauder v.

13

West Virginia, running through Peters v. Kiff, and

14

Taylor v. Louisiana, through Rcse v. Mitchell, and Euren

15

v. Missouri, leads to the conclusion that there is, in

I'd like to turn, if I might, to the

21

22

power,

23

abandonment of all analysis of the effective interests

24

of a criminal defendant, or cf all standing

25

requirements.

fce do not agree that supervisory

that reliance on supervisory power means the

It is true that in this Court's

21

1

supervisory power decisions in jury selection, the Ccurt

2

reccgnized, before it did under constitutional grounds,

3

that there are some interests of a criminal defendant

4

beyond those of a black defendant not to be indicted by

5

a grand jury from which the members of his race have

6

been excluded.
But the Court’s opinion, for instance, in

7

8

Ballard v. United States, points to distinctive
i-

9

interests that are implicated, the interests of a

10

defendant subsequently put on a constitutional

11

foundation in the Sixth Amendment in having a jury drawn

12

from a fair cross-section of the community, or by a

13

process that dees not rule cut any significant segment

14

of the community that is qualified to serve.
We, therefore, do not agree that you can

15
16

simply discard all analysis or all consideration of the

17

defendant’s rights and the defendant's interest by

18

placing the label "supervisory power" on the Court’s

19

decision.

20

to analysis of the interests of defendants which the

21

Court has recognized under one theory or another in the

22

different lines of cases which petitioner has invoked,

23

to look at these cases and to see whether these

24

interests of a criminal defendant are meaningfully cr at

25

all implicated here.

Therefore, we are essentially obliged tc turn

And we submit that they are net.

22

1

But before I turn to that, I'd like to talk a minute

2

about the petitioner's proposal, which is that the Court

3

reverse his conviction , direct that his indictment be

4

dismissed, and that the court start ever -- the lower

5

court to be directed to start ever and do it again, do

6

it right.
In this context, where we’re talking only

7
8

about the selection of the grand jury foreperson, that’s

9

a rather ambiguous prescription.

It appears, although

10

I’m not certain about this, that starting over and doing

11

it right, might result in another grand jury with a

12

white male foreperson, in which case it is doubtful

13

indeed

what has been accomplished.
Cn the other hand, if the petitioner's

14
15

proposal is that the case he remanded with instructions

16

to appoint a black female foreperson,

17

quite a depature from any remedy previously provided by

18

this Court, and it would be at odds with the Court's

19

repeated holdings that no defendant has any right to a

20

grand

21

He think it clear that no defendant has any right to a

22

particular grand jury foreperson of a particular race or

23

sex.

24
25

that would be

-- to a petty jury of any particular description.

And for these reasons, we do think it is
appropriate to look to the other kinds of remedies that

23

might

te available if the Ccurt deems it appropriate as

2

a supervisory authority.

MR. SCHWARTZ;

18

We do not believe that this

19

Ccurt

is required -- that is really the central question

20

in the case, because the question whether the

21

foreperson’s job is important cr unimportant is not cne

22

that exists that in a vaccum.

23

importance is the dimension that exists in light cf the

24

interests cf a criminal defendant that have been

25

recognized in the due process and equal protection cases.

The dimension of

Do you agree with that or net?
I don't really agree with that,

Justice White.

14

QUESTION;

I guess you can't.

15

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, perhaps I could, because

16

there is a factual difference between the system

17

involved in Rose.

18

state systems, the foreman of the grand jury was chosen

19

by a process independent of the selection of the grand

20

jury and was tacked on to the grand jury.

In the Tennessee system, like many

The Sixth Circuit's opinion in Mitchell v.

21
22

Rose essentially took the point of view that you

23

couldn't draw the line.

24

12/13

25

And perhaps there is something to be said for the view

They said a grand jury that was

constitutionally constituted wasn't good enough.

25

that it's uncomfortable to draw a line to say what

Put here we’re talking about a grand jury that

5

was 100 percent properly chcsen, so this case could be

distinguished from any suggestion in Ecse v. Mitchell on

a defendant's rights.

19

those rights of the defendants, which we think explain

20

the various lines cf cases pertaining tc jury

discrimination.

And sc perhaps I'd test turr to

22

Because we do not believe that the supervisory

23

power analysis enables the Court to simply disregard the

24

question of the defendant's interests, we are obliged to

25

lock at the various lines cf decisions, equal protection

27

1

and due process, that the Court has decided.
We’ll start with equal protection, because

2
3

that’s where the petitioner started.

The petitioner in

4

his brief relied first on the line of cases starting

5

with Strauder v. West Virginia, the 10C-year-old

6

tradition that petitioner invokes, that holds that a

7

defendant may net be indicted or convicted by a jury

8

from which members of his race have been excluded.
The petitioner is a white male, and we den't

9
10

believe he’s well-situated tc advance the particular

11

claim of injury that we understand to be the basis for

12

the equal protection jury selection cases.

13

tells us that the exclusion of blacks from a jury is a

14

brand of inferiority upon that race which interferes

15

with the opportunity for equal administration of justice.

Strauder

A white male simply does not suffer that

16
17

brand.

Wilbur Hobby cannot claim that he has been

18

branded as inferior in this manner; in fact, the

19

petitioner doesn’t seem tc claim that that was his

20

injury, and he seems tc acknowledge that he lacks

21

standing to claim an equal protection violation.

22

does say that the equal protection cases set a tone

23

which is relevant for this Court’s consideration of this

24

case.

25

because the analysis we advocate entails no retreat from

Eut he

And in one respect, we can agree with that,

28

1

this Court's traditional athcrrence for racial

2

discrimination or for any other form of unlawful

3

discrimination in jury selection or the administration

4

of justice.
But it dees -- we do ask the Court to

5
6

recognize that the right of criminal defendants to

7

secure dismissal of their indictments from the equal

8

protection cases has never rested sufficiently upon

9

abhorrence for racial discrimination,

but upon the

10

critical element that some interest of the defendant is

11

implicted.

12

protection analysis or the values that I'm informed can

13

aid the petitioner here.

Absent that, we do not believe the equal

•

There is another line of cases,

14

to be sure,

15

which dispenses with the so-called same class standing

16

requirement.

Petitioner has also invoked

18

Amendment petty jury selection cases.

of a foreperson.

his claim that his indictment should he dismissed if

The point is that discrimination in the

3
4

selection of a foreperson simply would not affect the

5

defendant's right to a competent tribunal drawn from a

6

fair cross-section of the community.
Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal

7

8

Procedure, Rule 6(c), the grand jury foreperson in the

9

federal system is, as I've said, simply selected from

10

among the members of the grand jury.

11

significant that the net effect is that any

12

discrimination that might exist simply does not

13

implicate or affect the constitution of the tribunal, so

14

that the concern for narrowing the range of human values

15

and perceptions that are brought to bear upon a

no narrowing here.

MB. SCHWARTZ:

Well, isn't there another matter?

I'm sure you must be awars that not often, but

sometimes, this Court has directly made recommendations

MR. SCHWARTZ:

It seems to us that there are

about the message.

21

irrespective of how this case is decided, the fact that

22

it has been decided will, tc a considerable degree,

23

serve tc eradicate any problem that exists in this area

because it will focus the attention of the district

25

courts upon their practices and cause the judges to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL H. POLLITT, FSQ.

ON BEHALF CF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

5

ME. POLLITT:

I'd just like to call this

6

Court's attention to our brief again about the

7

importance of the foreperson, where we discuss the

8

testimeny cf the 2C district judges who had appointed

9

forepersons of the grand jury, and they all said that

10

they looked for strong people who could keep 23 grand

11

jurors in line, and they also looked for strong people

12

because it's the foreperson whe stands between the

13

government and an indictment.

QUESTION:

So .the 20 judges are in

I am sure you would not intend to

16

suggest that those 20 judges, if this Court speaks, will

not comply with what this Court says.

20

MR. POLLITT:

Oh, no.

Not at all.

Not at

all, Y cur Honor.
I'd like to point out that slightly ever 100

21

years age, in Neal v. Delaware, this Court held that it

22

was a violent presumption which could net be accepted

23

that all members of the black race in Delaware were

24

utterly disqualified to sit as jurors by want of

25

intelligence, experience, and moral integrity.

U2

1

Today, if Your Honors please, it is still a

2

viclent presumption which cannot he acceptd , that all

3

blacks and women called for grand jury service in the

4

Eastern District of North Carolina are utterly

5

disqualified to hold the leadership positions by want of

6

intelligence, experience, or moral integrity.
Ycur Hcncrs, this is a very important case or

7
8

it would not be here.

It involves racial discrimination

9

in the administration cf justice.

And I would like to

10

close by reminding this Court that, from Rose v.

11

Mitchell, discrimination on the basis cf race, odious in

12

all aspects, is especially pernicious in the

13

administration of justice.

14

the words of Mr. Justice Elack, "Discrimination in the
