HR. PHILLIPS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
At issue in this case is the validity of a

9

Mr. Phillips, I think

rule adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission in

10

198C that provides the Commission with authority tc

11

reject at any time tariffs filed by a motor carrier if

12

these tariffs were adopted or published under procedures

13

that are found to be in significant violation of a rate

14

bureau agreement.

15

agreement is that it serves as the basis for the meter

16

carriers’ immunity from antitrust liability for jointly

17

setting and publishing their rates.

The importance .of the rate bureau

and not as applied, and accordingly the facts are rather

enactment of Congress in 1980 of the Kotor Carrier Act.

22

The rule was adopted in the aftermath of the

The primary purpose cf that Act was to

23

increase competition among motor carriers, and one cf

24

the significant means for achieving that particular

25

purpose was Congress’ attempt tc restructure the

operations of rate bureaus.

2

created after 1948 when Congress adopted the

3

Reed-Bulwinkle Act which conferred the initial antitrust

4

immunity on rate carriers so that they could avoid the

5

destructive competition that Congress had found to have

6

existed in the past so that they could set their rates

7

jointly in a way that would otherwise violate section 1

8

of the Sherman Act because the immunity was perfectly

9

permissible.

10

Rate bureaus had been

During the 32 years that the Feed-Eulwinkle

11

Act had been in effect both the Commission and Congress

12

had become concerned about possible' abuses in the rate

13

bureau process, and some members of both Congress and

14

the Commission began to doubt whether any antitrust

15

immunity was appropriate at all.

16

comprised on the issue and retained a certain amount of

17

antitrust immunity for rate carriers but did so only in

18

return on the condition that the rate bureaus themselves

19

operate under very strict requirements so that they

20

would be more open tc the public and provide greater

21

opportunity for competition among the motor carriers.

22

For instance, Congress required that bureau

In 1980 Congress

23

meetings be open, that the name of the proponent of any

24

rate increase be disclcsable, and that members of the

25

bureau not discuss various aspects with published

Commerce Commission Act, however. Congress did net

3

modify the Commission's preexisting powers.

With regard to enforcement under the Interstate

In its notice of proposed rule making the

4
5

Commission explained that most of the requirements cf

6

the Act were self-fulfilling, but nonetheless adopted

7

several substantive provisions designed to provide very

8

clear guidance to the motor carriers with regard to

9

precisely how they should operate in order to assure the

10

continuance of their antitrust immunity.
The only one of those rules that is at issue

11
12

in this case is the Commission's decision to adept

13

rejection, as it is called, of the carrier's tariff

14

filing as a potential sanction in cases where the

15

Commission finds after a hearing and the possibility

16

ultimately of judicial review that the tariff is the

product of a significant violation of a rate bureau

MR. PHILLIPS*

Bell, rate bureaus are the ones

Mr. Phillips, could you give

examples of significant violations that would be subject

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

to the retroactive rule?

2

HR. PHILLIPS!

Sure.

Presumably one of the

3

purposes of the rate bureau review process was to make

4

sure that the shippers have an opportunity to have some

5

involvement in the negotiations for setting the rates sc

6

that if the meetings for the rate bureaus were closed to

7

the shippers or if the shippers were in some other way

8

excluded from that process so that rates were set higher

9

than they might otherwise have been as the shipper had

10

had an opportunity tc participate and the Commission

11

were to find in its own view that if the rate bureau

12

open process had been allowed to function as it should

13

have,

14

it might well be the Commission’s judgment that that

15

higher rate should not be permitted.

that the higher rate would not have been set, then

QUESTION s

16

Well, the Commission would have an

17

opportunity when the rate is first filed tc disallow it,

18

would

it not?
HR. PHILLIPS!

19

Yes.

It has the right to

20

suspend it within the 30-day period, but it may or may

21

not —
QUESTIONs

22

Well, is this rule really a product

23

of the Commission’s lack of funding or staffing to get

24

around

25

these things earlier?
HR. PHILLIPS;

Well, not nearly so much as the

-

1

symbolization rule. Justice O'Connor.

2

problem inherent in the rate bureau process is one cf

3

general secrecy.

4

modified the rate bureau process was to make it less

5

secret sc that it could well be that violations cf the

6

requirements for rate bureaus would simply make them

7

more secret and, therefore, make it more difficult to

8

determine whether there have been violations.

Frankly the

I mean the whole reason Congress

So I think there was an inherent difficulty in

9
10

complying with the 30-day problem even before the

11

Commission's budgetary problems, but certainly having

12

less resources makes it much more difficult frankly to

13

be able to investigate rate bureau violations within the

14

30-day s .

15

Rationale for the adoption of the rejection

16

remedy by the Commission was that it simply lacked an

17

effective remedy for significant violations of rate

18

bureau agreements under the preexisting law and that the

19

adoption of rejection was a direct and efficient

20

administrative response to the peculiar problems that

21

have been created by the operation of the rate bureaus.

22

QUESTION*

Mr. Phillips, rejection is a

23

creature of statute in a sense.

24

rejection, does it not?

25

MR. PHILLIPS*

The statute talks about

Yes, Your Honor.

In 10762(e)

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

it makes specific reference to rejection.
QUESTION:

2

Sc presumably the Commission is

3

bound to follow whatever constraints may be contained in

4

the statutory creation of rejection.
HR. PHILLIPS:

5

Certainly the Commission is

6

bound by the statute with regard to that; however,

7

10762(e) does not, by its terms, make any reference to

8

rejection.

9

Moreover, the Commission -QUESTION:

Does the terminology of rejection,

10

though, indicate that it is something that has net yet

11

gone into effect?

12

KB. PHILLIPS:

13

the Court of Appeals —

16

QUESTION:

Well, that was the position of

Is there a suggestion there that

that is the meaning?
HB. PHILLIPS:

Well, that is what the Court of

17

Appeals believed that you can only properly define

18

rejection that way.

19

rejection is to cast out or to eject which presumably

20

would have something to do with something that was

21

already effective.

22

However, a proper definition of

Horeover, I do not think it is appropriate to

23

tell an agency precisely how it should operate by

24

reference to dictionary definitions.

25

inherent in that particular phrase that evinces a clear

There is nothing

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

intention by Congress to restrict hew the Commission

2

operates, and our submission is that that kind of a

3

showing is what this Court's prior decisions have

4

found.
QUESTION:

5

But does the whole structure set up

6

by Congress suggest that when there is an interval in

7

which the Commission can accept it or not and then it

8

goes into effect and thereafter there are ether

9

procedures whereby the Commission could initiate an

10

examination for the future?

11

suggest something contrary to your position?

12

HR. PHILLIPS!

Dees that whole structure

I don't believe that that's the

13

inference to be drawn from this particular statutory

14

scheme.

15

miss the basic point of what the Commission's trying to

16

achieve through the use of the specialized rejection

17

power.

18

The remedies that are available all sort of

There are alternative remedies available, no

19

question about that, but this Court has held in the

20

American Trucking Association case before that you don't

21

look down the list of provisions to see whether the

22

specific one the Commission has sought to apply exist,

23

but rather you determine whether given the mission of

24

the Commission the particular enforcement device that it

25

has in fact adopted is consistent with that mission, not

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

with any specific provision.

2

I don't believe, frankly, that you can go

3

through and find that — It might well be appropriate to

4

say the Commission cannot follow this course of action

5

if its efforts were to make superfluous some preexisting

6

arrangement that Congress has set out, but that is net

7

the case here.

8

to me that the structure cf the Act does net in any way

So in the absence of that it would seem

cavern the Commission's discretion to choose an
10

enforcement technique that is appropriate.
QUESTION;

11

What about the fact that subsection

12

(e) is part of that one section which generally deals

13

with processing of new rates?

14

rejection can occur at any time, even ten years later?
MR. PHILLIPS;

15

Eo you take the view that

Well, there is a three year

16

statute of limitations for an overcharge liability sc

17

that —
QUESTION;

18
1

But you could reject ten years

later.
MR. PHILLIPS;

20

Sure.

You could reject, but

21

you could not impose overcharge liability for the tctal

22

period.

23

Commissicn's position here is that we believe that the

24

rejection authority made specifically a matter of

25

statutory provision in

I think it is important to realize that

10762(e) is helpful but that the

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Commission also relies on its inherent authority, the

2

broader sort of notion of rejection similar to what the

3

Court held in the Dnited Gas Pipeline v. Mobil Gas

4

case.

5

here.

So we do have two alternative theories involved

QUESTION;

6

Mr. Phillips, what if Congress said

with respect to rates the Commission may do the

it may reject; it may suspend; it may held a
It didn’t say anything

10

more.

11

weapons to deal with rates filed could say, well, in

12

addition we are going to have three or four ether kinds

13

of procedures that are a little bit different than

14

anything like the three that Congress has set forth?

15

Co you think the Commission given these three

ME. PHILLIPSs

In absence of some indication,

16

I submit, in the legislative history that says that when

17

Congress set out those three that those were the only

18

ones that had in mind and meant for the Commission not

19

to go beyond those three.

20

consistent with the earlier American Trucking

21

Association case that Congress doesn’t sit down and

22

figure out every aspect of how the Interstate Commerce

23

Commission is going to perform its job and that the

24

specific reference to certain enforcement mechanisms in

25

now way necessarily restricts the Commission from using

additional mechanisms so long as those satisfy the aim

2

of the statute which is in this case the enforcement of

3

the rate bureau agreements.

4

So I do not believe that that setting cut

would necessarily preclude what the Commission has dene

here.

7

Respondents filed this suit in the United

8

States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit

9

challenging many of the rate bureau regulations adopted

10

by the Commission, and the court upheld most of the

11

substantive regulations but rejected the rejection rule

12

in this case.

13

power to reject the rate that had gone into effect after

14

30 days, the court did reject additional contentions

15

that had been'made by the Respondents.

In holding that the Commission.had no

First, the court held that the rejection

16
17

authority mentioned in 10762(e) is not restricted simply -

18

to rejecting problems in rate filing procedural defects

19

but is also available for substantive unlawfulness.

20

Second, it held that the Commission’s authority over

21

rate bureau agreements was not limited to declaring them

22

unlawful, but rather the Commission could also adept

23

sanctions in addition to declaring the agreement

24

unlawf ul.

25

The court held, however, that free or

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

post-effective rejection was inappropriate on three

2

grounds;

3

which I have already discussed\ second, the court held

4

that it would violate a statutory policy favoring

5

stability of rates; and third, the court reasoned that

6

prior decisions of this Court precluded rejection cf

7

effective rates.

8
9

first, the dictionary definition of rejection,

This Court has held that the determination of
how best to enforce the national transportation policy

10

as embodied in the Interstate Commerce Commission Act is

11

a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the

12

Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Commission's

13

authority in this regard does net depend upon the

14

express provision of a specific power.

15

legitimate, reasonable and direct relationship between

16

the asserted enforcement authority and a mandate of the

17

statute, and the Commission's rule must be upheld.

18

There is a

I’ve already discussed the dictionary

19

definition problem of the Court of Appeals' analysis.

20

Equally unavailing is the Court of Appeals' reliance on

21

the stability of rates as a statutory policy.

22

It is clear that the 1980 Act was designed to

23

increase flexibility in rates, not to guarantee their

24

stability at all costs, and

25

rejection rule in this context furthers the competition

that the Commission's

element cf the Act and does not great —

2

QUESTION:

Let me just ask you one more thing,

3

Mr. Phillips, and that is could the Commission reject a

4

proposed rate within the time provided in the statute

5

simply because it lacks enough information on the

6

proceedings to let it make a sound decision?

7

MR. PHILLIPSs

The Commission does have the

8

power to reject for lack of information although the

9

tariff filing —

10
11

QUESTIONt

Sc why does it need this rather

unusual power to go tack on an issue?

12

MR. PHILLIPS*

Justice O’Connor, in order to

13

use the power you are talking about there would have to

14

be something in the tariff filing itself that would make

15

clear whether or not there has been a rate bureau

16

operation problem, and tariff filings are just a set of

17

numbers which do not in any way give you any insights

18

into whether there may have been a tariff rate filing

19

problem.

20

of two things, either disregard the rate bureau

21

operation problems or have to suspend every rate

22

increase in order to investigate whether or not the rate

23

bureau operation has been complied with.

24

those seem particularly appropriate, and this much mere

25

tailored remedy seems much, much more suitable at least

So the Commission would be obliged to do one

MR. PHILLIPS;

QUESTION;

As I understand it, if the filing violates the

Am I correct in that?
Yes, Your Honor.

If that is true and then there is

8

an incorrect tariff filed that violates the agreement,

9

the people who file it run a very substantial risk of

10
11

treble damage liability, do they not?
MR. PHILLIPS;

Well, there is no question that

12

there is some deterrent value to having antitrust

13

liability —

14
15
16

QUESTION;

I would think that Would be a

greater deterrence than the fear of rejection.
MR. PHILLIPS;

Well,

the Commission recoqnized

17

that but nonetheless believed that — The antitrust

18

liability notion is cumbersome.

The problem with the 1948 to

1980 period was that the thrust of the Commission's

7

regulatory efforts was made in approving rate bureau

8

agreements and reviewing what agreements furthered the

national transportation policy.

There was virtually no

10

attention paid to — once you had an agreement in

11

effect — how it was to be operated.
The Commission believed that the 1980 Motor

Commission to review more carefully how the rate bureaus

themselves operate and worry less about the agreements

These are separate powers.

The tariff rejection power is simply to deal

15

with tariff filing informalities, procedural matters.

16

If the tariff is not filed in accordance with the

17

Commission's tariff circular rules, it would reject it.

18

If there is a substantive violation of the Act such as a

19

violation of the rate bureau agreements, it would

20

suspend the tariff.
Finally, Justice Stevens asked about the

21
22

threat

of antitrust liability, and you mentioned treble

23

damage liability.

24

very recently the Justice Department brought a case, a

25

criminal case, against some of the clients that I

I would just like to mention that

2

violations, violations of rate bureau procedures.

3

case was dismissed and was turned into a civil

4

proceeding, but the threat is even more serious than you

5

suggest.

6

That

I would like to begin by pointing cut three

7

misconceptions that are likely to arise from a reading

8

of the ICC's decision and counsel’s briefs;

9

the rule at issue interprets and implements the Motor

10

Carrier Act cf 1980; second, that the tariff rejection

11

procedures satisfy the full hearing requirements of the

12

Interstate Commerce Commission Act; and third, that the

13

ICC will be in a position to exercise discretion in the

14

matter cf refunds to shippers.

first, that

None of these statements are correct as I will

15
16

show.

While the ICC’s decision states that it is

17

intended to interpret and implement provisions of the

18

Motor Carrier Act cf 1980, there is nothing in that Act

19

even addressing this subject.

20

in its decision that it was concerned that in the Kotor

21

Carrier Act of 1980 Congress did not go far enough in

22

providing remedies for violations of rate bureau.

The Commission admitted

It, therefore, took it upon itself to provide

23
24

this additional remedy, which is the subject of this

25

case.

Now, this is important because of what the

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Congress said in. the Kotor Carrier Ret of 198C.
I would like to quote.

2

Congress said/ "The

3

ICC should be given explicit direction for the motor

4

carrier industry and well defined parameters within

S

which it may act.

6

the powers vested in it by statute."

It should not attempt to go beyond

7

Now 1*11 admit that an agency ordinary should

8

have some leeway in fashioning remedies for the statute

9

that it is administering, but I think that this is net

10

the case here.

Since Congress, I think we showed in our

11

brief — We have a different reading of the legislative

12

history than counsel.
Our reading of the legislative history and

13
14

what we showed in our brief is that Congress was

15

tempting to reign in the agency, and that they were

16

being as explicit as they knew how to be in that Act.

17

So in those circumstances we feel that the Commission

18

went far beyond the power vested in it by adopting this

19

rule.

20

As to the question of the procedural rights,

I

21

would like to point out that this rule provides that the

22

complaints will be filed with what is called the Tariff

23

Integrity Board.

24

There is no provision for it in the statute.

25

Now this is a creature of the ICC.

This is an employee board that will act on

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

these complaints that a rate bureau violation occurred.
The Tariff Integrity Beard’s procedures, which were
adopted by the Commission, provide that the preceeedings
will be informal, that no transcript will be made, that
subpoenas will not be issued, and that oaths will net be
administered.
New, the Tarrif Integrity Board does net
itself act on the complaint.

It forwards its

recommendation to the Commission.

But the rules do not

say what happens next.
Two things are possible.

The Commission can

act directly cn a Tariff Integrity Beard recommendation,
strike the tariff retroactively, in which case the
carriers will have been denied these procedural riqhts
that I

just mentioned, or it can start all ever again

and file its own complaint using the Tariff Integrity
Beard’s recommendation as a basis for its complaint.
But if it does that it merely delays the proceedings and
increases the liability of the carriers.
As we pointed out, while the complaint has to
be filed within 60 days after the tariff became
effective, there is no time limit on when the Commission
has to decide the issue.

The tariff stays in effect and

the Commission can drag on the proceeding as long as
they want.

All increases that were placed into effect

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

Sc what the Ccmmissicn is doing with this

2

3

duplicative procedure is merely trying — if that is the

4

way it proceeds — is merely dragging out the

5

proceedings.

6

that the Commission wants to bring this proceeding

7

within its Tariff Integrity Board rule which is the only

8

place

9

retroactively reject tarrifs.

There is no reason for this at all except

where it is stated that it has this authority to
So it just kind of made

10

up this system so that it can bring it in within that

11

rule.

12

The third misconception I mentioned was the

13

ICC’s refusal to acknowledge that it will be unable to

14

exercise discretion in the matter of refunds.

15

the best example of this is in the tariff

16

missymbolization rule in the Aberdeen case.

17

I think

That rule flatly provides that changes

18

resulting in increases which are not identified by

19

proper symbols shall be considered unlawfully published

20

and filed and therefore invalid and not collectible.

21

such cases the lawful provisions will be those

22

purportedly superseded.

23

Nov it is not difficult to imagine what will

24

happen if there is a violation of that rule.

First of

25

all, as we pointed cut in our briefs the ICC has nc

23

It

Now, there is no standard to determine what

24

significant is, but even more important the ICC has

25

boxed itself in.

Under the normal procedures before the

complaint in court and said that there had teen a

have been free to decide whether damages were due at

all, in the first place, and secondly, whether the

We submit that that

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

is the only fair way tc handle this, and that is the way

2

that your decisions in Davis v. Portland Seed require.

3

I would like to new turn to the authority cf

4

the ICC to retroactively invalidate effective tariffs.

5

I think counsel for the government put their finger on

6

the issue here in their reply brief.

7

Commission is trying tc do is create a basis for

8

overcharged liability.

They said what the

He submit that the statute says what is an

9

11

cannot create overcharge liability.

12

provision of the Ret states at paragraph 4 in the

13

petition at the very last page cf the petition if you

14

would like to follow it, "The common carrier providing

15

transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of

16

the Commission under the Act is liable to a person for

17

amounts charged that exceed the applicable rate for

18

19

under the Act."

The overcharge

Now to me this means simply that if a tariff

20
21

is on file with the Commission and a carrier charges

22

more than is called for in that tariff that carrier is

23

subject to an overcharge claim and must refund the

24

excess.

25

violations of the Act.

It does not involve this problem at all,

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

In the very next sentence the Act states -- it

The first, Your Honor, I think we discussed it

There is a recent case called the Central

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

the point there is that the American Trucking case was

decided tefcre the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.

3

Carrier Act of 1980 set new limits on the Commission,

4

and really — I think the Court said it is.still good

law, but it has to be read in light of what Commission

6

said later.

7

beyond

The Hctor

Congress said the Commission cannot go

the strict, statutory limits.

8

So, as I said, an agency ordinarily would have

9

some leeway in this, but it cannot have that leeway here

10

where Congress said otherwise.

11

made itself more clear.

12

Congress could not have

13

language of the Act, which the Commission says gives it

14

15

relies solely on this rejection power in the Act.

It

16

The rejection authority provides that the ICC

17

may reject a tariff submitted to it by a common carrier

18

under the tariff filing section of the Act if that

19

tariff violates that section or requirements of the

20

Commission carrying out that section.

21

just in there for that one purpose so that the

22

Commission can reject tariffs at the cutset that dc not

statute or of its own tariff circular rules.

25

That provision is

20

21

and/or investigate for substantive violations, and it

22

can after a full hearing order tariffs canceled

23

prospe ctively.

25

Later on the

New, counsel said that their reading of the
rejection authority would not make those other

after a full hearing.

I think it is pretty clear that if that is the
