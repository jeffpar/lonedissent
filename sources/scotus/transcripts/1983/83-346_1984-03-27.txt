ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

MS. CORWIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case raises the question of what elements

11

the government must prove in order to establish a

12

violation of 18 U.S.C.

13

statements statute.

14

1001, the federal false

Respondent in this case filled out a form in

15

connection with a security clearance process required by

16

the Department of Defense.

17

an engineer by a company that was a defense contractor.

18

In crder to work on certain projects, it was necessary

19

that he be investigated and

20

security clearance.

21

Respondent had been hired as

that he receive a government

For that purpose, Respondent's employer gave

22

him a work sheet to fill out.

On that work sheet,

23

Respondent indicated that he had never been convicted of

24

a crime and he listed the employers for whom he had

25

worked in the past.

Respondent's employer transcribed

that i nfcrmation onto another form entitled "Department

2

of Def ense personnel security questionnaire."

3

Respon dent signed that form and it was mailed to the

4

Depart ment of Defense.
Subsequently, the FBI discovered that in fact

5
6

Respon dent had been convicted of mail fraud and that two

7

of the employers that he had listed on his form in fact

8

had ne ver employed Respondent.

9

false statements. Respondent was indicted and convicted

On the basis of these

10

for vi olations of Section 1001.

At trial Respondent's

11

sole d efense was that he had not realized that the false

12

inform ation he provided would be forwarded to the

13

f edera 1 government.
Both sides in this case agree that the

14
15

govern ment must establish certain elements in order to

16

make o ut a violation of Section 1001.

17

must p rove that the defendant's statements were false

18

and th at he knew it at the time.

19

that h e knew that when he filled out and signed the

21

form.

such a matter, since the government security clearance

process is a matter within the jurisdiction of the

Department of Defense.

the work sheet?

May I ask right there, what atout

Was that a matter within the

MS. CORWINi

7

Well, I think the matter within

8

the jurisdiction was the entire security clearance

9

proces s.
QUESTION;

10

11

Sc the work sheet would be part of

it?
MS. CORWIN;

12

The work sheet was part of that

13

process, and it was really a preparation for the final

14

sheet that was typed up and sent in.

15

QUESTION;

So you could have indicted him on

16

the basis of the work sheet?
MS. CORWIN;

17

Well, I think that depends on

18

whether the security clearance process worked its way

19

through.

20

out and it had been decided never to proceed with the

21

process that it wouldn’t have been in a matter.

22

I suppose if the work sheet had been filled

QUESTION;

Well, suppose the employer had just

23

forwarded the work sheet without having the supplemental

24

document which had on its face the evidence about the

25

security clearance?

MS. CORWIN

1

Well, I would note preliminarily

2

that the work sheet did have seme indications that

— was a government document on

Suppose it had none, to get my

hypoth etical.
MS. CORWIN:

9

Well, if it hadn’t had anything

10

on it,

I think it would — and it were forwarded, I

11

think it would depend on whether the information

12

initially had been requested in connection with the

13

government security clearance.
QUESTION:

14

Supposing it was.

That's precisely

15

the information the government wanted, and they just

didn't

disclose to the employee that they were making a

MS. CORWIN:

18

Well, I think if the employer had

19

requested the information and requested that the werk

20

sheet be filled out for the purpose of forwarding it to

21

the Department of Defense, it would be —

22

QUESTION:

Without telling the employee?

23

MS. CORWIN:

That’s correct.

It would be in a

24

matter within federal jurisdiction, regardless of what

25

was said.

QUESTION;

1

Sc that the employee could be

2

liable under the statute without having any knowledge of

3

federal involvement?
MS. CORWIN;

4

Yes, that is our position, that

5

Congress did not intend that the government prove

6

knowledge of federal involvement in a case like this.

7

That is precisely the point on which the parties

8

disagree in this case, whether the government must prove

9

that the defendant knew that there was federal

10

involvement when he makes a false statement.
Three Court of Appeals, the Fifth, the Sixth,

11

12

and the Seventh Circuits, have held that such proof is

13

not an element of a Section 1001 offense.

14

Circuit here held that the government is required to

15

prove knowledge of federal involvement.

The Ninth

Now, this question is similar to one that many

10

17

federal courts have confronted in the context of a

18

number of different federal statutes.

19

considered just a question in United States versus

20

Feola.

21

question raised was whether it was necessary for the

22

government to prove that an assailant knew that his

23

victim was a federal officer in order to make out a

24

violation of the federal assault statute.

25

This Court

That case involved a federal statute and the

The Court analyzed Congress' purposes in

1

enacting the statute and it considered whether the

2

element of knowledge was necessary as a matter of

3

fairness, in order to prevent unfairness,

4

basis of that analysis it concluded that Congress in

5

enacting the federal assault statute had intended — had

8

not intended to require the government to prove

7

knowledge of federal involvement on top of all the ether

8

elements it was required to prove.

and on the

We suggest that in this case the Feola

analysis and conclusions apply a fortiori in the case of

Section 1001.

14

statute on its face simply didn't say anything about the

15

required intent.

16

We begin with the language, and here I

we have a stronger case than the Court was

Here we have a statute that talks about

19

the face of the statute that those words apply to the

20

making of a false statement and not to the separate

21

phrase, "in any matter within federal agency

22

jurisdiction."

23

QUESTION;

Eut I think it's quite clear from

Ms. Corwin, does the government

24

agree that the shifting of the language in the 1948

25

revision was not intended tc achieve any substantive

1

result ?
MS. CORWINs

2

Yes, and indeed this Court has

3

suggested it wasn't intended.

4

signified that it had not intended a substantive

5

change .
QUESTION;

6

Before

In Bramblett the Court

'48 the language wasn't

7

quite as favorable to this particular part of your

8

argument as it is now.
MS. CORWIN;

9

Well, I'm not sure that that is

10

quite so, although I would not preliminarily that we

11

ought to give some credit to the fact that in 1948

2

Congress thought it was clarifying an ambiguity; and to

3

the extent that it was attempting to do that I think we

4

ought to read today's statute rather than the older

5

one.

6

But even if the language had never been

7

shifted, I don't think that changes the fact that that

8

"in any matter" phrase has always been somewhat set

9

apart from the rest of the statute and has been phrased

20

in terms that don't sound at all in any sort of intent

2

or purpose.

22

I think that's significant on the face of the

23

statute, whether you look at the old statute or the

24

recodified version, and I think it's even more

25

significant when you look at the language that had

There you had a

States, knowingly and willfully makes a false

with this "in any matter within federal agency

9

in any sort of intent or purpose.

that, in addition to the knowingly and willfully
"Whoever, with the purpose or the

In 1934 Congress replaced that language

Now, the Court in Feola looked primarily to

10
11

the legislative purpose and the legislative history to

12

determine whether Congress would have intended that

13

knowledge of federal involvement be an element of the

14

crime.

15

point at least as clearly as in Feola to the conclusion

16

that knowledge of federal involvement is not something

17

that Congress would have required the government to

18

prove.

Under Section

1001, these factors appear to

19

This Court has construed Section 1001 on

20

several occasions — in the Gilliland case, in the

21

Bramblett case, and in the Bryson case — and on each

22

occasion the Court has noted the breadth of the statute

23

and the Congressional purpose to afford protection tc

24

all sorts of federal functions.

25

that it's inappropriate to read the statute

The Court has concluded

New, the interest in protecting federal

functions is one that exists regardless of the

individual’s knowledge of whether he is involved in a

federal functions, whether or not he knew about whether

going on.

12

QUESTION;

Do we have any cases in which a

13

defendant has been held criminally liable without having

14

any knowledge that what he was doing might be a crime?

15

I’m thinking of a case, Mike Rcyko had a column in the

16

Chicago Tribune about lying to people when they come out

17

in the exit polls.

18

Supposing an FBI agent were investigating

19

election frauds and didn’t tell the people he questioned

20

coming out of the polls that he was doing that, and

21

somebody lied to him.

22

the statute?

23

MS. CORWIN;

Under your view it would violate

I think that something such as

24

the hypothetical you’re suggesting may well not violate

25

the statute, although I don’t want to take a position on

that particular Mike Royko incident

2

important tc recall that the government has to prove a

3

number of things in order to make out a violation of

4

Section 1001 quite apart from the issue we have here.
One of those things it has to prove is that a

6

statement was made willfully.

7

case as you posit -QUESTION*

8

9

But I think it's

I think that in such a

It’s a deliberate lie, I*m

assuming, a deliberate misstatement of how a person

10

voted.

Or maybe an FBI agent comes up to somebody at

11

the bar without telling him he*s an FBI agent, he

12

engages him in a conversation, the man lies to him.
MS. CORWIN*

13

Well, I would suggest that the

14

element of willfulness which is on the face of. the

15

statute requires some sort of conscious wrongdoing, and

16

I think the individual who engages in the sort of

17

private conversation or perhaps a conversation in which

18

he doesn't expect that anyone is going to rely in any

19

meaningful way on what he says —
QUESTION*

20

But the real question, does it

21

require knowledge of anything other than willful

22

falsit y?

23

MS. CORWIN*

Well, I think net.

I mean, in

24

order to make out the violation you have to know that

25

you've made a false statement.

12

1

QUESTION.-

Right.

2

MS. CORWIN:

And you also -- the government

3

also must prove it’s in a matter within federal agency

4

jurisdiction, as well as being in many cases material to

5

the functions of the government.

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. CORWIN:

8

Correct.
And I suggest that maybe some of

those elements are going to exclude the sort of
hypotheticals that you've suggested, and particularly

10

the sort of hypothetical that Respondent has posed.
QUESTION:

11

Well,

I assume FBI agents

12

frequently interrogate people without disclosing their

13

identity, and they're engaged in very important federal

14

work.

15

MS. CORWIN:

Well, that's indeed true, and I

16

suggest that perhaps in a different setting, if the FBI

17

agent were working undercover in a business perhaps, you

18

might have a situation in which you would have something

1

you could call willful conduct, something that would

20

very likely violate the state criminal statute of, say,

21

false pretenses, and there you might have coverage

22

because the conduct was willful.

23

But I don't think, for example in the

24

hypotheticals that Respondent has put forward, which are

25

quite far from his own case —

13

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

QUESTION;

1

I agree with those hypotheticals,

2

with your view on these hypotheticals.

3

neighbor were actually an FBI agent in each of those

4

cases,

5

any knowledge that you were engaged in criminal

6

act ivi ty.

then you'd be committing a crime without having

7
8

true.

But if the

Well, I'm just net sure that's

If I were a federal prosecutor who knew I had to

make out the elements of knowing falsity and
10

willfulness, I think I would hesitate before I would

11

indict somebody like that.
QUESTION;

12

Well, what is willfulness other

13

than knowing falsity?

14

reguirement I understand you to contend there is.
MS. CORWIN;

15

That's the only willfulness

Well, of course, the statute says

16

"knowingly and willfully," and

17

of conscious wrongdoing is something that may well

18

exclude this private casual conversation between

1

neighbors, in which you never anticipate that anyone's

20

going to

QUESTION;

I think that the element

Hew about an application for

22

employment form without knowing -- assume the government

23

required all employment application forms to be screened

24

for security purposes at some defense plant or

25

something, without telling the people.

Would every

1

person who filled out, made a false statement on an

2

application form be committing a crime?

3

would .
MS. CORWIN;

4

I think he

I think that if one could prove

5

all. the other elements of the statute that, yes, that

6

would be a crime.

7

situation that is not that different from what you had

8

in Feola, in that you have federal functions that are

9

significant that you're protecting by this coverage of

10

Rut I would point out that you have a

the statute.
QUESTION;

11

But Ms. Corwin, doesn't everyone

12

know that assaulting someone is going to be a criminal

13

offense?

14

about his age, for instance, might be a federal

15

o f f en s e.

And I suppose not everyone knows that lying

MS. CORWIN;

16

Well, that may be, but I think

17

that in many cases people who make false statements,

18

particularly in a context such as that of Respondent,

19

they are certainly going to know that their conduct is

20

wrongful.

21

you suggest the lying about age; and I remind you again

22

that there are things the government has to prove in

23

terms of, for example, materiality, and it may be that a

24

statement like that wouldn't be material.

25

And I suppose it depends on the context, when

But I think that a false statement,

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

particularly in the sort of context you have here, in

2

the employment context, is not only going to be

3

something someone knows is wrongful, but is either gcing

4

to come quite close or arguably falls within the state

5

false pretenses statute, in which you may intend to

6

deceive your employer, and

7

within the state criminal statute.

that is something that falls

I think, when you consider the sort of bread

8

9

purposes, the protection of federal functions, that

10

Congress had in mind when it enacted the statute in

11

1934, you are -- it's very difficult to conceive that

12

Congress would have intended to somehow carve out the

13

particular sort of conduct in which Respondent acts in

14

this case.
And I think it’s unlikely that Congress would

15
16

have intended to impose, in addition to all the other

17

elements that the government has to prove, that

18

additional burden of proving that an individual actually

19

knew that he was acting in a matter within federal

20

agency

21

jurisdiction.
QUESTIONi

Well, Ms. Corwin, in this

22

particular case I suppose that the evidence available

23

here, the document in question which was signed by the

24

Respondent here, is evidence of knowledge, and so if

25

knowledge is required presumably the government could go

16

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

to trial with the same proof it had.
We’re here because of an instruction, are we

2

3

not, where the court said having reason to know was

4

enough?

5

assume would take you to the jury on actual knowledge,

6

isn’t there?

But there was actually evidence that I would

MS. CCRWINs

7

Well, I think that’s right, and

8

it is certainly conceivable that on a remand that we

9

would prevail in this case cn the basis of that sort of

10

evidence.

I don’t know that that’s necessarily going to

11

be the case every time this comes up, and I think it may

12

well be that -- I mean, Respondent here believes, at

13

least has some idea, that he can prevail on this sort of

14

standard, and I think it is not certain that the

15

government is going to prevail in every case like

16

Respondent’s with the sort of simply, evidence of

17

knowledge that's circumstantial that you suggest.
Now, I think in terms of the legislative

18
19

history in 193U, Respondent has tried to suggest that

20

Congress was trying to accomplish something very

21

narrow.

22

look at the face of the legislative history.

23

I think that that simply is not so when you

As I referred to when I spoke to Justice

24

Rehnquist’s question, the substitution cf the phrase —

25

the old phrase, "with the intent or purpose of

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

defrauding the United States,” was replaced by this new

2

phrase, "in any matter within federal agency

3

jurisdiction."

4

happened in 1934.

I think that's the key point that

But when you look at some of the other

5

6

material in the legislative history, I don't think it

7

supports Respondent's construction of the statute.

8

There was no mention of attempting to correct the U.S.

9

versus Cohn case.

That's surely something that Congress

10

had in mind, but I think they were aiming at a somewhat

11

broader problem.
They had some difficulties that had arisen in

12
13

some of these federal programs.

14

with false statements that were causing things like the

15

hot oil program and the public works program to break

16

down,

17

solution that would apply to a number of federal

18

agencies and a range of federal functions.

19

They were confronted

and they were attempting to find a comprehensive

Now, the Court in Fecla also turned to the

20

question of whether it was unfair to convict an

21

individual without that element of knowledge of federal

22

involvement, and that's a relevant question, I suppose,

23

24

have had in mind when it acted at the time here in 1934,

and indeed, I read Respondent to be centering his

But I think as I noted in answering Justice

O'Connor’s question, I think it is frequently that one

is going to have conduct that meets all the elements of

Section 1001, even without knowledge, that conduct is

going to be wrongful.
Now, Respondent here acknowledges that his

7

8

conduct was wrongful.

He says no question about that,

9

he intended to deceive his employer.

He just didn't

10

know that he was also deceiving the United States.

11

he poses some hypotheticals that involve, as I've

12

suggested to Justice Stevens, a casual private

conver s ation.
These would not be covered under Section

14

_I suggest that frequently conduct that falls

20

within Section 1001 is going to be either within or

21

close to the line of a state criminal statute and is

22

clearly going to be the sort of conscious wrongdoing

23

that we really don't hesitate to impose criminal

24

penalties on.

think you could have a situation, as you suggested, like

the one Respondent is involved in here, in which someone

within the petroleum, the oil company, passes on

information to someone else, who then forwards it tc the

10

federal government.
Maybe the defense is:

certifying was there was no excess over the state quota,

He'd be a criminal.

that the

I'd like to first address myself to two points

21

that Justice Stevens raised.

I also thought of the Mike

22

Royko example as I was on the plane to Washington, and I

23

think that if a federal elections official, perhaps, who

may not be enough.

13

think that under the government’s interpretation 1C01

14

could apply to that as well.
Justice O'Connor correctly stated that one of

15
16

the main reasons we’re here is because of an incorrect

17

18

that the Defendant should have — would have reason to

19

21

22

MR. HILLMAN;

8

9

Honor,

The only question is whether

The government does argue, Ycur

that even if our position is correct, that the

10

jury instruction cured any error, and we believe that

11

that is incorrect because it was an ambiguously

12

worded

13
14

QUESTION:

Yes, but they didn't preserve that

question, is all I'm saying.

15

MR. HILLMAN;

All right.

16

QUESTION;

And they're seeking reversal.

17

QUESTION;

The history of the statute is

18

convoluted, but there is a clear thread woven into the

19

statute from its original antecedent through the

20

recodification, and that thread is the requirement that

21

a person know of federal involvement.

22

1948

Since the 1948 amendment itself was

23

non-substantive, as the Court has recognized, it is

24

necessary to focus on the 1934 legislative process and

25

intent of Congress in 1934.

Significantly, the first

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

bill that was submitted to Congress in 1934 contained

2

language of specific intent to defraud the government.

3

That first bill, of course, was vetoed, but it was

4

vetoed because it failed to reach further than the

5

existing 1918 statute and to reach the concerns

6

expressed by the Court in United States versus Cohn.

7

Contrary to the government's position, the first bill

8

was not vetoed because it contained language of specific

9

intent to defraud.

10

In the second bill, the one that was finally

11

enacted, the "in any matter" language first appears.

12

The government well understands that the vetoed hill

13

required the specific intent to defraud, but

14

nevertheless the government argues that the new

15

language, the "in any matter" language, was intended to

16

be in essence a radical and substantive broadening from

17

the first bill, and indeed from the entire statutory

18

history all the way back to 1863.

19

It is our position that there is nothing in

20

the veto language, nor in the remarks of Congress, ncr

21

in the experience of Congress as of 1934 that would have

22

led Congress to abandon the long-standing knowledge

23

requirement.

24

sparse legislative history that Congress finally

25

recognized the problem created in the Cohn type

On the contrary, it appears from the

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

situation and the problem inherent in the 1918 statute

2

and that Congress therefore inserted the new phrase to

3

encompass non-monetary deceptions of newly created

4

federal programs.
It's interesting to note, I think, that in

5
6

1948 what had been Section 35 of the Criminal Code was

7

brought within the penumbra of the 1000 section of Title

8

18, and it was in 1948 that Section 35 became Section

9

1001.

And in doing so, Congress incorporated our

10

statute into the broader statutory scheme which was

11

contained in 1001 through 1016.

12

I think it’s noteworthy that in this broad

13

scheme all of the other false statement statutes either

14

on their face require a specific intent to defraud, such

15

as 1005, which prohibits false entries in bank books

16

with the intent to defraud -- that is the specific

17

language -- or in 1004 or 1011, the status, the very

18

status or position of the covered personnel, such as a

19

bank officer or a mortgagee, gives adequate notice tc

20

the person that he is dealing with the government.

21

If the government’s interpretation of 1001 is

22

accepted, it would appear that there would be no need

23

for these specific statutes, because the government

24

could always resort to Section 1001 and thereby

25

circumvent the specific statutes which either require

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

specific intent on their face or give notice to the

2

defendant by his very status that he is dealing with the

3

gov ern ment.

4

The government goes on to argue that the

5

social and political context of the new deal, the

6

background as they call it, indicate that Congress must

7

have intended to delete the long-standing requirement of

8

jurisdictional knowledge from the 1934 statute.

9

First of all, there is no record of such

10

concerns in the legislative history.

11

mention whatsoever of this concern in President

12

Roosevelt’s veto language.

13

There is no

And I would contend that if those had been the

14

concerns of Congress they wculd have been -- they would

15

have shown up in the first bill.

16

been the concerns of Congress, the first bill would not

17

have contained the specific language that it did, the

18

language of intent to defraud.

19

That is, if these had

Although Congress concededly was concerned

20

about the integrity of all federal programs and the

21

newly created federal programs. Congress in our view had

22

no reason to address a person such as that of Respondent

23

who had no knowledge of federal jurisdiction.

24

what shews that is that the vast majority of the

25

federal jurisdiction.

however, that such an action is inherently dangerous and

that the action could be prescribed under the reasoning

of this Court in United States versus Freed.
For situations which are not inherently

dangerous, Congress could if it chose draft a statute

which prohibited the submissions of false statements

Respondent who acknowledges that his conduct was

25

fraudulent.

Seme of the rather marginal examples that

have been discussed up here, I just want to remind the

2

Court that I think it is quite unlikely that you 're

3

going to find those either being prosecuted or being

4

prosecutable, because there is this requirement of

5

willfulness.
This is a separate requirement from the

6

7

knowledge requirement under Section 1001, and I think it

8

involves someone's sense of whether someone else is

9

going to rely to their detriment on the statements he is

10

making .

I think that -QUESTION;

11
12

case,

13

of the person, and the element of reliance in your civil

14

fraud action is quite different than the element of

15

willf u lness.

16

Ms. Corwin.

Well, ordinarily that isn't the
Willfulness goes to the state of mind

MS. CORWIN;

Well, but I'm suggesting that in

17

this context of false statements a person’s state of

18

mind would be affected by whether he expected that the

19

context in which he was speaking would induce someone

20

else to rely to their detriment or to give him a benefit

21

based on what he was saying.

22

I think the conversation with a neighbor is

23

one that you wash out with the willfulness requirement.

24

I would not that you would also wipe it out with the

25

"knew or should have known" expression, with that

And I would suggest to Justice Stevens that I

think the question we presented in the petition, it

would be our position that that would be broad enough to

encompass that particular concern.
QUESTION:

6

Let’s just look at the question.

7

It says:

"Whether, in a prosecution, the government

8

must prove that the defendant knew that the statement

9

was made in a federal matter."

instruction question?

11

hS. CORWIN:

How does that raise the

Well, I simply suggest that

12

perhaps in looking at what

"knew" means in that

13

question, it may be appropriate to stop short of actual

14

knowledge if the Court concludes that cur initial

15

position is incorrect.

16

but I

17

broad enough to raise it.

I don’t want to dwell on that,

think it is simply our position that that would be

Respondent has noted the veto of the bill in

18
19

1934.

I think that’s significant.

The veto was on the

20

ground. President Roosevelt said you haven’t done

21

anything more in your attempted amendment here than is

22

on the books now, and besides, you’ve reduced the

23

penalties.

24

I think, looked pretty carefully at the language it was

25

using when it then enacted the till that became law.

Congress went back to the drawing board and,

And I would note again that there is

while

2

Congress was clearly interested in reaching the problem

3

that was presented by the Cchn decision, the discussion

4

on thefloor does not have -- or in committee, does not

5

relate, does net mention Cchn, and dees not even frame

6

things in terms of monetary versus non-monetary interest

7

of the government.

8

The discussion was in terms of affording broad
protection to some pretty expansive programs and to

10

closing all the loopholes that had been creating these

11

practical problems for the government.

12

Respondent suggests that intermediary cases

13

are a new thing.

14

if you look at the New Deal programs, they were using

15

state governments under the public works program to

16

administer some of those programs.

always have the situation that was discussed earlier, in

18

which an employee forwards information to another

employee within the organization.

I don’t think that’s so.

I think even

But the state cases call to mind the problems

21

that have arisen in the other cases that have raised

22

this issue, and that is the programs like Kedicaid, in

which individuals make statements to state agencies that

are then forwarded to federal agencies and are the

purpose -- are the basis for providing federal funding.

Justice O’Connor’s point, it is not always easy to prove
