CRAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. EASTERBRCOK, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MB. EASTERBROOKs

Hr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court;
10

The question in this case is whether an

11

arrangement by which a hospital obtains full-time

12

services of four anesthesiologists in exchange for a

13

promise not to admit others to practice there is a tying

14

unlawful per se under the Sherman Act.

15

The first contract was signed in

1971 when

16

East Jefferson General Hospital opened.

Dr. Roux

17

pledged to work, full time in the hospital for a year.

18

The hospital pledged to give him all of the

1

hospital business.

20

Roux to hire, fire, supervise and train the nurse

21

anesthetists at the hospital and to run the hospital's

22

department of anesthesia.

23

The contract also called for Dr.

The contract was extended year by year until

24

1976 when a new five-year agreement was signed.

25

time of trial Roux and Associations, four

By the

1

anesthesiologists, were supervising 14 operating rccirs.

2

Respondent attacked this arrangement as a tying because

3

a patient could not use the hospital's operating rooms

4

without taking one of the hospital's anesthesiologists.

5

After a trial the District Court held for the

6

hospital.

The Court concluded that the hospital faced

7

competition from many other local hospitals and could

8

not charge a monopoly premium for its services without

9

driving patients away plus it found no market power or

10

any other source of dominance, and it held that under

11

the rule of reason the contract is pro-competitive,

12 beneficial and lawful.
The Fifth Circuit reversed.

13

It found that

14

operating rooms and anesthesia are separate products,

15

and then it concluded that although the market is not

16

concentrated and although under traditional standards of

17

market power — There would be none in this case — the

18

arrangement nonetheless was unlawful per se because cf

19

generic imperfections in the market for medical

20

services.

21

The Court of Appeals observed that many

22

patients are insured.

23

hospitals near their home and that there is a lack of

24

perfect information in the market.

25

*any patients would like to use

Consequently according to the Court of Appeals

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the hospital had market power and the per se rule

2

against tyings applied.

3

hospital’s arguments about pro-competitive benefits from

4

this/ arrangement, the Court of Appeals simply observed

5

that because the per se rule had been invoked these

6

benefits could be considered only if this contract was

7

the least restrictive alternative to arrange them, and

8

the Court held that it was not.

When the Court turned to the

The arguments we make in our brief about this

9

10

subject really boil down to three;

no tie, no market

11

power and no enhancement of market power.

12

to take them up in that order.

I would like

Our basic proposition is that an arrangement

13
14

such as this is best analyzed as an exclusive dealing or

15

employment contract and not as a tying.

16

this you can think of a continuum by which hospital

17

services can be arranged.

To understand

At one end of that continuum is the perfectly

18
19

open hospital in which all qualified professionals may

20

practice.

21

anesthesiologists want to practice in East Jefferson

22

General Hospital they may dc sc, and if there are more

23

anesthesiologists who want to work there and there is

24

work to be had they will all work part time.

25

clearly would be lawful.

If 8 anesthesiologists or 1U

Many hospitals are operated in exactly that

1

way.

3

similar to the group health association here in the

4

District of Columbia.

5
6

At the other end is group practice of medicine

Such a group practice is closed on all sides.
All physicians are under full-time contract.

7 medical services are sold as a package.

All

One cannot get

8

the podiatrist of the group health association without

9

taking its dermatologist, its internal medicine man and

0

its radiologist.

11

The only choice a patient has when medicine is

2 practiced as a group is to go with that group or to seek
3

medical care elsewhere.

4

should think.

5

That, too, would be lawful we

The Court indicated as much in Maricopa.

6

is a plain partnership in which people cooperate to

7

produce a product.

QUESTION;

You do not think this arrangement

resembles that?
MR. EASTERBR00K;

We think this arrangement

2

resembles each of these arrangements in part.

22

hospital is organized in both of those ways.

23

That

This

Some of the departments at this hospital are

24

organized like the closed panel practice.

Radiology is so organized.

1

Cardiology,

2

nursing services and many other services this hospital

3

provides are organized in that way.
Other services that this hospital provides

4
5

like internal medicine are organized in the first way, a

6

way in

particular case.

which each physician can participate in any

QUESTION:

practice example?

Hay I

ask you about your group

Supposing they include a dentist and

10

they had all the dentists in Washington in that

11

particular group arrangement and they said you cannot

12

get your teeth fixed unless you take all your other

13

services from our group practice association.
HR. EASTERBRGOK;

14

Justice Stevens, I would be

15

very surprised if we would be able to see such an

16

arrangement —

17

QUESTION':

I understand.

18

MR. EASTERBR00K:

— because if they attempted

19

to charge a monopoly price it would be highly

20

advantageous for some dentist to go out and sert up a

21

practice and collect it.

22

Washington but one said this is a very small town in

23

which

there is only one dentist -QUESTION:

I am assuming Washington in my

QUESTION:

4
5
6
7

8
9

Y es

I would like you to answer my

example assuming Washington.
MR. EASTERBEGOK;

I think

there is an

anti-trust problem in that case, Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

You mean a monopoly of dentistry

and then the — Rut what if they —
MR. EASTERBROOK:
it. Justice Stevens.

Not unless — Let me qualify

I think there would be a problem

10 if the dentists or if this association did anything
11

which had the effect of excluding others from setting up
/

12

competing organizations, but if all you see is that cne

13

organization whether it be a very large supermarket or

14

whether it be a very large medical organization provides

15

the services in one town that seems not troublesome so

16

long as it does not exclude competition by others.

17

QUESTION:

Well, of course, the issue would be

18

whether it did.

They would only perform dentistry if

19

the patient agreed to have all other medical work done

20

by the association.

That is the hypothesis.

21

You say that would be perfectly all right?

22

MR. EASTERRRGOK:

I think that would be

23

perfectly lawful, but one need not reach any such

24

proposition in order to understand this case.

25

I think if all you did was look in on one town

1

and find all you could see practicing -- There was one

2

health maintenance organization of two internal medicine

3

specialists, one cardiologist and so on -- that the fact

4

that there was just one group practice of medicine in

5

say Charlottesville, Virginia would not make that arcup

6

practice of medicine unlawful.
QUESTION;

7

Does our opinion in Goldfarb have

8

any implications here directly or indirectly?

As you

9

remember all of the lawyers in Northern Virginia at

10

least got together and agreed on a fixed price and would

11

not perform any services for clients except at that

12

price.
NR. EASTERBROOK;

13

What distinguished Gcldfarb

14

and Maricopa on the one hand, Your Honor, from Broadcast

15

Music and this case on the ether is that in Goldfart

16

that was no intergration of any sort.

17

Those lawyers did not cooperate in any way in

It was just a

QUESTION;

20

They cooperated to the extent they

21

all agreed to the same prices.

22

cooperation is it not?
MR. EASTERBR00K;

23
24

they did.

25

Broadcast Music —

That is a pretty good

Exactly.

But that is all

They did nothing but fix the price.

QUESTION:

1

Well, they did more than that.

2

They refused to perform a service for anyone who would

3

meet the price which is closely related, of course.

4

HR. EASTERBFGCK:

Yes.

5

On the other hand in Broadcast Kusic the

6

people who got together and furnished the blanket

7

license were cooperating in the creation of a new

8

project.

9

business venture, and similarly the physicians who get

They were behaving exactly as partners in a

10 together in a hospital together with the nurses and
11

others are participating in one business venture which

12

competes against other business ventures.

13

'It is true that they participate as partners,

14

charge a price and each of them takes his share cf that

15

income.

16

firm practices that one cannot get a part-time job, for

17

example, at a large law firm in the District of Columbia

18

and work part-time at another law firm in the District

19

of Columbia.

But that is exactly the same way a large law

20

An arrangement by which Covington and Purling

21

says you cannot be part-time at Covington and part-time

22

at Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering would not be thought to

23

be a violation of the anti-trust laws.
’’’hat in fact is what the hospital has dene

It has said to these anesthesiologists you cannot

business decision quite apart from a naked cartel.

fact,

9

patients would perceive what it is they are buying.

In

on the question whether you can think of this as a

Do they perceive two separate products which

10
11

they are being forced to buy even though they would

12

prefer to buy only one of them?
QUESTION*

13

Nr. Easterbrook, what you are

14

discussing now I take it are largely matters of fact.

15

Did the District Court make findings in many of these

16

areas that the Court of Appeals upset them on a

17

thoroughly erroneous basis?
What is the factual state of this particular

18
19

point you are making?

How do patients see the

20

furnishing of anesthesiologists?
NR. FASTERBROOKi

21

The District Court made no

22

findings of fact on this other than to observe that

23

anesthesiology is ordinarily procured through a

24

surgeon.

25

That is -QUESTION*

How did the District Court know

tha t?
ME. EASTEREROOKi

2

There was testimony in the

3

record

from at least four witnesses, anesthesiologists

4

and one internal medicine specialist, who testified that

5

that is the way in which anesthesia is ordinarily

6

procured.

7

Dr. Hyde testified and agreed that that is the

8

way it is ordinarily procured although he testified that

9

because his specialty is obstetric anesthesiology that

10

he has some patients who remembered him and would like

11

to be served by him.

He agreed that --

12

QUESTION;

So there was factual --

13

MR. EASTERERCOKs

Right.

But he agreed that

in the run of cases patients contract for surgery with a

15

surgeon and rely on the surgeon to procure an

16

anesthesiologist.

17

hand without finding any conclusion of the District

18

Court clearly erroneous or indeed not citing anything in

19

the record simply stated that anesthesiology and

20

operating rooms are separate products which should be

21

obtainable separately.

24
25

The Court of Appeals on the other

So far as I know it had no part of the record
in mind when it made that statement.
QUESTION;

Or any hospital but this one,

especially a hospital that had hired anesthesiologists.

MR. EASTER BROOKs

1
2

Yes, Your Honor.

I have no

idea what it had in mind at all.

3

From the point of view of the buyer, however,

4

what the buyer wants to obtain in most cases is an

5

operation.

6

is the operation he has in mind or perhaps open heart

surgery.

8

9

Fe would like his tonsils taken out if that

His interest is in having that prticular
amount of medical care.

It is cerainly the case that

10

this is most unlike the traditional tying case of say

11

when IBM sells its tabulating machine.

12

goes into the market, wants to procure tabulating cards

13

to run through the machine and puts together two

14

products at some later date.

It is just nothing that is put together at one
later date in order to make an operation.

QUESTIONS

Does the hospital in this case

separately bill the anesthesiologists?
MR. EASTERBROOKs

It does.

The hospital

21

during the time of

22

Circumstances have changed slightly since, but the

23

patient's bill would contain a separate line item for

24

all anesthesia services.

Nhat ether line items?

Elood, drugs, television

Every particular medical service

3

would be separately billed, and the reaons for that is

4

to reflect what has been done for this patient.

5

someone went into East Jefferson General Hospital and

Tf

anesth esiology.
If he went, for example, into traction for a

bill.

11

aspects of its complete spectrum of medical care that

12

are provided to a patient.

13

The hospital is attempting to charge for these

QUESTION*

What dees that figure for

14

anesthesiology cover?

15

about materials that are used?

16
17

Does it cover the service or how

MR. EASTERBROOKi

At the time of the trial in

this case. Your Honor, there were two charges that

18 appeared, one of which would cover all of the equipment
19

and all cf the professional services whether by an

20 anesthesiologist or a nurse anesthetist and
21

the ether

which would cover drugs only.

22

As I understand the current arrangements there

23

are now three charges, one for the professional services

24

of the anesthesiologists and the nurse anesthetists, a

25 separate charge for equipment and general access to

MR. FASTERBROOK:

QUESTION:

8

That is included under

That is under drugs?
Yes.

No one suggested that that is a

separate product I do no suppose.
MR. EASTEREROOK:

Not in this case, and I hope

10

no one would no more for that matter than one would

11

argue that you have a right to your own supplier of food

12

or linens in the hospital also things for which you are

13

apt to see charges appear on one’s bill.

You go into a

14

hospital.

You take their

15

food service.

16

You take their linen service.
You take their nurses.

All of those may appear as separate items, but

17

I would hope that they are not all one gigantic

18

anti-trust conspiracy.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, does the billing

20

procedure whereby they split the anesthesia bill as I

21

understand it apply to all three of those items?

22

is the procedure by which the anesthesiologists and the

23

hospital share the payment for those items the same?

the trial in this case. Your Honor — Aqain, I am

distinguishing because it has changed slightly since —

2

is that drugs would be put to one side of the bill fcr

3

prcfessicnal services, equipment and so on.
Eight percent would be deducted for charity

4
5

and bad debts, and the remainder, 92 percent of the

6

original bill, would be divided 50/50 between the

7

hospital which would cover space, equipment, their

8

training and overhead and the anesthesiologists.
QUESTIONi

9

That 50 percent would cover the

10

anesthetists, too, because they are paid by the

11

hospita 1.
KE. EASTERBRCOK;

12

No, the 50 percent retained

13

by the hospital at that time would cover the nurse

14

anesthetists, and the other 50 percent separation would

16

cover the W.D. anesthesiologists.

enters the hospital and has laboratory services

performed, obtains space in the operating room, has the

specialists.

The surgeon will be attended at that

He will then be wheeled into a recovery room,

10

employees of the hospital and some M.D.s and is finally

11

sent to his room and after that discharged.
That whole package of services is we think one

12

i

13

product, and it is not appropriate to attempt to

14

disentangle further and to require separate supplilrs to

15

be available for those separate products.

QUESTION:

Are radiologists also included?

17

NR. EASTEREPOOKi

Ch, yes. Your Honor.

as well.

20

QUESTION:

How about the surgeon?

21

MR. EASTERBROOK:

So far as the question

22

whether it is a single product for anti-trust purposes

23

is concerned we think the surgeon is also part of that

our market power point. Your Honor, that assuming this

11

is best analyzed as a tying the per se rule still does

12

not apply unless there is market power.

13

We think there are several problems in the

market power holding of the Court of Appeals in this

case.

evidence of market power simply to sell two products in

The first is that under Fortner it is not

MR. EASTERBR00K;

24
25

Yes.

Your second argument?
Second argument that there

is no market power.
As Fortner said it is possible to have cheap

credit and sell expensive houses, and that is not a

2

question of market power.

3

Court said in Fortner is some elevation of the package

4

price.

What you would look for the

5

It is undisputed in this record that no one at

6

trial testified that this arrangement raised the package

7

price of operating rooms and anesthesiology.

8

executive director of the hospital testified to the

The

\

9 contrary that this had reduced the package price and

10

there was no contrary evidence of any sort.

Nor did the

11

Court of Appeals suggest that this had raised the

12

package price of the anesthesiolcgy-operating room

13

packag e.
So we suggest that under the first and most

14
15

narrow interpretation of Fortner II there is no market

16

power in this case.
The second reason why we have arqued that

17
18

there is no market power in this case is because the

19

market is properly characterized as one of anesthesia

20

services.

21

to put into this package of surgery and medical care by

22

looking throughout the nation.

The hospital is acquiring anesthesia services

23

The anesthesiologists who have ended up in New

24

Orleans came in one case from Minnesota and another case

25

from Florida and another case from California, and it

again is undisputed in this record that there is

nationwide movement cf anesthesiologists.

3

that both for what the hospital is doing the hospital

4

can turn to the nation as a

5

or acquire its exclusive contracts and similarly the

6

anesthesiologists can turn to the nation as a whole,

7

that is, those who believe the competitive opportunities

in New Orleans are not what they might be, can easily go

to Florida.

That means

whole to hire its employees

As Dr. Adriani, Respondent's specialist

expert, testified in this case anesthesiologists are

12

like nomads, and they are like nomads precisely because

13

they lack patient contact, that they are brought into a

14

case by a surgeon as part of the hospital’s package

15

rather than on the basis of individual contacts with

16

patien ts .
Ultimately our argument in this case is that

17
18

this contract is best understood as a means of

19

organizing that nationwide competition to the benefit of

20

patients.

21

hospitals can set anesthesiologists to biddina against

Well, I can understand the argument that the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERROLD J. GANZFRIED, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GANZFRIED:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The United States contends that the Court of

24

Appeals incorrectly found that the hospital’s exclusive

25

dealing contract was an illegal tying.

This decision

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

should

be reversed not only because of its adverse

2

impact of the health care industry but also because it

3

distorts important principles of anti-trust law that are

4

of more general application to other segments of the

5

econom y.

6

In our view the primary flaw in the Court of

7

Appeals’ opinion is its fixation on labels rather than

8

substance.

9

Times-Picayune and reiterated in Sylvania that

We start from the premise stated in

10

competitive realities and substance must dominate

11

anti-trust analysis.

12

With this guiding principle in mind I would

13

like to turn to the tying cases decided by this Court

14

deciding with the Motion Pictures Patent case which was

15

not cited in our brief but which is reported in Volume

16

243 of the U.S. Reports.

17

What emerges from this case, the Motion

18

Picture Patents through Fortner II in 1977 is this*

19

That concern with tying arrangements flows from the

20

potential transfer of economic power from one market

21

into a second market.

22

Ultimately the concern is that two independent

23

monopolies will be created.

Now it is common ground

24

that we do not have to wait until that result occurs

25

before action can be taken so the task is to predict

23

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

when there is a possibility or a substantial threat that

2

such economic harm will result.
Sow as it happens the concept of a tying is

3
4

not easily defined because any sale of a multi-component

5

product or service is susceptible of being called a

6

tying even where the bundling of components in a single

7

package is pro-competitive, produces efficiencies or is

8

done for a legitimate business reason.

9

a good deal of confusion because if the line is drawn

This has led to

10

too mechanically as we believe it was in this case then

11

these pro-competitive benefits will be lost even when

12

there is little or no danger of competitive harm.
QUESTION;

Kay I interrupt to ask just one

question ?

MR. GANZFRIED;

QUESTIONj

7

Surely.

I guess you are arguing now there

is no tie which is Mr. Easterbrook*s first position.

8

MR. GANZFRIED;

9

QUESTION;

That is the first point.

He also argues there is no market

20

power and thirdly there is no enhancement of market

21

power.

22
23

Do you support all three of
MR. GANZFRIED;

those contentions?

We do although on one of his

arguments on market power we take no position, that is,

24

that the appropriate market is the national market for

25

purchasing services of anesthesiologists.

ME. GANZFBIED:

That is right.

That is

right.
First, you have to define the relevant market

18

for the tying product and then determine whether there

there is none then you have no power to transfer

22

You have no leverage that you can exert into

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

several reasons, first, because we do not believe there

2

is a second market.

3

produc t.

There is one market.

Thre is one

There is a package that has been put together

4
5

by the hospital

that should be viewed as the exclusive

6

dealing arrangement that it is.
QUESTION;

7

Well, if you are not right about

8

that then you have a couple of much harder arguments I

9

take it.
HR. GANZFRIED:

10
11

Well, I have other arguments.

I do not know that they are necessarily much harder.
The next is that even if there are two

12
13

products here and two markets, the hospital does net

14

have market power in the market for the tying product

15

which is surgical facilities.

16

District Court as to the absence of market power in that

17

market appear to be supported by the record.

The findings of the

The Court of Appeals did not find the District

18
19

Court's conclusions as to market power to be clearly

20

erroneous and so we support them.

21

Appeals did was to recognize that under the traditional

22

analysis set down by this Court this case is fairly

23

easily decided, and that is that the hospital lacks

24

sufficient market power in the market for the tying

What the Court of

analysis and the analysis that was required in the

case.

result that it did which in cur view savages an

I think the point I would like to get to is that

10

important notion of anti-trust law indicates that

11

perhaps some tightenino up of the definition is in order.

12

What we propose and is described in more

13

detail in our brief is this &

14

there is a real concern, a real threat that market power

15

in the first market is going to be transferred and used

16

in a second market is where there is ability to acquire

17

substantial market power in that second market.

18

I would like to give an illustration.

19

that a company has a dominant position in the market for

20

rubber stamps for making documents, and it requires that

21

all people who buy its rubber stamps also buy ink.

22

that the only time that

Suppose

Now we are assuming tl?at there is power in the

23

rubber stamp market in this, but in this instance there

24

is no chance that that power could be transferred tc the

25

ink market.

The reason is that the portion of the ink

1

2

market is miniscule.

3

It is so small in fact that a company could

4

not use this tying to obtain power in the ink market.
QUESTION*

5

Kay I give you a hypothetical and

6

ask you how your approach would treat it?

Supposing

7

that in this case the record showed — I do not suppose

8 it does — that there is an effective competitive
9 .ceiling on what the hospital can charge for its service,

10

but the anesthesiologists are able to charge more and

11

that the hospital wants an exclusive dealing arrangement

12

sc that they can split the fees of the anesthesiologists

13

and get part of the return that the anesthesiologists

14

get and, therefore, enhance the price of the hospital

15

service.

16
17
18

Would you say that made it bad or not if that
is what the record showed?
MR . GANZFRIED*

Well, if I can just get one

19

thing clarified and that is whether the ceiling on the

20

price that the hospital can charge --

21

QUESTION;

The market.

22

HR. GANZFRIED;

23

QUESTION;

Market ceiling.

Just a market ceiling.

Insurance

24

companies make it practical to charge more, but they in

25

effect obeyed that ceiling by getting a part of the

10 findings of fact in the District Court as to what the
11

advantages of the arrangement were, and they are recited

12

at pages 3? and 33 of the appendix to the petition.
Now the point that I would like to conclude

13
14

with, and I think it is the area in which our submission

15

may be construed as moving a bit beyond the cases, and

16

that is the notion of requirement of substantial market

17

power in the tied market.

18

in fact it is not such an extension.

I would like tc point out why

That is because the focus on whether a tying

19
20

may promote substantial independent power in the tied

21

market conforms to economic reality and has been noted

22

in this Court’s decisions.

competition in this tied market has been made quite

clear.

Petitioners* arguments are based on.

T would

Perhaps the most important assumption is that

7

8 the Petitioners asked the Court to assume that there is
9

no competition among anesthesiologists to begin with,

10 and this is obviously an important assumption becuase if
11

it is correct the Petitioner should win the case.

12

all, if there is no competition to begin with then it

13

would be hard to argue that a tying arrangement

14

restrains competition.
However, we submit the argument that that

After

assumption is not correct.

The record indicates that

17 anesthesiologists can and do compete against each other
18

for patients* business when they are able to, when they

19

are permitted to.
The basis of the Petitioners* argument or

20
21

their assumption that there is rio competition is their

view of the market structure in the health care

industry.

present themselves at the dccr of the hospital and ask

for medical treatment, and they really have no greater

interest in who performs surgery on them or who mere

by the patient.

19

important point is the patient delegates that decision

to the surgeon, and under the kind of contract that we

have at issue here the surgeon has no more choice, no

more freedom of choice, no more discretion than would be

the patient.

QUEST ION

4

MR. LANDIS;

i

Yes.
Certainly the surgeon who had

5

been using East Jefferson General Hospital under this

6

contract probably knew that he would not have a choice

7

of anesthesiologists, but the point is the decision to

8

choose an anesthesiologist does not arise until the

9

patient is already in the hospital and whether it be

10

made by the patient or by the anesthesiologist once that

11

patient is in the hospital for surgery —

12

QUESTION;

13

KR. LANDIS;

Or by the surgeon you mean.
Yes, excuse me, by the surgeon.

14

Eut once the patient is in the hospital neither the

15

surgeon nor the patient is going to change hospitals

10

because they cannot have the anesthesiologist of their

17

choice .

18

QUESTION;

As I understand it even though the

19

surgeon may not come with the package everyone else does

20

including the anesthesiologist.

21

MR. LANDIS;

Is that true?

No, not everyone.

As Mr.

22

Eastecbrook pointed out I think the cardiologists are

23

under contract with the hospital at the present time,

24

the radiologists and perhaps the pathologists.

25

QUESTION;

They may force buyers into giving up the

That is exactly our perspective.

At this point I would like to respond to the
