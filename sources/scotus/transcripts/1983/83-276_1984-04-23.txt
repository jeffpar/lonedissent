Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT CF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHAIF OF THE APPELLANTS

7
8

MR. LEEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9

the Court, on July 2nd, 1980, President Carter, pursuant

10

to statutory authority, reactivated a draft registration

11

requirement for men between the ages of 18 and 26.

12

After about two years, almost 7 percent of those

13

eligible still had net complied with the registration

14

requirement, in some cases deliberately, and in some

15

through inadvertence.

16

In 1982, sponsors in both Houses of Congress

17

introduced as a floor amendment to the 1983 Defense

18

Authorization Act Section 1113, which wculd condition

19

eligibility for Title 4 college student aid on

20

compliance with the applicant's draft registration

21

obliga tion .

22

Much of the language of the amendment, which

23

is sometimes called the Solomon Amendment, was supplied

24

by Secretary Bell, who worked closely with the sponsors

25

in both Houses.

After vigorous debate, it passed Icth

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Houses by overwhelming bipartisan majorities.

2

This case is an appeal from a District Ccurt

3

holding that that 1S82 Solomon Amendment violated two

4

constitutional guarantees, the prohibition against bills

5

of attainder contained in Article 1, Section 8, Section

6

9, and the privilege against compelled

7

self-incrimination.

8

9

There are two separate and independently
sufficient reasons why the District Court’s bill of

10

attainder holding must be reversed.

11

this is spelled out more completely in our reply brief

12

-- that each of the appellants' contentions rests

13

squarely on their premise that the law does not permit

14

aid to late registrants.

15

more than 30 days after their 18th birthday.

16

The first is --

That is, those who register

And the second reason is that even if the

17

Appellees were correct on the late registration issue,

18

this statute still is not a bill of attainder.
I will deal first with the late registration

19
20

issue.

It is beyond dispute that the Secretary of

21

Education's regulations do provide that those who

22

register late are eligible for aid regardless of when

23

they register.

24

the individual appellees in this case comply with their

25

obligation to register, the government will give them

There is accordingly no question that if

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the aid that they say they must have.
That is what the regulations provide, and that

2
3

has been the consistent practice.

4

these who register late are eligible, the regulatory

5

scheme in this as is in other respects is faithful tc

6

the statutory purpose.

7

this statute was not tc catch wrongdoers and punish

8

them.

9

who are on the draft registration roles by providing

In providing that

Congress's objective in passing

It was rather tc increase the number cf people

12

13

reminder, because in many cases the reason for

We turn then to the language of the statute,

14

and there is nothing in that language that prohibits

15

this result which the regulations provide.

16

requires registration in accordance with any

17

proclamation, rule, or regulation, and the President's

18

proclamation does require registration within 30 days of

19

the registrant's 18th birthday.

20

The statute

The apparent reason for the statutory

21

reference in the Solomon Amendment to rules,

22

regulations, and proclamations is that Section 3 cf the

23

Civil Service Act which requires registration is net

24

self-executing and dees not come into play until there

25

is some proclamation, rule, or regulation.

But in any

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

event it is far from clear that in acccrdance with means

2

within the time fixed ty.

3

And another part of the statute. Subsection

4

F(4), which is really the fourth subdivision of the

5

Solomon Amendment, supports the view that in acccrdance

6

with means in the manner required by rather than within

7

the time fixed by.

8

In any event, either explanation is

9

plausible.

Certainly neither is implausible, and under

10

these circumstances it is appropriate to consult the

11

statutory purpose, the statutory history in determining

12

the validity of these regulations.

13

QUESTION;

May I ask, Mr. Solicitor General,

14

what is the dimensions of this problem?

ME. LEE;

25

I will give you some figures and you

2

tell ycu approximately what the number is.

3

of somewhere between 350 and 380 represents about 3.1

4

percent cf these whe should register# whereas the

5

earlier figure was about 7 percent.

6

I think I can
That number

There is little doubt that the Members of the

7

House and the Senate who enacted this law thought cf the

8

statute as designed to create an incentive to register,

9

and that as a consequence late registrants would be

10

eligible.

11

view among the Members of the House and the Senate are

12

contained in the brief, and there are many on both

13

sides.

14

The ample supports for this rather pervasive

,
Senator Stennis, for example, referred tc some

15

youngster who might have overlooked signing up.

16

Nevertheless, in the Senator's language, all this

17

youngster will have to do is just to comply with the

18

law, and that will automatically make him eligible.

19

There are many similar statements cited in our briefs.

20

Finally, there is the matter cf the

21

regulations themselves.

This is the strongest possible

22

case for deference tc the administrative regulations.

23

These regulations were not only adopted right after the

24

passage of the statute, through the joint efforts cf the

25

two agencies charged with its implementation.

This is

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

alsc literally a case where the draftsmen cf the

2

statute, or one of the draftsmen of the statute was also

3

the draftsman cf the regulations, and that person is, of

4

course. Secretary Eell.

5

In short, every single guide to statutory

6

construction points in the same direction, and if this

7

statute is interpreted consistent with its purpose, its

8

history, and it implementing regulations,

9

constitutional issues disappear, because neither this

10

nor any other court has ever invalidated as a bill cf

11

attainder any statute whose applicability cr

12

non-applicability depended upon what the individual

13

would

14

then

cr would not dc in the future.
It is at least anomalous, maybe revealing is

15

the better word, that the appellees' argument with

16

respect to the meaning cf this statute on the late

17

registration issue would if successful make it more

18

difficult for them to get financial aid.

19

arguing for an interpretation cf the law which actually

20

makes it harder for them to get what they assure us that

21

they must absolutely have.

They are

This shows that their real disagreement is

2

I turn now to our second point.

3

QUESTION;

Why, Hr. Solicitor General, did

4

Congress — is there any indication in the history --

5

why did they want the registration without the actual

6

authority to draft?

7

KK. LEE:

That decision, of course, was made

8

at an earlier point in time, and I guess it was made in

9

198C, and actually was reflected in President Carter's

10

proclamation, but I would assume that it is simply a

11

readiness statute.

12

concluded that we are not yet at the stage that we need

13

to move to the draft itself, but just to a readiness

14

position in the event that the draft is necessary.

12

But punishment for bill of attainder purposes

13

clearly does net extend to any circumstance of

14

non-realization of an economic benefit which any

15

individual would like to have, and the square holding of

16

Fleming versus Nestor is that the mere denial, in

17

Fleming’s words, the mere denial of a non-contractual

18

governmental benefit dees net amount tc punishment fer

19

bill of attainder purposes, and that is all we have

20

here, the mere denial cf a non-contractual governmental

21

benefit.

22

If it was not punishment to deprive Mr. Nestor

23

of his Social Security benefits after he had paid into

24

the fund for 19 years, then a fortiori it is not

25

punishment to condition student aid to registration with

QUESTION;

2

Do we know, Hr. Solicitor General,

3

how many of that 350 to 380,000 who have net registered

4

are receiving financial aid?

5

HE. IEE;

6

QUESTION;

7

MB. LEE;

We do net.
Or are asking for it?
We do net.

There is nc way,

I

8

guess, that the government would have access tc that

kind of information.

10

I turn now tc the other two elements of hill

11

of attainder.

12

applies to non-registrants.

13

antithesis, the complete opposite end of the spectrum

14

from the specific identification that we experienced at

15

common law or any other instance in which any statute

16

has ever been held unconstitutional as a bill of

17

attain der.

18

With regard to specificity, this law
It is the complete

It is an open-ended group whose fluctuating

19

membership will be determined by events which are yet tc

20

occur in the future, and that argument does not depend

21

on cur position with regard to late registration,

22

because even if we are wrong on late registration, the

23

class affected is nonetheless one that changes every day

24

and whose composition is constantly subject to future

25

contingencies as more young men turn 18 and either

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

find as I stated a moment ago, never in the

3

history cf cur Republic has any statute ever been held

4

unconstitutional as a bill of attainder where its

5

membership depended upon events which might yet occur in

6

the future.

7

With regard to denial of judicial process, the

8

only relevant issue or determination through the

9

judicial type process, whether the individual does cr

10

does not fall within the legislative target area, is

11

whether the individual has registered.

12

completely unlike the circumstance in United States

13

versus Brown, in which the issue was whether communism

14

was an adequate proxy for -- to engage in political

15

strike s .

It is therefore

And since this statute and these regulations

16
17

do provide for the individual who wants to show that in

18

fact he has registered, this characteristic, this factor

19

also has been satisfied.
I turn finally to the appellees* privilege

20
21

against self-incriraination argument.

There are three

22

short reasons why this is not a violation of the Fifth

23

Amendment.

24

There is no compulsion in prescribing standards of

25

eligibility for student aid.

The first is that there is no compulsion.

Indeed, non-registrants

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

are no t only not compelled tc apply for student aid.

2

would he useless for them to do so because they are

3

inelig ible, and it is ret a crime not tc apply for

4

studen t aid .

It

Moreover, the privilege against

1

surely the Department cf Education can ask. whether the

2

applicant is legally in this country, because that is

3

one of the qualifications for student aid.

4

Third, there is an element of unreality about

5

the appellees* Fifth Amendment argument.

6

this statute after all is to get people registered.

7

major objective, a major theme in the legislative

8

history is that these people who had net registered on

9

time should register late, and that was a major purpose

10

of this statute, to get those who had not registered on

11

time to register late.

12

The purpose cf
A

It would be a perversion of that purpose to

13

prosecute late registrants, to prosecute for doing the

14

very thing that the statute was passed to encourage, and

15

it has never been dene.

16

that the central standard for the privileges application

17

has been whether the claimant is confronted by

18

substantial and real as opposed to mere trifling or

19

imaginary hazards of incrimination.

20

This Court said in Marketti

I cannot imagine any hazards of incrimination

21

that mere appropriately fit that definition, trifling

22

and imaginary.

thousands, probably even hundreds of thousands, who have

24

25

is firmly opposed to government policy.

One final note, and cn this I will close.

1

It

2

probably is not — it may not be independently

3

dispositive, but at the very least there is an

4

additional consideration which should influence the

5

standard of review for this Congressional exercise of

6

the spending power, regardless of whether it applies to

7

bill of attainder or the Fifth Amendment.
Last term, in Regan versus Taxation With

8
9

Representation, this Court held that Congress is

10

entitled to great deference in making its judgments

11

concerning how the nation's revenues are to be gathered

12

and the tax burden distributed among different persons

13

and groups.
I know of no basis for distinguishing in this

14
15

respect between Congress's power to tax as in Regan

16

versus Taxation With Representation and its power tc

17

spend as in this case.

18

locks them together, and this Court's decisions

19

consistently treat them as subject to identical

20

constitutional standards.

Would you think that would be the same

ME. KEPPELi

The repayment of the loan, Mr.

15

Chief Justice, is net in itself a crime.

16

Non-registration, on the other hand, is a crime

17

punishable by impriscnirent by up to five years and a

18

fine of $10,000 or both, and sc the difference between

19

many of these kinds of conditions if they are bona fide

20

and rationally related to the goal of the Congress is a

different thing.

from the case here.

This statute clearly focuses on non-registrant

MR. KEPPEL:

Justice O'Connor, this Court has

2

indicated that inescapability, and that is the rubric

3

that the government uses in describing what you are

talking about, inescapability is not required.

expiration of a 30-day period after attaining one's 18th

12

birthday.

13

or not is not the point, but the past and ineradicable

14

act exists upon the expiration of that time period, and

15

so any of these people could be prosecuted at any time

if the government changed its policy.

Now, whether they forebear from prosecuting

literal interpretation.

Wouldn't that eliminate this problem?

QUESTION:

Wouldn't that be in the best

interests of your clients to so construe the statute?

9

MR. KEPPEL:

My clients, Your Honor, do not

10

fall within the group of people who are unaware of their

11

obligation to register, and so with the threat of

12

criminal prosecution hanging over them because the

13

government has been careful not to grant immunity tc

14

late registrants, with the threat of criminal

15

prosecution hanging over them, it would not be in their

16

best interest.

Once this case is decided,

and start prosecuting late registrants, or if the

3

international conditions changed as you deserite, the

4

government could decide to prosecute.

5

the government could go ahead

And these people who did so would be

6

susceptible to prosecution.

On the other hand, if they

7

were outspoken critics of government policy, even though

8

they late register, the government would always have

9

that club hanging over their head by which it could

10

prosecute outspoken critics, and I think as long as they

11

are unwilling to grant immunity, which they could do if

12

they were serious, as long as they are unwilling to

grant immunity, the potential for criminal prosecution

is clear.

1

directly cannot be accomplished indirectly, and

2

deprivation under any form, however disguised, is

3

prohibited by the bill of attainder law.

4

And so, consequently, in the Cummings case

5

over 100 years ago the Court held that deprivation of

6

any civil right or political right may be punishment,

7

and they locked at disqualification from positions cf

In this case, we are cutting these young men

off from proceeding with their college degrees, which

22

the District Court held could only be dene with federal

24

increasingly complex society, we are cutting these young

25

men off from any number, not only of learned educations

QUESTION;

It is a punishment that can easily

ME. KEPPEL:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. KEPPEL:

The punishment -The punishment as you describe it.
It can be avoided, Chief Justice,

12

by registering, but this Court has also held that, in

13

cases like Spevack, that the ability tc obtain other

14

kinds of work or the like cannot be imposed, and

15

furthermore, in Grasso and Marketti, the Court said it

16

is not whether these young men have a right to register

17

or not to register, but once having chosen not tc,

18

whether they can be compelled to incriminate themselves,

19

and contrary to what the government suggests, this is

20

not a separate or this is net a combined argument.

21

The bill of attainder stands separate and

22

independent of the Fifth Amendment, and as the

23

government keeps urging and urging that late

24

registration qualifies you for aid, we get further and

25

further into Fifth Amendment problems,

because by late

Fifth Amendment.

The scheme of Section 1113 is

This Court

If this statute said, if you will

waive, you will get — and admit that you have net

7

complied, you will get the aid, I can see the compulsion

8

then of the provision, but if he is not to get it, at

least as to this scheme, it is difficult to see where

10

the government compulsion is for purposes of the

MR. KEPPELi

12

The compulsion is that they need

the aid.

14

that is important enough a price to pay, as this Court

15

has noted in the Spevack versus Klein case, too costly a

16

price to give up your Fifth Amendment rights, and so it

is that leverage or coercion or compulsion based on need
