ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD A. DION, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

Mr. Dion, you may proceed

MR. DION:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The sole issue that is being presented today
is the scope of the RICO forfeiture statute that was

10

passed by Congress in 1970, in particular, Section

11

1963(a)(1).

12

We will try, in the oral argument, to not

13

get into a bingo contest.

14

sections in 1962 and 1963 are interrelated.

15

the argument is going to deal with the interrelationship

16

of those two statutes.

17

Unfortunately, a lot of the
Most of

First of all, the simple question is whether

18

or not the term ".interest" in 1963 (a)(1) permits the

19

forfeiture of income proceeds and profits of illegal racket­

20

eering activity or whether it does no so include it.

21

The first thing we need to do, of course,

22

is go to the express wording of the statute.

23

many of these cases of statutory construction, both

24

the government and the defense have argued that the

25

express wording, as well as the intent of the legislature

As in

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

and the legislative history supports their respective

2

positions.

3

If we take a look first at the express wording

4

of 1963(a)(1), it is important to note, as several courts

5

have held — In particular, I would like to bring to

6

this Court's attention the case of United States verus

7

McManigall which was decided after the briefs were filed,

8

which is out of the 7th Circuit.

9

Each of those courts have held that it is

10

of interest that the actual words "income, profits and

11

proceeds" are not expressly included in 1963(a)(1).

12

It is important for two reasons.

One of the

13

reasons that is relied upon that I think is secondary

14

is the inclusion of the words in the C.C.E. Statute

15

848 which was decided and passed within two weeks of

16

the passage of the RICO statuate.

17

And, in fact, in that statute in the forfeiture

18

provisions, Congress did in fact specify the forfeiture

19

of proceeds.

20
21

22
23
24
25

However, I believe that is secondary.

I think first we have to look at the actual
RICO statute itself.
QUESTION:
in the papers?

If we take a look at 1962(a) —
Where do we find that, Mr. Dion,

Where do we find 1962(a)?

MR. DION:

A copy of it is in our Appendix

at Appendix 1, Your Honor.

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1962(a) is most illuminating in that in that

1

2

section Congress did in fact use the term "interest."

3

Did in fact use the term "income," and did in fact

4

independently use the word "proceeds."
Now, the government's argument, at least one

5

6

of the positions, was that when Congress includes language

7

in one section of the statute and doesn't include it

8

in another section, there must be a reason.

9

do not disagree with that at all in this context.

We obviously

In 1962(a) Congress used the terms "income,

10

11

proceeds" and "interest" differently, knew that the

12

terms were different and, as exemplified in the C.C.E.

13

statute, when they wished to make it forfeitable, they

14

said it was forfeitable.
The question then comes up to what is the

15
16

interest included in 1963(a)(1)?

17

about?

What are we talking

I would like to first take a shortcut.

18

One

19

of the things that the government relies upon is a

20

dictionary definition of the term "interest."

21

one of the dictionary — not' the legal definition, but

22

the common Webster's Dictionary of American Heritage

23

Dictionary definition is that it includes the term

24

"profit."

25

And,

I would like the Court to understand what

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

they mean by profit in that definition of the word

2

"interest."

3

a loan and you pay money to the bank for that privilege,

4

the interest is the profit the bank has made.

5

same context as the dictionary definition in a legal

6

sense.

When you go to a bank and you take out

It rs not the

Black's Law Dictionary defines it differently.

7

8

That is the definition that was used by the Martino

9

dissent, by the Thevis court and by the McManigall court.

10

The most general term that can be employed to denote

11

a right, claim, title, or legal share in something.

12

This is where a lot of lower courts went out and said,

13

all

14

is the something that we are talking about.

right,

if it is an interest in something, what

15

In a number of the courts, including a new

16

case that was decided by the 10th Circuit since this

17

case was submitted, United States versus Zang, has said,

18

let's us look at the RICO statute in its entirety.

19

What is it that makes the RICO statute different from

20

other criminal statutes?

21

to punish since obviously this is a form of enhancement?

22

It is a form of we take the substantive crime and if

23

they done it more than one time and other elements are

24

there, we now have a new crime which we have construed

25

in 1970 called RICO.

What is that we are attempting

And, that something in addition

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-8300

1

is, in fact, the enterprise concept.

2

So, these courts have gone to say that when

3

we talk about an interest in something, the something

4

we are talking about is the enterprise.

5

They then go back and take a look at the actual

6

wording of the statute.

7

one place in 1963, which is the source of litigation

8

here today, whenever Congress used the term "interest,"

9

it said "interest in an enterprise."

In 1962, and other than in

10

Now, one of the questions the government has

11

raised is why then in 1963(a)(1) does Congress not say

12

interest in an enterprise when in 1963(a)(2) and elsewhere

13

throughout the statute, they say "interest in" and the

14

government conveniently says three or four dots "an

15

enterprise."

16

f

I would submit that the reason that it is

17

included in (a)(2) and not in (2) (1) is what is missing,

18

what those dots represent.

19

We would submit that what Congress has already

20

stated throughout the substantive events, that it is

21

an "interest in an enterprise," that there was no need

22

to put the words "interest in an enterprise" in 1963(a)

23

at all, but that the reason they did it in (a)(2) was

24

to make very clear, not that the interest which is for­

25

feitable is the interest in the enterprise, but rather

7
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that the security of, claim against, or property or

2

contractual right of any kind affording the source of

3

influence over is modified by the term "any enterprise,"

4

since those terms are not used elsewhere in the statute

5

with the said modification.
A lot of the courts and some of the Law Review

6
7

articles condemn the courts for this, then go into a

8

question of legislative history.

9

of these cases, both the government and the defense

And, as with many

10

submit that the legislative history supports their

11

respective positions.

12

There is a slight difference, however.

If

13

the Court would take a look at the references that the

14

government has made to support their concept of legislative

15

history, they are statements, speeches, and parts of

16

the record, Congressional Record, that reflect the

17

opinions of individual senators and. members of the

18

House.

19

that passed the statute and that is the intent we are

20

going for if we are going to look at legislative history.

21

It is not the position of the entire Congress

We, on the other hand, rely upon primarily

22

the Preamble to Senate Bill 30, which was 1963, became

23

1963, which expressly limits the forfeiture of interest

24

in an enterprise.

25

Also, the Senate reports and House reports

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

which were the synopses and the explanations that were

2

given to the senators and the congressmen when they,

3

in fact, were required to vote on the statute.

4

they said, what is this all about, that is what they

S

were looking at.

6

QUESTION:

When

Mr. Dion, you say that the govern­

7

ment relies on speeches by individual senators and House

8

members and you rely on synopses and a preamble.

9

of you rely on the words of the statute itself?

10

MR. DION:

Neither

Well, both of us rely initially

11

on the wording of the statute and both submit that the

12

express wording supports their respective positions.

13

Needless to say, unfortunately, it can't, so obviously

14

there is a conflict and the question of what the

15

expression is.

16
17

QUESTION:

At that point you go to the secondary

MR. DION:

That is when both sides go to the

theory.

18
19

secondary.

20

concern and the legislative history is really a secondary

21

source of interpretation.

22

Obviously, the express wording is of primary

QUESTION:

Mr. Dion, with respect to Congress'

23

stated purpose which, as I understand it, was to eradicate

24

organized crime, why in the world would Congress have

25

wanted to exempt from forfeiture cash profits that are

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the primary product of an illegal enterprise?

2

your argument is a little strange in that regard.

3

MR. DION:

I think

Well, there are primarily two reasons,

4

Your Honor.

The first question is a policy determination

5

that really needs to be addressed by Congress and I

6

believe has been addressed.

7

of we have now punished the racketeer by throwing him

in jail.

him from his office in the enterprise and separating

And, that is a question

We have now

Now, we get to.the question of the forfeiture

13

aspect.

14

be the benefactor of the forfeiture?

Who is it that we wish to protect?

Who should

15

QUESTION:

16

to make a crime unprofitable?

17

MR. DION:

Of course, it was.

18

QUESTION:

And, if you don't forfeit the profits,

19

how do you do that?

20

MR. DION:

Wasn't it Congress' whole purpose

Well, again, there are two answers.

21

The first one is that it still is forfeitable.

22

only is it forfeitable under civil law, it is subject

23

to

24
25

treble

Not

damages.
I believe it was a question of policy of if

we are going to take the criminal out of the enterprise,

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

who should get the benefit of the forfeiture?

2

it be the government or

the victim?

Should

That1 is .one answer.

3

The other one is a little bit more technical

4

and, unfortunately, it is supposition since no one can

5

really tell.

6

I would respectfully submit that one of the

7

problems that Congress had was that when they passed

8

the first United States in personam forfeiture action,

9

they were most concerned with the constitutionality

10
11

of the act.
And, I believe that when they sent — particularly

12

Senator McClellan requested Attorney General Kleindienst

13

to answer the question of the constitutionality.

14

we are getting into the Kleindeinst letter.

15

this is one of the true reasons and importances of the

16

Kleindienst letter.

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Now

I believe

Well, that letter referred to a

different version of the bill that was eventually enacted.
MR. DION:

It was a predecessor of the 1963,

20

however, the importance of the statute — of the letter

21

at this juncture is that when Congress said, is it

22

constitutional, Kleindeinst responded, yes, it is con­

23

stitutional as limited, as limited to interest in the

24

enterprise, and as limited so that no other property

25

is subject to forfeiture.

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

I think it really came down to a very simply

2

question.

3

the forfeiture beyond the limitations which were imposed

4

by that letter that they would be getting into an area

5

of constitutional dimension.

6

it, they went into the civil remedies and the civil

7

treble

8
9

Congress was afraid that if they extended

damage

And, in order to avoid

forfeitures that were provided.

There is another aspect of the Kleindeinst
letter that I believe is important.

The importance

10

of the Kleindeinst letter is not the opinion of the

11

Attorney General that it is limited, forfeitures are

12

limited to an interest in an enterprise, because as

13

Your Honor correctly pointed out, that applied to a

14

pior forfeiture proceeding.

15

that it was included in Senate Bill 30 in the Preamble

16

to show the intent of the Senate in passing the Bill,

17

the intent of the limitation being there.

The importance of it is

18

So, it is Congress' intent by using the letter

19

in their Preamble and referring to it that is important,

20

not the Attorney General's personal opinion.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Dion, looking again at the

22

language of 1963(a) as it appears in your brief at,

23

I guess, the second page of the Appendix, what is the

24

difference in operation between Subsection — What does

25

Subsection (2) have that Subsection (1) doesn't and

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

and vice versa?

2

The Defendant would respectfully submit that

3

what (a)(1) hits are — What are referred to in a couple

4

of the cases as passive investments while (a)(2) hits

5

active investments.

6

those things which afford a source of control over an

7

enterprise.

8
9

QUESTION:

(a)(2) in particularly goes to

Does that modify all of the terms,

interest and security of claim against?

Are all of

10

those modified by the language, affording a source of

11

control or influence over?

12

MR. DION:

Unfortunately, I am not a grammarian,

13

however, several of the lower courts have so indicated

14

that that limitation does apply across-the-board, if

15

not expressly as an indication of the intent of the

16

entire section.

17
18

QUESTION:

Well, is the reach of (1) somehow

narrower than (2)?

19

MR. DION:

It is not a question of being narrower

20

or not.

21

would make one narrower than the other.

22

actually go to different things.

23

I believe that the government's interpretation
I believe they

For example, let's assume that you have a

24

situation where an individual is involved in a racketeer­

25

ing situation and he has interest in an enterprise that

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

is less than of substantial source of influence over

2

the enterprise.

3

under (a)(2), yet that certainly is not the intend of

4

Congress.

5

them from the legitimate enterprise entirely.

6

would be subject to forfeiture under (a)(1).

7

That would not be subject to forfeiture

The intent of Congress is to totally separate
That

There are other things that would be subject

8

to forfeiture under (a)(1) that would not be subject

9

under (a)(2).

For example, in the Godoy case out of

10

the 9th Circuit, the profits and proceeds were then

11

reinvested as part of the enterprise into investment

12

property.

13
14
15

That was subject to forfeiture under (a)(1).
QUESTION:

What then does (a)(2) reach that

(a)(1) doesn't?
MR. DION:

(a)(2) primarily would reach not

16

only interest in the enterprise which give a source

17

of influence, which would also be arguably be covered

18

under (a)(1), but.it also allows the forfeiture of the

19

securities, the claims, property contractual rights,

20

all of which are a form of influence that arguably is

21

not subject to forfeiture under (a)(1).

22

I think it is not really a question of is

23

(a)(1) and (a)(2) — let's categorize them separately.

24

It is a question of why are they there?

25

QUESTION:

In the —

But, surely, when Congress is writing

MR. DION:

7

Initially they did have it all in one sentence

Of course, Your Honor.

as a matter of fact.

9

Congress then ran into a problem, I would submit, in

feitable.

14

might so interpret it and to avoid that possibility

15

they more fully set forth the different categories that

16

now make up (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 1963 which was not

17

there before.

18

And, I agree

That does not make it not for­

However, Congress was afraid that someone

Actually though it attempted to make it a

little bit more difficult to understand.

didn't succeed unfortunately.

Is it correct that under your read­

23

ing, and I am not suggesting it is not tenable, but

language as though it said violation of Section 1962(a)

2

or (b).

3

deal with the possibility that (a)(1) may cover — may

4

refer to 1962(c)?

You don't really, as I understand your argument,

MR. DION:

5

This is where I disagree with some

6

of the lower courts that have ruled in my favor.

I

7

absolutely believe that 1963(a)(1) will reach an enter­

8

prising fact under 1962(c).

9

Godoy, I think, is a perfect example of that

10

or actually, to be most honest, this case, but for the

11

judgment of acquittal, would have been a perfect example

12

of that.

13

In this case, the individual was charged pri­

14

marily with being involved in a racketeering situation

15

where he, along with others, purchased property — in

16

his case, he already had the property — donated the

17

property to the enterprise, got it insured, burned it,

18

took the proceeds.

19

What would be forfeitable in this case, but

20

for the judgment of acquittal that was granted below,

21

would be the property, because the property was donated

22

to the purpose, to serve the purpose of the enterprise.

23

This is an example of a 1962(c) violation or something

24

that would be forfeitable under 1963(a)(1).

Exactly the opposite.

2

we are limited to.

3

The only thing that I am trying to bring to

4

the Court's attention from a policy standpoint is the

5

fact that even Congress across the street doesn't know

6

really what it wants to do.

7

The purpose of including in the brief a number

8

of House bills and Senate bills that have come up for

9

consideration after the passage of 1963 is to not to

10

show what Congress' intent was back in 1970.

11

that is impossible.

12

of the policy decision which Congress should be making

13

and even they at this point don't know which way they

want to go.

Obviously,

What it is to show is the importance

The reason they don't know is, number one,

16

the question of the constitutionality; and, number two,

17

the question of who should benefit from the forfeiture.

18

Are society's need sufficiently met by throwing the

19

racketeer in jail, giving him a fine, and separating

20

him from the enterprise, and giving treble damages

21

to the victims, or do we also need additional forfeiture?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4
5

MR. ALITO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As Justice O'Connor observed, Congress' stated

6

objective in enacting the RICO statute was nothing less than

7

"eradication of organized crime" by, among other things,

8

providing enhanced sanctions and new remedies.

9

It is worth noting that in the preface to

10

the RICO statute Congress, the entire Congress stated

11

that its objective was to do this and found "that

12

organized crime in the United States

13

sophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity

14

that annually drains billions of dollars of America's

15

economy by unlawful conduct and the illegal use of

16

force, fraud, and corruption."

17

is-: a highly

Organized crime derives a major portion of

18

its power through money obtained through such illegal

19

endeavors as syndicated gambling, loansharking, the

20

theft and fencing of property, the importation and dis­

21

tribution of narcotics and other dangerous drugs, and

22

other forms of social exploitation.

23

Given Congress' objective and its finding,

24

it would have been surprising is Congress had enacted

25

a racketeering forfeiture statute, but had held back

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

from authorizing the forfeiture of the illegal profits

2

that constitute organized crime's life blood and the

3

source of its wealth and power.

4

Neither petitioner nor the dissent in the court

5

below nor any court or commentator has been able to

8

identify any convincing reason why Congress might not

7

have wanted to authorize the forfeiture of racketeering

8

profits.

9

about doing so, about requiring a convicted criminal

10

Certainly there is nothing harsh or unfair

to give up his illegal gain.

11

In this case, for example, petitioner obtained

12

some $340,000 in insurance proceeds by taking out fire

13

insurance on his property and arranging for an arsonist

14

to burn it down.

15

There is no reason why he should be

QUESTION:

May I ask a question right there?

19

What exactly is it that you contend should be forfeited

20

to the United States as opposed to what the insurance

company might get back?

22

company might have a claim to this money too.

23

MR. ALITO:

I take it that the insurance

2

persons.

3

into RICO, a victim of racketeering can apply to the

4

Attorney General to receive the forfeited property and

5

can receive that property.

And, under the procedures that are incorporated

QUESTION:

6

So there is no contradiction.

So the end result would be the

7

same?

The government would, in effect, collect the

8

forfeited property and turn it back to the insurance

9

company.
MR. ALITO:

10

That is correct and that is of

11

considerable benefit to the victims.

It spares them

12

the trouble and expense of bringing suit and it also

13

spares them the unpleasant prospect of having to square

14

off in court against the defendant who may be a notorious
J

15
16

racketeer.
QUESTION:

Actually the money ends up — I

17

understand what you are saying about undesirability

18

about bringing litigation, but assuming that the rights

19

were enforced by civil litigation, the net result would

20

really be pretty much the same anyway, wouldn't it?

21

MR. ALITO:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. ALITO:

Well, Congress intended —
At least in this case.
That is correct, Justice Stevens.

24

Congress intended for both of those remedies to be available

25

That is correct.

QUESTION:

9

Could the victim bring a suit for

10

treble damages even after the government had imposed

11

a civil forfeiture?
MR. ALITO:

12

Well, that is not settled, Justice

13

O'Connor.

I would think perhaps the money received

14

from the government would be taken into account in

15

computing the victim's damages.

MR. ALITO:

That is not resolved and certainly

you be good enough to give me examples of what you think

hard to make perfectly clear what those two subsections

24

were intended to cover under your view.

MR. ALITO:

It is just

to me that maintained means exactly that.

Then they may overlap

Maintained

It could be read much more narrowly to talk

10

about an interest that has been sustained by racketeering

11

activity in the sense that only through that racketeering

12

activity was the interest permitted to survive.

13

Your reading is certainly a possible one,

14

but I don't know — It certainly isn't settled if that

15

is what Congress intended.

16

QUESTION:

Could you give a concrete example

17

then of what you think would be covered by (a)(2) that

18

is not covered by (a)(1)?

19

MR..ALITO:

I think that if someone had a

20

lawful business and fell upon financial hard times and

21

turned to’ racketeering to keep the business going or,

22

as a sideline, to make extra profit, that would clearly

23

be an interest that is forfeitable under (a)(2).

24

is much less clear that that would be reached by (a)(1).

in the language of (a)(1), the business maintained —
MR. ALITO:

2
3

I don't know that that is a

necessary reading of (a)(1).
I think it is important to point out that

4
5

in (a)(1) and (a)(2) Congress was not crafting pieces

6

of a puzzle that fit together neatly.

7

was attempting to cover the field as it was in many

8

of the provisions of the RICO statute.

9

a considerable overlap in these provisions.

I think Congress

So, there is
I don't

10

think anyone, although they have tried mightly, has

succeeded in construing the two provisions in such a

way that they interlock with no overlap.

13

is a considerable amount of overlap.
QUESTION:

14

I think there

But, are you satisfied that in

15

your view (a)(1) covers some things that (a)(2) doesn't

17

Certainly (a)(2) covers — Yes,

Justice Rehnquist, that is certainly true.

I still am not clear on what else you

MR. ALITO:

Well, under our interpretation,

(a)(1) covers any interest whether or not in an enter­

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

and I think that is what Congress clearly intended.
QUESTION:

3

Well — But,

(a)(1) would pick

up that, wouldn't it?
MR. ALITO:

(a)(1), as I have said, covers

any interest as that term has been defined in common

6

use.

QUESTION:

MR. ALITO:

MR. ALITO:

11

I don't think that is true unless

12

you mean — unless you read into the word "maintained,"

13

everything that is included in (a)(2) and I don't think

14

it is clear that Congress intended that.
QUESTION:

15

I supposed maintained in (a)(1)

MR. ALITO:

20

I think that is right, Justice

Rehnquist:

One may have an interest in a lawful enter­

22

prise and they use that enterprise to facilitate

racketeering activity.

24

25

the enterprise furthers the racketeering activity.

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

That results in a forfeiture under (a)(2) and would

2

not fall within the meaning of the word "maintained"

3

under (a)(1).

4

Petitioner suggested this morning that one

5

of the reasons that Congress held back from authorizing

6

the forfeiture of racketeering profits was because they

7

entertained some constitutional doubts about their

8

ability to do so.

9

see any constitutional problem and it is noteworthy that

He quickly concedes that he doesn't

10

this provision of a continuing criminal enterprise statute,

11

upon which he relied and which was enacted during the

12

same term of Congress, authorized the forfeiture of

13

illegal income derived from a continuing criminal enter­

14

prise engaged in drug activities.

15

In passing that statute, Congress had no

16

constitutional doubts, so it is farfetched, I would

17

suggest, to argue that Congress had unexpressed con­

18

stitutional doubts of very dubious validity about

19

authorizing the forfeiture of the RICO statute.

20

He argued that Congress may have held back

21

in authorizing the forfeiture of racketeering profits

22

because they thought that the civil remedies were enough,

23

but this is unconvincing for a number of reasons.

24
25

First, in many case, narcotics, gambling,
prostitution, there may be no identifiable victims to

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

come forward and bring civil suit and the result is

2

that the racketeer gets to keep his illegal gain even

3

though he has been convicted of participating in a

4

criminal offense.

5

The only argument he raised in his brief and

6

the only argument that was raised by the dissent below

7

for why Congress might not have wanted to authorize

8

the forfeiture of racketeering profits is that our

9

society, he says, is traditionally abhored in personam

10

11

forfeitures.
But, this argument is not good for at least

12

two reasons.

13

were in the past, there is little doubt that the Con­

14

gress that passed the RICO statute did not abhor in

15

personam forfeiture because it enacted an in personam

16

statute, both in RICO and in the continuing criminal

17

enterprise statute.

18

First of all, as I said, whatever attitudes

The RICO provision that is not challenged

19

here, 1963(a)(2), authorizes the forfeiture of interests

20

that may have been lawfully obtained and, therefore,

21

that is a far more extreme position than the forfeiture

22

of illegally obtained gains.

23

Congress wanted to do that.

It is not disputed that

24

The second reason why this argument is not

25

convincing is that it simply is not true in personam

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

have been historically disfavored.

What was outlawed by

2

the Constitution and by the first Congress was a parti­

3

cular harsh type of in personam forfeiture, what was

4

known in common law as forfeiture by attainder under

5

which the convicted felon was pronounced legally dead

6

and he lost all of his property and he lost the right

7

to transmit property to his heirs.

8

Now, just because that was felt to be too

9

harsh, it certainly doesn't follow that the same is

10

true of all in personam forfeiture.
On the contrary, in personam forfeiture is

11
12

really less harsh than in rem forfeiture because it

13

is a criminal proceeding.

14

the reasonable doubt standard.

15

QUESTION:

The government must satisfy
In rem forfeiture —

Well, do you have some dicta in,

16

for instance, the contract law of remedies that equity

17

abhors a forfeiture.

18

They will try to avoid reading it as a condition that

19

will result in a forfeiture, say, by failure to complete

20

a building?

21

MR. ALITO:

They will read something as —

Well, I think that is right, Justice

22

Rehnquist.

But, I understand petitioner to be drawing

23

a much mor subtle distinction between in personam and

24

in rem forfeitures.

25

our society has traditionally view in personam forfeitures

And, I think the argument that

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

as harsher and, therefore, has disfavored them as simply

2

not valid.
QUESTION:

3

Is there a bright distinction

4

between what you refer to as in rem forfeitures and

5

in personam forfeitures?
MR. ALITO:

6

There may not be a bright line,

7

but taking the extreme cases, there certainly is a

8

distinction.

9

feited object itself and it doesn't require proof of

In rem is a proceeding against the for­

10

the owner's fault.

11

in some cases of lawfully obtained property that was

12

used on a particular occasion for an illegal purpose,

13

even without the owner's knowledge or consent, a boat

14

that was used to import drugs or smuggle goods.
QUESTION:

15

It may result in the forfeiture

But, if I own a boat and it is

16

forfeited in an in rem proceeding and admiralty, I am

17

still without the boat at the end of the proceeding,

18

you know, even if you call it in rem.
MR. -ALITO:

19

That is exactly my point.

I think

20

it is at least as harsh, in many ways much harsher,

21

than the in personam forfeiture that is involved here

22

and simply results in a personal judgment against the

23

defendant.

24
25

My point is that is not to venture into the
area of policy whether it is socially desirable to

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

forfeit racketeering profits.

2

has been able to suggest why Congress might not have

3

wanted to do this and with that in mind I would like

4

to turn to the language in the legislative history of

5

RICO, both of which demonstrate that Congress did quite

6

clearly intend to authorize forfeiture of interest such

7

as those involved in this case.

8
9

My point is that no one

Now, of course, the starting point, as
petitioner observed, is the language of 1963(a)(1) itself

10

which calls for the forfeiture of any interest in an

11

enterprise.

12

maintained in violation of 1962, not an interest in

13

enterprise, any interest.

14

racketeering fall squarely within the plain meaning

15

of this statute.

16

Excuse me, of any interest acquired or

And, profits obtained from

Petitioner contests this on the grounds that

17

an interest means an interest in something.

18

usage is only employed to draw distinction between the

19

interest which is a bundle of rights, and the thing

20

to which the interest applies, so that racketeering

21

profits are clearly an interest in something.

22

are in interest in cash, in a bank account, in CD's

23

or the like.

24
25

But, that

They

If the language of 1963(a)(1) is not clear
enough, then the contrast with 1963(a)(2) is really

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

dispositive.

2

1963(a)(2) talks about an interest in an enterprise.

3

1963(a)(1) talks about any interest.

When Congress places a limitation like that

4

in one subsection and omits it from another, the in-

5

ference is virtually inescapable that they did so for

6

a purpose.

7

explanation to suggest, as petitioner did here, that

8

Congress simply wanted to say "inc." and did not want

9

to have to include the modifying terms, in an enter-

10

And, I don't think it is a convincing

prise, in 1963(a)(1).

11

Our interpretation is also supported by the

12

RICO statute's definition of the term "enterprise,"

13

which is not limited to legal entities, but also extends

14

to wholly illegitimate ones as this Court held in

15

Turkette.

16

Since Congress wanted to attack these enterprises,

17

it would not make sense for it to limit its forfeiture

18

provision in such as way as to make it ineffectual in

19

doing so.

20

there were usually no interest in the enterprise that

21

can be forfeited.

22

So, it would not have made sense for Congress to provide

23

solely for the forfeiture of interest in an enterprise

24

and not income which is the source of organized crime's

25

power.

Yet, in a case of an illegitimate enterprise,

They usually don't issue stock.

1

Petitioner relies on the use of the term

2

"income" in 1962(a), one of the prohibitory provisions,

3

and states that if Congress intended to require the

4

forfeiture of income in 1963(a)(1), it would have used

5

the term "income" there.

6

Well, I hardly think there is a dispute about

7

whether the term "income" was in Congress' vocabulary.

8

It knew the term, but it had a good reason for using

9

a different term in 1963(a)(1), because while that pro­

10

visions reaches income, it is not limited to income.

11

It includes many other types of real and personal

12

property and other things that afford sources of wealth

13

and control.

14

The alternative to using the broad less specific

15

term "interest" in 1963(a)(1) would have been an enumeration

16

of all the things subject to forfeiture.

17

QUESTION:

Your contention then really is

18

that interest in the term (a)(1) means any real or per­

19

sonal property-, tangible or intangible?

20
21

MR. ALITO:

That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.

The issue here, of course, is just the proceeds, but

22 we would contend that it reaches any type of real or
23

personal property.

24

And, as petitioner himself suggested, the

25

lower courts have held that it reaches other things

35
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

such as offices and companies and labor unions and

2

positions that permit a racketeer to control a business

3

or another organization.

4

QUESTION:

Now, what specifically is the

5

property that is being forfeited by the District Court

6

order here?

7

MR. ALITO:

The proceeds that petitioner re­

8

ceived from insurance companies when he submitted a

9

fraudulent claim on the property that he himself arranged

10

to have burned down.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ALITO:

13

In a somewhat related argument, petitioner

14

relies on the contemporaneously enacted provision of

15

continuing criminal enterprise statue which, as I said,

16

authorizes the forfeiture of illegal income derived

17

from the kinds of enterprises with which that statute

18

is concerned.

19

Cash?
It is cash, $140,000.

But,-although it is true that these two pro­

20 visions were contemporaneously enacted, they are really
21

the handiwork of different congressional committees,

22 and, thus, it is not clear their language was placed
23
24
25

under a microscope and compared.
Moreover, the language is fully consistent.
In the C.C.E. statute, Congress was concerned with a

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

single, narrow type of enterprise, an enterprise that

2

is engaged in drug activities.

3

usually generate large cash profits and there usually

4

is not an interest in the enterprise that can be for-

5

feited.

So, Congress used the narrow term "income."

0

In RICO, Congress was concerned with a dif-

7

ferent problem with a vast variety of enterprises and

8

with more than 30 specific kinds of enumerated criminal

9

conduct.

10

So, it used the broader term "interest."
Moreover, if it is true, as petitioner suggests,

11

that Congress carefully compared these two provisions,

12

that supports our argument and not his.

13

As I said, no one has suggested any reason

14

why Congress might not have wanted to authorize the

15

forfeiture of racketeering profits.

16

explanation is mere oversight.

17

C.C.E. provision to the availability of this potent

18

weapon, it doesn't make sense to suggest that Congress

19

would have omitted it from the RICO statute without

20

at least some discussion or debate if that is what

21

petitioner's position must be.

22

These enterprises

QUESTION:

The only possible

And, alerted by the

But, the other side of the coin,

23

if I might interrupt, is I gather they included or they

24

added Subsection (1) without any particular explanation

25

or debate focusing on that subjection, isn't that true?

1

That is one of our problems, in fact.
MR. ALITO:

2

That is certainly true, Justice

3

Stevens, but where Congress does something that is

4

fully consistent with its intent, I think that is less

5

in need of an explanation than when Congress is charged

6

with doing something that runs directly counter to its

7

broad intent and that is what petitioner —
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, except for the fact — This

is a very tricky case.

I must confess to be very puzzled

10

by it.

But, except for the fact, as Justice Rehnquist

11

has suggested, if you are talking about any property

12

of any kind in the way of profits, it would seem to

13

me that Congress would have been more apt to use the

14

kind of language it used in Section 848.

for this, namely, the difference between passive and

feitable under (a)(2).

Whereas this

MR. ALITO:

That is correct, Justice Stevens.

QUESTION:

So there is some sensible explana­

25

tion for his reading that does not make the two just

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

redundant really.
MR. ALITO:

2

Well, we don't argue that his

3

reading renders them completely redundant.

4

it is clear that our reading doesn't render them com­

5

pletely redundant.
As I said, these things were intended to occupy

6
7

the field and not really to interlock.
QUESTION:

8
9

I think

The problem with his reading is

you have got to stick some extra words in the statute.
MR. ALITO:

10

That is one of the problems with

11

his reading and another major problem with his reading,

12

beyond the plain language of RICO, is the legislative

13

history.

14

There are three points I would make about

15

the legislative history very quickly.

First, there

16

are numerous places in the legislative history where

17

sponsors and principal advocates of RICO, not just any

18

congressman, but the congressmen who were responsible

19

for drafting this bill and getting it enacted, stated

20 that one of the purposes of the forfeiture provision
21

was to take away racketeers'" illegal gain.

22

In the Senate, Senator McClellan, who was

23

probably the chief sponsor of the bill, stated that

24

RICO "would forfeit the ill-gotten gain of criminals

25

where the enter or operate an organization through a

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1
2

pattern of racketeering activity.”
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Alito, do you think you

3 could take a senator's statement on the floor that we
4 want ill-gotten gains forfeited and say he must have
5 meant profits as opposed to other kinds of interests?
6

MR. ALITO:

7 gains means.

I think that is what ill-gotten

It means illegal profit.

It certainly

8 doesn't mean — That certainly is a much more reasonable

9 reading than to say that it means a lawfully acquired
10 interest in an enterprise that has been used to further
11 a criminal purpose.
12

QUESTION:

But, my query was whether Senator

13 McClellan was really focusing on the fine distinctions
14 that perhaps the statute might have drawn when he said
15 ill-gotten gain.
16

MR. ALITO:

Well, it is less specific than

17 we might have hoped, but I think it is a reasonable
18 approximation of our argument.
19 isolated statement.

And, this is not a single,

There are many statements in the

20 debate to that effect and they illicited no opposition
21 or inquiries from other members of Congress suggesting
22 that maybe they shouldn't go that far.
23

Representative Poth, to give just one more

24 example, who was perhaps the statute's chief advocate
25 in the House, said after conviction the ill-gotten gains

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1 must be forfeited to the government.

And, the House

2 Report stated that the forfeiture provision extends
3 "to all property and interests as broadly defined which
4 are related to the violation."

And, as I said, there

5 are other statements to this effect.
6

The second point is, as I have pointed out,

7 that forfeiting racketeering profits is entirely con8 sistent with Congress' broad intent.

And, there are

9 many specific problems that Congress was concerned with
10 during the congressional debates that virtually cry
11 out for the forfeiture of racketeering profits.
12

One example are illegal businesses that

13 organized crime has dominated like narcotics and gambling
14 where there are no interests in the enterprise that
15 can be taken in forfeiture, but striking at the illegal
16 profits really gets at the heart of the matter.
17

And, another was the practice of taking over

18a legitimate business, skimming off profits and leaving
19 it bankrupt.

Forfeiting and interest in the bankrupt

20 shell would not do any good, but taking the illegal
21 profits that are drained off the business would be an
22 effective remedy.
23

The third point that emerges from the legis-

24 lative history is it is certainly true, as petitioner
25 points out, that there are statements in the legislative

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

history that the forfeiture provision results in the

2

forfeiture of interests in an enterprise.

3

of the statements, addressed to the finally enacted

4

version of RICO, states that the forfeiture provision

5

is limited to these interests.

6

illustrative and not exhaustive.

7

But, none

These are merely

And, as to the letter from Deputy Attorney

8

General Kleindeinst upon which petitioner relies, this

9

addressed an earlier version of the RIOC statute that

10

was limited to interest in an enterprise, so it really

11

sheds no light on what the finally enacted and amended

12

version means.

13

This letter was quoted and cited in the Senate

14

Report because of its bearing on the question of the

15

constitutionality of the forfeiture of interest in an

16

enterprise.

17

making was there isn't a constitutional problem when

18

the forfeited interest is one in an enterprise that

19

was involved in the violation and not simply an enter­

20

prise that the convicted person happened to have.

21

And, the point that Mr. Kleindeinst was

‘In conclusion, the forfeiture of racketeering

22

profits is an extremely important weapon in the on-going

23

battle against organized crime.

24

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD A. DION, ESQ. — Rebuttal

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

8

Do you have anything

MR. DION:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

9

I would like to respond to two things in

10

particular that possibly were not discussed in the

11

affirmative argument.

12

One question is what exactly is the difference

13

and the purpose of in personam jurisdiction versus in

14

rem forfeiture jurisdiction?

15

The reason that they went over to in personam

16

jurisdiction is twofold.

17

jurisdiction, it allows for the immediate and mandatory

18

forfeiture, totally non-discretionary.

19

have independent lawsuits, independent parties involved.

20

Number one, unlike in rem

In rem, you

More importantly, the reason that it was in

21

personam is so that the 1963 forfeiture could serve

22

its purpose and go to things that were normally not

23

forfeitable, that are not in rem.

24
25

I think the case of United States versus Rubin
is the perfect example of this.

The government wanted

the racketeer out the union, out of the enterprise.

To do this, the 5th Circuit said, all right, it is

subject — the office is subject to forfeiture.

is not in rem.

reason for the in personam jurisdiction.

6

It has to be in personam.

That is the

It is all well and good for the government

7

to say that we think profits should be forfeitable.

8

We believe that it is an effective weapon.

9

not what we are here to discuss.

That is

What we are here to

10

discuss is whether it does or does not fall under the

11

statute as written.

12

For example, the government has gone down

13

and listed a number of things that they believe are

14

subject to forfeiture under RICO which only has as its

15

fruits, if you will —

16

QUESTION:

Of course, if the language was

17

all that clear, probably this case wouldn't be here.

18

I thought you said earlier in your argument, your

19

argument in chief, the statute is a little confusing —

20

MR. DION:

It is.

21

QUESTION:

— and hard to parse.

So you must

22

turn to secondary sources like the government does,

23

is that right?

MR. DION:

The secondary sources certainly

MR. DION:

level.

is almost in the third position.

One of the things that is interesting is the

18

government talks about the history of the last 15 years,

19

how now, because forfeitures are so run-of-the-mill,

20

we can interpret them as broadly as we possibly want.

21

However, hone of those were on the books in 1970 when

22

the issue of the intent of Congress actually came into

23

being, the kind of after-the-fact.

24
25

I think one of the important things though
is what really was the purpose of the racketeering

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

statute?

2

think there is really any argument on this — is to

3

get the racketeer out of the enterprise, to allow the

4

enterprise to live independent of the racketeering

5

and to survive.

6

The purpose of the statute — and I don't

Very simply stated, unless the profits and

7

proceeds are put back into an enterprise, it falls out­

8

side the scope of the statute.

9

we have 1962(a).

That is one of the reasons

That is what provides for the sub­

10

stantive crime and ultimately the forfeiture when there

11

is a plowing back into an enterprise of illegally

12

obtained interest and proceeds.

13

proceeds are not put back into the enterprise —

14

though it may very well be that Congress would love

15

to get those profits and proceeds — it goes outside

16

the purpose and scope of the racketeering statute.

17

QUESTION:

If the interest and

Well, Mr. Dion, you do concede

18

that Congress, in its stated purpose, intended to

19

eradicate organized crime, do you not?

20
21

22

MR. DION:

There is no question that was their

stated purpose.
However, at the same time, we take a look

23

at what are the underlying crimes.

The government

24

basically says we have got to go after profits and

25

proceeds as a forfeiture of all the underlying crimes.

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

If we look at the list of underlying crimes, Congress

2

has not provided for forfeiture of the underlying

3

substantive crimes in many cases.

4

tution and murder, for example, have no forfeiture

5

provisions attached to them.

6

Gambling, prosti­

That is one of the reasons I would suggest

7

that the scope and purpose of RICO is getting the

8

criminal out of the enterprise and that under that

9

interpretation the statute can be read as expressly

10

worded without a provision for the forfeiture of income,

11

profits, and proceeds.
