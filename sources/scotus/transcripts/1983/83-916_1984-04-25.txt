ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. MC CONNELL, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. MC CONNELL;

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
The issue in this case is whether the United

11

States in its capacity as employer and garnishee is

12

required to reimburse an employee for sums deducted from

13

his paycheck in compliance with the facially valid state

14

court writ of garnishment enforcing a judgment for

15

alimony and child support.

16

The state court subsequently was found net to

17

have had personal jurisdiction over the employee

18

respondent here in the underlying divorce proceeding.

19

The legal framework under which this case

20

arises is a federal garnishment statute, 42 USC 659,

21

which waives federal sovereign immunity and subjects

22

federal agencies to suit in the capacity as garnishee to

23

enforce alimony and child support in like manner and to

24

the same extent as any private garnishee and which

25

expressly immunizes the United States from liability for

3

1

honoring any legal process regular on its face.
The facts of this case are quite simple when

2
3

viewed from the perspective of a federal disbursing

4

officer whose only responsibility is tc ensure that the

5

garnishment writ is regular on its face.

1975, the Air

Force Finance Office at Elmundorf Air Base in Alaska was

QUESTION:

You left out that he was served on

the case itself from Alabama by mail.
MR. MC CCNNEILj

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

The Air Force Finance Office received two documents.

17

received a writ of garnishment and it received a copy of

18

the underlying judgment of divorce issued by the Alabama

19

state court.

20

21

processing it, examining the document to make sure that

22

it was one that qualified under the statute.

court of competent jurisdiction.

jurisdiction, and unquestionably is a court competent to

case,

11

being sought for that purpose.

Since

In this

the face of the writ revealed that the sums were

Third, he checked to see if the writ was in

12
13

the proper form, and as the trial court found as a fact,

14

the writ of garnishment was in the proper form, the

15

usual form used by the state of Alabama for writs of

16

garnis hment.

17

And finally, the officer examined the writ to

18

see if there were any irregularities on the face of the

19

writ which would suggest invalidity under state or

20

federal law.
Now, I mentioned that there were two documents

21
22

served on the Air Force.

The ether document was a copy

23

of the judgment of divorce.

24

document was net necessary for the processing of the

25

writ.

Now, in this instance that

Under the regulations of the Office of Personnel

5

Management which implement this statute, it is necessary

2

to file a copy of the underlying decree only when the

3

writ itself does not make plain whether it was for child

which is net uncommon, since

In this case, as I have

the writ itself indicated that it was for child
Thus the second document was not

Nonetheless, it is worth noting that a copy of

10
11

the judgment of divorce was also regular on its face.

12

There are no irregularities apparent on the face of the

13

document that would suggest invalidity, and in the first

14

line of the judgment of divorce, it states that

15

respondent was duly served and failed

16

divorce proceeding.

to appear in the

Upon receiving the writ, the finance office

17
18

promptly notified Colonel Morton, who then sought legal

19

advice.

20

protested the garnishment to the finance office on

21

several grounds.

22

Open the advice of counsel, Colonel Norton

First, he claimed

that he had in fact been

23

satisfying on a regular monthly basis his obligations

24

for divorce and alimony.

25

neither domiciled in nor a resident of Alabama.

Second, he claimed that be was

6

And

1

third,

he claimed that he had not been properly served

2

in the divorce proceeding.
Since none of these matters went to the

3
4

question of the reaularity of the writ on its face, the

5

disbursing officer answered the writ and subsequently

6

deducted the sums owing to Mrs. Morton and paid them

7

over tc the registry of the Alabama court.
Colonel Morton did not then nor has he at any

8
9

time since challenged the state court judgment in the

10

Alabama courts.

11

notice which was provided him by the Air Force expressly

12

informed him that he might have defenses to the

13

This is in spite of the fact that the

underlying action, advised him to seek legal counsel,

14

and informed him that the United States would not be

15

asserting his defenses for him in the garnishment

16

action .

17

In fact, Colonel Merton did seek advice cf

18

counsel from not one but two attorneys, and on their

19

advice he chose not to challenge the underlying action.

20

The position of the government on these facts

21

is straightforward.

The garnishment writ was regular on

22

its face.

23

paid his obligations, whether the court's recital that

24

he had

25

had sufficient contacts with Alabama tc justify

Colonel Morton's arguments, whether he had

been duly served was accurate, and whether he had

7

1

jurisdiction were beyond the ken of disbursing officers

2

and beyond their powers and responsibilities under the

3

statute and implementing regulations.
The Air Force was required in like manner and

4
5

to the same extent, no more, no less than any private

6

garnishee to comply with the state court legal process.
Now, the facts and legal principles applicable

7
8

to this case when viewed from respondent's position,

9

that is, locking to see whether there was in fact

10

personal jurisdiction over Colonel Morten in that

11

underlying divorce proceeding, are considerably more

12

complicated, and I will leave those facts for opposing

13

counsel to develop.
Suffice it tc say that the courts below found

14
15

it necessary to determine and to rely upon the following

16

facts among others.

17

voted.

18

They looked at where he registered his automobile, why

19

he used his moving allowance tc send his family to

20

Alabama, what his subjective intentions were when he

21

moved

They looked at where Colonel Morton

They locked at where he paid taxes and why.

to Alaska, and the like.

22

Just a recital of some of these facts should

23

indicate that these are not the facts which are within

24

the ordinary purview of the disbursing officer paying

25

out federal salaries, but even after the facts had been

8

1

established by the trial court below, the able judges of

2

the federal circuit were not able tc agree on the legal

3

conclusions to be given those facts.
They in fact split on a two tc one vote cn the

4
5

question of whether the Alabama divorce court did have

6

jurisdiction over Colonel Merton, but cf course the

7

majority on the panel did conclude that the Alabama

8

court had erred on the question of its own jurisdiction,

9

and that the Air Force should have refused to honor the

10

Alabama writ.
This case is thus a perfect illustration cf

11
12

why Congress limited the responsibility of the federal

13

disbursing agents to determining whether the writ is

14

regula r cn its face, and why it makes neither practical

15

nor legal sense to put the federal government at the

16

risk of double payment when the disbursing officer

17

honors a state court order at risk on facts that the

18

officer has no means of knowing, and on legal

19

determinations that the officer has no authority or

20

capacity to make.
It puts the federal government at risk that a

21
22

federal court may subsequently decide that a facially

23

valid state court order which the employee himself had

24

chosen net tc challenge at the time had been erroneously

25

entered.

The practical effect on the federal government

Q

1

is plain.

Respondent's theory subjects the government

2

unfairly to double liability even where it has performed

3

all of the actions that the law requires, but the

4

practical effect on the Congressional scheme in the

5

garnishment statute is equally important.
Congress passed the garnishment statute in

6
7

1974 for the express purpose of providing a rapid and

8

convenient means whereby former spouses and children

9

could obtain enforcement of child support and alimony

10

judgments.

It was based expressly on the findings by

11

Congress that then existing remedies were inadequate.

12

In fact, after hearings and considerable investigation,

13

Congress concluded that the failure of

14

provide adequate enforcement of child support and

15

alimony orders were a major contributing cause to

16

poverty and to the welfare problem, finding that there

17

were large numbers cf affluent and middle class fathers

18

who simply abandoned their families and did not comply

19

with the orders, leaving their families dependent upon

20

public assistance.

the system to

The legislative history shows that Congress

21
22

intended for garnishment writs to be honored on the

23

basis of the state court order or decision alone.

24

did not impose any ether conditions precedent to the

25

payment.

But under the holding of the court below,

10

2

itself from double liability.

unintended obstacle to the Congressional purposes.

16

spouses and children to whom Congress intended that they

17

be present,

18

19

and it would relegate them to the very

Now, I realize that the court below, echoed by

20

respondent in his brief in this Court, are considerably

21

more upbeat about those remedies that Congress had

22

considered and found inadequate.

23

I don't propose to go into that particular

24

debate , because for purposes cf interpreting what

25

Congress intended for this statute, it matters only that

? 11

1

Congress drew the conclusion that those remedies were

2

inadequate, and it is manifestly contrary to the

3

Congressional purposes to enable a federal disbursing

4

officer because of his unilateral doubts about a state

5

court process to deny those benefits to the spouses and

6

children Congress intended to assist.
But all of this is even assuming that the

7

8

United

States, having agreed to be subject in like

9

manner and to the same extent as any private garnishee

10

to garnishment writs would be free to disregard a

11

facially valid and binding state court crder, a matter

12

which we consider highly dubious on its face.

13

The more likely alternative here is that the

14

government’s explanation for refusing to honor a writ

15

would be treated as an answer or return under state law,

16

but this would then put the government in the position

17

of litigating against the spouse and children who were

18

the intended beneficiaries of the statute.

19

be litigating against the spouse and children in state

20

court on behalf of the employee concerning the validity

21

of the underlying divorce.

22

They would

I can imagine few roles which are less

23

appropriate for the United States government than for it

24

to be litigating on one side in state court of a marital

25

dispute, and it would turn the purpose of the

12

1

garnis hment statute on its head.

Congress intended to

2

make i t easier for spouses and children to collect their

3

alimon y and child support r ights, and instead, under the

4

judgme nt of the court below , the government would be

5

enlist ed as their opponent in collecting those

6

benef i ts.
The final alterna tive which in my view is the

7

8

most 1 ikely in the long run if the judg ment belo w we re

9

affirm ed is that the United S ta te s would be fore ed t c

10

file i nterpleader actions i n federal co urt to re solv e

11

who wo uld be entitled to re ceive th e em ploy ee' s sala ry.

12

This w ould indeed get the U nited States off the hook for

13

double liability, but there is very lit tie else in t he

14

pr oced ure that commends it.
First of all, the spouse and children would be

15

to litigate their ri ghts a second time in a mere

16

f orced

17

expens ive forum.

18

Secondly, it woul d net even benefit the

19

employ ee, the working spous e, since he would be required

20

to lit igate as well, most 1 ikely in the very state where

21

the sp cuse and children are living, which was the very

22

thing which he is trying to avoid through all of this,

23

and th e federal courts wcul d be inundated with numerous

24

new in terpleader actions, i n each one of which the

25

questi on would be whether a state court divorce decree

13

1

2

had been properly entered.
Neither the purpose of the statute nor any

3

ether sensible public policy would be promoted by this

4

course of events.

5

But the results are not required, we submit,

6

by the statute under the plain language of the statute.

7

Section 659(a) subjects the United States to exactly the

8

same obligations as are imposed on private garnishees,

9

yet private garnishees are not required to second guess

10

state court judgments cr to litigate on behalf of the

11

principal debtors.

12

It is well established under the law of

13

virtually every jurisdiction that the duty of a

14

garnishee to his creditor is simply to give notice of

15

the action, no more.

16

immunizes the government from liability for honoring a

17

legal process that is regular on its face.

18

plain enough.

21

To reach its contrary conclusion, the court of

22

appeals took a rather roundabout route of

23

interpretation, holding that because the term "legal

24

process” is defined in the statute to be, among other

25

things , process which is issued by a court of competent

14

1

jurisdiction, and then holding that the tern "competent

garnishee, the United State s, as the defendant, and

7

there is no question that t he Tenth Judicial Circuit

8

Court of Alabama was a cour t of competent jurisdiction

9

to issue this garnishment w rit.

Whether or not the

10

Alabama court properly had jurisdiction to issue a

11

divorce is simply beside th e point.

12

The third flaw in the Court of Appeals *

13

a n a ly s is is th| t it as sumes a definition of competent

14

jurisd iction that is q uite unnecessary and is

15

incons istent with the conte xt in which it is used,

It

21

Nc w, in erde r to tell whether it has that

22

definition or the more expa nsive definiotion, it is

23

necessary to lock at the te rm in context, and since in

24

context it is apparent that it should be a matter which

25

is discernible on the face of the writ, it is plain that

16

1

the Court of appeals drew a conclusion which was

2

unnecessary and in fact inconsistent with seme of the

J

other terms in the statute.
New, the Court of Appeals apparently reached

4
5

the tortured conclusion out of a fear that a contrary

6

construction of the garnishment statute would violate

7

Colonel Norton's due process rights.

8

there are no due process problems that would demand a

9

non-literal interpretation of this statute.

We submit that

Colonel Norton's due process rights may well

1
11

have been violated by the Alabama divorce judgment,

12

assuming that the Alabama courts in fact lacked personal

13

jurisdiction over him, but that, of course, is true

14

whenever a court erroneously exercises jurisdicticr ever

15
16

a person.
Colonel Norton received notice of the divorce

17

proceeding and made a deliberate tactical judgment net

2

Alabama court.

22

do so in the course of defending the garnishment order.

And indeed because he is a serviceman, Colonel Norton

25

He could have made

He could have done so even after the

He also has the ability to sue plaintiff, who

17

illegally or unconstitutionally taken from him.

18

nothing in the due process clause entitles Colonel

19

Morton to shift the losses cf his legal tactics onto his

20

employ er.

21

But

The United States is simply a stakeholder in

22

this dispute.

legally binding state court process, as we are required

to do under statute.

plain language of the garnishment statute, because it

US. CARBCLLs

All right, sir.

2

This is a military pay case.

Thank you.
It involves the

3

interpretation of a federal statute and how it is

4

supposed to be administered by the military services.

5

This case does not in any way affect the Alabama court

6

order.

7

It does not say anything to Alabama and to the order.

It does not modify.

It does not hold it void.

All it says tc it is, you may not enforce it

8
9

in this manner simply because it does not qualify under

10

the definitions set forth in the federal statute, which

11

is 42

12

for the sole reason of clarifying this statute, as

13

Senator Nunn made it clear when he argued for this

14

amendment on the floor of the Senate.

USC 659 and 662, because that was amended in 1S77

15

Since that is true, we have to look -- this is

16

not a man that is trying to escape liability as you have

17

heard about so many times, and you have heard them talk

18

about the reason for this statute.

19

of going in there and amending for nothing whatsoever.

8

If their position is true, why in the world would they

Congress is never presumed to do a useless
Act, and that is what they are saying.
The thing here is that it does say in the

major portion of this 659 section of that statute that

16

they must be treated like any other private person.

17

Well, in Alabama, there is a case that was cited by the

18

dissent which is the case of Harris versus National

19

Bank, a 1981 case long after these Alabama statutes came

20

into being which said once the amount is paid it

21

discharges the garnishee, and in that case they cited

22

the old 1876 case of Pounds versus Hammer, which says

23

that any garnishee paying on a void judgment is liable.

24
25

Now, in the case that -- this Harris versus
National Bank case, the court there said, I am going to
