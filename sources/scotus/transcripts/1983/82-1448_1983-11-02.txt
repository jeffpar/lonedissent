CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF CF PETITIONER
MR. CLAIBORNE:

6

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
The question on the merits in this case is

8
9

I think

you may proceed when you're ready.

5

7

He. Claiborne,

whether, in carrying periodic inspections of stationary

10

emissions sources under the Clean Air Act, EPA may avail

11

itself of the help of retained independent contractors

12

under a provision of the Clean Air Act that permits the

13

use of authorized representatives of the Administrator

14

for this purpose.
But before reaching that question on the

15
18

merits, there is a threshold question, which is whether

17

EPA was barred in this particular suit from asserting

18

the affirmative of the question on the merits because in

19

an earlier suit arising out of an attempted inspection

20

of another plant belonging to the same company, but

21

located in a different state and a different judicial

22

district, another Court of Appeals had rejected that

23

position.

24
25

This case, which is referred to in the papers
as Stauffer II, arises out of an attempted inspection of

Respondent's phosphorus plant in Tennessee some time in

2

March of 1980.

3

officials and also by retained independent contractors,

4

experts in the field, sought entry to that plant.

5

company refused entry to the independent contractors.

The

An impasse was reached, and some weeks later,

8

in August, EPA secured a warrant to enter the plant.

9

That warrant specifically authorized that they, EPA

10

personnel, be accompanied by the independent

11

contractors.

12

entry to the contractors.

Nevertheless, the company again refused

13

EPA then moved to hold the company in contempt

14

for disobedience of the warrant, and in turn the company

15

moved to have the warrant quashed.

16

Now, by this time Stauffer, Respondent here,

17

had won this same issue in a district court in Wyoming,

18

in the Tenth Circuit.

19

the papers as Stauffer I.

20

This decision is referred to in

Interestingly, in this case, the case before

21

the Court today, when it was in the district court it

22

was not argued, and indeed it seems to be common ground

23

that it could not have been argued, that Stauffer I was

24

any bar to reaching the merits in the present case.

25

That is because not only was that district court

1

decision in Stauffer I not final — indeed, it was

2

appealed — but also because the holding on the issue

3

that concerns us here was merely an alternative holding,

4

and in those circumstances estoppel would not apply.
Accordingly, the district court in our case

5

6

considered the matter on the merits.

But it considered

7

it for several months, only issuing its opinion in April

8

198 1.

9

•

In the meanwhile, two other district courts

10

elsewhere had decided the same issue.

11

Fourth Circuit, what is called the Alcoa case; another

12

was in the Ninth Circuit, the Bunker Hill case.

13

instances the decision had gone in favor of EPA,

14

allowing the use of these independent contractors to

15

perform or to aid in the performing of these

16

inspections.

18

— the district court in our case, noting the conflict

19

among these other district court decisions, Stauffer I

20

in favor of the company, Alcoa and Bunker Hill in favor

21

of EPA, determined to consider the matter afresh.

22

its words, it was writing on a clean slate in this

23

circuit, the Sixth Circuit.

24
25

In

In what can only he fairly described as a
carefully reasoned opinion,

the district court rejected

1

the company's arguments and held that the statute does

2

indeed permit EPA to use independent contractors to aid

3

it in these inspections.
The Respondent obtained a stay and filed an

4
5

appeal to the Sixth Circuit.

While that appeal was

6

pending — and it was pending for some time,

7

— there were two further developments.

8

cases I've mentioned, Stauffer I and Bunker Hill, were

9

decided by their respective Courts of Appeals.

1^ months

Two of the

Stauffer

10

I was decided by the Tenth Circuit in favor of the

11

company, whereas Bunker Hill was decided by the Ninth

12

Circuit in favor of EPA.
The Government did not seek certiorari from

13
14

Stauffer I, that being the first appellate decision, and

15

obviously there was then no inter-circuit conflict, and

16

in turn when, six months later. Bunker Hill was decided

17

by the Ninth Circuit the other way, that company did not

18

seek certiorari to this Court.
It was against this background

19

that the case

20

was decided by the Sixth Circuit in the matter before

21

the Court today.

22

collaterally estopped by Stauffer I from relitigating

23

against the Stauffer company the independent contractor

The court held, first, that EPA was

petition of certiorari on both questions.

The upshot is that the Government lost on

I take the estoppel question first.

10

of the argument just had, it would be needless of me to

11

repeat the general principles which Mr. Geller has fully

12

and adequately outlined.

13

we're dealing with a pure question of law.

14

dealing with a question of public law.

15

with a question of public law that affects the welfare

16

of the general citizenry.

17

In light

I stress that here, as there,
We're

We're dealing

We're dealing with a question of public law in

18

which a broad category of competing operators are

19

controlled by the legislation.

20

public law that is administered on a continuing basis by

21

a governmental agency throughout the nation.

22

We're dealing with a

Now, in those circumstances, as Mr. Geller

23

says, it is common ground, and certainly common ground

24

between counsel for Stauffer and myself, that the rules

25

of estoppel must be applied in a more limited way than

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

would otherwise be true, I would say with special

2

caution; and all the reasons with respect to freezing a

3

possibly erroneous rule of law, burdening this Court and

4

the Courts of Appeals with unnecessary appeals, apply

5

fully here as they do in the previous case.

6

Indeed, here no one argues that EPA should be

7

barred from relitigating the same issue against another

8

company merely because it lost the first appellate court

9

test in Stauffer I.

Nor is it argued that the

10

Government is estopped because it failed to petition for

11

certiorari in Stauffer I.

12

this Court would more likely than not have denied that

13

petition, there being no conflict at the time, and the

14

denial of the writ would have made the decision no more,

15

no less final than the failure to petition in the first

16

place.

17

Presumably, had it petitioned

And indeed, the Ninth Circuit’s conflicting

18

decision in Bunker Hill, rendered after Stauffer I,

19

sufficiently illustrates the proposition that no one

20

suggests that the rule is frozen by the first appellate

21

decision in Stauffer I.

22

The only serious question presented in this

23

case in this respect differing from the previous case is

24

whether the original party, here Stauffer, ought to be

25

insulated nationwide because it won in the first test in

he who prevailed in that first litigation, we say that

4

the prevailing party ought to be secure for the time

an attempt to redetermine the distinct right or title or

7

status that was adjudicated in his favor, even though
that right, title or status depends entirely on an

right in the underlying rule of law.
He has a vested right in the resulting title

or entitlement or right or status which came to him

13

personally as a result of applying that rule of law, and

14

no challenge to that resulting title or right can

15

properly be brought until its normal period has

expired .
As I*ve suggested, in the tax law that is one

One cannot relitigate whether or not a taxpayer

19

is or is not owing certain taxes or is entirely exempt

20

within the given tax year.

21

In the context of the previous case, one could

22

never relitigate the question of whether the 68 veterans

23

are or are not entitled to citizenship.

24

becomes a vested right in the judgment.

25

That is —

But the underlying rule of law that led to

that result is fully open to relitigation# even as

against the same party if occasion should arise.

3

this is saying something more than merely giving res

4

judicata effect to the first judgment, because that

entitlement to citizenship# for instance# in the case of

the 68 veterans, works not only to prevent the

As this

issue was whether his service as a cadet at the Academy

19

counted as far as service towards the 40 years, and that

20

had been determined in his favor by the Court of Claims

21

in Moser I.

22

It apparently had been redetermined in his

23

favor in two subsequent cases, but in the interim there

24

had been a conflicting decision by the Court of Claims

25

in someone else*s case, and in the third of those cases

Here, therefore, we're left with two choices.

24

One is to say that Stauffer, the Stauffer company, has

25

won a permanent exemption from inspection by EPA's

3

from the enforcement of a particular warrant, addressed

4

to a particular inspection at a specific plant.

Faced with those choices —

Justice White, which is that —

15

QUESTION;

I think it was, but more recently

you’ve been talking about multiple plants.
HR. CLAIBORNE;

Yes.

I am driven to say that

16

after an appropriate lapse of time, even with respect to

17

the single plant, the Government cannot be estopped.

18

And here the appropriate length of time I would

19

analogize to the rule in tax law, which in that case is

20

the taxable year.

21

to avoid any claim of harrassment would seem to be the

22

time within which, probably a year, in which as a matter

23

of random selection of inspection sites this plant

24

should once again come on the roll.

Do you

Concededly, to hold in favor

18

of the Stauffer company here would not present the full

19

array of problems that would be involved in a comparable

20

decision in the previous case, because the Government

21

would remain free to relitigate this issue as against

22

other companies in other circuits and, as has been the

23

experience, and produce a conflict which ultimately

24

could reach this Court.

MR. LETTOW;

the Court didn't think it made so much sense that the

So essentially, in Montana the Court explained

test.

I think that really is the

And indeed, if EPA’s position were adopted

13
14

we'd be remitted to the separable facts doctrine that

15

I think that was what Mr.

11

acknowledge that the Restatement of Judgments notes that

14

the Government's special role is entitled to weight in

15

deciding whether or not to apply collateral estoppel in

16

the particular case.

17

We acknowledge that the

We

We question whether anybody has concluded that

18

the Government's role is dispositive, and it would have

19

to be dispositive to rule against us on collateral

estoppel in this particular case because this is the

21

most traditional application of collateral estoppel.

22

This is defensive collateral estoppel by the party tc

the prior case.

That is, mutuality is present.

Stauffer was subject to repetitive claims,
excessive claims by EPA, not the other way around.

And you also have, along the same line, an

expression of view in the American Medical case in the

1970.

14

As Hr. Claiborne pointed out, it was

At the time of its adoption, the House had

15

provided in its bill that officers and employees of the

16

Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which was

17

then charged with the responsibility for administering

language which now appears in the final text.

21

The Senate’s

In the Conference Committee report which

22

describes the conferees* effort to resolve the

23

differences, the cenferees describe the House provision

24

as authorizing DHEW investigatory personnel to enter and

25

make searches of plants.

It described also the Senate

1

provision# the "authorized representative" language, as

2

authorizing DKEH personnel to enter and search plants.

3

In other words, it used exactly the same language to

4

describe those persons who could implement the

5

authority.
Judge Weick in the Sixth Circuit, like the

6
7

Tenth Circuit had, viewed this declaration of

8

equivalence between the terms by the conferees as

9

indicating the Congressional intent not to ascribe any

\

10

particular difference in interpretation or construction

11

between the choice of the two terms.
And indeed, there is also other evidence which

12
13

indicates that the Senate did not have in mind any

14

broader reach in using the term "authorized

15

representative" than the House did when it used the term

16

"officers and employees".

17

the term "authorized representatives" and the House

18

generally had used the term "officers and employees"

19

throughout the bills that it had adopted inr 1970.

The Senate had used generally

There was, however, a section of the Senate

20
21

bill,

Section 209(a), at least it was then, which dealt

22

with EPA's access to the records of auto manufacturers,

23

and that section provided specifically that, upon

24

request of an authorized representative of the

25

Secretary, again of HEW at that point, the auto

this was direct evidence of what the Senate

3
4

had in mind.

It meant officers and employees when it

5

used the term "authorized representatives" in the

6

statute.
And indeed, this intent on the part of

7
8

Congress was confirmed very shortly thereafter.

After

9

the Congress had completed work on amendments to the

10

Clean Air Act in 1970, it then turned, or the same

11

committees turned, to the Clean Water Act, and they

12

proposed to add terms to the Clean Water Act which would

13

authorize the agency to inspect and search plants.

14

used when they did that as a model the provisions which

15

they had just adopted in the Clean Air Act.

16

the terms in the Water Act, that Section 308(a), are

17

almost identical with those which appear in Section

18

114 (a)(2).

The authority to enter

No, it’s not.

And indeed, the

12

Justice Elackmun.

That's quite correct,

But, as Judge Weick found in this case, you

13
14

have the situation where the Clean Water Act provision

15

was very specifically and expressly modeled after the

25

Section 114(d) says that where searches by EPA are being

2

its authorized representatives should give notice to the

3

affected state that these inspections are being carried

4

out.
As both the Tenth Circuit and the Sixth

5
6

Circuit found, it almost passes understanding that the

7

Congress would have had in mind in adopting that

8

provision that you’d have notice given, such a sensitive

9

intergovernmental communication, by a contractor and not

10

by the responsible Government official.
What EPA does is point to a different section ,

11
12

that’s Section 114(c), as support for its position.

13

that section doesn’t even relate to searches.

14

what it does is authorize disclosure of confidential

15

information to, in the words of that particular section,

16

"authorized representatives of the United States".
This is a broader reference.
