You mean if I have a tree in my

HR. ALPFRIN:

It is not public property, but

21

certainly having that tree adds to the vitality and to

22

the beauty of that community.

23

the City has a right to remove signs that you put up on

24

your own tree, and the City has net interpreted its

ordinance to permit it to dc that.

We are not arguing that

It would not reasonably but

Yes, we would have to concede

QUESTION*

10

Unless the City construed to the

11

contrary, but no California court has construed the

12

ordinance.

13

Is that right?
MR. ALPERIN i

To our knowledge this ordinance

14

has been construed in one unreported case -- not

15

construed by the constitutionality, has been tested in

16

one unreported case of a superior court appellate

17

department decision.

18

It is an unreported opinion, and in that case

19

that court ruled that the ordinance might be

20

unconstitutional, send it back down the municipal court

21

for an evidentiary hearing as to the facts which might

22

support a valid public purpose.

23

in the municipal court and did not appeal that.

24
25

The City lost a motion

But no, it has not actually been construed and
certainly to our knowledge has not been construed with

regard to the question of whether or not a private tree

2

on private property is subject to the ordinance.

not believe that that would be a reasonable

interpretation.

QUESTION;

We do

This suit was a facial attach on

the ordinace?
KS. ALPEBIN.

That is right.

This suit is

8

concerned with objects which are located on or adjacent

9

to the public streets.

The litigation did net deal

10

either at the district court level or the level of the

11

Ninth Circuit with questions of trees and shrubs that

12

might be located on someone's own private property and

3
4

so that question was just never litigated in this case.
QUESTION;

Well, I would expect it would be if

5

it is a facial attack.

6

KB. A L P E RI !i;

That is certainly correct, tut

7

what was litigated and whet all of the attention was

8

placed on was the question of whether or not these

9

objects including trees and shrubs which are located on

20

and along the streets are a public forum.

21

contends that they are not a public forum even though

22

they are located on and along the street.

They were erected either so that the City

12

could string its utility wires along the streets in a

13

convenient place or with regard to the lighting system

14

sc that the streets could be lit for safety purposes or

15

with regard to posts and poles that are erected for the

16

purpose of displaying the City's own traffic and street

17

information, information about where the City streets

are, what street someone may be driving on, how fast

So they were not designated by the government

QUESTION;

Tt

hr. Alperin, may I ask a Question

24

following up on Justice Brennan’s inquiry about signs on

25

private property?

I notice in the complaint they allege

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that they have been advised by the police officer I

2

guess whoever 's duty it was to enforce that they will

3

sometimes verify that the sign has been posted without

4

the consent of the owner, agent or occupant and then

S

make a physical arrest which implies — This, of course,

6

is in the complaint -- that sometimes the ordinance is

7

enforced against posting on private property.
NR. ALFERIK;

8
9

There is another City ordinance

which is another section of the Municipal Code, Section

10

28.03,

which prohibits the attachment of signs to

11

buildings and to any private property without the

12

consent of the owner.

13

QUESTION:

I see.

14

NR. ALPEBINs

In further answer to Nr.

15

Brennan's question and your question following up on

16

that with regard to the trees, certainly because of the

17

existence of that other section we could construe the

18

reference to trees in Section 28.04 to relate only to

19

trees on public property because we have another section

20

that relates to attachment of signs to private property

21

and that certainly would include trees on private

22

property which would be a reasonable interpretation cf

23

both ordinances together.

24
25

QUESTION i

hr. Alperin, if you look at. page 16

of tha Joint Appendix there you have I believe Exhibit. 8

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-8300

1

which you filed as one of your exhibits to your answer

2

in the district court, and as I read it it is a

3

statement which says the policy of the Los Angeles

4

Police Department in enforcing viclaticns and it

5

describes Section 28.03 prohibits the painting or

6

posting of any handbill or sign on private property

7

without the consent of the owner, agent or occupant.

8

Section 28.04 prohibits the painting or pcstina of any

9

handbill or sign on utility poles, street signs, curbs

10

or other public property.

11

MR. ALPEEIN:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

That is correct.

New was that summarizing the way

the ordinance is enforced?
MR. ALPERIN:

Yes, that is true with the only

15

exception that indeed some cf the utility poles although

16

used by the public are private property because they

17

belong to privately owned utilities.

18

general sense Section 28.03 relates to private property

19

and permits signs on private property assuming that the

20

owner of that property or someone in control of that

21

property Consents to the attachment of a sign on that

22

property in Section 28.04.

Mr. Canterbury.

MR. CANTERBURY*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
Section 28.04 as it is enforced by the los

13

Angeles Eolice Department constitutes an absolute ban on

14

all temporary signs on all public property.

ME. CANTERBURY;

The portion of the ordinance

that we challenged on appeal was only Section 28.C4.

22

abandoned a challenge to 28.03, and we believe that the

want — That is your submission as the way we should

MR. CANTERBURY;

5

Yes, as interpreted and as

enforced by the police department.

I think part of the

7

confusion stems from the police department's

8

interpretion of the section, and that is Exhibit P to

9

the complaint that was read

earlier that the police

department has its own idea in Los Angeles what this

ordinance means.
The police department believes that it

and so long as it is not saying to one candidate I will

4

let you put up your signs and to another candidate I

5

will not let you put up your sign, if it is not doing

6

that then the City ought to be entitlted to enforce, to

7

enact and keep and enforce this regulation especially

8

because those objects which the City prohibits signs on

9

are not a public forum.

10

This Court ought to reverse the decision of

11

the Ninth Circuit which found the ordinance

12

unconstitutional on its face and granted summary

13

judgment on the constitutional issue to the Plaintiffs.

14

For the reasons that we cited in our briefs and the

15

arguments today, the City submits that its ordinance is

16

unconstitutional and urges this Court to reverse the

17

decision of

the 'Ninth Circuit.

18

Thank you.

(Whereupon, at 2:00 p.m.,
