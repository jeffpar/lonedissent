Mr. Appel, I think

here, and sc the Court is fully familiar with the

10

underlying facts.

But this time it comes here in a very

11

different analytical posture.

12

recall, highly probative testimony about the fact that

13

the witness in the back seat of a car made incriminating

14

statements that ultimately led police to the body of a

15

murder victim was suppressed on the ground that the

16

Respondent’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was

17

violat ed.

In the first case,

as you

After this Court set aside the first

19

conviction. Respondent was retried and this time medical

20

testimony about the fact of the body’s discovery,

21

fact that the body was dead, and the fact that the body

22

shewed evidence of sexual abuse, and the fact that the

23

body appeared to have been suffocated was introduced in

24

the record on an inevitable discovery theory.

25

the

occurred in the automobile as the Respondent was

2

transported from Davenport to Res Heines.
Mow, we’ve had suggestions in Respondent’s

3

brief

that a Sixth Amendment claim is involved here.

5

Let me point out to you that the ability of the

6

Respondent to cross-examine the witnesses at trial who

7

testified with respect to the medical condition cf the

8

body was fully protected.
In fact, if you glance at the trial record

9

10

you’ll see not only was there rigorous cross-examination

11

of the coroner who testified about the condition of the

12

body,

tut the defense introduced three medical witnesses

3

to attempt to build a case in a different direction from

4

that of the State.

5

And to show that there is no Sixth Amendment

6

violation independently here in the admission of medical

7

testimony, I submit to you the following hypothetical.

8

Supposing an attorney was traveling in the car with

9

Respondent and fully protecting his rights under

20

Miranda, Fifth Amendment rights and so forth.

22

It would

Three courts that have considered the matter

23

— the state trial court, the Iowa Supreme Court, which

24

reviews constitutional issues de novo, and the federal

25

district court — have said that the body would have

2

still at large the body would have been discovered in

3

any event,

that have considered the matter.

Indeed, if Respondent was

What specific richt of the

Respondent did the Eighth Circuit find was violated?
MR. APPEIi

The Fighth Circuit opinion

14

basically says, if I can characterize it correctly, that

15

in order to invoke inevitable discovery the State has

16

the burden of showing absence of bad faith.

17

Eighth Circuit said:

analysis, we look tc the subjective intent of the

19

officer, and that is whether the officer intended tc

20

elicit information in the absence of counsel, and

21

therefore we must reverse.

was traveling along Interstate 80 7 miles north

The

10

searchers were traveling in automobiles and snowmobiles,

11

with specific direction to go down and look in ditches

12

or any area that might be weeded, and so forth.

13

The body in fact was found about two and a

14

half miles in front of the search where the search had

15

been discontinued.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. APPEL:

18

QUESTION:

After he pointed cut where it was.
That's correct yes.
I gather your point is that the

19

evidence said they were patrolling that whole area;

20

they'd have come upon this particular spot where the

21

body was, is that it?

22

MR. APPEL:

That's correct.

23

Now, admittedly we can't tell this with

I

24

mathematical precision because we can’t remake history,

25

but that's not unusual in the decisions of this Court.

precedents that the mere fact you can't show

the State.

19

I want to contrast this case sharply with the

have a situation where there's no probable cause to

arrest, admittedly.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Dunaway pointed out that this was a specific bootstrap,

2

that they went cut, they arrested the person without

3

probable cause with a view to trying to cleanse the

4

transaction with Miranda and seeing if evidence could be

5

garnered.
That is emphatically not the case here.

6

In

7

Dunaway there's a possibility cf an inducement for

8

illegal conduct because, number one, all of the

9

variables of the transaction are within the control cf

10

the infracting officer, and that is not what we have

11

here.

12

Here we have an independent source.

question of timing.

4

QUESTION;

It's a

Well, are you arguing or are you

5

suggesting or conceding, then, that good faith really

6

after all is a factor in inevitability?

7

ME. APPEL;

Not where there is an independent

ongoing investigation, as there was in this case, that

is analytically distinct from the underlying

20

infraction.

what happened in that car, even if the most able legal

22

strategist had been traveling in the car from Davenport,

That is not and the Eunaway case is the heads

proposition that the Respondent suggests;

will not be worse off for it.

mathematical or scientific certainty.

areas,

10

you say that -

Would you say

that it’s reasonable probability based on common

human experience?
HR. APPEL*

11

I think we go further than that in

12

this particular case.

13

here you have an actual substantial ongoing

14

investigation that's on the verge of recovering the

15

body.

17

It is not really a hypothetical.
QUESTIONi

16

The reason I say that is that

That assumes the conclusion, when

you say it’s "on the verge”.
NR. fiPFEIi

18

Right, it dees assume the

conclusion.

But I want to contrast this to one of those

hypothetical routine police investigations where there

21

is no independent ongoing investigation.

This is far less speculative than

HR. APPEL;

have the burden of showing by a preponderance of

evidence that the body would have been found in any

14

we err — just thinking abstractly, supposing you err in

18

prove it.

That amounts to a penalty on law

All the Petitioner asks here is to put law

21

enforcement back in the status quo before the

22

unconstitutional violation occurred.

23

never applied the exclusionary rule, to the best of ir,v

24

knowledge, in a context that in fact puts law

25

enforcement in a position that’s worse off.

This Court has

13

And it seems to me that Michigan v. Tucker is

1

2

entirely instructive in that particular point.

3

Michigan and Tucker/ as you knew, there was a Miranda

4

warning that was defective.

5

sense that the accused was net informed of the right to

6

counsel should he be indigent, and various incriminating

7

statements were obtained from the accused.

It was defective in the

In that case this Court held, number one, the

Why?

Because when

10

Hennessey appeared in a court cf law his attorney was

11

able to fully cross-examine the derivative evidence.

12

Number

13

direct evidence was suppressed, i.e. the fact that the

14

witness made the statements, that was sufficient

15

16

been obtained was certainly not worth the candle.

17

two, in Michigan v. Tucker it was said, since the

The marginal deterrence that might have

In this particular case, evidence cf the most

18

highly probative character, the fact that the Respondent

19

actually led police to the body and therefore knew

20

personally of the whereabouts, has already been

21

suppressed.

22

counsel has been infracted.

23

No additional Sixth Amendment right tc

This is not an attenuation case.

We hear in

24

the Respondent's brief citations to Brown v. Illinois

25

and to Eunaway.

Again, this is an independent source

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

case,

with a bit cf a twist.

This Court has not yet had

2

the opportunity to hold that inevitable discovery

3

applies in a context where an independent investigation

4

is on the verge of discovery, though in Crews v. United

5

States, part D of the opinion, that three Justices

6

signed, we come very close where the three Justices note

7

that, notwithstanding the fact that the identification

8

of the accused was made through an illegal arrest, there

9

was already an ongoing investigation and it had focused

10

on the suspect, who was dcwr. at the Washington ffcnuirent,

11

and the evidence was within the grasp cf police.
In the attenuation cases it's like dominoes.

12
13

There is causation.

There's no independent ongoing

14

investigation.

15

too many dominoes, 50 dominoes, 100 dominoes, and it

16

gets too far down the line to say that the evidence was

17

obtained at exploitation of the underlying conduct.

18

probably where there's a live witness involved that

19

counts for 50 dominoes.

And at some stage we say, hey, there's

And

But in this particular case, once again, law

20
21

enforcement does not have the ability to manipulate the

22

variables like you might in an attenuation case, like ir:

23

Dunaway.

24

well, go ahead and arrest without probable cause,

25

cleanse it with Miranda and then see what drops out.

It would be an odd rule of law that said,

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

That might be an incentive for unlawful conduct.

2

that is emphatically net the case here.

3

One other case that this is net.

4

QUESTION;

Put

In other words, you're saying that

5

because nothing in

the directions for the search or the

6

scope of it was based on any response that the

7

Respondent made during the interrogation, it's just not

8

— there's just no causal connection?
MR. APPELs

9
10

end of

11

source rule case.

— that's the end of it.

QUESTION*

12

Precisely, and that should be the

Well,

This is an independent

I'm not -- you could still

13

decide that you've launched all this search ahead cf

14

time and the search wasn’t designed based on anything

15

that he might have said, but nevertheless the search

16

would never have feund him.
MR. APPEIs

17

And that is a matter for the trial

18

court to find, much as in an independent source case,

19

much as in a Kastigar type case, where use immunity has

20

been conferred and then the prosecution comes in and

21

proves in a court of law the independent character cf

22

the' evidence.
So I think it’s very clear, as we focus cn

23
24

this particular case, that what occurred in Williams I

25

is not

relevant.

It has nothing to do with the

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

independent source here.
Now, I want to contrast once again our setting

2
3

with another setting that may be causing the Justices

4

some difficulty, and that's Griffin v. United States,

5

the Circuit Court case cited in the brief.

6

basically Griffin is ccncerned about is a search warrant

What

Aha, we need tc get a

If the rule of law was that I could break in

12

13

and enter this establishment without a warrant and then

14

later come into a court in a bootstrap fashion and say,

15

hey, we had probable cause, it would have been

16

inevitably discovered, once again that would threaten tc

17

eviscerate the Fourth Amendment warrant requirements.

18

But in

19

aveneue of discovery of the evidence and all the

20

variables are within the ccntrcl of the officer on

that the courts, the trial courts, are going tc have to

not unusual.

23

AMICUS SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MS. OBERLY;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
The inevitable discovery doctrine, as Mr.

24

25

interests that this Court’s independent source doctrine

has served for years.

On the one hand, it’s the Court's

2

duty to make sure that the police don't benefit from

3

illegal conduct; and on the other hand, it's also the

4

Court's duty to make sure that society’s interest in

5

convicting guilty defendants isn't frustrated by keeping

6

reliable and untained evidence from a jury.
The inevitable discovery doctrine accomplishes

7
8

both of these purposes, as it has in this case.

9

Evidence that's been obtained only as a result of the

10

Sixth

Amendment violation has been suppressed from the

11

retrial in this case.

12

would have found anyway, as three courts have found in

14

policy interests that I've mentioned are fully served by

position they would have occupied had there been no

that its task is to identify and neutralize the taint

that’s exactly what was done in the retrial of this

in Erewer versus Williams were purged from the second

I’d like to address the two major objections

21

that it forces courts to engage in too much

23

The first is that it undermines the deterrent

Concern about the deterrent effect of the

24

exclusionary rule was what led the Court of Appeals to

25

impose a good faith require irent, or what it called the

1

absence of bad faith, as an element of the inevitable

2

discovery doctrine.

3

deterrence rationale and the absence of bad faith siirply

4

doesn't bear, in our view, any logical relationship to

5

the inevitable discovery doctrine.

But from a practical standpoint the

The argument seems tc be that if there's nc

6
7

good faith requirement then the police would be

8

encouraged to commit constitutional violations by taking

9

shortcuts that would save them time and money, on the

10

thacry that they would knew there'd be nc penalty

11

attached to it because later the prosecution could get

12

the evidence in under inevitable discovery.

13

That seems tc us net very logical thinking to

14

assume that a policeman would engage in, and in fact it

15

seeits tc us that his thinking would be just the

16

opposite.

17

the evidence he wants can be obtained lawfully, the lass

18

incentive there is for him tc commit' s deliberate

19

constitutional violation, because if he does so he knows

20

that he's risking the prosecution, he's risking personal

21

liability, disciplinary actions or civil damages suits

22

against him, and he knews that there's no need to dc it

23

because he's convinced that the evidence he wants can be

24

obtained through lawful means.

25

The more likely a policeman is certain that

Now, on the ether hand, if he's net certain

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that the evidence he wants can be obtained lawfully,

2

then again there's no incentive for him to resort to

3

illegal conduct because he'll have no confidence, nc

4

reason for confidence, that the prosecution would be

5

able tc successfully make use of the inevitable

6

discovery doctrine.

7

So in either event we think it's just not a

8

rational prediction cf how policemen would think tc

9

assume that if the inevitable discovery doctrine is

10

embraced by this Court it would encourage police tc take

11

unconstitutional shortcuts.

12

I also agree fully with Mr.

13

analytical perspective good faith is completely

14

irrelevant to the inevitable discovery doctrine.

15

whole premise of the doctrine is that the initial taint,

16

whether Sixth Amendment or Fourth Amendment violation,

17

has been purged and the evidence in the retrial is

18

admitted —

of Sixth Amendment violation produces a different

Amendment violation?

The typical right tc counsel

violation occurs at trial or has something to do with

11

what's produced for a trial, but Kassiah results in

12

discovering of evidence that the state wouldn't have had

13

if it hadn't been for the violation.

14

Why shouldn't that be treated the same way

15

that other violations of constitutional rights which

produce evidence that the prosecution wouldn't have had

be treated, such as the Fourth Amendment or Miranda?
MR. BARTELSs

18

Well, Your Honor, in all of

19

these cases I don't think it's clear that the state

20

would not have had the statute otherwise, and the Court

21

has never looked at the problem in that way before, at

22

least.

23

We're talking, in this case there is no

was obtained as a direct result of the violation of the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

in Weatherford versus Eursey, there is no completed

contrary to that position?

16

MR. BARTELSi

Well, Your Honor, I have net had

17

a chance to look at Morrison, which wasn’t cited in any

18

of the briefs,

and so I can only speak from my

19

reccllecticn.

Put my recollection of Morrison was that

20

the issue was whether an interference with

21

communications and relationship between attorney and the

22

accused was going to result in dismissal of the

23

indictment, and what this Court said was that sanction

24

was not necessary.

25

Now, that's completely consistent with the

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

view that what the right to counsel at the pretrial

2

stages is all about is tc protect the defendant from

3

having the state elicit from him for use at trial seme

4

evidence without his having the assistance of a lawyer

5

who can advise him about the consequences of giving that

6

kind of information and his rights with regard to giving

7

that kind of information.

that the state court relied on an inaccurate and

Now, my point is that there are serious questions raised

about this, and it illustrates one of the difficulties,

one of the practical, pragmatic difficulties with the

so-called inevitable discovery doctrine, and that is

17

that one ends up having to resolve hypothetical disputes

about the probative value was really part of the

discussion of the social cost cf excluding evidence,

is to elicit information and then use it at trial,

YffCA building and took it out in the country and buried

it.

That's —
MR. BARTELS;

12

That's correct, Your Honor, and

13

that theory is supported by some evidence that Mr.

14

Williams has no control over.

15

QUESTION;

But would you admit that, with this

16

kind of a picture, there is a social cost the other

way ?

18

HR. BARTEIS;

Your Honor, there is always a

19

social cost, and believe me, I know about it.

20

years I have been on the same case.

22

ME. BARTELS:

24

costs are attributable to the fact that the State

introduced this evidence in violation of the Defendant's

Mr. Bartels, is there any

good faith argument?

11

MR. BARTFIS;

12

QUESTION;

I’m sorry, Your Honor?

The good faith argument was

13

advanced and relied on by the Eighth Circuit Court cf

14

Appeals, an absence of good faith.
MR. BARTFIS;

15

Well, Your Honor, if this Court

16

were tc adopt my Sixth Amendment theory, as it should,

17

the Court of Appeals analysis is really unnecessary.

18

The Court of Appeals was trying to avoid —

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BEENT R. APPEL, ESC.

11

ON BEHALF CF PETITIONER

12

MR. APPEL;

Mr. Chief Justice;

13

It seems to me clear that we would have to

14

rewrite a number of the cases in order to sustain

15

Petitioner's position.

16

held that the testimony from the additional witness

17

found did not violate Sixth Amendment rights because of

18

the full possibility to cross-examine, is a case

19

involved .

20

Michigan v. Tucker, where it was

The Court would do well to recognize Justice

21

Frankfurter’s admonition that facts do not become sacred

22

and inaccessible simply because of underlying conduct.

23

There is no Sixth Amendment violation here from the

24

introduction of the evidence where the Respondent’s

25

counsel's role as legal strategist, as discussed in the

54

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Ashe case, is fully preserved, as it has been here, and

2

as a result the admission of testimony about the body

3

was a hard blow, but not a

4

constitutionally foul one.

And in closing, this is not the kind of case

5

where a police officer can manipulate the law, i.e.,

6

cleanse an illegal transaction with Miranda in order to

7

obtain some kind of collateral purpose.

8

you that this is not the kind cf case, if you sustain

9

the Petitioner's position,

And I submit to

that will provide seme kind

10

of inducement for law enforcement to substitute brawn

11

for brains as a key instrumentality cf crime detection.

For the above reasons, I respectfully submit

Thank you, gentlemen.
