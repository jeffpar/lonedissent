ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY L. PITT, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

12

MR. PITT*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
At issue in this case is a dividing holding of

13

the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia

14

Circuit which upheld a Federal Reserve Board ruling

15

permitting Bankers Trust Company to market and corporate

16

commercial paper notes for the first time since the

17

Glass-Steagall Act was passed nearly 50 years ago.

18

Both the Federal Reserve Board and the Court

19

of Appeals concluded that the Glass-Steagall Act should

20

be given a narrower reading than the literal language or

21

its unmistakable legislative purposes would dictate.

22

The court below in essence directed that the Federal

23

Reserve Board should be free on a case by case basis to

24

adapt the Glass-Steagall Act's flat prohibitions to

25

current business reality and changing financial needs of

1

our economy
It is our contention in this Court that that

2
3

decision should, be reversed, first because it ignores

4

the plain language and leaves our financial system open

5

to precisely the hazards that Congress had in mind when

6

it enacted the Glass-Steaga11 Act over 50 years age.

7

Second, it’s inconsistent with the specific policy

8

choice

that Congress made.
When Congress considered the Glass-Steagall

9
10

Act and the dangers that had given rise to that statute,

11

it had before it the choice of absolute prohibition or

12

case by case regulation with delegation to an

13

administrative agency.

14

chose absolute prohibition, as this Court has twice

15

noted.

10

undoing the specific policy choice the Congress had

17

made.

18

Congress rejected regulation and

For that reason, the court below erred in

And finally, the decision below represents a

19

bad policy choice that not only is not justified by the

20

statute and by its legislative history, but that, as

21

recent events have shown, will substitute litigation and

22

case by case administrative revisionism for resolving

23

what bank activities are appropriate.

24

the first time in our history as a country and as a

25

nation that any court has done so.

This would mark

The factual background of this case is

2

relatively simple and straightforward.

3

Trust Company, which is a state bank which is a member

4

of the

5

commercial paper notes issued by third party

6

corporations.

7

was legal, not because the statute didn't cover it, bat

8

because the statute shouldn't be read to cover it even

9

though its literal terms so provided.

10

In

1978 Rankers

Federal Reserve System, began underwriting

The Federal Reserve Board ruled that this

The court said -- the Federal Reserve Board

11

said that commercial paper is more like a bank loan,

12

even though it is conceded that the bank is not lending

13

anyone any money in the activity of distributing and

14

underwriting commercial paper.

15

QUESTION;

16

forbidden such a thing before?

17

MR. PITTi

Had the Board ever expressly

The Board has never expressly

18

forbidden such a thing, because the statute has

19

forbidden it.

20
21
22

QUESTION;

And because no one has ever asked

them before?
MR. PITT;

That is correct.

But I might point

23

out that since the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act 10

24

bank has ever underwritten commercial paper?

25

QUESTION;

Or even asked to be permitted to?

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

MR. PITT;

1
2

No bank has asked the Federal

Reserve Board to be permitted to do sc.

3

QUESTION;

Were banks even doing that at the

4

time of the enactment of the Glass-Steaga11 Act?

5

of sensed in reading the briefs that the Glass-Steagall

6

Act was not directed in its terms to that practice, and

7

I wondered if banks say in the twenties, before the

8

Glass-Steagall Act was passed, actually were doing

9

that.
MR. PITT;

10

I kind

There were some isolated instances
Rut by and

11

of banks underwriting commercial paper.

12

large,

13

passage of the Glass-Steagall Act was for banks to

14

purchase commercial paper, which is the equivalent of

15

making a loan, and of course there is express authority

16

for banks to do that.

17

the overwhelming function at the time of the

In our system banks are permitted to do that

18

which is expressly provided, and they may not do that

19

which is not expressly permitted.

20

Glass-Steagall Act takes that regime a step further and

21

says that banks, particularly state member banks and

22

national banks and all banks, may not underwrite

23

commercial paper notes.

24
25

In this case,

the

It is unmistakable from the language of the
statute that the statute prohibits the underwriting of

6

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

notes,

and no one disputes that issue in this case.

2

question is whether the Board is free to say that some

3

notes will be treated in accordance with the literal

4

language of the statute and other notes will not he

5

treated in accordance with the literal language of the

6

statute.
QUESTION :

7

Mr. Pitt, you agree with the

8

Government that commercial paper is not an investment

9

security as that term is used in Section 16?
MR. PITT:

10

The

Your Honor, I would state that the

11

Government is correct that commercial . papar is not

12

presently defined as an investment security.

13

might add here that Section 16 of the Glass-Steaga11 Act

And I

14

QUESTION:

15

I'm a little unclear.

Is

16

commercial paper an investment security in the meaning

17

of the

18

term in Section 16?
MR. PITT:

The point I am making, Your Honor,

19

is that the term is not — that within the meaning of

20

that term, commercial paper is not an investment

21

security because the Comptroller of the Currency, an

22

entity that is not involved in this case, has never

23

defined commercial paper as an investment security.

24
25

QUESTION:

But how about the statute?

I mean,

was it intended that investment security incorporate

7

1

commercial paper by Congress?

2

ME. PITT:

There is no indication that the

3

statute need exclude commercial paper from that

4

context.

It is simply not — it is not discussed.
But the term "investment security". Your

6

Honor, does not have any relevance to the issue in this

7

case.

8

dealing with a specific bar. . In Section 21 the statute

9

says that it is unlawful for any entity that engages in

The reason I state that is that we are here

10

issuing, underwriting, selling or distributing funds,

11

notes, debentures securities, and other securities from

12

also taking deposits.
The term "notes" is specifically used in

13
14

Section 21 without any qualifier and without any

15

reference to investment securities or otherwise, and

16

thus for this purpose it's irrelevant whether one deems

17

commercial paper to be an investment security or not.
Section 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act has a

flat prohibition.

20

any national bank to underwrite any issue of securities

or stock.

whatsoever in that prohibition.

It says that it shall be unlawful for

There is absolutely no qualification

There are provisions in Section 16, however,

24

which indicate -- and this is the critical facet of the

25

structure of the Glass-Steagall Act -- that when

8

In Section 21, in 1935 Congress amended the

7

provisions of Section 21 specifically to provide that

banks might underwrite mortgage notes, because there had

been the claim that mortgage notes would be encompassed

Do you disagree,

then, with Judge

15

Wilkie's opinion's reading of the word "notes" in

16

Section 21?

17

MR. PITT*

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Judge

18

Wilkie's reading, which I think was a narrowing, and he

19

conceded it was a narrowing, of the literal language,

20

suggested that when one looks at the various entities

21

that precede the word "notes" -- the statute reads

22

"stocks, bonds, debentures, notes and other securities"

23

-- that one ought to view "notes" as potentially meaning

24

notes for the raising of capital for permanent purposes

25

for corporations.

Where he found those words we are not certain

1

2

but they don't appear on the face of the statute.

3

Moreover, he seized upon three factors which he

4

indicated would determine when a note would be within

5

the statute and not.

6

to and that the Board has alluded to in this case are

7

the denominations of the notes, the nature of the

8

purchasers, and whether the notes were of prime

9

qualit y.

10

The three factors that he alluded

None of those things have to do with whether

11

the note is being used to raise capital or not.

So that

12

after having totally taken the statute out of context

13

and then relying on factors that bear no resemblance to

14

the specific criteria he applied, he concluded that

15

commercial paper notes were not within the statute.

16

QUESTIONS

This is his functional analysis?

17

ME. PITT:

This is his functional analysis and

18

the Board's functional analysis.

19

that functional analysis is precisely what the evil in

20

this case is, because it substitutes a regime of case by

21

case regulation for what Congress decided ought to be an

22

absolute prohibition.

23

And I might add that

This is one of the instances in that period of

24

legislation in which Congress said:

25

Government regulation? we want prohibition? and when we

We will not rely on

think a bank ought to be able to engage in activity, vs

2

will so specify.

3

of those specifications.

And there have been numerous examples

As I have indicated,

4

in the relevant universe

5

of the statute, Sections 21 and 16,

there are two major

6

categories that Congress deals with in the

7

Glass-Steagall Act.

8

the Glass-Steagall relates, and second are the

One are the instruments to which

activities which are prohibited.
A careful review of the statute shows that

10
11

both the instruments to which the statute relates and

12

the activities prohibited are all-encompassing.

13

are no activities that are not governed by this

14

statute.

There

One need only look at the listing of terms —

16
16

stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, and other securities

17

-- to understand that Congress had in mind all

18

instruments by which corporations obtain any form of

1

capital.

20

'

Second, when one looks at the specific

21

activities in the statute, it is equally clear that

22

Congrsss parsed out and covered every conceivable

23

activity that a bank could engage in in the context of

24

these instruments.

The statute is unmistakable in terms of its
breadth and its scope.

3

QUESTION*

Mr. Pitt, very naturally you're

4

emphasizing the language that's found in Section 21,

5

rather than the language in Section 16.

6

is Section

7

In your view,

16 totally redundant?
MR. PITT*

8

redundant.

9

national banks.

No, Your Honor, it is not totally

Section 16 by its terms applies only to
Section 21 applies to any

10

deposit-taking institution.

Both contain co-egual

11

prohibitions on underwriting, but Sections 16 and 21

12

have different formulations with respect to certain

13

activities of banks that are not involved in this case.

14

For example, with respect to investment securities,

15

there are distinctions that are made in Section 16 that

18

are not made in Section 21 for different types of

17

entities.
But both provisions are unmistakable in

18
19

providing the universe of deposit-taking institutions,

20

that they may not underwrite notes or other securities.

21

QUESTION*

Well,

2

QUESTION:

Eight.

3

MR. PITT:

And one need only look, to Section

4

21 to indicate that the term "securities” obviously must

5

include notes by virtue of the form of Section 21, which

6

starts with stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, and then

7

says "and other securities."

8

intended a note to be a security within the meaning of

9

both provisions.
QUESTION:

10
11

It is clear that Congress

But certainly not all notes,

thougn , are included?

12

MR. PITT:

I'm sorry?

13

QUESTION:

I assume that all notes are not

14

covered by Section 21.

15

participations or bankers acceptances, maybe even cash,

16

they're not included, are they?
MR. PITT:

17

Certificates of deposit or loan

No, that is not correct.

There ire

has not referred to any.

9

context of this case attempted to establish that certain

The Government has in the

10

activities, some of which are questionable, may be

11

foreclosed by this Court’s decision.

12

two simple answers to that.

13

I think there are

First, this case only involves commercial

14

paper,

notes that are clearly within the meaning of the

15

statutory term, not only because they fit literally but

16

because there’s contemporaneous Congressional evidence

17

that Congress intended commercial paper to be included

18

within the scope of that statute.
QUESTION;

19

What about a bank which, instead of

20

underwriting notes in the language of Section 21, were

21

to simply issue -- is a certificate of deposit a note

22

that’s

23
24
25

issued by the bank?
MR. PITT;

A certificate of deposit is, and

banks have express authority to issue notes.
QUESTION;

So that the prohibition against

14
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

them issuing notes in Section 21 somehow doesn't prevail

2

over the other language?

3

MS. PITT;

The prohibition in Section 21 has

4

to be read with respect to the express authority that

5

banks are also granted, and banks are granted the

6

authority to discount and --

7

QUESTION;

Well, perhaps I haven't adequately

8

read the briefs.

Where else are these express

9

authorities granted, and what's the point of having

10

Section 21, which prohibits a bunch of stuff, if it's

11

all granted somewhere else?

12

MR. PITT;

Well, first of all, with respect to

13

national banks Section 16 sets forth the express powers

14

of those banks.

15

many of the restrictions and provisions of Section 16

16

are provided to state member banks.

17

With respect to state member banks,

Section 21, which deals with any depository

18

institution, is basically silent as to the affirmative

19

powers of depository institutions, and that means that

20

whatever affirmative powers they have, as this Court has

21

22
23

QUESTION;

But it's not silent as to what it

prohibits, I take it.

24

MR. PITT;

That is correct.

25

QUESTION;

It prohibits any organization

15

1

engaged in the business of issuing notes from taking

2

d e p os i t s.

3

ME. PITT;

Section 21 defines a depository

4

institution within its terms as one that may issue

5

certificates of deposits and other instruments for the

6

conduct of banking business.

7

language of Section 21, Your Honor, it defines the term

8

"deposit-taking institution" as an institution that

9

receives deposits subject to check or to repayment upon

If you look at the precise

10

presentation of a passbook, certificate of deposit, or

11

other evidence of debt.

12

Within Section 21 itself, it expressly

13

recognizes that these are traditional banking functions

14

and uses them to define the entities that are within its

15

prohibition.

16

QUESTION;

Well,

but then a bank that does

17

that sort of business, that receives deposits, along

18

those lines, can’t issue a certificate of deposit?

19

ME. PITT;

That is correct.

A bank that

20

receives deposits may issue a certificate of deposit,

21

but it may not — one of the guestions is it may not

22

engage in a marketing scheme.

23

individual investors, individual depositors in return

24

for a certificate of deposit which bears interest.

25

is expressly contemplated by Section 21 and it’s

It may obtain funds from

banking statutes.
QUESTION':

3

Did I understand you to say that

4

they nust hold that certificate, then?

The relationship

5

between the bank and the holder of the CD, what about

6

that?

7

MR. PITT:

Whether they need to hold that —

8

QUESTION:

Can you describe that relationship

9

other than, obviously, a debt?
MR. PITT:

10
11

Well, the certificate of deposit in

that rase is held of course by the depositors.
QUESTION:

12

Did you describe that as a note in

13

response to Justice Rehnquist?

14

MR. PITT:

I’m not certain I’m following Your

QUESTION:

Is it a note of the bank when it’s

MR. PITT:

It is in form a note of the bank

15

Honor.

16
17
18

held?

19

when it is held by the depositor.

20

it is not a note that the bank is underwriting or

21

engaging in any prohibited activity, because banks raise

22

capital by issuing notes and that is a permissible

23

activity within Section 21.

24
25

In form it is.

But

The contemporaneous legislative history of the
Glass-Steagall Act I think makes quite clear that

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

commercial paper is both a note and a security for

2

purposes of these prohibitions.

3

Court's decision in the Camp case, which held that the

4

term "security" should be construed broadly, not

5

literally but broadly and flexibly to accomplish its

6

purpos e.

We start with this

just

Indeed, in the four decisions of this Court

7
8

that have defined terms in the Glass-Steagall Act this

9

Court has continually urged that those terms are not to

10

be given a narrow or restrictive reading, but are to be

11

given

12

that they be given at a minimum their literal reading,

13

as well as accomplishing the regulatory purposes.

14

a broad reading.

In this case, we simply urge

The structure of the Glass-Steagall Act, as

15

I*ve indicated, confirms that "notes" were intended to

16

have its plain meaning.

17

other legislation, both contemporaneously and other

18

banking legislation, it is clear that when Congress

19

When one goes back to the Glass-Steagall Act

which are not guidelines issued under the Glass-Steagal1

QUESTION:

So the term "notes” in Section 21

authority the Federal Reserve Bank gives to people like

21

the bank here?

22

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Justice Rehnquist, no,

the

23

word "notes" in Section 21 must mean the same thing.

24

But if the word "note" does not encompass commercial

25

notes beyond those involved in this case, the Federal

those other kind of notes, even though they're not

QUESTION;

5

Well, why shouldn't the word

6

''notes'* in the language of Section 21 of the

7

Glass-Steagall Act be given its normal meaning?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

8
9

Well, "normal" is perhaps

jumping to the conclusion too quickly. Justice

10

Rehnqaist.

The word "note” appears in Section 21 in a

11

list which includes bonds and debentures and stocks.

12

Bonds and debentures, as we know, are long-term notes.

13

The perhaps most natural way to read Section 21 is to

14

say to oneself, the word "note" must include something

15

like a bond or a debenture, something of relatively long

16

term -QUESTION;

17

Well, why is that logical?

It

18

seems to me if you have three words and two of them are

19

long term, it would be perfectly reasonable to say,

20

well, they must have put the third term in to mean short

21

term.

22

MR. CLAIBORNE:

I'm only suggesting that one

23

of the ways of construing an enumeration of words is to

24

define each by the company it keeps, and not to suppose

25

that there's a sudden jump to an entirely different sort

QUESTION;

Eut in that sequence of words, the

3

first word is "stocks", which of course are very

4

disparate from bonds or debentures.

5

MR. CLAIBORNE;

But there is this in common

6

between stocks and the bonds and the debentures;

7

are all things in which it is customary to view

8

investment activity, whereas short-term commercial paper

9

is not the sort of thing in which people invest.

10

they

They are not, also, offered to the general

11

public, unlike bonds, debentures and stocks, which have

12

that in common, that there are public offerings.

13

But this is not the only reason why "notes" in

14

Section 21 ought not be given the broad reading.

15

Section 21, after all, is not the section addressed

16

directly to banks;

17

read into Section 21 anything that isn’t in Section 16

18

as a prohibition.

19

it's Section 16.

And we oughtn’t to

Indeed, there's a proviso to Section 21 which

20

tells us precisely that;

Nothing which is permitted in

21

Section 16 is prohibited by this section,

22

notwithstanding, in effect, the broadness of the terms

23

as some untutored person might read it.
/

24
25

It is natural to attempt to avoid a clash
between the two sections.

Now, when we look at Section

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

16, we cannot reach the conclusion that commercial paper

2

is a security within the meaning of that section, and

3

the damonstration is quite simple.

4

T-7e know that commercial paper is not an

5

investment security.

We know that as a matter of common

6

sense, but we also know it because those words are

7

derived from the McFadden Act and we have the

8

legislative history of the McFadden Act, in which thece
is an express exchange in which the Congressman said,

10

no, commercial paper is not viewed by anybody as an

11

investment security, and when we are legislating about

12

investment securities we do not mean to include

13

commercial paper.

14

QUESTION*

Mr. Claiborne, that really sounds

15

amazingly simple, clear as a bell, and I just can't

10

understand why it took bright bank lawyers so many years

17

to discover that Glass-Steagall Sections 25 or 21 had

18

absolutely nothing to do with this.

1

MR. CLAIBORNE*

Your Honor, it didn't take

20

bright lawyers so long to come to this conclusion.

21

fact is that banks had been purchasing commercial paper

22

since long before Glass-Steagall.

No.

It’s against their

interests to underwrite when they could earn more by

15

Underwriting is the least attractive

So it was with reluctance that banks came to

18

acting as dealers in commercial paper.

They much

19

preferred being the issuer, the purchaser, of the

20

commercial paper.

21

the commercial paper found that banks were unable to

22

provide them the funds that they went elsewhere, found a

23

market elsewhere to sell their paper.

24

gradually, realizing that the business had gone from

them, decided the next best thing to do was to attempt

9

understanding is --

10

QUESTION;

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. CLAIBORNE;

But my

You sound pretty good.

-- that because of regulations

13

by the Federal Reserve Board limiting the interest that

14

could be paid by banks, the deposits which they had to

15

lend were limited, and accordingly the demand for funis

16

had to find a source elsewhere and did find it

17

elsewhere, so the banks were no longer the almost sole

18

purchasers of the paper, but insurance companies and

19

others began lending on commercial paper.

20
21

22

QUESTION;

Well, they wanted to compete with

the investment banking industry too, didn't they?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

As we view it, Justice

23

Blackmun, this is not an investment banking operation.

24

It is an arrangement of a loan, something which is

25

proper for commercial banks to be doing, something

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

traditionally which they have done.

2

no different than a sale of a participation in a loan.

3

It is therefore an attempt to recapture seme small part

4

of a /°ry traditional commercial banking activity.

It is functionally

Now, in our view there are at least three

5

6

independent supports for the conclusion we draw.

First,

7

the literal passing of the statute leads us to the

8

conclusion that, since commercial paper is not an

9

investment security, it therefore must be, if covered, a

10

security.

And yet, we know that commercial banks are

11

forbidden to purchase securities, except investment

12

securities.

13

and may continue to purchase commercial paper.

14

Therefore, commercial paper cannot be a security within

15

the meaning of Section 16.

And yet, we know that commercial banks have

Now, the answer given to this seemingly

16
17

unanswerable argument is that the purchase of commercial

18

paper is authorized by the first portion of Section 16,

19

which is in fact a holdover from the Banking Act of

20

1864.

21

appears that the Glass-Steagall Act was not amending the

22

Banking Act and changing the traditional activities of

23

banks.

24

and saying, as the text suggests, now with respect to

25

something else, dealing in securities, the rules shall

That is a very awkward way to look about it.

It

It was simply turning to a wholly new subject

34
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

be the following.

2

And it appears that that category of dealing

3

in securities is nothing to do with the discounting or

4

negotiation o* promissory notes, an activity which

5

before and since has been authorized to banks.

6

The legislative history of Glass-Steagall

7

again leads us to the same conclusion.

It is no

8

inadvertence that the text fails to deal with commercial

9

paper dealings, because bank purchases of commercial

10

paper were common long before Glass-Steagall and

11

continued to be so afterwards and were so at the time it

12

was enacted.

13

Congress had occasion to focus if it wished to

14

deal with commercial paper, but did not do so.

15

contrary, the only mention of commercial paper in the

16

legislative history of Glass-Steagall is a regret that

17

banks have abandoned their good old habits of loaning on

18

commercial paper and have turned to dealing,

19

underwriting, and otherwise involving themselves with

20

Hr. Claiborne, is it possible that

a bank could end up in a position of conflict of

underwritten and sold its commercial paper, and after

3

the sale of the commercial paper the bank began to

12

QUESTION:

And would an investment banking

house have a similar possibility of conflict?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

It seems to us that when the

13

bank is merely the agent for the sale, with no

14

obligation to take up any portion of the issue which is

15

unsold, that its involvement with the commercial paper

16

is at its minimum, far less than when it’s the purchaser

17

of the commercial paper and then has a real interest in

18

assuring that there isn’t a default because it will be

19

the loser, whereas when it's the agent someone else will

20

be the loser and the reputation of the bank may be

21

marginally at stake, but at least it will not be its

22

depositors who are directly injured.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS - RESUMED

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Nr. Claiborne, you may

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and snay it please the Court:
I’ve only one short point remaining.

It is

10

this:

that commercial paper, because it is

11

indistinguishable from a short-term commercial loan, has

12

always

13

regulators.

14

the joint appendix, in which the Board’s statement in

15

this case is reproduced at page 130.

16

beginning at the bottom of that page, the Board says the

17

following:

been so treated by all three of

the bank

And if I can draw the Court's attention to

The paragraph

"The present attitude of the bank regulatory

18

agencies is consistent with the view that commercial

20

paper is properly viewed as a loan, not as an investment

21

security.

22

banking agencies for preparation of call reports direct

23

that commercial paper be treated as a loan.

24

addition, the Federal Reserve’s Manual of Examination

25

Procedures follows the same position.”

The instructions of each of the three federal

That of course is relevant on a day to day

2

basis for each bank to determine whether the limits

applicable to loans or the limits applicable to

4

investment securities are applicable when it takes in

5

commercial paper into its inventory.

6

day, the banking fraternity, with the approval and

7

indeed at the direction of the banking regulators, has

8

treated commercial paper in the category of loans, not

9

investment or security.

10

From 1927 to this

Now, this kind of decision as to which

11

category commercial paper falls in is precisely one as

12

to which there is properly owed deference to the bank

13

regulators.

14

side, that Congress made the Board or the Comptroller

15

regulators in the sense that they were given discretion

18

to waive in appropriate cases the prohibitions of the

17

Glass-Steagall Act.

18

It is not, as is suggested on the other

Of course they have no such discretion.

But

19

they do have a job to construe, to interpret the words

20

of the statute which they are required to enforce.

21

it is in that sense that deference is due to their

22

special expertise.

23

QUESTION:

And

Well, do you think, Mr. Claiborne,

24

that if the Board had construed it the other way, that

25

the banks couldn't do this, that they would have been

HR. CLAIFORNE;

Honor.

In hindsight, yes, Your

But it doesn't —

4

QUESTIO:- ;

Well, so that there’s only one way

5

the statute can be read as far as you’re concerned?

6

it isn’t a question of deference; it’s just a question

7

of reading the statute.
HR. CLAIBORNE;

8
9

So

Well, I can say on the one

hand that it seems the inevitable reading in light of

10

the plain language of the statute, the result which the

11

Board came to, but at the same time say that if I am

12

wrong in that respect and there are two reasonable

13

readings, so long as the Boari made a reasonable

14

reading, deference ought to be accorded to that

15

readin g.
QUESTION;

16

But your statutory construction

17

argument it seems to me wouldn’t leave any room for the

18

Board to go the other way.
HR. CLAIBORNE;

19

20

I quite agree.

But I may be

wrong —
QUESTION;

21

Do you think that you — do you

22

think

that your position on the statute is consistent

23

with what the Board thinks the statute means?

24

HR. CLAIBORNE;

25

QUESTION;

I see no --

I thought the Board would have

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

thought it could go either way on this case.

2

MB. CLAIBORNE;

The Board did not, as is

3

alleged, say that the statute literally read the other

4

way.

S

eye be read to mean something different, but when we

6

read it in context, when we read it against the

7

legislative history, when we real Section 16 and Section

8

21 together, then we reach what the Board called the

9

stronger position.

The Board said the statute could hy the untutored

QUESTIONS

10

But it still would have been

11

permissible in their view to go the other way, I

12

suppos e?
HR. CLAIBORNE;

13

It's difficult to construe

14

whether by "stronger" they meant — they were simply

15

being cautious or whether they were being less

16

positive.

17

But in all events, we do urge that on the

18

matter of construction the Board, if there is a doubt

19

about it, is entitled to the deference in this

20

peculiarly complex area.

21

QUESTION;

Mr. Claiborne, one other question,

22

and I hope it is in proper bounds.

Has this position

23

had an impact on the enforcement of other laws, like the

24

securities laws?

25

has it had an impact, for example, on the Securities and

Has this construction by the Board,

Exchange Coramision and their regulation?
MR. CLAIBORNE*

My impression is not so

3

because, with respect to the securities laws, it's

4

perfectly clear that, while commercial paper is a

5

covered security, it is exempted from the registration

6

requirement.

7

of a peculiar kind of commercial piper in the securities

8

laws, so the two are meshed.

9

And the Board has looked to the definition

Let me say one final thing about the deference

10

due to the Board.

11

twice said, both in ICI I and in ICI II, about the

12

deference that is indeed due to the regulators, whether

13

the Comptroller or the Board, provided however, which is

14

what was lacking in ICI I, that that regulator not

15

merely announce a rule, but do so by articulating his

16

reasons for having got there in what is certainly

17

present here, a comprehensive and careful parsing of

18

legislative text, the legislative history, the policy as

19

identified by this Court which informed the passage of

20

the Act, and only then, after this careful articulation,

21

reach a conclusion.

22

I need only invoke what this Court

In those circumstances, as the Court indicated

23

would be true when that was done, the Board ought be

24

entitled to this deference.

QUESTION*

Hr. Claiborne, do you think it's

1

perfectly clear that Congress would have exempted banks

from the securities regulation field if they had thought

that ill commercial paper was excluded from the

MR. CLAIBORNE;

5
6

I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor.

I must have missed the —
QUESTION;

7

Well, it's your position, I take

8

it, that banks are not considered brokers and dealers

9

under

10

the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act,

right?

Is that correct?

11

MR. CLAIBORNE;

12

QUESTION;

That is correct.

Okay.

Is it perfectly clear that

13

the banks would have been so treatad if Congress had

14

understood that all commercial paper was outside the

15

scope of Glass-Steagall?

16

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Well, I think that is probably

17

so, because Congress was aware that banks were dealing

18

in bankers acceptances, not yet in certificates of

19

deposit.

20

that iealing in certificates of deposit is not in any

21

way prohibited by the Glass-Steagall Act and

22

nevertheless the banks are not required to register as

23

dealers under the Securities Act.

24
25

But it seems to be accepted all around that

Hr. Pitt, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY L. PITT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. PITTi

If I may.

In response to the

11

questions both by Justice Phite and Justice O'Connor, I

12

would 'refer the Court to page 26, note 33, of the SIA's

13

opening brief, which indicates that both the Federal

14

Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities Exchange

15

Commission hal to take emergency action to obviate the

16

impact on both the federal energy laws and the SEC's

17

authority under the Public Utility Holding Company Act

18

because of the Board's unprecedented ruling involving

19

management interlocks and related issues.

20

Secondly, in response to Justice O'Connor's

21

question, the SEC has recently promulgated a proposed

22

rule which would undo the very statutory exemption to

23

which Justice O'Connor was referring.

24

the federal securities laws presently exempt banks from

25

the definition of brokers and dealers.

That is to say,

The SEC has said

that,

2

-- and it's the decision in the court below which has

3

been the mainspring from which all of these decisions

4

have flowed — it is necessary for that agency to

5

reconsider whether the exemptions given to banks from

these definitions are appropriate.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Excuse me.

Would you comment on Mr.

Claiborne’s observation as to the position taken by tne

12

three regulatory bank agencies over the years?

13

MR. PITT*

Yes, Your Honor, and I’m pleased

14

you asked me that, because I did want to comment that

15

the positions taken were with respect to commercial

10

paper as a purchase and as a loan.

There has never been

i

17

a position taken prior to the ones that are at issue in

18

this case that banks could underwrite commercial paper.

19

And I might add that Mr. Claiborne’s prior

20

references to the Congressional history demonstrate that

21

Congress intended for banks to purchase commercial

22

paper, and there is clear authority for that, but not to

23

underwrite it, and that's the essence of this case.
