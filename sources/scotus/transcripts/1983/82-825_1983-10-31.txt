ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WILKINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
Three terms ago this Court concluded in
Federal Trade Commission versus Standard Oil Company of

10 California that an administrative complaint should net
11

be subjected to routine judicial review to determine

12 whether it had been properly issued because such review
13 necessarily resulted in

undue delay in the resolution of

14 the administrative proceeding, improperly subjected or
15 rendered the prosecuting agency the Defendant at the
16 very outset of its proceeding, and in the end resulted
17 in unnecessary and piecemeal appellate review.
18

Although this case arises in a somewhat

19 different context, it presents a very similar issue,
20 that is, whether there must be a trial and a consequent
21

judicious or appellate review, with all the attendant

22 delays, cf the question whether or not a complaint under
23 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
24 properly issued.

1964 has been

The practical considerations that

25 compelled this Court’s result in the SOCAL case requires

similar result here.

2

QUESTION;

Kr . Wilkins, you say that one of

3 the issues here is whether there must be a trial.

Even

4 in the days before the Federal Buies of Civil Procedure
5 were adopted and complaints were held to a fairly strict

6 standard of pleading facts,

I don’t think there ever

7 were trials with witnesses called.
8

MR. WILKINS;

I misspoke.

I meant some sort

9 of a hearing, some sort of judicial probing into these
10 facts.
11

On October 16, 1979, Eleanor Holmes North, who

12 was then Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity
13 Commission, issued a sworn Commissioner's complaint
14 against the Respondent, Shell Oil Company, alleging
15 unlawful employment practices of Shell’s Wood River,
16 Illinois, Refinery.
Commissioner Norton stated that she had cause
17
to believe that the Respondent had unlawfully excluded
18
Blacks from managerial, professional, technical, office
19
clerical craft, and service worker positions, and had
20
similarly excluded women from managerial, professional,
21
technical craft, operative labor, and service worker
22
positions.
fl copy of the charge was duly filed or the
23
Respondent, and it was subsequently amended to state
24
that Commissioner Norton had reason to believe that the
25

1

acts had occurred on a continuing basis since at least

2

July 1965.

3

The Commission then began an investigation to

4 determine whether there was reasonable cause to support
5 the allegations of Commissioner Norton's complaint.

The

6 Commission, pursuant to Section 709(a) of the Act,
7 requested the Respondent to provide certain employment
8 inform ation .
9

The Respondent, on the basis of its own

10 statistical analysis, refused, arguing that its
11

employment practices did not -- "Were clearly not the

12

profile anticipated for a Commissioner's charge."

13

After informal methods of administrative

14 investigation failed, the Commission filed a subpoena
15 pursuant to Section 710, and the Respondent filed this
16 action tc squash the subpoena and enjoy the Commission's
17 investigation.

The Respondent argued that Commissioner

18 Norton had not shown sufficient facts to form a basis
19 for her allegations of discrimination.
20

21

The District Court dismissed these factual
specificity arguments as meritless and enforced the

22 Commission's subpoena.

On appeal, the Eighth Circuit

23 reversed, however, finding that there was indeed
24 insufficient factual basis tc support the charge.
25

On denial of a hearing en banc. Chief Judge

Lay of

the Eighth District dissented, stating that the

2 decision placed

the circuit in direct conflict with the

3 decisions of all other courts of appeal addressing the
4 issue of factual allegations in a Title VII charge.
5

QUESTION:

6

MB. WILKINS:

7 far as

Was he alcne in the dissent?
He was alone in the dissent as

I am aware.
As noted by Chief Judge Lay, the single most

8

9 significant characteristic cf the decision below is that
10 it does fly in the face of previously uniform precedent
11

rejecting any factual pleading requirement for Title VII

12 charges.

Indeed, since the decision below was rendered,

13 two additional courts of appeals have looked at the
14 question and have concluded that the factual pleading
15 requirement created by the court below is inappropriate
16 and is not in conformity with the Title VII enforcement
17 sch erne .
18

This Court has recognized that Title VII

19 creates an integrated, multi-step enforcement procedure
20 culminating in

21
22

the Commission’s authority to bring an

enforcement action in Federal Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wilkins, I think that the

23 Eighth Circuit relied on a particular provision of the
24 Civil Bights Act, did it not?
25

MR. WILKINS:

Exactly.

Section 707 of the

3 complaint based upon a suspected pattern or practice of

Section 706(b) requires that that

5 charge be in writing, under oath or affirmation, and
6 contain such information and be in such form as the
7 Commission requires.
8

within

Section 706(b) also requires that

ten days, the Commission serve a copy or a notice

QUESTIONS

What has that got to do with the

23 definition of the terms, date, place, and circum stances
24 that Congress put in the Act.
25

MR. WILKINSs

You have to look at what purpose

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

Congress intended that notice provision to serve.

2

explain in seme detail in our brief, prior to 1972, when

3 that provision was added to the Act,

As we

the Commission, to

4 prevent retaliation against complaining parties,
5 developed a practice or adopted a practice of not
6 serving a notice of the charge or a copy of the charge
7 on the Respondent until Commission staff was available
8

to begin investigation.
Congress was concerned in

9

1972 that this

10 practice resulted in seme delay between the time that
11

the charge was filed and the time the Respondent was

12 aware that the charge was indeed pending.

So it adopted

13 this notice provision to ensure that, in the words of
14 the legislative report, "they would have fair notice
15

that charges were pending against them."
QUESTION*

16

They defined "fair notice" as

17 including the date, place, and circumstances, didn't
18 the y?
19

MR. WlLKINSs

Yes, and this charge fully

20 complied with that requirement.

The charge in this case

21

informed the Respondent that a Commission of the EEOC

22

had reason to believe that it discriminated against

23 Blacks by excluding them from six specifically
24 designated job categories, and women from seven
25 specifically designated job categories since at least

MR. WILKINS*

6

QUESTIONS

7

NR. WILKINSs

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

Nr. Wilkins.
Yes.

Why would the Government not want

9 to provide, in these pattern and practice case, the real
10 circum stances that the Government is relying, the
11

statistical information that they looked at.

What is

12 the matter with furnishing that, to give the Respondent
13 an actual look at what it is that prompted the filing;
14

just don’t understand.

15

MR. WILKINS:

16

I

There is a two-fold answer tc

that. Justice O'Connor, and I think there is a very good

17 reason for not getting into that kind of detail at the
18 very outset.
19

On the initial level, this is a pattern cf

20 practice charge, as the prior decisions of this Court
21

recognized.

The pattern of practice charge is not fcased

22 on specific, individual kinds of occurrences.

It is

23 based on broad, general occurrences that take place over
24 a period of time.

So it is impossible, it really is

25 impossible to describe it beyond general terms.

QUESTION;

Sure, but what the Government in

these cases is doing is putting together a few simple

8 that in the notice of the charge?

9

ME. WILKINS;

As the Ninth Circuit noted in

10 the Dean Witter case, to require the Commission to get
11

intc providing a certain level of factual specificity,

12 or providing the statistics, would merely prompt, as
13 what has happened in this case, the Respondent would
14 come back and say,

"Eut my statistics show that **- Cur

15 bottomline statistics show that we are in conformity.
16 Ycur statistics aren’t adequate to commence this
17 investigation."

21

Going back to general notions of modus
pleading —
QUESTION;

The Court doesn't have to buy that,

obviously, as a requirement and the Court wouldn’t

22 necessarily have to turn this into a mini-trial.

But it

23 is just — I just have difficulty understanding why the
24 Government can’t disclose in the notice of the charge
25 what it really is basing this on.

MR. WILKIRSs

As Professor Moore stated in his

treatise on civil procedure» just as a general precept#

3 a requirement that facts be pleaded in a charge is
4 illusory and unsound.

It said that results in a battle

5 of the form of pleadings.
6

QUESTIONS

Sure, but we have the job of trying

7 to figure out why Congress included
8

this specific

language, and they had something in mind and we have to

9 determine what that something is.

It is just hard tc

10 know why the Government in these cases wouldn’t want —
11

Let me ask you another question.

Suppose the

12

notice of charge just said,

13

that Shell'has conducted discriminatory employment

14

practices in its United States operations since 1965."

"The Commission believes

15 Is that enough?
16

MR. WILKINSs

I am not certain.

I believe

17 that that probably would be insufficient, but here we
18 don’t have that sort of a charge.

They have been given

19

the circumstances.

20

excluded Blacks from designated categories, and women

21

from designated categories.

22

They have been told that they

the Title VII enforcement scheme proceeds, it will help

25

The charge under Section 706 does not commence

a formal enforcement action.

2

administrative investigation to determine whether there

It merely commences

3 is reasonable cause to believe that the allegations of
4 the charge are true.
5 found,

When such reasonable cause is

then the Commission attempts to conciliate the

6 employment dispute and settle.

Only if such efforts

7 fail, do you commence the formal enforcement action.
8 Therefore,

in light of the limited function that the

9 charge serves, requiring the Commission to come forth to
10 present its facts, present its proof at the very outset
11
12

is inappropriate.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wilkins, your answers assume

13 that this is kind of a judicially fashioned doctrine.
14 Professor Moore has said pleading of facts is illuscry
15 and, therefore, why shouldn’t the court strive to make
16

that rule a common sense one.

17 rule at all. Congress has said

But it is not a court
"circumstances.**

The

18 Federal Buies of Civil Procedure don’t say
19
20

"circumstances."
MR. WILKINS;

Yes, but. Justice Benquist,

21

Congress in 1964 said that a commissioner’s charge had

22

to state its facts, and the courts never required that

23 as requiring any sort of factual pleading.
24

QUESTION;

Do you think that those were sound

25 decisions, if Congress said

"facts," and the courts said

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

no facts

2
3

KF. WILKINS*

I believe, when you look at the

purpose and the overall Title VII enforcement scheme, I

4 believe they were indeed sound decisions.
5

QUESTIONS

In 1972 --

How would you rationalize those?

6 You say that Congress had said that facts must be
7

specified, and the courts said, no, you don’t have tc

8

specify facts, and you say that those are sound

9

decisions.

How would you explain that?
HE. WILKINS:

10

The uniform position that has

11

been taken since 1964, beginning in the early ’70s, in

12

the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Local 104 Sheetmetal

13

Workers, was that the purpose of the charge is merely to

14

commence an administrative investigation and inquiry to

15

determine whether there is reasonable cause.

16

that is at the very outset, it is merely a prelude to

17

the formal enforcement sorts of proceedings, it clearly

18 would
19

Because

be an anomaly to require the Commission to present

more facts, more factually specific material at the very

20 beginning of its administrative investigation than it
21

needs to present, indeed, to start a formal enforcement

22 action
23

in Federal District Court.
QUESTION:

In other words, Congress should

24 have provided the same provisions as the Rules of Civil
25 Procedure, and so we’ll assume that

it did.

That sounds

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

like about the reasoning of those cases.
MR. WILKINS;

2

The courts reasoned this way.

3 Section 707 in 1964 authorized the Attorney General to
4 bring a pattern of practice charge.

That section also

5 required the Attorney to set forth the facts upon which
8 it was based, and the courts uniformly construed that as
7 saying, we don't believe that Congress intended the
8 Commission to have to state all of the facts underlying
9 its — the Attorney General to state all the facts
10 underlying its cause of action at the very outset.
11

The

courts viewed that, well, then, if you are initiating

12 merely an administrative proceeding before that, we will
13 not impose a greater factual specificity burden at the
14 outset

than we do to file the formal enforcement

15 action .
16

QUESTION:

Sr. Wilkins.

17

MR. WILKINS;

18

QUESTION;

Yes.

Your position, of course, is that

19 the charge adequately puts Shell Company, in this case,
20 on fair notice as to what is being charged against it.
21

I have the appendix open at page 66, that is the

22 commencement of the first request for information.
23

MB. WILKINS;

24

QUESTION;

Yes.

Is that filed the same day the

25 charge is filed?

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
AM FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1
2

MR. WILKINS;

Yes.

I believe that that was

filed along with the --

3

QUESTION;

Does that suggest to you that the

4 EEOC either doesn't know the facts, the basic facts and
<
5 circum stances, or does it suggest that it has them and
6

is unwilling to disclose them?
MR. WILKINS;

7

It suggests to me, Justice

8 Powell, that the Commission has sufficient facts to have

9 reason to believe there is indeed a pattern of practice
10 of discrimination.
11

The purpose of the administrative

investigation is to determine what the actual cause cf

12 the pattern of practice that the Commission has.

13

QUESTION;

Is that first request for

14 information a standard form?
15

MR. WILKINS;

To the best of my knowledge

16 there are standard requests that are made.

They are

17 detailed to the particular needs of each case.

This is

18 not a standard request that is just churned case after
19 case.

There are elements that are asked in particular

20 cases.

21

QUESTION;

It goes on for 16 pages, doesn't

22 it?

23

MR. WILKINS;

24

QUESTION;

Yes, it does.

If you were counsel for the company

25 and received this, what would you reaction be?

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. WILKINS:

I

am certain that I would sit

2 down and recognize that I was going to be busy for the
3 next little while.
4

QUESTION:

Little while -- how many weeks?

5

MR. WILKINS:

6

QUESTION*

I have no way of knowing.

Hew many people would be required

7 in a major corporation to help you gather all of this
8 information which really undresses the corporation for
9 years.

Perhaps that is your purpose, but that is not

10 the way Government normally operates.
11

MR. WILKINS:

There’s a couple of things to

12 keep to tear in mind on this question.

First, the

13 Commission has offered to send in its staff to help
14 compile this information.

The Commission has also

15 offered to pay —
18

QUESTION:

They aren’t very helpful once in

17 there.
18

MR. WILKINS:

The Commission also has

19 procedures where it will help pay for the development of
20 this information.
21

The District Court in this case found

that this information sought was relevant to the

22 administrative investigation, and the compliance with
23 the request or with the subpoena was not unduly
24 burdensome.

The Court of Appeals didn’t disagree with

25 that.

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1
2

So while it may be extensive, and

I don't

disagree that it is extensive and that it would require

3 some substantial looking, the Commission has offered to
4 help in that looking, has offered to help pay for that
5 looking, and the lower court did not find it unduly

6 burdensome.
7

QUESTIONS

8 question.
9

I'll come back to my initial

If, indeed, the EEOC had enough information

to make a charge, why was it necessary to file 16 pages

10 of questions that asked every conceivable piece of
11

information about the employment practices of this

12

corporation over a period of years?

13
14
15

HE. WILKINS*

That is the exact purpose of the

conciliation and administrative litigation.
QUESTION*

They make a charge without knowing

16 the circumstances.
17

MR. WILKINS*

No, the purpose of the charge —

18 In this case, we had from our analysis of the EEG-1
19 reports that had been filed

by the Respondent, there

20 were indications, statistical indications that Shell had
21

engaged — had excluded Blacks and women from certain

22 job categories.
23

It is not clear from those EEC-1 reports at

24

the very outset exact-ly what happened, what's going cn,

25

what the underlying facts are.

Congress recognized that

16

this would be the case and it would be the case at the

3 difficult to prove.

They're

They're difficult to know --

4 exactly what has happened over a period of years.

5

QUESTIONS

Congress chose this very curious

6 language, if it really understood that the agency was
7 going

to file this sort of fishing expedition; don't you

8 think so?

You wouldn't be here if the language were

9 more specific, perhaps.

MS. WILKINS;

10
11

Well, Congress was aware in

1972

that the Commission needed more inforcement power and

12 needed more investigatory power.
13 empowered the Commission in

Indeed, they expressly

1572 to file these pattern

14 of practice charges because, as you read in the
15 legislative reports, the Commission has access tc the
16 statistical analyses, it has access to
17 information.

Because they knew that this information

18 would be somewhat sketchy at the outset, it provided for
19 this administrative investigation for the — It provided
20

the Commission with the authority to request to inspect

21

copy,

to subpoena information to find out out what is

22 going on.
23

The Commission only undertakes conciliation

MB. WILKINS;

QUESTION;

11

— in the word "circumstances."

MR. WILKINS;

10

Well, Congress —

That is right.

Let's look at

the legislative history of Section 706(b) for a moment.
QUESTION;

12

How about the language?

How about

13 the circumstances?

MR. WILKINS;

14

That is how you can understand

15 the language, that is why I want to look at the
16 history.
17

QUESTION;

I don't blame you.

18

MR. WILKINS;

In

*6b, Congress provided that

19 Commissioner's charges could only be filed when they set
20 forth

the facts on which they were based, and the

21 Commissioner had reasonable cause to believe that a
22 violation of the Act had occurred.

In 1972, as part of

23 legislation that was generally designed, as this Court
24 has recognized,

to increase the enforcement powers of

25 the Commission, Congress deleted these two requirements

15
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

and rendered Commissioner's charges subject to the exact

2

same requirements generally applicable to all charges#

3 that is, they must be in writing, under oath or
4 affirmation, and contain such information and be in
5 form as the Commission requires.

such

T think, that is a very

6 important factor that clearly was overlooked by the
7

court below.

8

QUESTION*

You would be in a much better

9 position if the provision that is at issue here had been
10 includ ed.
11
12

MR. WILKINS:

But the purpose of the

provision. Justice White, was, as I have said earlier,

13 merely tc provide that the Respondent had some notice of
14
15

that charge.
QUESTION*

So you think that the Commissioner,

16 in prescribing requirements which you mentioned a moment
17 ago, can say, we are not going to require circumstances
18 the way the other section does?
19

MR. WILKINS*

20

QUESTION:

21

Excuse me.

You say that the statute provides

that a charge shall be in such form as the Commission

22 may provide.
23

MR. WILKINS:

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

Do you think that the Commission

25 could provide saying that the form of charge shall be

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the following, but it need not include either date,
t

2 place, or circumstances?
3

MR. WILKINS*

4 provide that.

The charge could be -- cculd

The notice, then, would have to provide

5 the date, place, and circum stances.

Rut the Commission

8 certainly could choose to say that the charge will have
7 this information, and not necessarily include the date,
8 place,
9

and circumstances.
QUESTION:

Even though the notice of the

10 charge would have to be more specific, then?
11

MR. WILKINS:

No, the notice would have to

12 include the date, place, and circumstances.

It is

13 important to remember that the purpose of the notice
14 provision was as we said, merely to provide notice.

The

15 word "circumstances” does not in and of itself indicate
16 some sort of a congressional intent to set forth the
17 facts.

Indeed, Congress in 1972 deleted the requirement

18 that the Commissioner’s charge would set forth the
19 facts.
20
21

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Wilkins, also, didn’t the

*64 Act require the Commissioner's charge to be based on

22 reasonable cause?
23

MR. WILKINS:

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

In *72, in those amendments, that

25 requirement was dropped

But Congress tightened up in

It said, okay, you don't have to shew

4 reasonable cause, hut we do want you to put it under
5

oath, and set forth the date, place, and circumstances.

6

It just looks on the surface like they wanted to tighten

7

up the requirements of what you disclose as the basis

8

for the charge, even though they dropped the reasonable

9

cause requirement.

So I am not sure that the

10 legislative history argument is helping you.

11
12

HR. WILKINS;

the comments that were made and the comments in the

13 legislative report,
14

Justice O'Connor, if you look at

there is no indication whatsoever

that Congress felt that they were imposing any sort of a

15 new factual

pleading requirement or any kind of

16 disclosure requirement.

When they talked about notice, they talked

17

18 merely about informing the Respondent that a charge
19

was

actually pending against them, so that the Respondent

20 could begin to prepare its defense and gather the
21

information to sustain itself.

22

The charge in this case clearly performs those

23 functions.

They don't need more information to be able

24 to know that the charge is pending,
25

to be able to gather

their information, to be able to sustain themselves

during

the administrative investigation.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Wilkins, may I ask you a rather

3 fundamental question on- another point which your
4 argument has brought up.
5 to now,

In Part 3 of you brief — Up

you have basically been arguing the meaning cf

6 Section 706(b) of the statute.
7 you refer to the SOCAL case.

In Part 3 of your brief,
You argue, if I understand

8 you correctly, that the issue should not be reviewatle
9 at all

until after the proceeding comes to an end.

You

10 are relying, as I understand it, on the Administrative
11

Procedure Act.

12

I am wondering whether, with reference to the

13 SOCAL case,

you're contending that this is not agency

14 action at all, it is interlocutory agency action or that
15 it is agency action under the limited discretion cf the
16 agency?
17

Which of those three positions?
MR. WILKINSi

No, we are not really making any

18 of those assertions, if I understand what you are
19 getting at.
20
21
22

QUESTICNs

I just want to understand exactly

why your position is based on SOCAL.
MR. WILKINSs

Our position based on SOCAL is

23 that the issuance of an administrative complaint is
24 something that can always be challenged.

If the

25 Respondent in this case — there is always some sort of

23

2

believe —

3

whether it is reasonable cause, or reason to

QUESTION*

Rut is it always -- can it be

4 challenged in an independent proceeding in Federal Court

5 or only in the proceeding itself?
6
7

MR. WILKINS:

After the SOCAL case — After

the SCCAL decision, of course, they can’t bring an

8 initial proceeding under the Administrative Procedure
9

Act.

In this case, the only reason this question arose

10 is because there is a subpoena enforcement action, and
11

they're still trying to make the same sort of an

12 argument, that somehcv this charge was improperly
13

issued.

The Government’s response is that the rationale

14 of the SCCAL case applied across the beard at this
15 point.
18

This has no determinative requirement.
QUESTION*

Is it your position that in

17 subpoena enforcement proceeding, they have no right
18

test the sufficiency of the charge?
HR. WILKINS:

19

The sufficiency of the charge is

20 to be determined in the administrative proceeding.
21

QUESTION:

You should have won on motion to

dismiss without even looking at the language of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. WILLIAMS, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8

MR. WILLIAMS;

9 please the Court.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

With the Court's permission.

10

I believe the questions that the Court has

11

asked this morning focus on the narrow issue that is

12 presented in this case, and

that is what Congress meant

13 when it specified in Section 706(b)
14 in a Title VII
15 place,

that the Respondent

proceeding must be notified of the date,

and circumstances of the violations alleged in

16 the charge.

The Commission is here arguing for an

17

18 interpretation which in our view would effectively read
19 the words "date, place, and circumstances" out of the
20 text of

21

the statute.

They maintain that the only notice

the Commission is required to give to a Respondent is

22 notice of the fact that a charge is pending against it.

23 At no time, at least until this morning, has the
24 Commission acknowledged any obligation to provide
25 anything more than bare notice of the existence,

of the

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

pendency of the charge.

2

Perhaps counsel’s qualified concession in

3 answer to Justice O'Connor's question may indicate that
4 there may be some need to provide something more than

5 bare notice of existence, but whether it actually
6 requires that a date, a place, or any circumstances at
7 all be set forth has never been clarified from the
8 Commission standpoint.
9

QUESTIONS

Whether that is so or not, I

10 understand to say that any requirement like that is
11

satisfied by the notice that was given in this case, and

12 he says that saying there was discrimination in these
13 particular categories is enough of a notice of the
14

"circumstances."

HR. WILLIAMS:

In an instance such as this,

12 is based, at least in part, on statistics, the general
13 nature of the statistical data relied on —

necessarily is a statistical charge; is that it?
MR. WILLIAMS;

Well frankly, of course, we are

17 at a disadvantage because we don't know for sure what
18 this charge was based on.

The Government has some

19 forward belatedly and made some assertions about what
20

the charge was based on, but because the charge itself

21

or the notice did not include any explication, we don't

22

really knew.

23

But assuming that their representations are

24 correct, and that this charge was based on statistical
25 compilations, comparisons between internal data that the

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

company had provided to the EECC with standard data

2

referring to availability in the labor market/ I think

3

what the Eighth Circuit was indicating is the fact that

4 those data were used, the general nature of the data,
5

including dates that would enable the Respondent to

6

identify what the Commission was basing this charge on,

7 that is all that seems to be required.
8

The Court also indicated that in the instance

9 where there is an individual charge that forms the basis
10

for the Commissioner's charge that the identity of the

11

individual need not be disclosed, but that the fact that

12 it is based on an individual charge, coupled with some

13

indication of the position held by that individual,

14 ought to be provided.
15

QUESTION*

Suppose, in addition to actually

16 furnishing you notice, giving circumstances some
17 meaning, would also assure that the Commissioner
18 actually had facts on which

19 based on.

then really the only complaint that a Respondent

ME. WILLIAMS;

18

We are not aware of any. Your

19 Honor .
20

I would like to address the legislative

21

history briefly in response to some of the arguments

22

that have been made.

23

First, the fact is, there is nothing in this

24 legislative history that bears directly on the intended
25 meaning cf the words "date,

place, and circumstances."

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

We take that as a point in cur favor because it means

2 there is no basis for giving those words anything other
3 than their ordinary, everyday meaning.

Secondly, what is clear from the legislative

4

5 history is that Congress was not willing to give this
6 Commission completely unbridled, roving investigative
7 powers.
8

They set this up as a charged based agency,

rather than an agency with a self-initiating

9 investigative process like the FTC, and other agencies.

To the extent that they gave Commission

10
11

members authority to file charges, Congress took pains

12 to see that that authority would not lead to abuse, an!
13

particularly to fishing expeditions.

14

1964 Act required reasonable cause before a Commissioner

15 could file a charge.

That is why the

The concern about fishing

16 expeditions was very explicit in the 1964 legislative
17 history.
18

That same basic concern is reflected again in

19 the compromise that was reached in the Conference
20 Committee on the 1972 amendments with regard to

21

the

authority for the requirements for issuance of

22 commissioner’s charges.

23

The Senate till would have cut back on the

24 authority for commissioner's charges to allow their use
25 only where there was an individual claiming to be

36

aggrieved, who wished to be anonymous

2

added the oath requirement and added the new notice

The Senate bill

3 language requiring notice of date, place, and
4 circum stances.
5
6

In conference, the Senate receded with respect
to the provision that there needed to be an individual

7 claiming to be aggrieved who didn't wish to come
8 forward, but the Senate prevailed with respect to the
9

addition of the oath and the notice requirement.
Given this history, we think that it is simply

10
11

not accurate to argue, as the Government does, that the

12

*72 amendments simply eliminated any and all factual

13

pleading requirements or any requirement to articulate

14

the basis for a charge.

to every Respondent before a Title VII investigation can

22 proceed.

23

We also think that it is significant that when

24 the Attorney General's authority to bring pattern of
25 practice cases under Section 707 of the statute was

36
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

transferred tc the Commission after the '72 amendments,

2 that authority was also made subject to the requirements
3

that there be a valid charge under oath, and supported

4

by notice.

5

that authority was in the hands of the Attorney

6 General.

Those requirements had not teen present when

We think the fact that they were added when

7 the authority passed to the

Commission again illustrates

8 the unwillingness of Congress to give this Commission
9

completely self-initiating investigative powers.
Given this background, we submit that insofar

10
11

as commissioner's charges can be used tc initiate

12 investigations without an independent request from an
3 outside party, that the formal oath and notice
4

requirements that Congress imposed must be enforced

5 strictly — we are not sayino hypertechnically,

but

6

literally — in order to avoid conflict with the reasons

7

why Congress set this up a charge based investigative

8

process .

9

We also believe, in light of the legislative

20 history and the context of these provisions in the
21

statute, that the oath and notice requirements ought to

22

be read as interrelated.

If a charge didn't have to

23 contain any facts or any specific indication of what it
24

is based on, the oath would become practically

25 oiea nin gless.

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

We don’t think Congress intended that, we
think they perceived this as a meaningful requirement.

3 Given

the statutory context, it seems clear that

4 Congress contemplated that the information that would
5 have to be in the notice would come from the charge.
6 Therefore, there would be a

7

statement under oath setting

forth these basic details.
The Commission has stressed that the statute

8

9 gives it the authority to specify the form and content
10 of charges.

But, Your Honors, that does not empower the

11

Commission to repeal the basic statutory requirements

12

pertaining to notice, those elements have to be

13

present.

As long as they’re satisfied, sure, the

14 Commission can require as much or as little other
15 information in whatever form it sees fit.
16

The Commission has also argued that its

17 regulations have consistently provided that a charge is
18 sufficient if identifies the parties and generally
19 describes the action or practice complained of.

The

20 fact is, the regulations relied on by the Commission for
21

that point, it’s Section 1601.12(b) of the current

22 regulations, was not adopted until

23

1978.

That regulation supplanted the earlier

24 regulation,

1601.11(b), which said that a charge would

25 be "deemed filed if it identified the parties, and

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

generally described the action or practice complained

2 of."

Both versions then provide that a charge, after

3 being filed, can be amended

to correct technical defects

4 of omissions.
5

The difference is that the current regulation

6 provides that such a charge is sufficient without being
7 amended, whereas the earlier version prior to 1978
8 required only that the charge be — provided only that

9 such a charge would be deemed filed.
10
11

Finally, with regard to the Commission’s
regulations, we think the Court should be particularly

12 cautious about deferring

to the Commission's standards

13 for a valid charge insofar as they are applied to the
14 Commission’s own members.
15
16

It may be necessary at times to apply formal
requirements leniently in order to avoid injustice to

17 individuals who may not be sophisticated in the
18 procedures.

But we see no reason why the Commission

19 shouldn’t hold its own members to a

standard that at

20 least fully satisfies the requirements of the statute.
21

We don’t think that there is anything burdensome or

22 disruptive about requiring the Commission to do that.
23

No one is arguing here that the Commission has

24

to disclose its entire investigative file, all the facts

25 in its possession, that is certainly not what the Eighth

39

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Circuit required.

2

those courts — the ether circuits that have ruled in

3

such a

4

requirement of the statute.

5

there is a middle ground here.

We feel that that is the fallacy of

way as not to give effect to the circumstances
They failed to see that
There need not be a

6 choice between a strict factual -- detailed factual
7

pleading requirement on the one hand, and no standard at

8 all on
9

the other.
We think that as a matter of policy, early

10 disclosure of the basic facts that the Commission relied

on in deciding to file a charge would help to focus the
12 issues; would lay a better groundwork for conciliation;
3

would assist both the Commission, district offices, and

4

the Respondent in identifying facts and data that might

5

be relevant; would help to promote early voluntary

6 compliance —

QUESTIONi

7

As a matter of policy, of course,

8

you can make some very strong arguments the other way.

9

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have worked pretty

20 well.

21

They pretty well limited fact requirement almost

out of existence in its notice pleadino.

It seems tc me

22 that your strongest case is based on the statute,
23 not on
24
25

and

what be the best policy for Congress to choose.
HR. WILLIAMS;

I would agree that the

principal argument is based on the statute.

I do think.

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

though , Your Honor, that in a statute such as this,

2 which places such heavy emphasis on voluntary compliance
3 and conciliation, it is relevant to consider the impact
4 that the Commission’s stonewall approach of not

5 disclosing anything has on the relationships between the
6 parties at the early stage.
If the Respondent knows basically what the

7

8 Commission is basing its case on, he may be able in many

9 cases to come forward with an explanation or some
10 exculpatory data at the very outset of the investigation
11

that will obviate the need for this kind of extremely

12 time-consuming, and expensive probing into every aspect

13 of its employment practices.
14 policy

So we think that that

consideration is simply — is consistent with the

15 literal interpretation of the statute.

I haven’s said much to this point about the

16

17 date requirement, Your Honors.

Obviously, the date of

18 an alleged violation is somewhat more difficult to spell
19 out in

a case involving a continuing practice, or an

20 alleged continuing

21
22

practice of discrimination, than it

is in an individual discharge situation.
But we still think that a fair construction of

23 Section 706(b) requires something more specific than a
24 mere reference to the effective date of the act,
25 particularly where there is nothing else recited in the

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

charge that would indicate any basis for the selection

2

of that date.

3

In other words, the date and circumstances

4 notifications may compliment one another.
5

The

circumstances when properly set forth should indicate

6 why the date chosen is a good faith estimate of the
7

probable time periods of the violations.

A date that

8 would be insufficient standing alone, might be
9 sufficient in the context of a recitation of
10 circum stances.
11

In the worst offender situation that the

12 Government cites, it should

be relatively easy to set

13 forth circumstances that would support a starting date
14 going all the way back to the beginning of the Act.

In

15 other situations, the dates may have to be more specific
16 in order to make it clear what the circumstances are
17 that are being referred to.

Without something more than

18 a mere insertion of the July 2nd, 1965, date is no more
19 -- is really no more informative than a citation to the
20

21

Act itself.
In summary, let me just emphasize again that

22 this is a straightforward case of statutory

23 construction.

To uphold the Commission's construction

24 is to read the statute as if the words "date, place and
25 circumstances" were not there.

To affirm the decision

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

below is to give those words their ordinary meaning.

2 This does not require a choice between a hypertechnical
3 pleading standard or no standard at all.
4

We think the

Eighth Circuit properly perceived a middle ground.

5

We do believe, though. Your Honors, that since

6 the case is here that some further clarification of what
7

the terms "date and circumstances" mean in the context

8 of a systemic discrimination case, based primarily on
9 statistics,

might be helpful.

We suggested some fairly

10 minimal factors in our brief at Footnote 38 that we
11

think should be required in a case such as this.
