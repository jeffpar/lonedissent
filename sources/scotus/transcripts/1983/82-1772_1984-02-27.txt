ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
This case presents questions of fundamental

11

importance to the orderly administration and

12

adjudication c-f the millions of claims that are filed

13

under the Social Security Act each year.

14

enacted a special self-contained procedure for the

15

administrative and judicial review of Social Security

16

claims, and it has assigned to the Secretary of Health

17

and Human Services the responsibility for prescribing

18

the administrative steps in that process that must be

19

pursued before a claimaint seeks judicial review.

20

Congress has

The Court of Appeals in this case, however,

21

excused the respondents from exhausting the

22

administrative procedures the Secretary has prescribed

23

befcre they sought judicial review within the special

24

statutory procedure that Congress has enacted, and in

25

addition, the Court of

Appeals held that respondents

■3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

could challenge the Secretary's interlccutcry decisions

2

denying their claims outside of that special procedure

3

by bringing a separate action under the general grants

4

of subject matter jurisdiction in Sections 1331

5

of the Judicial Code.

6

and

1361

We have sought review in this case because the

7

Court of Appeals'

decision is flatly inconsistent, in

8

cur view, with this Court's prior decisions in

9

Weinberger versus Salfi and later cases with attached

10

legislative history and consistent administrative

11

implementation of the Act.

12

If the Court of Appeals' interpretation were

13

affirmed by this Court, the interlocutory and pieceireal

14

review of the Court cf Appeals has permitted would

15

substantially disrupt the administrative and judicial

16

review of Social Security claims.

17

There is a pressing need in this area

18

involving many claims for the Secretary and the courts

19

to have clear rules that can be easily and

20

applied in all cases without the need to litigate in

21

particular cases their applicability,

22

Secretary and Congress have established for this purpose

23

are fair and reasonable.

24
25

Before stating the facts of

uniformly

and the rules the

this case, I would

like tc briefly outline those procedures that Congress

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.t N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

and the Secretary have prescribed.

The basic statutory

2

framework is simple and straightforward.

3

contained in Section 2C5 of the Act, which was enacted

4

in

5

42.

It is

1939, and is now codified in Section 405 of Title

Section 405(b) directs the Secretary to make

6
7

findings and decisions on claims for benefits under the

8

Act.

9

is dissatisfied with the Secretary's initial

Section 405(b) then provides that if the claimant

10

determination, the Secretary must afford him an

11

opportunity for a hearing on the claim.

12

QUESTION:

13

before the surgery?

Kr. Kneedler, can the claim be made

NR. KNEEDLER:

14

No, under the Nedicare program,

15

as under most insurance programs, the claimant files a

16

claim

17

that have already teen rendered.

18

for payment which can be made only for services

QUESTION:

Then how is it possible for someone

19

whc wants the surgery performed to get a determination

20

about reimbursement before having the surgery?

21

NR. ^NEEDIER:

The Act does net provide for

22

this sort of procedure.

The administrative procedure

23

that Congress has established, particularly Section

24

405(b), refers to determinations and hearings on

25

applications or determining the rights of people whc

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

have applied for payment under the Act, and a person

2

wouldn't even have a right to payment until he applied

3

for benefits after having the surgery.

4

QUESTION;

Well, under your view, is there any

5

way at all that a person could get that kind of

6

determination --

7

IIP. KNEEDIER;

Well, the person could request,

8

I suppose, the Secretary to perhaps offer advice, but

9

for part of the reasons, I suppose, that were developed

10

in the preceding case for one of the intermediaries to

11

suagost the particular service might be covered before

12

the person has even had the surgery might create

13

problems, and ordinarily the intermediary would decline

14

to do that.

15

QUESTION;

Well, for someone looking at

16

elective surgery, something that isn’t going to done no

17

matter what, and of modest means, it dees put them in a

18

difficult position, doesn’t it?

19

*R. kNEEEIER;

Well, it might.

In the typical

20

Kedicare claim situation, the rules are fairly well

21

established, and by reference to what private insurance

22

carriers do, but even quite aside from whether — from

23

any policy of general applicability the Secretary has,

24

in any individual case, surgery can only be paid for if

25

it is reasonable and necessary, and that is a

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

determination that could net be made until after the

2

individual had the surgery in any event.

3

QUESTION;

Oh, well --

4

QUESTION;

Of course, this is Hr. Ringer's

5

position, the one that Justice O'Connor refers to, isn’t

6

it?

Nr. Ringer's.
HR. KNEEELEE;

That he is entitled to review

now ?
QUESTION;

9

No, that he -- he is in a position

10

where he wants this procedure, but can't afford to pay

11

for it, and how does he find out?

12

MR. XNEEDLER;

Well, as I say, there is no

13

established procedure for that.

14

case,

15

-- or virtually all cf this particular surgery is

16

adjudicating claims on -- as the representative for

17

other claimants who have had the surgery, sc in this

18

particular instance, that doesn't present a problem,

19

because the question of the coverages will be litigated

20

anyway .

21

As it turns out in this

the physician who is responsible for most of the

As I was saying,

the Act in Section 405(b)

22

provides for administrative hearings, and then also

23

authorizes the Secretary to conduct such other

24

proceedings as are necessary to determine individual

25

claims, and immediately after Section 4C5 was enacted in

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

1939,

the Secretary established a four-level procedure

2

for administrative review cf claims, an initial

3

determination, a reconsideration, the hearing required

4

by the Act, and Appeals Council review.
Then the special provision for judicial review

5

6

is contained in Section 405(g), which provides for

7

review only cf the final decision cf the Secretary, and

8

the Secretary's regulations since 1940 have made clear

9

that the final decision subject to judicial review is

10

that rendered after the Appeals Council has looked at

11

the ca se.
And then, to make clear that all challenges tc

12

13

decisions on Social Security claims are channeled

14

through Section 405(g), Section 405(h) provides that no

15

decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed in any other

16

manner except -- by a tribunal in any other manner

17

except under 405(g), ar.d Section 405(h) says that no

18

action

19

j urisdicticn.

20

may be brought under any of the general grants of

QUESTION;

hr. Kneedler, as tc surgery

21

performed after the Secretary's new regulation, and

22

under the regulation it provides that this particular

23

procedure would never be reimbursed, approved for

24

reimbursement, why doesn’t it fall under the bathews

25

somewhat unique, and that is where the claimant is

challenging the constitutionality of the Act itself.

Well,

those cases there were special factors present.

The

10

claimant conceded that there were no facts in dispute.

11

The claimant conceded that the Secretary’s

12

interpretation cf the statute -- he didn't quarrel with

13

the Secretary's interpretation of the statute.

14

other issues were resolved except for the

15

constitutionality cf the Act of Congress, which was

beyond

And even then the Court held in Salfi that

18

just because a court might believe that exhaustion cf

19

remedies would be futile does not furnish a basis for

20

the court to excuse exhaustion.

21

though, in Salfi was that the Secretary's failure to

22

contest the allegations of exhaustion would be deemed a

23

waiver cf exhaustion in the circumstances of that case.

What the Court held.

That was the rationale explicitly that the
Court adopted in Diaz.

The only ground that the Secretary objected to

QUESTION;

Dc you ask us to modify Diaz today?

13

NR. KNEEDLEE :

Dc we ask -- No, we do not.

14

Diaz is confined, as I said, to a situation involving

15

constitutional claims.

16

perhaps it would be useful to point cut the contrasts.

17

This case is much different, and

It can’t be said here that there is no dispute

18

over the facts of the claims for benefits.

Respondents

19

vigorously contest the Secretary's view as to whether

20

this particular procedure is safe and effective.

21

is also a dispute ever the meaning, interpretation, and

22

application of the statute, unlike in Salfi and Diaz,

23

because here the respondents contend that the Secretary

24

has misconstrued, misapplied the statute.

25

Diaz that wasn't the case.

respondents, the ruling doesn't apply to them.
QUESTION;

11

12

First,

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.

operations before hut who have not had their cases ruled

With respect to the three who

20

were decided before, the formal ruling itself said that

21

22

before

the effective date of the ruling.
QUESTION;

23
24

Sc the Secretary does not take the

position that the ruling applies to them.
MR. KNEEDLER;

That's correct, and even as to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

persons who had the surgery after the effective date of

2

the ruling, the respondents argued in the administrative

3

proceedings, which are still ongoing, that the ruling

4

should not apply even to them.

5

argument that the particular regulation that binds the

6

Appeals Council and the A1J's to rulings issued by the

7

Health Care Financing Administration doesn’t apply to

8

Medicare cases.

There is a technical

And sc that argument was made.

9

So that’s precisely the sort cf reason why,

10

even though there’s a regulation that has been issued

11

that says a particular sort cf service is net covered,

12

that there should be exhaustion, because it will be up

13

to the Appeals Council and the -- and before that the

14

ALJ to determine whether the regulation actually applies

15

to these claimants.

16

And it is also important, I think, to

17

recognize that a ruling cn the merits or an issue

18

involved in the merits is really just one aspect of a

19

claim for benefits.

20

of a claim, just as in the judicial determination cf a

21

lawsuit, a decision is reviewed only after final

22

judgment which resolves all of the issues in the claim.

23

In the administrative adjudication

Here, respondents are challenging just ore

24

ruling or one regulation, a policy.

There are other

25

issues involved in a claim, whether the person is

ME. KHEEDIER :

7

Why is it anything tut

Well, first of all. Justice

8

O’Connor, even if it were futile, that would not be a

9

basis

for excusing exhaustion.

This Court made

10

explicitly clear, stated several times in Salfi that the

11

Court’s view that exhaustion might te futile would net

12

be sufficient to excuse exhaustion.

13

And in Salfi itself, the statute barred the

recovery, and precisely this argument cculd have teen

made,

that it was not necessary.

9

If it is totally futile, why should

10

the court wait for the Secretary to say -- What is the

Even 1331.

21

MR. KNEEDLER;

Right.

They wouldn't have

22

standing to challenge the regulation as such, but the

23

Court cf Appeals also apparently viewed the regulation

24

as some sort cf evidence that the Secretary had made up

25

her mind as to whether a particular type of surgery

ALDERSON REPORTINQ COMPANY, INC.

2

argue that even if the regulation doesn't technically

3

apply to them, the Secretary has expressed a view cn

4

this through the issuance of this regulation that will

5

indicate that exhaustion is futile.
That is ctvicusly not correct either, because

the issue is litigated on the merits before the ALJ.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, Eldridge was a claim,

though, that was entirely collateral to the merits.

15

wasn't that it was -- It wasn't simply that it was

16

procedural, because under, for instance, under the

8

Why doesn't that reasoning apply to

MB. KNEEDLERi

that one can't even get into the Section 405 procedure,

If the claimant files a request for an ALJ hearing, and

HR. HARKINS;

1

2

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

3

It is respondents' position here that there

4

are only two issues which the Court needs to address.

5

The first is that the Secretary is telling this Court

6

that she has the unfettered discretion to determine when

7

judicial review is available under Section ^05,

9

that this Court cannot lock behind a motion to dismiss

The second question, which I will come back to

12

after addressing the first, is a question that the

13

Secretary completely ignores, and that is the one cf how

14

are Medicare beneficiaries who are too poor to advance

15

the cost of treatment and obtain the surgery ever able

16

to file a claim to exhaust their administrative remedies

HR. HARKINS*

1

First of all, Hr. Chief Justice,

2

we telieve that that is a question which has already

3

been resolved by the Secretary's Appeals Council and by

4

her Administrative law Judges, and that is something

5

that has not been presented to the District Court, and

6

which we frankly believe the District Court should net

7

have to address in this case.
There is some disagreement, however, with

8
9

respect to the utility cf the treatment.

However, as we

10

point out in cur brief, the Appeals Council found that

11

it was reasonable and necessary in the cases before it,

12

and also found that there are segments of the medical

13

community which do prescribe this treatment and are in

14

fact of support of it.

15

With respect to the first issue --

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

would suggest that the only way that the Court can

It is a jurisdictional question.

I don’t think so.

I think that

the thing that makes this case different is that the

to go back and we have tc lock at the purposes of the

Any number of courts have held that the

2
3

purpose of the Act was to alleviate the burden that

4

healt care imposes on the elderly and on the sick, cn

5

those who are least able to afford it.

happening here is that the Secretary is interpreting 405

7

in a way that establishes a financial prerequisite tc

claim,

What is

and then to exhaust the remedies.

10

And I think that it is totally inconsistent

11

with Congress's purposes in establishing the Medicare

12

program that the Secretary would be able to impose a

13

financial requirement to get into the system cn these

14

who are unable to feet the till up front.

15

seems to me, precisely what Congress intended tc avoid,

16

was to avoid the burden that health care costs impese on

17

these very individuals.

That is, it

And I think that beyond that, if you interpret

18
19

405 to

preclude people like Freeman Finger from getting

MR. HARKINS;

5

But in this instance, Justice

6

Rehnquist, I realize that poverty itself is not an

7

invidious basis of discrimination, but I think that the

8

Court should interpret 405 in a fashion that avoids the

need tc address that constitutional guest ion.
QUESTION;

10

But in view of the fact that

11

poverty is net an invidious classification, what

12

substantial constitutional question would there be?
MR. HARKINS;

13

I think that the question is one

14

of denying access to the system, denying access to both

MR. HARKINS;

Because there are two subclasses

and therefore not filed a claim.

includes people who have had the treatment and have

MR. HARKINS;

10

That is correct.

you could amend and do all of that, couldn’t you?

Yes, we could, and I suspect

that we would be back here in short order, sir.

9
10

If we just vacated, sent it tack,

Well,

why are we spinning our

wheels right now?
MR. HARKINS*

11

Because, as I say,

I don’t think

12

that the underlying issues are affected by the ruling,

13

except

14

that the ruling exacerbates the situation.
QUESTION*

Well, why upset a clear ruling cf

15

the Court just to meet a situation that can be corrected

16

without a decision of this Court on a point that is not

17

before the Court?

18

MR. HARKINS;

The only answer I can give you,

19

Justice Marshall, is that we are satisfied with the

20

Ninth Circuit's ruling at this point, and we don’t think

21

that amendment, even if it were necessary, would present

any problem.

to you, pursuing some of the earlier questions.

There

has been a statutory or — I think it's a statutory

6

allowance that people get a tax cut if they insulate

7

their hemes.

8

giving a tax credit if people put air bags in their cars

9

pending the time when it would be compulsory, if ever.

10

Suppose someone comes into the IRS and says,

There is legislation being discussed about

11

am old and I am poor, and I want to put an airbag in my

12

car but I can’t afford to dc it unless you absolutely

13

assure me that I will get a tax credit for it.

14

think they could insist on that?

15

ME. HAEKINS*

I

Do you

I must confess, in all the

16

things that we talked about in preparing for argument,

17

that is one that hadn’t come up, but I think that the

18

answer tc that is, first of all, that this case is

19

different because it is net a question where someone is

20

asking for an absolute assurance that coverage will be

21

availa ble.
It is a situation in which the Secretary has

22
23

already provided absolute assurance that coverage is not

24

available.

25

And secondly, when you get beyond that,

review, and in this instance I don't think that there is

4

any question on the facts that the decision is final for

5

purposes of judicial review.

6

that the question then becomes one of, on the

I think that when you look at the facts of

7

this case, as the Ccurt did in Salfi and in Eldridge and

8

in Eiaz, that there is absolutely no room for

9

disagreement on that.

10

QUESTION;

Let's look at the facts of these

11

particular named parties for a minute.

Now, Finger is

12

the one who has not had the operation.

Is that right?

13

ME. HARKINS;

14

QUESTION;

15

That’s correct.

The other three had the operation,

and are now in the administrative process.

16

MR. HARKINS;

17

QUESTION;

That’s correct.

And it's agreed that the

18

Secretary's regulation doesn’t govern the claim of any

19

one of those three.

20

MR. HARKINS;

21

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

So unless you are right about

22

Ringer having kind cf a constitutional right to get an

23

an administrative declaratory judgment, none cf these

24

four parties really have standing to challenge the

25

Secretary’s regulation as she would have it applied.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. HARKINS

1

In that instance, those

2

individuals are still covered hy the policy that the

3

Secretary had issued, the informal policy that was in

4

place prior to the effective date of the ruling.

5

if in fact it is the case that those individuals don't

6

have standing to challenge the ruling, again, I would

7

suggest that that is a situation that can easily he

8

cured by amendment.

9

QUESTION;

Now,

Well, tut perhaps before the Ninth

10

Circuit or this Court should have to pass on the

11

question, we ought to have a complaint that actually

12

raises

13

-- it seems to me part of your argument for challenging

14

the Secretary's regulation is that it is kind of an

15

ironclad, no holds barred type of thing.

16

this kind of suit, whatever you do.

informal policy would have less of those manifestations

18

than an actual regulation.

MR. HARKINS;

You lose in

I would think an

As a matter of fact, Justice

20

Rehnquist, it did not, because the individuals that were

21

involved in the class of these who had filed the claims

22

were denied initially and upon reconsideration based

23

solely on the policy.

24
25

They were then put in a position of
litigating, and up until the time the lawsuit was filed,

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62B-9300

1

what we had was a situation that these who litigated got

2

benefits and these who did not litigate did not get

3

benefits, and the award of benefits was conditioned not

4

upon the individual plaintiff's treatment or upon their

5

condition, tut upon whether they survived long enough to

6

litigate, whether they had the resources and the desire

7

to litigate.

HR. HARKINS;

I would think that on judicial

review, that he could do exactly that, insofar as he is

11

representative of named individuals in the

12

administrative proceeding.

13

QUESTION;

Hr. Harkins, I thought Mr. Kneedler

14

suggested that even the three who had the operation

15

before the regulation came out might have standing,

16

technical standing, Article 3 standing to challenge the

17

validity of the regulation because it would affect

18

nevertheless the disposition of their cases.

19

MR. HARKINS;

20

QUESTION;

21
22

Well, I think in fact —

It would make ALJ's much more

likely to turn them down.
fcR. HARKINS;

In fact, that is exactly what

23

happened here, because the only claimants who have been

24

denied coverage in front of an ALJ were those who had

25

not had the treatment and the AIJ hearing occurred after

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the ruling was issued,

2

would suggest that these claimants were biased by that

ruling .

QUESTIONS

At least that's a claim enough to

give you technical standing, you suggest,

6

MR. HARKINS;

7

QUESTION;

8
9

and it certainly -- the facts

in this case.

I would think so.

In which event then we have tc

reach these ether questions, ycu are arguing.
QUESTION;

I must confess I am still puzzled

10

about why the ruling doesn't apply to pending cases.

11

know Mr. Kneedler agreed — said it did not apply, but

12

if I read ycur stipulation, it says in so many werds

13

that this particular operation is excluded from Medicare

14

coverage under the authority of Section 1862(a)(1).

15

Isn't that an interpretation of the statute by the

16

Secretary that should be binding on the ALJ's even with

17

respect to earlier filed claims?

18

on the ALJ's?

19

MR. HARKINS;

I

Why isn’t that binding

The situation that had existed

20

prior to the time that the ruling was published was that

21

there was a manual provision which provided exactly the

22

same thing as the stipulation ycu just read.

23
24
25

QUESTION;

Well, how could the ALJ's deny —

how could they refuse to follow that?
MR. HARKJNS;

The ALJ's, I think, were

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

persuaded on looking at the facts of the individual

2

cases that they should not follow it, that they gave

3

perhaps weight to that policy, but that given the

4

results of the treatment, and listening to the testimony

5

of the

6

individuals involved, that they could net fellow

Tc be honest with you, I cannot point a finger

7
8

at a specific provision that says that the ALJ's were

9

not bound by that.

10

However, the ALJ's took the position

that the informal policy was net binding.
QUESTION;

11

Well, this is surely not an

12

informal policy, where there is a formal ruling that

13

this is not covered within the — not reasonable within

14

the meaning of the Act.

15

don't know why that wouldn’t apply to a claim filed in

16

advance as well as one filed later.

states that it was to have prospective effect only.

18

No, Justice O'Connor.

There

19

have been ten different Administrative law Judges, 26

20

proceedings, and they have occurred all over the

21

countr y.
I think if I could leave the Court with one

22
23

point,

I think that point would be that in the District

24

Court,

in the Court of Appeals, and in this Court, the

25

Secretary has stated over and ever again that the intent

and the effect of that ruling is to bind the

2

Administrative Law Judges and the Appeals Council and tc

3

absolutely prohibit reimbursement for this treatment.
I think that that fact brings this case

4
5

squarely within this Court's holdings in Salfi, in

6

Eldridge, and in Diaz, and as much as the Secretary

7

wants tc ignore the rulings in these cases and tc quete

8

language from those cases, those decisions found

9

jurisdiction at least as far as the named plaintiffs

10

were concerned.
Each of those cases found jurisdiction under

11

12

Section 405 despite the fact that the plaintiffs had not

13

completely exhausted the administrative process.

14

fact,

15

satisfied the finality requirements imposed by the

16

Secretary's regulations.

17

was a concession that there had not been complete

18

exhaus tion .

19

Salfi points out that the named

plaintiffs had not

More than that, each of those cases found

20

jurisdiction under Section 405 despite the fact that the

21

Secretary had moved to dismiss in each case for failure

22

tc exhaust administrative remedies.

Eldridge, the Court notes that the Secretary made cut

24

the same argument that she makes here,

25

is bound by her determination on finality.

Indeed, in

that this Court

And the Court answered that very simply;

1

We

2

disagree; and proceeded to look to the merits of the

3

finality question.

4

that exhaustion was unnecessary because the Secretary

5

had taken a conclusive position on the issue.

6

Eldridge, it was as a result of a statutory provision —

7

excuse me -- as a result of the impact of the

8

Secretary's regulation.

9

the result of a statutory provision.

It suggested in each of those cases

In

In the other two cases# it was

But that is precisely the situation that we

10
11

have here.

Diaz in particular supports the result of

12

the Ninth Circuit, because the Secretary's counsel in

13

colloquy with the District Court there as far as one

14

plaintiff is concerned insisted that the decision --

15

that benefits could not be awarded tc that plaintiff.
And I think that while the Secretary never

16
17

comes right cut in saying it, what she’s telling you is

18

that she wants you to overrule Salfi, Eldridge, and

19

Diaz.

20

cannot do precisely what it did in each of these three

21

cases,

22

or a statement that further exhaustion is required.

She is actually asking this Court to hold that it

that you cannot look behind a motion to dismiss,

But I think there is more to it than that,

23
24

because when you see the big picture, what the

25

Secretary,

I think, is really saying is that this Court

53

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

is bound by her determination cn finality but that she

2

can’t be bound by the decisions of the Administrative

3

Law Judges within their jurisdiction cr by the decisions

4

of the Federal Court.
I think that when you put this in perspective,

5

6

the Secretary is asking for a license to continue tc

7

ignore decisions even within the jurisdiction in which

8

those decisions were rendered.

several things.

This Court could net have teen clearer in Salfi that a

court cannot substitute its judgment for whether

exhaustion of the administrative remedies would be

8

futile for that of the Secretary.
If the prohibition in the 1980 Heckler ruling

That is the very reason why exhaustion of
