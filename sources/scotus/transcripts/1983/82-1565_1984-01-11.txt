CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. EASTERBROOK, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

5

MR. EASTERBRCOK;

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court;
The statute at issue in this case requires

Mr. Easterbrook, I

wholesalers of liquor to pay a tax of 2C percent on

10

their wholesale price.

11

include all alcoholic beverages, but it exempts, at

12

least from 1971 to 1981, fruit wine, ckolehao, made in

13

Hawaii.

14

at a 2C percent rate, while most liquor made in Hawaii

15

was not taxed.

17

The statute defines liquor to

Thus, all products from out of state are taxed

The difference can be many dollars per

The challenge we press here is based on the

18

Commerce Clause, the Import-Export Clause, and the Equal

19

Protection Clause, because the principles underlying

20

those clauses are very similar as applied to

differential taxation of interstate transactions.

will focus on the Commerce Claus at oral argument.

QUESTION;

Mr. Easterbrook, would your client

have had any complaint if the exceptions for the

in the statute?
MR. EASTERBFCOK:

You mean if they were

administrative exceptions, Ycur Honor?
QUESTION;

No.

Simply if — if the statute

had just been across the beard.
Mg. EASTERBRCOK;

An argument was raised in

7

the state court that a tax of 20 percent levied cn a

8

base which includes all transportation charges and

9

earlier taxes operates in practice as a discrimination

10

under the principles of Pike against Bruce Church, tut

11

that argument is not being pursued in this Court.

12

The argument on the Commerce Clause that we

13

make here is rather straightforward.

14

Court has held that a state may not levy different taxes

15

on products produced in state and products brought in

16

from out of state.

17

the very multiplicity of preferential trade zones that

18

the Commerce Clause was designed to eliminate.

19

Since 1875 this

Such a differential taxation creates

In response to that fairly simple argument,

20

the State Supreme Court gave three answers.

21

this tax is not designed to discriminate against

22

out-of-state products, but instead to help local

23

Hawaiian industry, and that therefore it has a

24

legitimate purpose.

25

One is that

The second argument is that it's permissible
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

to discriminate against out-cf-state products so long as

2

you permit all wholesalers to sell both the taxed

3

product and the untaxed product.
And third, the Supreme Court of Hawaii argued

4

5

that the tax is fairly apportioned.

Mr. Easterbrook, Paradise and

McKesson did not appeal or did not come here, as they,

hired attorneys.
MR. EASTERBRCOK;

McKesson has

filed a brief, but I assume that McKesson is willing to

bear its own attorney fees as are the other Appellants

in this case.

QUESTIONi

The only thing they’ve saved are

the filing fees.

11

MR. FASTERBRCOK:

12

QUESTIONS

Hmmm-hmm.

Mr. Easterbrook, before you get

13

into the three paints of the Hawaiian Supreme Court's

14

reasoning, those footnotes that point cut that the two

15

products that are exempted are apparently not widely

16

produced throughout the world, to what extent do you

17

contend that all alcoholic beverages are fungible?

18

MR. EASTERERCOK*

We — we say two things

19

about that, Your Honor.

20

statute itself defines the pertinent category as all

21

alcoholic beverages; and in fact, a Hawaii statute --

22

it’s Hawaii revised statute 281-1 -- defines ckclehac tc

23

be an alcoholic beverage.

24
26

The first is that the Hawaiian

And the second part of our argument is that
alcoholic beverages are reasonably substitutable in use;
6

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9M0

1

that someone who drinks okolehao is doing that in

2

preference to tequila or benedictine, someone who drinks

3

the wine that was made in Hawaii is doing that in

4

preference to someone else’s wine, and that that form of

5

substitution is all that’s necessary.

6

that’s why they passed this statute.

7

And indeed,

The legislative history suggests that one

8

reason for exempting okolehao was to enable the

9

producers to advertise nationwide and to boost it, as

10
11

the legislative history said, tc a position of tequila.
QUESTION*

Would your argument be the same if

12

— on behalf of a wholesaler who stocked some of the

13

exempted products?

14

HE. EASTEREECOK*

15

QUESTION*

16
17

Yes, it would, Your Honor.

You’d say even if you carried these

products, that you *d still have the same —
HR. EASTERBRCOK*

Yes.

That the prohibited

18

discrimination is between products and that as a matter

19

of Commerce Clause jurisprudence, the highest tax that

20

can be levied on the product that comes in from out cf

21

state is the tax that's levied on the product from in

22

state, and that taxation here is on the product directly.

23

Two of the three arguments I would like to

24

dismiss very quickly, largely because the state has

25

abandoned them.

One argument,

which is that it is

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

permissible to tax the products at different rates as

2

long as you allow the wholesaler to sell the untaxed

3

product, is inconsistent with the entire line of this

4

Court’s cases, and the State of Hawaii has properly

5

abandoned it in Note 23 of its brief in this Court.

6

The other argument, that so long as the tax is

7

fairly apportioned to transactions in Hawaii, the

8

discrimination is all right, is not even mentioned in

9

this Court by the State of Hawaii.

None of the

10

apportionment cases has to do with express

11

discrimination.

12

Well, that leaves the argument that it's

13

permissible to discriminate because it's beneficial to

14

Hawaiian industry to dc so; and that argument must fail,

15

we submit, because it’s nothing other than a frontal

18

assault on the Commerce Clause.

17

This Court has implemented the Commerce Clause

18

through a rule that no state may enact expressly

19

protectionist laws.

20

exalt its products at the expense of these from outside.

21

No state may, at its own say-so,

Now, we don’t doubt that protectionism is

22

often in fact in the interest of local industry, as the

23

Supreme Court of Hawaii said it was.

25

in passing this statute.

We're not accusing

2

interest of Hawaii that it’s net an irrational law;

3

therefore, it's a constitutional law.
But quite the contrary.

That's why the national government

Discrimination may be practiced

11

only if Congress, on behalf of Hawaii's many affected

neighbors, permits it.
Now, that antidiscrimination principle is

13
14

almost universally applicable, and it's been applied by

15

this Court even when the state has advanced a legitimate

16

reason in support of its discrimination.
In Philadelphia against New Jersey, for

17

example, where the State of New Jersey attempted to

prohibit the import of garbage from out of state, the

13

The Tax Injunction Act requires as a condition

14

of litigation that taxes be paid in to the claiming

15

state, and that means effectively that a rule that the

16

Appellants here could not get refunds would be a rule

17

inviting states to pass and maintain discriminatory

taxes.

19

QUESTION*

Mr. Easterbrook, if your complaint

20

here were an equal protection claim rather than a

Commerce Clause claim and the Court were to agree with

your equal protection analysis, that your client was

denied equal protection of the law because of these

exemptions in the law, typically a mandate from this

Court and an opinion of this Court upholding your

HR. EASTERBRCOKs

There is nothing in the

QUESTIONS

2

Is there a statute of limitations

3 > on collecting tax on past transactions?
HR. EASTERBROOKs

4

The Hawaiian statute of

5

limitations is five years, and the claim here was made

6

in 1979 back to 1974 consistent with the Hawaiian

7

statute.

We're not doubting that statute.
QUESTION;

8
9

Pursuing Justice Rehnquist's

thought that the stipulation indicates the harm caused

10

by the tax, but it doesn't indicate that the harm is any

11

different than it would be if these exotic products had

12

also been taxed.
HR. EASTERBRCOKs

13
14

Honor.

The stipulation is, I am afraid, ambiguous.
I would like to mention just briefly an

15
18

I understand that. Your

argument that Hawaii now makes in this Court.

In the

17

state court the issue was joined rather squarely on the

18

meaning of. the Commerce Clause, and in fact, at page 29

19

of its brief in the Supreme Court of Hawaii, the state

20

expressely repudiated any reliance on the 21st Amendment.
In this Court the state now relies on the 21st

21
22

Amendment.

Needless to say, our first response to that

23

is that the claim is not preserved, it is not properly

24

within the jurisdiction of this Court, and that an

25

effort by the state to invoke a new source of federal
17

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM DAVID DEXTER, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF CF RESPONDENTS

23

25

MR. DEXTER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
The Appellants argue that because for a

1

five-year period Hawaii exempted ckclehao and pineapple

2

wine, which are made only in Hawaii, and which amounted

3

to less than one percent of the total sales of alcoholic

4

beverages in Hawaii, because of these circumstances they

5

are entitled to a refund of all the taxes Hawaii imposed

e

on all alcholic beverages, amounting tc approximately 10

7

percent of the annual budget of Hawaii.
Hew, as indicated by their argument.

8

9

Appellants can only get to this point by arguing that

10

all alcoholic beverages compete with one another, and

11

that the exemption, therefore, creates some kind of a

12

per se discrimination.
This is contrary to a long line of decisions

13
14

of this Court starting with Tiernan v. Einker.

In

15

Tiernan this Court held that the exemption of beer and

16

wine produced in Texas did not invalidate a general

17

liquor tax imposed on all sales of all liquor products.

18

It recognized there that the exemption of beer and wine

19

produced in Texas could only be discriminatory as to

20

imported beer and wine.

21

I'm perfectly delighted to concede that was

9

7 Clayton Act market definition in this case.

10
11

We don't have a Section
There

were some good reasons why that's true.
One is that the stipulation wasn't addressed

12

to this because the state never asserted this in the

13

initial court, and it's very difficult as a practical

14

matter for litigants to cover in stipulations things

15

that their opponents aren't denying.

16

The statute in this case defines the pertinent

17

category as all liquor, and it seemed plausible to me

18

that the plaintiffs were entitled to take the state at

19

its word, at least until the state should deny it.

20

The argument, by the way, that because

21

okolehao is produced only in Hawaii it doesn't compete

22

with Grand Karnier, which is produced only in France,

23

for example, is very strange as a market definition.

The

I suppose the other side of the

5

coin is if the tax were on all bottled beverages, all

and then they had an exemption for these two, then

8

everybody who sold Coca-Cola and everything else would

get the refund, too.

MR. EASTERBRCCKs

be open to the state if it wanted to contradict the

category of competition established in the state’s own

15

if Hawaii had levied a 20 percent tax on all things with

alcohol in them and then exempted aftershave lotion, in
