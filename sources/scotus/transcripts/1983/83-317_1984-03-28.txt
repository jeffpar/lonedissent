ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK R. BENNETT, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF CF PETITIONERS

9

MR. BENNETT;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;

10

This matter is before this Court on a petition

11

for certiorari to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed two

12

injunctive orders concerning operational aspects of the

13

Lcs Angeles County men's central jail, a 5,000 inmate

14

facility operated by the sheriff of the County of Lcs

15

Angeles.

16

The first order required the sheriff to select

17

up to 1500 inmates from the 5,000 inmate population who

18

he determined presented the least likely opportunity or

19

risk of escape or drug potential and to permit them to

20

visit in a setting where they could touch, kiss and

21

embrace their visitors, a practice that has been

22

referred to in the courts as contact visitation.

23

The second order required the sheriff to

24

permit

25

ask questions during the searches.

inmates to observe routine cell searches and to

QUESTION;

12

MR. BENNETT;

Oh, I'm sorry.
Although all male inmates are

13

centralized at one facility, in part because of the size

14

of the County and because of some duties that are

imposed upon the sheriff under state law.

The Court's order with regard to —

12

QUESTION:

Nr. Bennett, when you say they're

13

involved in appellate process, you mean perhaps a motion

14

to suppress that's appealed prior to trial, that sort of

15

thing?
MR. BENNETT:

16

It could be that.

We have

17

really three classes of prisoners within the jail as far

18

as are

19

20

the courts around the jurisdiction.

But they’re not members of the

Isn’t the class just pretrial

MR. BENNETT:

Technically, it was certified as

7

to all prisoners within the jail, which at the time cf

8

certification involved a significant number of sentenced

9

inmates.

10

Now the facility is predominately pretrial.
QUESTION:

I thought the Court of Appeals’

11

opinion referred only to pretrial detainees, that the

12

order only referred to them.

13

MR. BENNETT:

In the progress of this case,

14

virtually all counsel and the courts at all levels

15

focused only on the matters that dealt with pretrial

16

detainees, although —

17

QUESTION:

I mean, the legal issues would be

18

quite different if they were sentenced people, wculd

19

they not?

20
21

22

HR. BENNETT:

That’s perhaps true as to seme

issces.
QUESTION:

But there still are within the

23

technically certified class a small minority who are not

24

pretrial detainees?

25

MR. BENNETT:

We can’t say how small, because

6

1

if an inmate is sentenced on one charge and is a

2

sentenced inmate, but is awaiting trial on ether

3

charges, of which there are many within cur facility, we

4

treat him for our classification purposes as if he is a

5

pretrial detainee.

6

The court’s order requiring us to select up to

7

1500 inmates for these contact visits is in addition to

8

the sheriff's existing procedures to provide inmates an

9

opportunity to maintain their personal relationships,

10

and the sheriff has a three-pronged plan and program to

11

accomplish that.

12

All inmates in the jail have daily access to

13

telephone calls, for unmonitored telephone calls.

14

is fairly unrestricted mail.

There

15

And all inmates have the daily opportunity for

18

a non-contact visit in a setting where inmates and their

17

visitors sit in separated booths on either side of a

18

large glass window and speak over telephones.

19

fashion the sheriff, rather incredibly, handles ever

20

2,000 visitors a day, over 63,000 visitors a month at

21

this one facility.

22

In this

The sheriff has two concerns which led him to

23

adopt this three-prenged plan.

25

recognizes the importance of permitting inmates to

time,

3

prisoners in as safe a manner as possible and free from

5

At the same

the sheriff is also committed to housino his

And to accomplish these two goals, he has

6

chosen this three-pronged plan of daily telephone calls,

7

unrestricted mail, and non-contact visits because it

8

maximizes the frequency of the opportunity to maintain

9

these personal relationships, while at the same time

10
11

minimizing the risks involved.
And it’s fairly obvious why there's no risk

12

under this plan.

13

of the facility, the inmates never leave it.

14

no opportunity to pass contraband.

The visiters never enter the security
There is

15

Because of this and in this fashion, this

16

large number of visitors can be easily handled with

17

minimal risk and without intrusive security measures

18

associated with most other types of visitationi

19

strip searches, no appointments, no screening, no

20

limitation on the visitors that you can see or their

21

names -- without any of those intrusive measures.

22

QUESTION:

no

Is there a claim here, Mr. Bennett,

23

that these objectives could have been accomplished by

24

less intrusive, less restrictive measures?

25

using a wire screen that would prevent the passing of

8

That is,

1

weapons or narcotics, but eliminating the telephone?

2

there a claim?

3

MR. BENNETT:

Is

They did not make that request.

4

Unlike some district court cases concerning other jails

5

where the phones were always inoperative and people had

6

to scream back and forth to be heard, T think the record

7

reflects that this is a fairly modern visitation

8

facility, with well-maintained telephones.

9

The thrust of the plaintiff's claim was

10

contact visits, permitting kissing, touching and

11

embracing, and not sc much the fact that one had to

12

communicate over the telephone.

13
14

QUESTION:

This included children as well as

adults ?

15

MR. BENNETT:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, it did.

I take it that your New York

17

counterpart disagrees with seme cf the things ycu've

18

just said?

19

MR. BENNETT:

Well, I think that the New York

20

facility is certainly different from curs.

21

it's maybe the second or third largest jail in the

22

country, ours is more than twice its size, with unique

23

problems that make it quite different.

24
25

Even though

Plus, administrators place different
priorities on things within their own circumstances and

7

One, he did not see how we could permit

contact visitations within our existing facility;

9

And two, that if contact visitation was

11

manager of it.

Contact visits —

Excuse me, before you go on.

MR. BENNETT:

I’d like to focus on two

aspects:

20

contact visits.

21

Significantly, at the New York facility, if we

5

listen to Warden Gaston from Ryker’s Island, when they

6

permit contact visits he’s found that the most prevalent

7

use is the use of a balloon, that is swallowed -- that

8

is passed through a kiss and swallowed to retrieve

9

later.

He pointed out that their drug problem was sc

10

pervasive that on more than one occasion these empty

11

balloons have clogged up their sewer system.
Contact visitation I think presents a unique

12
13

and unavoidable opportunity for serious and genuine

14

breaches of a facility's security.

Nr. Bennett, before you get into

district court’s order, it cnly applies to those whc

But I think another thing about contact

necessary security measures for it are very intrusive

14

Marshall well pointed out that these strip searches,

15

which are almost universally determined to be necessary

16

with contact visitation, may themselves have adverse

17

psychological impact upon the inmate, that they're

certainly degrading, and that they may present the

15

It may limit

the number of non-ccntact visits that we can permit to

other inmates, and may take immediate personnel away

from other important duties within the jail.
Finally,

4

the jail was net designed for contact

5

visitation, and if we were forced to try and deal with

6

such an order it's clear that rather expensive and

7

complex additional construction would be required.
Two decades of prisoner' rights litigation

8
9

have taught us that the problems of jails are difficult

10

and intractable and not easily solved by judicial

11

decree, and this is because they involve sensitive

12

judgments concerning the confinement of people against

13

their will, to many of whom violence is no stranger, and

where the compulsion to obtain narcotics and other

15

contraband may override rationality, and most

QUESTION:

21

Well, before you leave the contact

22

visit issue, may I ask you.

As I understand it, if

23

we're talking about pretrial detainees the issue is

24

whether it can be punishment under Bell against

25

Wolfish.

In your view, could it ever be punishment, no

natter how long the incarceration, to deny a person who

2

has not yet been tried any contact whatsoever with his

family?

KB. BENNETT:

Could that ever constitute punishment?
I don't think the mere question

of contact visits rises to constitutional proportions.

QUESTION:

Well, it does if it’s punishment.

Then the answer is it’s net

MR. BENNETT:

indicated in our briefs, are really not very

distinguishable from this Court's prior examination of

reasoning and analysis of Judge Frankel that was

1

QUESTIONS

Er. Brcnstein, I have a

2

recollection, but I haven’t been able to check, it out,

3

cf a case that came to us from the Second Circuit that

4

involved a contact visit with the mother bringing a

5

small child in, and in New York they had, or at least in

6

the Second Circuit, there had been a screen barrier that

7

was preventing the transfer of drugs or weapons or

8

anything else.

9

Do you recall that case?

10

MR. BRONSTEIN;

11

QUESTIONS

12

HE. BRONSTEIN;

No --

Perhaps I'm confusing one --- net specifically.

There is

13

in that circuit, but at the district court level, the

14

Boudin versus Thomas case,

which dealt with the right of

15

a woman detainee to visit,

to have a contact visit with

16

her infant child.

17

That case is cited in our brief, and there the

18

Bureau of Prisons wanted to make an exception of this

the constitutional bases for the contact visit order --

Perhaps Mr. Bennett can clarify that on his rebuttal.
The trial court first found, following the

officials to security concerns, which the trial court

Also going through this issue are the fact that

On the first argument, Wolfish teaches us that

22

a detainee has the right to be free of any punishment,

23

and whether a condition or practice, the total

24

prohibition in this case, is punishment is essentially a

25

factual question.

4

MR. ERONSTEIN;

Eut in context, if the entire

5

district court opinion is read, I think it is clear that

6

he specifically follows Wolfish by finding the

7

exaggerated response.

8

Even before Wolfish, in February of 1979, the

9

district court in its first opinion, at Petitioner's

10

appendix 30, the district court before Wolfish said,

11

utilizing -- that he would utilize the exaggerated

12

response test set forth in Feeley versus Sampson, a

13

First Circuit case approved by this Court in Wclfish at

14

two different points, rather than the strict scrutiny or

15

compelling interest test of Campbell, because it is less

10

burdensome to the custodial authority.

17

Throughout these proceedings, even before

Wolfish — in fact, the Ninth Circuit thought that the

district court had already anticipated Wolfish, but

20

remanded it out of an excess of caution.

The ultimate conclusion is a finding, is a mixed

finding, one which I think would be governed by this

8

Court's decision in Sumner versus Matar, also a

9

case.

19B2

And I think the questions of fact that underlie

10

the ultimate legal conclusion are governed by the

11

presumption of correctness.
The facts in Pullman are very close to this

12
13

one, because there this Court said that whether the

14

differential impact of a seniority system reflected an

15

intent to discriminate was a factual finding, subject to

16

the clearly erroneous rule.

similarly a factual issue.

the impression that was left earlier about what that

It is not an order that says that any prisoner

What it says is that any prisoner who is in the area

may, under these very specific provisions, observe the

then there was this special accommodation to

allow the prisoner to observe the cell search.

of substantive due process.

I think, that it was not a search and seizure question,

15

but since we have already determined that a prisoner

18

does — that the state may not take property without

17

some procedural due process, he found that if those

18

things were taken there was no adequate procedural

19

protection, such as the damage claim mentioned by

20

footnote 38 in Wolfish; and that under Parratt v.

21

Taylor, which reaffirms that a state may not take

22

property without some sort cf hearing or, as the Court

23

said in Parratt, a meaningful hearing at a meaningful

24

time,

25

to prevent the taking.

the only time to do that is in a prophylactic way,

I think that was his analysis.

But he clearly

limited it, I think because cf Wolfish, to those

prisoners in the immediate area of the cell search.

entirety, which is what was at issue in Wolfish.

That was the basis for his ruling.
I submit, I agree that it is a closer question

11

because the facts are so close to the Wolfish case.

12

I think, for all of the reasons that I have set forth,

13

this Court should affirm the decision of the Ninth

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT CF FREDERICK R. EENNETT, ESC.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BENNETT*

I*d like to direct my attention

22

just briefly to this 39-month inmate, because it may

23

cause some concern to seme members of the Court.

24

There's nothing in the record to indicate that's a

25

routine or other than an exception.

40

And I point out that every one of these

pretrial inmates is before a judge in a pending criminal

3

case,

4

confinement and the treatment of that prisoner during

5

trial.

6

the record that's easy to overlook, and it's set forth

7

on page 62 of the joint appendix, and it was a fact

8

stipulated to between the parties at the outset of the

9

litigation, and it reads:

which regularly makes orders concerning

What's significant about that is one portion of

prisoners and visitors is net routinely permitted."

19

made such a request.

In conclusion, we do argue that the Court as a

21

matter of law should net find contact visits

22

constitutionally required; given the unavoidable risks,

23

given the availability of relatively risk-free

24

alternatives, that the Court should not find that a

25

court is warranted in substituting its judgment either

41

1

for the jailer who operates that jail or for the local

2

and state officials and government for which they work.
New York is a prime example,

With regard to the findings, as we've

6
7

indicated in our brief I don’t think the findings of th e

8

court support either its conclusions or the position of

9

the inmates.

It’s clear when you compare the three

10

decisions that the court merely substituted its

11

perception of what was re asonable for that of the

12

sherif f.
When you look at the first initial decision,

13
14

the court looked at two different tests; a compelling

15

necessity test that came out of the New York courts,

16

which

circuit.

19

tests,

20

two tests were the same, that only they differed in

21

theoretical analysis, but the result was the same.

22

Still a balancing test.

25

And it said even then, between these two

at the petition appendix page 30, that even those

When you get to the final decision after

after Wolfish, the court no longer talks about

tne compelling necessity test, but he talks about his

42

prior test and he says, even the test of Wolfish and

2

what I did before is the same, that really — and that

3

was at the appendix 25.
Whether you’re talking about the compelling

the tests the same and the result is the same.

He first looked at his perception of what was

10
11

an appropriate way to deal with this problem of

12

permitting inmates to maintain personal relationships,

and worked backwards to try to make the test fit that

result.
