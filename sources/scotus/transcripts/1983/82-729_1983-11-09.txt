ON EFHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

8

HR. SCHULDER;

Thank you.

Nr. Chief Justice,

9 \ ard may it please the Court, the basic question in this
10

case is whether a statute that prohibits a publisher

11

from printing an illustration of U.S. currency in color

12

rather than in black and white, or in dimensions

13

approximating the size' of genuine currency,

and they must be viewed in tandem.

editors and publishers.

fact that a number of illustrations of currency in

2

Time’s magazines violated the color and size

3

requirements of the statutory scheme.

4

The district court entered summary judgment

S

for Time and held Sections 474, Paragraph 6, and 504.1

6

unconstitutional on their face and as applied to Time.

7

The district court concluded that Section 474, Paragraph

8

6, was overbroad because it prohibits all reproductions

9

of currency without regard to whether the reproduction

10
11

has a capacity to deceive.
Turning to Section 504.1,

the court focused on

12

the purpose and forum provisions of the statute, and

13

held that the statute is an impermissible regulation of

14

the manner of depicting currency because, first of all,

15

it is a content based statute that requires an inquiry

16

into whether an illustration is undertaken or produce!

17

for one of the purposes specified in the statute, and

18

two, the court concluded that there wag no nexus between

19

the statutory goal of preventing counterfeiting and the

20

newsworthiness or educational value of an illustration

21

or the type of forum in which the illustration appears.

22

The court also held Section 5G4 void for

23

vagueness, because it concluded that it is difficult to

24

determine what is a philatelic, numismatic, educational,

25

historical, or newsworthy purpose, and what is a

The government's basic submission in this case

had created administrative exceptions to the broad ban

in d74, and in fact had permitted the use of

3

illustrations of currency for certain of these

4

pur poses.

5

Congress essentially codified this

6

administrative practice in the statute, but we sumbit

that Congress did net intend in enacting this statute to

require Secret Service agents to pore over every single

publication that might contain an illustration of

currency in order to determine whether —

MR. SCHULDER:

We suggest that the Court

construe the statute narrowly, so that the statute would

permit the printing of illustrations of obligations or

as those illustrations comply with the three conditions

set out in the statute.

try to explain why the lines that are drawn in this

problem with the statute, then we submit that Section

of U.S. currency.

6

QUESTION:

Aren't we always in a sensitive

7

area when you have a statute authorizing some government

8

official to decide what is or what is not newsworthy?

9

MR. SCHOLDER:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

10

that is why we have proposed this narrowing construction

11

of the statute, which we feel is fully consistent with

12

Congress's intent —

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, how do you narrow that

construction?

15

MR. SCHDLDER:

16

QUESTION:

Excuse me?

How do you narrow the phrase in the

17

exception, "newsworthy purposes, including newspapers,

18

journals, articles?"

19

MR. SCHULDER:

Well, the way we have, suggested

20

that it be construed is that these various purposes and

21

forums be looked at as illustrative.

22

Congress was setting out groups of illustrations of the

23

types of forums and purposes that were permissible.

24

only purpose here that is mentioned as being

25

impermissible is advertising purposes, but we would

MR. SCHULDER;

QUESTION;

That's correct.

May I inquire?

The three things

22

you want to retain are the size limitation, the black

Is that right?
MR . SCHULDER*

And the- reason for that is that

purposes, but there is a restriction in the statute that

Just to make sure that no one would mistake

6

MR. SCHULDER;

7

QUESTION;

That's correct, Your Honor.

Well, it would seem to me that

something in color, if it were large enough or small

11

NR. SCHULDER;

12

QUESTION;

Well, the problem —

I mean, it doesn't make any

difference how large or small it is.

14

it violates the statute.

15

MR. SCHULDER;

If it is in color,

That's correct.

Now, let me

18

explain that the statute — there are basically two

17

problems that the statute is directed at. One is the

18

finished product, and both the color and size

19

limitations would go to that, because a full color,

Even if anybody would know

MR. SCHULDER;

That's correct, because the

11

process that is used to create that photograph is

12

identical to the process that is used by a vast majority

13

of counterfeiters.

14

QUESTION;

I know, but if it is the process,

if it is the process, what do you care about the results

of the process being circulated?

17

that doesn't go on on the magazine.

that all this machinery or whatever, the plates or

MR. SCHULDER;

Well, but by limiting the use

Rut you do agree that this is a

balancing process, from what you responded.
10

MR. GOLD;

That there is some element of

11

balancing in that once the government demonstrates that

12

this is advancing in some way their interest, then maybe

13

our First Amendment rights to some extent have to give

14

way, but there has been no such demonstration.

15

QUESTIONS

Frequently we either modify or

16

strike down a statute because we conclude or other

17

courts conclude that there are less intrusive, less

18

difficult means of accomplishing the same objective.

1

Would we then weigh whether a publishing house has other

20

means of accomplishing their objective without striking

21

down an Act of Congress?

22

&R. GOLD;

Yes, once you are convinced that

the government has demonstrated that this is a danger.

because the Treasury Department decided that the statute

5

SR. GOLDs

I think there are two answers to

that.

8

legislation that is pending in which certain publishers

9

are trying to get color removed, but to go back to 1958,

The first is, there is currently, as the

1

the Secret Service was at our door with varying

2

interpretations, and many interpretations that would

3

stop us from, publishing.

4

Indeed, one thing to keep in mind is that the

5

Secret Service has interpreted this statute in its

narrowest form whenever it could.

7

It has tried to close whatever it could to prevent

things from being published, right down tc when they at

with expert testimony of traffic people and a lot of
