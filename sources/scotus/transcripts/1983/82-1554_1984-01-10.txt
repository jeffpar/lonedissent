ON BEHAIF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MS. SNURKOWSKI;

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, the issue before the Court today is
10

whether the Eleventh Circuit’s en banc decision setting

11

forth the standards by which prejudice and the

12

competency level of a defendant in a collateral action,

13

the manner in which that standard should be applied is

14

up for consideration.
The state is very concerned because this

15
16

particular case concerns three major topics of interest

17

to the state of Florida, and that is that we have a

18

standard that has been imposed by the Eleventh Circuit

1

en banc which upends the standards that the Circuit

20

Courts have addressed.

21

is in direct conflict and it acknowledges conflict with

22

a D.C.

in conflict with the Florida Supreme Court’s assessment

12

complaint with the opinion is the concern, is the

13

concern the state cf Florida has with the integrity cf

14

the trial judges and the Florida Supreme Court's review

15

of competency of counsel, the question of whether the

16

ultimate fact determined by — the ultimate fact

17

determined by the Florida Supreme Court should be given

some deference.

The third part of our

Here they used a standard that has not been

20

attacked per se as being unconstitutional.

The state is

21

contending that in fact where a state court, the Florida

22

Supreme Court in this particular instance, has reviewed

23

a claim of competency of counsel, that standard is

24

constitutional in the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment.

25

collateral action in federal court should be limited to,

2

first of all, whether the standard is constitutional.

3

If you get past that point, whether in fact the Florida

4

Supreme Court or the trial court in reviewing this

5

initially has made an assessment, a determination as to

6

the correctness of the sentence based on counsel's

7

representations of the defendant at that time.

Those are the three main concerns we have with
this case.

The facts of the case reflect that Hr.

10

Washington pled guilty to three murders.

11

during a crime spree, unexplained crime spree that

12

happened in September of 1976.

13

in cur record with regard to the murders.

14

Washington, without counsel's acccuntenance, pled

15

guilty.

he waived the sentencing proceeding, which is part of.

demonstrating that there was seme prejudice, and in this

fell below that of reasonably effective assistance cf

counsel.

3

That is the Knight standard.
The trial court found that in applying that

4

standard Mr. Washington had not met any of the

5

standards, that it was summarily reversible because the

6

14 affidavits tendered to the court and the two

7

affidavits of psychiatrists and a psychologist did not

refute — first of all, they only vent to non-statutory

MS. SNURKCWSKI*

I don't believe that is —

21

No, I don’t believe that’s what we’re doing.

We are

22

looking at something as a collateral action here.

23

are talking about the sentencer being the trial judge

Well, if as a matter cf law the new

21

he has the burden of demonstrating that it was through

22

no dilatory actions of his own that he didn’t uncover

23

it. Certainly that would not be a consideration in this

24

particular issue, but the second part of that, would it

The defendant says, yes, this is all that

2

So in fact you have a sentencer who has made a

3

determination.

The question new becomes, has there been

4

anything new introduced into this equation that would

5

require a modification of that?

6

the trial court and the Florida Supreme Court in

7

reviewing this particular claim held that beyond a moral

8

certainty this factual recital, this new bit of

9

information would not have changed the outcome, that in

In this particular case

10

fact as a matter of law there were aggravating

11

circumstances that were not challenged, there were no

12

mitigating — statutory mitigating circumstances, and

13

that the new material did net create nen-statutory

14

mitigating circumstances, and therefore death was

15

appropriate under Florida statute.

16

Under the authorities of Florida cases, where

17

you have one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating

18

circumstance, death is an appropriate sentence.
Again, the facts, as I said, there was a

19
20

guilty plea to all these cases without regard to what

21

counsel was counseling Hr. Washington in this particular

22

case.

23

and complains about that which has been done.

question as far as he was concerned, but he ruled

4

During the course of the evidentiary hearing

5

on this matter, Hr. Tunkey, who was Hr. Washington's

6

counsel, was called to testify by the defendant.

7

who were called to testify were Judge Fuller and the

8

defendant himself.

9

important in this particular case is what Hr. Tunkey

Cthers

The main focus, though, I think is

10

said,

because Hr. Tunkey was now being asked to tell the

11

court,

12

you do this, why did you do that, did you stop, did you

13

stop your investigation, did you stop your

14

representation of this man once you felt you had this

15

sunken feeling that because he pled guilty he was ret

16

taking your advice?

inform the court what was the purpose, why did

That was the nature of the inquiry of Mr.

17
18

Tunkey.

It was not that the Florida Supreme Court cr

19

the trial court had reviewed the facts in light of the

20

affidavits prepared and that in fact it demonstrated

21

that there was no entitlement to relief, but rather Mr.

22

Tunkey, what did you do and why did you do this?

23

that is -- Past that point, the trial court after the

24

evidentiary hearing assessed that while, while we, after

25

we have asked him all these questions, and because time

2

answer candidly, because he is in fact, he is in fact

3

being pitted against his own client, or maybe because he

4

doesn't know the answer, or maybe because he doesn't

5

remember how he reasoned out why he did something, we

6

have a record that reflects Mr. Tunkey's recollecticns

7

of what occurred.

8
9

The trial, federal district judge found that
while his judgment may not have been correct in all

10

instances, he could not find that prejudice pursuant to

11

DeCcster, and that is that would likely affected the

12

outcome, had occurred, and therefore he denied the

13

petition for writ of habeas corpus.

14

The matter was taken by the Eleventh Circuit

15

on direct appeal, and the en banc court, after a panel

16

decision, concluded the standard to be — could, with

17

regard to the prejudice aspect could be things that —

18

could it have been helpful, that was the term, helpful

19

to the defense.

20

The defendant only had to come forward and say, I am

21

showing you that these things could have been helpful to

22

my defense.

23

That was the standard of prejudice.

The en banc panel rejected helpfulness, and in

24

lieu of that substituted that under Fradey there was a

25

likelihood or not likelihood, that substantial and

The Eleventh Circuit suggested that because

it had

made an assessment that there iray have teen errors in

20

that perhaps in a sentencing hearing the colors are a

good deal more blurred and the contours less distinct

22

than when you are talking about proving the elements of

do something or not do something should much less

than it might be where you are

MR. SHAPIRO*

That might be in a case, Ycur

4

where counsel exercises that judgment, and where

6

that is indicated by the record, but in this case, as I

6

have pointed out, the District Court found that the lack

7

of investigation and consequently the inability to

8

present mitigating evidence was due to counsel's sense

9

of hopelessness and a lack cf investigation.

that this lack of investigation amounted to ineffective

is important to consider first of all that Mr. Tunkey

advanced certain positions at the sentencing phase and

was unable to present the evidence that would support

HR. SHAPIRCs

Well, Your Honor, I think that

15

beyond the record demonstrating that counsel failed to

16

present the evidence that would have supported his

17

sentencing argument, the record also demonstrates that

18

counsel failed to fulfill the basic responsibilities of

19

an advocate, and this substantially undermined his

ability to present his case at the sentencing hearing.

7

non-statutory mitigating circumstances have often made a

non-statutory mitigating circumstances.

Had Mr. Turnkey

10

conducted an investigation, he could have supported two

11

premises in his argument for David Washington's life,

12

which he did try to advance.

13

One was that David Washington had a spark

14

within him which was good, which was decent.

Another

15

was, in his argument, counsel states that no one

16

understands why Mr. Washington might have done what he

17

did or did what he did, and yet there was evidence cf --

18

psychiatric and psychological evidence that could have

19

been available to him upon reasonable investigation,

20

that would have established that the combination of

21

child abuse, deprivation, and neglect as a youth

22

combined with the extraordinary pressures that were

23

placed on Mr. Washington at the time of the crimes led

24

to the severe mental and emcticnal distress which

25

resulted in his breakdown during that period of time.

First, the standard must preserve the

7

How is that different — How is

that different, counsel, from a motion for a new trial

on the grounds of newly discovered evidence?
HR. SHAPIRCs

1

Well, it is different in two

11

basic respects. Your Honor.

One is that the motion for

12

new trial is not a motion that attacks or deals with the

13

Sixth

14

that a motion for new trial assumes that the defendant

15

had a fair trial, competent counsel.

16

on the basis of newly discovered evidence, it says that

17

there was something wrong with the judgment, something

wrong with the integrity of the verdict, and in that

case the focus should be directly on the integrity,

represented by an otherwise competent counsel than if he

2

just couldn’t find the evidence?

3

HE. SHAPIBC*

I don't understand it.

Well, for one, Your Honor, it is

4

because the failures of counsel bring into question the

5

integrity of the entire judgment in the same way, and

6

that is the teaching of Gideon, the teaching of Gideon

7

that ycu don't have a fair trial without adequate

8

counsel, in the same way that the lack of the newly

9

discovered evidence called into question the integrity

10

of the final judgment.

11

You can't have a fair, fundamentally fair judgment

12

without adequate counsel.

13

The analogy is a pure analogy.

The second respect is that the test that we

14

propose and the test in the Court of Appeals would

15

ensure that even if there was no,

16

absolutely no effect on the outcome, that is, the state

17

could demonstrate that the undiscovered evidence was

18

harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant would

not be entitled to relief.

Yes, if he conducted a

11

evidence, that would be something different than if

12

counsel conducted — failed to — if counsel conducted

13

MR. SHAPIRCs

Yes, it would, Your.Honor,

8

because there has been no determination of whether the

counsel's error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,

10

which is the third feature of our test, and which also

11

is the way in which cur test accommodates society's

12

interest in finality in the same way and in a much mere

compelling way it accommodates the Sixth Amendment right

and society's interest in finality by focusing on

outcome at the appropriate stage in the analysis, when

would not have been different beyond a — that the error

was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

In contrast, the test that we have suggested

There are few cases where counsel’s

performance has resulted in the reversal of conviction,

and there has been no indication in the circuits that

they should abandon such a focus on the impairment of

Thank you. Your Honor.
The state would contend that the assessment

here that there was a failure to investigate or produce

8

witnesses, that is a limited review cf what

9

investigation is supposed to be.

If you look at this

10

record , you will find that Mr. Tunkey did on numerous

11

occasions talk with Mr. Washington with regard to the

12

case.
He did discuss, as a matter cf fact, at the

close of the state’s case, at the proceeding, the

15

sentencing proceeding, Mr. Tunkey and Mr. Washington

16

spoke

At that point the court asked, well, are you going tc

present any evidence?

19

then he proceeded to go through why certain aggravating

circum stances were appropriate, why certain mitigating

21

circum stances may or may not be appropriate, through

22

what he had produced in his sentencing brief.

23

with regard to what evidence should be presented.

He said, no, Your Honor.

And I might add,

And

we need to look not just at

what the allegation is, but what the man did, what Mr.

Tunkey did in behalf of Mr. Washington with regard tc
