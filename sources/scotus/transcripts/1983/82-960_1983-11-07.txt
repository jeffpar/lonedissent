CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Come, I think

you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

6
7

and may it please the Court:
This case, which is here on certiorari to

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice,

the Sixth Circuit, involves the propriety of the Labor

10

Board's conclusion that an individual employee's honest

11

and reasonable assertion of a right that is provided

12

for in a collective bargaining agreement, whose concerted

13

activity was in the meaning of Section 7 of the National

14

Labor Relations Act.
The underlying facts briefly are as follows:

15
16

Respondent hauls garbage for the

City of Detroit from

17

a drop-off point to a landfill some 37 miles away.

18

The garbage is hauled by tractor trailers and normally

19

a driver is assigned to a certain tractor trailer and

20

when his vehicle is in for repairs he may be assigned

21

to another one.
Respondent is a party to a collective bargaining

22
23

agreement with the local Teamsters Union covering its

24

drivers.

25

provides that the employer shall not require employees

Section 1 of Article XXI of the Agreement

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

to take out on the streets or highways any vehicle

2

that is not in safe operating condition or equipped

3

with the safety compliances prescribed by law.

4

It further provides that it shall not be

5

a violation of this Agreement where employees refuse

6

to operate such equipment unless such refusal is un­

7

justified.

8

A further provision of the Agreement provides

9

that the employer shall not ask or require any employee

10

to take out equipment that has been reported by any

11

other employee as being in unsafe operating condition

12

unless the same has been approved as being safe by

13

the mechanical department.

14

James Brown was a driver for the Respondent.

15

He normally drove Truck No. 245.

16

12, 1979, he had a near accident with Truck No. 244

17

driven by another employee, Frank Hamilton, when the

18

brakes on 24-4 would not stop the truck at a landfill.'

19

On Saturday, May

Hamilton took Truct 244 back to the drop-off

20

point and with Brown present the mechanics told him

21

that the truck would be fixed over the weekend or the

22

first thing Monday morning.

23

Brown returned to work at 4:00 a.m. on Monday,

24

14th.

25

found that the fifth wheel had a problem.

He took out his Truck 245 to the landfill and
He returned

440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

to the drop-off point, talked to the mechanics and

2

learned that the truck could not be fixed that day.

3

He then spoke to his supervisor, Jasmund,

4

who told him to punch out and go home after confirming

5

that Brown's truck could not be fixed.

6

Brown punched out, but remained in the driver's

7

room, at which point Jasmund returned and requested

8

Brown to drive Truck 244.

9

do so since 244 had a brake problem.

10
11

Brown said he would not
Jasmund instructed

Brown to go home and the two had a heated exchange.
Another supervisor, Madary, came on the scene,

12

and when Brown reported that 244 had problems, Madary

13

replied that half the trucks around here have problems

14

and if Respondent tried to deal with all of them it

15

would be unable to do business.

16

During the conversation, Brown asked, Bob,

17

what are you going to do, put the garbage ahead of

18

the safety of the men?

19

he or Jasmund make any attempt to show Brown that Truck

20

244 had, in fact, been repaired and was safe.

21

22
23

Madary did not reply nor did

Brown went home and later that day he was
discharged.
The Union's Recording Secretary received

24

notice of the discharge that day and he and Brown returned

25

to the plant and sought to get Jasmund and Madary to put

2

Bob back to work, but they refused to do so.
The next day Brown filed a written grievance

3

under the collective bargaining agreement alleging

4

that he had been discharged in violation of the contract.

5

6

The Union declined to pursue Brown's grievance
beyond the first step of the grievance procedure.

7

QUESTION:

Does the record show why?

8

MR. COME:

The record indicates, in Respondent's

9

Exhibit 10, which is not printed in the Joint Appendix,

10

but which is in the record, that they found no merit

11

to the grievance.

12

later that afternoon by another employee.

13

Apparently the truck was driven

QUESTION:

Mr. Come, if then the employee

14

had filed a 301 suit against the employer for an illegal

15

discharge, in order to win that, he would have had

16

to prove a breach of the fiduciary duty that the Union

17

owed him, wouldn't he?

18

would be dismissed.

is right, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

25

of its Administrative Law Judge, concluded that the

The Board, upholding the decision

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

Respondent had violated 8(a)(1) of the National Labor

2

Relations Act by discharging Brown.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Come?

4

MR. COME:

Yes, sir.

5

QUESTION:

I read the. Administrative Law

6

Judge's findings fairly carefully and I am interested

7

to know what is the Board's position as to the reason

8

that the Administrative Law Judge assigned that the

9

company used to discharge Brown?

Why did the Administrative

10

Law Judge think that Brown had been discharged?

11

don't want exact quotes, but —

12

MR. COME:

I

The Administrative Law Judge found

13

that Brown had been discharged for asserting his contract

14

rights not to drive an unsafe truck; that he had a

15

good faith and a reasonable belief at least that the

16

truck was unsafe and that under the Board's Interboro

17

Doctrine the assertion of a reasonable and good faith

18

contract claim is concerted activity protected by Section

19

7 of the Act.

20

QUESTION:

What if the company contend that

21

Brown was discharged for failing to obey an order,

22

an order to get back and drive 244?

23

Board's response still be the same?

24
25

MR. COME:

Now, would the

I think it would, Your Honor,

because the — If, in fact, Brown was engaging in concerted

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

activity protected by Section 7> the mere fact that the

2

company classified as as insubordination would not

3

remove the protection of Section 7.

4

There is an issue in this case which was

5

not reached by the Sixth Circuit and would be open

6

on remand; namely, whether or not Brown, in fact, was

7

refusing to drive this truck because of good faith

8

beliefs that it was unsafe or whether there were other

9

reasons for his refusal.
QUESTION:

10

You are saying Brown is purported

11

to exercise the rights given him by a promise in the

12

contract?

13

MR. COME:

That is correct.

14

QUESTION:

A promise that the employer made.

15

MR. COME:

That is correct, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION:

Now, suppose there weren't any

17

specific promises about equipment, but the employer

18

promised never to discharge anyone without proper cause.

19

I think that is a normal promise, isn't it?

20

discharge people without proper cause.

21

facts happened and Brown — and he was fired and he

22

claimed that that wasn't good enough cause.

23

did was — I didn't want to drive a truck without brakes

24

and he took it to a grievance and the Union refused

25

to press it and then he filed an unfair labor practice

You don't

So, the same

All I

1

proceeding.
Don't you, in effect, say that any breach

2
3

of the employer of the collective bargaining contract

4

is an unfair labor practice if it results in a discharge

5

and regardless of whether or not the Union could or

6

would ever be held guilty of a refusal to fairly repre­

7

sent employees?

8
9
10

MR. COME:

Well, I think that you may have

to separate out a couple of problems in your hypothetical
example.

11

QUESTION:

It has them there, I know that.

12

MR. COME:

The Board's basic position is

13

that the right of an individual to assert a contract

14

right in good faith and in reason —

15
16
17
18
19

QUESTION:

Such as the right not to be fired

without good cause even.
MR. COME:

— is protected by Section 7 against

reprisal for asserting that right.
Now, it does not follow, however, that every

20

assertion of a right under a contract can be followed

21

by a refusal to work if you are not granted your claim,

22

because if there is a no-strike clause in the contract,

23

the activity, though it may be concerted might forfeit

24

the protection of Section 7.

25

Now, in this case, you do have a work refusal,

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

however, the question of whether that would render

2

the activity unprotected in our view is not presented

3

in this case because Respondent did not raise that

4

issue either before the Board or the Court of Appeals.

5

The only issue that he raised, apart from the factual

6

one as to whether or not, in fact, it was safety that

7

motivated him, was whether the activity was concerted

8

where it involved merely the action of an employee

9

acting alone.

10

QUESTION:

And that is the Interboro Doctrine?

11

MR. COME:

That is the Interboro Doctrine.

12

QUESTION:

Okay.

I would like to ask you

13

a hypothetical question about the Interboro Doctrine.

14

Supposing that a collective bargaining agreement provided

15

that in the event of a dispute over an obligation to

16

work overtime the employee had to work overtime as

17

requested and file a grievance later.

18

an employee operating under that contract refused to

19

do the overtime and simply walked off. the job.

20

would the Interboro Doctrine protect him even though

21

he had not complied with the contract?

22

MR. COME:

And suppose

Now,

I don't think it would in that

23

circumstance, Your Honor, because the contract there

24

specifically made it clear, as I understand the example,

25

that —

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

2
3

QUESTION:

Well then don't you have a problem

with the Board's treatment of the contract here, because,
as I understand the contract provision that he was

4

working under, it didn't provide that his refusal to

5

work on the basis of safety would need only be honestly

6

and reasonably held.

7

8
9
10

11
12

13
14
15

I think the contract requires

more objective justification, yet the Board has simply
substituted its own term, I think, for the safety provision.
MR. COME:

No, Your Honor, that is not the

position that we are urging here orr: our reading of
the Administrative Law Judge's findings which the Board
adopted, although to be sure, in some Board decisions,
there is some confusion as to whether the Board is
applying a purely subjective standard or whether it
requires that the refusal not only be in good faith,

16

but reasonable.

17

that the decision rests not only upon the subjective

18

standard, but there has to be some objective basis

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

The facts of those cases will show

that makes the employee's claim reasonable.
And, the ALJ here so found in both respects
and that is the question we are presenting here and
that is the submission that we are making.
QUESTION:

Well, is it slightly reasonable

to protect the people in Detroit from hugh sludge trucks
running around without brakes?

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

MR. COME:

I believe it is, Your Honor, and

2

for that reason I believe that is why the parties negotiated

3

the kind of contract clause that you have here which

4

guarantees the employee not only a safe truck, but

S

it provides that it shall not be a violation of this

6

agreement where employees refuse to operate such equipment

7

unless such refusal is unjustified.

8
9

But, a point that I want to make though is
that as we view the record in this case the unprotected

10

aspect on which the Respondent dwells at great length

11

in its brief here is not presented in this case.

12

only issue that was presented here is whether or not

13

the fact that the employee acted alone in forcing a

14

collectively bargained right made it not concerted

15

activity.

16

That is the Interboro Doctrine.

The

That is

17

the> basis on which the Court of Appeals affirmed Respondent's

18

position and for that theory it makes no difference

19

whether the employee here had merely protested driving

20

an unsafe truck and was fired for making the protest

21

or whether he momentarily hesitated or whether, in

22

fact, he refused to drive as he did here.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Would he have had to have protested

at all to invoke the Interboro Doctrine?
MR. COME:

Well, I think he has to give the

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

employer some indication that it is a contract right

2

that he is claiming.
QUESTION:

3

Well, suppose he does exactly

4

what he is told up to a point, then just refuses, walks

5

off, gets fired, just the way it happened here, except

6

he doesn't make any statement at all at the time and

7

the next day he files a grievance, as I believe he

8

did here.

9

protest to invoke the Interboro Doctrine?

Is the mere filing of that grievance a sufficient

MR. COME:

10

I think that it would be because,

11

as a matter of fact, even the courts that have disapproved

12

or rejected the Interboro Doctrine and there is a conflict

13

in the circumstance, feel that to discharge an employee

14

for filing a grievance is a violation of 8(a)(1) because

15

filing a grievance is, though it is filed by an individual

16

employee, concerted activty.
QUESTION:

17

Would the Board recognize any

18

distinction between firing this person — firing him

19

because he filed a grievance as opposed to firing him

20

because he refused to carry out a lawful order?
MR. COME:

21

Weli, in some cases, it would,

22

but as I tried to explain, in many cases where it would

23

be a breach of a no-strike clause to refuse to work

24

the activity would forfeit the protection of Section

25

7.

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

That is not the case here because of the

2

special contract clause here which, in effect, is an

3

exception to the no-strike clause, undoubtedly for

4

the reason that Justice Marshall pointed out, that

5

in the safety situations it is often a small comfort

6

to have the right to file a grievance after

7

risked your life and lost.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

you have

But, the Interboro Doctrine isn't

limited to safety at all, is it?
MR. COME:

No, it is not limited to safety,

11

but the point I am trying to make is that the Interboro

12

Doctrine deals essentially with the issue that is here;

13

namely, whether or not an individual's assertion of

14

a contract right in good faith and reasonably based

15

is concerted activity for purposes of Section 7.

16

QUESTION:

Of course, if the answer is yes,

17

as you say it is, and the Board thinks it is, then

18

the Board immediately proceeds to determine whether

19

this contract right, which is a protected right, has

20

been violated.

21

the employee actually had some reasonable grounds for

22

his actions and if he did, why, there is an unfair

23

labor practice.

24

And they would also do that even if this case had gone

25

right straight to arbitration and the arbitrator had

And, here, it would be whether or not

Isn't that — It is as simple as that.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

decided that he had been properly fired.

2
3

MR. COME:

Then you get into the further

question —

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MR. COME:

— as to the circumstances under

6

which the Board will defer to the arbitrators.

7

QUESTION:

Suppose the employee had never

8

asked the Union to — anything and suppose no grievance

9

had been filed.

Why couldn't the employee, if this

10

is an unfair labor practice, why can't the employee

11

go right to the Board and forget the whole grievance

12

machine?

13

is a joint right, I am expressing a collective right

14

under the contract, and it was violated by the employer.

All he has to do is say I have a right, it

15

MR. COME:

He could.

16

QUESTION:

So, the employee never needs to

17

exercise the machinery.

18

QUESTION:

19

of the contract, wouldn't it?

20

MR. COME:

That would just make mincemeat

No, it would not.

I mean the

21

Section 7 rights can operate in tantem with contract

22

rights.

23

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Come, does the Board

24

make it a practice, when the employee, in fact, initiates

25

a grievance procedure, does the Board make it a practice

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

to pursue a complaint in cases like this?

Interboro

says you may, but what is the Board’s practice?

Does

it do it as a matter of practice?
MR. COME:

For a time under the Collier Doctrine

the Board would defer in these situations where there
was available a grievance arbitration.
QUESTION:

And tell the employee go that

route even if he hadn't started?
MR. COME:

If that- were available.

The current Board policy is not to defer
unless the employee or the Union has pursued the grievance
procedure and there has been a determination.
QUESTION:

By an arbitrator.

MR. COME:

By an arbitrator.

QUESTION:

You mean if initiated when the

complaint is filed, but not completed, that is the
arbitration proceeding, the Board then proceeds?
MR. COME:

Well, if it has been initiated,

they will wait.
QUESTION:

They will wait.

QUESTION:

It was completed here.

MR. COME:

Well, it wasn't completed in any

QUESTION:

They filed a grievance.

formal -It was

rejected and the Union refused to go any further so

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that terminated the entire procedure.

2

MR. COME:

Well, the Union has, as Your Honor

3

pointed out, I believe, a lot of reason why they do

4

not proceed with the grievance.

5

QUESTION:

But, their regular policy now

6

is that not to defer in circumstances like — in this

7

case.

8

MR. COME:

That is correct.

9

QUESTION:

Even if a grievance has been filed,

10

it has been rejected by the employer, and then the

11

Union refuses to carry it any further, the Board regularly

12

does not defer.

13

agrees to take it to arbitration and that proceeding

14

is not completed, then it will defer.

15

10
17

Whereas, if it goes to — If the Union

But now if there is an arbitrator's decision
there against the employee, what then?
MR. COME:

Well, the Board will look to see

18

whether that complies with the Spielberg criteria,

19

whether or not the procedure was fair and regular,

20

whether the determination is consistent with the polices

21

of the Act and whether the arbitrator, in fact, decided

22

the statutory issue.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

So, they sort of sit in review

of the arbitrator?
MR. COME:

Well, not to determine his fact

findings, redetermine his fact findings.
However, the issue before the Board and the

3

arbitrator is not necessarily the same as the Second

4

Circuit pointed out in the Interboro case which was

5

the first performance of this Doctrine.

6

is enforcing the contract.

7

Interboro is to protect the employee's right to make

8

a contract claim and in order to encourage the employee

9

to exercise his rights under the contract, the Board

The arbitrator

What the Board does under

10

merely requires a good faith, reasonable assertion

11

of that right, because otherwise, as Judge MacKinnon

12

pointed out in the Banyard case, which is cited in

13

our brief, employees would be discouraged from asserting

14

their contract rights except in the clearest cases.

15

So that Interboro, in effect, gives through Section

16

7, a little more than a contract does in order to ensure

17

that what the employees bargained for under the contract

18

they really get.

I would like to save the rest of my time
for rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

24
25

MR. UFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

18
ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Regarding the factual background of this

1

2

matter, it is Respondent's position that four facts

3

clarify the very narrow scope of the issues presented

4

by this case.
First, Mr. Brown did not warn or attempt

5

6

to warn any other employees of the alleged unsafe condition

7

of the truck.

8

made no bulletin-board message, he simply went home,

He made no verbal communication, he

\

9

having never inspected the truck or driven the truck

10

for over a year prior to the morning he refused to

11

drive.

12

QUESTION:

I thought he was told to go home.

13

MR. UFER:

His final instruction by both

14
15

17

supervisors —
QUESTION:

His preliminary instruction, he

was told to go home.
MR. UFER:

There was some confusion in the

18

record as to that point, Justice Blackmun.

19

instruction, which Respondent submit is a binding instruction

20

upon that employee, was to drive the truck and he refused

21

to drive the truck.

22

His final

As indicated on the dismissal sheet which

23

is in the Joint Appendix, he was discharged for disobeying

24

orders (refusing to drive Truck 244.)

25

QUESTION:

Well, we don't have to decide

here, do we?

2
3

MR. UFER:

No, that is not an issue before

the Court at this time.

4

Continuing with the facts about Brown, Brown

5

did not ask for his Union steward or seek Union assistance

6

of any nature on the morning of May 14th when he refused

7

to drive the truck.

8

that truck the same morning without incident and the

9

following two days the truck was driven on its regular

10

In fact, another employee drove

shift.

11

The fourth factual point that we believe

12

is of critical importance in this case is that all

13

the parties had agreed to binding grievance arbitration

14

as the collective bargaining agreement dispute resolution

15

procedure.

16

Now, against this factual background, both

17

the Board and the Sixth Circuit found individual action

18

by Brown and the Board seeks to utilize the fiction

19

of constructive concerted activity under the Interboro

20

Doctrine to bring an individual employee's refusal

21

to perform assigned work within the scope of Section

22

7 and to activate the Board machinery to resolve a

23

collective bargaining agreement dispute.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, would you — I take it you

wouldn't be here if Brown had said I won't drive the

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

truck because of the brakes and because I have a right

2

under the contract not to drive a truck with bad brakes.

3

Then, if he was ordered to drive and he refused —

4

MR. UFER:

If he articulated — If the reason

5

for his dismissal was the articulation of the grievance,

6

that is correct.

7

indicated that in our brief.

8
9
10
11

We would not be here and we have

In this case, the reason for his dismissal
was the refusal to drive the truck, not to the submittal
of the grievance.
QUESTION:

The submittal of the grievance came —
Are you on firm ground so far

12

as the findings by the Administrative Law Judge and

13

the Board are concerned?

14

Judge find the facts as you say they are?

15

MR. UFER:

Did the Administrative Law

The indication — The Administrative

16

Law Judge's opinion is that Brown was discharged for

17

refusing to follow a company order.

18

holding by the Administrative Law Judge that he was

19

discharged for filing a grievance.

20
21

QUESTION:

There is not a

I read it over and I frankly was

confused as to which of those it was.

22

MR. UFER:

I think —

23

QUESTION:

Wasn't he — Isn't it clear though

24

that he refused to work — He refused to work because

25

of his concern about the brakes and that the Board

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

and the Administrative Law Judge found that he was

2

exercising a contract right in refusing to do so?

3

MR. UPER:

The Board — It is our position

4

that the Board does not — The arbitrator has provided

5

for — Under the collective bargaining agreement, the

6

arbitrator is to make a decision as to whether or not

7

Brown's conduct was justified when he refused to drive

8

the truck under Section XXI of the collective bargaining

9

agreement.

10

In this case, we submit that what the Board

11

does, as indicated in its American Freight decision,

12

it will come in and apply a lesser standard, essentially

13

subjective, good faith standard, not the standard determined

14

and agreed upon by the parties to the contract.

15

And, for that reason, we don't believe the

16

Board made that determination or had the right to make

17

that determination.

18

We respectfully submit that Section 7 of

19

the National Labor Relations Act should be interpreted

20

by this Court according to it plain meaning.

21

this is consistent with the legislative history.

22

QUESTION:

We believe

But, the point you just made wouldn't

23

be foreclosed even if it were found that what he was

24

exercising was a collective right.

25

MR. UFER:

That is correct.

MR. UFER:

Both issues are raised in this

Counsel for the Board has indicated that we
It is our position

that in exception number one we specifically raised
the issue whether Brown's refusal to drive the work —
I believe the language that we utilized in that situation
was — We made the exception whether the charging party,
James Brown was engaged in concerted activity protected
by Section 7 of the Act when he refused to drive the
truck.
So, it is our position that both the protected
and the concerted issues are raised in this case and
under either ground there is no basis for an unfair
labor practice.

That is correct.

You can still argue that it would be

QUESTION:

You are defending the decision

below that this was not an exercise of a collective
right?
MR. UFER:

That is correct.

But, you are defending that position.

MR. UFER:

walked off the job.

had they simply walked off the job while the conduct
may have been concerted under Section 7, it would not
have been protected.

MR. UFER:

It was two days before.

QUESTION:

Because of its brakes?

MR. UFER:

Justice Marshall, two days before

there was almost an accident at the landfill, but the
driver of the truck at that time continued to drive
the subject truck and when he took it back to the mechanics,
the mechanics told him they would fix it over the weekend
or first thing Monday morning.

Mr. Brown came in after

having already made a run Monday morning.

He then

never went to the truck to make an inspection as required
by company policy.

24
25

Let me get back to the facts again.

which his truck the day before?

15

18

That is our position.

Is it admitted that this very truck almost had an accident

14

17

And, even if

Mr. Brown had been accompanied by five other employees,

13

10

That violates the no-strike cause

which is very broad in this contract.

10
11

We are definding that position.

QUESTION:

Is all of your answer yes to my

question?

MR. UFER:

All of my answer —

QUESTION:

The question is is that the same

truck that almost had an accident with him two days
before?
MR. UFER:

It was the same truck.

QUESTION:

Your answer is yes.

MR. UFER:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question while

we have got you interrupted?

Just on the issue of

concerted activity, putting aside all the protected
questions, and you made reference to the plain language
of the statute, you would agree, as I understand it,
that if he had been discharged for filing a grievance
without regard to its merits that that would be covered
by the Act and that would be a concerted activity?
MR. UFER:

If that was the motivation for

his discharge, that is correct.
QUESTION:

How is that — Why is that any

more concerted than what was involved here just looking
at the requirement of joint action?
MR. UFER:
spoken to that issue.

I don't believe this Court has
A number of circuit courts that

have spoken to that issue have found the submittal
of a grievance, the formal submittal of a grievance
to be concerted and they may have gone on the ground

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that policy considerations, that that furthers the

2

grievance arbitration procedure and dispute resolution

3

mechanism.

4

QUESTION:

But, you are prepared to assume

5

for purposes of your argument that that individual

6

action is "concerted" within the meaning of the Act?

7

MR. UFER:

A formal assertion of a contract

8

violation and the formal grievance, if the motivation —

9

and we would, under the analysis this Court set forth

10

in Bernhart and Sims, if the motivation is the submittal

11

of that grievance and not the underlying —

12
13

QUESTION:

Now you are focusing on the employer's

motivation —

14

MR. UFER:

That is correct.

15

QUESTION:

— in order to decide whether

16
17

the employee's action was concerted.
MR. UFER:

That is correct.

In order to

18

constitute an unfair labor practice, you need in the

19

first instance —

20
21

22

QUESTION:

I understand that, but I am just

interested in the word "concerted" at this point.
MR. UFER:

Fine.

We are conceding that a

23

formal grievance submittal, that act in and of itself,

24

is concerted.

25

QUESTION:

So once you make that concession —

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

I find it hard to accept your plain language argument.
That is the reason I want tdobe sure I understood you correctly.

MR. UFER:

We think there is some kind of

4

contradiction in that regard.

5

difficulty.

6

We acknowledge that

In the face of the circuit cour : decisions,
.

7

I think, again, they went under the policy considerations

8

to promote the grievance and to make sure there isn1t

9

a chilling effect of the access to grievance and they

10

indulge — I think possibly you might under the Mushroom

11

Transportation test, where you are preparing for or

12

inducing concerted activity, that that explains a grievance

13
14
15
16

situation or very possibly a grievance situation could
be explained under the assisting labor organizations,
the .earlier language in Section 7 of the Act, and that
it does not have to go —

in time.

There was a grievance subsequent

I believe it was filed the next morning.

It is very clear in this case —
QUESTION:

So, again, why would his assertion

be any less concerted than an actual grievance?
MR. UFER:

We believe that in that situation,

QUESTION:

3

In these facts, when he was fired,

there was no grievance?

4

MR. UFER:

That is correct.

5

QUESTION:

But, he was asserting the very

6

right that they filed a grievance over.
MR. UFER:

7

The record is clear that there

8

is no reference whatsoever to the collective bargaining

9

agreement by Mr. Brown.

There is simply a confrontation

10

between Mr. Brown and his supervisor where his supervisor

11

is instructing him to drive the truck and Brown is

12

saying he does not want to drive the truck and that

13

the truck is unsafe.

14

term or section of the collective bargaining agreement.

15

There is no mention of the word "grieve" or even the

16

term "collective bargaining agreement," nor does he

17

ask for his Union steward or for an Union official.

18

And, in that case we would distinguish this situation

19

from a formal grievance for those reasons.

There is no reference to any

QUESTION:

When did he refuse to drive the

22

MR. UFER:

On the morning —

23

QUESTION:

When he refused in the evening,

20
21

24

why didn't that give rise to a grievance right then

25

and there even without waiting until the following

2

the shop steward?

3

MR. UFER:

business agent or

I believe, in fact, he made contact

4

with his shop steward and came in that afternoon.

5

And, what we are saying, to come within the protection

6

of Section 7, an employee has got to afford the employer

7

some notice as to what it is that he is doing besides

simply stating —

Should he drive the truck in the

11
12

meantime.

13

if he does not drive the truck — If he makes the uni­

14

lateral, individual determination not to drive the

15

truck, then he has either got to come within the justified

16

language set forth in the collective bargaining agreement

17

as found by the Union and ultimately an arbitrator

18

to excuse his refusal or he must come within the standard

19

in Section 502 of the National Labor Relations Act

20

where Congress spoke specifically and established a

21

standard where an individual employee can refuse to

22

undertake a job assigment.

23

a higher standard of abnormally dangerous condition

24

in an objective showing as this Court indicated in

25

the Gateway Coal decision.

He has — It is Respondent's position that

QUESTION:

The only way that I could be protected,

because I drive an automobile, from a truck with no
brakes is for a man to go on and drive it.
MR. UFER:

I believe what he would have to

do is make a showing —
QUESTION:

I think you said a minute ago

that his only way was he would have to drive the truck
and I am sure you didn't mean that.
MR. UFER:

What I meant to say, Justice Marshall,

is that if he does not drive the truck, if he makes
that determination, then he does so at his peril and
he must be vindicated by the arbitrator.

And, if the

arbitrator finds —
QUESTION:

If he knows the truck has no brakes,

he has to drive it?
MR. UFER:

He has to — There has to be —

QUESTION:

On the road with me?

(Laughter)
MR. UFER:

He has to make —

QUESTION:

If you want me to make that ruling,

I am not going to make it.
MR. UFER:

Justice Marshall, what I would

want in this case would be consistent with company
policy that if he is going to refuse to drive the truck
at a minimum he inspect the truck to ascertain whether

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

or not it has been fixed.
In this case, it is company policy to inspect

2
3

the truck and it is clear from the record he never

4

went anywhere near the truck nor had driven the truck

5

for a year prior to his refusing to drive it.

driver drove that same truck without incident later

7

that morning.

So, in that setting, we are stating that

the dismissal was justified.

12

to what repairs had been made over the — in that interval?

MR. UFER:

QUESTION:

Then what should the Administrative

Justice.

16

Law Judge do, treat that as a presumption that the

17

condition had remained unchanged from Friday night

18

until Monday morning?

19

MR. UFER:

I think, consistent with the Union

20

determination that the grievance didn’t have merit,

21

that the substantial evidence in this case would indicate

22

that where he does not inspect the truck, contrary

23

to company policy, and where the truck is that same

24

morning driven by another employee without incident,

25

I think in that situation that the logical inference

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

and reasonable inference is that the truck had been

2

repaired, but the record is silent as to that point.

3

QUESTION:

Then the case comes down to whether

4

or not this was a contumacious refusal even to determine

5

the facts.

6

employee was guilty of that kind of conduct?

Is that the position of the employer, this

7

MR. UFER:

8

We believe, returning to the definition of

9

concerted, looking to the legislative history of the

That is correct.

10

National Labor Relations Act, did Congress indicate

11

anything that would indicate something other than a

12

plain meaning interpretation of concerted.

13

there is nothing to that effect.

14

Congress spoke in two important regards that support

15

a plain-meaning interpretation in this case.

16

We submit

On the contrary,

In proposed Section 8(a)(6) in the Taft-Hartley

17

amendment, Congress considered and specifically rejected

18

this section 8(a)(6) which would have made an employer's

collective bargaining agreement contract violation

22

considered and rejected when it adopted Section 8(a)(6).

In the C & C Plywood case, before this Court

3

which involved the unilateral company implementation

4

of a premium pay plan during the terms of a collective

5

bargaining agreement, this Court reviewed the Section

8(a)(6) legislative history and specifically concluded

7

that Congress had not given the Board the broad generalized

8

jurisdiction to determine the rights of parties under

9

all collective bargaining agreements, that Congress

10

has specifically chosen to leave collective bargaining

11

agreement enforcement to the usual processes of law

12

under Section 301.

from within this very same Act.

21

Faced with a problem of the Act's plain meaning
and the legislative history surrounding Section 502
and proposed Section 8(a)(6) —
QUESTION:

As I understand the Court of Appeals,

it said that even if Brown was exercising a right under
the contract, he wasn't exercising a right protected
by Section 7, because he was doing it just for his
own account.
MR. UFER:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Only for himself.

MR. UFER:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Now, do you defend that?

MR. UFER:

We do.

QUESTION:

Suppose you are wrong on that.

We believe —

Suppose we disagreed with you on that narrow ground
which is the ground of Court of Appeals relied on.

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Shouldn't we send it back?

2

MR. UFER:

We believe in this case it is

3

established in the record that his action, if it were

4

found to be concerted, it is nevertheless not protected

5

in that it is a violation of the no-strike clause also.

That may be, but you are now defending

MR. UFER:

QUESTION:

I suppose that issue was

before the Court of Appeals.

15

MR. UFER:

We believe it was and the Court

16

of Appeals, when it expressed its complete agreement

17

with the Kohls decision of the D.C. Circuit, we believe

18

that that incorporated the protection argument and

win the case in the long run on two or three other
grounds that you have already argued.

4

the legislative history, the Board turns to a different
5

argument and asserts that the Court should defer to
6

its interpretation.

We would simply like to point

7

out in this regard that in the Weingarten decision
8

of this Court, the Court indicated that it should not
9

step aside and rubber stamp the Board's determinations
10

that run contrary to the language and the tenor of
11

the Act.
12

13

Similarly, in the
Edward DeBartolo Corporation
\
decision earlier this spring, a decision interpreting

14

Section 8(b)(4), the publicity proviso and the distri­
15

bution requirements provided therein, this Court expressly
16

did not allow the NLRB to apply so generous a standard
17

as to strip the statutory restriction from the Act.
18

If Congress had intended that broad a scope,
19

they would not have placed the restriction in the Act
20

in the first instance.
21

We submit that the Board is doing precisely
22

this thing with the Interboro Doctrine.

They are asking

23

the Court to step aside and rubber stamp their determina­
24

tion and that determination is utilizing a standard
25

so generous as to strip the concerted requirement from

2

Section 7.
We would also like to point out that the

3

policy underlying deference to the Board as was articu­

4

lated in Weingarten was to allow the Board to construe

5

the statute in light of changing patterns of industrial

6

life, yet the most significant changing pattern here

7

is the imergence of binding arbitration as a favored

8

dispute resolution procedure, to utilize self-government

9

in the work place through grievance arbitration.

10

The Interboro Doctrine flies in the face

11

of this fundamental emerging pattern of industrial

12

life and we submit for that reason it is not appropriate

13

to afford the Board any deference in its determination.

14

Policy considerations, we would respectfully

15

submit, also do not justify a departure from a plain­

18

meaning interpretation of concerted.

17

it is clear the Interboro Doctrine frustrates and does

18

not serve fundamental national labor policies.

19

We submit that

Addressing specific labor policies, the need

20

for certainty is of critical importance in labor relations

21

to maintain and promote industrial stability, particular

22

in situations of employee discharges and potential

23

work stoppages.

24
25

Yet, the Interboro Doctrine kept all of the
parties, including the employees, adrift on a sea of total

uncertainty.

Board's Interboro decisions over the past few years

3

to appreciate the magnitude of this uncertainty.

4

It takes only a cursory review of the

decisions.

7

the employer committed an unfair labor practice by

8

enforcing his contract right as affirmed by the arbitrator.

9

The arbitrator in that case concluded there was no

11

well, we apply a lesser standard and they found an

14

QUESTION:

Do you cite that in your brief,

Mr. Ufer, American Freight?

15

MR. UFER:

We do.

16

QUESTION:

Was it NLRB versus American Freight?

17

MR. UFER:

That is correct.

18

There are similarly conflicting and contradictory

19

Board decisions.

to the very recent Board decision in Comet Fast Freight.

We would direct the Court's attention

It is a truck

to any other employees, and, in fact, another employee

2

in each one of these cases drove the truck that very

3

same day.

Yet the Board reached opposite legal con­

4

clusions.

They found there was no concerted activity

5

in Comet Fast Freight.

6

This Comet Fast Freight decision would seem

7

to invite inquiry by this Court of the Board's counsel

8

whether the NLRB has recently changed its position

9

on Interboro, whether the Board has stepped back from

10

Interboro.

11

its position or its application of the doctrine is

12

totally inconsistent.

13

We would submit either the Board has changed

Similarly, the Yellow Fast Freight Board

14

decision which is another recent Board decision that

15

is cited in the Board's reply brief is also hopelessly

16

contradictory with earlier precedent.

17

there was an individual employee's refusal to drive

18

the truck and it was only a momentary refusal, engaging

19

for some 15 to 20 minutes with his supervisor as to

20

whether or not his driving a truck would violate the

21

contract term relating to safety.

22

In that case,

The Board concluded that that conduct con­

23

stituted insubordination and, therefore, not protected

24

25

That conduct is lesser conduct than in the

doesn't perforin the work at all.

2

We would submit that another fundamental

3

uncertainty arises from the Interboro Doctrine in that

4

it denies all of the parties their agreed-upon, substantive,

5

contract term.

6

of the contract because the Board is stepping in and

7

applying, as in American Freight — It specifically

8

indicates it is applying a lesser substantive safety

9

standard.

10

It essentially makes mincemeat out

We further submit with respect to uncertainty

11

that there are inordinate delays that compound the

12

uncertainty in this whole area where the Board intervenes.

13

In collective bargaining agreements, there

14

is often specific time frames provided for the grievance

15

procedure and ultimately arbitration.

16

Using this case as an example, the Board

18

decision was not reached until over two years after

19

the incident occurred and with the appeals through

20

the court there is even greater delay.

21

Turning to other policy considerations which

22

we believe are of vital important, Interboro creates

23

an entirely duplicative procedural structure for

24

collective bargaining agreement dispute resolution

25

with all of the attendant time, uncertainty and expense

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

of duplication.
QUESTION:

Well, it is an old story though

3

that the Board will or will not find something an unfair

4

labor practice even though it may or may not violate

5

the contract.

6

MR. UFER:

That is correct.

7

QUESTION:

Isn't that right?

8

MR. UFER:

That is correct.

9

QUESTION:

And also, even if some arbitrator

I think —

10

has held that it is not a violation of the contract,

11

the Board isn't necessarily foreclosed.

12

MR. UFER:

That is correct.

13

QUESTION:

You acknowledge that?

14

MR. UFER:

We acknowledge that.

We believe

15

the qualitative distinction with respect to the Interboro

16

Doctrine is that it transforms all collective bargaining

17

agreement disputes into unfair labor practices.

18

QUESTION:

How would you sort them out?

19

MR. UFER:

I would return to an actual plain

20

meaning interpretation of concerted is our position,

21

and, if, in fact, there are two or more employees under­

22

taking an action or agreeing upon a course of action —

23

QUESTION:

So, you would say the Board could

24

never second guess an arbitrator if all the employee

25

ever was doing was asserting his own right.

MR. UFER:

The Board — I think the correct

standard for the Board's intervention in that case
would be the Spielberg Doctrine of fairness and reason­
able .
QUESTION:

Well, why — He doesn't mention

another employee or anything else.
back, he wants back pay.
MR. UFER:

He wants his job

Why is that concerted?

It is our position that would

not be concerted.
QUESTION:

Even if the arbitrator — Even

if it had gone to arbitration.
MR. UFER:

I think the clarification in that

regard — The first position is that the action would
not be concerted by the individual, and the second
position would be it would be appropriate for deferral
to the arbitrator.

And, I think on either of those

two grounds the employer's conduct could be affirmed.
QUESTION:

But then why did you concede at

the beginning that a grievance filed by a single employee
is concerted?
MR. UFER:

We don't — In light of the Circuit

Court decision on that point, we believe that there
is an argument to be made to that effect, but again —
QUESTION:

That just flies in the face of

your plain meaning.

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

MR. UFER:

That is correct and if I made

2

that concession, then very possibly I ought to retreat

3

from that, because I think a plain meaning interpretation

4

offers certainty into this situation and that it is —

5

QUESTION:

You should retreat from your sug­

6

gestion that Spielberg is enough protection for your

7

provision is an individual grievance has gone to

8

arbitration.

9

MR. UFER:

I believe that is a separate issue

10

and those standards, as they have more recently evolved

11

in Board decisions, I think there has been a distortion

12

and a perversion of the Spielberg Doctrine.

13

But, focusing on Spielberg for a moment,

14

what we would submit the Board can determine is that

15

if the discharge is for — If the affected employee

16

is contending that discharge is because he is the Union

17

organizer or he is the Union steward and the employer

13

is saying that he is discharged for failure to do his

19

job duties or to obey an instruction, then there can

20

be a Board review to undertake that motivational analysis.

21

But, as to whether or not he is doing his job, which

22

is the issue in this case, we would submit that there

23

is no position for the Board to make that determination.

24

We respectfully submit that the concerted

25

standard expressly set forth in Section 7 should be

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

defined according to its plain meaning.

2

this is consistent with the legislative history and

3

we also believe it is consistent with this Court's

4

precedence defining the scope of protected activities

5

under Section 7 in other circumstances and the basic

6

labor principle set forth in those precedents, the

7

labor principles of majortarianism, of not allowing

8

an individual to control the entire process and to

9

control the collective bargaining agreement administra­

10

We believe

tion, the precedence of presumption of arbitrability.

time and then you answered Justice 01 Connor another

way and now you have returned to your first position.

You would say that is concerted

I believe the analysis should

be an actual concerted analysis and if it is found

that the conduct between the individual and his Union

steward in the filing of that grievance could constitute

In the first place, I would like to make

clear that our position is not that every violation
