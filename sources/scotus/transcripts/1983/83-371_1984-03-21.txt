CRAL ARGUMENT OF ALEERT G. LAUBER, JR., ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF CF PETITIONEES
MR. LAUBER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case arose out of a multinational

11

12

telecommunications conference held in Dublin, Ireland,

13

in 1979.

14

representatives of six European nations, of Canada, and

15

by three members of our Federal Communications

16

Commission.

That conference was attended by

Respondent ITT believes that the three

17
18

attending Commissioners had engaged at Dublin in certain

19

discussions that were hurtful to ITT's financial

20

interest.

21

attending Commissioners had tried to encourage their

22

European counterparts to enter into operating agreements

23

with two American companies that the FCC had recently

24

authorized to compete with ITT in the Atlantic market.

25

In particular, ITT suspected that the three

Accordingly, ITT launched a three-pronged

attack designed to prevent such discussions from

2

happening again.

3

with the FCC challenging the authority of the attending

4

Commissioners to take part in the kind of discussion

5

held in Dublin and seeking the promulgation of rules to

6

govern any future multinational conferences if any were

7

in fact held.

First, it filed a rulemaking petition

Secondly, ITT filed a complaint in the

8

district court which also challenged the authority cf
10

the Commissioners to take part in the kinds of

11

discussions held in Dublin and which sought declaratory

12

and injunctive relief against such asserted ultra vires

13

conduct in the future.
And third, in a different count of the

14
15

district court complaint, ITT contended that the Dublin

16

gathering and other European gatherings were meetings of

17

the FCC within the meanina of the Sunshine Act and that

18

those gatherings therefore had to be open to the

1

European public and be governed by all cf the other

20

procedural requirements that the Sunshine Act imposes.
The case as it comes here presents two

21
22

questions.

The first concerns the jurisdiction of the

23

district court to entertain ITT’s charge that the

24

Commission had engaged in ultra vires conduct.

25

second question concerns the proper construction of the

Well, that may depend on what the

But since the Commission

intends to have future consultations, I think the

problem is likely to arise again.
I would like to address the jurisdictional

23
24

question very briefly first.

Our position here is that

25

the district court had no jurisdiction to consider ITT's

charass of ultra vires conduct by the Commission,

2

because ITT had already submitted that same ultra vires

3

argument to the Commission in its petition for

4

rulema king.
The Commission considered that ultra vires

5

6

charge in denying the petition for rulemaking.

7

denial was a final order of the FCC and under Section

8

402(a) of the Communications Act exclusive jurisdiction

9

to review that final order lay in the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION;

Do you say the district court would

11

have had no jurisdiction, Nr. Lauber, even had the ITT

In our view, upon a proper construction of the

Sunshine Act the district court was required as a matter

10

of law to award summary judgment to the FCC on either of

11

these two independently sufficient grounds.

12

First, then, as to the authorization to act

13

requirement.

14

who attended these European gatherings were not a quorum

15

of the full Commission.

16

Commission had seven members, so a quorum was four.

17

However, at no time did more than three members of the

18

Commission attend the consultative process.

19

All parties here agree that the members

At all relevant times, the

However, those three attending members were

20

members and a quorum of a subdivision of the Commission ,

21

that is, the Telecommunications Committee.

22

therefore is whether that committee, those three

23

attending members, were authorized to act on behalf of

24

the Commission at the European sessions.

I will now explain what we

How, in order to define whether or not the

8

three attending members were in fact authorized to act

9

on behalf of the entire body in Europe, one must turn to

10

the organic statute that created the FCC, the

11

Communications Act.

12

statutes, has a provision which empowers the FCC to

13

delegate its authority, either to panels of

14

Commissioners, to individual Commissioners, to boards of

15

employees, or to single employees.

That statute, like most such

16

The Communications Act provides that such a

17

delegation of authority can be made only by published

18

rule or by order.

19

or order can be adopted, modified, or rescinded only by

20

a majority vote of the full Commission.

21

It further provides that such a rule

Now, in fact the FCC by rule has delegated a

great deal of authority to various groups and

individuals within the Commission.

Accordingly, in our view it’s perfectly plain

because the Commissioners had not

8

D.C. Circuit hypothesized that the FCC, in violation of

9

the Communications Act, had made a sub rosa delegation

Bather, the

10

of authority, not evidenced by a published rule or

11

order,

to the three attending Commissioners.

12

The court below based this hypothesis entirely

13

upon inference, an inference it drew from the facts that

14

the attending Commissioners went to Europe in their

15

official rules and that they there discussed matters

16

that were important to the FCC.

17

In our view,

this reasoning is just plain

18

wrong.

First of all, we knew of no authority for the

19

proposition that an agency, in the face of an explicit

20

delegations of powers provision in its statute, can

21

somehow delegate authority in any other way.
QUESTION:

22

Is there any authority to hold

23

meetings outside of the continental limits of the United

24

States?

25

the place that they must meet?

Is there anything, as with courts, that fixes

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. LAUBERi

1

I'm not sure, Mr. Chief Justice.

2

I believe that there is something in the statute of the

3

FCC which requires that it normally meet in Washington,

4

D.C.

elsewh ere.

I'm not aware if panels could conduct activities

QUESTION i

6

It would be somewhat unusual, would

7

it not, for a regulatory agency to hold meetings to take

8

action in Dublin or Paris or Rome?
MR. LAUBEB;

9

I think it would be unusual, tut

10

I am not sure whether there is any express provision

11

mandating that they hold meetings in the continental

12

U.S.

13

But we will try and find out before the reply.
Secondly, the second reason the unofficial

14

delegation theory will not work, is that the assumption

15

of an illegal delegation by the court below was wholly

16

contrary to the presumption of regularity that normally

17

is accorded administrative action.

18

Thirdly, the Court of Appeals' theory we think

19

proves too much.

It has no limiting principle.

If

20

unofficial delegation can be inferred in the absence of

21

an explicit delegation, a meeting could be held to be

22

held whenever members of an agency go somewhere in their

23

official roles and talk about important business.

24

would apply to seminars, lectures, trade group meetings,

25

and all the rest of it.

1

Mr. Lauber, what dees it mean when

2

you use the term "go somewhere in their official role"?

3

Does that mean they’re getting paid for transportation

4

and par diem?
MR. LAUBER;

5

Well, I think that’s what the

6

Court of Appeals must have meant, that they were going

7

on Government time; they were being invited because of

8

who they were, i.e., Commissioners, not tourists or the

9

like;

10

and that they were there because they were

Commis sioners.
The Europeans wanted them there as

QUESTION;

15
10

The whole process grew out of

Well, what does it mean to be

somewhere as a Commissioner?
MR. LAUBER:

17

I guess it means to be somewhere

18

and be able to speak with some authority about the

19

Commission’s interests and objectives, what it hopes to

20

accomplish.

21

that they were attending in their official roles.

MR. LAUBER.

3

If you didn't know what it meant?
— that the whole — it wasn't

down there, but —

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. LAUBEBs

Because it was clear that the

6

Europeans wanted the Commissioners there because they

7

were Commissioners and because they had some kind of

8

authority to speak about what was important.

9

weren't just commentators cr lecturers or scholars.

They

10

They were part of the American Government bureaucracy.

11

And the Europeans in the past have been frustrated

12

because they would cut a deal with a carrier and the

13

Commission would come in and veto it, and they didn't

14

like not knowing what was going on.
They wanted to meet the Commissioners and talk

15
16

to them personally.

17

QUESTIONS

18

(Laughter. )

19

MR. LAUBERs

And cut a deal with them, too.

A fourth problem with the Court

20

of Appeals' theory we think is that it will make it

impossible to administer the Sunshine Act as Congress

intended.

2

open or closed to the public.
Congress therefore, we think, must clearly

have presumed that -QUESTION :

5

Nr. Lauber, that’s the question I

6

really

wanted to get at.

7

as to whether it will be open or closed to the public?
RR. LAUBEE:

8
9

Who makes that determination

Well, under the Sunshine Act it

requires the agency to vote by a majority vote whether

10

or not to close the meeting under one of the ten

11

exceptions under the Sunshine Act, and they must record

12

those votes, publish who voted how on the record within

13

a week, I think, after the votes are taken.
QUESTION:

14
15

But in these European meetings, who

makes the determination?
NR. LAUBER:

Well, they’ve never really been

AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

correct.

I think the record does show that it was the

2

FCC that requested that the Dublin session be closed

3

when discussion came around to the issue of new carriers

4

and services, and that the Europeans went along with

5

that.
Rut what I'm talking about is the power tc

6

7

effect this.

Congress clearly presumed that an agency

8

would be able to know ahead of time whether it was going

9

to have a meeting or not, and if the status of a

10

gathering as a meeting depends not on an objective

11

indicia of a delegation of authority by statute, but on

12

some appellate court's inference about whether

13

delegation had been illegally conferred, the agency can

14

never know ahead of time whether a gathering will be a

15

meeting or not.

16

Finally, we think that the Court of Appeals

17

theory would facilitate a great deal of harassment of

18

regulatory bodies by those who wish to frustrate the

19

administrative process.

20

And we think this would convert the

So for all these reasons, it is our contention

7

that the Court of Appeals was wrong in believing that

authorization to act on behalf of an agency can be

could infer authorization tc act here, the European

8

QUESTION;

9

HR. LAUBER;

Right, that’s correct.
Even though it is a meeting.
Now, here the meetings, if such

10

they were, were held on foreign soil, they were hosted

11

by foreign governments, they were chaired by foreign

12

officials, they were attended by foreign representatives

13

of foreign governments who outnumbered the attending

14

Commissioners and equaled them in rank.

15

We think it is quite clear here that the

16

attending Commissioners were in no position to decree

17

that the meetings be governed by U.S. law or be open to

18

the public.

19

meetings open to the public and governed by U.S. law, as

20

well they might, the Commissioners would be forced to

21

have in effect a Hobson’s choice;

the meeting or to go and violate the Sunshine Act.

MB. LAUBERi

What the remedies are, in

district court you can get an injunction enjoining

9

compliance with the Act in the futute, and you can get

10

release of a transcript which would be required to be

11

made of a closed meeting if the Act were applicable.

12

And we think that to require the Commissioners

13

to either forego the meeting or go and violate the law

14

was not what Congress would have intended

15

enacted the statute, because the Act was meant to impose

16

procedural restraints on existing meetings, not to

17

impose substantive restrictions on agency action.

18

when it

Therefore, again, even if one were to assume

19

these were meetings, they were not meetings of the

agency because they were not controlled by the agency,

was dictated in favor of the Commission.

ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

2

4

LEWIS,

MR. LEWIS;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
Before addressing the FCC’s legal arguments,

6

there are a number cf additional facts that I think

7

should be called to the Court’s attention to put this

8

litigation in its proper context.

9

In the mid-1970*s there was a significant

10

disagreement between the FCC and representatives of

11

European governments as to the nature of the facilities

12

that should be constructed to handle the increasing

13

trans-Atlantic communications traffic.

14

FCC favored use of satellites,

15

favored the use of cable.

16

Basically, the

the European governments

As a result of the give and take of the

17

consultative process, meetings which had been going on,

18

the FCC basically agreed to defer to the Europeans and

19

authorized the construction of so-called TAT, for

20

trans-Atlantic, 7, the TAT-7 cable.

21

Now, at about the same time the FCC, which of

22

course for many years has sought to foster domestic

23

competition in the provision of communications services,

24

also sought to apply these policies to the international

25

arena and, in a significant departure from prior

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

practice, it authorized a number of new companies tc

2

provide international service, even though they had

3

never entered into agreements with the European

4

governments with which they would have to deal.
At about the time — and this is about the

5

6

same time.

At the time of

the TAT-7 decision,

7

authorizing TAT-7, Commissioner Fogerty, a key member of

8

the Telecommunications Committee of the Commission, the

9

committee charged with its express delegation of

10

authority with authorizing construction of major new

11

facilities, issued a concurring opinion.

12

the FCC was deferring tc the European governments even

13

though he didn't believe that a new cable was

14

approp riate.

He stated that

But he went on to say, we expect the tit for

15
16

the TAT, and specifically threatened that unless the

17

European governments agreed to deal with the new

18

American carriers the FCC would not listen to them in

19

the future.

forth in paragraph 8 of cur complaint.

This is October 1978.

In Inarch

The text is set

FCC.

But despite all this, when it came time for

6

the October 1979 consultative process meeting in Dublin,

7

not a single European government had backed down, not a

8

single European government had acceded to the FCC

demands.

But the district court jurisdiction is

The FCC basically elected not to join issue

6
7

with us on our statement of undisputed facts.

They

8

specifically represented to the court that there were no

9

material facts in dispute in the case, and that’s the

10

posture then in which the case arose and in which

11

summary judgment was granted.
The statements that we called to the court’s

12
13

attention, the district court and Court of Appeals, did

14

not shew general informal discussions, as the Commission

15

states in the question that it presented to this Court

16

when it asked that certiorari be granted.

17

statements clearly establish, to quote them, that the

18

Commission was in a negotiating stance, was seeking a

19

tit for TAT or a quid pro quo, that the Commission was

20

applying leverage on the European governments.

2

then,

3

Sunshine Act they claim should not apply.

4

urge that it has been correctly applied, recognizing

5

that the legislative history shows that there is to be a

6

presumption of openness in government and that the

7

burden of proof is on the administrative agency to

8

justify departure from those principles.

9

obviously, to the FCC's arguments as to why the
We of course

The first point the FCC argues is that, and we

10

all admit, no question, that there was not a quorum of

11

the FCC as it then existed, although in all likelihood

12

there will now — any future meeting involving the same

13

three Commissioners will of course involve a quorum of

14

the Commission as it now exists.

15

The Sunshine Act is clear that the FCC applies

16

-- excuse me, the Act applies,

not only to meetings cf

17

an agency, but to subdivisions of an agency that are

18

authorized to act cn behalf of the agency.

19

Commission's argument before this Court is that because

20

the Telecommunicaticns Committee was not expressly

21

authorized to participate in consultative process

22

meetings and because its authority was limited to

23

passing on applications for construction of major new

24

facilities, whatever it did was unauthorized and

25

therefore the Sunshine Act can't be applicable.

authority does Congress have over Dublin?

Your Honor, Congress is not

seeking to subject Dublin or any foreign administration

to the scope of the Sunshine Act.

All that Congress has

21

done is said that when the FCC engages in agency

22

business that it doesn't matter where they do it.

23

policies favoring openness in government are as

24

applicable in Dublin, if that's where the Commission

goes tc do its business and to get its business done.

7

even if they are involved in the joint conduct or

they did they didn't do at meetings of the FCC in

On the authorization to act requirement, ITT

would interpret the words "authorization to act on

Secondly, apropos of Justice Marshall's
