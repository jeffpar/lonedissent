ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
HR. RISSETTOs

10

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the Court, this case involves the application of

12

the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as it was amended tc

13

claims of employment discrimination on the basis of

14

handicap.

15

the essential facts that resulted in the petition for

16

cert being granted and being petitioned in this case.

I think it would be useful to briefly outline

Hr. IeStrange was employed originally by the

17
18

Erie Lackawanna Railroad in

1943 as an engine service

19

employee.

20

in 1973 — I’m sorry,

21

related injury, Hr. LeStrange suffered the loss of his

22

left hand and part of his left forearm.

23

subsequently disqualified from active employment on the

24

Erie Lackawanna by the medical department of the Erie

25

Lackaw anna.

He progressed from fireman to engineer, and
1971, as a result of a non-jet

Shortly afterwards, the Erie Lackawanna sought

2

the protection of the bankruptcy laws, and in 1976 the

3

properties, the rail properties of the Erie Lackawanna

4

were conveyed tc ConRail.

5

examined by a ConPail medical officer tc determine

6

whether he was qualified to be reinstated as a yard

7

service engineer on ConRail, and he was rejected.

A

8

complaint was filed under the Rehabilitation Act.

The

9

district court granted ConRail's motion for summary

In 1978, Mr. LeStrange was

10

judgment on that aspect of the complaint, and the United

11

States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.

12

The principal question in the case regards the

13

scope cf Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

It is

14

ConRail’s position that Section 504 applies only when

15

the primary objective cf the federal assistance is tc

16

provide employment.

17

primarily on the language of the statute, and it is —

18

and then that interpretation has also been adopted by

19

the United States Court of Appeals for the Second,

20

Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits.

That interpretation is based

Section 504 provides that no otherwise

21
22

qualified handicapped individual as defined in Section

23

7067 of this title shall solely by reason of his

24

handicap be excluded from, the participation in and be

25

denied

the benefits of, or be subjected to

1

discrimination under any program or activity receiving

2

federal assistance.

3

Section 504 as originally enacted had no

4

enforcement procedures.

In 1978, the statute was

5

amended by the addition of Section 505, which provided,

6

and this is the critical language in the case, that the

7

remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in Title 6 of

8

the Civil Rights Act shall be available to any person

9

aggrieved by any act or failure to act by any recipient

10

of federal assistance or federal provider of such

11

assistance under Section 794, which is Section 504 of

12

this title.

13

Thus, the incorporation of the Title 6

14

remedies raises the principal issue in the case.

15

incorporating Title 6,

16

procedures were incorporated and made applicable to

17

actions under Section 504?

18

interpretation of the statute that the rights, remedies,

19

and procedures contained in Title 6 include the

20

limitations and particular provisions set out in Section

21

604 of the statute.

what rights, remedies, and

It is ConFail's

Section 604 of Title 6 provides that nothing

contained in this title shall be construed to authorize

action under this title by any department or agency with

QUESTION;

Your opponents say that that wasn’t

discussed in Congress at any point.
MR. EISSETTO;

6

Are they correct?

That is correct. Your Honor.

7

Our interpretation is based on the plain language of the

8

statute. There is very little legislative history on

9

either side of the question, either with respect tc the

10

initial enactment of Section 503 —

11

QUESTION;

It is 3,000 pages.

12

MR. RISSFTT0;

There are 3,000 pages in the

13

Rehabilitation Act, and the Rehabilitation Act itself is

14

a lengthy statute dealing with a myriad of vocational

15

rehabilitation programs.

16

miscellaneous section, and there is scarcely a snippet

17

of legislative history that focuses on it.

The only explanation that I can

21

offer,

and it would be one by hypothesis rather than by

22

reference to the legislative history, is that Congress

23

understood what they meant in Title 6.

24

the coverage of Title 6, and they were simply

25

incorporating Title 6 into Section 504.

They understood

identical similarity in the language between Section 504

3

and Section 601 of Title 6, and in addition, when they

amended the statute in

remedies, and procedures of Title 6 to enforce Section

6

504.

Re believe that the legislative history cf

7
8

Sectiohn 601 itself, without even looking at Section 604

9

of the Act, supports an inference that Congress did not

10

intend

to regulate federal programs with respect to

11

employment practices, except where the federal program

12

had as its primary objective employment.
Whatever ambiguity may have existed in the

13
14

language of Section 601 as it was originally proposed

15

was rectified when Congress passed Section 604 of the

16

Act, which clearly prohibited or clearly limited the use

17

of Section 601 for employment discrimination, and with

18

respect to Section 604 and Section 601, there is some

19

legislative history, and the legislative history

20

supports a limiting interpretation of Section 601 and

21

604.

22

Now, in the North Haven case, dealing with the

23

third statute, that has language similar to Section 504

24

and Section 601, this Court considered whether or not

25

Title 9 of the Education Act amendments apply broadly to

7
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

all programs receiving federal assistance with respect

2

to employment discrimination on the basis of handicap,

3

or conversely, whether it applied narrowly only when the

4

primary objective of the program for assistance was to

5

provide employment, and they opted for the latter

6

interpretation of the statute,

7

decision was important, if not instrumental in the

8

decision of the court of appeals in this case.

9

and the Forth Haven

We believe that Title 9 and the North Haven

10

decision is inapposite for several reasons, the first of

11

which is that Title 9 has its own enforcement

12

procedures.

13

enforcement procedures set cut in Title 9 do not include

14

an analogue to Section 604.

It did not incorporate Title 6.

The

15

Secondly, during the legislative consideration

16

of Title 9 amendments, a provision identical or similar,

17

significantly identical to Section 604 was offered and

18

proposed in Congress and was rejected by Congress during

19

the conference on the legislation, so thus the court in

20

North Haven looked to the rejection of Section 604 as an

21

indication of a legislative intent to construe the Title

22

9 more broadly than Title 6 had been construed.

23

And finally, there was positive legislative

24

history identified in the Court’s opinion in North Haven

25

evidencing an intention to construe that statute more

8
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

broadly than Title 9.
In contrast, with respect to Section 504 of

2
3

the Rehabilitation Act, Title 6 does not — is

specifically incorporated in Section 504,

5

evidence that Congress intended or attempted to exclude

Section 604 from the rights, remedies, and procedures of

are to require the employer to present from considering

discrimination, allegations of handicapped

discrimination, when an employer considers an

5

application or a personnel action relating to a

6

handicapped employee, he is almost always forced, cr she

7

is almost always forced to focus on the handicap, the

8

nature of the handicap, because the statute itself

9

requires the protections of the Act to handicapped

10

persons who are otherwise qualified for employment.

11

Sc, in practice, when an employer considers,

12

as in the case of Mr. LeStranoe, whether Mr. LeStrange

13

is qualified to be a yard service engineer on ConRail,

14

he is not being asked to consider whether Mr. LeStrange

15

is qualified ether than the fact that he is missing a

16

portion of his left arm.

17

consider whether that handicap itself disqualifies Mr.

18

LeStrange from employment on CcnRail.

Rather, he is being asked to

employment discrimination, the program has to be related

would distinguish remedial legislation from legislation

Would you agree that those are

of Title 7.

They are in essence prospective in nature.

QUESTION;

That is the primary purpose

Then ycur definition cf remedial

10

really means something which grants a private cause cf

11

action to somebody.

12

KR. RISSETTO:

Nell, I think the remedy could

13

be provided by someone else having — a governmental

14

cause cf action could also be remedial in character.

15

Normally, private causes of action where the purpose is

16

to not ensure compliance with the statute, but to

17

vindicate and remedy the effects of a prior unlawful act

18

would be a remedial statute, and whether that action was

19

initiated by an employee or a person aggrieved or by the

20

United

States government on the employee's behalf, I

21

think,

is less important than the purpose of the cause

22

of action, and in this particular case, in the context

23

of Section 504, the purpose cf the legislation was to

24

ensure that federal funds were not expended in the

26

context of discrimination, that they weren't being used

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

by employers and by entities to discriminate on behalf

2

of handicapped individuals.

3

QUESTION;

Isn't this legislation parallel in

4

many ways to Title 9, where the Court in the Cannon case

5

found there was a private right of action, that it was

6

in effect remedial/ to use your terms, and how do you

7

distinguish the analysis that should be made here from

8

that?

9

MR. RISSETTO;

Well,

we believe that in the

10

Cannon case, that they recognized the private cause of

11

action, and as a result of this Court's recent decision

12

in the Guardians case under Title 6, we have conceded in

13

our reply brief that there is a private cause of action

14

under Title 6 -- under Title 6 and under Section 504, in

15

the context of a handicap discrimination complaint.

16

However, we believe that the purposes of the private

17

cause of action that are created should be consistent

18

with the funding purpose of the statute, and should be

19

designed to bring the employer into compliance, and that

20

the purposes of the statute and the legislative intent

21

can be achieved without awarding compensatory damages

22

and retrospective relief to a person who is aggrieved

23

under the terms of the statute, and that really is the

24

third argument, and the one that must necessarily be

25

reached by the Court in this case, because if the

13
AUJERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

complainant is not entitled to compensatory damages or

2

monetary relief under this Act, then the case is moot,

3

because there is no basis for injunctive relief under

4

the — because Hr. LeStrange has passed away.
So, we believe that a question that the Court

5

6

shouli consider is 'the propriety of monetary damages,

7

and that essentially is a question of legislative

8

intent.

9

Section 504?

10

What did the Court intend when they enacted
What did they intend when they adopted the

remedies --

11

QUESTION;

Do you mean Congress?

12

HR. RISSFTTO;

I am sorry.

Yes, Your Honor.

13

What did Congress intend when they applied or

14

incorporated the remedies contained in Title 6?
QUESTION;

15

wasn't even argued below, was it?

why did Congress add this?
HR. LENABANi

What Congress intended, and

7

actually it is explicit in the legislative history, was

8

that they wanted to codify existing HEW procedural

9

regulations and make also that remedy available to

10

handicapped individuals.

11

history is very clear.

12

enhance the remedies and rights of handicapped people,

13

and one of the ways they were going to enhance that was

to make available the rights, remedies, and procedures

Section 604 is neither a right, remedy, or

Turning once again very briefly to the

legislative history of the amendments to Section

QUESTION 4

14

Well, Hr. Lenahan, the gist of your

15

argument, I take it, and of the position taken by the

16

Third Cicuit, is that private rights of action to

17

enforce this discrimination against handicapped law are

18

more extensive than the agency's or department's

authority.

What is your response then?

MR. LENAHAN:

First, Your Honor, I think if

that assumption is made, in dealing with that

10

hypothetical we would have to say that it applies only

11

to an agency action, and that the private right of

12

action would exist anyway, which in our belief was

13

created back when 504 was originally enacted, and it is

14

only one of the remedies.

It is a

And as a matter of fact, the

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

rights of the handicapped, certainly not to limit them.

2

He would also direct the Court's attention to

3

the current regulations dealing with Section 504.

None

4

of these limit Section 504's employment coverage.

If

5

the Department of Transportation regulations are valid

6

and consistent with Section 504, these would prohibit or

7

prevent employment discrimination in all federal

8

programs within the purview of the Department of

9

Transportation.
Here it would be applicable to ConRail's

10
11

activities, even though these statutes, the Section — I

12

am sorry, the Department of Transportation regulations,

13

were enacted after this lawsuit was initiated, because

14

it is the law in effect that applies, as this Court held

15

in Eradley versus the School Board of Richmond case.
So, our position is that the current

16
17

regulations dealing with ConEail — these would be the

18

Department of Transportation regulations -- do not

19

include any type of 604 limitation.

As a matter of

20

fact,

There are 28 other

21

agencies, federal agencies which have regulations which

22

are consistent with not only 504 but with the DCT

23

regulations that I have just mentioned, and they all

24

provide for broad employment coverage.

25

they specifically exclude it.

This view of Section 504 is also supported by

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the Department of Justice and the Solicitor General.

2

Finally, and this is somewhat in response to

3

your question, Justice White, if Section 604 is

4

incorporated into Section 504, as the petitioner would

5

have, it would defeat the legislative scheme of Section

6

504.

7

the 1978 amendments alone is Section 604 mentioned.

8

Section 604 contradicts the actions and regulations of

Nowhere in 3/000 pages of legislative history of

29 federal agencies.

Section 604 in effect repeals

10

without any express language or intent the employment

11

coverage of Section 504.

12

QUESTION 4

It really isn't correct to speak of

13

Section 604 should be neglected because it is contrary

14

to the regulations of a group cf agencies.

15

perhaps one would question the regulations of the

16

agencies rather than the statute.
MR. LENAKAN*

17

I think

Your Honor, am I to understand

18

that these regulations that you are speaking of are not

1

to be given deference in this instance?

MR. LFNAHAN*

We don't feel, quite frankly,

that there is any basis to incorporate them, but if you

FOR UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. REYNOLDSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

3

please the Court, I have but a few minutes, and I

4

believe they can best be utilized by underscoring some

5

of the points made by Mr. Lenahan.

6

The issue here is one of statutory

7

construction.

Section 504 as enacted in 1973 prescribes

8

discrimination on account of handicapped in any program

9

or activity receiving federal financial assistance.

10

There is, as I understand it, no issue in this case

11

whether'the provision covers employment.

12

after North Haven there really could not be.

13

instead is how much employment activity is covered by

14

Section 504.

I suspect
The issue

15

The United States* position is that the 1973

16

Congress intended Section 504 to be every bit as broad

17

in its employment coverage as this Court found Title 9

18

to be in North Haven.

19

the Rehabilitation Act is aimed at enhancing employment

20

opportunities for physically and mentally handicapped

21

individuals.

22

defined in the statute in terms of employability, and

23

specific provisions were included in the Act to

24

encourage employment of the handicapped by the federal

25

government and by those contracting with the federal

The entire structure and focus of

govern ment

2

There is nothing in the language or the

3

history of Section 504 to suggest that Congress had more

4

modest ambitions for federally assisted programs. To the

5

contrary, the 93rd Congress in

6

employment discrimination on account of handicap in

7

Section 504 as comprehensively and indeed in virtually

8

the same terms as did the 92nd Congress in 1972, only a

9

year earlier, with respect to Title 9 insofar as it

1973 proscribed

10

covered employment discrimination on account of sex in

11

educational programs.

12

QUESTION;

So, Ur. Reynolds, the provision

13

then would re3cli employment in the programs, in the

14

appropriate program.

15

MR. REYNOLDS*

16

QUESTION;

That's correct.

Have you taken a position in this

17

case, or are you going to, as to what the program would

18

be if there are federal funds given to an entity on an

19

unrestricted basis that it could use for anything it

20

wanted to?

We have not in this case taken

QUESTION:

And if the only program that you

could identify in such an unrestricted grant is the

7

it wants to.

8

MR. REYNOLDS:

Right.

And you say it would include and it

is.

2

QUESTION;

Well, in which event the remand

3

would be sort of a -- I know you say that it ought to be

4

remanded to really define the program, but it would be a

5

rather hollow gesture if a good deal of this money is on

6

an unrestricted basis, and if it is, that means the

7

entire entity.

8
9

MR. REYNOLDS;

Well, I think that in the event

that there is, as the record now sits, I think that

10

certainly there would be a presumption that it would be

11

the entire entity.

12

presumption is irrebuttable, and certainly the entity

QUESTION;

14

Hew could it be rebutted with

15

respect to the money that goes to ConRail on an

16

unrestricted basis?
MR. REYNOLDS;

17

I don't know how it would be

18

rebutted.

If ConRail could demonstrate factually that

19

the alleged — that the claimant in this case was indeed

20

employed in a non-funded program, then it should have

21

the opportunity to that.

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. REYNOLDS;

I am not suggesting —

Kow could the program be unfunded?
I don't know where the funds

24

went or indeed how the security works in this case with

25

respect to the funding.

I am just saying,

I think that

38
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

certainly as the record now sits there is certainly the

2

likelihood that it would be the entire entity, and that

3

would be an appropriate definition.
QUESTION;

4

Hr. Reynolds, I am confused by your

5

use of the word "program.”

6

you.

7

otherwise qualified handicapped person shall be subject

8

to discrimination under any program or activity

9

receiving federal financial assistance or any under

10
11

Perhaps I don't understand

But as I read Section 504, it says that "No ether

program or activity conducted by any executive agency."
Kow, do you take the word "program" to mean

12

the program which ConEail conducts as a result of

13

receiving money, or the program is one that Congress or

14

the executive branch is conducting to fund entities?

15

HR. REYNOLDS;

I think the program has to be

16

defined by the funding statute, and therefore it would

17

be the program that the federal government is funding.

18

In the prior case,

19

the program that that funding statute defines, and if we

20

are talking about, in this case, either Title 5 money

9

It could be, yes.

I think

QUESTION;

Well, that is not the argument that

10

was made in the prior case, was it, Mr. Reynolds?

11

Wasn't the proposal taken by Mr. Bator something

12

different than that, in suggesting that the program was

13

one at the college, and was the administration of the

14

funds at the college?

15

It sounds to me different.

MR. REYNOLDS;

I am sorry.

I believe his

16

argument was that the program is defined by the federal

17

grant or the federal government's funding operation.

18

that case, it was a — the federal government is funding

19

scholarship aid, and the program that was defined by the

20

statute that we are dealing with in that case, and

21

therefore it was the federal -- it was the student aid

22

program. That is the one that is being funded by the

23

statute in question.

MR. REYNOLDS:

question that Mr. Justice Rehnquist had asked early in

the argument about the regulations and the statute and

I was about to answer a

10

the — which controlled, and the point I wanted to make

11

was that at the time that Congress amended the statute

12

in 1978, it had before it comprehensive HEW reoulaticns

13

that indeed set forth the procedure and the enforcement

14

mechanism that Congress intended to incorporate into the

15

statute by the

16

defined employment coverage in terms of the entire

17

funded program, and not in terms of the primary purpose

18

of the funding, and therefore when Congress amended the

19

statute to pick up and incorporate this regulatory

20

scheme, it did it with the regulations defining it as --

1

five minutes remaining.

2

HR. RISSETTO:

It was recently mentioned that

3

the HEW regulations were in existence in 1978, and

4

constitute enactment history.

5

the HEW regulations in the legislative history of the

6

1978 amendments appear on Page A16 of our petition for

7

cert,

8

decision, and it is a very small paragraph, and I would

9

like tc ask the Court if I could read it.

10

The critical reference tc

and are quoted as part of the court of appeals

"It is the Committee's understanding that the

11

regulations promulgated by the Department of Health,

12

Education, and Welfare with respect to the procedures,

13

remedies, and rights under Section 504 conform with

14

those promulgated under Title 6.

15

codifies existing practice as a specific statutory

10

requir ement."

17

Now,

Thus this amendment

that quoted portion could mean either one

18

or two things, that in fact there is no antagonism

19

between Title 6 and the HEW regulations, and I believe

20

there is — the evidence or the legislative history of

21

Title 6 and its applicability to employment is very

22

clear, or alternatively that the regulations are not in

23

conformity with the language of Title 6, and therefore

24

the report and the representation made to Congress in

25

the legislative history regarding the HEW regulations

Ke believe that the enactment legislative

history either supports ConRail's position that Title 6

does apply to Section 504 or that the references tc the

are misleading and should not be given weight by the

The second point I would like to make is one

narrow scope left a group of people, including public

employees and educational employees, without a remedy
