ORAL ARGUMENT OF EMMET J. BONDURANT, II, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. BONDURANT:

8

9

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Next summer we will observe the 20th anniversary

11

of the 1964 Civil Rights Act .

12

almost 19 years of the existence of that Act we are before

13

this Court to discuss the question of whether or not that

14

Act applies to sex discrimination in the private prac tice

15

of law in the most highly compensated , and outside the

18

judiciary, the most p r estigious positions of the legal

17

profession.

(Laughter)

3

MR. BONDURANT:

4
5

I don't think the Court was

misinformed as to the intent.
The lower courts in this case held that because

8

the Respondent was organized as a commonlaw partnership,

1

acts of discrimination, which the complaint alleges, were

8

practiced by that firm in the selection of partners were

II

outside the coverage of the Act.

10

Thus, even though the complaint specifically

11

alleged, and the lower courts accepted it as true, as, of

12

course, they must for purposes of ruling upon a motion t o

13

dismiss, that the firm engaged, pursuant to a 100-year

14

pattern and practice, of discrimination against women in

15

the selection of partners.

19

ruled that that discrimination was outside the coverage of

11

Title VII and that Title VII afforded the Petitioner no

18

remedy for that discrimination.

111

The lower courts nevertheless

An analysis of this case must begin, of course,

Nor is there is question in this case as to

2

whether or not Ms. Hishon, an associate for almost eight

3

years with the firm , was an employee of the firm .

5

She

The question in this case rather is whether or

8

not the particular acts of sex discrimination which the

7

complaint alleges were practiced by King & Spalding,

8

admittedly an employer, against Ms . Hishon, admittedly an

9

emp l oyee covered by the Act, were themse l ves unlawfu l

10
11
12
13

employment practices covered by Section 703 of the Act .
We believe that the answers to these questions
are in the affirmative.
First, let me point out by stating that the

14

Petitioner agrees with the position take n by the Sol i citor

15

General that it is really not essential in this case to

18

reach of the broade r question of whether or not the

17

partnership relationship; that is the relationship between

18

an individual partner and the institution itself is an

19

employment relationship.

20

For reasons that we have set forth in the brief,

21

we think an affirmative answer to that question is

22

indicated in this and other cases.

23

be decided on the narrower ground, that in her particular

24

position as an associate of the law firm, the opportunity

25

to be considered for partnership on a fair, equal, and

non-discriminatory basis was both a term, condition, and

2

privilege of her employment and employment opportunity,

3

both of which were explicitly within the protection of

4

Section 703 of the Act and were, when the firm practiced

5

sexual discrimination in making those decisions, were

8

unlawful employment practices within the meaning of the

T

Act.

8

The complaint clearly and specifically alleged

9

that the firm held out and represented to the Petitioner

10

and to all other associates whom it sought to recruit, the

11

opportunity for fair, non-discriminatory consideration for

12

partnership after completion of five or six years'

13

employment with the firm and hard and satisfactory work

14

during that period.

15

QUESTION:

18

MR. BONDURANT:

Did they all become partners?
No, Your Honor, they all did not

11

become partners.

18

and to other associates the opportunity to be so

19

considered and by holding out that opportunity the terms,

20

conditions, and privileges of her employment included the

21

opportunity for fair, non-discriminatory consideration for

22

partnership.

23

But, the firm held out to the Petitioner

When that was denied her, and that is what the

24

complaint alleges, that she was not given fair, non-

25

discriminatory consideration for partnership, the firm

Section 703, which is

4

QUESTION:

But, you would still be here if the

ultimate decision was that based on sex or race?

8

MR. BONDURANT:

8

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor .

So, consideration isn't what you are

7

really talking about I don't suppose .

You can consider

8

all you want to, but if the bottom line is you don 't get

9

into this partnership because of your sex, you would sti ll

10

be here making the argument, but you would have to say

11

that the selection of a partner may not be based on that.

12

13
14

15
18

MR. BONDURANT:

That is correct.

And, the

process of selection
QUESTION:

You are using too many words then.

You may not select partners based on sex or race.
MR. BONDURANT:

Certainly from among associates,

17

that is true.

18

were considering partners from the outside, but that is

19

not th is case.

20

We also believe that that is true if one

This case is strengthened by the fact that the
express representations of non- discriminatory

22

consideration were made and it is the opportunity for

23

advancement which every associate possesses in his or her

24

capacity as an employee of the firm which is and becomes

25

both an employment opportunity and a term, condition, or

7
llall'OlmNO eot#NN, INC.

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WAIHINOTON, D.C. 20001 ('-11:1) -

1

privilege of employment.

2

It does not make a difference that the position

3

of partnership is or is not itself within the coverage of

4

the Act, for in the labor cases, this Court has

5

recognized, as have the lower courts, that where a federal

6

statute applies, as in the labor cases, and is violated,

1

it, does not make a difference that the opportunity for

8

promotion is being withheld for an unlawful reason under

9

one of those statutes, even though the the position to

10

which the employee would have been promoted was entirely

11

outside the coverage of the Act.

12

Thus, in this case, the complaint specifically

13

alleged that she possessed in her position as an employee

14

the opportunity to be considered and be promoted to a

15

partner, that it was an opportunity for advancement, that

16

it was withheld on the basis of sex, and, therefore, is

11

plainly within the literal language of Section 703 of the

18

Act.

19

QUESTION:

So, if you win on that basis, if, in

20

hiring associates, the law firm says that we will make our

21

selection of partners unrestricted by the terms and

22

conditions of Title VII, would that get them off the hook?

23

24
25

MR. BONDURANT:

No, Your Honor, it would not.

If the firm -QUESTION:

Well then, it isn't a term and

condition of employment .

MR. BONDURANT:

3

QUESTION:

6

MR. BONDURANT:

7

I

think the firm will be covered by Section 703.

4

e

I disagree with Your Honor.

So, it is a legal term.
I am not sure what Your Honor

means by that.
QUESTION:

Well, I mean it is imposed by· the

e

operation of law, not by contract .

9

MR. BONDURANT:

It is imposed by the operation

10

of law, it is reinforced, whereas in this instance, the

11

complaint alleges that the firm explicity held out as an

12

inducement fair, non-discriminatory consideration for

13

partnership after five or six years of employment.

14

In our view, it would not make a difference if

15

the firm had been silent; that is if the firm's business

1e

practices are such that the firm regularly reviews its

11

associates and evaluates them for promotion to partnership

18

and does so on a basis that is prohibited by Title VII,

19

that would violated Title VII even if the firm were silent

20

in terms of representations it makes to an associate.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Bondurant, what part does the

22

representation by the firm play over and above what the

23

law otherwise requires?
Your Honor, it plays no part

24

MR. BONDURANT:

25

other than reinforcing th e notion.

2

QUESTION:

Well, if it plays no part, how can it

reinforce?

3

MR. BONDURANT:

Well, let me put it in this

4

sense.

We believe that if the firm were silent that it

5

would nevertheless be covered under Section 703 .

8

that the opportunity for advancement which one possesses

7

as an associate adheres in the relationship and that where

8

a firm regularly promotes associates to partnership from

9

that relationship, that that is an opportunity of the

That is

10

employment and an implicit term, condition, p r ivilege of

11

employment that could not be withheld on the basis of sex .

12

That case, we believe, becomes even stronger,

13

where to induce one to enter into the relationship in the

14

first instance, the firm holds out the opportunity for

15

nondiscriminatory consideration for emp l oyment after five

18

or six years.

17

If you were employed by a law firm and the law

18

firm said to you, we make no representations to you

19

whatsoever as to non-discriminatory employment, but

20

nevertheless, the practice is to review and evaluate

21

associates as they progress and to select from among those

22

associates those who will be allowed to advance in the

23

partnership and the remainder to be terminated by the

24

firm, we believe that is a term, condition, and privilege

25

of employment.

QUESTION:

1

Supposing -- Do they still have that

2

15-employee limit in Title VII where people employing less

3

than 15 aren't covered by it?

4

MR. BONDURANT:

The 15 or fewer emloyee limit

5

excludes business establishments with fewer than that

8

number of employees .
QUESTION:

7

Supposing a firm with 15 or fewer

8

employees made a representation that we are an equal

9

opportunity employer and we follow all the guidelines of

10

t he EEOC, would that be actionable under Title VII even

11

though they had less than 15 employees?
MR. BONDURANT:

12

No, Your Honor, it would be

13

actionable, if at all, under state law, because Title VII

14

explicitly excludes coverage from employe r s with fewer

15

than 15 employees.
QUESTION:

18

Mr. Bondurant, let's assume that

17

the Petitioner had been admitted to partnership in

18

Spalding and two or three years after young partners of

111

the same rough age and experience were up for promotion

20

within the firm, be entitled to a greater percentage of

21

participation, would your position be the same?

23

Your Honor, let me answer it in

MR. BONDURANT:

22

two ways.

King &

First, that is not our case.

24

QUESTION:

I know that.

25

MR. BONDURANT:

This question is a denial of the

1

admission to partnership itself and whether it is

2

actionable under Title VI I.

3

Secondly, under the broader theory which we

4

advocate, it is our view that that would be covered by

6

Title VII.

8

The question under Title VII is whether or not

7

the relationship between a lawyer practicing with a firm

8

and the firm itself is an entity, is an employment

9

relationship; that is does it have the principal

10

attributes of employment as a matter of economic reality,

11

it is not a formalistic relationship, and, therefore, if,

12

for the sake of a hypothetical, after three years as a

13

member of the partnership the firm should simply vote to

14

reduce a female or black partner's earnings to zero as a

15

method of excluding them from the partnership, having

18

being compelled to admit them in the first instance under

17

an order of the court.

independently actionable under Title VII .

It is our view that that would be

QUESTION:

Don't go quite so fast.

What is the

answer to my question?
MR. BONDURANT:

3

Pardon me.

If the partner were

4

in the protective group of persons covered by Title VII,

5

if the partner believed that there was a causal connection

8

between the decision made by the institution itself

7

affecting compensation, terms, or other conditions of

8

employment, it would be actionable under Title VII in our

9

view.
QUESTION:

10

11

You are saying that a partner is an

employee of the firm always?
MR. BONDURANT:

12

We are saying that for purposes

13

of Title VII the relationship between a partner and a law

14

firm has sufficient attributes of -QUESTION:

15

Can't you just answer that question?

18

We are dealing with the issue of whether or not Title VII

17

applies.

18

Now, is it your position that a partner, once a partner,

19

always is a employee for purposes of Title VII?

20

21
22
23

It only applies if an individual is an employee .

MR . BONDURANT:

For purposes of Title VII, the

answer is yes.
QUESTION:

Yes .

The only consequences, Justice

19

Is that relevant?

unique position within the community, but it is that

position, we suggest, wh i ch advocates for and not against

minorities progress within the legal profession than in

2

any other capacity, because lawyers are in a unique

3

position to influence the course of events in ways that

4

businessmen, bankers, corporate vice presidents, and other

5

people, all of whom are covered by Title VII, do not have

e

the same capacity.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Bondurant, would you concede that

8

judgments are made with respect to a variety of

9

qualifications when the partnership decision is made?

10

MR. BONDURANT:

11

QUESTION:

12

Absolutely .

And, many of those judgments are

subjective .
MR. BONDURANT:

13

I would also concede they are

14

subjective just as they are in the question of whom an

15

o r dinary business enterprise would employ for a particular

18

position, particularly one of higher than a menial

17

capacity.

18

QUESTION:

So, it is possible a firm may need

19

somebody to do damage suit litigation and if an individual

20

in competition with that associate was very good at

21

corporate law, would those factors be considered?

22

MR. BONDURANT:

As long as none of the

23

prohibitive factors covered by Title VII were factors in

24

the decision, the firm is free to provide and apply

25

subjective criteria in determining who to admit to

MR. BATOR :

MR. Bator?

Mr . Chief Justice, and may i t pl ease

the Court:
The government's submission in this case i s

8

quite straight for ward and we ask the Cou r t in this case

9

not to decide the difficult questions as to whethe r and

10

wha t extent partners may ever themselves be regarded as

11

employees of a partnership .

12

On that question the

13

We feel that whatever view one takes on th at

14

question, Ms . Hishon' s complaint in t h is case stat e d a

15

good cause of action under Title VII, because Title VI I

18

clearly and sharply provides that women employees may not

17

be treated worse than male employees, the statutor y

language that there may not be disc r imination with respect

Of all of the professions in the United States

Yes.
They drafted this bill.

How can you

say they didn't mean to cover lawyers?

4

MR. MORGAN:

15

QUESTION:

e

MR. MORGAN:

Well, sir -That is your position, isn't it?
That is my position .

It was so

1

obvious and so apparent that three decisions of this Court

8

surely would apply.
One of them is, of course, Catholic Bishop .

9

10

Secondly -- A second decision that would apply would be

11

Yeshiva, because they identify, and the third decision

12

would Bell Aerospace.

13

You know, Congress can sit over there and they

14

can't think of every crazy thing somebody is going to

15

bring up and if they did, then they would write an

18

exception in for that. But, in this particular instance,

17

Congressman McCulloch, Chairman, himself a partner in a

18

law firm, Congressman Seller who had been with a law firm

19

previously and may have been at the time, but he was

20

previously, and partners in law firms sitting there, some

21

of them, could never even conceive that anyone was going

22

to come and say, well, we are going to make partne r s under

Title VII.

MR. MORGAN :

Oh, no.

I think -- In the fi r st

place , assuming that all business part nerships have a

20

right of commercial association, then they would be

21

covered and they would have a lower standard of con-

22

stitutional rights with respect to what is done to them by

23

the government through the EEOC, which would assume

QUESTION:

What cases from this Court suppor t

4

you in suggesting that lawyers have th is very high claim

5

to resist government regulations because they are

advocates.
MR. MORGAN:

7

No, no, that is not -- What we say

8

is that law firms a r e advocacy organizations which handle

9

In t he

10

Button case, we talked particularly, the Court did, about

11

use of litigation to political ends .

12

13

redress of grievance in court or out of court, and doin g

14

18

of law firms .

Law firms certainly

That is what we say abo ut the advocacy rights

17

As far as whether or not that gives them a

18

higher standard of p r otection, surely i t does when a

19

q uestion is asked in an interrogatory such as here by the

w

Plaintiff, which could be asked in the EEOC, just in the

21

case preceding.

22

QUESTION:

Well, supposing that Congress is not

23

t r ying to deter advocacy expressly, it is saying that law

24

firms are going to be subject to mi n imum wage laws, maybe

25

they have to bargain collectively with representatives of

2

Now, I wouldn't think that any of those things raised and

3

constitutional question whatever.
MR. MORGAN:

Your Honor, as I recall, on the

5

minimum wage, they would come off as a professional

a

exemption, but -QUESTION:

7

8

Let ' s assume Congress decided to

repeal a professional exemption .
MR. MORGAN:

All right.

As far as the purely

10

business and economic aspects of law firms, to wit, Fair

11

Labor Standards Act and the minimum wage laws, I think you

12

are right .

13

QUESTION:

But, we are not dealing with purely

14

business -- You appa r ently feel there is some higher,

15

loftier goal of law firm than making money.

18

let's put in that higher, loftier goal.

17

Congress do just what it wants to with respect to law

18

firms with minimum wages, civil rights, collective

19

bargaining?

20

MR. MORGAN:

And, even,

Why can't

Because what it does is it takes in

21

this particular instance and places an advocacy agency of

22

the federal government overseeing the law firms.

23

The case you just heard before this case

24

involving EE0-1 reports, in that particular case -- Law

Now, the EEOC decides to go against a law firm.

4

It has a subpoena power. and it can subpoena the law fi rm' s

5

8

responses, as are contained in the record and the District

7

Court, say she didn't get along with our clients in effect

8

amongst other things and those are the reasons we didn't

admit her.

10

In this particular case, King & Spalding's
