matter, if you wanted tc borrow money from the b ank cn

the same type of security that that unimproved p roperty

4

would have afforded you for whatever lean a bank might

couldn't you borrow money on the strength of the

7

potential award?
MR. ROADYi

8
9

I would submit not. Your H oner,

because what the secured interest owner would lo ok tc

10

would be the property, and the property is at th at time

11

in a state of limbo insofar as the award is cone erned.

12

Well, my experience has bee n that

13

banks aren’t crazy about unsecured property, whe ther it

14

is — unimproved property, whether they are subj ec t to

15

condemnation proceedings or not, but are you say ing the

16

banks in that part of the country would be less likely

17

to treat as security the potential award on the propert y

18

than the property itself.

It is security to the extent of

10

Mr. Eoady —
Yes, Your Honor.
-- the facts that you rely on here

11

to constitute a taking, a prepayment taking, wouldn’t

12

those same facts exist in any Section 257 straight

MR. ROADY;

14

17
18

To a great degree, Your Honor,

yes .
QUESTION;

Well, wouldn't it turn every 257

proceeding into a 258 proceeding, in effect?
MR. ROADY;

The only distinction, Your Hcncr,

19

is that in a 257 case involving land which has

20

income-producing capabilities and is producing income,

21

that situation does not fit as readily into this Court’s

22

those cases which say that there is no taking when there

is remaining, such as in Agins against City of Tiburcn,

You would make the same arguments

even if you had this vast timber land that was not

down the trees any time you wanted to.
MR. ROADYj

9

QUESTION:

10
11

You would still say that as seen as

they filed the complaint, you are entitled to interest.
MR. RCADYs

12

13

Yes.

Correct.

Yes, sir.

I would

indeed say that.
QUESTION:

14

What was it about the filing cf the

15

complaint that prevented you from cutting down the trees

16

if it had net been fer your prior agreement?
MR. F.OADY;

17

Your Honor, our position relating

18

to the filing of the complaint is based upon the fact

19

that that was the moment when the federal government

20

asserted in a positive public way its intent tc take the

21

proper ty.

22

QUESTION:

But this was not a declaration cf

23

taking proceeding.

This was straight condemnation, and

24

that case that Justice Peed wrote a number cf years says

25

that one of the things the government is entitled tc

AL0ER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

look to in straight condemnation is whether it wants to

2

buy the property at the price the jury cr the

3

commissioners fix.
ME. BOADY;

4

That is true.

We do not question

S

the right of the government to back out of a

6

condemnation once it has been filed under Section 257.
QUESTION;

7

Well, maybe I am asking the same

8

question my brother Behnquist did, tut I don't

9

understand how the institution of the condemnation

10

proceedings deprived you of anything when you had agreed

11

before

the proceeding was begun not to use it.
MR. ROADY;

12

This, Your Honor, was the

13

impediment on the legal interests which had not existed

14

before.

15

of lis pendence.

16

was to place a barrier around the titles, around the

17

economic uses which might be made of this property.

18

was at that moment, locking at the line of cases that

19

have said there may be a series of events which, once

20

there is a certainty that the government is going to

21

move forward in this respect, reaches a taking level.

22

At the same time, the government filed a notice
The effect of those two circumstances

QUESTION;

It

Well, I don't know what the effect

23

of a lis pendence is in Texas, but I know that when I

24

practiced in Arizona, it simply was to say, advise

25

everyone that the property was subject to a condemnation

15

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

action.

Now, that does not impair the use of the

2

property, the filing of a lis pendence, any more than

3

the filing of a condemnation action.

4

give the putlic notice of the filing of the condemnation

5

action.

So what has the lis pendence get to do with it?
MR. ROADYi

6

All that does it

Your Honor, the lis pendence is

7

the confirmation in the public record in addition to the

8

condemnation petition itself that the government is
going forward with its intent tc take.
QUESTION4

10
11

But it is going forward and

proceeding by straight condemnation.

12

MR. ROADYi

13

QUESTIONS

Correct.
But I am still not satisfied with

14

what you have said, that there were any other

15

impediments on the use of the land.

16

that if you haven't entered into this other agreement,

17

you would have been free to cut the timber on the land.

18

Certainly you are free to place a security interest on

1

the land, if you could have gotten somebody to give you

20

a security interest on the land.

21

are impaired in the use of the land except the way

22

anybody is impaired in that you can't really sell land

23

after a condemnation action has been filed because

24

people are just waiting to see what the commissioners

25

find.

I think you agree

KR. ROADY:

1

Cur position, Your Honor, is that

2

the practical impediments to the economic use of the

3

property were such that after the filing of the

4

complaint and after the posting of the lis pendence

6

notice rendered all economic use unavailable, and this

within

demonstrates that the burdens which the property has not

How, one of the vital questions in this case,

10

before authoritatively is the question of what is a

We submit to the Court that it is the

17
18

deprivation of the interest of the landowner.

In this

19

case, and this is the reason I emphasized the purpose of

20

the condemnation here, is it the effective

21

accomplishment of the purposes of the condemnation which

is the taking?

If the taking occurred at the time of the payment of the

award,

the test of the taking.

As the Court is aware, there is a conflict on

this question between the Fifth and the Ninth Circuits,

QUESTION;

11

MS. SHAPIRO;

Well, in some cases --

damage, but the point is that in other cases, the

landowner may vastly prefer to remain in possession

Marshall asked you if there weren’t a cloud on the title

as a result of the condemnation proceeding, and you said

6

yes, there was.

8

What do you understand in that sense a

MS. SHAPIROs

What I understand it to mean is

9

that there is going to be -- people are going to act as

10

though the landowner can’t -- I mean, they will be less

11

willing to buy and sell, or they will be less willing to

12

deal with it.

MS. SHAPIRO*

Yes.

You don’t understand the cloud on

the title in that sense to suggest any question abcut

18

the owner's ability to pay fee title?

19

MS. SHAPIROs

Oh, no, no, no, absolutely net.

20

The other point is that since under our theory and under

21

the established principles the title to the land and the

22

value -- the valuation date is the date that the taking

23

occurs, we agree that if in fact between the date of

24

valuation here in 1979 and the date that the land was

25

actually taken there has been an increase in the value

41

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

then the landowner is entitled to show that

1

of the land

2

increase, either by a motion under Rule 60(b) asking for

3

relief from the judgment, or he can also go in under

4

Rule 71(a) and ask that it is no longer equitable

5

because of the delays to permit the judgment to be

8

excecu ted.
But the point is, if you have -- and you can

7

8

— if the land has increased in value, he can show that,

0

because he is entitled to just compensation at the date

10

of taking, but to say that, well, interest is kind of a

11

rough equivalent of that is just wrong, because what you

12

have to look at in deciding whether he has gotten just

13

compensation is whether land prices have increased, not

14

what has happened to the value of money.

have got nothing to do with his just compensation claim,

this Court's decisions involving the police power on

10

As we explain in our brief, in

before it has found a constitutional taking.
It is worth emphasizing that even if the

11
12

question were closer than we think it is,

there are

13

serious practical problems in carrying out the case by

14

case analysis used in land use cases in the context of

15

condemnation proceedings, sc that the date of taking

16

must be litigated in each case.
That brings in idiosyncratic values and

17
18

potential complications in determining the date of

19

valuation that would seriously complicate an already

20

complex process.

21

significant difference between the two kinds of cases

22

that justifies treating them differently.

There is a constitutionally

powers, it recognizes the landowner's right to

25

just compensation.

The dispute is simply ever hew that

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 620-000

1

just compensation should be calculated, not over whether

2

the property owner is entitled to any payment at all.

3

The government should be allowed more leeway when it is

4

establishing parks and preserving scenic values by

5

condemning land and paying for it than when it tries to

6

achieve the same results by zoning and imposing the

7

burdens on the landowner without paying him anything.

8
9

Mayen and Dow recognize that, and the dissent
in Penn Central certainly sounds as though the

10

dissenters would have agreed with the majority that

11

there was no taking if the complaint there had involved

12

simply temporary interferences in the course of a

13

condemnation proceeding.

14

Long delays in paying condemnation awards of

15

course may hurt landowners, tut they are not the

16

helpless victims that petitioner portrays.

17

because the landowner is entitled to the fair market

18

value at the time his land is taken, he is entitled to

show that the land has increased in value since the

original valuation date.
