Mr. McMahon, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. KC MAHON, ESQUIRE,

7

ON EEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MC MAHON:

8

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice,

9 and may it please the Court.

The issue in this case is whether the

10
11

establishment clause prohibits a municipality from

12

including a creche in a traditional and dominantly

13 secular Christmas celebration.

The city of Pawtucket,

14

Rhode Island, has for over 40 years sponsored an annual

15

Christmas celebration.

It consists of parties,

16 Christmas carols, the lighting and decoration of public
17

buildings, and a display situated on the grounds of a

18 museum

in the center of the commercial area of the

19 city.

The display, which is laid out over 40,000 square

20 feet, consists of a wishing well, colored lights, a
21

40-foot high lighted spruce tree, figures of Santa

22

Claus,

23

and bells and lights and a large Season's Greetings, 48

24

feet long and lighted.

25

a live Santa Claus, and various figures of stars

Included in this display,

covering

approximately 140 square feet out of the total 40,000

2

square foot area, is a creche.

QUESTION;

years,

show that?

Has the creche been there for 40

used every year for 40 years?

MR. MC MAHON:

6

Does the record

Yes, Justice, but the display

7 has not teen in that location for those 40 years.
8

has been in this location since 1973.

years?

But a creche has been used for 40

The record shews that?

11

MR. MC MAHCN;

That is correct, Justice.

12

The creche consists of a small stable and

13 approximately 15 figures ranging in height from one foot
14

to five feet.
The District Court has permanently enjoined

15
10

the city from continuing its practice of including the

17 creche in its Christmas celebration.
18

It did so by

applying the three-part test set forth by this Court in

19 Lemon against Kurtzman, concluding that the city’s
20 sponsorship of the creche violated each portion of that
21

22

test.
The Court of Appeals, by divided vote,

23

affirmed, agreeing with the District Court as to the

24

first two parts of the Lemon test, but further

25 invalidating the city's sponsorship of the creche under

the strict scrutiny analysis applied by this Court in

2 Larson against Valente.
It is the position of the city before this

3
4

Court that the public recognition of the nativity scene

5

in the American Christmas is not a promotion of

6

religion, but really is an acknowledgement of the

7 religious heritage of the American Christmas.

In order

8 to determine whether government —
QUESTION:

9

I am just curious as to one fact.

10 Was a stay order issued in this case, or an injunction?

MR. MC MAHON;

11
12

issued, yes. Justice.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MC MAHON;

15

QUESTION:

16

A permanent injunction was

And it is still in effect?
That is correct, Justice.

So that in -- This concerned 19E0,

didn't it?

17

MR. MC MAHON:

18

QUESTION:

That is correct.

So that in 1981 and 1982 you had no

19 creche ?

MR. MC MAHON:

20

The city has not sponsored a

21

creche.

The city transferred the creche to a private

22

group under a conditional agreement dependent upon the

23

injunction in this case, and if the injunction in this

24 case were to be dissolved,
25

the creche.

then the city would reacquire

1

of the creche, but it is in the same area, but the city

2

is enjoined from the practice of continuing it, and I

3

might note that the record indicates that the particular

4

creche in question had a useful life which was close to

5

expiring and would probably have to be replaced in any

6

event.

7

QUESTION;

8

the last two years?

9

Has it been on public property in

ME. MC MAHON;

This has not been on public

10

property. Chief Justice, since 1973.

The property in

11

question is owned by the Slater Mill Museum Corporation,

12

which operates the — has restored the old Samuel Slater

13

cotton mill and operates it as a national museum.

14

It is submitted that in order to —

15

QUESTION;

Then the city sponsored creche from

16

1973 up until 1980 was basically not on city property,

17

but the exhibits were put together by the city?

18

MR. MC MAHON;

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. MC MAHON;

21

And owned by the city, Justice.

And owned by the city.
Yes.

But in 1981 and 1982,

only the secular portions of the display have been owned

22 and maintained by the city.

The city has had nothing

23

whatever to do with the creche since this injunction was

24

issued, and in fact the creche, while still in the same

25

general area, has been moved.

6

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

It is submitted by the city that the

1

2

distinction between the promotion of religion and the

3

recognition of religion must be determined by examining

4

the context in which the religious element is

5

presented.

We respectfully submit that in this context

6 the city is celebrating a legitimate national holiday
7 and not promoting religious dogma.
8

Furthermore, we will contend that the Lemon
test was inappropriately applied by the courts below

10 because it was applied only to the creche, as though it
11

existed in a vacuum, and it will be our submission that

12

the appropriate focus for the Lemon test should be tc

13 the entire government activity and not really to the
14
15

religious element contained within it.
This Court has frequently recognized that the

16 traditions of the American people are saturated with
17

religious influences.

As recently as the end of the

18 last term, in *arch against Chambers, this Court
1

sustained legislative prayer and legislative

20

chaplaincies, noting that they have been imbedded in our

21

traditions since the adoption of the First Amendment.

22

With respect to holidays, the Thanksgiving

23

tradition also goes back to the First Congress, which

24

requested President Washington to declare a day of

25 national prayer and

thanksgiving.

In McGowan against

7

ALDER30N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Maryland, this Court held that the recognition of Sunday

2

as a day of rest was a legitimate public activity

3 notwithstanding the fact that in so doing, it was aiding
4

religions who attract worshippers on that day and whc in

5

fact receive some substantial portion of their financial

6 support on that day.
QUESTIONS

7

Kr. McMahon, is there anything we

8 can refer to to let us know how long it has been the
9

practice in this country for public bodies to have

10 nativity scenes displayed?
11

Is there anything you can

cite to us in that regard?
MR. MC KAHCNs

12

Specifically, I cannot,

13

Justice.

The recognition of Christmas began in the

14

middle part of the last century.

15

first recognition of the legal holiday.

10 it was 1852.

1936 — 1836 was the
In Rhode Island

It became a federally recognized holiday

17

in 1870 , and it was during that period that nearly all

18

the states adopted Christmas a legal holiday, but

19

specifically with respect to the use of the nativity

20 scene, we have been unable to locate that data.
21

The creche is a symbol of Christmas which has

22

been used by the American people together with stars and

23

bells and Santa Claus and reindeer.

24

QUESTION*

It has its origin —

Haven't you noticed a lot of

25 Christmas celebrations without creches?

HE. KC MAHON:

2

QUESTION;

3

You keep saying they all go along

together.
MR. MC MAHON;

4
5

That is correct. Justice.

Well, of course, any symbol of

Christmas may be used alone.
QUESTION;

6

But this case is not aimed at all

7 of the decorations, right?

8

MR. MC MAHON;

9

QUESTION;

This case is aimed at one item.

10

HR. MC MAHON:

11

QUESTION:

12

That is correct. Justice.

That is correct.

Well, why don't we talk about that

one item without all of the others?
MR. MC MAHON:

13

Because that one item cannot be

14

properly evaluated in terms of what it is doing without

15

relating it to the overall celebration of which it is a

16 part.

QUESTION;

17
18

The creche —
Mr. McMahon, do you think that for

— a city could display a nativity scene alone without

19 other displays such as Santa Claus and Christmas trees
20 and so forth?

MR. KC MAHCN:

21
22

would

be —

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. MC MAHON:

25

Well, obviously, Justice, that

In your view?
That would obviously be less

secular than the record shown in this case.

However,

9

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
MO FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the most important part of the context, we would submit,

2

is Christmas itself, and any symbol of Christmas,

3

including the creche, is a symbol of what is a national

4 secular holiday.
5
6

A lone figure with Santa Claus does not
represent one isolated item of Christmas.

It represents

7 the entire Christmas holiday for what it is.
8

We

respectfully submit that the District Court was in error

9 in stating that the portions of the holiday celebration
10 could be dissected.
11

They become

merged over the years, through the uses of the people.
QUESTION;

12
13

They are intergrated.

Mr. McMahon, what is your answer to

Justice C'Connor's question, supposing there was nothing

14 but a creche?
HE. MC MAHON;

15

My answer is, it would still be

18 permissible. Justice, as a symbol of Christmas.
QUESTION;

17

So then we can ignore the remainder

18 of the exhibit.
ME. MC MAHON;

19

No, Justice.

I think that in

20 this case it is so clearly secular that the question as
21

to — the lone question is not presented on this

22 record.

However, were it presented, we would submit

23 that it remains a legitimate symbol of Christmas.
24

In

this case, however, it is sc overwhelmed by secular

25 symbolism that the question presented by Justice

10

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

O’Connor is not before the Court.

2

The Christmas holiday, although it clearly has

3 its origin in Christmas observance, is a secular folk

4 festival.

The nativity scene is interwoven into the

5 American celebration, but the American celebration is a
6 combination of feasting and fraternizing and music and
7 art and various types of socializing, and the religious
8 portion of Christmas is simply one component of it, and
9 it is a component that recognizes its religious
10 heritage.
11

QUESTION*

Mr. McMahon, could the city display

12 a cross for the celebration of Easter under your view? .
13

ME. MC MAHON*

Justice, I think that, first of

14 all, Easter is not a recognized public holiday, and the
15 association of a cross with a specifically religious
16 holiday might well implicate the promotion of religion.
17 I would point out, however,

that even that is probably

18 less religious than the Thanksgiving Day established by
19 President Washington’s proclamation in 1789, but I would
20 say that absent that historical base, the cross
21
22

specifically at Easter might well be a promotion.
However, I would point out that again it is a

23 matter of context, because in the American cemetery in
24 Normandy, for example, there are — it is filled with
25 crosses and stars of David and other symbols.

The same

2

ceremonies the cross and the star of David and other

3

religious symbols are employed.

4

In many Memorial Day

So, we would submit that in the context which

5

your question poses, Justice, it might well be a

6

promotion, but nevertheless the cross and the star of

7 David have legitimate secular uses depending on the
8

context.

We, of course, concede that there are contexts

9 in which the creche itself used as a — in a religious
10

exercise, obviously in a church, the creche could be a

11

-- its religious meaning could be isolated and

12

accentuated.

13

It is the context which determines --

The government is celebrating Christmas.

9 plays in that entire celebration.

10

12

QUESTION:

Do you concede the applicability of

the Lemon test here?
MR. MC MAHON:

Well, we don't think it's

13 necessary, Justice, but we feel that we have
14 demonstrated in our brief that the creche in this case
15

satisfies the Lemon test because of its secular content,

16 but no, we feel that the principles themselves are
17 sufficient to validate this practice.

Under McGowan,

18 under Marsh, we feel that — and the principles in the
19 other cases enunciated by this Court we feel are more
20
21
22

than sufficient to sustain the activity in this case.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

11

Very well.

MR. LEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, I would like to emphasize just briefly two

12 characteristics of Fawtucket's creche that in our view

13 make it a constitutionally permissible governmental
14 acknowledgement of an important part of the American
15 culture and heritage.
16

The first of these characteristics is that

It is not an

Everyone in this case accepts the

19 premise that the celebration of Christmas as a national
20 holiday is not an establishment of religion.

It follows

21

in our view that a non-coercive acknowledgement of this

22

undisputed fact — that one of the constituent elements

23 of this recognized holiday is religious -- is similarly
24 constitutional.
25

If it is permissible for Congress to make

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62M300

1

Christmas a national holiday, then it is permissible for

2 Pawtucket to announce the onset of the holiday, and
3 similarly to announce that one of the constituent
4 elements of that holiday is religious.
Christmas in this country in 1983 means many

5
3

things.

For the non-religious as well as for the

7 religious, it is the most joyous of our holidays.
8 Regardless of one’s religious beliefs, Christmas is a
g time of homecoming.

It is a time for family and

10 friends, for gifts and parties.
11

It is also a time cf

good will, and of concern for the needs of our fellow

12 human beings.
13

It is an eclectic holiday, and it has its

14 symbols.

One of those symbols is the creche, which is a

15 reminder that of all the sources from which the American
18 Christmas has grown over the years, one of them is
17 religious.

Neither in the Christmas context nor any

18 other does the First Amendment require that we exclude
ig enriching and important aspects of our history and our
20 traditions as illegitimate and therefore as
21
22
23

non-existent.
It was not by governmental decree that
Christmas acquired its religious aspect.

That came

24 about as a matter of undeniable historical fact, and to
25

deny its existence, to exclude it from our national

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

consciousness is nothing less, I submit, than

2 intellectual and historical dishonesty.

It is cultural

3 censorship, if you will, which is a First Amendment
4 concern, but not because the First Amendment requires it.
5
6

Every single argument raised by the lower
courts and by respondents against the creche are equally

7 applicable to Christmas itself.
8

If Christmas can

survive the First Amendment, as every party to this case

9 concedes that it can, then so can an acknowledgement of

10 the fact, the undisputed fact, that religion is one of
11

its ancestors.

The in-between position, which would

12 keep Christmas as a national holiday but force a
13 pretention that it is something other than what it is
14 will not withstand analysis.
15

QUESTION;

What test in your view should the

18 Court apply, Nr. Lee, in testing these things?
17

NR- LEE;

We submit. Justice O'Connor, that

18 the test that ought to be applied is one that is
19 narrowly tailored to the particular First Amendment
20 concerns of religious symbols.

MR. LEE*

1

I do.

I think, if you are going to

2 keep that test it would he better to do it that way, and
3 indeed,

I am somewhat sympathetic with the three-part

4

test, because in attempting to articulate one of my own ,

5

very often you do come back to these two concerns of

6 purpose and effect.
7

nevertheless, I simply submit that if you will

8 take a sample of the efforts of other courts, state and
9 federal, that have grappled with this issue of religious
10 symbols and the First Amendment in the context of such
11

things as the national motto and the pledge of

12 allegiance and the creche and a number of other things,
13 the madonna on the seal, you come away, I submit, with
14 the unmistakeable conclusion that we have really lost
15 sight of what the ultimate First Amendment inquiry is
16 and that these three tests themselves have become the
17

ultimate inquiry, and the reason is that they impart a

18 kind of an artificial objectivity, and to use Justice
19 Powell's language, analytical tidiness that in fact is
20 non-existent, and they give the impression of having
21

really accomplished the purpose without our ever

22 examining what the true First Amendment values are.
23

And for that reason, we submit that a test, if

24 you want to put it in terms of purpose and effect, fine,
25 but that it ought tc concentrate on such things as a

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

recognition first that it is a symbol, and starting from

2

that premise, ask yourselves what it is a symbol of, and

3

is it legitimately adjunct to something else, rather

4 than being, is it promotional or is it merely
5 commemorative.

And the final question that I would ask is, is

6

7 it coercive?

Now, with respect to the creche, I submit

8

that of all of the possible symbols that government

9

might have selected or that might be used by government,

10

the least potential for coerciveness, or that there is

11

none that has less potential for coercion than does the

12 symbol.
13

I like the use of, say, an anthem, or an oath

of office, or a pledge of allegiance whose

14 religion-acknowleding words, the individual must either
15 affirmatively state or be noticed for declining to do
16

so.

The presence of an outdoor creche leaves the

17 individual completely free to react to it however he or
18

she pleases without anyone else knowing what that

19

reaction is.

20

21

Now, it is true that the primary issues
presented by the creche are — we pidgeonhole them, we

22 categorize them as establishment clause issues.

But

23

this Court’s decisions make it very clear that in

24

deciding establishment issues, free exercised values are

25

nevertheless very relevant and should not be ignored.

QUESTION*

5

MB. LEE;

6

QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor General —
Excuse me.
May I ask you one question?
Yes.
The two elements of your test, as I

7 understand it, are the absence of coercion, the fact
8 that it is a recognized symbol, and it is part of a

9 larger package.
10

MB. LEE*

11

QUESTION;

That is correct.
Nell, for many people, going to

12

church or saying prayers and attending religious

13

ceremonies are also part of the Christmas tradition.

14

Would you apply your test to say an overt prayer is a

15

very small part of the total display, or saying mass in

16

the square, something like that?
MB. LEE*

17

Where it is governmentally

18 sponsored?

QUESTION;

19

Governmentally sponsored, but part

20

of a much larger display, and only totally voluntary and

21

non-coercive, and just as part of the symbols that many

22

of us respect very deeply.
MR. LEE;

23
24 harder
25

That is a hypothetical that is much

than this one.

It is one that tests the outer

limits of my theory, but I would answer it yes.

QUESTIONS

2

NR. LEE;

3

QUESTION:

4

That would be permissible?
In my view, yes.
When Congress authorizes the

payment of something like $30,000 a year, I think, for

5 the chaplain in the House and the chaplain in the
6

Senate, is that symbolic or is it substantive?

7

MR. LEE:

8

than is this case.

Well, it is certainly less symbolic
Now, in that case, Karsh versus

9 Chambers, which we of course supported with an amicus
10

brief,

there was an additional concern, which was mainly

11

historical, and the Court reached the right result in

12

that case relying on historical considerations, and

13

might point out in that respect that in Karsh versus

I

14 Chambers, the Court very properly did not apply the
15 thrree-vay test. It could have done so, and I submit that
16

the reason that that approach was sound was simply that

17 the three-part test is just not all that helpful in
18 deciding the constitutionality of chaplains* prayers,
19
20

21

and the same is true here.
QUESTION;

Well, I suppose there, though,

there was rather clear evidence of the intent of the

22 framers of the First Amendment.
23

MR. LEE:

24

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Do we have that kind of evidence

25 here with respect to display of a nativity scene?

22

AUJERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC

1

ME. LEEs

Not with that degree of specificity,

2 Justice O’Connor.
3

Let me just submit finally that to the extent

4

the First Amendment is involved in this case at all, it

5

favers Pawtucket’s right to continue to do what it has

6

done for almost half a century. No one in this case is

7 contending that Christmas itself must be disestablished
8

as a national holiday, and neither is anyone denying

9 that one of the elements of this holiday is religious.

10

The First Amendment not only does not require,

11

it would, I submit, be positively offended by a ruling

12

that would say to the city of Pawtucket, yes, you may

13

announce Christmas in every respect except for one.

The

14 one thing you may not announce is that Christmas has
15

anything to do with the birth of Christ.

That would

16 make the acceptability of the announcement turn on its
17 content, more specifically on its lack of religious
18 content, in clear violation of First Amendment
19 principies.
20

For these reasons, we submit that the judgment

21

of the lower court should be reversed.

22

has further questions, I have nothing.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. DE LUCA:

1
2

please the Court, with the possible exception of the

3 cross,
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the nativity scene is one of the most powerful

religious symbols in this country, and most certainly

5 one of

the most powerful Christian religious symbols in

6 this country.

It is, as all of the parties agree and

7

acknowledge, the biblical account of the birth of

8

Christ, the Christian Messiah, the Redeemer, according

9

to the gospels of Matthew and Luke as contained in the

10

New Testament.
Pawtucket's purchase, the maintenance,

11
12

and the

erection of the fundamental Christian symbol involves

13 government in religion to a profound and substantial
14

degree.

It has aligned itself with a universally

15

recognized religious symbol and belief.

16

bring to the Court's attention that although the

17

religious symbol, the creche, is contained in a display

I would like to

18 that is on private property — it is owned by the Slater
19

Museum Historical Society -- it is adjacent to the City

20

Hall.

21

this area.

22

City Hall is approximately 100 feet away from

Also, the creche and the display itself is —

23 there is a ceremony that is held by the mayor of

the

24

city of Pawtucket each year, a lighting ceremony, which

25

announces the commencement of the display in the Hodgson

Park area

2

the same music that is also played inside of City Hall,

3

and all of the festivities that take place at the

4

display and at City Hall are paid for and sponsored by

5

the city of Pawtucket.

6
7

QUESTION*

Well, Hr. Deluca, you say that

although the property, the real property, I take it, on

8 which the creche is located is private, it is only --it
9

adjacent to city property.

Now, if the city did not own

10 the creche itself, so that everything that was
11

contributed to the display, including the creche, were

12 privately owned, it wouldn't violate the First
13

Amendment, the fact that it was right next door to the

14

City Hall, would it?

15

KB. DE LUCA*

Well, I think that in the — I

16

think that in understanding that the city owns all of

17

the symbols and all of the artifacts that are contained

18 in this display, and assuming that that — the creche
19

were purchased and paid for privately without any other

20 explanation that it is private, then I think it would
21

still violate the establishment clause for the First

22

Amendment, because there is no indication to anyone

23 looking at that that the display or the creche is not
24

part of the broader display which is put up and

25 sponsored by the city.

QOESTIONj

Would you regard the prayer that I

2

spoke of to your friend in the House or the Senate or in

3

any state legislature as purely symbolic, or is it a

4

matter of substance?

5

MR. DE LUCAi

I think that prayer is purely

6 symbolic, and I think this Court made that observation
7 in Marsh versus Chambers, in conjunction with relying on

8 the unique history that this Court found to be
9

applicable to the prayer in Nebraska and generally in

10 legislatures and in Congress.
11

QUESTIONS

Now, is it purely symbolic in your

12

view when the chaplain gets up and asks for divine

13

guidance on the members of the legislative body?

14

that your view, that it is purely symbolic?

15

MR. DE LUCAi

Is

Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

I believe that when the chaplain begins his invocation,

17

I think it serves two purposes.

18

attention of the individuals who are presumably

19

beginning the session, and two, it is simply a

20

formalized way of commencing the session, asking people

21

to meditate, to begin to experience and indeed

One, it gets the

22 appreciate the seriousness with which

they must approach

23

the business that is going to be before them today as

24

Congressmen and Congresswomen, and I think that is the

25

primary purpose of that kind of invocation in that

QUESTION*

2
3

It has nothing to do with any

religious faith, in your view?
MB. DE LUCA*

4

Well, it most certainly is an

5

acknowledgement of a religious faith.

6

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

I have to admit

However, there is a big

7 difference between an acknowledgement of religion

8 without actually sponsoring a religious point of view as
9 opposed to in this particular case, where we are not

0 only acknowledging religion, but we are acknowledging a
particular form of religion, notably Christianity.
I do not think anyone can argue that the

12

3 nativity scene does not depict the historical birth of
4 Christ.

We all acknowledge that Christ was born

5 approximately 2,000 years ago.
6

What the nativity scene

does, it acknowledges the divinity of Christ.

It

7 acknowledges that the Christian Messiah has come, and
8

that in conjunction with Easter, I think, in biblical

9

terms anway, is indicative of and personifies precisely

20

what Christians believe, to the exclusion of course, of

2

all the non-believers and those individuals who do net

22

have Christian philosophy or religion.

23
24

Approximately one week after this suit was
filed, there was a press conference held at — in the

25 display, in front of the nativity scene.

A podium was

27
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

erected specifically for the purpose of holding this

2

press conference.

The press conference was called by

3 the mayor of the city of Pawtucket, Mr. Lynch.4

At that

press conference, Mr. Lynch made it clear, and present,

5 of course, were the media.

There were a group of school

6 children that came down from a nearby public school
7 along with their teacher, and a variety of other
8 individuals who had stopped to listen to the mayor give
9

his — or begin his press conference.

This was at 1:30

10 in the afternoon.

At that press conference,

11

he avowed publicly

12 and was reportedly widely in the media, in the newspaper
13

and on television, that he was going to fight the

14

American Civil Liberties Union in order to keep Christ

15 in Christmas.
16

The purpose of the mayor's statement and

its effect was clearly religious and clearly Christian,

17 and the message was heard and was echoed by the many
18

letters which are part of the record in this case, by

19

the many letters both from people in Pawtucket, outside

20 of Pawtucket, and from —

QUESTION*

21

Well, that was basically the

22 mayor's reaction to something that your clients had
23 done,

I take it.

Is there any reason to think the mayor

24 would have done that had not he been challenged
25

— had

not the city been challenged in its creche display?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

ME. DE LUCAi

1

Well, he may not have done that

2 if it hadn’t been challenged, if the suit had not been
3 filed,

but I think it is indicative of the purpose and

4 effect of the erection of that display, of the creche.
5 The fact that he believes that the creche should be

6 continued as part of the display because what we are
7 trying to do and what we will be doing is to fight the

8 American Civil liberties Union and all of the
9 non-believers and athiests to keep Christ in Christmas,
10 that goes — I’m sorry.

11

QUESTIONS

Well, do you say that when the

12 mayor said he was going to

"fight the American Civil

13 Liberties Union," he was — you suggest he was declaring
14 war on non-believers and athiests.
15

I don't think of the

American Civil Liberties Union as necessarily standing

16 for non-believers and athiests.
17

MR. DE LUCAs

I am not suggesting that.

What

18 I am suggesting is that when the mayor took the — when
19

the mayor as the mayor of the city of Pawtucket, as the

20 elected official of all of the people of the city of
21

Pawtucket, believers and non-believers, Christians and

22 non-Christians, stood before the nativity scene in an
23 orchestrated press conference to announce that he was
24 going to fight to keep Christ in Christmas, I think

that

25 the effect -- it can be fairly inferred that the effect

29

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

of that press conference was to suggest that what we are

2

trying to do, that is, what the people who brought this

3 suit are trying to do is take a religious symbol away
4 from the majority of the people who happen to believe
5

that Christmas is for Christ, and anyone who is against

8 that is against what the majority of the citizens of
7 Pawtucket believe.
8

I don’t believe that he was engaging -- or

9 announcing that he was engaging in warfare, but I do

10 believe that he announced -11

QUESTION*

Don’t you think an opinion can be

12 written upholding you side without mentioning the

13 mayor?

MR. DE LUCAs

14

Do I think — Yes, I do, Mr.

15 Justice Marshall.

QUESTIONS

16

Well, why are you staying on it so

17 long?

MR. DE LUCAs

18

I brought the mayor's press

19 conference to your attention because I thought it was —
20 had some probative value, but I would also like to

21

suggest that in spite of the mayor's publicly avowed

22 purpose of the creche in the Christmas display -23

QUESTIONS

Well, excuse me for even mentioning

24 it.
25

SR. DE LUCA;

The city at the trial offered

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

three other reasons for the inclusion of the nativity

2 scene in the annual Christmas display.
3 economic.

The first was

The second was cultural and traditional» and

4 the third was aesthetic.

The District Court, since

5 there was no evidence offered as to the aesthetic value

6 of the creche, made a finding that there was obviously
7 no evidence to support that position.
8

He went on to address the issues — the

9 reasons of economic, cultural, and traditional.

The

10 District Court found in applying the secular purpose

11 test that the city’s own witnesses — they had two
12 witnesses, two merchants testify, and they admitted that
13 the deletion of the creche from the display itself would

14 have no economic impact on the downtown area, the
15 commercial -- the commercial area of Pawtucket.
One of the reasons, obviously, that the city

18

17 gave for including the creche was because it attracted
18 shoppers.

These individuals readily admitted that that

19 was not the case.
20
21

Also, as it related to the cultural and
traditional reasons advanced by the city, the District

22 Court found that the primary purpose and effect of the
23 nativity scene was tc advance religion.

Relying on the

24 testimony and exhibits, the court found no evidentiary
25 support for the cultural and traditional reasons

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1
2

advanced by the city.
Indeed, the court found that the evidence

3 supported a contrary conclusion.

More particularly, the

4 court made a finding that as far as cultural and
5 traditional were concerned, the city made no attempt to
6

disclaim the religious meaning of the creche, and in

7 addition to that there was no evidence to support the
8

allegation that it had been a tradition in Pawtucket to

9 have this type of display or similar religious displays

10 erected over the last 40, 50, or 60 years, or within the
11
12

history of the city of Pawtucket.
QUESTION*

You mean, you disagree that it had

13 been displayed for 40 years?
14
15

MR. DE LUCA*

been displayed, Justice O'Connor, since 1973 in its

16 present locale.
17

I don't disagree that it has

I agree with that.

What I am -- What I

am suggesting to you is that there was no evidence

18 the city made the allegation that they were merely
19 acknowledging a cultural and traditional aspect of the

20 citizens of Pawtucket.
21

This is the only holiday that

the city of — only religious holiday that the city of

22 Pawtucket has acknowledged culturally or traditionally,
23 and the District Court made that finding.
24

QUESTION*

Several years ago, Mr. DeLuca,

25 there was a ceremony held on the Mall, which is federal

32
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

property, of course.

My recollection is from news

2 accounts there were 200,000 or 300,000 people, in any
3 event a great many people, and
4 over by Pope John Paul II.

the ceremony was presided

Would you say that was a

5 step toward or an establishment of religion violative of

6 the religion clauses?
MB. DE LUCA:

7

I believe that was on the Elipse

8 across the street from the state — in any event, it was

on public property, and I believe — it was my
10 understanding, Mr. Chief Justice, that that property has
11

been used traditionally or historically as a place where

12 people can express their principles, beliefs, or
13 non-beliefs, so that in that context I think that it was
14 inappropriate to have a mass being said by the Pope,
15

because I think that in a sense, that that was an

16 establishment or sponsorship of religion, but at least
17

the argument there that could be made is that it was a

18 forum that
1

was provided to all people, regardless of

their beliefs, regardless of their principles, as

20 opposed to a specific sponsorship of a religious symbol,
21

as it is in this case.

22

QUESTION:

Then you think it would be all

23 right to put a creche over on the Mall?
24
25 to put

MR. DE LUCA:

No, I don’t think it’s all right

a creche over on the Mall.

I think what we have

33
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

to look at is

2

QUESTION;

3

MR. DE LUCA;

4

QUESTION;

5 from a

6

Well, what’s the difference?
The difference --

How do you distinguish a high mass

creche?
MR. DE LUCA;

Well, I think we have to look at

7 the — as the District Court did in this case, the

8 factual setting.

We have to go, as this Court must do

9 if it is going to apply the Lemon versus Kurtzman test,
10 is look at the factual setting, the circumstances

11

surrounding the erection of the creche, the

12 circumstances surrounding the Papal mass, or any other
13

religious symbol that would be displayed or enacted»

14 performed on public property.
15

We just can’t look at it

in a vacuum and say that it is okay or it is not okay.

16 We have to look at it more in terms of the circumstances
17 evolving from the use of the mass or the symbol.
18
19

QUESTION;

Well, there was a considerable

involvement of government in that ceremony, hundreds of

20 extra policemen on duty, streets closed for traffic
21

control purposes, and all that sort of thing.

That was

22 a considerable governmental involvement, was it not?
23
24

MR. DE LUCA;

Yes, it was, Mr. Chief Justice,

and I think that I would argue respectfully that it

25 could create or did create excessive government

34

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

entanglement insofar as the government's relationship

2 with a religious group, most notably the Roman Catholic
3

Church .

But I think, that the police — and I may be

4

incorrect in my assumptions, but I believe that the

5

costs for the Papal mass, the erection of the altar and

6 the podium and a variety of other costs that were
7 incident to the mass was paid for by the Roman Catholic
8 Diocese.
9

QUESTIONi

But not the thousands of dollars

10 involved in the extra management problems, the policing,

11
12

the traffic control?
MR. DE LUCA:

That's correct.

I think an

13 argument can be made there also as it relates to the
14

question of free exercise, accommodating the free

15 exercise of religion, and of course this Court has noted
16

on many occasions that there is sometimes a clash

17

between free exercise and the establishment clause, and

18 under the circumstances, it may be appropriate, under
19

certain circumstances it may be appropriate for the

20 establishment clause in certain situations to give way

21

to the free exercise of religion so that people can

22

practice their religion without interference from

23

government.

24

QUESTION:

Mr. Deluca, do you think that any

25 religious effect of the creche display in Pawtucket was

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

diminished by the fact that it included the display of a

2

Christinas tree and a clown and a robot and reindeer and

3

so forth?

4

BB. DE LUCAs

Well, I think -- I have two

5 answers to your question, Justice O'Connor.

First,

I

6

think that the District — and I — not think, I know

7

that the District Court made a finding of fact that the

8

setting that the creche appeared in was supportive of

9

its meaning.

10
11

There was testimony from a child — not a
child, a clinical psychologist by the name of Wurley who

12 said that a display of this type which contains Disney
13 characters, robots, Santa Claus, candy being given out

to children, a talking wishing well, is magical.

15 magical to children.
16

It is

It is designed, it is intended to

attract children, and once the children are there, then

17 of course as this witness testified it has a significant
18

impact on that child, and if you are a non-Christian

19

child looking at this display, and if you are a

20 non-Christian child looking at the nativity scene
21

contained in this display, realizing it is supported by

22

the city of Pawtucket, government-supported, then it

23 raises the question for the child and for that child 's
24

parents as to whether or not they are okay, because they

25 are not part of the culture that is being represented.

36

It raises the question for the child as to

1

2 whether or not they are normal because they are not part
3 of or do not believe in the religious symbol that is
4

being displayed in this display, and I don't think that

5 the secular symbols take away from the religious meaning
6 and the religious intent of the nativity scene, no more
7 than the nativity scene infuses any one of those secular
8 symbols, Santa Claus, the talking wishing well,

or the

9 reindeers, with a religious meaning of its own merely
10 because the nativity scene is close to it by its
11
12

proximity.
QUESTIONS

Hell, the city then could not

13 display religious paintings or artifacts in its museum
14 under your theory.
15

MR. DE LUCAs

No, that wouldn't be the case.

16 I think that the primary purpose in displaying religious
17 artifacts in a museum is to educate.

The city in

18 displaying artifacts which may include religious
19 artifacts did not necessarily —
20
21

QUESTION:

But according to you the effect

would be the same, regardless of the purpose.

22

MR. DE LUCAs

23

QUESTION:

Well, but I think —

Children would come to the museum,

24 and be somehow induced to think that the city was
25 supporting the religious symbols that were displayed.

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

MR. DE LUCA*

1

But the setting is completely

2 different in a museum as it is from the display in
3 Pawtucket.

The display in Pawtucket is designed tc

4 attract children, to entice them, to make it appear with
5 Disney characters —
6

QUESTION*

Well, I suppose museums are

7 developed to try to entice and attract visitors,
8 including children.
9

MR. DE LUCA;

Yes, but not in the same way.

10 Museums are designed to educate children.
11

are designed to entertain children.

The displays

At the same time as

12 they are being entertained, they are also being exposed
13 to a symbol that has very significant religious
14 significance.
15

So I think there is a clear difference between

16 the museum,

just as this Court in Schemp made the

17 distinction between having a — Bible readings take
18

place in the morning as opposed to utilizing the Bible

19 as an educational tool.
20
21

Certainly the teacher could utilize the Bible
to inculcate religion during the course of the day.

22 However, in the setting that the Bible was utilized in
23 Schemp, this Court made the finding that there was a
24 violation of the establishment clause, and I think that
26 it is analogous, that is, this — our case is analogous

38
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

to that in terms of the setting that it is depicted in.
Bealizing that this Court must apply the

2

3 clearly erroneous standard to the District Court's
4 findings, the city articulates two other arguments.

One

5 is contextural and one is historical, and I believe that
6 I have

touched on, in answering some of your questions,

7 the argument that is made by the city as it relates to
8 contextural.

I would like to say that as it relates to

9 the historical argument. Justice O'Connor presented a
10 hypothetical to counsel which I think is very relevant
11
12

to this case.
If in fact the citizens of the city of

13 Pawtucket or the government of Pawtucket can erect a
14 nativity scene as it has in this case, then in order to
15 celebate a religious — or a holiday which they allege
16 has become secularized, and because of the
17 secularization of the holiday, a religious symbol is no
18 longer religious, even though its origin is religious,
19 then why cannot the city if at some point in time Easter
20 is declared a national holiday, or before Easter, on
21

Good Friday, when schools are let out, when businesses

22 are closed, why would not the city be allowed to erect
23 in a secular setting a cross or a crucifix?

Why net

24 display Easter bunnies and painted eggs and tulips,
25 whichi are indicative or represent the secularization or

39

AL0ER8ON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0900

1

the secular side of Easter along with the erection cf a

2 crucifix, since the crucifix really is the reason that
3 Easter is being celebrated?

And I think that that example or that

4

5 hypothetical really presents to the Court some very,

6 very difficult questions if it decides that the nativity
7 scene should not be taken out of this display, because

8 what will happen, the effect of this Court's decision
9

will really be to open Pandora's box.
QUESTION:

10
11

Do we know — Do we know that the

kind of display that you just suggested at Easter, on

12 Good Friday, would not be permitted?

ME. DE LUCA:

13
14

It would be my suggestion that

it would not be permitted, that —

15

QUESTION:

Has this Court ever —

16

MR. DE LUCA:

No, that is why this case is

17 here.

QUESTION:

18
19

No, I am talking about Easter now.

I am talking about your Easter analogy.

We don't knew

20 whether that would or would not violate the religion
21

clauses, do we, the establishment clause?

22

MR. DE LUCA:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. DE LUCA:

25 is no.

I wouldn't --

We don't know judicially.
Based upon — The direct answer

Eased upon the decisions that this Court has

1

rendered, my — I would feel very strongly that such a

2 display would he a violation of the First Amendment,
3

just as the nativity scene is in this context.

4 opens the door.
5

But it

It opens the door to a variety of

problems for this Court, for the courts of this country ,

6 because if — The simplest solution

to this problem, and

7 I am not by saying it is simple suggesting that it is

8 insignificant, or that this case is insignificant, but
9 the simplest solution to this problem is to say, enough,
10 this is where we draw the line, because if the line

11 isn't drawn here, then groups all over this country
12 would have the right to come into government, to the

13 executive branch of government and say, I want to
14 celebrate my religious holiday, and I want you to
15 financially support a symbol that I feel is significant
18 to me in the celebration of my religious holiday.
17

And if that happens, then this Court and the

18 courts in this country will be inundated with suits in
19 order to determine whether there is a violation of the
20 First Amendment.
21
22

QDESTIOHj

But, Kr. Deluca, isn't that problem

also present in your position?

Because we asked your

23 opponent about, suppose there was nothing but a creche,
24 and I'd like to ask you, supposing the creche was just
25 one ornament on the Christmas tree and you could hardly

41

AL0ER8ON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

see it unless you looked very closely, would that be

2 illegal?
3
4

SR. DE LUCAi

If the creche is owned by the

city of Pawtucket, yes, it would be illegal, because it

5 is an acknowledgement of a religious symbol.

It is an

6 acknowledgement of a religious belief.

7

QUESTION*

Well, if it is so — if it is so

8 obscure that very few of the visitors to the scene even
9 see it, then how do you distinguish the museum case
10 where you've got some religious paintings in the
11
12

museum?
MR. DE LUCA*

Well, I don't think the

13 obscurity of the symbol has — with all due respect, has
14 anything to do with whether or not government is
15 sponsoring or advancing religion.
18
17

QUESTION*

What if they had three wise men and

a star in one exhibit, say?

18

MR. DE LUCA*

19

QUESTION*

Would that be enough?

As a — with a —

You are going to have a line

20 drawing problem no matter what you do.
21

MR. DE LUCA*

22

QUESTION*

I'm sorry.

What if you had an exhibit that had

23 not the creche itself, but just three camels out in a
24 desert and a star up in the sky?
25

MR. DE LUCA*

Well, then what we need in order

42
ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

to interpret those three symbols or four symbols, the

2 three wise men and the star, is a key.
3 secondary meaning to those symbols.
4

There is a

The star in and of

itself has no religious significance whatsoever.

In

5 order for me to understand that that is a star -QUESTIONS

6

Well, a lamb doesn't have any

7 religious significance, and a barn doesn't.

I mean, you

8 can make the same argument about all the elements of the
9 creche .

MR. DE LUCA;

10
11

With the exception of the child,

the baby Jesus in the manger, and the two — and the

12 Virgin

Mary and St. Joseph.
QUESTIONS

13

Well, that could be any mother and

14 father in that —

MB. DE LUCA;

16

Well, it could be, but the

16 difference between the nativity scene and separating
17 each one of those symbols and — is that in order to
18 appreciate the religious significance of the star, for
19 example, as I started to say, you need a key to unlock
20 the religious significance of the star.
21

It could mean

a —

22

QUESTION;

I think you need a key for the

23 creche .
24

MR. DE LUCA:

26

QUESTIONS

No —

I don't think every child who has

440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

not been brought up in the Christian tradition would

2

understand its meaning.

3

MR. DE LUCA:

4

QUESTION:

No --

There is nothing self-explanatory

5 about a creche to somebody, as Justice Stevens says, to
6 someone who has never been exposed to the Christian
7 religion.

MR. DE LUCA:

8

9 differ, Mr.

Well, with all -- I would beg to

Justice Rehnquist. First of all, the record

10

supports that there is something very different about

11

the creche.

The people who are contained in the creche,

12 the symbols, the three wise men, the shepherds, are all
13 kneeling in adoration of the child,

and the District

14 Court made those specific findings, that the creche —
15

in looking at the creche you can have — no other reason

16 or interpretation could be gleaned from viewing the
17

creche, that here is a religious symbol that — and that

18

is personified or represented by the adoration and the

19 worshipful positions that are taken by the symbols in

20 the display, so that the creche by itself, I think,
21
22

would —
QUESTION:

To say someone is on their knees

23 certainly does not import an exclusively religious
24 connotation.
25

It could be a temporal scene.

I mean,

people are on their knees before kings, emperors —

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

MR. DE LUCAi

Well, I think that the creche,

2 and the creche in this case, and any creche that I have
3 ever seen would lend credence to the position that it is
4 not temporal but in fact worshipful, that the appearance

5 of the figures in the display are in a worshipful
6 position, and not simply kneeling down for convenience
7 or for comfort.

They are there to adore the Christian

8 Messiah.

QUESTION*

9

Well, that is probably true for

10 anyone exposed to the Christian religion, but I think
11

what Justice Stevens was trying to ask you and what I

12 have been trying to ask you is for someone who has net
13 been schooled in that religion.

MR. DE LUCA:

14
15 about

Christianity?

For someone who knows nothing

Then I — if someone has absolutely

18 no knowledge of the birth of Christ and of
17 Christianity’s beginnings,

and looking at this

18 particular display by themselves, I think that they
19 could

import or — the display would import some

20 religious or have some religious overtones.
21

QUESTION:

Mr. Deluca —

22

MR. DE LUCA:

23

QUESTION:

Yes?

— would the display up on the

24

frieze in this courtroom of

the Ten Commandments be

25

unconstitutional then, in your view?

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

MR. DE LUCA

1

No, it would not be

2 unconstitutional in my view.

I believe that the Ten

3 Commandments as contained in the frieze in this
4 courtroom is not put there to advance religion.

I

5 believe that it, in conjunction with other aspects of

6 the freeze, it is intended to suggest the beginnings of
7 law, the codification of law and how it began.
QUESTIONS

8

Well, that is the argument, of

9 course, of the city, that the display of the nativity
10

scene is there to explain the origins of the Christmas

11

holiday observation.

12

MR. DE LUCAs

But I think, that in this setting

13 here in this courtroom, the Ten Commandments in and of
14 themselves do not suggest or advance religion, nor would
15 anyone suggest that the purpose of having the Ten
16 Commandmets in this courtroom is this Court's attempt to
17 advance religion.

Conversely, the Ten Commandments in

18 Stone versus Graham, of course, was found to be a
19 violation of the establishment clause because of its
20 setting, and because of the use that it was being put to.
21

This Court found, as you know, that the

22 utilization of the Ten Commandments, even though the
23 avowed

purpose put in there by the school or by the

24 state was merely to inculcate in children morals and a
25 knowledge of the Ten Commandments, contained religious

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.WM WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

references to God and "Thou shalt not have strange gods

2 before me," and a variety of other religious references,
3 and on

that basis the Court found that there was a

4 violation of the establishment clause.

I think that, as I said earlier, ultimately

5

6 the courts will be asked to decide in each instance
7 whether the erection of various religious symbols are
8 permissible.
9

An affirmance in this case will make clear

to government, to people of this country of all

10 religious persuasions, that sponsorship of religious
11

symbols is not the business of government, and that

12 government represents all people equally on the basis of
13

their citizenship, and not on the basis of their

14 religious affiliation.
15

Thank you.

It is respectfully submitted that just as

The respondents i n oral argument here have

stress ed the circumstances surrounding the religious

4 elemen t as determinative of its constitutional effect,
5 That,

we would respectfully submit, is precisely what

6 the co urts below refused to do in this case.
7

The

Distri ct Court stated that the city was overemphasizing

8 the im portance of context i n evaluating the
9

consti tutional import of a symbol, and we respectfully

10

submit that as respondent’s argument has demonstrated

11

here t oday,

it is impossibl e to overstate the importance

12 of con text, because context makes the symbol what it is.
13

In response to qu estions of the Chief Justice ,

I voul d submit that the leg islative prayers, the public

15

prayer s of the first Congre ss and the Thanksgiving
