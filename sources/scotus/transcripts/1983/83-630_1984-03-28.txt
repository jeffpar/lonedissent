ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. HITCHCCCK4

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

Eleven years ago in the case of In Re

12

Griffiths, this Court held that it was a violation of

13

the equal protection clause for a state to require

14

United

16

17

state may constitutionali require citizenship as a

18

condition for being licensed as a notary public.

The question before the Court

The Petitioner in this case is a lawful

20

resident alien who in 1978 applied to the Texas state

21

authorities for a license as a notary public, and he

22

desired to use license in connection with his job as a

23

paralegal with a legal aid organization in Texas.

24

state authorities denied his application solely on the

25

basis that he was not a United States citizen and

This Court has indicated that in assessing

3
4

state classifications and restrictions involving aliens,

5

the general standard of review is strict scrutiny,

6

although there are exceptions in some areas.

7

example, the Court has held that states are able tc deny

8

aliens certain rights, such as voting or running for

9

elective office.

For

And especially pertinent for today's case is

10
11

the Court's holdings that citizenship may be a relevant

12

factor if the state imposes the restriction in

13

connection with certain appointive positions where the

14

individual is exercising powers of the state that go to

15

the heart of representative self-government.

16

position is that the statute in this case is to be

17

judged

18

but even under the more deferential standard applied for

19

certain cf these appcntive positions we are still

20

entitled to prevail.

Let me focus for a minute, if I may, on the

22

qualifications it takes to become a notary public in

23

Texas and also on the nature of the function.

questions;

of the United States of America and Texas; are you a

6

you ever been convicted of a crime involving moral

There's a requirement of notifying the

of address.
What's interesting is what is not required.

10
11

There is no requirement that one say one is familiar

12

with what a notary does in Texas, nor, interestingly

13

enough , is there a requirement that the application be

14

notarized.
The functions of a notary are relatively

16

straightforward.

18

take depositions, and authenticate documents.

nature of the functions of this office are important

20

because the Court has discussed these in a number cf

21

situations when the lesser standard of review has been

QUESTION;

And the

Do those functions differ much from

the functions cf notaries public generally?
MR. HITCHCOCK;

No, they are rather similar to

the functions of notary publics.

2

the functions that Mr. Bernal performed when he was a

3

notary public in Indiana four years, and they’re alsc

4

identical to the functions that are performed by

5

commissioners of the superior court, an office to which

6

lawyers are appointed in Connecticut, which was in the

7

Griffiths case.

Mr. Hitchcock, what difference does

it make that the notaries public in Texas are
constitutional officers —

11

MR. HITCHCOCK;

12

QUESTION:

13

They are similar to

In our view —

-- as opposed to statutory

authorization, such as in Griffiths?
MR. HITCHCOCK:

14

In our view. Justice O'Connor,

15

there is no difference between the fact that an office

18

is created in the constitution and the fact that the

17

office, such as commissioner of the superior court, is

18

created by statute.

19

QUESTION:

20

Well, does it indicate that the

state considers the office more imprtant?
MR. HITCHCOCK:

21

I would say it indicates that

22

the state does consider the office slightly more

23

important.

24

nature of what the statute and the constitutional

25

provision are involved here.

But I think it’s important to focus on the

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

In the first place, the Texas constitution

1
2

merely states that the office is created,

and there is

3

discretion that is left to the legislature to decide the

4

qualifications, the standards, what regulation should be

5

imposed .
Interestingly enough for this case, the

6
7

state's argument that this is an important position

8

because it is in the state constitution really cuts both

9

ways.

It took a century before, until 19U5 at least,

10

that a residency requirement was imposed by the Texas

11

legislature, that one be a citizen of the state, an

12

ambiguous phrase at the time.

13

States was not required until 1965.

14

the argument does cut both ways.

15

Citizenship of the United

One final point, if I may.

So in that sense

The state's

16

argument that this is an important post because it's in

17

the constitution has the problem with it that what the

18

state is saying in effect is that, we have greater

19

discretion to discriminate provided we name the post in

20

our state constitution.

21

authority that gives the state that leeway, and there

would be the potential hazard that states

specifically on what a commissioner of the superior

Now, the

Despite the very grandiose name, the

What's important about Griffiths and important

17
18

about the restriction with respect to commissioners cf

19

the superior court is that the State of Connecticut in

20

Griffiths raised precisely the same arguments that are

21

being advanced here, that lawyers as commissioners cf

22

the superior court are being entrusted with the actual

23

performance of government power and that the state has

24

given meaning to the phrase that they are officers cf

25

the court.

8

And this Court answered the question in

1
2

lan gua ge which we think is highly pertinent here, where

3

the Co urt said that giving a lawyer the authority tc

4

issue writs and subpoenas cr to witness signatures or tc

5

admini ster oaths is not a matter of state policy or a

6

matter cf such unique responsibility that only citizens

7

can be entrusted with that responsibility.
In light of the similarities between what

8
9

Texas notaries public do and Connecticut commissioners

10

of the superior court do, we .submit that Griffiths is

contro lling and that the statute should be judged on

case,

2

the state's argument, an alien in the State cf Texas can

3

go to law school, can be admitted to the Texas bar, can

4

practice law, and can draft a whole host of legal

5

documents that have a significant impact on the public.

6

But that alien, that lawyer, will not be able to

7

notarize the documents that he or she has drafted.

8

believe that this anomaly is inconsistent with the equal

protection standards of this Court and that it should be

Under

He

struck down under the strict scrutiny test.
Let me turn now, if I may, to the state's

12

argument that a more deferential standard of review is

13

appropriate here because we’re dealing with an office

14

involving execution or formulation of policy factors

15

that go to the heart of representative self-government.

16

This Court indicated in Sugarman against

17

Dougall and most recently in Cabell versus Chavez-Salido

18

that there are two standards that must be met.

19

in order to take advantage cf this more deferential

20

standard, the state must show that the restriction is

21

sufficiently tailored to meet its ends, that it's net

22

over-inclusive or under-inclusive; and secondly,

23

really are dealing with one of these significant

24

sovereign functions of the government.

25

First,

that we

The restriction in this case fails on both

counts.

The restriction is over-inclusive because it

2

denies qualified resident aliens such as Mr. Rernal, who

3

performed the functions of a notary for four years in

4

Indiana, the opportunity to get a commission.
And it’s also under-inclusive because there’s

2

common themes that run through the Court’s cases in

3

which this restriction, in which this lower standard,

4

more deferential standard, has been applied.

5

There are several

In the first case, the cases where the

6

standard has been applied involving policemen, school

7

teachers, deputy probation officers, all involved public

8

employees, state municipal employees, who were on a

9

public payroll.

10
11
12

QUESTION;

Dc you think all those cases are

consis tent?
MR. HITCHCOCK;

Well, I think that if some of

13

the cases had come out differently we would have an

14

easier time in this case, Justice Blackmun.

15

question leads me to the other common threads here.

16

What the Court has done is identified several important

17

functions, two important functions, law enforcement and

18

education, and has allowed there to be restrictions in

19

deference because of the importance of law enforcement

20

and education to the exercise of the state’s functions.

21

QUESTION:

But ycur

I suppose it’s fair to say the

22

Court’s been cutting back from what, a more extreme

23

position taken in Griffiths?

24
25

MB. HITCHCOCK;

Well, the restrictions have --

the last three cases have applied a more deferential

12

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Standard and have upheld the restrictions.

2

again is that this case is governed by strict scrutiny

3

and this discussion of the more deferential standard

4

comes in only if the Court says that strict scrutiny is

5

not applicable in this situation.
QUESTION*

6
7

10

Do you think this case can stand

without Griffiths in effect being overruled?
MR. HITCHCOCK*

8

9

Our position

No, Griffiths would have to be

overruled in order for the state to prevail in this
particular action.
The other thread that I was referring to is

11

12

that we are dealing with functions that go to the

13

sovereign functions of government, the exercise by the

14

state entrusting individuals with the performance cf

15

state functions.

16

power to build bridges, such as civil engineers do in

17

Flores de Otero, but when engineers build bridges

18

they're not exercising the sovereign function of the

19

state even though they're licensed by the state.

20

lawyers draft contracts, they may be licensed to dc

21

that, but they're not exercising sovereign power.

It*s one thing to give individuals the

22

I thought

roads and bridges were a sovereign function now in this

goes to —
QUESTION*

4
5

You mean the building of a road is

not exercising a sovereign power?
ME. HITCHCOCK*

6

Not in the sense that it has

7

been used in the descriptions, in the standards set

8

forth in the decisions of the Court.

9

building a road is regarded as a sovereign function, the

Conceivably, if

10

people who are building the road might be regarded as

sort of employees.
QUESTION*

12

Governments always have to hire

people to do their work.

15

him any less sovereign, does it?
ME. HITCHCOCK*

16

They even hire -- the governor

Chief Justice Burger, the

17

difference tends to be, as the Court recognized in

18

Sugarman, that there are differences between the

19

functions that are performed by different state

20

employ ees.

21

The point that I am making is that there is a

22

world of difference between the situation in which

23

policemen are authorized to make arrests and deprive

24

people of their liberty in the name of the state and the

25

situation in which a notary public is authorized to tell

14

2

witness a signature on a document.

3

distinction which is important, which separates this

4

case from the cases where the more deferential standard

5

has been applied.

That is the

Finally, even if the Court should apply the

6
7

more deferential standard of review to this restriction

8

involving aliens, we submit that we are still entitled
to prevail because there is no rational basis for this

10

particular blanket exclusion.

The state has presented

11

no evidence that excluding all aliens, discriminating

12

against all aliens, rationally advances the legitimate

13

state interest with respect to having documents

14

processed or the other interests that have been

15

identified in this case.
If the Court has no further questions at this

16
17

point,

we would respectfully like to reserve the

18

remainder of the time for rebuttal.

does the Texas office of notary public come within the

inquiry is, does the requirement of citizenship bear a

the office of notary public in its constitution,

10

beginning with the constitution of 18^5.

11

QUESTION:

Of what significance is that?

12

NS. KELLEP:

that historically Texas has considered the office of

QUESTION;

8

That is true, Your Honor.

There are quite a few more notaries

today than six per county, I take it?

MS. KELLER:

Yes, Your Honor, there are many

Texas and the need for many more public officeholders to

2

do the functions that the State of Texas has authorized

3

the notary to do.
QUESTION:

4

Nay I go back, to the 1845

5

constitution for a minute.

Are we to believe that that

6

provision really was enforced, that the notary was

7

appointed by and with the consent of the senate on a
two-thirds vote?
NS. KELLER:

Yes.
That must have been a busy

legislature.

14

NS. KELLER:

15

(Laughter.)

16

MS. KELLER:

Very busy legislature.

But it shows -- I think what all

17

this shows is that there is no set job of notary public

18

across the country; that in fact Texas has a special

19

place for its notary publics, notaries public; that it

20

gives them a great deal of authority; that it puts it in

21

its constitution; that it gives them a commission of the

22

state,

23

by the authority of the State of Texas, with the seal of

24

the State of Texas.

And as a matter of fact, Mr. Bernal testified

that the reason he wanted to be a notary is it would be

Texas considers the notary to be a

governmental function, and in the constitution,
historically, statutorily, it has consistently treated

it that way.

Once the state has defined the office cf

My reading of the

cases indicates that the Court would entertain other

legitimate interests that might be advanced by the

that it is what it said, what it purports to be, unless
