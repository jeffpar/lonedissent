Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Thank you, Your Honor.

Court:
We are here today in another in a line of

10

cases following this Court’s decision in North Carolina

11

v. Pearce in 1969 dealing with under what circumstances

12

may a trial judge impose a harsher sentence following

13

retrial and reconviction after a first conviction has

14

been reversed on appeal.

15

In Pearce this Court announced that double

16

jeopardy does not absolutely bar an enhancement of

17

sentence, but the Court also announced in Pearce that

18

due process requires that when a judge chooses to

19

enhance following a second conviction that

20

vindictiveness on his part must play no part in that

21

enhancement, and further that because a defendant may be

22

fearful when decided whether to take an appeal or not

23

that if he does and gets a new trial the sentence may be

24

enhanced because the judge is vindictive against him,

25

that the apprehension on the part of the defendant

of consideration from Judge Boettger?

11
12

Improper in what way?

Well, he could have, yes.

And if he had would this case be a

different case?
MR. M0SK0WITZ:

This case probably, I am sura,

19

would be a very different case because he certainly —

20

his basis — I will get to that in a moment, but his

21

basis for enhancing after the second trial was that I

24
25

Now it's a

QUESTION;

2
3

Do you see something illogical

about that?

4

NS. MOSKOWITZ;

5

QUESTION;

That he didn't consider it?

That the first time, since it's

only a charge, why the sentencing judge will not

will take it into account.
10

Is that logical or

illogical?
MR. KOSKCWITZ;

11
12

Therefore, I

behind

It's — based on the rationale

Pearce, it's not illogical.

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. MOSKOWITZ :

Pearce —

It's not?
It's not illogical.

I think

15

that,

and I’ve been asked this question many times in

16

the Eleventh Circuit and other places, the difficulty

17

there is, and what the Eleventh Circuit addressed was,

18

that the defendant is somehow trying to, if you will,

1

according to the Eleventh Circuit language, have his

20

cake and eat it too.
He asks back then, hey, don't consider this

21
22

pending charge, and now he says you can't consider it.

23

The conduct predated my first sentencing, and if you

24

wanted to consider it you should have done it back

25

then.

That’s the argument that I've been faced a number

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

of tines
I think that the problem with that argument,

2
3

and I’m taking it a little bit out of order now, but

4

I'll address it now, the problem with that argument is

5

that the argument forgets there is another judge waiting

6

in tha wings fully able to take that into account, in

7

this case, and that if you will allow me to just develop

8

the facts a little further I'll show you that Judge

9

Davis,

the judge in the, what was the mail fraud case

10

and what ended up being a misdemeanor case, did have the

11

opportunity to sentence Wasman on those facts, and in

12

fact Judge Davis announced at the time of sentencing,

13

considered the other case, the Judge Roettger case.
QUESTIONi

14

Well, you're saying in effect that

15

the judge only gets one bite at the apple.

16

who is sentencing the person for the substantive

17

conviction takes the substantive conviction into

18

account, then another judge before whom he is found

19

guilty of another charge can't take into account the

20

alternate substantive conviction because he’s already

21

been sentenced on that.
MR. MOSKOWITZi

22
23
24
25

facts.

No.

If the judge

It depends upon the

In this particular case -QUESTION;

Well, what, then, is the inference

that you want us to draw from saying that Judge Davis

8

had already taken the mail fraud into consideration.

2

He’d taken it into consideration in sentencing him for

the mail fraud, hadn’t he?

That’s right.

but --

It was a misdemeanor case that was
But Judge Davis

As I said, I was jumping ahead a bit,

QUESTION:

9

Put — it.

But that would be true of every

10

single conviction that there ever was,

11

for which a person was sentenced to anything, that the

12

judge would have taken into consideration the nature of

13

the charges upon which the jury returned a guilty

14

verdie t.

15

MR. HOSKOWITZi

16

QUESTION:

I would think,

Yes.

And you’re saying that that having

17

happened another judge trying him for an independent

18

offense cannot take into consideration the fact that he

19

was convicted of a wholly independent charge in setting

20

the sentence.
MR. KOSKOWITZi

21

Not at all.

Not at all.

The

22

difference here is that Pearce sets out that in a

23

situation like this at a second sentencing, when a judge

24

wants to enhance a sentence over that he previously had

25

given,

he can’t consider conduct that predated the first

QUESTION*

2

Well, the Pearce rule may be one

3

thing.

But I thought you were arauing that it really —

4

that the "have your cake and eat it, too" argument

5

didn't make any sense here because Judge Davis had taken

6

into consideration the mail fraud conviction.
MR. M0SK0WITZ:

7

Not at all.

I’m sorry if I

8

gave that impression.

You know, when I was answering

9

Chief Justice Burger's question, was that if Judge

10

Roettger cannot take it into account the second time and

11

the first time.

12

into consideration the conviction.

I’m just saying Judge Davis did take

QUESTION*

13

But that doesn't answer the

14

argument, I think, of whether in the passport violation

15

charge at some point the -- either the pending charge or

16

the conviction for the mail fraud misdemeanor should be

17

considered by the judge sentencing for the passport

18

fraud.

19

misdemeanor took into consideration the misdemeanor is

20

no answer to the other charge.

21

To say that the judge sentencing for the

MR. M0SK0WITZ*

No, no.

Maybe I'm not making

22

myself clear.

What I am suggesting is that when Judge

23

Davis considered it, it answers the question that the

24

defendant is trying to skate through without the mail

25

fraud case ever being considered.

10

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

QUESTION:

1

Nc, I don't read Judge Markey's

2

language in the Court of Appeals as suggesting that the

3

defendant was complaining or that the state was

4

complaining that the mail fraud would never be

5

considered on the substance, but that so far as

6

augmenting is concerned, first it was too early and then

7

it was too late.
And I don't think the fact that Judge Davis

8
9
10

considered the charge in sentencing him really is an
answer to that.

11

MR. MOSKOWITZ;

12

QUESTION;

13

Except for the fact —

You're entitled to differ,

obviou sly.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:

14

Except for the fact that under

15

Pearce at the first go-around for Judge Roettger he

16

chose not to consider it, and again I readily concede I

17

think

18

at that time.

that he was right in choosing not to consider it

19

QUESTION:

Because it was not --

20

MR. MOSKOWITZ:

Because it had not — because

21

it had not ripened into a conviction.

22

charge.
QUESTION:

23

It was a pending

In other words, he was giving the

24

man the full benefit of the presumption of innocence,

25

wasn't he?

MR. M0SK0WITZ;

1
2

That's correct

That's

correc t.

QUESTION;

3

But you then say later on he cannot

4

take the conviction into account when the presumption of

5

innocence has been merged and washed out by the

6

convic tion.
MR. MOSKOWITZ;

7

Well, we are talking about in

8

this particular case the language in Pearce and when

9

that conduct occurred.

The conduct occurred five or six

10

years earlier.

I read Pearce to say that due process

11

reguires that a defend-ant when he decides whether to

12

take an appeal or not should be free of the apprehension

13

that a judge is going to be vindictive against him, and

14

those Court chose to put forth a rule to carry out that

15

belief by saying —

16

QUESTION;

What vindictiveness do you spell

17

out here?

Pearce indeed was a state of mind holding,

18

wasn't it -- a state of mind of vindictiveness on the

19

part of the judge?
MR. M0SK0WITZ;

20

Pearce had a two-pronged

21

holding, or two-pronged reason for its test; one, that

22

we want to keep judges from being vindictive; and, two,

23

we want defendants who when choosing to take an appeal

24

should

25

vindictive against him.

not be fearful of a judge coming back and being

1
2

QUESTION;

Where do you see the vindictiveness

here?

ME. MOSKOWITZ;

3

I don't think I necessarily

4

have to see the vindictiveness.

5

pointed out in Blackledge v. Perry and other cases that,

8

number one, it's nigh on to impossible for a defendant

7

to ever show in the record that a judge was vindictive

8

against him. . I don’t think we’re ever going to see a

9

case where a judge says I’m going to enhance your

10

I think this Court's

sentence because you took it up on appeal and beat me.
QUESTIONi

11

So you think that the prophylactic

12

nature of the Pearce rule is such that if at the initial

13

trial the trial judge takes into effect those prior

14

convictions shown on the rap sheet, he’s got two, say,

15

he’s got two and he takes those into account.
But the judgment is reversed.

16

There is a

17

retrial and he comes to the sentencing phase again and

18

it turns out that he's now got a rap sheet that the

19

first one was just wrong.

20

times,

21

four convictions in sentencing the second time?

six times.

He’s been convicted five

Must he ignore those other three or

22

I would think you would say he has to.

23

MR. MOSKOWITZ:

24

QUESTION;

25

MR. MOSKOWITZ;

It depends on —

Well, what could it depend on?
When the conduct that gave

QUESTION;

2

Well, the conduct has all happened,

3

before -- all those convictions happened before his

4

first

MR. MOSKOWITZ;

5

6

conviction?
Under the prophylactic rule in

Pearce, yes.
QUESTION;

7

So he may never, ever then have a

8

sentence at the second trial that takes into account all

9

of what would have been valid considerations at the

10

first;

is that —
MR. M0SK0WITZ;

11

That’s true, except for the

12

fact that it misses the point that the defendant is not

13

escaping punishment.
QUESTION:

14

Other judges who have -Well, he’s escaping the punishment

15

that could have validly been imposed on him at the first

16

trial,

17
18
19

20

except for some other trial error.
MR. M0SK0WITZ;

Okay.

You’re assuming that

the rap sheet was incorrect.
QUESTION;

Yes.

Well, I take it you think the

prophylactic —

21

MR. MOSKOWITZ;

22

QUESTION;

The prophylactic — well --

Forbids at the second trial taking

23

into account things that could have been taken into at

24

the first trial but were erroneously excluded.

25

MR. MOSKOWITZ;

I read Pearce --

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Moskowitz, what is some event

2

occurs after the first trial that's favorable to the

3

defendant, for instance a prior conviction is reversed

4

and set aside by an appellate court and so bv the time

5

of tie retrial in your situation the sentencing judge

6

after the retrial, can he consider the fact that now

7

there is one less prior conviction?

8

MR. M0SK0WITZ:

9

QUESTION;

It helps the defendant, doesn't it?

10

MR. MOSKOWITZ:

11

QUESTION:

12

true,

too?

13

it either way?

Certainly, certainly.

Well, then why isn't the reverse

Why shouldn't the judge be able to consider

MR. MOSKOWITZ:

14

I certainly think he could.

Getting back to the reason

15

behind the rule set out in Pearce, the reason, as this

16

Court enunciated in Pearce and in prior -- in subsequent

17

opinions from Pearce was to take fear of vindictivenss

18

out of the defendant’s mind when he chooses whether he

19

should

take an appeal or not.
QUESTION;

20

Well, he ought to be able to be at

21

peace with the knowledge that whatever happens

22

afterwards the court can consider it, whether it helps

23

him or hurts him -- any event.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:

24
25

Whatever happens, whatever he

does.

QUESTION*

In any event.

UR. MOSKOWITZt

The way I read Pearce is

essentially it puts the ball, so to speak, in the

defendant’s lap.

6

he knows what’s going to happen.

7

future bad act, he knows what’s going to happen,

8

and it’s going to be just the opposite of what he

wants.

10

The defendant is able after the first

It puts the ball in his court, so to speak.
QUESTION:

Well, of course, literally read in

11

this case what was taken into account was something that

12

happened after his first conviction.

13

14

is — that is not a non-event, is it?

15
16

MR. MOSKOWITZs

QUESTION:

18

MR. MOSKOWITZs

Well, we come right down to

the meaning of —

question is is it conduct on his part.

19

Literally read, he

Isn’t it?

Isn’t it?

We come right down to the

meaning of the word "conduct" in Pearce.
QUESTION:

But if you read Pearce as trying to

24

set up barriers to vindictiveness, how can you spell out

25

any vindictiveness on the part of the judge here,

16

prove vindictiveness.

6

motivations on the part of judges, lawyers in going back

and doing something again and trying a case again, and

8

it is virtually — it would be virtually impossible.

Goodwin, the Court pointed out how difficult it is to

judge.

13

like I said before, on the record I’m enhancing your

14

sentence because I didn’t like you taking the appeal the

15

first time around.

16

I don’t think any trial judge is going to say,

QUESTION i

I take it you then would also say

17

Pearce would prevent the trial judge taking into account

18

another conviction that occurred while the case was on

19

appeal, based on conduct that was never known at all

20

until after his first conviction?

MR. M0SK0WITZ;

No, I think that certainly

22

think that there is a split in the circuits as to how to

interpret the language "subsequent conduct" as written

I read Pearce in a line along with the Second

Pearce test was formulated to take this fear of

allow the defendant when he chooses to appeal or not to

know that the ball is in his lap.
In this case, taking a look at the facts in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ

ON BEHALF CF RESPONDENT

MR. HOROWITZ;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;
I don't want to belabor this discussion that

5

6

has gone on quite a bit already about the nature of

7

taking into account the intervening conviction here, but

8

I would like to say two things about it.
The main thing, I think, is that this is all

9

10

quite beside the point.

11

whether Judge Poettger really gave an appropriate

12

sentence here because Judge Davis had already taken

13

things into account, the matter was already before Judge

Petitioner has made a lot of

Mr. Wasman is an old man.
The question for the Court is not to review

16

the appropriateness of Judge Roettger's sentence.

17

is a constitutional case, and the only question is

18

whether the due process clause was violated by the

19

increase of the sentence after retrial.

20

This

I'd like to begin by talking a little bit

21

about the factual background here because I think the

22

statements that were made in the record at the two

23

sentencing proceedings pretty clearly indicate that

24

there was no conceivable process violation.

25

At the first sentencing hearing the government

25

I think it’s quite clear

7

opportunity to tell his story and connects him with the

respectfully suggest it's net appropriate for the

10

government to be arguing that Mr. Wasman’s entitled to

11

some sort of enhanced punishment in this passport case

12

13

Judge Was — excuse me, Judge Roettger agreed

with that and said it was his general policy not to take

pending charges into account.

2

violation of the due process clause
Petitioner's claim that there is a due process

3

violation rests entirely on North Carolina v. Pearce.

4

Pearce did recognize a due process limitation on

5

resentencing after appeal, but it certainly did not

6

impose an absolute ban on a higher sentence.

7

Quite the contrary, the Court explicitly

8

state! there at page 723 that a trial judge is not
constitutionally precluded from imposing a higher

10

sentence after a retrial in light of events subsequent

11

to the first trial which shed new light on the

12

sentencing decision.

13

QUESTION:

The term was "events".

14

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I was going to get to

15

that a little bit later, but there are two separate

16

statements in Pearce.

17

"events" subsequent to the first trial, and at a later

18

point it refers to conduct on behalf of the defendant.

1

So there is certainly some ambiguity as to exactly what

20

the Court meant.

21

Once the Court uses the term

What Pearce did hold is that it violates due

22

process to impose a greater sentence in retaliation for

23

the defendant's exercise of his right to appeal.

25

vindictive motivation, whether conscious or, more

chilling the right to appeal by assuring defendants that

3

such vindictive resentencing will not be allowed, the

such a sentence increase unless justified by specific

reasons placed on the record by the sentencing judge.

7

Now it's clear beyond doubt from Pearce and

in Pearce set for a prophylactic rule prohibiting

8

from the other due process cases that have followed it

0

that the concern there is with preventing actual

10

vindictiveness, in this context an increased sentence

11

that is imposed actually in retaliation for the taking

12

of an appeal.

13

This danger arises because of the human

14

element that is involved in resentencing.

possible and difficult to determine from the record

16

a judge will in fact harbor some vindictive motivation,

QUESTION ;

Even thouch the -- after that

5

decision defendants might have a realistic fear of being

6

sentenced to a longer sentence after appeal.
MR. HOROWITZ;

7

That's right.

So the so-called

8

chilling effect that Pearce is concerned with is an

9

unfair chilling effect that defendants may be worried

10

that they're going to get an unfair higher sentence

11

later,

a vindictive higher sentence.
3ut there is nothing unfair about them taking

12

13

the risk of getting a valid higher sentence later, and

14

Pearce and the due process clause does not protect

15

against that possibility.
I won't read it again here, but I think this

16
17

is stated quite clearly by the Court in Chaffin at page

18

25 and

19

the fact that in Pearce the possibility of a higher

20

sentence was recognized and accepted as as legitimate

21

concomitant of the retrial process.

22

sentence is increased for valid, non-vindictive reasons,

23

no Pearce problem is presented.

24
25

the three printed pages 16 to 17 of our brief,

Thus, when a

As the Court explained in Goodwin, the rule of
Pearce simply imposes a presumption of vindictiveness.

30
ALDEASON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

This alleviates the practical difficulty of proving

2

motivation for the defendant, but it is not an absolute

3

rule.

4

clearLy dispell tie realistic possibility of

5

vindictiveness by demonstrating a valid reason for the

6

increase, there should be no bar to the imposition of a

7

higher sentence on retrial.

When the circum stances of a particular case

Now petitioner's contention here is that the

8
9

only reason that can validly be used to impose a higher

10

sentence on retrial is one that is based on conduct on

11

the part of the defendant that occurs subsequent to the

12

first trial.
Now putting aside for one moment what the

13
14

opinion in Pearce has to say about that, I would like to

15

point out that there's been no explanation as to why the

16

due process should require such a rule.

17

fully

18

simply makes no sense with respect to the policies that

19

underlie Pearce and the overall thrust of the decision.

20

I think as we

explained our brief this sort of distinction

If this sort of distinction does apply, it

21

would have quite undesirable consequences in the

22

sentencing process without advancing the policies of the

23

due process clause one iota.

24

examples of that.

25

And I’d like to give a few

One is the example that is given in this case,

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

after the first sentence was imposed by the judge.

3

he has additional information before him that suggests

allowed to take this into account.

Now

defendant perhaps deserves a higher sentence.

This is highlighted in this case and perhaps

7

more agregiously in the Williams case in the Ninth

9

Circuit, if you look at the facts of that case, a case

10

where

the Court found the conduct language in Pearce to

15

by Justice White, where in fact nothing happens after

16

17

that wasn't available the first time around.

18

learn that the defendant has quite a long rap sheet and

19

really is a much more serious offender than was thought

20

before .

Then we

21

And finally I think an important situation to

22

be taken into account and one that has come before this

23

Court before in Michigan v. Payne -- the case where the

24

defendant pleads guilty and is sentenced on the basis of

25

a guilty plea.

The Court has recognized many times that

*

32

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

judges usually impose leniency when a guilty plea is

2

enter.e d.
Now sometimes the defendant may collaterally

3
4

attack

5

to trial a second time if he succeeds in that attack.

e

Now it just simply doesn't make any sense that the judge

7

should be restricted to the sentence that he imposed the

8

first time, the lenient sentence that he imposed on the

9

basis of the guilty plea, when the defendant ends up

10

going

the validity of his guilty plea and

ultimately ao

to trial.
Now to digress for a moment as to exactly what

11
12

the opinion in Pearce says, I think there are three

13

different basic kinds of situations here.

14

there's actual conduct, bad acts, by the defendant after

15

the first trial.

16

higher sentence on retrial would be permissible if based

17

on such conduct.

One is where

The petitioner himself agrees that a

The second class is where some event takes

18
19

place after trial.

That would be this case, I believe,

20

where the conviction has been entered but in fact there

21

was no bad act committed by the defendant during that

22

time.

23

It's our position, as we explain in our brief,

24

that the Court in Pearce contemplated that an event such

25

as that, such as the one in this case, would equally be

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

5

trial.

Petitioner

But, as I say, our position is that everything

6

in Pearce is fully consistent with affirming the Court

7

of Ap'peals here.

8

9

Now there is a third class of cases, the
hypothetical suggested by Justice White, where there's

10

really no event after the first trial ends, but there is

11

new information that comes to light that would seem to

12

justify a higher sentence.

13

Now in our view such information should also

14

be grounds for imposing a higher sentence if it in fact

15

justifies the higher sentence.

16

opinion in Pearce suggests that in fact the Court did

17

not contemplate that such information would be available

18

and wa suggested in our brief that that is dictum and

19

that the Court ought to reconsider it here.

20

I think a reading cf the

We're not really asking the Court to come up

21

with a rule one way or the other, but more or less to

22

back away from what it said before and leave these kind

23

of questions to be decided by the lower courts.

Well, I —

It wasn't intended to be a

mechanical rule where you just touch a computer.

6

court didn't have the information at one point but had

6

information, adverse information, that was relevant to a

7

sentence, Pearce — I do not read Pearce as precluding

8

the use of that.

9

HR. HOROWITZ*

Well,

If the

I hope you're right, Mr.

10

Chief Justice.

certainly some of the language in the opinion of Pearce

12

suggests that if no event occurs —

All I was saying is that there is

Some each way.

There's some

language each way in that respect.
HR. HOROWITZ*

Well,

there's language each way

16

as far as the conduct of the defendant.

But as far as

17

the requirement that something occur after the first

18

trial, there is nothing in the opinion in Pearce that

19

would authorize a higher sentence at that point.

20

We think that in all these situations --

23

This third situation you're really

asking just for an advisory opinion, I take it.
MR. HOROWITZ;

We're not really asking for an

24

advisory opinion.

What we're asking for is for the

25

Court to back away from its previous advisory opinion

You’re saying that our prior advice

was un reliable?
YE. HOROWITZ;

4

Unreliable, not necessarily

5

wrong.

I'm not saying it’s wrong, just that it's an

6

open question at this point.
QUESTION ;

7

What you really want us to do is

8

construe Pearce and the cases that have come since then

9

as not providing for any relief for the petitioner here;

10

isn’t that the net of it?
MR. HOROWITZ:

11

Well, certainly in this case I

12

think under any reading of Pearce the petitioner is not

13

entitled to relief here.

14

on the facts here there was any vindictiveness.

15

could hardly have a stronger case for dispelling the

16

vindictiveness in this case.

It’s just inconceivable that

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

MR. MOSKOWITZ;

Do you have anything further, Hr.

A couple of comments, Your

H o n cr.

24

Not to belabor the point, but I think

Pearce talks not just of actual vindictiveness.

that
It also

1

talks about a defendant's state of mind following his

2

first conviction, a state of mind at the time when he

3

has to make a determination as to whether he should take

4

an appeal or not.
Pearce says,

5

Pearce states and in Blackledga

6

v.

Ferry it's expounded upon, that fear of

7

vindictiveness is as important as removing

8

vindictiveness itself, and that it is not always

9

possible and not always required that a defendant

10

actually prove vindictiveness in order to succeed.

11

One of the things — Mr. Horowitz laid out

12

certain hypotheticals and one I just want to let the

13

Court know that I'm in complete agreement with, and that

14

is his guilty plea situation, that a man enters a guilty

15

plea, withdraws it, then goes to trial and is

16

con vi c ted .

17

In-between the time of his first sentencing on

18

the guilty plea and the second sentencing on the

19

conviction, something else happens.

20

plea situation withdrawn or overturned on some kind of

21

an appeal to be nothing more than the withdrawal of a

22

plea bargain, and certainly a judge who may have been

23

lenient the first time around can give whatever sentence

24

the judge thinks appropriate the second time around.

25

I find the guilty

That really, I don't think, falls within the

I’m just saying that under the guidance and

guidelines of Pearce the punishment should not be

enhanced based on previous conduct.
It seems that we’re really talking here about

12

a fortuitous event in the Wasman situation, the

not dictate how we rule, and I ask the Court to not send

the case back but just send the case back for
