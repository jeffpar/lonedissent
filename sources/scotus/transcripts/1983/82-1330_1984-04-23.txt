ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. ECYE, III, ESC.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BOYD;

please

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the Court, the ultimate question which we are

10

here abcut today is to resolve whether the respondent

11

was denied his rights under the double jeopardy clause

12

of the Fifth Amendment when he was indicted, tried, and

13

convicted of manslaughter by culpable negligence.
Our discussion this morning will focus on

14
15

three principal areas.

The first is the appropriate

16

federal or constitutional standard to be applied in this

17

case.

18

post-conviction relief herein, which was without

19

opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court has never

20

addressed the question of whether reckless driving is a

21

lesser included offense of manslaughter by culpable

22

negligence.

23

the Fifth Circuit Ccurt of Appeals has misconstrued the

24

law of

25

reckless driving was a lesser included offense.

Two, that with the exception of the denial of

And three, that bcth the District Ccurt and

the state of Mississippi when they held that

1

Nr. Boyd, may I ask about the law

of Mississippi?

to the time of the accident?
MR. BOYD:

5

When did this death occur in relation

The death occurred instantaneously

with the accident.

6

QUESTION:

Instantaneously?

7

HE. BOYD:

Yes, sir.

8

QUESTION:

Well, in that circumstance under

9
10

Mississippi law could the state have tried both the
misdemeanor and the felony charges in one proceeding?

11

NR. BOYD:

No, sir.

12

QUESTION:

They cculd not?

13

MR. EOYD:

No, sir.

Let me qualify that with

QUESTION:

Well, was there ary Mississippi

21

statute that required the trial of those charges, the

22

misdemeanor charges, in the justice of the peace court

23

independently of any other court?

24
25

NR. EOYD:

None that would require it.

However, as I pointed cut in the reply to the brief cf

amicus in this matter, that in Stenson v.

State, which

2

has been recently decided by cur Supreme Court, they

3

have held that it was a -- that the conviction was

4

reversible where the individual was indicted in a

5

multi-count indictment.

6

In other words, we cannot charge more than one

7

charge per indictment, nor can we try under Stenscr more

8

than one charge per case unless it is with the agreement

9

of the parties, which was dene so in this case on appeal

10

from the misdemeanor.
So, unlike the federal government, or unlike

11

12

the federal procedure under the Federal Rules cf

MR. BOYD:

The next session was in December.

QUESTION :

So the delay in the charge of the

At that time they could net be

The grand jury was called at

the beginning of the court session, and things of this

This is correct.

In actuality what

happened, the Fifth Circuit found that this was the

to pass something to the files, which is the functional

MR. BOYD:

another particular aspect of Mississippi procedure.

Under Section S9.35.14E of the Mississippi Cede,
/

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

we have

1

a procedure by which, or up until last week we had a

2

procedure by which you file a petition cr an application

3

for leave to proceed in the court which had last

4

jurisdiction in the case.
In other words, if you take an appeal to the

5
6

Mississippi Supreme Court, then that is the court which

7

had last jurisdiction, and you file an application for

8

leave to proceed to file a petition for writ of error

9

coram nobis in the lower court.

The court then reviews

10

this petition to determine whether cr net probable cause

11

has been stated for review.

12

then the court will deny the application and there will

13

be no remand to the lower court.

If probable cause has net,

And that is what was filed here?

MR. BOYD;

Yes, sir.

18

MR. BOYD;

And denied without opinion.

QUESTION;

And then to the federal court?

20

MR. BOYD;

And then into U.S. District Ccurt.

I have no question tut

determine whether cr net exhaustion had taken place.

2

There is no question about exhaustion in this case.

3

will parenthetically add that the order entered by the

4

Mississippi Supreme Court in this case has recently teen

5

interpreted to include procedural bars, that is, under

6

Wainwright versus Sikes as decided by this Court.

I

7

However, at the time frame in which this case

8

came up, I must candidly admit that under Ulster Ccunty

9

Court versus Allen, the state did not proceed under the

10

theory

of procedural bar, so consequently we do net

11

argue it here.
The Fifth Circuit and the District Court both

12

13

relied

14

test articulated by this Court in Blockburger versus the

15

United States, the same evidence test.

16

expounded upon by Justice White in his opinion in

17

Vitalii v. Illinois is that the state is not precluded

18

from prosecuting respondent notwithstanding the fact

19

that there was a substantial overlap in proof required

20

to prove both the crimes of reckless driving and

21

manslaughter by culpable negligence because each offense

22

requires proof of a statutory element the other does

23

net.

24
25

on deciding the double jeopardy question upon the

Cur position as

In Albernaz versus United States, Whalen
versus the United States, this Court indicated that the

1

test articulated in Plcckburger was a rule cf statutory

2

construction .

3

construction to the case at tar, we find that the

4

application of the test should focus, one,

5

statutory situation in which we found in Vitalii.

11

Vitalii, the state of Illinois had a specific statute

dealing with the reckless use cf an automobile, of a

13

motor vehicle.

14

Instead, we have a general or omnibus statute dealing

15

with manslaughter or a catch-all statute.

specifically define various and sundry forms of

17

manslaughter in other statutes, and then say all other

homicides, including homicide by culpable negligence,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. BOYD, III, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF CF THE PETITIONERS - RESUMED

7

MR. BOYD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court, I want to clarify one point that I

9

think there was a misunderstanding on my part.

10

I

believe Justice O'Conner asked a question.
To clarify a procedural point, the state of

11
12

Mississippi could have indicted Mr. Roberts at this

13

time.

16

district in the state of Mississippi, processing over

17

4,0C0 criminal cases a year.

19

1

although it could have teen done in this case.
I want to direct my attention here in the last

2
3

few minutes to two points.

The first is that the Fifth

4

Circuit misconstrued the state — or the case of Smith

5

v. State in this situation.

6

Court has never addressed the question of whether

7

reckless driving was a lesser included or is a lesser

8

included offense to the offense of manslaughter ty

9

culpable negligence.

The Mississippi Supreme

10

The case cited by the Fifth Circuit applying

11

this judicial veneer as they call it was not in fact a

12

judicial veneer but was in fact addressing the

13

particular facts of that case to the law as it applied.

14

In particular, Smith v. State dealt with whether gross

15

negligence was sufficient, cr proof of gross neligence

16

was sufficient to prove culpable negligence under this

17

statute.

They held that it was not.
We also note that the Court has held that CWI

18
19

is not a lesser included offense to the crime of

20

manslaughter.

That was in Cutshall v. State.

Finally, we look to the legislative intent,

21

22

following the Albernaz line of reasoning.

23

we have separate statutes.

24

enacted in

1848.

25

enacted in

1938.

We note that

The manslaughter statute was

The reckless driving statute was

s

22

Manslaughter is contained in Title 97 cf the

2

Mississippi Code dealing with criminal offenses.

3

Reckless driving is in Title 63", dealing with traffic

4

offenses.

5

of up tc 20 years maximum in the state penitentiary.

6

Reckless driving has its own separate offense or

7

punishment cf ten days in the county jail or a fine cf

8

£50C or both.

9

Manslaughter carries its own separate penalty

Both provisions are unambiguous.

There is no

10

legislative history behind either one of these things,

11

so consequently following the presumption that this

12

Court discussed in Albernaz, we should presume that the

13

legislature of the state of Mississippi, which as

14

pointed out by this Court about the Congress is

15

primarily a lawyers’ body.

16

presumed that the legislature was familiar with this

17

Court's doctrine in Elcckburger versus the United States

18

and that they construed reckless driving to be a

19

separate offense for which separate punishment could be

20

imposed other than in the manslaugher situation.

MR. BARKSDALE;

It would have to be

16

instituted, I assume, by the complaining witness, and

Mr. Boyd can possibly fill in the gaps here, but the

18

complaining witness at Page 71 states that — this is

19

the same Justice judge, by the way, that tried and

20

convicted Mr. Roberts on the four offenses — that the

21

father made affidavit that "Mr. Roberts did unlawfully

22

and feloniously commit manslaughter," and then there is

23

a notation, "A preliminary hearing was held in my court

for Barry Joe Roberts on this charge cf manslaughter."

prove manslaughter finds it necessary to prove failure

that.

To them

But I don't know what is meant

A couple of ether procedural points that

21

perhaps would assist the Court.

There is a close

The county attorney was at the arraignment.

24

the county attorney is charged under the statute with

bringing matters before the grand jury.

1

Ycur Honor, cf course, that is

2

what seme cf the cases have addressed, where the Court

3

has said you cannot try the lesser included offense and

4

then try the greater unless at the original onset ycu

5

couldn *t have tried the lesser included.

6

to me that again that's a balancing factor under the

7

Constitution where if the state didn't have a pretty

8

good reason to know that there was going to be a death,

9

they could have gone ahead.

It would seem

But I think realistically speaking, every time

10

there is an injury in an accident, the state ought to
12

see that as a red flag, as a buzzer to wait and decide

3

whether or not they are going to indicte him.

no need to rush to judgment on this.

18

their case to use it again and to simply say to the jury

19

if you find A, B, C, D, and E plus F, then you can

20

convict him a second time.

21

can't the state wait and do it all at one time?

QUESTION;

Why is that necessary?

Well, it is not a question

necessarily of what is necessary, but what the

state to operate within those constitutional
restraints.
QUESTIONi

In the cases where the key to it is

whether additional evidence cr different evidence irust
be used, what do you think the Court was driving at?
When you say it is -- there is just one more element
that needs to be proved, that is, death.
MR. BARKSDALE;

Ycur Honor, under the

Blcckburger test, which talks cf, if two offenses can be
proved out of the same transaction, you look, does each
offense require proof cf a fact that the ether dees not,
I think that is simply the court without the evidence
before it on an interlocutory appeal or before trial is
ever held saying, now, this is our best way to try to
make sure there is no double jeopardy.

13

possibly the fact that there were two different

it appears that the same attorney, the county attorney,

QUESTION;

I don't see any distinction or

Well, tut why should the

Court -QUESTION;

6

Well, as I understood the responses

to the questions earlier by Hr. Eoyd, I thought that a

district attorney was involved in the Circuit Court

10

MR. BARKSDALE;

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. BARKSDALE;

A district attorney —

Maybe I misunderstood.
A district attorney is

13

involved, but the county attorney is also involved.

14

is responsible for trying cases in his county, so you

15

have both the district attorney and the county attorney

16

involved in the manslaughter Circuit Court case, but you

17

have the county attorney involved in Justice Court, you

18

have the county attorney involved in the arraignment,

19

you have the county attorney involved in the grand jury

20

proceedings and at the trial in Circuit Court.
QUESTION;

21

Who decides whether to present this

22

case to the grand jury?

isn't it?

I don’t see a distinction,
