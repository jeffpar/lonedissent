ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. LEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental

12

Shelf occurs in four distinct stages.

13

is the preparation by the Secretary of Interior of a five-

14

year leasing plan.

15

exploration, and finally production and development.

16

The statutes also provide for step-by-step

The first stage

It is followed by the lease sale,

17

decision making throughout these four stages in a process

18

which has two major aspects.

19

each decision is made at a time when an optimum amount

20

of information needed to support that particular decision

21

is available.

22

The first aspect is that

The second aspect is that the decision to proceed

23

through any given stage of the total OCS process does not imply

24

a commitment to any later stage.

25

The question in this case is one of statutory

interpretation.

2

ment of Section 307(c)(1) of the Coastal Zone Management Act

3

that federal activities directly affecting a state's coastal

4

zone be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the

5

maximum extent practicable with approved state coastal

6

zone management programs applies at the lease sale stage,

7

the second of the four stages, in all instances.

It is whether the substantive require­

The most helpful guide to what the statute means
is what the statute says.
What brings the CZMA's substantive requirements

11

into play is not a functional relationship or a link in

12

a chain of events, it is rather a direct effect.

13

Out of the several accepted meanings, dictionary

14

meanings, meanings approved by decisions of this Court

15

of that word "direct," not one of them, not one, supports

16

the Respondents' position in this case.

17

the Respondents have not even suggested any.

18

And, indeed,

There are several meanings of the word that

19

are directly helpful to the issue before this Court.

20

Among other things, it is language of proximity, of

21

certainty, of immanence, language that says there will

22

be no intervening agency or event.

23

Just last term in Bowsher versus Merck this

24

Court, in construing the word "direct" in another context

25

said, and I am quoting, "That whether the reference that

ment of some close connection between the thing directly

affected and the directly affecting entity.

7

obviously ..."

"It is plain from the face of

There is the require­

In any event, whether the reference is to this

8

Court's ruling in Bowsher or whether it is to any ordinary

9

dictionary definition, it is very clear that the words

10

"directly affecting" are the complete antithesis of the

11

remote and speculative circumstances that obtain at the

12

lease sale stage of Outer Continental Shelf phase develop­

13

ment.

14

whether there will be any hydrocarbons found at all;

15

whether if they are found, they will be oil or gas and

16

how and where they will be brought ashore.

At that stage, it is uncertain, for example,

17

There may be effects on the coastal zone from

18

what happens on the Outer Continental Shelf, but in this

19

case and almost all cases those are effects from what may

20

or may not happen years after the lease sale at the time

21

of exploration or production and development.

22

QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Solicitor General,

23

this has to be in the context of a coastal zone plan,

24

does it?

25

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

There are?
Yes.

And, they simply set up — They

Some of them can be very general and in our view

most of them are extremely general.
QUESTION:
MR. LEE:

Some of them —

Not-very detailed then?
They can have a certain amount of

detail, but in general they are quite general and that
gives the state additional leadway.
QUESTION:
MR. LEE:

Can you suggest what they cover?
Well, such things as the protection

of the environment and the protection of animal life and
so forth along the coastal zone which is from the shore
and three miles out to the territorial sea.
QUESTION:

But, none of the four stages comes

into play until there is such an agreement arrived at?

MR. LEE:

Yes.
It is a plan that is adopted

by the state, submitted to the Secretary of Commerce

and them approved by —
11

QUESTION:

Secretary of Commerce?

12

MR. LEE:

— the Secretary of Commerce, that

13

is correct.
14

In 1976 and 1978, Congress amended respectively
15

the CZMA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.
16

Though the hearings for the amendments to the two statutes
17

were held in tandem and certainly the two have to be
18

considered in tandem, and it was in those amendments
19

that specific provision was made for phased decision

20

making.
21

The OSC leasing process is one which, by its
22

(

very nature, lends itself to decision making by stages.

23

The total process takes years, and in some instances,
24

even decades, but there are identifiable points along
25

the line at which decisions have to be made whether

7

to proceed further.

2

Now, as an integral part of this compre­

3

hensive change to phased decision making, Congress provided

4

in Sections 11 and 25 of the OCSLA, added in 1978, and

5

in Section 307(c)(3)(B) of the C2MA which is the only section

6

that deals expressly with Outer Continental Shelf

7

transactions.

8

with their substantive capacity to halt further develop­

11

At the lease sale stage, the provision is dif­

12

ferent.

13

the OCSLA which provides for state input of information

14

regarding the size, timing, and location, which, analogous

15

to NEPA the Secretary of Interior must take into account

16

and must give reasons for his rejection of the state's

17

suggestion.

18
19

20
21

That is expressly dealt with by Section 19 of

QUESTION:

At the lease stage, is anything con­

templated except survey?
MR. LEE:

At the lease sale stage, it is surveying,

that is correct.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. LEE:

That is all?
That is correct.

Now, there can be

24

some drilling in connection with that, but no one is

25

contending that that has any environmental — Well, just

because of the drilling itself.
QUESTION:

My next question was are there any

effects at that stage from surveying?
MR. LEE:

There could be.

In some isolated

5

instances, you could have — It is basically a sonar,

6

seismic type soundings and you could have, in some

7

instances, a circumstance where the mere carrying on of

8

those surveys and those sound waves going out could have

9

some effect on animals in the area.

But, this is not

10

that kind of case and will not be in the great majority

11

of instances.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask

13

a question about the phased decision making?

14

stand it, the approval requirements for exploration,

15

development, or production are found in 307(c)(3)(B),

16

is that right, which was enacted in 1978, was it?

17

MR. LEE:

18

QUESTION:

As I under­

'76.
'76.

Now, during — I take it the

19

critical language we are focusing on was enacted some

20

years earlier?

21

MR. LEE:

22

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Now, during the period between the

23

enactment of 307(c)(1) and the later enactment of the

24

phased decision making, during the five or six years when

25

there was no phased decision making, would you say

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

directly affecting meant the same thing?
MR. LEE:

Yes, I would.

I certainly would.

3

That is definitely our position.

4

those instances, the kind of thing that I was referring

5

to in my response to Justice Brennan whether, in fact,

6

it would be direct affect.

7

QUESTION:

What it refers to are

So, you would say the directly

8

affecting requirement for your position doesn't depend

9

at all on the successive phased decision making then?

10

MR. LEE:

Well, except that it bears on — The

11

decision making reflects the fact that Congress knew at

12

the time it adopted it that that provision for a con­

13

sistency determination was not already contained in the

14

earlier language adopted in 307(c)(1).

15
16

QUESTION:

But, the language adopted in the

later stages applies to what the lessee must do?

17

MR. LEE:

18

QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is correct.

Is there any provision directing

19

the government, the federal government, in its activity

20

to comply with this consistency requirement?

21

MR. LEE:

The answer is yes, and it is

22

307(c)(1), but it rarely applies.

23

those instances in which there is, in fact, a direct

24

effect; that is an effect that does not depend on any

25

intervening agency coming into play.

It applies only in

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Now, that becomes very apparent when you look

2

at what, in fact —

3

QUESTION:

I still don't understand.

What

4

language makes the government do anything in this regard,

5

the federal government?

6

MR. LEE:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LEE:

9

Where is 307(c)(1) in the petition?
In the petition for certiorari it

is at page 84a, about the middle of the page.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LEE:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LEE:

14

It is 307(c)(1).

QUESTION:

Thank you.
In 1976 and 19 —
Excuse me, may I ask one more question?
Yes.
Under your reading of these Acts,

15

would the state lose anything by waiting until the

16

exploration stage for consistency —

17

MR. LEE:

Absolutely nothing in our view. That

18

is correct.

19

has at that exploration stage is the authority to stop.

20

Up until that point, he must take into account the views,

21

and if there is a direct effect, he stops it then.

22

is the other essential feature of OSC phased development.

23

At the exploration stage, notwithstanding the fact that

24
25

Because the other thing that the Secretary

That

the oil companies have vast amounts of money involved,
he can nevertheless say or nevertheless, if at that stage,

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the state determines that it is inconsistent, that, in

2

and of itself, stops the development.

3

it all by itself.

4

The state can do

Now, there is authority in the Secretary of

5

Commerce to override in the event that he makes an over­

6

riding decision.

7

8

But, in our view, no, the state does not lose
by waiting until the later stage.

9

What happened in '76 and '78 was that in the

10

initial phases of the congressional consideration, the

11

position that prevailed in both Houses was one which

12

was identical to the positions favored by the Respondents

13

here; that is that the consistency determination, the

14

consistency certification, would have to be made at the

15

lease sale stage.

16

to that effect that were introduced and, during the initial

17

stages, they were the ones that prevailed.

18

In both Houses there were proposals

However, they were never enacted into law.

19

There was — The word "lease" was included in this

20

307(c)(3)(B).

21

QUESTION:

May I ask just this though?

If

22

that had not been enacted, as you read 307(c)(1), the

23

government nevertheless would have been under an

24

obligation at that time to make the determination, would

25

it not?

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

MR. LEE:

Well, if there had never been the

2

subsequent — the result still would have been the same.
3

QUESTION:

So, you really didn't need the

4

subsequent history?
5

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

My reliance on what

6

happened in '76 and '78 simply — strengthens our view
7

as to (c)(1).
8

During the course of the legislative debates,
9

the Executive Branch expressed its concerned that at the
10

lease sale stage we simply don't know enough.

And, if

11

you will look at page 30 of our brief, you will see that
12

Congress shared that view.

They shared that concern that

13

the leases were being stopped at the lease sale stage
14

and as a consequence they opted for the phased
15

development.
16

The net result was that the original language,
17

which included leases within its consistency certifications
18

requirements, was dropped and in its place or instead
19

rather Section 307(c)(3)(B) was added.

It was a new

20

section.

It is the only part of the entire statute that

21

deals with OCS transactions.
22

And, as a net result, the provisions of the
23

CZMA which deal with CZMA applicability to OCS trans­
24

actions are identical to the provisions of the OCSLA
25

dealing with CZMA applicability to OCS transations;

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

namely, that CZMA's substantive requirements apply only

2

at the exploration and production and development stages

3

and that is what expressly Section 307(c)(3)(B) says in

4

the CZMA and that is what Sections 11, 19, and 25 of the

5

OCSLA says.

6

necessarily related statutes out of sync with each other.

7

And, any other view puts these two

At the lease sale stage what happens is it is

8

a procedural requirement of coordination, involvement,

9

cooperation that the Secretary is required to consider,

10

but there is not substantive authority to stop the

11

project.

12

Now, the Respondent's contention is that a CZMA

13

obligation at the lease sale stage is imposed on the

14

federal government by the directly affecting language

15

and this gets to Justice Steven's question.

16

There are at least two flaws in that argument.

17

The first one is that it flies in the face of what the

18

statute says for reasons already discussed, means

19

direct.

20

not come about depending on events which have not yet

21

occurred.

22

sale circumstance and it fits no definition of the word

23

"direct."

24
25

It simply cannot mean something that may or may

That is an undisputed description of the lease

Second, if Congress — If the reason that Con­
gress eliminated the blanket requirement of consistency

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

determinations at the lease sale stage from the only part

2

of the statute that expressly deals with OCS transactions

3

after months of consideration of the issue was because

4

of some discovery that it was already contained in another

5

part of the Act that was already in existence, Congress

6

surely would have said so.

7

If Section 307(c)(1), which is the directly

8

affecting section, already contained a CZMA lease sale

9

requirement, why did Congress give such extensive con­

10

sideration to whether that self same requirement should

11

be written in the OCS subsection?

12

There is not one word in the legislative history

13

that so much as hints that the reason that leasing was

14

not included, indeed, was deleted from Section 307(c)(B)

15

was redundancy.

16

incompatibility with the phased development of the OCS

17

that was the centerpiece.

18
19

It was rather impracticability,

For the answer to that question, I

Chief Justice Burger, and may it

please the Court:

13

I think I know the first question I must answer

and the answer to the question, Justice Brennan, is that,

15

indeed, the statute makes it quite clear that if an

the power to do, then the lessees under the statute —

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

MR. BRUCE:

Well, the regulations define it

3

hardly adding much to the language of the statute itself.
4

There is a regulatory definition within the Department
5

of Commerce as to the policy matters the Secretary of
6

Commerce may consider.

To my knowledge, no successful

7

appeal has yet been invoked, but I should add that this
8

statute still is rather new to us.

There is little

9

experience under it.
10

I would like to also amplify, Justice Stevens,
11

one of the answers that the Solicitor General gave to
12

one of your questions.

At the later stages, under

13

307(c)(3)(B), it is not simply a matter of lessee
14

compliance.

The Secretary of the Interior, under Section

15

11 and Section 25 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands
16

Act, is directed not to approve the requisite permits
17

for exploration or production and development unless
18

consistency is achieved.
19

So, he doesn't step out of the picture.

He

20

is very much into the picture.

Congress explicitly put

21

him into the picture.
22

QUESTION:

He was not in the picture in 1972,

MR. BRUCE:

Well, in 1972, that part of the

23

was he?
24
25

OCS Lands Act did not exist.

QUESTION:
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:

That is my point.
But, our position —
To look at the problem as of '72,

we would have nothing but the language, directly affected,
to deal with.
MR. BRUCE:

I would go back even further.

I

would go back to 1953 and consider what Congress did in
reaction to this Court's decisions in the so-called
tidelands oil controversy, look at that determination,
and then ask the question whether the statutory language
that they used in 1972 and the legislative history associated
with the 1972 — radically changed that.

The Plaintiffs

say that it did, but the Plaintiffs offer no definition,
as the Solicitor General has told us, of the term
"directly affecting" that begins at all to cpmport with
their position.

To the contrary, it is their position

in their briefs — California's position that the meaning
of these terms are unclear and they urge upon this Court
what they themselves characterize as a broad, liberal,
or expansive definition in order to suit their needs.
They not only ignore the language of Section
307(c)(1), they ignore the very specific arrangements
of Section 19 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act,
where in 1978 Congress addressed this very question, what
role shall we create for the states in the OCS tract

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

selection process at the leasing stage and provided an

2

arrangement quite different than the one that emerges

3

from their interpretation.

4

They ignore 307(c)(3)(B) and what it says about

5

the role of the CZMA in the OCS process and they ignore

6

Sections 11 and 25 that interlock these two.

7

Now, how do they justify this?

They do it

8

ultimately on a policy argument.

9

OCS leasing is simply so important that we simply must

10

have this authority, we must have input at the leasing

11

stage.

12

They say really that

There are three, at least three depositive answers

13

to that argument.

14

repeatedly held in recent years and in past years that

15

we start with the language with which Congress expressed

16

itself.

17

and create a different scheme.

18

In the first place, this Court has

We don't ask the judges to delve into policy

A second answer is this:

In 1978, when the

19

OCS Lands Acts was completely revised, Congress addressed

20

the very policy question upon which Plaintiffs stand

21

here; that is the need for state input into the process.

22

That was defined as a major policy goal of the Outer

23

Continental Shelf Lands Act.

24
25

When Congress did that it adopted Section 19.
Indeed, it adopted it at the urging of California,

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Massachusetts and other states who, notwithstanding the

2

existence of the 1972 CZMA said, we need a role in the

3

tract selection process and Congress gave them that role.

4

And, that role was for governors to make recommendations;

5

that role was for the Secretary of the Interior to have

6

final authority to assess a balance between state and

7

national interests subject, of course, to judicial review

8

in a well-defined means.

9

Indeed, even in 1976, when Congress was

10

addressing policy under the CZMA, in making these major

11

amendments to that Act, taking into account the need to

12

have an aggressive OCS program, it addressed the policy

13

question and it said we are giving the states a right

14

to apply their programs at these later stages, at

15

exploration and. development.

16

said that this would satisfy state needs for complete

17

information on a timely basis about the details of the

18

oil industry's plans.

And, the conference report

submit, can be found in their steady resistance to offer

2

to this Court or any court what would flow from adopting

3

their directly affecting argument.

4

would we have?

5

What consequences

In the lower court, certainly in the trial court,

6

they said they would have final authority, recognizing

7

the improbability, shall I say, of that position.

8

now retreat to some undefined degree of deference that

9

would have if (c)(1) applies as they say it applies.

The point to nothing in the CZMA, the OCS Lands

11

Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, general principles

12

of administrative law, that this Court or any court could

13

consider in deciding how much deference they were due.

14

They would create, it seems to me, litigation

15

over the years trying to make these case-by-case adjust­

16

ments as the Ninth Circuit itself recognized.

17

Now, sometimes, indeed, all too often, this

18

Court is confronted with statutory schemes where Congress

19

hasn't been specific enough and litigation must be

20

resorted to to solve these kinds of problems.

21

We submit in this case the confusion implicit

22

in the Plaintiff's position could be achieved only be

23

ignoring Congress' repeated statements time and time again

24

as to how these two statutory schemes are to work.

25

We submit that the Court should hold that the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

leasing stage, the selection of tracts itself, does not

2

directly affect the coastal zone.

3

The Court, in its opinion, should also recognize

4

that Section 19 provides a ready means for state input

5

into the process.

6

In so holding, the Court would harmonize the

7

two statutes, the CZMA and the OCSLA.

8

the basic policy position upon which the Plaintiffs stand,

9

the need for state input, and it would channel disputes

It would recognize

10

into a congressional defined administrative mechanism

11

with judicial review.

12

We submit that this is a far better way to resolve

13

the issues in this case rather than to indulge Plaintiffs

14

in their expansive and liberal approach to the legislation

15

which raises far more problems than it settles.

16

If the Court has no questions, I will sit down.

24

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORA BERGER

21

23

Very well.

MS. BERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am going to try and explain this morning why
it is important to apply state coastal zone management

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

programs which are federally approved to the Department

2

of Interior's Outer Continental Shelf leasing activities

3

and how that process can, in fact, work.

4

But, before I get to that point, I am going

5

to be addressing what Petitioners' definition of the

6

directly affecting test is.

7

And, let me just say at the outset that they

8

would like to have this Court define the phrase

9

"directly affecting the coastal zone" in Section 307(c)(3)

10

of the Coastal Zone Management Act solely be reference

11

to the purposes and policies of an entirely different

12

statute, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act amendment.

13

Now, as Justice Stevens pointed out earlier,

14

those amendments were not passed until 1978.

15

system of phased development that they are relying on

16

for their definition of the directly affecting test was

17

a subsequently enacted statute.

18

This entire

The words "directly affecting the coastal zone"

19

were enacted in 1972 and that is the statute that is before

20

the Court for construction.

21

Let me also emphasize that it is a phrase we

22

are talking about, "directly affecting the coastal zone."

23

Petitioners would like to have the Court simply define

24

the word "directly."

25

is legislative intent on that phrase in the Coastal Zone

That is not the issue here.

QUESTION:

When you say that the issue is not

4

the meaning of the words "directly affecting," but instead

5

it is the legislative intent in using those terms?

6

MS. BERGER:

It is the meaning of the phrase

7

"directly affecting the coastal zone."

8

word "directly," as Petitioners would have it.

9

It is not one

It is also important to focus on how Petitioners

10

have suggested that that phrase be defined.

11

to Petitioners, no federal activity directly affects the

12

coastal zone unless it has immediate physical impacts

13

on the coastal zone without subsequent governmental

14

approvals.

16

consistency determination for Lease Sale 53.

17

20

contradicts that test.

21

According

You can't find it in the legislation

To the contrary, all of the legislative history

It doesn't really foster the purposes of the

22

Act because this was an Act that was designed for the

23

long-term management of the coastal zone through a process

24

of federal/state coordination and cooperation.

25

that that process would not be fostered by a restrictive

1

definition such as the one put forth by Petitioners.

2

The only thing they can site for this narrow

3

definition is the dictionary.

4

the dictionary definition is only of the word "directly."

5

It doesn't give us any definition of the phrase.

Now, if you look — Again,

6

But, if you look at the dictionary definition,

7

you will not find the definition offered by Petitioners.

8

The dictionary doesn't say that you have to have physical

9

impacts.

10

The dictionary doesn't say anything about

subsequent governmental approvals.

11

The only thing — The closest thing that they

12

can find in the dictionary is the notion of intervening

13

cause.

14

even under that test Lease Sale 53 would directly affect

15

the coastal zone because this is the activity that sets

16

in motion the whole chain of events which lead to the

17

coastal zone impacts with which we are concerned.

18

is the key activity.

19

And, the trial court analyzed that test and said

This

The other important thing to understand about

20

Petitioners' definition is that it virtually exempts all

21

of the Department of Interior's significant OCS decision

22

making; that is tract selection and the imposition of

23

lease stipulations.

24
25

Now, Mr. Bruce said this morning that under
their definition tract selection is exempt.

You will

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

that also in the Joint Appendix at page 72.

2

In the letter to California refusing to do the

3

consistency determination, the Department of Interior

4

explained that under their definition tract selection

5

is not an activity that requires compliance with the

6

Coastal Zone Management Act.

7

it is only in the rarest of cases under their definition

8

that lease sales would ever come into this process of

9

coastal zone management that was anticipated by Congress.

In fact, as I must admit,

10

And, in fact, there has only been on instance in the entire

11

history of OCS leasing since 1972 that I am aware of where

12

they have ever actually applied consistency to a lease

13

sale.

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. BERGER:

Where as that?
That was an instance in Alaska,

10

Your Honor, in 1977.

17

situation where the Department of Interior imposed a

18

stipulation requiring the lessee to immediately build

19

gravel islands and the Department felt that the gravel

20

islands themselves would cause impacts on the coastal

21

zone.

22

That was a particularly unusual

Therefore, they did a consistency determination

23

on the effect of building the gravel islands, but no

24

consistency determination on the effect of the lease sale.

25

Now, One of the main arguments of the Department

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

of Interior is that you simply cannot apply the con­

2

sistency process to their OCS leasing activities.

3

would be unworkable.

4

litigation and the very important federal OCS leasing

5

program would grind to a halt.

It

You would have a morass of

6

Well, I submit that that has been disproven,

7

Your Honors, because as a result of litigation in this

8

case, the Department of Interior has been forced to

9

prepare consistency determinations all over the country

10

for a great number of states.

differences out.

that this lease sale is consistent with your coastal zone

11

determination and said, you are right, we agree with you,

12

and there is no problem with holding this lease sale just

13

as you have suggested.

14

The state looked at the consistency

In five instances, the state said, no, we think

15

there are problems for coastal zone management if you

16

go ahead exactly as you have said, but they sat down

17

together and they tried to resolve the problem in a way

18

that would allow the lease sale to proceed while still

19

taking into account these coastal zone management concerns.

20

In each of those five instances, the Depart­

21

ment of Interior reached a memorandum of understanding

22

with the state which in no way interfered with the holding

23

of the lease sale.

24

of all of these consistency determination, has litigation

Now, Petitioners will try and tell you that

this entire process, these agreements that were worked

15

out, were solely as a result of the Outer Continental

16

Shelf Lands Act amendments, that they can reach agreements

17

with the states under the OCS Lands Act.

18

of the matter is that four out of the five agreements

19

that were reached expressly relied on the coastal zone

20

management program for the state.

21

But, the fact

So, I submit to you that the process is work­

And, it is impossible to

Who decides, Ms. Berger, whether

15

or not there will be piecemeal submission or perhaps a

16

more general submission?

17

MS. BERGER:

Well, in this case, it is the

18

Department of Interior, because if consistency review

19

were applied at the lease sale stage, you could address

20

these concerns on a broader basis.

21

If they refuse to do the consistency determination,

22

then the state can only reach these concerns on a tract-

23

by-tract basis which is, of course, not a very satis­

24

Why is the state's ability limited

in the 307(c)(3) stage?
MS. BERGER:

Well, let me give you an example.

14

One of the major parts of the Department of Interior's

15

decisions at the lease sale stage is the question of

16

tract selection.

18

leasing and what areas they are going to exclude from

20

That is the determination of where in

So, suppose you had a situation where the

21

state was concerned about a coastal zone resource of

22

national significance that was recognized under its

23

coastal zone management program, and suppose also that

24

the only way to protect that particular resource was to

25

not lease and develop the immediately adjacent OCS tracts —

QUESTION:

The state does.

QUESTION:

The state can say it if it wants

to and the oil company takes the risk of being able
to comply with the coastal management plan, doesn't
it?
MS. BERGER:

Well, Your Honor, you could

look at it that way, but that is not a very practical
way to go about things.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't know.

It seems

to me awfully direct if the state says, sorry, you
are out of business.
MS. BERGER:

Well, I guess the other main

problem with it, Your Honor, is that this is an Act
that is designed for comprehensive, long-term planning
and management and it is a little 1-ate to start that
planning after the major planning decisions have been
made by the Department of the Interior.
QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Berger, as I understood

it at least, the first stage of offshore developments
and leasing would be the development of the five-year

21

schedules by the Department of Interior of the OCS
22
23
24
25

lease sales and during that interval of time, the Secretary
of Interior, as I understand it, is required to solicit
comments from both interested federal agencies as well
as the governors of each state and has to respond in

36
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIR8T ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

writing to all those state governors' comments.

2

that is the first stage when the state can participate,

3

right?

4

MS. BERGER:

5

QUESTION:

6

Yes, Your Honor.
Before you even get to this section

we are dealing with.

7

MS. BERGER:

8

QUESTION:

9

So,

Yes.
Then, in addition, I thought the

second stage, where the state had an opportunity, was

10

in meeting the requirements of NEPA and the Endangered

11

Species Act where the governor of every state affected

12

is given a formal opportunity to submit recommendations

13

on the size and the timing and the locations of the

14

proposed leases.

15

have we not, for states as a whole to impact on the

16

tract selection in effect?

17

So, we have already had two opportunities,

MS. BERGER:

Your Honor, but the answer to

18

that is that Congress intended a different opportunity

19

for the states under the Coastal Zone Management Act.

20

And, you can find that expressly stated in the legislative

21

history of the OCS Lands Act.

22

of Section 1345 of the Act — This was in Section 19

23

of the amendments — that is the very section of the

24

OCS Lands Act that talks about OCS leasing and that

25

legislative history expressly states that the Department

2

with coastal zone management programs.

Now, Petitioners always skip over that piece

of legislative history, but we submit that it is extremely

5

telling.

MS. BERGER:

QUESTION:

9

MS. BERGER:

10

11

That is in '78?
That is in '78.
That is the House report?

QUESTION:

Yes, the final House report.
Is there anything in the Senate

about it?

12

MS. BERGER:

No.

And, the Act followed the

13

House report so that is the one that was entitled to

14

weight.

15

Perhaps I can give you another example other

16

than tract leasing and that is the imposition of lease

17

stipulations at the lease sale stage.

18

This is a very important example, because

19

frequently these agreements, recent agreements with

20

the statess that have been worked out illustrate. Frequently

21

leasing can be squared with coastal zone management

22

programs simply by the imposition of stipulations.

23

You don't need tract deletion at all and that is a

24

very important reason to start this process at the

25

lease sale stage rather than waiting for later when

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

MS. BERGER:

QUESTION:

MS. BERGER:

By stipulate where, Ms. Berger?
Pardon me?
By stipulation where?
A lease stipulation is a term

6

of a contract between the Department of Interior and

7

the lessee oil company.

8

point because when they issue the lease, all of the

9

stipulations that the Department of Interior has deter­

10

mined will be part of this lease sale are then included

11

in each of the contracts with the oil companies.

12

the companies know from the very outset what the rules

13

of the game are going to be.

14

reason the coastal zone management program must be

15

brought to bear at that point.

16

And, that is an important

So,

That is another important

Let me give you an example.

The California

17

Coastal Zone Management Program contains a policy which

18

requires the consolidation of onshore support facilities

19

for offshore oil and gas development.

20

Now, that is a sensible policy because otherwise

21

you would have a proliferation of these support facilities

22

all along the coast and it is in keeping with a requirement

23

of the Coastal Zone Management Act that you have orderly

24

siting of onshore support facilities for offshore oil

25

development.

That is true, Your Honor, but—
So, why would you be talking about

a consolidated facility at that stage?

7

MS. BERGER:

Well, let me respond.

First

8

of all, they do have a fairly good idea of what is

9

out there because they have resource estimates that

10

the Department of Interior itself relied on to determine

11

whether the bids are adequate.

12

they have even more specific information on expected

13

resources based upon development of adjacent tracts.

In fact, often times

But, more importantly, this is the time when

they decide whether the tracts will be developed or

not.

oil in a given tract, but if you do find oil, the lease

has decided that development is going to go forward

on that tract.

In other words, it is possible you may not find

QUESTION:

But, under 307(c)(3), the state

can object after that stage if it is inconsistent with

MS. BERGER:

The state can object, but as

we said, Your Honor, that is a little late to do the

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. BERGER:

10

Section 307(c)(1) is

For things that directly affect?
That is correct.

Perhaps a better answer to Your Honor1s question

11

is the legislative history.

12

in the legislative history of both statutes, the CZMA

13

and the OCS Lands Act, that these decisions of the

14

Department of Interior must comply with consistency

15

requirements and that they wanted a broad definition

16

of the directly affecting test, not a narrow definition.

17

QUESTION:

Congress has said repeatedly

Ms. Berger, is it true that the

18

original bills involved when this directly affected

19

language was added to CZMA, under both the original

20

House and Senate bills, it was reasonably clear, was

21

it not, that the lease sale stage would not have required

22

the CZMA consistency submission?

24

an interesting question, because under the original

25

bills, the language in both versions was in the coastal

MS. BERGER:

4

Right.
And they changed it to directly

affecting.

5

QUESTION:

It was only this last-minute amend­

6

ment that imposed the requirement that we are now dealing

7

with.

8
9

MS. BERGER:

However, there is some language

in the reports that we have cited indicating — and

10

perhaps this is the only explanation of the legislative

11

history that tells you why Congress did change to the

12

directly affecting test.

13

There are statements in the legislative history

14

going back to 1971 that Congress always intended that

15

federal activities, even if the were outside the coastal

16

zone, would have to comply with consistency requirements

17

if they had a functional interrelationship with coastal

18

zone management.

19

And, the example that was given in the

20

legislative reports was a situation between the channel

21

islands offshore California and the mainland.

22

is the OCS.

23

legislative history plainly states that that was supposed

24

to be covered by consistency review.

25

That is an area of the OCS.

This

And, the

So, I submit to the Court that is the only

explanation we have of why Congress changed to this

at those kinds of activities.

time it made a number of statements to the effect that

24

25

were always covered by the Act as it existeds in 1972

In 1976, Congress

But, the fact of the matter is the

It had nothing to do with the pre­

Those can only be addressed under Section

In 1978, Congress amended the OCS Lands Act

and established this phased development that the

Petitioners rely on, but, again, the legislative history

there specifically — On lease sales, they said lease

They included a savings clause saying that nothing

18

in the 1978 amendments was intended to modify in any

19

way the requirements of the 1972 Coastal Zone Management

20

Act.

21

must comply with coastal zone management programs.

In 1980, Congress again amended the Coastal

22

Zone Management Act and made a number of statements

23

of great import in this case indicating that they always

24

intended Interior's pre-leasing activities to be covered

25

and that they wanted a broad test of directly affecting.

QUESTION:

Who made these statements?

MS. BERGER:

These statements, Your Honor,

are in the committee reports.

And, I recognize that

the Solicitor argues that we shouldn't pay any
attention to those statements, but the fact of the
matter is the very statements that we rely on Congress
specifically linked to a change that was made in 1980,
and that is the fact that they amended a section, a
policy section of the Act in 1980 requiring the federal
government to cooperate with the states on coastal
zone management issues.
QUESTION:

Did they amend this section contain­

ing the words "directly affecting?"
MS. BERGER:

No, Your Honor, they did not.

What they did do, however, — These reports were generated
as a result of the year of oversight activity and in
that activity Congress was now dealing for the first
time with the implementation of these state programs.
QUESTION:

But, they are all post-enactment

statements, aren't they?
MS. BERGER:

They are post — Well, not insofar

as they discuss this change that was made in 1980.
QUESTION:

No, but as to directly affecting.

MS. BERGER:

Well, they said that the broad

definition of directly affecting was consistent with

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the change that they made in 1980.
QUESTION:

2
3

We don't usually give too much

weight to post-enactment statements, do we?

4

MS. BERGER:

Well, Your Honor, this Court

5

certainly has given weight to post-enactment statements

6

where they are as relevant as these statements are.

7

Not only that, Congress did not simply come up with

8

a new test in 1980.

9

interrelationship test, which I mentioned going back

They said that the functional

10

to 1972, was always the test.

11

Congress is saying at a later date we have now discovered

12

the test.

13

was always the test.

14

and it still is the test.

15

It is not as though

Instead, what they are doing is saying this
We told you that many years ago

But, another important point is that no coastal

18

zone management programs were approved until 1977.

17

So, the 1980 legislative history is the first time

18

that Congress was actually focusing on how the process

19

worked and this is their explanation of how Section

20

307(c)(1) works and why they didn't amend the Act in

21

1980.

22

I might point out that the oil industry was

23

lobbying heavily at that point asking that the con­

24

sistency requirements be changed.

25

explanation of why they were not going to change Section.

And, this was Congress'

And the '78 amendments to the

3

OCS Act, that legislative history is not post anything.

It is in connection with those amendments.

5

understand the committee to have said that nothing

6

in these amendments should indicate that you should

rely on the Act, on those amendments or on the OCS

8

Act for any inference that lease sales weren't covered.

Because of the difference between

two or three of these appeals for the Secretary of

22

Commerce to override thus far, but the fact of the

23

matter is that none of those have been successful.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORA BERGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS — Surrebuttal

10

MS. BERGER:

I certainly do, Your Honor,

and J thank you for giving me that opportunity.

11

I think that the table of contents of one

12

document offered by Petitioners at the last moment

13

is hardly very probative, but if the Court wishes to

14

supplement the record in this fashion, I would like

15

to be able to submit documents that would disprove

16

Petitioners' statements if that —

17

QUESTION:

Do you have any documents that

18

bear on this and tend to develop what you have just

19

suggested?

MS. BERGER:

I think, Your Honors, the better

course of action would be to keep the record as we

3

have it and just allow me to answer the point that

4

was raised about cumulative impacts.

5

The fact of the matter is, as many of the

6

questions have pointed out this morning, those impacts

are best addressed at the lease sale stage.

8

are going to put the state in the position where they

9

can only be addressed under Section 307(c)(3), then

If you

10

the state has no choice but to simply say we can't

11

allow this to go forward, we can't have this tract

12

developed because we didn't care of this earlier on.

13

If you took care of it at the lease sale

14

stage, as I pointed out earlier, you could impose stipu­

15

lations that would allow the leasing to proceed, that

16

it is really too late to take care of these problems

17

at the exploration and development stage.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted.
