ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD R. DAILEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

5

MR. DAILEY;

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
This is an appeal from a decision of the

8
9

Hr. Dailey, I think you

Suprem e Court of Appeals of West Virginia.

It brings

10

into q uestion the validity under the Constitution of a

11

gross receipts tax imposed by the State of West Virginia

12

upon t he appellant Armcc as a result of Armcc's sale of

13

proper ty to customers in West Virginia.

14

The issues presented are two.

The first is

15

whe the r there was a sufficient nexus between the

16

transa ctions involved here and the State of West

17

V i r gi n ia; and the second is whether the tax involved

18

here i s invalid because it discriminates against

19

in ters tate commerce.
Armco is an Ohio corporation which for many

20
21

years has been qualified to do business in West

22

Virgin ia.

23

aud it periods involved here, its connection with the

24

State of West Virginia was of three sorts.

9

manufactured by Armcc outside the state.

10

What is at issue here are sales of three products
Those products

are metal buildings, steel and wire rope.

11

These sales have many characteristics in

12

common .

13

outside of West Virginia, there was no sales office

14

involved in West Virginia, no resident salesman in West

15

Virginia, no inventory in West Virginia? orders were

16

accepted outside West Virginia, and the goods were

17

delivered to common carriers outside West Virginia.

18

Not only were the materials manufactured

The products themselves were marked in West

Virginia in two different ways.

20

were sold to two franchised dealers within West

21

Virginia.

23

name, and Armco agreed to share advertising expenses.

selling of tangible property at wholesale.
The lower court in West Virginia held that the

12

transactions involved here did not have a sufficient

13

nexus tc permit taxation under the Due Irocess Clause

14

and the Commerce Clause.

15

Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia reversed.

16

The court of appeals or the

My remarks today will address three points.

17

The first point is the conclusion of the court below

18

that the unitary business theory should be applied tc

19

find the appropriate nexus here.

20

The second point is the assertion that even if

21

the unitary business theory is not applicable here,

22

there was a sufficient nexus between these transactions

23

and the taxing jurisdiction.

24
25

And the third is Armco's claim that this tax
is unconstitutional because it discriminates against
5

1

interstate commerce.

2

QUESTION;

Hr. Dailey, it would be helpful to

3

me if sometime in your argument you could describe with

4

perhaps some particularity exactly what transactions of

5

Armco West Virginia seeks to tax here.

6

it, they're not trying to level a gross receipts tax or

7

a privilege tax on all the income from Armco wherever

8

received.

9

which

10

They're trying to levy a tax on transactions

they claim, and you deny, have some nexus with

West Virginia.

11

HE. DAILEY;

12

QUESTION:

13

As I understand

That's correct, Your Honor.
Just sales to West Virginia

customers, right?

14

HR. DAILEY:

That's correct.

15

If the tax is imposed on the gross receipts

16

from sales of wire rope, steel and metal buildings only

17

to customers in West Virginia.

18

This Court has stated that a state tax on

19

income must be applied through an activity with a

20

substantial nexus with the taxing jurisdiction.

21

court below concluded, on the ether hand,

22

not need to examine the connection between these

23

transactions and the State of West Virginia.

24
25

The

that it did

It reached that result because it applied a
unitary business theory.

It said that Armco was a
6

1

unitary business operating under a single corporate

2

umbrella, and that since its activities in the area cf

3

coal mining were substantial in West Virginia, that

4

justified them in taxing the gross receipts frcm these

5

sales

6

between the sales and the State of West Virginia.

without inquiry as to whether there was any nexus

This is a rather dramatic departure from prior

7
8

decisions of this Court and, we submit, is wholly

9

inappr cpriate.
The unitary business theory arose in response

10
11

to a peculiar problem posed by net income taxes.

The

12

problem is that it is difficult to figure out how much

13

of a corporation's net income might properly be said to

14

be attributable to any given taxing jurisdiction.

15

Accordingly, under the theory, with which this Court has

16

some familiarity, the total net income of a taxpayer

17

unitary business is peculiar, and then that income is

18

apportioned among the various taxing states on the basis

19

of formulas.
The problem cf not being able to compute the

20
21

proper

amount of income attributable to any state and

22

thus the occasion for the unitary business theory simply

23

is not

24

knew to a penny Armcc's gross receipts from West

25

Virginia sales, and there is simply no occasion for the

present in the case of a gross receipts tax.

7

We

1
2

theory
More important, the application here of the

3

unitary business theory would evidently remove all

4

constitutional restraints on the ability of West

5

Virginia to tax Armco sales.

6

Suppose, for example, that West Virginia

7

asserted the right to tax property manufactured by Armco

8

in Chic and sold to customers in Indiana?

9

we would all agree that West Virginia can't do that.

Now, I think

10

And I suspect the reason why we think West Virginia

11

can’t do that is that such a transaction has absolutely

12

no connection to the State of West Virginia.

13

the connection with the State of West Virginia what the

14

court below said it didn't have to lock at.

15

Put that

So on the whole, we suggest that the

16

traditional nexus rules which require a substantial

17

nexus to the activity being taxed has served us well.

18

QUESTION4

Yet the Supreme Court of Appeals

19

didn't say that there need be, in this case, no nexus,

20

because it only allowed the taxation of transactions —

21

of sales to people in West Virginia.

22

MR. DAILEY*

That’s correct, Your Honor.

And,

23

of course, there is also a state law problem.

24

25

business of selling at wholesale in West Virginia.
8

You must

So

1

that my example of the sale from Chic tc Indiana is a

2

purely constitutional example, not — net -- we would

3

still have to find the business in West Virginia as a

4

matter cf state law.
QUESTION:

5

But don’t you think that perhaps

6

analysis under apportioned income tax may be somewhat

7

different than analysis under a privilege tax such as

8

this,

cr do you think they’re the same?
MR. DAILEY:

9

Ch, I think the analysis of the

10

income arising in a jurisdiction is -- is the amount of

11

income that’s being taxed is quite different in a gross

12

receipts tax case and a net income tax case.
As I say, in a net income tax case, it is an

13
14

accounting impossibility to allocate properly the net

15

incomes of the various taxing jurisdictions, and thus

16

the birth of the unitary business theory.

17

problem is presented in the case cf gross receipts.
QUESTION:

18

No such

If Armco had organized a West

19

Virginia corporation that owned and operated the mine,

would

22

there be any basis for any analysis of the unitary

MR. DAILEY:

I think the question with regard

23

to the sales that are at issue here, Your Honor, would

24

be precisely the same.

I think so.

Logically they would.

Oh, I suspect they would.

do here.

KB. DAILEY:

of the unitary business theory is improper, we turn to

the question of what else might constitute a sufficient

Standard Pressed Steel involved a Washington

Washington.

4

5

employee of the seller to solicit orders from Boeing, a

6

single customer.

Those sales were solicited by a resident of

The Standard Pressed Steel case involved a

7

8

continuous presence in the State of Washington, a

9

presence which the Court found contributed directly to

10

the sales in question.
We think the same thing was true in the

11

12

General Motors case; that there was a continuous and

13

important presence within the state that contributed to

14

the production of the sales in question.
Here there is no continuous presence at all in

15
16

the state.

17

Virginia so far as these sales go is really flimsy.

18

There’s not a great deal to it.

19

those two cases support our view and carry out the

20

intent of the earlier decision of this Court in the

21

Norton case --

Armco's connection with the State of West

QUESTION:

23

your favor, isn’t it?

24

MR. DAILEY:

25

QUESTION:

And it seems to me that

Well, that’s the closest case in

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe it is.

Because there there was presence
11

1

for other purposes but not presence for these particular

2

-- for the particular sales involved.

3

MS. DAILEY:

Precisely.

Precisely.

And this

4

Court held that you could net, in effect, borrow the

5

nexus from the activities that were clearly being

6

carried on within the state and attribute that nexus to

7

the sales in question.
QUESTION;

Norton was?

What do you think the theory of

Wasn't it — it reads to me as though it

were a commerce theory rather than a due process theory.

11

MR. DAILEY:

12

QUESTION;

13

ME. DAILEY:

It's difficult -Or a nexus theory.
It -- well, it clearly is a nexus

14

theory.

As to whether it should be thought of as a due

15

process case or a Commerce Clause case, it is difficult

16

to tell.
QUESTION:

17

Well, if it were a Commerce Clause

18

case,

19

rather read it as a due process case.

you're kind of in trouble, aren't you?

MR. DAILEY;

We are content with reading it

either way.

You would

Are you?
Yes.

Yes, we think it supports

us no matter which provision we're under.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dailey, what economic
12

1

difference do you think there really is between a local

2

sales tax borne by local buyers and a business income

3

tax calculated on the basis of sales made to buyers in

the taxing state, which is the distinction Norton tried

5

to draw.

MR. DAILEY:

Do you think there’s an economic

dif fer ence?
MR. DAILEY;

9
10

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

We do think

there’s an

11

QUESTION’:

Well, what is it --

12

MR. DAILEY;

13

In order to conclude that, let us say, a use

— Economic difference.

14

tax imposed on a local purchaser is — is comparable to

15

a gross receipts tax imposed on the seller, you have to

16

make a couple of assumptions.

17

of — it’s a matter of indifference to a state

18

legislature whether they enact a use tax on the local

19

buyer or a gross receipts tax on the foreign seller.

20

don’t believe that assumption is warranted.

21

that legislatures find a use tax to be a very

22

politically responsive tax imposed on local residents.

23

One is that it was sort

about either a sales tax or a business income tax.
MR. DAILEY;

Yes.

And in order -- it did,
13

1

you’re correct.

2

you must also assume that in the case of a gross

3

receipts tax imposed on a seller, to make them

4

comparable you must assume that the seller is able tc

5

pass on the burden of that tax.

And in order to find those comparable,

7

HR. DAILEY;

8

that,

9
10

Well,

we knew that he is, don’t we?

I don’t know that we do know

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Well, as a matter of pure

economics, how could it be otherwise?

11

HR. DAILEY;

Well, it could be otherwise if

12

the market — the sales price is a price negotiated in

13

some sort of bargaining, and the extent to which a

14

seller is able to pass on a gross receipts tax and place

15

the burden of it on his buyer seems to me to be a factor

16

of a variety of economic considerations.
QUESTION;

17

Well, most courts have just

18

recognized the ability to pass it on as a matter of

something you can take judicial notice of.

So Armco has an advantage there,

MR. DAILEY;

5

KB. DAILEY:

6
7

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to return for a moment to Armco’s

8

claim that the West Virginia tax on wholesale sales is

9

unconstitutional because it discriminates against

10
11

12

interstate commerce.
The starting point here is the statute itself
• which imposes the wholesale tax on manufacturers

13

operating outside West Virginia, but exempts local

14

manufacturers from paying the tax.

15

discrimination seems clear.

16

So far, the

Now, the saving grace is said to be the local

The manufacturing tax does not compensate for

23

the tax on wholesale sales in the same manner, for

24

example, that a use tax compensates for a sales tax.

17

that only in the case cf taxes which complement or

in-state activities —

Were there differences for the

taxpayers in those cases?

10

MR. DIGGES:

11

QUESTION;

Excuse roe/ Your Honor?
Were there differences, different

12

tax rates for the domestic corporations in those other

13

cases?
MR. DIGGES:

14

I'm not sure about the rates or

15

the taxes involved.

The tax was levied on engaging

16

within the business or within the state in the business

17

of selling in both -- in both instances.
I would like to review Armco's in-state

18
19

activity for a moment.

Armco's, as discussed, business

20

activities are divided into — on a divisional basis

21

with each division making products and selling only the

22

products made by that division.
Armco's Steel Division employed four salesmen

23
24

within

West Virginia, two each from its Pittsburgh and

25

Cincinnati offices.

Such salesmen systematically and
19

1

repetitively covered the State of West Virginia

2

soliciting business.

3

on an average of once every four to six weeks with one

4

salesman making as much as two monthly visits.

duration of the salesmen's in-state solicitation

activities is not in the record.

weeks.

It's just simply net stated.
The in-state activities of the Steel Division

were described by Armcc’s witness, Hr. Geary, the

Cincinnati district's sales — the Cincinnati district

sales manager.

13

clear up a misunderstanding which has resulted from Hr.

14

Geary’s testimony.

15

I’d like to take this opportunity tc

Hr. Geary stated that in 1976, 77 percent cf

16

the sales to West Virginia customers from his office,

17

the Cincinnati district of the Steel Division, were

18

solicited outside of West Virginia.

19

that even those sales did have some in-state aspects

20

such as coming in into the state to investigate

21

been independently taxed.

But to review again on the 77 percent basis,

3

that 77 percent figure which has been presented to this

Court is inaccurate; that it only applied to the sales

of the Cincinnati office, and it only applied to the

that estimation isn’t relevant to this case.

And since 1976 was outside the audit period,

are we supposed to engage in

MR. DIGGES:

11

No,

Your Honor.

I believe that

12

the administrative decision is the proper factfinder and

13

that the decision found simply that firmco did not cffer

14

any evidence to support any conclusion ether than that

15

the sales at issue were prompted by in-state

solicitation.

17

Well, we should -- we should net

You should not

misinterpretation of the facts at hand.

Mr. Geary's testimony plainly establishes that

with regard to all of the salesmen of all of the

that would necessarily include determination of a

19

customer’s wants and needs, to some extent were

20

customized products made for special uses for the

21

customers, checking customer satisfaction with previous

22

orders, and soliciting future business.

And we contend that

23

The State of West Virginia submits that Armco,

24

pursuant to such activities, clearly was engaging in the

25

business of selling in West Virginia, and that such
26

activities furnished the state sufficient nexus for
their taxation.
flrmcc does net contend that its business
activities do not constitute engaging in the business of
selling.

However, they feel that those activities, like

in Standard Pressed Steel, are too thin and
inconsequential to satisfy constitutional nexus tests.
Naturally, the State of West Virginia
disagrees with that proposition.

We feel that this

Court's decisions have clearly held that the business of
selling's taxable event to be those activities resulting
in the establishment and maintenance of the sales taxed.
In the General Meters case versus Washington,
the operating incidence of the selling privilege was
held to be taxable activities resulting in the
establishment and maintenance of sales and those which
make possible the continuance of valuable contractual
relations.
Similarly, in Standard Pressed Steel, the
business of selling was viewed as these activities which
make possible the realization and continuance of
valuable contractual relationships.
We, therefore, conclude that in both instances
solicitation activities were the most significant aspect
of the business of selling, and where they occurred

18

Norton and McCloud cases, as — as we discussed.

The State of West Virginia submits that a

19

re-evaluation of this fixed presence principle is called

20

for in light of intervening decisions.

21

Complete Auto Transit v. Brady announced this

22

Court's intention to judge state taxes' validity

In his dissent in the McCloud case, Justice

West Virginia also believes that this Court’s

elimination of the direct versus indirect distinction

15

with regard to privileged taxation of interstate

16

commerce also plainly supports their position that the

17

solicitation activities by themselves can supply the

18

nexus necessary to tax.

19

In the Washington Stevedoring case, this Court

20

held that since interstate commerce was subject to

21

direct taxation, an activity which was essentially a

22

part of interstate commerce could supply the nexus

23

necessary for its taxation.

24

We believe that the same logic is equally
applicable to solicitation activities.

Those such

activities are essentially a part of interstate

commerce.

It is, therefore, Appellee's position that

Armco’s in-state solicitation activities, which are

essential to the establishment and maintenance of its

to solicitation activities a fixed local presence is

How do you justify it?
First of all, as I said, in the

8

Henneford case there the same situation was presented in

9

which one commodity could be subject tc both a sales and

10

Since it wasn't, this Court refrained from

11

determining whether or not that multiple taxation would

12

be discriminatory.

13

that — that this Court was not sure that that type cf

14

activity would be discriminatory, but it was going to

16

actually before it was going tc make that -- make that

MR. DIGGESi

QUESTION:

5

MR. DIGGESi

Yes, Your Honor.
Mould the case be any different?
Certainly it would.

We would

6

then be enticing people to come into the state to

7

perform a manufacturing activity and, in effect,

8

lowering their total tax burden.

9
10

QUESTION;

We're not doing that.

Well, are we to decide cases up

here according to the rate that West Virginia imposes?

11

MR. DIGGES;

I believe that in cases such as

12

the Boston Stock Exchange case and the Maryland v.

13

Louisiana case that, in effect, the -- the total tax

14

burden in a dollars and cents fashion was -- was the

15

controlling aspect of the case.
QUESTION:

16

I think this gets you into the

17

situation that Justice O'Connor proposed, that when you

18

take the other states’ taxes into consideration, you’re

19

almost bound to end up with discrimination.
MR. DIGGESi

20

Yes, Your Honor.

And that was my

21

-- my point about the Washington State tax.

Their

22

practical effect of their tax is the same as West

23

Virginia’s.

24

taxes that have already been paid under manufacturing,

25

the

NR. DIGGES;

14
15

Then where -- where is the dividing
88 percent?

Forty percent?

Twenty-cne percent I would — 26

percent in this.
No, Your Honcr, I — I think that's — that as

16
17

long as they could come into the state and receive no

18

less of a tax burden, then I don’t believe that that

19

would be any — any influence upon them to withdraw an

20

interstate activity and make it a purely intrastate

21

activi ty.

22

QUESTION;

Well, doesn't the problem come from

23

the interaction of the manufacturing tax and the — the

24

tax on the sale price?

25

MR. DIGGES:

Yes, Your Honor.
41

Exactly.

1

QUESTION!

And that's the difficulty.

West

2

Virginia could eliminate the problem by reducing its

3

manufacturing tax on those who sell out of state or by

4

eliminating the tax cn the sale in-state,

5

both.

6

interaction sort of a problem, doesn’t it?

And so that leaves you with some kind of an

MB. DIGGESi

7

but it wants

Well, I believe that the state

8

should

be allowed to compensate in the manner it wishes

9

and to compensate for sales actually made in West

10

Virginia, to note that that is part of the manufacturing

11

process is the sale of the product, and to compensate

12

for an actual burden imposed by West Virginia law and

13

choose net to compensate for a potential burden out cf

14

state.

15

improper handling of the situation.

And I don't think that that -- that’s an

However, again back to the State cf

16
17

Washington, as — as you said, it's the interaction

18

between the two taxes.

19

would have the exact same interaction.

20

manufactures in Washington does not have to pay a

21

manufacturing tax if he pays the wholesale sales tax.

22

So, in effect, in a hypothetical situation described by

23

Armco,

24

manufacturing tax and then was — and sold his goods in

25

either the State of Washington cr the State of West

In the State of Washington you
A person who

if an individual was paying an cut-cf-state

42

1

Virginia, he would be subject to tax under two

2

privileges, whereas the in-state manufacturer-wholesaler

3

would only be subject to tax under one privilege.

4

It's the exact same question.

This Court

5

examined that situation in both the Standard Pressed

6

Steel

7

no multiple burden actually did exist, and therefore,

8

that this Court was not going to — not going to examine

9

that issue until an actual multiple burden was -- was

10

and the General Motors cases and determined that

shown .
And, again, Armco's situation is entirely

11

12

hypothetical.

They -- they don't pay any taxes in the

13

State of Ohio on the manufacture of this product; and so

14

their situation is just hypothetical and one that this

15

Court should not address at this time to -QUESTION;

16

Well, we're certainly going to have

17

to address the issue, and to arrive at your result, it

18

seems to me like you have to do away with the

19

discrimination in some manner.

20

because the local manufacturer pays a manufacturing tax.
MR. DIGGES;

21

And you say well, it's

I think that that's — under —

22

under

the Caskey case it's a type of compensating tax,

23

and I

don't believe that the compensation, again, could

24

be upset by the fact that hypothetically someone outside

25

the state may have to pay another case cn it.
43

Eut,

1

again,

2

this under this Court's decisions.

I don't — I don't see — see the relevance of

3

QUESTION*

I'm not sure I understand you.

4

you saying it's totally irrelevant whether there's a

5

manufacturing tax imposed in Ohio, for example?

6

that's where its plants are.

7

MR. DIGGES*

Assume

If it — if -- if that was --

8

were the case and that was shown, no, then that would

9

not be irrelevant.

10
11

QUESTION!

Are

So the constitutionality of the

West Virginia tax depends on what Ohio does?
MR. DIGGES:

12

It depends on whether the

13

taxpayer before this Gourt can show an actual multiple

14

burden .
QUESTION*

15

Right.

But I mean assuming he

16

proved all the relevant facts, then the critical fact

17

then would be what the Chic legislature decided to dc

18

with respect to the manufacturing tax -MR. DIGGES:

19

Well, again, Your Honor, I — I

20

— I don't know that that would be the type of

21

discrimination that this Court — this Court has -- has

22

outlawed.

23

versus use distinction was that -- that possibly because

24

it would be subject to two taxes, whereas a purely

25

in-state activity would only be subject to one, the

As I said in the Henneford case, the sales

44

1

Court said that that necessarily wasn't a type of

2

discri mina tion.
In several of this Court’s decisions they’ve

3
4

said that the vagaries of one state's taxing scheme will

5

not be forced to concede to another's, such as the — I

6

believe the Mobil Oil case in which it was whether cr

7

not the State of New York had the right to tax the

8

dividends, all of the dividends, whereas there was an

9

apportionment problem.
Again, this Court said well, that may be the

10
11

case,

but it’s not shown here,

and one system shouldn't

12

necessarily have to — have to — have to take into

13

recognition what other states are doing.

Thank you, Your Honor.
