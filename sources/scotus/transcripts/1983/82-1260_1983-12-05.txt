ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GRISWOLD:

This case is here on certiorari from the Seventh

Circuit.

It is an antitrust case turning on the

construction of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
Put briefly the issue is whether a corporation

12

and its wholly-owned subsidiary can provide the two

13

parties necessary to provide a combination or conspiracy

14

under Section 1.

15

The wholly-owned subsidiary here is the

16

Petitioner Regal Tube Company which the other Petitioner

13

manufacturer of structural steel tubing with about 14

Copperweld was never in this business and did
not compete with Regal.
Copperweld manufactures, among other things,

wire and cable and tubing which is used to transport gases

and liquids.

Upon purchasing Regal, Copperweld caused it to

2

be organized as a separate subsidiary for tax purposes.

3

All of the stock in Regal was owned by Copperweld.

4

Regal's officers and directors were Copperweld's officers

5

and directors and Regal's corporate headquarters are in

All of

The Regal business had been previously owned by

as an unincorporated division.

It had been run

David Grohne, one of the

10

counterdefendants below, was president of the Regal

11

Division under Lear Siegler.

12

Just before Regal was sold to Copperweld, Grohne

13

accepted a position as Lear Siegler's corporate secretary.

14

Within a few months though, Grohne decided to establish

15

his own steel tubing business.

The Petitioners, with the advice of counsel,
sent out letters designed to protect Copperweld's interest
in designs, plans, drawings, and trade secrets and to
prevent third parties from developing reliance interests
in dealing with Independence.

One of these letters was sent to Yoder.

Yoder

then cancelled its acceptance of the purchase order for a

3

tubing mill.

which furnished the mill and the Respondent Independence

commenced operations in September 1974, nine months later

than would have happened if Yoder had delivered the tubing

mill originally ordered.

However, Independence found another supplier

The present suit was commenced in the Northern
District of Illinois in 1976.

It contained three counts.

10

The first of these was under Section 1 of the Sherman Act

11

and it alleged that Copperweld and Regal, together with

12

Phillip Smith, the chairman and chief executive officer of

13

both companies, had conspired with Yoder to restrict trade

14

in the market for structural steel tubing.

15

The second count alleged that the Petitioners

16

and Smith had attempted to monopolize the market for steel

17

tubing in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

18

And the third count alleged that the Petitioners

19

and Smith had interfered with the Respondent's contractual

20

relations with Yoder, a state law tort.

21

Before the trial began, the Respondent dismissed

22

this claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, that is the

23

attempt-to-monopolize claim.

24

all counts in which he was named.

25

It also dismissed Smith from

The case thus went to trial on two counts, one

The only issue here is whether the tort

liability is also an antitrust liability under Section 1

17

of the Sherman Act with the damages consequently tripled

under the antitrust laws.

The question at the heart of this case has a
long history, going back at least to this Court's decision
in the Yellow Cab case in 1947.

The Court's opinion there

said that an unreasonable restraint may result as readily
from a conspiracy among those who are affiliated or
integrated under common ownership as from a conspiracy
among those who are otherwise independent.

1

Nearly everyone is agreed that those words were

2

unnecessary to the result in that case, but as Professor

3

Areeda has said, the Court's language has come to have an

4

independent significance.

5

That is, indeed, somewhat surprising since the

6

Yellow Cab case is really one of those phantom cases for

7

the defendants there eventually prevailed.

8

went back to District Court for retrial, that court found

9

that the operating companies had not been acquired

When the case

10

unlawfully and the resulting judgment for the defendants

11

was affirmed by this Court.

12

Since then the problem in various forms has come

13

here in a number of cases.

These are discussed fully in

14

the briefs of the parties.

I rely on all of the arguments

15

there but perhaps I can make a contribution by emphasizing

10

one aspect of our approach.

17

The antitrust arguments treat the question on a

18

broad canvas.

19

laws which spin everything out in great detail so that the

20

role of the courts if often to try to fit the precisely-

21

22

The antitrust laws are not like the tax

stated provisions together somewhat like a jigsaw puzzle.
In the antitrust field, the statutory provisions

23

are general and much of the law has been made by the

24

courts, particularly by this Court.

25

Because of the need for this general approach in
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

many antitrust cases, it may have been overlooked that the

2

decision in this case can best be obtained by focusing on

3

what the statute does say and specifically on Section 1 of

4

the Sherman Act.

5

page two of our brief, the blue-covered brief, and careful

6

consideration of their words will, I suggest, help to

7

resolve the issue here.
Section 1 relates to concerted action, the kind

8
9

Section 1 and Section 2 are quoted on

of risk which lies behind the concept of conspiracy and

10

the criminal law.

Every contract combination in the form

11

of trust or otherwise or conspiracy shall be illegal.
All of these words contemplate multiple actors.

12

13

It takes two to tango and it takes at least two to make

14

the sort of contract or combination or to enter into a

15

conspiracy of the sort with which Congress was concerned.
Section 2 is the standard anti-remedy for

16
17
18
19

20

misconduct by a single actor, but it requires a monopoloy
or dangerous probability of monopoly.

Neither is present

here since Regal had only 14 percent of the relevant
market.

Moreover, as I have said, the count based on

21

Section 2 was dismissed before trial by the District

22

Judge.

23
24
25

Now let us look closely at Section 1.

It is

said that there are two entities, the parent and its
wholly-own subsidiary.

I suggest that Section 1 is
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

properly construed to apply only when there are two or

2

more parties who are acting independently of each other.
Section 1, based as it was on the history of

3
4

Standard Oil, focuses on the increased economic power, the

5

increased threat to competition which results from the

6

joining together of two or more independent centers of

7

initiative and finance through combination in restraint of

8

trade and that is, indeed, the construction which has been

9

given to the statute in analogous circumstances.
QUESTION:

10

Dean Griswold, would you think that

11

would be possible if, despite complete ownership, there

12

were different officers and directors of the two

13

companies?

14

MR. GRISWOLD:

I think that no matter how the

15

intraenterprise organization is carried out, the

16

subsidiary is always subject to the complete control of

17

the parent.

18

QUESTION:

Does it matter if it is anything over

19

51 percent ownership or do you get different questions if

20

it isn't 100 percent?

21

22
23
24
25

MR. GRISWOLD:
question here.

We don't need to decide that

Here is it wholly owned.

QUESTION:

That is true, but, of course,

you would have to look to the future.
MR. GRISWOLD:

I would think that a good

1

approach would be in such a case when it comes up that if

2

the corporation was subject to — if the subsidiary was

3

subject to the legal control of the parent, that the same

4

rule ought to apply.

5

applicable in those cases.

6

complete ownership.

7

QUESTION:

There may well be different factors
This is a case of 100 percent

Well, may I ask, Dean Griswold,

8

suppose — As I understand it Regal and Copperweld really

9

functioned in different markets and produced different

10

products.

11

refuse to sell some important component that it produced

12

to a potential competitor or subsidiary of Regal.

13

assume that.

14

approach would be protected?

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Just

Would that be in agreement that on your

MR. GRISWOLD:

15
16

Suppose that Regal had persuaded Copperweld to

No.

On the position which I am

advancing, Regal would still be a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Copperweld.

It could have been that certain of the

individuals who work in connection with Regal made that
agreement with the individuals who worked in connection
with Copperweld, but they always remain subject to the
control of Copperweld and, moreover, that is not this
case.

In this case, the officers and directors of the two

companies were the same and there was no such agreement.
QUESTION:

Yes, but I guess I correctly

understand your argument as being no matter what the
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

agreement may be, if one is wholly owned by the other, it

2

can never be a conspiracy within Section 1.

3

MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, Mr. Justice, that would be

4

my argument, but we don't need to go quite that far to

5

decide this case.

6
7

QUESTION:

Well, we certainly have to consider

that possibility, don't we, in deciding this case?

8

MR. GRISWOLD:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Almost —

How far your proposition, if we take

it, is to take us.
MR. GRISWOLD:

You would have to say that some

12

of your language used in earlier opinions was not required

13

for the decisions in those cases and may have been too

14

broad, and as so often happens in the development of law,

15

should now be qualified.

16

which you did handle in the GTE Sylvania case which was

17

just referred to, not to mention the Genesee Chief, Erie

18

Railroad and Tompkins and a good many other cases.

19

20

QUESTION:

Do you think we would have to

repudiate any holdings, Mr. Griswold?

21

MR. GRISWOLD:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

It is not unlike the situation

Do I think —

Do you think we would have to

repudiate any holdings as opposed to any language?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Kiefer-Stewart.

The only one that worries me is

I think all of the writers — And the
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

writers are all opposed to the sweeping scope of some of

2

this Court's statements.

3

agreed that the cases, including Yellow Cab, are rather

4

readily distinguishable except possibly Kiefer-Stewart.

I think all of the writers are

However, the consequence of Kiefer-Stewart, as

5

6

in Timpken and in some other cases, is simply that the

7

company converted its wholly-owned subsidiary into a

8

division and that is the way it has continued since.

9

it makes no antitrust nor academic sense to say that there

And,

10

can be a conspiracy with a wholly-owned subsidiary, but

11

not with a division.
And, the Court can rely on one of its own

12

13

decisions in reaching this result for in Sunkist against

14

Winckler and Smith the Court said that it was confronted

15

with the question of whether three interrelated entities

16

can be considered independent parties for the purposes of

17

the conspiracy provisions of Sections 1 and 2 of the

18

Sherman Act and the Court's answer was we conclude not.
There is further reference in the opinion of the

19

20
21

fact that the entities were not independent and I suggest
that that is the key to this decision.
For example —

QUESTION:

23

wasn't it?
MR. GRISWOLD:

It was

Such a result is purely formalistic,

In particular, the distinction between

12
13

corporation and division is quite without any substantive

14

antitrust significance.

15

More than 28 years ago the Attorney General's

16

committee to study the antitrust laws and commenting on

17

the Yellow Cab opinion observed — and this is in part in

16

answer to the question of Justice Brennan — they said it

19

is obviously unrealistic to expect or to command

20

wholly-owned affiliates to compete.

21

Most of the difficulty in the lower courts in

22

these cases have come from the fact that they have been

23

unable, in the words of Chief Judge Cummings below, to

24

re-examine the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine root and

25

branch.

We submit that it should be re-examined here and
14

the judgment should be reversed.

2

May I say to Justice O'Connor, my colleague, Mr.

3

Baker, calls my attention to the fact that the Parke-Davis

4

case is not cited in any of the briefs and it is a

5

vertical price fixing case which seems to be somewhat

6

different from this.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.
AS AMICI CURIAE

9
10

11
12

Mr. Wallace?

MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The purpose of the Sherman Act is to promote

13

competition, not, of course, for competition's own sake,

14

but, as the Court has pointed out in Northern Pacific and

15

Broadcast Music, as a means to encourage efficiency in the

16

use of resources for the ultimate economic benefit of the

17

society as a whole.

18

Section 2 of the Act, the Act's build-in

19

paradox, preserves competition by prohibiting competitive

20

behavior that threatens monopolization.

21

prohibited whether engaged in individually or by

22

collaboration and regardless of the form of internal

23

organization the transgressing enterprise has adopted.

24
25

That behavior is

And, Section 2's limitations on competitive
behavior are supplemented by the prohibition of unfair
15

AUJERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

methods of competition in Section 5 of the Federal Trade

2

Commission Act and by State Unfair Trade Practice laws

3

such as we have seen in this case, the tort action for

4

interference with contractual relations, for interference

5

with business relations, or for business slander.

6

All of these as well apply regardless of whether

7

there has been collaboration and regardless of the form of

8

internal business organization that has been involved.

9
10
11
12

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, has Section 5 as a

practical matter been used frequently?
MR. WALLACE:

Not frequently, but there is

potential for use there that could go beyond Section 2.

13

The basic principle of antitrust is that within

14

these relatively peripheral limitations on its individual

15

behavior, each enterprise will be spurred on by the much

16

more extensive prohibitions on collaboration to compete

17

and, thereby, to achieve greater economic efficiencies,

18

whether those efficiences are in scientific or

19

technological advance, in product design, in improved

20
21

22
23

distribution methods, or in improvements in management
such as better utilization of personnel or changes in the
form of internal business organization.
Now, laws with other objectives such as

24

securities laws or state corporation laws may impose some

25

restriction on an enterprise's flexibility to change its
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

2

internal business organization.
But, the question before the Court today is

3

whether the antitrust laws themselves should be

4

interpreted to impose an additional inhibition on an

5

enterprise's ability to adopt various forms of internal

6

business organization.

7

The view of the United States and of the Federal

8

Trade Commission is that it is self-contradictory for the

9

antitrust laws to be interpreted to impede this particular

10

avenue of achieving efficiencies, to impede this

11

particular way of competing.

12

We are not dealing here with a paradox like

13

Section 2 that ultimately furthers the overall larger

14

purposes of the Sherman Act, but here we are dealing with

15

a self-contradiction that detracts from the achievement of

10

those purposes.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, may I ask one question?

18

You have emphasized the internal operations of affiliated

19

group of companies.

20

report in 1955 drew a distinction which may or may not be

21

valid between internal and external activities.

22

the position of the Department of Justice today on the

23

views of the Attorney General's committee in 1955?

24
25

The Attorney General's committee

MR. WALLACE:

What is

We don't believe that that is a

valid basis for distinction here.
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Now, it is true that intraenterprise conspiracy

2

can be referred to or relied on in situations where

3

fortuitously there is reason in furthering the policies of

4

the antitrust laws to find a violation.

5

In our brief, we attempted to show that many of

6

this Court's decisions can be explained that way.

But, in

7

any instance where it is useful to the objectives of the

8

antitrust laws to do that, it would be equally useful to

9

do it if the same effect were achieved through operation

10

by divisions that had the same external effects rather

11

than the fact that there happened to be a separate

12

corporation in the internal organization of the

13

enterprise.

14

So, the reliance on the corporate form, seems to

15

us, only to obscure the proper antitrust analysis and at

16

the same time to deter flexibility in organizing the

enterprise.

18

QUESTION:

Would you take the view that the

19

activity shown by this record, if performed by independent

20

corporations, constituted a violation of Section 1?

21

22
23

And,

if so, why is it worse if they are affiliated?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I haven't really considered

whether there would be a violation of Section 1 if these

24

were independent organizations.

25

a basis for at least a rule of reason argument, if not a

There certainly would be

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

per se argument, that there was a violation here and there

2

was a finding of tortious interference with contract.

3

The point that I am trying to make here is that

4

while an external effects test seems to implicate

5

antitrust policies and objectives, it really is a form in

6

the intraenterprise conspiracy context of expanding the

7

restraints on unilateral behavior, what is essentially

8

unilateral behavior, without facing up to the question

9

whether Section 2 of the Act should be read that

10

expansively because the fact that that is the form of

11

internal organization of the defendant organization really

12

is a fortuity from the standpoint of the ability of that

13

organization to achieve the same economic result through

14

the same activity.

15

Now, it is true that competition within an

16

enterprise can have beneficial effects and that is perhaps

17

one of the confusing factors in this field.

18

proper role of the antitrust laws in our view is to

19

encourage those benefits only indirectly as matters of

20

managerial discretion.

21

very simple example of the kind of beneficial effects that

22

can result.

23

But, the

This becomes very apparent in a

Rivalry between two clerks in a department store

24

can result in much better service to the customers in a

25

particular situation.

But, it is obvious to everyone that
19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

the extent to which the clerks shall compete with each

2

other and the extent to which they will cooperate must be

3

a matter of managerial discretion, that the clerks

4

certainly cannot be cut off from each other in the kinds

5

of exchanges of information that may be inappropriate

6

between independent enterprises and that what counts is

7

that the management of Macy's is competing with Gimball's

8

across the way and will develop whatever mix of rivalry

9

and cooperation within the enterprise that best serves

10

that competition.
There is really no difference in principle in

11
12

the more complicated question of cooperation or

13

competition between divisions of an enterprise like

14

General Motors or cooperation or competition between

15

separately incorporated subsidiaries.
What we are speaking of here does not, in our

16
17

view and contrary to the submission made in the briefs on

18

the other side, require the Court to adopt an exemption

19

from the antitrust laws which exemptions are not lightly

20

implied.

21

The question of exemption arises when a statute

other than the antitrust laws is being construed to

22

determine whether by implication or otherwise it exempts

23

certain conduct from the scope of those laws.

24

question purely of construing the Sherman Act itself and

25

This is a

the exemption cases do not apply here.
20

Then in response to one other question, we don't

1

2

think this can be limited to the 100 percent situation

3

because some of the most pro-competitive aspects of

4

separate incorporation are the ability to diversify the

5

stock ownership to some extent.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

7

Your time has expired,

Mr. Wallace.

8

Mr. Grimm?

9

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR E. GRIMM, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. GRIMM:

11

12
13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this case autonomously operated parent and

14

subsidiary corporations acted in concert to exclude a new

15

competitor from the market.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Grimm, could

17

Copperweld have avoided all this difficulty had it just

18

made this a division when it acquired Regal?

19

20
21

22
23

MR. GRIMM:

Well, there certainly is a

distinction that is made in the statute.
QUESTION:

No, but — Would it have avoided any

Section 1 problems if it had done it that way?
MR. GRIMM:

If there had not been a separate

24

corporation, there would not be a Section 1 claim

25

particularly because the statute requires the existence of
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

two separate legal persons which this Court has always

2

held.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. GRIMM:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
As a threshold matter.
Are there some reasons independent of

6

antitrust considerations perhaps which explains why they

7

didn't do it that way?
MR. GRIMM:

8
9

There — It was somewhat conflicting

evidence in the record on this point.

The Petitioners

10

gave some testimony to the effect that there were tax

11

considerations.

12

There was also evidence in the record that the Copperweld

13

Corporation wanted it subsidiaries to stand on their own

14

two feet, to be, in effect, independent businesses in the

15

competitive market.

They wanted to avoid some state tax.

The question essentially before the Court in

16
17

this case is whether the anticompetitive conduct engaged

18

in by Petitioners should now be excused from antitrust

19

coverage?

20

There are three basic points which I should like

21

to address bearing upon this issue.

First, the language

22

of the statute, including its legislative history, and the

23

proper distinction between corporate divisions and

24

subsidiaries, as well as the relationship between Sections

25

1 and 2 of the statute.
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

Secondly, the applicable Supreme Court decisions

1

2

which uniformly conclude that concerted anticompetitive

3

conduct can come within Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
And, third, the proper standard to be applied in

4
5

cases of this kind.
But, first there are a couple of observations

6
7

which I believe are important concerning the facts of this

8

case.

9

acts of Petitioners caused the complete exclusion of a

First, there was simply no question but that the

10

competitor from a market for a substantial period of time.

11

That exclusion resulted in a clearly demonstrated

12

restraint of trade under a rule of reason analysis.

13

Price competition was frustrated, product supply

14

was reduced during a period of serious product shortage.

15

These facts are important, we submit, because this Court

16

has always held that the Sherman Act must be interpreted

17

in light of its fundamental objective; that is

18

preservation of competition.

19

of Petitioners seriously undermined that objective.

20

QUESTION:

In this instance, the acts

Well, if the Petitioners had not been

21

separately incorporated and it had been a division within

22

corporation, would there have been liability?

23

MR. GRIMM:

There would not have been liability

24

under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, because, as we point

25

out, Section 1 of the Sherman Act deals solely with the
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

question of the activity of separate legal persons.

2

is a threshold requirement of Section 1 of the statute.

3

QUESTION:

Well, that is really a question so I

4

am not sure the consequences of the action are as

5

significant as you suggest.

6

MR. GRIMM:

The consequences of the action are

7

significant for this reason, because the fundamental

8

objective, as we point out of the Sherman Act, is the

9

preservation of competition.

Therefore, the language of

10

the Sherman Act, we suggest, should be interpreted to

11

apply to those situations where it properly can be so

12

interpreted based upon that language if there has, in

13

fact, been a subversion of competition.

14

That

This, we would point out, is not simply a case

15

of an isolated interference with contract.

16

broad scale efforts on the part of the Petitioners here to

17

induce and to coerce other firms to refrain with dealing

18

with Independence Tube Corporation.

19

20

There were

For example, when Regal learned that
Independence would be entering the market as a competitor,

21

it recruited Copperweld to help take action in response to

22

Independence's impending entry.

23

The Petitioners —

24

QUESTION:

25

That would have been — To pursue the

other question submitted, would the mechanism have been

MR. GRIMM:

QUESTION:

5

The mechanism may or may not have

Would the control have been any

different?
MR. GRIMM:

6

The control would have have been —

7

May have been considerably different, that is control by

8

the parent of its subsidiary.

9

QUESTION:

10

With common directors and common

chariman of the board and officers?
MR. GRIMM:

11

The evidence in this case

12

demonstrated that despite the fact that there were common

13

directors and officers, the real decisions, as the Court

14

of Appeals pointed out, both in day-to-day operations and

15

in major policy decisions, were made at the subsidiary

16

level.

17

separate business unit even though there were common

18

directors.

Indeed, the subsidiary functioned essentially as a

QUESTION:

19

Isn't that commonly true of division

20

of large organizations, day-to-day operations are in the

21

hands of the division?
MR. GRIMM:

22

Divisions may function with some

23

autonomy.

The distinction between a subsidiary and a

24

division comes from the language of the statute itself.

25

This Court has always interpreted Section 1 of the Sherman
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Act to require the existence of two separate legal

2

persons.

3

legal person and, therefore, would be incapable of meeting

4

that threshold requirement.

An unincorporated division is not a separate

I think it is also important to note that there

5

6

is some historical explanation to that distinction as

7

well.
In 1890, of course, Congress was aware of

8
9

corporations and, indeed, of affiliated corporations, but

10

autonomous or even the existence of unincorporated

11

divisions did not exist in 1890.

12

to be directed toward those kinds of entities which did

13

exist.

The statute was framed

So, the language itself drew the line — The

14
15

statute itself drew the line on the basis of independent

16

entity, business entity and along the line of the concepts

17

of common law conspiracy which, of course, also requires

18

the existence of two separate legal persons.
There seems to be, we would submit, some

19

20

substance to this distinction as well.

21

division, while it may, as Your Honor points out, exists

22

with significant autonomy, nevertheless, there are some

23

An unincorporated

important things that an unincorporated division is not

24

capable of doing which has significance in the market

25

place.

An unincorporated division is incapable of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

engaging in a contract in its own name and in its own

2

identity.

3

restraint of trade or otherwise.

It is incapable of engaging in a contract in

4

So, we would submit that there is some logic to

5

drawing the line where the statute seems to draw the line

6

and that is on the basis of legal entity, because an

7

unincoporated division in reality cannot perform all of

8

the functions that a separately incorporated legal entity

9

can by virtue of the legal privileges which the law

10

attributes to separate incorporation.
QUESTION:

11

What position do you take if the

12

board of directors are identical and the officers are

13

identical?
MR. GRIMM:

14

That was substantially the fact

15

here.

The important inquiry, we submit, is that one must

16

look at the realities of the operation.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. GRIMM:

Are the —

That is what I am trying to do.
Are the officers really performing a

19

function of running the business, the officers of the

20

parent that is, or is the business really being run, as in

21

this case, by either officers of the subsidiary or by the

22

executive —
QUESTION:

23
24
25

In my hypothetical, the officers are

identical.
MR. GRIMM:

And, the inquiry, I would submit,
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 30001 (203) 628-8300

1

where there are identical officers is whether the officers

2

are dominating the operation of both corporations in

3

day-to-day operations and in policy decisions or whether,

4

in fact, the actual operation of the subsidiary is run by

5

those who are not running the parent corporation which is

6

the case here.
QUESTION:

7

8

How in the world — Do you want to

give them a lie detector test or something?
MR. GRIMM:

9

No.

The Court of Appeals in this

10

case, and the District Court as well, identified a number

11

of factors which determines whether or not corporations

12

are being run with real and substantive autonomy.

13

identifies a list of factors which Professor Sullivan, in

14

his antitrust treatise identified, which considers such

15

matters as who is really making the decisions as to the

16

long-term planning of this corporation?

17

or is it someone at the subsidiary who is not a part of

18

the parent?

Is it the parent

Do you mean you would find that the

board of directors would act differently when they are

sitting in the subsidiary board meeting than they were

here?

Would they be hostile by any chance?

MR. GRIMM:

24

really a question —

No, they wouldn't be hostile.

Is there any way in the world

I think the important point —
QUESTION:

Is there anything that they could do

11

that the independent person couldn't do?

12

up that they are not independent, are they?

13

MR. GRIMM:

I think it adds

Well, I would refer the Court, if I

14

may, to the Joint Appendix which sets forth an affidavit

15

at page A-103 which is the affidavit of the general

16

manager of Regal Tube Company in which he identifies all

17

of the activities in which he has sole responsibility for

18

operation of the subsidiary corporation and that it is not

19

the board of directors in that sense who was running the

20

corporation either in terms of long-term policy decisions

21

or in terms of day-to-day activities.

22

So, the question is who is really running the

23

corporation as an actual matter of reality as

24

distinguished from who might ultimately have the power to

25

change the corporate setup or to even sell the stock of

QUESTION:

Mr. Grimm, who controls the profits

of the subsidiary in this case?
MR. GRIMM:

In this case, the general manager of

5

the subsidiary was solely responsible for developing a

6

profit for the subsidiary corporation.

7

8
9

QUESTION:

But, when he made a profit, who

controlled it?
MR. GRIMM:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GRIMM:

Who receives the profit?
Yes.
The parent corporation by virtue of

12

its stock ownership would ultimately benefit from that

13

profit, of course.

14
15

QUESTION:

Were consolidated returns filed both

to the public and the SEC?

16

MR. GRIMM:

The consolidated tax returns, I

17

believe, were filed.

I believe that SEC requirements

18

compelled the filing of consolidated —

QUESTION:

20

MR. GRIMM:

21

22
23
24
25

But, they were filed?
They were filed in accordance with

the SEC requirements as I understand it.
QUESTION:

Was there any limitation on capital

expenditures by the subsidiary?
MR. GRIMM:

There were some restrictions,

although again there is conflicting evidence on this

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) «20-8300

point.

The general manage of the subsidiary had the

2

authority to make capital expenditures up to a certain

3

level.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. GRIMM:

What was the level?
There is conflicting evidence on

6

what the level was. Ten thousand dollars was one of the

7

points of testimony.

8

QUESTION:

9

$10,000, could you?

10

MR. GRIMM:

QUESTION:

MR. GRIMM:

Yes.

responsibility for making a profit.

QUESTION:

6

Corporate acquisitions were not

approved by the board of directors of the parent?
MR. GRIMM:

7

Well, the corporate acquisitions

8

would have been subject to approval, but he was

9

essentially responsible for identifying and developing

10

those opportunities.
QUESTION:

11
12

That would be true if it were a

division of a central corporation, would it not?

13

MR. GRIMM:

14

QUESTION:

It presumably would be depending —
The management of the division is

supposed to move out on its own and look for more

business.

20
21

22
23
24
25

MR. GRIMM:

Certainly a division can be

established in that way.

I have no question about that.

I think that on the question of the relationship
between the parent and subsidiary, there are a number of
case of this Court which are instructive on whether or not
a combination can exist in a situation where there is
influence of dominance or coercion between the parties.
This Court in the case of Albrecht versus the
Herald Company, for example, held in a case that involved
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

a principal and an agent where the agent is under the

2

total dominance and control of the principal and carries

3

out an anticompetitive objective, that the principal and

4

the agent, even though the agent is totally under the

5

domination and control of the principal, but is

6

nevertheless a separate legal entity.

7

anticompetitive restraint is worked, the Court held that

8

that was a combination where the agent materially aided in

9

the advancement of that objective.

10

QUESTION:

If an

Tell me, Mr. Grimm, is there any

11

decision of this Court construing Section 1 as you suggest

12

it should be construed?

13

MR. GRIMM:

14

QUESTION:

Is there any decision —
Is there any decision of this Court

15

which says that if they are two independent — in the

16

sense that they are two corporate parties here that any

17

agreement between them is a violation of Section 1?

18

MR. GRIMM:

There are a number of cases which

19

hold that corporate affiliation is not a defense.

20

beginning really with the Standard Oil case and coming

21

down all the way to the Perma Life case.

22

QUESTION:

And,

Yellow Cab —

Do you read those as holding that

23

because there are two independent corporations here that

25

MR. GRIMM:

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

QUESTION:

Are you arguing that if that is a

11

matter of statutory construction that ordinarily if that

12

is to be changed, that is for Congress not for us to do?

13

MR. GRIMM:

Absolutely.

In Timken versus the

14

United States, for example, this Court was presented with

15

the issue that is exactly the same issue that is presented

16

in this case.

17

quote the following language.

18

involved in that case over 30 years, this Court said, "if

19

such a drastic change is to be made in the statute,

20
21

23

In that holding, this Court said, and I

Congress is the one to do it."

In precisely the same issue

That is 341 U.S. 599.

I should like to turn next to a brief discussion
of the legislative history, because we submit that it
bears — it sheds light on this question.

But, even

24

before that, I think it is important to refer to the

25

language of the statute itself which provides every
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

contract combination in the form of a trust or otherwise

2

or a conspiracy in restraint of trade is declared to be

3

illegal.
Here the Petitioners were, indeed, separate

4
5

corporations.

This Court has held that that is a

6

threshold requirement.

7

unquestionably that Petitioners' activities resulted in an

8

unreasonable restraint of trade under a rule of reasoned

9

analysis.

The language of the statute was plainly

10

violated.

We submit that the basic objectives of the

11

statute and the legislative history support this

12

conclusion.

Here it has been concluded

13

Congress was clearly concerned about the

14

predatory efforts to prevent new competitiors from

15

entering into the market.

16

it clear in the legislative history that affiliated

17

corporations were indeed within the meaning of the

18

combination and conspiracy language of the statute.

19

20

Congress also, I believe, made

In 1890, of course, Congress was primarily
concerned with the anticompetitive behavior of the trusts,

21

but Congress considered those trusts to be the

22

manifestation of a more fundamental problem at which the

23

statute was aimed.

24

competition by any form of concerted action.

combinations by merger or otherwise, but with the

3

anticompetitive acts in which those combinations engaged.
The words of Senator Sherman during the

4
5

legislative debates, I think, are apt for this particular

6

case when he said that if a humble man starts in business

7

in opposition to them, they will drive him down, they will

8

crowd him down.

9

intervene and that is the kind of activity involved here,

Then it is the duty of the courts to

10

that is the kind of activity that Senator Sherman was

11

concerned about.
It is important to recognize that the trusts of

12

13

1890 were themselves groups of corporations under common

14

ownership.

15

of commonly-owned corporations in which a group of

16

trustees owned all of the stock.

The trust device was nothing more than a group

The trusts, however, were evolving into the

17
18

holding company even in 1890, which is why Congress framed

19

the statute to cover in the language of the statute,

20

combinations in the form of trust or otherwise.
Indeed, I believe that it is very important in

21

22

interpreting the word "combination" in the statute to

23

understand what was meant by that term in 1890.

24

the framers of the statute think the term "combination"

25

meant?

What did

Indeed, that term was a commonly understood and

1

well-used term.

In its simpliest form, it meant nothing

2

more than the cooperation of two or more persons to

3

achieve a given result.

4

The framers of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, we

5

submit, meant to use that term as it was commonly used at

6

the time and that is a combination meant any form of a

7

collection of persons or as the trust were a collection of

8

corporations which, when they engaged in a restraint of

9

trade, could be held to violate Section 1 of the Sherman

10

Act.

11

In light of this legislative history, this Court

12

has held in each and every case that has been presented to

13

it which involved this issue.

14

I should like to for a moment direct my

15

attention to the relationship between Section 1 and

We submit that Congress meant exactly what

Section 2, of course, also concerns attempts by

individual persons to attempt to monopolize.

The

6

Petitioners and the government in this case have suggested

7

that this Court should now hold that Section 2 of the

8

Sherman Act, that part of Section 2 which relates solely

9

to attempts to monopolize by single persons, should

10

henceforth be applied and only applied — the only section

11

of the Sherman Act to be applied to restraints of trade

12

among affiliated corporation.

13

approach strains the language of the statute itself.

14

We submit that that

15

point here.

18

these kinds of activities from the Sherman Act for this

reason, because Section 2, the attempt to monopolize

at least in recent years to apply only in those situations
in which there is a dangerous probablility of achieving
monopoly as measured by substantial market shares.

are engaged in different markets, neither one of which

combine their activities to suppress competition of third

parties, that that activity would be automatically exempt

from antitrust coverage.

I should like —

6

QUESTION:

Does the two corporate language that

7

you referred to in the statute do any more than get you

8

past the first threshold of a case?

9

was the "X" division of "Y" corporation, then you wouldn't

10

meet that threshold test, would you?

11

MR. GRIMM:

12

QUESTION:

13

That is correct.
So that the language, two

corporations, doesn't really decide very much, does it?

14

MR. GRIMM:

15

within the scope of Section 1.

16

QUESTION:

17

In other words, if it

Well, what it decides is that it is

It is one of the first questions you

asked.
MR. GRIMM:

18

It is a preliminary — It is a

19

threshold question.

20

we point out in our briefs, to apply a substantive

21

standard.

22

is appropriate in these cases is the standard which is

23

derived from the decisions of this Court.

24
25

And, beyond that it is important, as

And, as we have pointed out, the standard which

When presented with issues of this kind in the
past, this Court has concluded that there are two factors
39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

which should be considered, the effect of the activities

2

of the parties involved on competition and also the

3

operational realities of those parties.
The lower courts have applied this doctrine and

4
5

these concepts not always with the greatest precision we

6

would agree, but the results of the lower court cases are

7

essentially consistent with the two-part analysis which

8

says that whether affiliated corporations should be held

9

to have violated the statute should turn upon two factors,

10

whether they actually functioned in the market place in

11

reality as two distinct economic units and, secondly,

12

whether each corporation undertook activities to suppress

13

the trade of third parties.
And, as I point out, this is a threshold

14
15

inquiry.

16

corporations are capable of engaging in an antitrust

17

violation and not in whether an antitrust violation

18

actually occurred.

19

20
21

It is designed to determine whether those

In addition to that threshold inquiry, it would
be necessary to determine that those parties actually
formed a conspiracy within the meaning of that term under

22

the cases relating to conspiracy and it would also be

23

necesasry to establish that anticompetitive acts were

24

undertaken to destroy the competition of a third party.

25

The aspect which relates to the autonomy of

operation is designed to determine whether, as in the

2

words of the Court of Appeals in this case, there is

3

enough separation so that it is sensible to treat those

4

two separate legal units as separate economic units under

5

the Sherman Act.

6

When a separate corporation is functioning as a

7

separate economic entity into the — in the market place,

8

it enters into contracts and other business arrangements

9

which give it some economic influence.

When that economic

10

influence is combined with another separate corporation,

11

even though an affiliated corporation —

QUESTION:

But, you have conceded that the

13

parent corporation kept this subsidiary on a very tight,

14

short rein.

15

MR. GRIMM:

The evidence showed that, as I

16

pointed out, there was an affidavit, among a substantial

17

amount of other evidence, which showed that, in fact, the

18

general manager of the subsidiary had the sole

19

responsibility for operating the subsidiary.

20

The Court of Appeals addressed that question

21

very specifically and in a detailed way based upon all of

22

the evidence presented.

23

issues that was presented to the Court of Appeals by

24

Petitioners.

25

as to whether or not they could be considered separate

That was precisely one of the

Was there enough autonomy to meet that test

economic units?
The District Court in the post-trial motions and

2
3

the Court of Appeals all concluded that there was

4

sufficient and substantial autonomy both in day-to-day

5

operations and in policy decisions.
The second aspect of the test relates to the

6
7

effect of the activities on third parties, whether or not

8

significant restraints of trade are imposed on third

9

parties.
In this case, an unreasonable suppression of

10
11

competition did occur. The Sherman Act was clearly

12

intended to protect competition against such competitive

13

assaults.
