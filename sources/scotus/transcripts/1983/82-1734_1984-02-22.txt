CRAL ARGUMENT CF ROBERT J. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHAPIRC;

7

May it please the Court, this

8

case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Second

9

District Court of Appeal of the State of Florida.
The question presented is whether the equal

10
11

protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth

12

Amendment prohibits a court from considering or from

13

relying upon a subsequent interracial marriage of the

14

custodial parent as a ground for ordering a change of

15

custod y .

16

Now,

if I may, the facts are straightforward

17

in this case, and I would like to go through them very

18

quickly and get right to the argument.

QUESTION;

Is it your contention that that’s

the only ground on which the judgment is based?

The custody of their three-year-old

Subsequently, the husband -- the father, I’m

3
4

sorry — filed a petition for modification.

He alleged

5

in his petition that the mother was living with a black

6

man who she later married,

7

of head lice, and that the child had been seen wearing

8

mildewed dress.

that the child had two touts

Now, at the hearing on this matter, the final

hearing, the parties and their new spouses testified,

11

and the report of the Circuit Court counsel was

12

accepted.

March 1, 1982 changed custcday and awarded it tc the

14

father .

The Order which the Circuit Court entered on

15

There were no findings made regarding the

16

father’s secondary allegations — and it was called

17

"secondary allegations" by the trial judge — of the

18

mildewed dress or the head lice.

19

she had lived with man before marrying him.

20

a

The court noted that

Put the court also held that each of the

21

parents, the father and the mother here, were devoted

22

parents and that each had remarried respectable spouses.

23

And then in the important phrase in this case,

24

the court stated:

"This Court feels that, despite the

25

strides that have been made in bettering relations

between the races in this country, it is inevitable that

2

Melanie will, if allowed tc remain in her present

3

situation and attain school age and, thus, more

4

vulnerable to peer pressures, suffer from the social

5

stigmatization that is sure to come."
Now, it’s important to note that this is not a

There was no finding

to respondent’s arguments in his brief.

There was no

11

finding of any inability to cope on the part of the

12

The child is six years old today.

MR. SHAPIRC*

10

Yes, Ma'am.

Living with the

11

natural father in Texas, where he moved immediately

12

after the custody determination was made in March cf

'82.

13

Now, our position is, and I believe that it's

14

clear from the plain meaning of the words in the Order,

15

that the Order was tainted with race, racial

16

consideration, which renders it presumptively invalid.

17

No ether case so clearly rests a custody determination

18

on racial considerations, at least that I can find in my

19

search cf cases.
The child court took the remarriage cf the

20
21

mother into considertion solely because her new husband

22

was black.

23

father's remarriage because his new wife was white.

Eear in mind that this was foreshadowed by the
fact that the court ordered a social investigation only

of the mother, despite the fact that a motion for social

2

investigation requested a social investigation of loth

3

parties.

4

Having taken consideration of the remarriage,

5

he, then, assumed that certain consequences would occur

6:^ as a result of the interracial marriage.

And fcy this,

as a result of the interracial marriage.

9

There is net one scintilla of evidence, nor is

10

there a finding of fact that there is any adverse effect

11

as a result of this interracial marriage.

Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment embodies

13

the belief that all persons are created equal.

14

hatred and prejudice have no place in cur system of law,

but when this trial court held

as Cooper v. Aaron, Shelley v.

pressure to protect potential victims of race

discrimination from prejudice; that the desire to

protect a person from racial prejudice does not justify

departing from the fundamental command of the

And the concept of equal justice under law is

3

so central to this country that it is engraved, carved

4

into the stone of this building.

QUESTION;

Mr. Shapiro, do you think that a

6

state could, in placing a child for adoption, consider

7

the biological characteristics of the adoptive parents

8

in an effort to place the child in a family with similar

9

characteristics of the baby or child being placed?

10

ME. SHAPIRO;

Of course, as you know. Your

11

Honor, the question of adoption is much different than

12

we have here because --

13

QUESTION;

I know that.

14

ME. S HAP IRC;

15

QUESTION;

16

ME. SHAPIRO;

17

My position is that with — and I think the

Yes, Ma'am.

What is your position?
All right.

18

courts have said this -- that the concept of adoption is

19

different, because the state is conferring a right upon

20

a person who is not a biological parent and, therefore,

21

as long as there is no racial slur involved in taking

22

that into consideration, that it may -- and as long as

23

this is not automatic, as it was here, consideration of

24

race -- that it may take race into consideration.

25

And this was in the Erummond case, which was

1

the Fifth Circuit case, which made reference to this

2

Court's case in Smith v. Fester Family case, 0-f-f-e-r.

3

And there's a very, very big distinction between the

4

biological relationship and the state-ccnferred

5

relationship.
QUESTION i

6

Of course, if your client regains

7

custody, Mr. Palmore may seek, to adopt, might he net?

8

Then you would have the problems that Justice O'Conner

9

has suggested.
MR. SHAPIRO;

10

Well, but the problem there is,

11

there would be, then, a conflict between the two

12

biological parents.

court's Order determined this custody determination.

2

And he found the man tc be respectable, as was the

3

spouse, the new spouse of the father.
There's no question, he says in the first

4

5

paragraph, about the respectability of these new spouses.
Now, the other major point in this case, aside

6
7

from importing racial prejudice of society into the

8

Order of a court, is the aspect that the mother was

9

being punished for having exercised her right to marry a

10

person, without regard to race.

21

upon.

mother treated that new relationship as regards to the

12

Now, if the circuit judge was talking about

the things mentioned in sentences one, two, and three,

rather than the race business in sentence one, why would

he begin the fourth sentence with about "Despite the

20

QUESTION i

21

to the mother's incapability?

22

Where, specifically, does he speak

ME. HAWTEEYi

I don’t think he -- he

23

definitely doesn’t say it say it specifically.

But when

24

he talks about — first talking about the mother

25

bringing the man into the home, and the business about

18

440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

carrying on sexual relationships with him/

2

goes on to say, "Such action tended to place

3

gratification of her own desires ahead of her concern

4

with her children's future welfare."

5

the court

And then the court immediately talks about the

6

child's future welfare.

7

wasn't at the trial court level, but it seems to me, in

8

reading the decision, that when the court talks about

9

the mother's intending to place her own gratification

And it seems evident to me — I

10

before her child's future welfare, and then talks about

11

the future welfare, the court is saying, in essence,

12

that there is an ability of the mother to cope, and

13

therefore the child will suffer.

14

I think additionally, that the relationship,

15

the parent-spouse relation — new spouse relationship --

16

hasn't, to my way of thinking, a recognized liberty

17

interest or a right in family privacy, both of which are

18

dealt with in the cases dealing with classification of

19

family interests.

20

I don't think there’s been a showing that

21

there is either a recognized liberty interest or a

22

recognized right to family privacy.

23

QUESTION;

Well, but you don't need a

24

recognized liberty interest if your claim is under the

25

Equal Protection Clause, rather than the Due Process

19

AL0ER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

Clause, do you?
MR. HAWTREY;

2

That's correct.

But the way

3

that I have read the briefs that have been filed for the

4

mother, there lacks a distinction between due process

5

and equal protection; that the tendency is, is to

6

create, I think it's been classified as a per se

7

impermissible classification, which I would classify in

8

the nature of a suspect class, rather than merely

9

investigating whether or not there was a classification.
At this point in time, when I*m dealing only

10
11

with -- when I'm dealing with the relationship before

12

the court, I'm trying to isolate that question.

13

I think that it's clear that if we look at a

14

scales of justice analogy in this particular case, and

15

we put the parent-child relationship on one side, we can

16

put either the best interests doctrine or the material

17

and substantial change doctrine, as it applies in the

18

Florida law, on the other scale.
But if you put the parent-new spouse

19
20

relationship in one scale,

21

22

against, what the trial court was weighing that against

23

on the other side.

24
25

I don't think that there has

showing at least of what we're weighing that

QUESTION:

If you suggest that this judgment

really didn't substantially rest on a racial

20

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

consideration, you must inevitably claim that there sere

2

nonracial grounds for the action.

3

And if that's the case, you should be able to

4

win another custody case where it's made perfectly clear

5

that there's no racial factor be involved.

6

MR. HAWTREY;

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. HAWTREY:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Is that right?
That's correct.

I take it your colleague on the

10

other side suggests that there could be another custody

11

case here.

12

nonracial grounds for leaving custody where it is now.

And you seem tc think there are ample

13

MR. HAWTREY:

14

There's no question that ongoing litigation in

15

this area could take place.
QUESTION:

16
17

I believe that's correct.

Well, what nonracial matter were

you talking about when you said she couldn't cope?
MR. HAWTREY:

18

Justice Marshall,

I understand

1

that there was — that the thing that she was coping

20

with was a racial matter.

21

parent-child relationship, it was her inability to

22

relate tc her child, net her inability to relate tc the

23

ma rria ge.

24
25

Eut as regards to the

I think that her ability or inability to
relate to the marriage falls in the category of the

I don’t think that she can

9

I think that’s what the court

Since I wasn’t at the —

QUESTION;

If we don’t agree with you as to

the reading of the judge’s remarks, and if there is

10

really a racial slur, as your colleague says, in the

11

case -- let’s just assume that we disagree with you and

12

say, counsel, we just disagree with that reading.

13

Now -- and just assume that we're right in

14

reading the judge’s remarks that way.

15

your suggestion to us as to what we ought to dc?

16

MR. HAWTREY;

What would he

I think the next step is to look

17

to see if there is either a compelling cr rational

18

reason for the court’s action, whether there has been a

19

shewing that there has teen an adverse — I think it’s

20

been characterized as coercion not to marry or a penalty

21

for marriage — whether or not there is anything in the

22

trial court’s decision or in the record of the state

23

courts of Florida to show that.

24
25

QUESTION;

Nc.

If we read what the judge said

as saying the mother loses custody here because she

22

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 694300

1

married a black man

suppose we just read it that way

2

What should we do about it?

3

MR. HAWTREY:

If that's the sole question

4

before this Court, that the sole reason, that there was

5

no ethers, then the trial court has classified the

6

mother .
QUESTION:

7
8

racial reason, anyway, for determining the case.
MR. HAWTREY:

9
10

Has made a racial — has used a

Determining — yeah.

She's been

put into a classification.
The next question is whether there's any

11
12

shewing in the case or not, has there been a adverse or

13

a state action that does not either have a rational

14

relationship to the classification, or a compelling

15

state interest.
QUESTION:

16

Would you apply the arguments

17

you're advancing to every interracial marriage, without

18

respect to what races were involved?
Suppose, to take an extreme, you had American

19
20

citizens, one of China Mainland, and one of — or Taiwan

21

-- and

22

whatever.

23

an American, or Korean, or Vietname, or Thailand,
Would you advance these same arguments?
MR. HAWTREY:

I think that the question is, if

24

we're going to classify, then how are we going to use

25

that classification?

In an adoption suit or a state

23

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, 0.0 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

custody suit, where it is the state taking custody, cr

2

as in the Smith case where we're dealing with foster

3

families, I think that there are — there has been shown

4

to be reasonable state relationships, that the best

5

interest of the child is a compelling state interest

6

that override the classification.
QUESTION i

7
8

Well, isn’t your argument, when

it’s boiled down, really almost thiss

that assuming,

accepting the idea that this is a racially-based
10

decision, it is — it should be approved because of the

11

interests of the child in the present attitudes that you

12

suggest in your brief exist about these problems?

13

MR. HAWTREY;

14

classify that relationship, yes.

15

true.

16

18

That the state may justifiably
I believe that's

And I believe it would apply to any mixed race

QUESTIONS

Don’t you think the court in this

case thought sc, tc?

1

MR. HAWTREYs

I’m not sure of your question.

20

If the question is do I think that the court

21

changed the relationship merely because of the

22

interracial marriage, and that the best interests of the

23

child would not be served but for that decision, I don’t

24

agree with that.

25

I think that the court can classify the

24

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST 8T„ N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

relationship and still consider the child.

2

the court was -- had the opportunity to view the mother,

3

to listen tc arguments, to listen to all the evidence,

4

and to read that in as a adverse relationship, that the

5

modification was an adverse relationship, in other

6

words, it was either coercion or a penalty, it isn't in

7

the record and it certainly isn't in the judgment of the

8

court.
QUESTION*

10

Mr. Hawtrey,

After all,

I don't think I

understand yet.
If all that we had was a finding by the court

11
12

of the interracial marriage, and that alone was the

13

basis fcr changing custody, do you support that and

14

think that any of our cases would permit that?
ME. HAWTREY*

15
16

What I am suggesting is, is that unless there is -QUESTION*

17
18

I hope I'm not supporting that.

It sounded like you were.

And do

you think any of our cases permit that?
ME. HAWTREY*

1

To answer your second question,

20

no, I don't believe that any of the cases support that.

21

But what I think that there has to be is a showing that

22

that is a adverse effect on the child or a penalty or

23

coercion to the mother.

24
25

,

This is — we don't have a case here we have a

state action that's going to throw the mother in jail or

MR. HAWTREY;

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

at it between the parent and the child, and not the

2

parent and the new spouse,

3

the state has.

4

spouse relationship was one of either quality or

5

quantity that relates to the parent-child relationship.

6

We’re only dealing with one-half of it.

I think, is the interest that

I think that the parent and the new

7

The classification, if any, that we have in

8

the case is, again, a classification of the spouse --

new spouse-parent relationship — and it would fall into

the same category, I believe, in this type of custody as

11

a custody by state, as in the Smith v. Organization cf

12

Foster Families.

13

consideration as we have in the Drummond case, which is

14

an adoption case.

I think that it’s the same type of

We’re not dealing with the marriage per se.

15
16

It’s not a relationship like we have in Loving.

17

court is not — the trial court is not making the same

18

type of presumptions.

19

making the same type of presumptions as in the Kramer v.

20

Kramer case, which is probably very close in factual, in

21

the factual basis.

I don’t believe that the court is

(Laughter.)

25

MR. HAWTREYi

Your Hcnor, it's the case cut of

440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

Iowa that's reported in 297 N.W. 2d 359 -- is the cne

2

I'm referring to.

3

(Laughter.)

4

HE. HAWTBEY;

In that case, I believe there

5

was an effort to exclude race entirely from the case,

6

but the judge then inserted it in a similar fashion as

7

in this case.

8
0

But the court, in the Kramer case, was making
presumptions.

I think that the court, in the Kramer

10

case, was making the same kind of presumptions that we

11

had in the Stanley v. Illinois case, where we were going

12

to decide — where Illinois decided that an unwed father

13

was presumptively incapable of having cr fathering cr

14

being the father of the child, and that he would have to

15

seek his child in seme other fashion.

16

I think, in addition to looking at what may

17

have been a classification, we have to look at what is

18

the action taken by the state court.

19

by the state court was a modiification.

20

The action taken

As counsel for the petitioner has pointed out,

21

we can go back in and review this again and again, I

22

guess from the time the child is age six till the child

23

is age 18, but unless there is a shewing,

24

believe at this point in time that there's been a

25

shewing of either ccrecion cr penalty, that the state

and I don't

action

2

permissible under the state law.

taken necessarily is anything other than what is

3

The Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing

4

case indicates to us that if we're — if we’re going to

6

have an allegation of racial discrimination, that there

6

has to be a showing of intent and purpose in the racial

7

discrimination or classification that I don't believe

8

has been shown in this particular case.
I think one of the elements necessary to show

9
10

an impermissible classifification lacks in that instance.
The other alternative view could be that the

11
12

classification is suspect, tut all of the custody cases

13

seem to take that type of classification or racial

14

classification out of the suspect nature and place them

15

in a framework of rational relationship between the

16

classification authorities.
Finally, again looking at the Kramer case and

17
18

quoting from its "It is best said, just as no

19

assumptions are automatically warranted based on gender

20

of parent or child, we believe no assumptions are

21

automatically warranted by racial identify."
