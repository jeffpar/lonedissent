MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. BORK:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
These cases are here on writ of certiorari from the

11
12

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

That Court

13

upheld a health standard promulgated by the Occupational

14

Safety and Health Administration, and the standard specifies

15

the maximum amount of respirable cotton dust that may be in

16

the air of any textile plant.

17

incidence of byssinosis, which is a respiratory condition

18

associated with cotton dust.

It is intended to reduce the

Petitioner in one case are -- American Textile

19

20

Manufacturers Association or ATMI, a trade association, and

21

12 manufacturer members.

22

the National Cotton Council, which represents all seven

23

segments of the cotton industry from farmers to textile manu­

24

facturing.

25

it requires textile manufacturers to reduce cotton dust within

Petitioners in the other case are

The standard is extraordinarily severe and costly;

4

1

four years to .2 milligrams per cubic meter of air in all

2

yarn manufacturing processes and to .75 milligrams per cubic

3

meter in all weaving processes.
Now this standard was arrived at by OSHA by

4
5

applying their carcinogen policy, which this Court remembers

6

from Benzene.

7

ure limit be set at the lowest feasible level.

8

that just two days ago OSHA rescinded its carcinogen policy.

9
10

The

QUESTION:
feasible in

11

Benzene case

requires that the expos­
It is ironic

Hr. Bork, how do you define the word

that statute?

MR. BORK:

Well in a variety of ways, Justice

12

Rehnquist.

13

to

14

an estimate of costs which is based upon substantial

15

It must then find what those costs mean to the industry,

16

what impact it will have upon the industry; how many jobs,

17

how much investment will be lost because of that cost.

18

In the first place, my first point will be that,

find a standard economically feasible, OSHA must have
evidence.

And finally, it has to have a legal criteria by

19

which it is able to state that the impact it finds is

20

economically feasible.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

And did you draw that definition from

the Congressional language or legislative
MR. BORK:

history?

From the Congressional language and also

24

it seems to me, Justice Rehnquist, that it is impossible to

25

say that something is feasible without knowing what it will

do to the industry.
it will do

to

And OSHA has made no finding here of what

the industry other than to say that some

undefined number of plants may close.
QUESTION:

Well, and that the industry as such

would not go -- not cease to exist?
MR. BORK:

The industry as such, Justice Stewart,

will not cease to exist is all they have said.

That finding

is thoroughly consistent with 90 percent of the industry
being left, or 50 percent of the industry being left, or 10
percent of the industry being left.

In fact, the literal

language that OSHA uses would be satisfied if there were a
single mil left.

That standard of the industry will continue

to exist is not a standard at all.
QUESTION:

But it is the one that OSHA applied?

MR. BORK:

That's the only one, that's right,

Justice Stewart.

And one of our contentions is that that

standard, if that is considered to be a standard, means that
nobody knows what OSHA is doing; judicial review is impossible,
and you have the completely

uncanalized

power over

industry that this Court found improper on the benefit side
of the act.

Here, they are claiming the same power through

22

their power to impose costs without limit, or without any

23

real limit.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well Mr. Bork, if while the Benzene case

was pending here, the Board had revoked its carcinogen policy,
6

1

as you say it now has, would we have remanded that Benzene

2

case for reconsideration?

3

MR. BORK:

I trust so.

4

QUESTION:

And are you suggesting that that should

5

be done here?

6
7

MR. BORK:

I'm suggesting that, but I have addi-

tional suggestions, Justice White --

8
9

Because --

QUESTION:

Yes, I know you do.

But this is a very

recent development, I take it?

10

MR. BORK:

Monday.

1 1

QUESTION:

Is there anything official --

12

MR. BORK:

I believe it's in the Federal Register

13

as of Monday, is it not ?

14

QUESTION:

Have the parties given us anything, Mr.

16

MR. BORK:

No, I just learned about it last night.

17

QUESTION:

I haven't heard it until you just

15

18
19

20

Bork?

mentioned it.
QUESTION:

Well could, I know you have other points

but it's possible that would be dispositive --

21

MR. BORK:

I think it is, Justice White.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Bork, can you hypothesize the cir-

23

cumstances in which a major industry, producing things we

24

regard as necessary, that is, the entire automobile industry

25

and the entire lumber industry, the entire cotton industry --

7

1

can you hypothesize any situation in which it could be simply

2

closed down and stopped, by operation of law?

3
4
5

MR. BORK: You mean

that it would be proper to do

it that way?
QUESTION:

Could it be done that way?

Could the

6

Congress of the United States, through its mechanisms such as

7

we have here, in effect say, no more automobiles shall be

8

produced because automobiles kill

9

and injure two million people a year, and therefore.

10

MR. BORK:

63,000

people a year

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that I

1 1

would agree that the Congress does have the power to do that.

12

There may be problems about compensation, but I think it has

13

the power to do that.

14

However, one thing is clear; that Congress in the

15

OSHA act did not intend just to shut down industries, because

16

they required that the standard be economically feasible.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Bork, the Chief Justice asked you

18

if the Congress could through its technicians, accomplish

19

this result?

20

had delegated to the executive branch the accomplishment

21

of these particular results.

22

would be any different if the question were phrased in those

23

terms or not.

24
25

My understanding of the act was that Congress

MR. BORK:

I don't know if your answer

Well, I think an additional problem arise s

5

Justice Rehnquist, and that is the problem that Congress did

t"

1

not delegate the power to destroy an industry because it

2

specifically required that economic feasibility be present.

3

So while Congress may have the raw constitutional power to

4

do that, it is perfectly clear that in this statute it has not

5

done that.
QUESTION:

6

Well, one of your points is that there

7

was an overdelegation, in the sense that it's -- a delegation

8

without any standards, isn't it?
MR. BORK:

9

That is quite correct, Justice White.

10

But it is more than that, because it is a constitutional

11

point in that sense.

12

QUESTION:

Right.

13

MR. BORK:

But it is also a statutory point, so

15

QUESTION:

Right.

16

MR. BORK:

-- I think those persons who do not

14

that --

17

think that the delegation doctrine remains a part of consti­

18

tutional law would nevertheless wish to reverse here, for a

19

wholly inadequate set of findings about economic feasibility.

20

One simply cannot judge economic feasibility in any way from

21

the record OSHA has made.
QUESTION:

22
23

The statutory word is feasible, isn't

it?

24

MR. BORK: Pardon me?

25

QUESTION:

The statutory word is feasible, I mean,
9

1

not economically feasible?
MR. BORK:

2

That is correct.

That is correct.

Every

3

body who has looked at it, every Court who has looked at it

4

has accepted the contention that feasibility requires both

5

technological feasibility and economic feasibility.

6

QUESTION:

And maybe some other kind of feasibility.

7

MR. BORK:

Perhaps so.

8

QUESTION:

And along with the executives, along

9

with OSHA, they think it includes economic -MR. BORK:

10
1 1

Yes they do -- no, OSHA does not contend

that economic feasibility is not a requirement.
QUESTION:

Right.

14

MR. BORK:

That is correct, Justice Stewart.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Bork, could I be sure I understand

12
13

But the statutory standard is

feasible.

16

your suggestion about the revocation of -- OSHA's carcinogen

17

policy?

18

we're dealing with here, is it?

19

I didn't understand -- this is not a carcinogen that

MR. BORK:

That's why I find it ironic that OSHA

20

continues to insist upon a standard arrived upon the carcino­

21

gen policy for cotton dust which is not a carcinogen.

22
23

QUESTION:

Well, but did they expressly rely on the

carcinogen policy here, or do you think their reasoning was -

24

MR. BORK:

As I understand it --

25

QUESTION:

--

comparable to that used in the other
10

1

cases ?

2

MR.

BORK:

It was certainly identical, not just

3

comparable, Justice Stevens.

4

relied upon it.

5

And I think they expressly

Was the lead case in this same Court of

policy was amended because of the Benzene case, and they said
that the -- that lowest, that carcinogen policy requiring
the lowest feasible level was inconsistent with the act.

would suppose this is too.

Yes .
Was that like this, a non-cancer-pro-

Or was it a cancer-producing agent?
BORK:

QUESTION:

No,

it is not a carcinogen.

Wasn't the reason for revoking the car-

cinogen policy, at least as applied in cases like Benzene, was
the failure to make a finding that was made in this case,
namely that there was a significant risk.
really affect this case?

11

So does revocation

MR. BORK:

1

2

Well, I don't think the -- I'll come to

that, I don't think the significant risk -QUESTION:

3

You don't contest the fact there was sucl

4

a -- the finding required by Benzene was made here, I don't

5

think you dispute that?

6

MR. BORK:

That first finding was, yes.

7

QUESTION:

Yes, and you don't challenge it as being

8

adequately supported by the record?
MR. BORK:

9

Well there is a significant risk in

10

cotton dust, it's a question of at what

11

controls that risk disappears, is very much before us.
But my first point I have, --

12

level and with what

really want to

13

argue two propositions.

The first one is economic feasibility

14

And as to that, my point is that three things are required.

15

As I said, an estimate of costs based upon substantial evi­

16

dence.

17

based upon no evidence, it is pure conjecture.

18

two elements of economic feasibility aren't even present here,

19

and that is, what do those costs mean for the industry, how

20

much of this industry is going to be destroyed.

21

even addressed here, except to say the whole industry won't

22

be destroyed.

23

no policy judgment, no articulated policy judgment, nothing

24

as to why whatever percentage of the industry is going to be

25

destroyed should nevertheless be considered a feasible policy.

Our point here is that the estimate of costs is
But the second

That isn't

And thirdly, there is no criteria of any sort;

12

1

So that, two of the three elements which are inherent and

2

inevitable

3

aren't present here, and that fact alone, I think, requires

4

reversal.

5

to support the cost for the bases , so that we have economic

6

feasibility requiring three elements, not one of which is

7

present in this case.

8

quite understandably, attempts to obscure this point which is

9

present in our main brief, by speaking as if we are only

in

any finding of economic feasibility simply

Additionally, there is no substantial evidence

And the government's brief I think,

10

arguing about the substantial evidence

11

cost estimate.

12

arguing that the other two elements which are required for

13

any sensible judgment of economic feasibility aren't even

14

addressed at this point.

15

supporting

We are not only arguing that.

QUESTION:

We are also

Well, Mr. Bork, none of this, I gather,

16

as you've now stated, involves an argument that a cost

17

benefit analysis was obtained?

18

the

MR. BORK:

That is my second proposition, Justice

20

QUESTION:

That's your second point.

21

MR. BORK:

And these --

22

QUESTION:

Is that under the feasibility or under

the reasonably necessary?

24

MR. BORK:

I think it's under both, Justice Brennan.

25

QUESTION:

Under both.
13

1

MR. BORK:

Under both sections of the statute.

2

But I want to stress that these two propositions are logically

3

independent.

4

in and of itself justify reversal, quite aside from whether

5

there was any requirement, which we contend there is,

6

there be a reasonable relationship between costs and benefits.

The argument about economic feasibility would

QUESTION:

that

And were these points presented this

way to the Court of Appeals?
MR. BORK:

The Court of Appeals, the cost-benefit

10

point was presented and the finding of economic feasibility

11

was attacked, yes.

18

QUESTION:

But in these terms, in the terms that

you are now putting --- with the three elements?
MR. BORK:

I don't think it was that drawn out, in

quite that sharp a form.
QUESTION:

You're inferring that the Court of Appeal^

dealt with these particular points?
MR. BORK:

No.

The Court of Appeals simply accepted

19

the idea that if -- which was challenged -- that if the whole

20

industry was not destroyed, that was sufficient.

21

of Appeals articulated that standing.

22

The Court

point, that the agency is claiming an unfettered power -QUESTION:

figure is 25 percent and supposing 25 percent of the firms

would go out of business but the remaining 75 percent would

MR. BORK:

How much of the industry must be destroyec
Supposing that -- say the.

Would that be feasible

Well, in the first place, Justice Stevens

I am not advancing any standard because I am not in a posi­
tion to do so.

1 1

These things have never been addressed --

QUESTION:

No, but you are advancing a proposition

12

:hat there must be measurement of the percentage of the indus­

13

try destroyed.

14

that to mean destroying existing firms or a portion of the

15

total output?

16

What do you mean by destroying industry, is

MR. BORK:

Oh, I think it means both.

For example,

17

if -- it may be that if there is a section of the country

18

where all of the firms would be destroyed with drastic effects

19

upon employment and so forth and so on, that might be con­

20

sidered not feasible, even

21

to a different section of the country.

wish to settle that.

MR. BORK:

QUESTION:

Because certainly there's no Congress­

ional guidance on this precise point.
MR. BORK:

No, that’s true.

I think the -- while

we're talking about practical concerns and so forth -- I
think it would be a common law development when OSHA began
to give the reasons why it found a certain level of destruction
feasible.

The Courts could then look at it and we would begin

to get some rationality into OSHA's processes and we would
know what they were doing.

18
19

MR. BORK:

as it follows these three criteria?

1 1

13

It's just not there.

whatever approach to the word feasible makes sense, as long

QUESTION:

QUESTION: Would you say OSHA is free to pick

Pardon me?

not prepared ;to spell out all of the conditions under which --

5

6

MR. BORK:

And not least, that would make OSHA politically
accountable to Congress, because Congress would know then
what price we are paying for this kind of thing. So I
think it is a large function of this Court to introduce
political acoountability into processes, governmental pro­
cesses, which

lack

them.

And this one certainly lacks

them.
QUESTION:

Let me pursue the hypothetical question

1

I put to you earlier, Mr. Bork.

example, unless they can demonstrate that all negative health

4

factors were eliminated?

5

statute?

6

MR. BORK:

In your view, would Congress
to bar cigarettes, for

Could Congress do that itself via

In my opinion, you have chosen the

7

example, Mr. Chief Justice, that pains me a great deal, but

8

I think they could.

9

QUESTION:

Second question:

could they delegate

10

that, by a structure somewhat like the usual pattern of

11

creating a commission like OSHA, could they delegate that

12

to a commission on tobacco hazards?

13

MR. BORK:

I think, again, Mr. Chief Justice, the

14

answer is yes they could, if they told the agency what it

15

was to consider in arriving at the conclusion whether or not

16
17

cigarettes were to be banned.
QUESTION:

That is, do you mean by that if the

18

commission, after hearings, made findings that it had this

19

definite health hazard factor, carcinogen-producing elements,

20

then the commission could --

21

22
23

MR. BORK:

I think so, if it's a canalized, struc­

tured delegation, so the commission isn't just roaming free.
QUESTION:

And it would have nothing to do with --

24

or Congress would not be limited by the fact that this would

25

put a great many people out of business?
17

HR. BORK:

1

No, Congress would not be, nor would

2

OSHA, if they had been delegated the task. But they were

3

delegated the task to do it to the extent that it is feasible,

4

which we all, I think agree that it means economically

5

feasible, and given that, I think they have to make the

6

findings that go to feasibility.

7

Now the other point --

8

QUESTION:

9
10

And they have not.

Mr. Bork, before you proceed, does OSHA

agree with your assertion that it has authority, under the
act, to put 50 percent of a major industry out of business?
MR. BORK:

11

Justice Powell, the difficulty is that

12

OSHA has never addressed what it's authority is.

13

well, I don't know -QUESTION:

14
15

have before us?

Are OSHA's findings in the papers that we

I couldn't locate them.

MR. BORK:

16

I think --

OSHA's findings are simply that the

17

entire industry will not be destroyed or industry as a whole

18

will not be destroyed, that's all they said.
QUESTION:

19

And I'm sure the Solicitor General will

20

respond to my question, but one of the examples you gave was

21

that --I understood it, that under the standard before us

22

in this case 90 percent of the industry could be put out of

23

business and OSHA

24

priate .

25

MR. BORK:

would still claim the standard was appro­

OSHA could still claim, under that form
18

1

of words.

2

a large part of OSHA's argument in its brief is that they

3

don't really need to state a standard because they are very

4

reasonable and prudent people.

5

argues, you can certainly trust us because we're reasonable

6

and we're careful.

7

I don't know what OSHA would do in that case.

QUESTION:

And

And in effect, the brief

But that's the -Did OSHA make the sort of findings of

8

fact that we expect from a trial court, and if so, where are

9

they?

10

MR. BORK:

I can't find them, Justice Powell.

11

In a way, I think they have to, to have a rational
process that can be reviewed by anybody.

The only thing

they have tried to do, is state that they have found particu­
lar costs.

I think I will have to provide that subject in

view of the time, because if a careful look is taken at their
19

cost estimates it will be found that they rest upon nothing.

For example, in the spinning process, which is one

Some people have a little trouble breathing throudh
So you have to try it on the

One more point about costs which is simply that,

12

I think it is quite clear that less cotton is going to be

13

manufactured as a result of this standard.

14

cotton production has been dropping every year since the

15

standard was announced.

16

look at the costs imposed, for example, upon cotton farmers;

17

there are 160,000 cotton farmers many of whom are no longer

18

going to growing cotton and OSHA just simply ignored all of

19

those costs in its standard and didn't even address them.

20

Which, I think, is also improper.

In fact, the

And OSHA decided it did not have to

21

But I'd like to turn to the second proposition now,

22

which is the question of whether there has to be a reasonable

23

relationship between costs and benefit.

24

25

QUESTION:

Before you go on to that, Mr. Bork, is

there anything in this record that would indicate that with
21

1

dropping domestic production of cotton and cotton products --

2

MR. BORK:

The National Cotton -- I'm sorry.

3

QUESTION:

-- that there are imports that are taking

4

up the slack?
MR. BORK:

5

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

The

6

National Cotton Council put in the evidence on what would

7

happen to cotton farmers, it put in the evidence upon the

8

decline of domestic cotton production which I think is about

9

2.5 percent a year for the last four years, and of course, the

10

import of domestic, foreign textiles, cotton-made textiles,

11

has been increasing and may increase at 6 to 7 percent a

12

year, even under the restrictive trade agreements.
QUESTION:

13

Anything to prevent Congress from, or

14

OSHA, from providing that no imports would be permitted in

15

this country unless the sources complied with OSHA's standards?

MR. BORK:

MR. BORK:

Well, I addressed your question on the

assumption that Congress has the raw power to try it.

don't think it's a very practical effort.

MR. BORK:

But on the relation­

3

to consider it, because --

QUESTION:

Excuse me for interrupting you again,

5

Mr. Bork, wd're not giving you much chance, I'm afraid.

6

in connection with your argument, I gather what you're now

7

addressing is a little different than the costs discussion

8

you've been giving us as to unfeasibility --

9

MR. BORK:

It's entirely different.

-- it is independent, isn't it?

That's right.

Well, yet, what we're concerned with here,

I gather, is what the relationship is of cost to benefit,

MR. BORK:

Well, that's not a benefit, unless it

3

provides additional protection to workers.

4

QUESTION:

From this -- cost question?

5

MR. BORK:

That's right, and here I think the

6

real case to be decided -- the reason I think this is a case

7

that's almost ideal for this kind of discussion, is that

8

byssinosis is not a carcinogen, it develops slowly, it can

9

be caught by a variety of tests long before it gets to the

10

irreversible stage, so that I think there is no benefit, but

11

I don't have to

12

reducing the PEL from .5 to .2 when you have a medical

13

surveillance plan which catches these things and the workers

14

can be transferred or put in respirators.

15

say that -- I think there's no benefit, to

But at least OSHA should have addressed the

16

question, whether moving from -- down from .5 to .2

17

is a reduction in dust levels, I mean, that's our proposal,

18

whether coming down from .5 to .2 with a medical surveillance

19

plan which OSHA itself has said these tests would insure that

20

any significant change from the baseline determination will

21

become apparent before material impairment occurs.

22

QUESTION:

-- .5

Well even if you are right, where in the

23

statute is the requirement that OSHA do what you're now

24

suggesting OSHA should have done?

25

MR. BORK:

I think this comes under the reasonably
24

1

necessary language, and under the requirement of feasibility,

2

and indeed, it comes I think from the language that OSHA's

3

counsel seem to think goes the other way, which is no material

4

impairment of health to the extent feasible.

5

standard about, that isn't a criteria about a single health

hazard, that is the worker and the total amount of risks he

faces in the marketplace, and you can't come close or as

close as is possible -QUESTION:

9

That isn't a

Well, I guess we'd all be better off if

10

Congress had said in express terms that OSHA should have done

11

a cost benefit-analysis. What kind do you suggest?
MR. BORK:

12

Justice Brennan, I would stress that I'm

13

not suggesting a computer or a slide rule and a straight weigh

ing.

15

to state what range it is dealing with in cost-benefits

16

I think OSHA should be allowed -- required, is required

QUESTION:

Well are we going to -- if they must do

17

a cost-benefit analysis, are we not going to have to define

18

what we mean by cost-benefit analysis?

19

MR. BORK:

In the sense that you want OSHA to

20

articulate the -- because they have never done it, the addi­

21

tional benefits from .5 with medical surveillance to .2 with

22

medical surveillance, and I think there are no additional

23

benefits. But they've never articulated it if there are any.

24
25

And I don't think this is reading something into the
statute in any heroic fashion, Justice Brennan, because this
25

1

is a less heroic reading of the statute than, for example,

2

reading the rule of reason was into the Sherman Act, whose

3

text simply doesn't allow the rule of reason.

4

to make that a rational and useful statute, rather than a

5

wholly destructive statute, this Court read the rule of reason

6

in it.

7

allows and indeed, compells, the finding that -- and I want

8

to stress this, OSHA says in its brief, that it is comparing

9

all these factors.

But in order

So, here, I think the text of this statute easily

So it's not resisting thinking about cost-

benefit.

benefit analyses they do, what they are resisting is disclosing

their thought processes.

HR. BORK:

That's right.

So that anybody, Justice

15

Marshall, can review it, or find out what they're talking

16

about, or so that Congress can find out what they're talking

17

about and what kind of -QUESTION:

Mr. Bork, do you think they can do it in

meaningful way without putting a value on
MR. BORK:

human life?

Certainly, Justice Stevens.

In the first

21

place, I would stress that human life is not at stake in this

22

case, because at the levels we're talking about and the medicaL

23

surveillance we're talking about, this stuff can be caught

24

before it becomes irreversible and human life is not at stake

25

in this case, nor is material impairment of health at stake
26

1

in this case.

2

QUESTION:

Well, would it not have to put a

3

dollar value on the irreversible stage of the disease at

least?

MR. BORK:

Not in this case, Justice Stevens, and

6

not in most cases, I think.

nobody expects that.

Of course, the alternative

One final question, if I may, Mr. Bork.

Do you contend that this is a toxic substance case under
Section 6, or whatever the number is, do you contend there is
any difference in the cost-benefit analysis in a toxic sub­
stance case than in any other standards?

10
1 1

But I don't think we're asking any­

MR. BORK:

No, I don't think so, in that sense.

Because this is not, there are toxic substances that produce
harm that can't be reversed.

I think that's a very different

case, than this case where, despite some confusions upon the
topic -QUESTION:

Well, we've got to decide which section

of the statute we're working with, and Section 6, where the
word feasibility is found, is in the toxic substance section.
Do you -- first of all, do you agree that that's the appro­
priate section for purposes of statutory analysis?
MR. BORK:

I think --

QUESTION:

Assuming it's a toxic substance.

MR. BORK:

I think Section 6

is the appropriate

section, but I think all standards are also governed by

It seems to me that both 3.8 and --

QUESTION:

5

But you can't rely on both if it's not

6

a toxic substance case, and that's why it seems to me we've

7

got to think through the question whether the rule is dif­

8

ferent for a toxic substance than it is for a non-toxic

9

substance.

10

MR. BORK:

Well, we agree it is a toxic substance.

1 1

And it seems to me that if one wants to discuss 6(b)(5)

12

alone, that the requirement of a cost-benefit comparison, and

13

articulation of reasons, is to be found in 6(b)(5).

14

QUESTION:

Well no, my point is somewhat different.

15

My point is, when one is confronted with a non-toxic sub­

16

stance and therefore doesn't have the benefit of the language

17

in 6(b)(5), is there also a cost-benefit requirement.

18

if so, that requirement is found independently of the feas­

19

ibility language.

20

MR. BORK:

And

That's right, I think it would be

21

found, Justice Stevens, in the reasonably necessary language

22

of the section.

QUESTION:

If that's enough, then you can't really

requires cost-benefit analysis for all standards, then we

don't even have to look at the feasibility language.

7

MR. BORK:

That's right.

8

QUESTION:

On the other hand, if you must look at

9

the feasibility language in order to justify or to support

10

your argument that cost-benefit is appropriate, then you do

1 1

not require cost-benefit in non-toxic substance cases, which

12

would be somewhat ironic, because that would mean that you

from 6(b)(5) to the extent feasible.

I don't think it's very useful here to replay

the evidentiary disputes that the Secretary resolved and that

2

the Court of Appeals found were supported by substantial

evidence.
The respirators are not feasible, the record quite

Secondly, the industry's approach in this

case, and certainly the basis for the so-called ATMI alter­

were no more damaging than the common cold.

incorrect.

That's absolutely

There was substantial evidence in the record of

material health risk even at low levels of byssinosis, and

11

more important, the Secretary found that it's a continuum of

that byssinosis is a continuum of disease, but it doesn't

Is it possible to tell from OSHA's

be, to mean?

MR. GELLER:

Yes, well, the Secretary has always

taken the position --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. GELLER:

Is it something more than affordable?
It means economically affordable by

22

the industry as a whole, not by every individual employer in

23

the industry.

24
25

QUESTION:

So what --just as long as it's affordable

by the industry as a whole?
34

1

MR. GELLER:

That's right. That it won't materially

2

impair the industry's financial condition, industry will be

3

able to maintain long-term

And here, the Secretary found, the industry as a whole will

not be threatened by the capital requirements of the regula­

6

tion, that's page 27378.

QUESTION:

competitiveness and profit levels.

Well, do you mean by that, that if the

8

record showed that compliance would increase the cost of

9

cotton to the ultimate consumer by 500 percent, that then we

10

could go ahead?

11

MR. GELLER:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

No, because in that situation -You didn't put any limit on the economic

feasibility in your earlier statement.
MR. GELLER:

if

people would no longer buy cotton, the industry would go out

MR. GELLER:

Well the Secretary has the burden of

proving economic feasibility, he does -- he does analyses,

would be a decrease in demand for cotton of only about 1 or 2

costs could rise to keep the same profit levels, only --

14

phrase that the Secretary has the burden of proving economic

15

feasibility, as I recall, the statute simply says if feasible,

16

doesn't it?

17
18

MR. GELLER:

21

Feasibility though,

is a requirement before Section 6(b)(5) --

19

20

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Well why do you read the word economic

i nto it?
MR. GELLER:

Well, I think that I agree with

22

Professor Bork and certainly with the lower court, that

23

Section 6(b)(5) has construed the word feasible to mean both

24

technologically and economically feasible.

25

think Congress meant.

That's what we

That's -- in other statutes, such as
36

1

the Clean Air Act which was passed the same week as the

2

Occupational Safety and Health Act, Congress specifically

3

said economically and technologically feasible, and in this

4

statute, that's --

5

QUESTION:

But wouldn't that be almost an argument

6

against your position, if Congress the same week, when using

7

the word feasible, had modified it with the words economic anc

8

technologically, and in this statute it simply said if

9

feasible --

10

MR. GELLER:

Well I don’t think, Congress doesn't

1 1

act in computer-like fashion, but I think that when in the

12

same week they used the word feasible and define it to mean

13

both economic and technological feasibility, that that's what

14

they mean when they -- the same week, used the word feasible

15

without the modifiers.

16

There's no suggestion in very lengthy legislative

17

history, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that they meant anything

18

other than economic or technological feasibility.

19

QUESTION:

Incidentally, Mr. Geller, you just men­

20

tioned pass the cost on to the consumer, was there any

21

finding to that effect?

22

MR. GELLER:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, there were substantial -Well, I know there was an extreme assump­

24

25

MR. GELLER:

There was testimony by experts in the

No well, I'm asking, what finding other

than the expression extreme assumption?
MR. GELLER:

No, no, no.

There were express find­

6

ings in this case, Mr. Justice Brennan, in cent per profit

7

cent, how much each garment would go up, these are all of

8

course speculations, but informed ones, OSHA did not talk in

9

vague generalities.

10

The preamble to this standard takes up some 40 or

11

50 pages of three column^ small type in the Federal Register,

12

justifying every single finding that the Secretary made, and

13

the Court of Appeals took 100 pages analyzing the record very

14

carefully to conclude that the Secretary's findings as regard

15

to these Petitioners were supported by substantial evidence.

16

The --

anyway, I just want to mention another one

17

of the misstatements I think that was made, because I think

18

it's important, the Secretary does not engage in the cost-

19

benefit analysis under Section 6(g), he sets priorities, by

20

statute he sets priorities.

21

sophistication for the Secretary to realize that the number

22

one priority facing the textile industry in terms of health

23

was cotton dust.

25

And it didn't take very much

QUESTION:

Well, you instinctively do, as Professor

Bork suggested.

Every decision that every person or institu­

MR. GELLER:

MR. GELLER:

a

Not with the same set of -Even in the setting of priorities.
Yes, but not, I don't think, Mr.

7

Justice Stewart, with the same sort of mathematical precision

8

that these Petitioners are going to require --

QUESTION:

Whether or not you're going to play an

10

extra rubber of bridge, you weigh the pleasure of playing an

1 1

extra rubber of bridge with the loss of sleep that's going to

be incurred.

13

decision, is it not?

14

Every decision that's made is a cost-benefit
Every rational decision?

MR. GELLER:

Every rational decision takes into

15

account costs and benefits, perhaps, but it doesn't weigh

16

them the way the Petitioners suggest the Secretary has to

17

weigh them in some sort of fine balance in this case.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

In the setting of priorities, it's a

cost-benefit decision.
MR. GELLER:

And the Secretary does that under

21

Section 6(g), and therefore there's no reason to think that

22

when the standard is issued, that under Section 6(g) and under

23

Section 6(b)(5), and under Section 3(8) , that it's going to be

24

irrational.

25

Let me also mention --

QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, Mr. Bork mentioned the fact
39

that there were no findings and I can't find any findings.

Now will you tell me where they are?

Secretary found that there was a concentration process going

on in this industry, wholly regardless of health standards,

20

not have been thought to have any cost-benefit analysis in

section, it was in the statute in precisely the same form it

exists, today from the very beginning, and yet, Senators

24

Dominick and Senator Javits and others were quite concerned

25

during the latter stages of the legislative history, that

That is, that Section 3(8) could

48

1

the statute might require absolute hell for spending a lot

2

of money for things that weren't worth it, and they restruc­

3

tured Section 6(b)(5) to take account of that, by adding the

4

feasibility language and material health language and all the

5

rest, there would have been no reason for them to have engagec

6

in that discussion if anybody thought that a cost-benefit

7

analysis was already in the reasonably necessary or appropriat e

phrase in Section 3(8). But nobody suggested that, during a

that's why we think it's totally --

The discussion was whether this was some

that insofar as achieving the costs necessary to achieve the

QUESTION:

What is your definition of the word

3
4

if feasible, in the statute?
MR. COHEN:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the words of

5

the statute are to the extent feasible, there's a bit of

6

deja vu in this, because we do this together in the Benzene

7

case, our -- my answer then and my answer today, as further

8

enlightened by this Court's decision in Benzene, is that

9

the Congress of the United States was not seeking to impose

10

impossible, impossible health -- a solution that would be

1 1

impossible as far as industry would be concerned, and that

12

impossibility has been translated into two dimensions.

13

one, that it must be achievable in the sense that there is

14

the technology and work place practices available, so-called

15

technologically feasible.

which has also been imported into the statute, is in essence

23

MR. COHEN:

You mean yet.
Well, I thought the question, Mr.

24

Justice Marshall, was does the origin of the importing come

25

out of this Court?

I think the answer to that is no, I think
51

1

this Court properly concluded that the legislative history

2

as reflected most precisely by Senator Dominick, the leading

3

spokesman for the Nixon Administration as this bill was

4

passing through the halls of Congress, who made it very clear

5

that what he was most concerned about -- and this then became

6

the consensus of the Senatorial concern, was that in the name

7

of providing safety and health what would happen would be

8

that you would drive industries as a whole out of business

9

and ban occupations as a whole in the course of that process .

10

And it was that concern, whether one wants to then

1 1

put in terms the word economic feasibility which I am per­

12

fectly comfortable with and all the reviewing Courts have

13

used, and this Court --

MR. COHEN:

And OSHA, and OSHA.
And OSHA, yes.
And that feasible includes economically

feasible, everybody agrees?
MR. COHEN:

Yes, everybody agrees there.

The

19

question, among the questions presented here is in order for

20

something to be feasible, must this magical cost-benefit

21

analysis be done, we of course reject that argument.

22

reject it because we say, number one, it's not there on the

23

face of the statute, and number two, it is not there in the

legislative history.

23

MR. COHEN:

Yes.

24

QUESTION:

What do you think that it doesn't require?

25

MR. COHEN:

It doesn't require, after the Secretary
53

1

has laid the -- has done the following:

2

determination, made a threshold determination that we have a

3

significant risk of health involved, and that that risk can,

4

through a variety of procedures, be dramatically reduced.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. COHEN:

has met the threshold

Right.
That the Secretary must select the

7

most protective way to achieve that result, consistent to

8

the constraint or consistent with a constraint and the

9

constraint is that it must be feasible, it must be technolog­

10

ically achieveable and it must be feasible in the economic

1 1

sense, namely, that as a result of complying with this

12

standard industry as a whole's financial viability will not

13

be challenged.

14

our position is the Secretary's obligations are over and the

15

standard is entitled to --

16

And that, at that point, Mr. Justice White,

QUESTION:

Well, I think Mr. Justice Stewart may

17

have suggested before that -- well, isn't that a cost-

18

benefit judgment in itself?

19

MR. COHEN:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. COHEN:

23

QUESTION:

25

Now --

That the benefits that you're going to

get, are worth whatever --

22

24

All right.

I think you are precisely correct.
-- are worth whatever Impact there is

on the industry?
MR. COHEN:

Yes, we believe you are precisely
54

1

correct in this sense.

2

was, in effect, do its own "cost-benefit analysis".

3

made the determination --

4

QUESTION:

We believe that what Congress did
Congress

Well I know, but the Secretary has too.

5

You've -- I suppose, he sets these levels after having

6

concluded that the impact on the industry isn't so great

7

that he should set a higher standard.

8

MR. COHEN:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

MR. COHEN:

Is that right or not?
That's what the Secretary has said,

that's what we believe satisfies the statute --

12
13

Well if you -- on your terms --

QUESTION:

Well, then the answer to my question is

yes, isn't it?

14

MR. COHEN:

Well I have a sense of responsibility.

15

I don't want to mislead you into thinking the other side

16

agrees that that's a cost-benefit analysis.

17

is a cost-benefit analysis, in the sense that that's all

18

the Congress was concerned --

19

QUESTION:

20

23
24

25

At least you think that's all the cost-

benefit analysis the statute requires?

21

22

We think that

MR. COHEN:

Exactly.

And that is the policy judg-

ment -QUESTION:

And in any event it does not require any

quantifying in dollar terms, of the benefits?
MR. COHEN: Absolutely.
55

1

2
3

QUESTION:

It may, on the cost side, but not on

the benefit side.
MR. COHEN:

Absolutely.

And I want to just carry

4

that point one step forward, Mr. Justice Brennan.

If you --

5

reading the industry position knowing as they come before the

6

Court and tell you, that it doesn't require valuing human

7

life, there's only one way to get away from that proposition

8

and they try to get away with it by saying what the Secretary

9

should be doing

in setting a standard for one toxic sub­

10

stance, is to compare what the risk is going to be for other

1 1

potential hazards, what the technological feasibility will

12

be for all of those other hazards, what the cost of compliance

13

will be for all of those hazards, and in that nice, simple,

14

little package, says the ATMI, we have offered a "feasible

15

solution" to ways this statute should be interpreted.

16

that in our judgment, in effect, would be asking the Secre­

17

tary of Labor, in the name of doing something, to do every­

18

thing, he would have to inventory the entire list of every

19

single potential toxic substance.

20

QUESTION:

Now

Mr. Cohen, I take it it's undisputed

21

that Congress, under its Commerce power, could flatly ban

22

child labor?

23

ban child labor to the extent it is feasible, and delegate to

24

OSHA the promulgation of regulations for banning it.

25

you think OSHA would have to do?

Supposing Congress passed a statute saying we

56

What do

MR. COHEN:

1

I think -- I don't think, I want to

2

emphasize this, I don't think we're anywhere near that in this

3

case.

4

discuss ion and rhetoric that's gone back and forth here in

5

Court today, and our brief spells out what that discussion

6

was and what those concerns were.

7

hypothetical, but let me stay with the concerns.

We have much clearer guidance from Congress than the

Now I know we've got a

8

The concern was that small employers particularly,

9

were not devoting the necessary capital investments in order

10

to provide safe and healthy work places.

11

this was a problem.

12

in the context of the cotton dust case.

13

we are going to insist on a uniform, nationwide approach;

14

we're going to compel

15

standards because if we don't go that way we're never going

16

to get it, the ultimate protection that this statute is all

17

about.

18

Congress understood

This is not a problem that's just emerged
And Congress said,

each and every employer to meet these

Congress went further.

They also understood, and

19

there's been discussions here of who would go out of business?

20

Well we're way removed from that problem in this case.

21

a matter of fact, in the Court of Appeals, the Court of

22

Appeals' opinion says that the American Textile Manufacturing

23

Industry concedes that at 550 million dollars there's no

24

economic feasibility problem insofar as the entire industry

25

as a whole is concerned.

As

But getting back to my point, Mr.
57

1

Justice Rehnquist -QUESTION:

2
3

Well I thought it was my question that

you were trying to get back to.
MR. COHEN: Yes.

4

I am trying to.

What I guess I'm

5

saying is that I'm not sure that I know what precise tools

6

would be brought to bear to deal with the child labor.

7

saying that the tools are there to deal with it, based on

8

the legislative history of this statute.

9

ished that precise point.

And it was.

I am

And I hadn't fin­
Not only was the

10

judgment uniform, nationwide, small employers, but there is

1 1

a recognition that this would well or might well have a

12

severe impact on small employers.

13

comes out of the blue; that was a major subject of concern.

14

Senator Dominick repeated that concern, but what was the

15

solution?

16

employer? No.

17

as to workers in those plants?

18

Section 28, will address this in terms of a small business

19

loan proposition.

20

driven out of business needs the economic wherewithal to

21

be able to comply, we will afford that program.

22

incidentally, to the program that this Court addressed --

23

That was not something that

Was it to carve out or exempt the small marginal
Was it to dilute the protection of the statute
No.

What Congress said, in

If an employer who would otherwise be

QUESTION:

Very similar,

Mr. Cohen, you keep saying that the

24

problem is and the complaint of Petitioner is that OSHA didn't

25

go through this.

I thought the complaint was OSHA hasn't yet
58

1

told anybody what they did?

Now isn't that the complaint the

2

Petitioners made, is that you can do anything -- that you can

3

find out whether they did right or wrong.

4

MR. COHEN:

Mr. Justice Marshall --

5

QUESTION:

Is that their position?

6

MR. COHEN:

That's their position.

We and the

7

Solicitor General have each responded to that proposition.

8

What we have said, basically, is insofar as economic feas­

9

ibility is concerned, that the aggregate amount of money,

10

the 550 million dollars which the Secretary found wasn't a

11

dream, it was a finding.

The Secretary -How many business would be put --- of Labor found one thing, one

precise thing on this point.
QUESTION:

He said industry --

Did they find any figures as to how many

would go out of business?
MR. COHEN:

He said although some marginal employers

21

although some marginal employers might choose to go out of

22

business rather than comply, -- I'm reading to you now from

23

the Federal Register 27378, column 2.

MR. COHEN:

Where does it say how many?

Isn't that a conclusion?
Well, it was based on his analysis of

We take his word.

Of course, and we take his word and your

That's the answer.
MR. COHEN:

My red light is up.

I would just like

22

to say as I leave the podium, that we have addressed in detail,

the comments of Textile Manufacturing Institute as to the

24

respirator, as to their so-called alternative, and we have

explained why it does not provide the health protection
