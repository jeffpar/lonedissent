ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. HALL, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. HALL:

7

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This is a case which presents the question of

9

10

Sanchez.

Mr. Hall, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

4

8

We’ll hear arguments

whether Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which is 42 U.S.C.

11

1973c, requires the pre-clearance of a county reapportion­

12

ment plan which was prepared after a trial at the Court's

13

direction, after a previous plan had been invalidated, and

14

after an evidentiary hearing upon the use of the proposed

15

plan.

16

declared by the trial court to be one which should be

17

used for the 1980 elections.

18

brought alleging an existing districting plan for four

19

commissioners' precincts of Kleberg County to be uncon­

20

stitutional first because the existing plan diluted the vote

21

of the Mexican-American residents of the County, and

22

secondly because it violated the one-man-one-vote principle

23

of the Constitution.

24

25

And when the plan that was newly completed

was

The original lawsuit was

The trial of the case was devoted primarily to the
first question; that is, whether the existing plan diluted
3

1

the voting strength of Mexican-American residents.

2

conclusion of the trial the trial court held that there

3

had been no dilution of Mexican-American voting strength

4

but that there was a violation of the one-man-one-vote

5

principle and ordered that the County prepare a new plan

6

and submit it to the Court for consideration.

7

court set a hearing date on the new plan, the parties

8

appeared at that time -- and incidentally, this was a

9

class action brought by Mexican-American residents of

10
1 1

At the

The trial

Kleberg County.
At the evidentiary hearing on the plan, the trial

12

court heard evidence as to the statistical results and

13

also heard questions with respect to the effect of the

14

new plan on the voting strength of Mexican-Americans ,. how

15

Mexican-American residents and voters had been affected by

16

the particular plan that was presented.

17

actually prepared by a professor from Texas A & I University,

18

whose sole objective was to achieve an equality in number

19

between the four precincts.

20

one occasion, that the County would prefer that a boundary

21

line be withdrawn to include the courthouse in Commissioners'

22

precinct number 1, he was also asked to try to maintain the

23

integrity of existing voting or election precincts , rather

24

than to divide them up.

25

he did have to divide or split a number of voting precincts.

The plan was

He was instructed however, on

He accomplished all this, although

4

1

And as we have pointed out in our brief, this

2

is an action which could only be taken by the Commissioners'

3

Court in July or August of a given year and it was not

4

done in the Texas Court -- it was not done in that time-

5

period and the Texas courts have held that a Commissioners'

6

Court, itself, is absolutely precluded from making a

7

division of Commissioners' precincts other than at the

8

stated time, and that is --

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Your opposition disagrees with that,

don't they?
MR. HALL:

I know they do, Your Honor, but I

12

disagree with my opposition, because I think that the

13

case of Wilson v. Weller makes it very clear, both

14

in its holding and its distinguishing of another

15

Texas Supreme Court case that where in fact election pre­

16

cincts -- and we're not talking about Commissioners'

17

precincts at this point, we're talking about election pre­

18

cincts, when

19

daries are re-drawn -- it can only be done in July or

20

August and at no other time.

election precincts are divided, or the boun­

21

In any event, it is a factor in this lawsuit

22

simply because of‘.this Court's holding in East Carroll

23

Parish v. Marshall, in which the fact that a Louisiana

24

police jury had no authority to reapportion itself pur­

25

suant to an enabling statute which had been questioned
5

1

by the Attorney General was suggested to be dispositive

2

of the question whether the particular plan was a court-

3

ordered plan or was a legislative plan.

4

the trial court did review the plan and in its order stated

5

that he had considered the Plaintiff's objections to the

6

plan as well, and the Plaintiff did come forward with

7

evidence challenging the proposed plan on the basis that

8

it did dilute Mexican-American voting strength.

9

concluded that the plan was acceptable and ordered that

10

The Court

it should be used in 1980.

1 1

12

In any event,

QUESTION:

Did the District Court in any way

alter the plan as proposed?'

13

MR. HALL:

No, Your Honor, the District Court

14

did not.

15

followed a series of procedural steps which resulted in

16

the Fifth Circuit's summary determination that the plan

17

could not be used and should be submitted to the Attorney

18

General or to the District Court in the District of Columbia

19

for preclearance under the Voting Rights Act before it could

20

be put into effect.

21

tion presented-- the question presented here, whether

22

a plan conceived as this one was, in the course of liti­

23

gation which had been long since commenced was required

24

to be submitted for Section 5 preclearance or whether

25

the District Court could order such a plan into effect

And following his approval of the plan, there

And of course, that raises the ques­

6

1

2

without preclearance.
QUESTION:

Did you argue to the Fifth Circuit

3

that the Commissioners' Court didn't have power to re­

4

apportion itself in accordance with this plan?

5

MR. HALL:

We did in a motion for rehearing,

6

Your Honor.

7

was presented to the Fifth Circuit in a series of briefs

8

that were directed toward a summary reversal of the

9

District Court's order.

10

The truth of the matter is that the question

QUESTION:

Well because the per curiam in the

1 1

Court of Appeals says "by submitting a proposed

12

ment plan to the District Court, the Kleberg County

13

Commissioners' Court complied with and fulfilled its

14

legislative responsibilities."

15

MR. HALL:

reapportion­

Well I think, Your Honor, that the

16

legislative responsibilities of which the Fifth Circuit

17

was speaking was -- a one to which this Court has addressed

18

so many times, and that is simply the preparation of a

19

plan or the submission of a plan at the direction of the

20

Trial Court rather than the preparation of that plan by

21

the Trial Court itself.

22

of legislative duty which is suggested.

23
24

25

QUESTION:

I think that's the fulfillment

That isn't quite what this language

says, is it?
MR. HALL:

I'm sorry?
7

1

QUESTION:

That isn't quite what this language

2

says; you're saying -- all you're saying is that the

3

party to a lawsuit was asked to submit a plan and it did.

4

The Court of Appeals says it did it legislatively.

5

MR. HALL:

Well, Your Honor, I can only suppose

6

what the Fifth Circuit was speaking to there, but I

7

think that all the Fifth Circuit was saying was that this

8

was not a plan which was a court-ordered plan; it was not

9

a plan which was prepared judicially it was prepared legis-

10

atil/ely, in the sense that the trial court told the county,

11

one of the parties, to go out and prepare and return with

12

a plan and the county did return with a plan and in that

13

sense it was a legislative plan.

14

not a plan --

15

QUESTION:

In that sense only, it was

Would you make the same argument if

16

the Court had simply issued a declaratory judgment in­

17

validating the old plan and giving the Commissioners' Court

18

a certain time to come up with a new ordinance or whatever

19

-- what is it you called it, an ordinance, or --

20
21

22

MR. HALL:

It would be an order of Commissioners'

QUESTION:

An order, yes.

Court -If that's all the

23

Court had done -- we'll give you time, like Courts usually

24

do, to reapportion yourself.

25

MR. HALL:

Well, in truth, Your Honor, that is
.

8

1

what is done with the exception that the trial court did

2

not tell the Commissioners' Court to go reapportion

3

itself and --

4
5

6

QUESTION:

It

said -- submit a new plan, that's

what they said.
MR. HALL:

They said submit a new plan to the

7

Court, not go out and prepare one and adopt it and follow

8

such procedures as might be appropriate if you were not

9

in the middle of a suit challenging the constitutionality

10
11

of the existing plan.
QUESTION:

Well is it true that in order to comply

12

with the Court's view of what was wrong with the old plan,

13

that the Commissioners' Court would not have the power

14

under your view of their power, to reapportion themselves

15

constitutionally?

16

at this time to split precincts?

17

MR. HALL:

In that they wouldn't have the power

No, Your Honor.

The Commissioners'

18

Court would have had the power to reapportion itself into

19

four Commissioners' precincts.

20

that it may do so from time to time as it deems appropriate.

21

So there's no question about its power to do that.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

The Texas Constitution says

So it could have complied with the

constitutional requirements on its own?
MR. HALL:

It could have complied with that.

The

question is whether it could have achieved a satisfactory
9

1

one-man-one-vote result without dividing election pre­

2

cincts .
QUESTION:

3
4

what I'm getting at.

Well that's what I'm getting at.

That's

Would it have had the power to bring

5

itself into compliance with the one-man-one-vote require­

6

ment?
MR. HALL:

7

Well, truthfully that question was

8

not litigated, and I know it is raised by the Respondent,

9

Your Honor, but the answer is it would not have had the

10

power to do it in the abstract, if there

had been no

11

lawsuit, the Commissioners' Court would not have had the

12

power under Texas law to redrawn its Commissioner precinct

13

lines if, in order to do that, it had to split some existing

14

election precinct lines.
You see, a Commissioners' precinct might be

15
16

made up of 6 or 8 election precincts which are subdivis-

17

ioned within the Commissioners' precinct.

18

understand the state statute to prohibit is the dividing

19

or splitting of one of those sub-divisions, one of those

20

election precincts, at any time other than in July or

21

August.

22

QUESTION:

And what I

So if the Commissioners' Court had

23

responded to the court by saying in order to satisfy you

24

we would have to exceed our powers and we just can't,

25

we just are forbidden to propose the plan?
10

1

MR. HALL:

If that

2

QUESTION:

Then the Court would have had to draw

3

up its own plan, I suppose.

4

have been subject to clearance, preclearance.

5

6
7

MR. HALL:

And that clearly wouldn't

That would be true.

If the County

had come back with any excuse, which amounted to a refusal
to do it --

8

QUESTION:

Or a claim of inability?

9

MR. HALL:

That's true.

It said it was unable

10

to do it, it just wasn't physically possible, as

1 1

case it might, it could have come back and said it's too

12

late we're almost to the 1980 elections --

13

QUESTION:

Well you,

in this

in essence claim that

14

they were forbidden under state law to give a legislative

15

response to the Court's request, which is a perfectly

16

legitimate argument.

17

MR. HALL:

It's a legitimate argument, Your Honor,

18

but in all candor, that's not really what I am saying,

19

because I understand you to be asking me whether it would

20

have been physically possible to come up with some other plan

21

which would have achieved the one-man-one-vote result that was

22

desired without splitting any of the sub-precincts, these

23

election precincts.

24

QUESTION:

And you think it wasn't?

25

MR. HALL:

Sir?
11

1

QUESTION:

You don't think it was possible?

2

MR. HALL:

I don't know whether it was or not.

3

I know that the Respondent --

4

QUESTION:

5

Well if it was impossible, the Commis­

sioners' Court wouldn't have had the power to achieve it.

6

MR. HALL:

That's true.

That's correct.

7

QUESTION:

Well then, is what you're saying that

8

had these original plaintiffs simply come to the Commis­

9

sioners' court and said we don't think the present voting

10

lines conform to one-man-one-vote rule, we want you to

11

change them, that they would not have had the authority

12

under Texas law to change them and the plaintiffs would have

13

had to go into federal court to get them changed?

14

MR. HALL:

No, Your Honor, that's not the case.

15

The Commissioners' Court would have had the authority to

16

change the Commissioner's precinct line, but not if in

17

order to achieve one-man-one-vote balance they had also

18

had to split or divide some of these voting precincts, if

19

in order to get the right number of people in each of the

20

four Commissioners' precincts it had been necessary for the

21

Commissioners' Court to break up an existing voting precinct

22

-- to say, okay, part of you who voted in voting precinct

23

21 are now going to be in a different precinct -- if they

24

had had to do that they would have been without authority

25

to do it under the Texas decision, but if they had not
12

1

been required to vote, to change voting precincts, to

2

alter the boundaries of those, then it would have been

3

within their power to make the change.

4

In any event, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the

5

plan which had been submitted to the trial court and which

6

had been approved by the trial court could not be used

7

because it had not been precleared under Section 5 of the

8

Voting Rights Act and directed that the trial court

9

-- and held that the trial court should not have considered

10

the constitutionality of the new plan before it had been

11

precleared, remanded the case, the petition for certiorari

12

was filed -- and that brings us to this moment.

13

QUESTION;

Before you get into your argument, may

14

I ask a question about the legislative authority?

15

because the -- assuming it was necessary to break up the

16

voting precincts in order to satisfy the one-man-one-vote

17

requirement, could some other legislative body have had

18

the authority to do that?

19

MR. HALL:

No, Your Honor.

If,

I don't know whether

20

the question has arisen.

The only authority I am going

21

on is Article 2.041 of the Texas Statutes, which simply

22

provides that the election voting precincts may not be

23

altered other than by the Commissioners ' Court -- other

24

than July or August.

25

Texas of which I am aware, that would have the power to

And there is no other authority in

13

1

alter election precincts other than in July or August.
QUESTION:

2
3
4

5

6

Well then, if there’s that restric­

tion on breaking up election precincts and if that would
prevent a one-person-one-vote satisfactory response would
it not necessarily follow that that restriction was invalid
as a matter of federal law?
MR. HALL:

7

I haven't had the question, Your Honor,

8

and I don't know whether it would be or not.

9

see why that's not a reasonable requirement -QUESTION:

10

I don't really

Well but it's a requirement that

11

would make it impossible to comply with the Equal Protec­

12

tion Clause if it was faithfully followed, isn't that what

13

you're -MR. HALL:

14

No, not really, because in any July

15

or August the Commissioners' Court would have the auth­

16

ority to do that and the problem is simply one of timing

17

with respect to an upcoming election.

18

Texas has simply said we don't want the Commissioners'

19

Court doing a lot of changing of voting precincts any

20

closer to an upcoming election than July or August and I

21

think that's a reasonable provision by the state legisla­

22

ture .
QUESTION:

23

The legislature in

But why July and August?

24

time prior to September 1?

25

June ?

Why not any

What if they do it in May or

14

MR. HALL:

1

I suspect, Your Honor, that --

2

I don't know why at the particular time, I suspect that

3

almost any change could run afoul of the primary and

4

general election problems that we have in Texas.

5

speaking, primary elections are held in May and the

6

general election in November, and I don't -- I don't

7

suppose that -- well a change even in July or August in

8

an election year would alter the voting pattern or the

9

place of votes between the date of the primary and Qf the

10

Generally

general elections.

11

So I can't answer your question.

I don't know

12

why that particular restriction, I don't know -- it's not

13

been challenged, that I'm aware of, on constitutional

14

grounds.

15

QUESTION:

16

at the end of July?

17

MR. HALL:

Your Honor, I do not know.

18

QUESTION:

Maybe it wasn't --

19

MR. HALL:

For as long as I can recall, it has

20

But didn't the primary used to be held

been held in May and the Court may be correct about that.

21

QUESTION:

I'm not sure.

22

MR. HALL:

All right, sir.

In any event, the

23

decision of the Fifth Circuit brings

24

a number of reasons for believing that Section 5 of the

25

Voting Rights Act as it relates to preclearance should not
15

us here and we have

1

be applicable in a case which is already in a federal

2

district court and already subject to constitutional scru­

3

tiny .

4

The first reason for this is that as we view the

5

Voting Rights Act, it assumes the existence and the contin­

6

uation of an existing plan, both the legislative history

7

and the decisions of this Court have referred to the

8

effect of the plan -- of the Voting Rights Act in Section

9

5 as in effect, freezing into use and existence an existing

10

plan, and if that were the case there would be no problem

11

or hardship so far as the election process in the County

12

is concerned because it would, as it went through the

13

machinery prescribed by the Voting Rights Act, have an

14

existing plan that could be used during the time required for

15

that procedure.

16

for the presentation of a new plan is an order of a federal

17

court striking down the old plan, there is no plan then to

18

be frozen into effect and there is no plan prepared or par­

19

ticipated in by the local, political subdivisions which

20

can be utilized during the interim.

But that is not the case where the catalyst

21

We also think that the language of the Voting

22

Rights Act which speaks to changes in procedure which a

23

subdivision, political subdivision "enacts or seeks to

24

administer" is not simply fortuitous language; we think

25

that the legislature meant what it said, that it was
16

1

speaking of changes that were voluntarily undertaken by

2

a political subdivision, that is, the political subdivision

3

enacted or sought to administer a particular plan which was

4

different from the one that had existed before and which

5

had been frozen into effect.
This is not a case in which the Commissioners'

6
7

Court enacted or sought to administer a new plan, it did

8

neither.

9

its old plan and that it should submit a new plan.

It was told by the trial court it could not use

10

that reason also, we think,

11

apply in a case involving these circumstances.

12

So, for

the Voting Rights Act does not

Third, the Voting Rights Act and the decisions of

13

this Court speak to the purpose of insuring that there is

14

a federal presence in the formulation of any plan which is

15

different from the one Which had been frozen into effect

16

by the Voting Rights Act.

17

in this case, very much so; we have the most intense federal

18

presence that you could imagine, in the discarding of the

19

old plan and the formulation of the new plan.

20

federal district judge in Corpus Christi, Texas, one county

21

over from Kleberg County, that was aware of all the facts.

22

He had already listened in detail to the plaintiff's class

23

action challenge of the existing plan, he knew intimately

24

what the.circumstances and background were.

25

no better forum anywhere to consider the changes which were

And we have a federal presence

17

We had a

And there was

1

proposed than the local federal district court.

2

objective of the Voting Rights Act, we think, has been

3

squarely met in the case of a plan which is presented

4

following the striking down of an existing plan by a

5

federal district court.

6

QUESTION:

If that's the objective.

So that

The -- I

7

suppose the other side of the coin is, that the federal

8

presence of which you speak is a specific federal presence,

9

namely, the Attorney General of the District Court of the

10

District of Columbia?

11

MR. HALL:

Well that, I'm sure is the argument

12

in support of the applicability of the Voting Rights Act,

13

Your Honor, but certainly the legislative history didn't

14

s peak to that.

It does -- it does speak to the existence

15

of a body of expertise, and uniformity that is sought by

16

channeling all of these decisions through the Attorney

17

General or the District Court of the District of Columbia,

18

but for the life of me, I don't see that the Attorney Gen­

19

eral or the District Court of the District of Columbia,

20

no

disparagement intended, has any greater expertise in

21

a case of this type where a local federal district court

22

has already considered in great detail in an adversary

23

proceeding, the various factors which would affect the

24

formulation of a new claim.

25

And finally, it seems to me that the Voting Rights
18

does not contemplate the existence of a pending suit

1

2

which already raises constitutional issues which the

3

-- with which the local federal court has grappled.

4

that is perhaps a different facet of the suggestion that

5

where you do have a federal presence already involved with

6

a

lawtsuit there is no occasion to seek further federal

presence in the form of an Attorney General or the District

Court in the District of Columbia.
The decision, we think, of the Fifth Circuit

ignores completely this Court's decision in East Carroll

Parish School Board v. Marshall, in which, in virtually

12

identical situation, the question was raised in an amicus

curiae brief by the United States and in which .this Court

14

said that Section 5 preclearance was not required in the

15

case of a plan which was prepared at the instance of a

16

federal district court and submitted to a federal district

17

court.

18

The -- I would like to point out that I see more

19

problems with requiring preclearance of a plan conceived in

20

the course of existing district court litigation, than I

21

do in, in not requiring preclearance.

22

course, is the tremendous delay and expense incident to a

23

preclearance procedure when you already have a pending law­

follow that, and then, the case could go back to the trial
court where, by the express terms of the Voting Rights Act,
the question of constitutionality could be litigated.

And

if the trial court should determine at that point that
the plan was unconstitutional although it didn't violate
the provisions of the Voting Rights Act, we would start,
I gather, all over on this procedure.

And I think that

Court

and I think it -- it insures a multiplicity of liti­

conceive that a political subdivision which does not wish

playing the game of proceeding to the Attorney

General, of submitting half-hearted plans and so forth.

the question then of why it should be that a district court

district court has sufficient ability and expertise to

prepare its own plan, but not to review a plan prepared or

to the question of preclearance is directed towards volun­

HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. PARMLEY, ESQ.,

13
14
15
16

Mr. Parmley.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PARMLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Before addressing the Defendant's argument, I'd

17

like to elaborate a little on some of the judicial decisions

18

and actions in this case.

19

mately one year after the trial on the merits, the district

20

court found that Kleberg County was mal-apportioned and in

21

the October 2nd order the district court informed the defen­

22

dant that the initial burden of fashioning the constitu­

23

tionally acceptable remedy was on the Commissioners' Court,

24

the district court quoting Wise, then advised the defendants

25

that it would afford them a reasonable opportunity to meet

On October 2nd, 1979, approxi­

21

1

constitutional requirements by adopting a substitute measure

2

and that the Commissioners' Court was unwilling or unable

3

to present the Court with a substitute plan, then it would

4

become the unwelcome obligation of the District Court

5

to devise its own plan.

6

The District Court then directed the Commissioners'

7

Court to come up with a plan and a hearing was set on

8

that plan on December 10, 1979, approximately 60 -- two

9

months later.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Parmley, do you think that Wise

11

contemplated, when it spoke of the unwelcome responsibil­

12

ity of federal courts and thelegislative responsibility

13

to comply with the one-man-one-vote rule, that it contem­

14

plated an action by a Commissioners' Court such as this

15
16

that was forbidden by state law, if in fact it was forbidden?
MR. PARMLEY:

Well Your Honor, I don't believe

17

that the Commissioners' Court action in this case was

18

forbidden by state law.

19

20
21

22
23

QUESTION:

Suppose it was, then answer Justice

Rehnquist's question.
MR. PARMLEY:

Whether or not Wise would have --

I'm not sure I understand the question.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose that state statute

24

forbade the county court from doing what the District Court

25

asked it to do.

Do you think that the District Court,
22

25

nonetheless, should have required it to do it, or should
it simply have devised a plan of its own, realizing that
the county court was prohibited by a state statute from
itself acting at that particular time?
MR. PARMLEY:

I think the District Court was

aware that the legislative body had presented a plan
that it did not have legislative authority to present;
that the District Court should have instructed that legis­
lative body to go back and respond to its duty to present
a valid substitute.
QUESTION:

As a party to the lawsuit, but not as a

legislative body, couldn't that be?

I mean, as a legis­

lative body, it is, I suppose, bound by Texas law, but as
a party to the lawsuit, it is bound by the orders of the
District Court.
MR. PARMLEY:

Well, I guess it's just a question

of whether or not the District Court can defer twice to
the legislative body.

If it's only given one shot, then I

would say if it came forward with a plan that was invalid
under state law, then I would say a second plan would not
be afforded legislative deference and it would be considered
as any other plan presented by a party to the lawsuit.
QUESTION:
view of the

It's a pretty important question in

dicennial

census,

isn't it?

Because

presumably a lot of state and municipal subdivisions are
23

1

going to be subject to suit if they don't redistrict

2

themselves on ‘the basis of new population figures and yet

3

if the District Court in which the suit is brought finds

4

that they are mal-apportioned and directs them to submit

5

a plan, they may be under some state law restraint as

6

to whether or not they can do the particular thing

7

that the District Court wants.
MR. PARMLEY:

8
9

Yes sir, I understand that position,

but I believe that legislative history will show that

10

a correct application of Section 5 is that whenever --

1 1

when the legislative body has received a judicial deferral,

12

to come up and present a substitute plan, when that

13

legislative body has finalized its plan which incorporates

14

public policy objectives and is preparing to submit that

15

plan to the District Court, it is in effect seeking to

16

administer that plan through incorporation in the court's

17

order.

18

poration in the court's order it falls under the opera­

19

tional language of Section 5, which is whenever a political

20

subdivision seeks to administer a voting change then that

21

change must be precleared.

22

the legislative body in that particular case, as part of

23

its legislative duty to come forward with a valid plan,

24

would have had to have Section 5 preclearance.

25

of whether or not it actually had legislative authority

And by seeking to administer that plan, by incor­

Our position would be that

24

The issue

1

does not matter because although -- because, the plan

2

could be implemented through the court order.

3

language is to seek to administer, it doesn't necessarily

4

require that they have to enact it.

5

QUESTION:

Operational

What if the census shows, the 1980

6

census figures show that this Kleberg County Commissioners'

7

Court is mal-apportioned, then the Commissioners' Court

8

simply sits on its hands and does nothing so that it

9

can't be accused of seeking to institute any new thing

10

that would be required -- preclearance under Section 5.

1 1

Nonetheless, Plaintiffs bring an action in the District

12

Court saying you're violating our constitutional rights

13

because it's not one-man-one-vote.

14

between a rock and a hard place, aren't they?

15

MR. PARMLEY:

They're kind of

Well, I think that the legisla­

16

tive history of Section 5 supports the application which

17

I just told you, that in Fourteenth Amendment cases, where

18

there is a violation that is found by the Court -- at the

19

1975 extension hearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee

20

Report specifically stated that after the invalidation of

21

a plan by the -- and legislative deferrment, the Court

22
23
24
25

should defer its consideration of plans presented to it
until such times .as these plans have been submitted for
Section 5 review.

Only after such review should the Court

proceed with any remaining -25

QUESTION:

1

Well Mr.1 Parmley, what if in this

2

case the Commissioners' Court had said judge, we just

’

3

don't want to come up with a plan and -- it's too difficult

4

and we don't think we have the authority and even if we

5

did, we just don't agree with you that the old one is bad,

6

we're going to appeal and meanwhile, the -- if you want to

7

put in your own, fine, go ahead.

8

judge would have held the Commissioners' Court in contempt,

do you?

You don't think the

it and enforce that order?

MR. PARMLEY:

It can give, the legislative

No, Your Honor.

My reading of

Wise is that the
QUESTION:

Well what if --what then if the

16

Commissioners' Court just sits on its hands as Justice

17

Rehnquist says, and once the declaratory judgment is

18

issued it just doesn't do anything.

19

going to prepare its own plan, isn't it?

20

MR. PARMLEY:

The Court then is

Or invite the Plaintiffs to submit

21

plans and that may be an incentive for the legislative body

22

to come up with their own.

23

QUESTION:

Well it may be, but if they don't, then

24

-- and the Court puts in its own plan, then under our --

25

unless we overrule our cases, the Court plan isn't subject
26

1

to preclearance, is it?
MR. PARMLEY:

2
3

That's correct.

But the legisla­

tive body does not propose a plan -QUESTION:

4

So it may be that we're not arguing

5

about much here, in the sense that a Commissioners' Court

6

could just -- or any legislative body after a declaration

7

of unconstitutionality of an old plan is just going -- it

8

doesn't want to preclear, it just isn't going to submit a

9

plan.

Of course, a lot of legislative bodies would rather

10

have their own plan in than a Court's plan.

1 1

theless, there is a way of avoiding preclearance, apparently.
QUESTION:

12

But never­

Well if he's -- if you're -- if he's

13

right.

Here, the District Court used the word directed;

14

with that in mind, the defendants are hereby directed to

15

submit a proposed new plan by the 13th day of November,

16

1979.

Do you think that that should be read as requested?

17

MR. PARMLEY:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. PARMLEY:

20

Yes, Your Honor.

Though it's not the word he used.
Well he said directed but he also

said he was -- affording them an equal opportunity -QUESTION:

21

And that -- if the defendants didn't

22

comply with the direction they might be in contempt of

23

Court.

24
25

QUESTION:

But you just suggested that probably

the Court didn't have power to order anybody to submit a
27

1

2

plan, a legislative body to submit a plan.
MR. PARMLEY:

Well I think it could order -- I

3

think it should order a legislative body to come forward

4

with a plan.

5

6

QUESTION:

And here it seems to have done so, by

use of the word directed.

It didn't say requested.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Parmley, could it be --

8

QUESTION:

Or given an opportunity to.

9

QUESTION:

Could it be that whether he used

10

requested, directed or suggested, what it means is if you

11

won't prepare one I will?

12

MR. PARMLEY:

13

QUESTION:

That's my understanding.

Could not the legislative body

14

frustrate even the most mandatory direction by submitting

15

a plan that was, on its face, unacceptable?

16

the Court in the position of having to do its own plan.

17
18

MR. PARMLEY:

And then put

Yes, Your Honor, but I would say that

t here would be an incentive not to do that because the

19

Court may adopt the Plaintiffs plan, and I don't think a

20

legislative body would want to have the plaintiff's plan

21

adopted, but --

22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

Here did the Plaintiffs submit a plan?

MR. PARMLEY:

Yes, Your Honor, they did.

But it

was submitted at the trial on the merits, and I might add
that that plan did not split election precincts.
28

1

QUESTION:

Of course, part of the Plaintiff's

2

case was the dilution of the votes of the Mexican-American

3

voters, a claim that was rejected by the District Court.

4

MR. PARMLEY:

5

QUESTION:

Yes sir, that's so.

Correct?

And did the Plaintiff's plan

6

meet the Plaintiff's theory in that regard, that it diluted

7

the votes of Mexican-American voters?

8
9

MR. PARMLEY:

tiffs plan tried to correct that.

10
1 1

No, but in our opinion, the Plain­

QUESTION:

Yes, well that -- and that claim was

rejected by the District Court.

12

MR. PARMLEY:

The Court yes, the District Court

13

found there was no dilution in Mexican-American voting

14

strength.

15
16

QUESTION:

Right.

But that there was a violation

of the one-person-one-vote principle.

17

MR. PARMLEY:

18

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Maybe I missed something, but what

19

would be the constitutional objection to a District Court

20

ordering the party to a lawsuit who is found to have vio-

21

ated the law, from proposing a remedy?

22
23
24

25

I don't under­

stand why there would be any constitutional objection to
such an order.
MR. PARMLEY:

Well, I believe they could.

in Burns v. Richardson.

1

I think the Count there ordered them to come up with an

interim plan and they in fact did.

3

to that is yes, they can order them to come up with a

legislative plan.

QUESTION:

So I guess the answer

That is, order them at the pain of

MR. PARMLEY:

me that the -QUESTION:

You mean an entire state legislature

as in Burns?
QUESTION:

Well that's an issue that we don't

have directly,
QUESTION:

Well what happens to the County in

16

the meantime then?

17

prior statute it had was bad or the ordinance it had was

18

bad, and the Court is not satisfied with the plan proposed

19

by the Defendant, it is unwilling to adopt the Plaintiff's

20

plan, doesn't it have to simply impose a plan of its own?

21

How is it governed if the -- if the

MR. PARMLEY:

Yes, I think it would impose,

22

probably an interim plan, and possibly request the Defendants

23

to come back with a satisfactory plan, -- if that's the

24

legislative body --

25

QUESTION;

Well under our cases, it wouldn't

necessarily be reversible error if pending a new plan

we've sustained that.
MR. PARMLEY:

Even the unconstitutional one,

Yes, that's correct.

The District

Court could do that, under its power.
In relation to the legislative authority of the

left out in my brief that I would like to bring

10

the Texas Attorney General.

11

M606, and the facts of the case are that Bailey County,

12

Texas redistricted their Commissioners' Court precinct

13

lines in January of 1970 and in the process of redistricting

14

their Commissioners' Court precinct lines they split

election precincts.

the Attorney General and said now that we've split election

That opinion is opinion number

Bailey County then sent a letter to

18

the Commissioners' Court precincts?

19

responded and said yes, I understand your situation, you

20

did split the election precincts, that's fine.

21

cannot now conform them; you have to wait until the July

and the Texas Constitution that have been argued back and

forth here today.

of Wilson v. Weller, which the Petitioners depended on for

4

their support, but they did not have legislative authority.

5

I might add that in the case of Wilson v. Weller, that involve d

6

a single unitary order of Kleberg County; it involved the

7

same county, where they redistricted Commissioners' Court

8

precincts and election precincts at the same time, in the

same order.

The Attorney General also cited the case

And the Court in that case found that they

10

could not redistrict election precincts, although they

1 1

could redistrict Commissioners' Court precincts they could

12

not redistrict election precincts, and they invalidated that

part of the order in reference to the redistricting of the

ON BEHALF OF THE U.S. AS AMICUS CURIAE

21

23
24

25

Mr. Wallace’.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

20

22

Yes sir.

MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Counsel for the Petitioners has correctly stated
that there was a federal presence to which the Commissioners'
Court submitted their proposal for reapportionment, but
32

1

that was wholly apart from who the federal presence was.

2

The District Court did not purport to apply the standards

3

of Section 5, did not make any inquiry about whether there

4

was a retrogression in the treatment of minority voters

5

within the meaning of this Court's decision in Beer, let

6

alone place the burden of proof on the covered

7

diction that it would have to sustain under Section 5 in

8

proving that the purpose or effect is not to discriminate.

9

The question before the Court is really a narrow

juris­

10

question of statutory interpretation about the meaning of

11

the words seek to administer.

12

that the Court has found recurringly troublesome in trying to

13

interrelate Section 5 with

14

there is, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has suggested, a need for

15

as much clarification as possible now, with all the re­

16

apportionments that will be resulting from the 1980 census.

17

In Section 5, it's a question

reapportionment litigation and

For the interpretation of this language to be

18

consistent with the statutory purpose, it is crucial in our

19

view that two very serious pitfalls be avoided.

20

avoid an interpretation that gives jurisdictions covered by

21

Section 5 a dis-incentive to reapportion themselves.

22

is settled by this Court's decisions and by the legislative

23

history that Section 5 does apply to reapportionments, and

24

this Court has reiterated time and again that reapportion­

25

ment is principally and ideally, a legislative function
33

One is to

It

1

and that legislative bodies should be given an opportunity

2

to undertake to do the reapportionment on their own.

3

But it's always easy in these situations for a legislature to

4

do nothing and to hold back as was the case of the

5

Commissioners' Court here until 8 years after the 1970 census

6

And it's not uncommon in

7

us to encounter this kind of holding back even under the

8

1970 census, particularly if there's hope that thereby a

9

reapportionment will eventually be achieved after someone

covered

jurisdictions for

10

brings a lawsuit without the necessity to submit the legis­

11

lature's proposal for Section 5 preclearance.

12

And if the covered

jurisdiction can avoid

13

submitting the proposal that way and still propose it to

14

the reapportionment court, under an entitlement to def­

15

erence from that Court under this Court's decision in

16

Wise v. Lipscomb, the deference that would be afforded to

17

a legislative proposal.

18

us, to widespread evasion of this Court's decision in

19

Georgia v. United States; that the protections of Section 5

20

are going to be available for reapportionments and the

21

congressional purpose that's been strongly stated in the

22

legislative history and the reenactments of Section 5, that

23

reapportionment provides a special danger to minority voting

24

rights and it's important that the protection be afforded.

25

Then the way is open it seems to

Now this brings me to the second interrelated
34

1

pitfall.that it is very important to avoid, and that is

2

creation of a gap or a loophole in the protection afforded

3

by one or the other of two lines of decisions of this Court.

4

One of those lines of decisions holds that efforts by

5

covered

6

precleared

7

reapportionment or other voting right litigation, that is,

8

Connor v. Waller and related writings in other cases.

9

jurisdictions to reapportion themselves must be
even if those efforts occur in the course of

And the second line of decisions is that judicially

10

imposed reapportionments heed not be precleared, but they

11

are subject to special remedial standards and those

12

standards are protective of minority voting rights in

13

the application, even though they are not identical to

14

Section 5.

And our principle submission is that the stan­

15

dards for what is a legislative plan and what is a court-

16

imposed plan should be the same for purposes of both of these

17
18

lines of decisions. The Court's opinions have assumed that
the standard is the same --

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, the substantive standards are a

little different when you come to multi-member''

districts ,

and so on.
HR. WALLACE:

That's right.

The substantive

standards are the same, but in defining what is a courtordered plan and what is a legislative plan, as we've set
out on pages 28 and 29 of our brief, opinions of this
35

1

2
3
4
5

6
7

8
9

Court have assumed

that you arrive at the same answer

for both purposes and Congress has certainly operated on the
assumption that there is not going to be a gap in protec­
tion, whereby in a covered

jurisdiction the reapportion­

ment can occur without either protection being afforded
minority voting rights, and so our proposed solution, the
interpretation that we

espouse

and that Mr. Parmley was

espousing is one that we have proposed to the Court before.
But happily, it's one that is consistent as we see it

10

with the statutory language and with the legislative his­

11

tory to the extent that that legislative history specif­

12

ically addresses this question and it does, in the 1975

13

Senate Report.
And that is that seeks to administer does embrace

14
15

a proposal by the coveredjurisdiction to a reapportionment

16

court, that that court order into effect the reapportion­

17

ment plan

18

course of litigation proposing.

19

really should turn on the niceties of state law, about

the county or the political entity that's going to be

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

that kind of administering?

15

Yes.

MR. WALLACE:

10

13

-- replicating the court's plan,

MR. WALLACE:

Well there was some suggestion in

the Senate Committee Report, in 1975, that there would be
preclearance even then.

And you know, obviously, the

full protection of Section 5 might not be available in that

18

situation without preclearance, however there is consid­
19

erable protection for minority voting interests in the
20

remedial standards that this Court has developed for court
21

ordered plans and it perhaps would not be amiss to say
22

in

covered

jurisdictions, the court in ordering such a

23

plan into effect also should consider whether there would
24

be a retrogressive effect, such as the Court spoke of in
25

Beer.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, may I ask you a question

2

about the burden imposed by Section 5 on the Attorney

3

General?

4

last year?

6

How many applications for clearance were filed

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I'm sure the number is very

large, Mr. Justice, but I don't have it at my fingertips.

7

QUESTION:

In the Sheffield case, that was here, I

8

think in 1978 -- it was then indicated that they were coming

9

in

at about the rate of 1000 a year?

10

MR. WALLACE:

11

QUESTION:

I think that's correct.

And that's four per business day,

12

approximately.

13

within 60 days.

14

of four per day is the Attorney General able to give to

15

these applications?

16

And they must be considered and acted on
How much time per application at the rate

MR. WALLACE:

Well there is a considerable staff

17

that works on these matters.

18

very routine changes that are precleared without much

19

problem, and about 99 percent of them are precleared.

20

ever, that's not true of apportionments -- reapportionments--

21
22
23

25

QUESTION:

Many of the applications are

Then many of the applications involve

multiple changes?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

How­

Some of them do.

And the Act requires the Attorney

General to exercise his personal discretion.
42

1

MR. WALLACE:

He has, for the most part, dele­

2

gated that authority to the assistant Attorney General

3

for Civil Rights.

4

QUESTION:

At the rate of four a day, and a District

5

Court judge, presumably, spends a good deal more time on

6

questions of this kind than the A. G. could.

7

MR. WALLACE:

He certainly does, Mr. Justice,

8

but -- as I pointed out at the onset, he is not applying

9

the same standards, he's not making the same inquiry at

10

all, even though he's spending more time, nobody has made

11

the inquiry if that's the only inquiry made.

12
13

that Section 5 was designed to have made about whether
there's a retrogressive effect on minority voting rights,

MR. HALL:

If there were ever a disincentive to

reapportionment it seems to me that the scheme proposed by
the Respondents would provide that disincentive.

22

earth would a county submit a plan to a district court for

23

approval?

25

Why would it give the District Court any assis­
If it knew that if it were lucky enough to
accepted, it was then going

1

to be sent off to the Attorney General, to the District
of Columbia, perhaps, and then come back for a subsequent

2

challenge on constitutionality by anyone who wanted to make
3

it, when the opposite choice would be to submit no plan at
4

all or perhaps submit one that was very artfully deficient,

that perhaps even the local federal judge could perceive

the shortcoming in,

let him make the correction and then

it's his plan and you don't have to worry about it.

think this proposal that the United States makes would

just compound the problems of our federal courts and our

political subdivisions.
