IN NOS. 79-1711, 79-1754 g 79-1760
MR. CONFORD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This action present important questions as to the

12

13

consequences of the adoption of recent comprehensive water

14

pollution legislation.

15

as the Clean Water Act, adopted in 1972 is an extensive

16

revision of previous federal water pollution legislation.

The second statute involved, commonly known as the Ocean

18

Dumping Act, adopted in 1972, and also amended in 1977.

One of these statutes, commonly known

This is an action brought by an association of

19

20

fishermen claiming to have been injured by pollution of the

21

ocean by some six or seven New Jersey sewerage agencies and

Three issues evolved from

These are, first, whether there was an implied

private remedy flowing from these statutes.

Secondly, whether

9

private parties' plaintiffs have standing to invoke the

10

federal common law nuisance remedy declared by this Court

11

in Illinois v. Milwaukee.

12

such status for a private action it has been preempted by

13

14

to the complaint in this case.

And third, whether if there is

In view of the time constraints that I am under in

16

this matter, I propose with the Court's leave to address the

17

second and third issues, on which I am opposed both by the

Solicitor General and the respondents.

19

supports us only on the first issue, that concerning whether

20

there was an implied cause of action.

No.

If there is no im­

QUESTION:

I see.

3

QUESTION:

But he disagrees with you on that?

4

MR.

C0NF0RD:

Yes.

That is right.

I turn to the second

5

issue, which will be found to share a common rationale with

6

the third issue as I develop it.

7

should today declare that there is an across-the-board remedy

8

available to anybody based on common law nuisance.

12

13

available-to-anybody, federal cause of action for nuisance

14

in the context of the simultaneous existence of these com­

15

prehensive regulatory water pollution statutes?

16

a consideration of the traditional, well-known bases for the

17

Court enunciating federal common law should dictate that such

18

a cause of action should not exist.

19

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

That is, whether this Court

In short the issue is, should this Court

22

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Conford, you may

continue.
MR. C0NF0RD:

24
25

We’ll resume there at

1 o'clock on that point.

21

23

I submit that

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
5

I should supplement what I said before the recess

1

2

by indicating that all of the sewerage agencies in this case

3

possessed United States EPA permits, both for the sewage

4

effluent and the sewage sludge dumping which are complained

5

of in this action.
Now, as I said before the recess, our conception

6
7

of the applicability of federal common law should be approach?: d

8

in the context of the presently existing situation, not that

9

which existed when this Court last decided this question in

10

Illinois v. Milwaukee.

What we are now confronted with is

1 1

the question of whether federal common law should exist on

12

an across-the-board basis in the context of the comprehensive

13

regulatory mechanism which is constituted both by the Clean

14

Water Act and the Ocean Dumping Act.
Our study of the occasions for declaring federal

15
16

common law as declared by this Court lead us to the conclusion

17

that there is no appropriate occasion now to declare federal

18

common law of the extent demanded by the plaintiffs in this

19

case.

20

common law is where a state is a party to an action, either

21

a state against another state or a state against citizens of

22

another state.

23

tion, there being no statute applicable this Court by neces­

24

sity has had to declare federal common law.

QUESTION:

Well, is this an argument, Judge Conford':

2

In light of the statutes, there's just no room for that.
MR. C0NF0RD:

What I'm trying to do, Justice

3

Brennan, is to indicate that of the generally accepted cri­

4

teria for applying federal common law, none is appropriate to

5

the present situation.

any room for federal

MR. C0NF0RD:

thought necessary to supply statutory interstices.

of a state party, but there is no occasion for applying

20

nuisance, under which a judge, as Justice Douglas said in the

21

Milwaukee case, operates according to no fixed rules but he

22

is the chancellor, exercising his informed judgment as to

23

what should be.

What we have here is clearly not a situation

Which began as an original jurisdiction

case.
MR. C0NF0RD:

7

Exactly.

And the Court, in an effort

8

to serve its policy of not taking original jurisdiction,

9

labored to find an alternate basis for jurisdiction because

10

of its felt need that a state affected by pollution coming

11

from another state ought to be afforded a remedy.
Now, another common basis for applying federal com­

12
13

mon law or creating federal common law is when there is im­

14

plicated a distinct federal policy, sometimes statutory and

15

sometimes not, but the necessity of supplying uniformity so

16

that the same rule applies in all circumstances, whether

17

federal or state.

18

creation of federal common law equally does not exist here.

19

QUESTION:

20

We submit that that criterion for the

And that it should be --

25

MR. C0NF0RD:

Applied uniformly, whether -8

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. C0NF0RD:

3

Uniformly; nationally applicable.
Nationally, whether the problem arose

either in state or federal system.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. C0NF0RD:

Right.
Now, clearly, that does not apply

6

here,

the objective of uniformity.

When you have two sys­

7

tems, one, federal nuisance law and the other, a regulated

8

statutory system, it's the opposite of uniformity. Depending

9

upon the plaintiff's choice to go tort law or go statutory

10

law, you can have two entirely different results.

1 1

in the tort situation itself, there is a built-in factor

12

against uniformity, because two federal district court judges

13

hearing approximately the same kind of a nuisance case could

14

arrive at different subjective judgments as to whether the

15

conduct of the defendant was reasonable.

16

there again, there is no uniformity purpose in setting up

17

these remedies side by side.

18

And even

So we submit,

I can’t think of any other appropriate federal law

19

basis that would be applicable to these situations.

20

having negated those which are generally understood and

21

generally applicable, It must follow that it is not appro­

22

priate to create the federal common law remedy which our

23

adversaries advocate.

24
25

I think

Now, that leads me to the issue of preemption.
We have an unusual type of preemption here.
9

It is not

1

federal statute against state statute.

2

against federal common law.

3

the sake of the argument that there would be a federal across-

4

the-board common law remedy.

5

situation is illustrated by Arizona v. California, in which

6

this Court held that notwithstanding the fact that the Court

7

had created a common law of equitable apportionment of waters

8

in an interstate stream, nevertheless, when the Congress

9

adopted specific legislation reallocating the distribution

It is federal statute

For this purpose I assume for

The applicable rule in this

10

of the waters of the Colorado River, that settled the question

1 1

and it supplanted federal common law of equitable apportion­

12

ment of water.

13
14

QUESTION:

The word, then, is either supplanted,

displaced, whatever It is --

15

MR. C0NF0RD:

16

QUESTION:

Whatever it is --

But it's not preemption, because pre­

17

emption is reserved usually, as you said, to state and

18

federal controversies.

19

MR. C0NF0RD:

20
21

22
23

But it's a type of preemption, and

this Court has certified -QUESTION:

Well, maybe it would be easier to under­

stand if we didn't use the word, preemption.
MR. C0NF0RD:

Well, I think this Court certified

24

the question in those terms, because Justice Douglas sug­

25

gested In the Milwaukee case that a time might come when
10

1

comprehensive federal water pollution legislation

2

preempt the common law.

3

it is not preemption, it's displacement, because Congress has

4

the last word.

5

thus and so and it is contrary to pre-existing federal common

6

law, that's it, and --

I agree with you that conceptually

If Congress decides that the law should be

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. C0NF0RD:

9

might

It's just like a superseding statute.
Exactly.

And we maintain that that

is the situation here. Now, central to this inquiry is a

10

question of, does the reorganization of the federal water

11

pollution act, is it of a scope which should cause a different

12

approach than that which existed when the rudimentary water

13

pollution statute existed prior to 1972?

14

This Court has been instructed on that question by

15

the very able opinion of Judge Tone in the 7th Circuit, in

16

the Illinois-Milwaukee case which you heard in December, whict

17

contains a very comprehensive discussion of the differences

18

between the rudimentary water pollution statute as it existed

19

prior to 1972 and as it exists now.

20

most pithy summary of what Congress intended to do and what

21

Congress thought of the old statute is a quotation from the

22

Senate Public Works Committee report on the 1972 amendments.

23

And here's what they said:

But I think the best and

"Water pollution

24

control in the past has been all too often sporadic, incon­

25

sistent, and improvised on an ad hoc basis."
11

They said,

1

"Our major purpose in adopting this legislation is to estab­

2

lish a comprehensive, long-range policy for the elimination

3

of water pollution, making it clear to industry and munici­

4

palities alike what the water pollution performance will be

5

expected of them during the coming decade."

6

That states it better than I possibly could.

7

QUESTION:

Before you finish with your argument,

8

will you explain your position with regard to the savings

9

clauses ?

10
11

MR. C0NF0RD:

Yes, I'll be glad to do that now.

I was going to do it later.

12

The question is, does the savings clause in both

13

of these statutes operate to compel the adoption of the

14

previously existing federal common law of nuisance?

15

does not.

16

and common law.

17

actually mean federal common law when It said common law.

18

When Congress talks about common law, ordinarily I think they

19

mean state common law, general common law.

20

I say it

In the first place, the reference is to statutes
In my judgment the legislature did not

QUESTION:

Secondly --

Well, Isn't that true throughout the law1:

21

Common law without any adjectives means -- does not embrace

22

federal common law.

23

MR. C0NF0RD:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. C0NF0RD:

You mean, whether it does?

Does not.
It does not?
12

That's my opinion.

Secondly, the argument that it means federal common

1

2

law is hardly realistic in the light of the fact that the

3

concept concerning federal common law in the water pollution

4

area was only developed by this Court in 1972.

5

tion was going through the legislature and had adopted this

6

language before the Court spoke in 1972 in Illinois v.

7

Milwaukee.
And, thirdly, if it were to be accepted for the

sake of argument that it did mean federal common law, that

15

believe, completely.

the ball back in this Court's jurisdiction, because

And for the reasons which I have already

Now, what they did mean by the savings clause, in

17

my judgment, was state statutes and state common law.

18

ample, the Water Pollution Act specifically invites states to

19

participate by adopting more stringent regulations, by setting

20

up area-wide water quality standards, and New Jersey, in fact,

21

has adopted legislation along both of these lines.

22

adopted in 1977 both a water pollution control act consistent

23

with the federal act, and an area --

24

25

QUESTION:

For ex­

New Jersey

I gather the test, whether the state

rule, whether it's statutory or judicial,
13

may operate, depends

1

2

on whether it's more stringent than the federal regulations.
MR. C0NF0RD:

Exactly.

But you could have state

3

common law.

4

action, there could be a state trespass action --

5

6
7

For example, there could be a state nuisance

QUESTION:

If it held up to a higher standard than

the federal statute?
MR. C0NF0RD:

The New Jersey courts could adopt

8

the standards contained in the statute and in the regulations

9

as appropriate standards for conduct in common law actions.

10

QUESTION:

Or still more stringent?

1 1

MR. C0NF0RD:

They would have to be more stringent

12

as far as pollution permits are concerned, but they could, in

13

this case, fill in interstices in the federal regulations.

14

If there were a specific situation based upon water quality

15

of a particular body of water that EPA had not regulated, the

16

State of New Jersey could do so.

17

apply in a New Jersey state court common law action.

18

QUESTION:

And those standards would

case in which the state seeks to impose a common law rule that is

21

directly governed -- say, the federal permit says, ten parts

22

and the state common law rule says --

25

C0NF0RD:

What about a

If it were inconsistent --

More strict?

More strict? If you comply

with both, by complying with state -14

1

2

MR. C0NF0RD:

It is permitted to be more stringent.

The statute expressly permits it to be more strict.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. C0NF0RD:

Even though it's the state common law?
State common law would come along if

5

there were an action for trespass, an action for negligence,

6

an action for nuisance based on water pollution.

7

QUESTION:

It would not be a defense to the state

8

common law action if there was compliance with a federal

9

permit?

10

MR. C0NF0RD:

I think so.

I think so.

The state

11

statute could not supersede, could not be inconsistent with

12

the federal statute or federal regulations except to the

13

extent that a permit could be more stringent.

14

could require a more stringent regulation, because the Clean

15

Water Act expressly permits that.

16

The state

Now, our adversaries would argue that there should

17

not be preemption in the loose sense that I've been using the

18

term preemption for the reason that all that the Clean Water

19

Act and the Ocean Dumping Act purport to do is to set stan­

20

dards but not to affirmatively, but not to constitute an

21

affirmative policy which would be impervious to a common law

22

action.

23

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting, from what you say,

24

is it possible that each of the coastal states could have a

25

standard more stringent than the federal with respect to
15

1

offshore?

2

MR. C0NF0RD:

3

QUESTION:

MR. C0NF0RD:

5

QUESTION:

6

Only as to their territorial waters.

Inside?

Not the offshore?

Inside; not the ocean.

That's three-mile limit, isn't it, along

the coast?
MR. C0NF0RD:

7

I believe so, three miles from the

8

shoreline.

9

give agencies involved in this situation, whether industrial

10

or public, time and reasonable standards, not perfection, is

11

evidenced by the fact that the Clean Water Act contains a

12

very numerous set of time regulations.

13

to be done 180 days after the statute is adopted, certain

14

things have to be done 300 days later.

15

sewerage agencies must achieve secondary treatment.

16

they must achieve what is described as the best practicable

17

waste treatment technology over the life of the works.

18

In the case of certain industrial pollutants that are particu­

19

larly harmful -- I'm now paraphrasing -- Congress has said

20

that there should be obtained the best available technology

21

achievable to result in reasonable progress to elimination of

22

pollution.

23

Evidence of the fact that Congress intended to

Certain things have

24

congressional policy not only to permit these agencies to

meet these standards, but to be given time.

Was there a previous -- prior to the enactment of

Isn't that a concept that was created by the

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I think the simplest explana­

23

tion of that language in the statute is that the citizen suit

24

provisions specifically refer to suits to enforce effluent

25

limitations.

That is the only type of suit that one might
20

1

have thought would have been.preempted by that language.

2

it seems to me reasonable that Congress used the words

"effluent limitation" again in the savings clause, just to

4

make it clear it's referring back to the original language

5

in the citizen suit provisions.
QUESTION:

Is it your position that the savings

of private rights of actions, depending upon this very

MR. H0R0TITZ:

-- preserve every single action that

Stevens correct in suggesting that until this statute came

The citizen suit provision refers to

clear that they were saving whatever there was to save.

QUESTION:

Well, isn't there some truth to what

Judge Conford said that the court more or less cast about for

21

a reason to give the State of Illinois another forum in which

22

to try its case than this one, by saying that federal common

23

law was available?

24
25

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, the court gave many explana­

tions for why it was implying

common law.
23

It didn't say

1

that this was to be applied, to be restricted only to cases

2

that could otherwise be brought under the original jurisdic-

3

tion, and the reason for finding the federal common law of

4

nuisance was because of the overriding federal interest in

5

interstate pollution;

tion.

7

they didn't say that they were doing it solely to divest

8

themselves of original jurisdiction in that case.

9

I mean, controlling interstate pollu­

I don't know what the court's reasoning was, but

The State of New York has argued in its brief that

10

the federal common law of nuisance should be restricted to

11

cases that could otherwise be brought under this Court's

12

original jurisdiction, but I don't think there's any basis

13

for that and I don't think that the reasons that the court

14

gave in Illinois v. Milwaukee support that contention.

15

I guess I'm starting to get into the second issue

16

here, and if I can just, if I could respond one more time to

17

Mr. Justice Stevens' question:

18

the best way to draft the savings clause, but I don't think

19

that the fact that they used the word "effluent" -- there is

20

a rational explanation for their use of the words "effluent

21

limitation."

22

QUESTION:

I don't think that that was

Well, the rational explanation being

23

that if there is another remedy created under this statute to

24

enforce an effluent limitation, we don't want to tamper with

25

that remedy.

And you're saying, yes, but the only other
24

1

remedy under this statute is the citizen suit provision;

2

there's no implied remedy.
MR. HOROWITZ:

3

It just seems inconceivable that

4

in enacting this detailed citizen remedy that Congress in­

5

tended to imply some other remedy without saying so, and by

6

doing it in this very mystical fashion, using the word

7

"effluent limitation" in the savings clause.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

But if you don't read it that way, that

language is clearly superfluous.

It would mean the same

thing if you just took out "effluent standard limitations."
MR. HOROWITZ:

11

The clause is drafted as broadly as

12

possible.

13

weren't taking away any other remedies.

14

may be some superfluities.

about what remedies existed, if any.

Putting aside for one moment the question

25

1

question here is whether that remedy is available to private

parties, or whether it's to be restricted to a state, the con­

text in which it was previously before the Court.
Extensive water pollution does not respect state

boundaries as it travels through the water.

Now, the Court

6

gave several examples of previous decisions where it had

7

noted that interstate pollution, both air and water, was an

8

area that touched upon a federal interest and required

9

implication of a federal remedy.

In the words of Judge

10

Friendly, "The interstate nature of the controversy here

11

makes it inappropriate that the law of either state should

12

govern." Now, given the existence of this federal common law,

QUESTION:

And will you tell me again what the

22

basis of federal jurisdiction is?

23

MR. HOROWITZ:

The basis of federal jurisdiction is

24

under Section 1331(a), because there's a federal common law.

25

The reason for the implication of the federal common law
26

1

is the need for a uniform standard to apply to an incident of

2

interstate pollution, as pollution crosses individual state

3

boundaries.

6

QUESTION:

So a federal court has iurisdiction of a

common law nuisance cause of action because of 1331?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Right.

It presents a federal ques­

tion, the federal question being under the federal common law

8

of nuisance.

wouldn't you?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I'm not seeking to overrule

Erie v. Tompkins.

19

MR. HOROWITZ: Well, no.

20

QUESTION:

22

for

But that wouldn't be 1331 jurisdiction?

That would be the other jurisdic­

tional statutes -MR. HOROWITZ:

Certainly, where a private party

23

brings a suit and there's no interstate effects, we agree

24

that the federal common law of nuisance does not apply.

25

QUESTION:

And a federal court would not have
27

1

jurisdiction, would it?

2

MR. HOROWITZ:

No, because there's no federal

3

question.

4

So a suit could not be brought in the federal court, it would

5

be restricted to a state remedy.

6

The federal common law of nuisance does not apply.

Now, I'd like to make a couple points on the pre­

7

emption argument which Judge

Conford has focussed on. First

8

of all, it is abundantly clear from these statutes that there

9

was no intent to preempt the common law of nuisance, neither

10

the Clean Water Act nor the Ocean Dumping Act.

11

both from the legislative history and from the savings

12

clause, and in the Clean Water Act the legislative history

13

specifically referred to actions that have been brought under

14

the federal common law of nuisance.

15

This is clear

Now, the other bases that are ordinarily looked at

16

for this Court for preemption, at least in the state context,

17

also do not apply here.

18

federal common law of nuisance remedy and these statutes.

There is no conflict between the

19

Similarly, the fact that --

20

QUESTION:

Why do you say that, when the federal

21

statute provides for effluent limitations and specific permits

22

and so forth, and a federal nuisance remedy could simply in­

23

volve a single federal judge saying, well, I don't think the

24

EPA or whoever it is that administers the effluent permits

25

acted with sufficient stringency here,
28

I'm going to reduce

1

the effluent limit.
MR. HOROWITZ:

2

Well, I think that's -- considering

3

the preemption clause I think it's important to draw a dis­

4

tinction between whether a cause of action for nuisance

5

exists at all and what standards are to be applied on the

6

merits in determining whether there's a nuisance.

7

Court said in Milwaukee that the standards established under

8

the federal acts will be highly relevant to determining

9

whether a nuisance exists.

Now, this

Now, if there's a permit -- and I should point out

10
1 1

that in this case the complaint alleges that the discharges

12

were in violation of permits, so there really is no defense

13

at all because of the permit.

14

that permit is relevant in determining whether there is a nui­

15

sance to the extent of what EPA considered in issuing the

16

permit.

17

If there's a permit, then

Now, what -QUESTION:

Do you think that the federal judge

18

could go beyond the permit and say, well, this permit allows

19

too much effluent and under the common law of nuisance I'm

20

going to say it's only half as much?

21

22
23

MR. HOROWITZ:

Unless he found some deficiency in

what EPA did, I wouldn't -QUESTION:

Well, isn't there a statutory review

24

provision for EPA that a person dissatisfied by the permit

25

issued can appeal EPA's actions?
29

MR. HOROWITZ:

1

Yes.

But there are gaps in the

2

statute.

The Clean Water Act does not control every kind of

3

discharge.

4

in the Milwaukee case, but there are certain aspects of

5

discharges that were not covered by --

There are certain conditions listed in our brief

QUESTION:

6

Just one question, if I may, before you

press, taking Mr. Justice Rehnquist's illustration:

1 1

not so?

12

until the circuit settled it, you'd have no uniformity.

13

Is that

Another district judge in the same circuit?

MR. HOROWITZ:

And

Well, perhaps there's a little con­

14

fusion here.

The choices, as I understand it, the municipal

15

petitioners are not arguing that there is no nuisance remedy,

16

the question is whether there is a federal remedy or whether

17

the plaintiffs must resort to a state remedy.

18

goal of uniformity is advanced by having a federal remedy, in

19

a case like this where you have pollution and pollution

20

effects in two different states as well as in the ocean, if

21

there's a federal remedy, this can all be resolved by one

22

judge in one court in one action.

So, in that sense,

You wouldn't have any uniformity until

Now.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
A brief review of the factual background of this case

23

that is submitted is helpful to a full consideration of the

24

significant environmental issues present.

25

My clients are the National Sea Clammers Associatior
31

and Mr. Gosta Lovgren, individuals who are commercial fisher­

2

men and ply their trade in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean

4

summer of 1976 there occurred what may be described as a

5

rapid and massive growth of algae in the geographic area

6

ranging from the southwest portion of Long Island to a point

7

approximately due east of the southern tip of the State of

8

New Jersey.

9

During the

Specifically, what we complain about is that when

10

this massive algal bloom died, it settled on the ocean floor

1 1

creating a condition of oxygen deficiency or anoxia in and

12

about the waters on the ocean floor.

13

a tremendous amount of death and destruction to the marine

14

and other life of the ocean, and particularly with respect

15

to the ocean bottom dwellers who were not equipped to escape

16

the blighted area.

17

As a result, there was

The impact of this algal bloom was especially dele­

18

terious since July is the normal spawning season, so it had

19

an impact not only on the existing stocks of fish and shell­

20

fish but future stocks of marine life in and about the

21

blighted area.

22

clamming-related industries were virtually destroyed.

23

As a result of this the commercial fishing/

In their complaint we have alleged that this algal

24

bloom resulted from two differing types of conduct.

25

first alleged that the City of New York and various other
32

It was

1

New York and New Jersey municipalities discharge

sewage

2

sludge and other waste materials, many of which are highly

3

toxic, into the Hudson River and New York Harbor where it is

4

then carried out into the Atlantic Ocean.
The second and somewhat different aspect of the

5

6

causal part of this problem arises from the fact that various

7

municipalities ostensibly under the aegis of the Army Corps

8

of Engineers directly dump similar materials, including very

9

highly toxic substances, directly into the Atlantic Ocean

10

where it was actually transported out by boat and by barge.

11

Of the three issues that this Court designated to

12

entertain argument on, we first present argument with respect

13

to our position that the federal common law of nuisance has

14

not been preempted since this Court's first recognition of

15

that remedy in the leading decision of Illinois v. City of

16

Milwaukee.

17

As we have indicated in our brief, there are at

18

least three arguments which we maintain compel the conclusion

19

that the federal common law of nuisance not only continues but

20

is available for my clients in this case.

21

of the two statutes, of the two environmental statutes with

22

which we are involved. The Federal Water Pollution Control

23

Act and its amendments, and the Marine Protection Research

24

and Sanctuaries Act indicate that where Congress has chosen

25

to preempt an area either entirely or partially, it has done
33

First, an analysis

1

so expressly.

To cite but two examples.

First, under the Federal Water Pollution Control

2
3

Act, as I believe Judge Conford has already noted, the Federal

4

Water Pollution Control Act has

5

a state, of any municipality within the state, or of any

6

similar agency from adopting or enforcing -- yes, sir? --

7

from adopting or enforcing any effluent standard or limita­

8

tion less stringent than that adopted pursuant to the author­

9

ity of the federal statutes.
QUESTION:

10

preempted the authority of

But can't that be read as simply preempt­

1 1

ing, federal law preempting state law and not necessarily

12

precluding federal law preempting preexisting federal common

13

law?

14

MR. CORBIN:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I be­

15

lieve they would have been much more explicit.

16

ther suggest that that provision of the Federal Water Pollu­

17

tion Control Act must also be read in conjunction with the

18

savings clause of that statute, which I believe is even

19

clearer statutory language to this Court that they did not

20

intend to preempt the rights and remedies that already existec.

21

at the time that the savings clause was enacted.

22

I would fur­

I would also submit that there is nothing in the

23

savings clause which indicates, other than perhaps the mis­

24

nomer which has been attached to it, to suggest that that only

25

reserved rights and remedies which existed as of the time it
34

1

was enacted, as opposed to the rights and remedies which woulc

2

grow out of a developing state or federal common law of nui­

3

sance

or

4

in

other' environmental areas --

QUESTION:

Well, but, in the Illinois v. City of

5

Milwaukee, the court was quite specific about stating that

6

perhaps eventually federal common law would be superseded by

7

a federal statute too.
MR. CORBIN:

8
9

I would certainly concede, Your Honor,

that that argument was made, but with respect, we would submit

10

that if that time is ever going to come, it certainly hasn't

1 1

come now.

12

statutes were enacted, at least a part of the congressional

13

purpose and design was the recognition that the previously

14

existing statutes were inadequate in a number of respects,

15

not the least of which was the fact that whereas the previous

16

emphasis for environmental protection was thrust upon the

17

states, it was determined that for whatever reason the states

18

were simply not carrying out those dictates.

19

I think at the time the federal environmental

I think that a careful reading of the provisions

20

of the two statutes, the

21

the Ocean Dumping Act, indicates that the approach currently

22

taken by Congress is to afford a full panoply of federal

23

protection, but that that protection to be provided is not

24

antagonistic but rather will be coextensive with the avail­

25

ability of private enforcement, particularly in the context

Clean Water Act and amendments, and

35

1

of this suit where you have individuals who are not just

2

claiming that the water that was polluted smelled bad, that

3

they couldn't fish or boat or enjoy other recreational activi­

4

ties normally attendant with the Atlantic Ocean.

5

businesses were destroyed.
QUESTION:

6

These men's

Well, why didn't Congress simply endorse

7

the common law of nuisance rather than provide for a whole

8

series of effluent limitations and that sort of thing, and

9

the EPA issues specific permits, and the Army Corps of

10

Engineers to permit dumping, and allow review of each of

1 1

those actions in federal courts?
MR. CORBIN:

12

I would

submit, respectfully, Your

13

Honor, that indeed Congress did endorse precisely that,

14

namely, the continued availability of the private damage

15

remedy where damages can be shown.

16

brief from the 1972 Senate report which considered the

17

Federal Water Pollution Control Act and clearly and unambig­

18

uously indicated that the private damage remedy remains where

19

damages could be shown, as indeed we maintain our clients can

20

show.

21

quirements of the Act would not be a defense to a common law

22

action for damages.

23

We have cited in our

And they also indicated that compliance with the re­

So, I think, as I attempted to indicate earlier,

24

Congress declared, took a completely different approach from

25

the earlier approach.

Yes, there would be a full panoply,
36

1

a comprehensive regulatory and statutory framework.

2

viewing the continued existence of a private remedy as being

3

antagonistic to that, as I believe my opponent has suggested,

4

Congress chose to permit that as a welcome conflict, if

5

indeed there was a conflict.

6

QUESTION:

Far from

Well, at the time that was formulated in

7

Congress, had there been any cases affirming the existence of

8

a private action for damages for nuisance in a federal court

9

invoking independent federal jurisdiction of it?

10

MR. CORBIN:

To my knowledge, Your Honor, there

1 1

had been no such cases at that time.

12

that the savings clause cannot be read to mean that it only

13

preserves rights which existed as of the date of its enact­

14

ment.

15

today, in 1981, in evaluating our case, must determine what

16

rights and remedies if any my clients had in 1972 when the

17

statute was enacted, when there Is nothing in the statutory

18

language or in the legislative history that indicate that

19

there was a time lock on a court’s analysis as to --

20
21

There is simply nothing to suggest that this Court

MR. CORBIN:

23

QUESTION:

25

Except for the misnomer, "savings clause

and you say it's a misnomer?

22

24

But we would submit

Exactly.
A savings clause ordinarily is just that

a time lock, isn't it?
MR. CORBIN:

I would agree that if it was a true
37

1

savings clause it would be that.

2

nomer, as I have phrased it, has been attached and, I believe,

3

incorrectly.

4

QUESTION:

Unfortunately, that mis­

Until this case, have there been inde­

5

pendent actions by private parties for damages for nuisances

6

invoking federal jurisdiction?

7

MR. CORBIN:

Yes, there have, Your Honor.

We cited

8

one in our brief, if I may,

the Byram River decision.

9

Yes, Your Honor, the Byram River v. Village of Port Chester,

10

a Southern District of New York decision from 1975.

QUESTION:

17

MR. CORBIN:

It wasn't a diversity case?
No, Your Honor.

The specific juris­

18

diction for the district court was under the federal common

19

law of nuisance.

20

QUESTION:

21

a federal question?

22

MR. CORBIN:

So, it was thought, there held to involve

That's correct, Your Honor.

I believe

23

I was proceeding into the second point of our argument,

24

namely, that the clauses -- I hesitate to use the word

25

"savings clauses," but for want of a better phrase at that
38

1

time, if I may be permitted to use that, the savings clauses

2

themselves and the legislative history, specifically the

3

Senate report accompanying the Federal

4

trol Act Amendment of 1972, we submit clearly and unamibig-

5

uously indicates that, yes, in a sense, these were savings

6

clauses, because they most certainly preserved all rights

7

and remedies existing as of the date the statute was enacted.

8

However, they do not have, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist

Water Pollution Con­

9

has suggested, a time lock to preclude the continued avail­

10

ability of new rights and remedies which might be developed

1 1

in the future by judge-made law under the federal common law

12

of nuisance.
QUESTION:

13
14

Isn't that an assumption, that Congress

was buying a pig in a poke?
MR. CORBIN:

15

I would not believe that to be the

16

case, sir, particularly if one remembers the history of the

17

development of this statute.

18

believe, woefully inadequate both with respect to the scope

19

of area covered as well as the inadequate remedies which were

20

provided.

21

this Court in its decision in Illinois v. City of Milwaukee

22

where there was not even a mandatory conciliation or arbitra­

23

24

pollution.

25

The previous statute was, I

Indeed, that was one of the very reasons cited by

QUESTION:

Well, in your Byram River case, supposing
39

1

there had been an effluent permit granted, and the district

2

court said, we think EPA was just all off base here, and

3

therefore we're going to cut the amount of effluent in half.

4

Now, do you think that Congress welcomed that sort of con­

5

flict when it adopted the Water Pollution Control Act?

6

MR. CORBIN:

Yes, I do, sir, and I would submit

7

that that so-called conflict, we certainly recognize it as a

8

real one, but would submit that the conflict of that nature

9

already exists and indeed my opponent urges that it continue

10

to exist.

1 1

potential conflict with respect to what we are asking than

12

the situation exists under Illinois v. City of Milwaukee where

13

in your example, if I may borrow it, sir, the judge says,

14

well, I can't award damages, but I'm going to order you to

15

completely stop dumping, and therefore be limited to injunc­

16

tive relief.

17

for conflict, is indeed welcome.

We submit that there is no greater conflict or

I believe that that

capability, that potential

18

To cite but another example, that under the Federal

19

Water Pollution Control Act the states are free to adopt more

20

stringent limitations, effluent limitations, than are pre­

21

scribed, if at all, under the federal statute.

22

QUESTION:

Well, what is the person who has the

23

effluent permit supposed to do when the district judge tells

24

him, no, you can only do half of what the EPA has told you

25

you can do?
40

MR. CORBIN:

1

Well, before that question is reached,

2

sir, I believe that there is a further safeguard for that

3

person, and that is particularly with respect to the standards

4

to be applied to determine whether something is in violation

5

of the federal common law of nuisance or, indeed, constitutes

6

a public nuisance. Though we don't believe it's necessary for

7

this Court to reach the issue, we would certainly be satis­

8

fied if this Court were to adopt the standard suggested by

9

the 3rd Circuit which, as you know, was the restatement of

10
1 1

torts,

definition of a public nuisance.
Not only must the existence of the public nuisance

12

be determined, but the comments, the official comments to

13

that restatement provision suggest that where, as our oppo­

14

nents have suggested, there is a comprehensive legislative

15

or regulatory framework which has been imposed to prescribe

16

or regulate a given conduct, the courts are especially loath

17

to describe the conduct regulated as being a violation of a

18

common law.

19

lar difficulty with a federal judge being confronted with

20

that situation.

21

So I do not see that there would be any particu­

We will frankly concede that we have, even if this

22

Court were to affirm the findings of thd 3rd Circuit, my

23

clients have a difficult road ahead of them in terms of the

24

evidentiary burdens to be overcome. We would only ask that we

25

be given the opportunity to meet those burdens at trial.
41

One other comment which I wish to address with

1

2

respect to the continued need for the federal common law of

3

nuisance.

4

authority to regulate to the extent to which it exists at

5

all on the Atlantic Ocean goes no further out than the three-

6

mile limit.

As my opponent has indicated previously, the state

We have alleged in our complaint a situation where

7

8

there is a certain degree of pollution within that three-

9

mile limit, but there is also a certain degree of pollution

10

from this algal bloom in the next area going geographically

11

from the shore, and that is in the 12-mile-limit area.

12

We submit that the only law which can apply in that

13

area within the 12-mile limit in which the states do not have

14

any authority to regulate has to be the federal common law of

15

nuisance, and indeed the geographic area, or at least a por­

16

tion thereof, which was affected is precisely one of the

17

remaining interstices in which the federal common law must

18

apply.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Corbin, may I just ask -- I under­

20

stand your common law theory, but your statutory theory, your

21

implied cause of action theory, do you allege that the

22

defendants violated the effluent limitation?

23

MR. CORBIN:

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

We -- our

24

thrust is twofold.

25

briefs, it has never been established as a matter of record,

Contrary to the assertions in some of the

42

1

and indeed we intend to plead, as we have alleged, that

2

permits under both statutes, the dumping permits under the

3

Ocean Dumping Act and the permits to discharge the sewage

4

and sludge, that those dumping and discharging activities

5

were in violation of permits which were issued as well as

6

the rules and regulations under which the permits are issued.
QUESTION:

7

MR. CORBIN:

QUESTION:

1 1

Are you still able to make those claims

Without

giving

the

60 days, or --

No, with, giving, say you did it, you
Could you still make those claims?

12

MR. CORBIN:

13

QUESTION:

I believe we could.

However, we may --

Why couldn't we have avoided the whole

14

implied cause of action issue by having you give notice a

15

couple of years ago?
MR. CORBIN:

16

Well, the difficulty with that, Your

17

Honor, as we argued unsuccessfully to the district court,

18

somewhat more successfully to the 3rd Circuit -- as Your Honor

19

may recall, the 3rd Circuit indicated that could have been an

20

alternate basis to support our federal statutory claims.

21

We filed our complaint in January of '77.

22

about which we complain, and its effect, was over by the fall

23

of 1977.

25

It was rather futile to request an end to the

QUESTION:

1

2

Oh, I see, and your 60-day -- that claim

would not be a damage claim, would it?

3

MR. CORBIN:

That's correct, sir.

And, I may also

4

add that neither of the two statutes permitted private dama.ge

5

claims.

6

Contrary to the assertions of Judge Conford that

7

what we were seeking is a broad and far-ranging sort of

8

relief, the relief which we request and which we submit we

9

are entitled to under the federal common law of nuisance is

10

going to involve a relatively small class of individuals.

11

We request this Court not to adopt the narrow and

12

overly restrictive reading of the rationale of this Court's

13

1972 decision of Illinois v. City of Milwaukee.

14

Court indicated, it was not merely the character of the par­

15

ties, the fact that a plaintiff was suing a sovereign entity

16

not within its own jurisdiction, that led the Court to apply

17

the federal common law of nuisance.

18

As that

The Court held there, and we maintain that holding

19

is applicable here, that where there are, such as here, an

20

involvement of an interstate waterway, particularly a situa­

21

tion where there is truly an interstice, or actually, a

22

vacuum, with respect to the non-application of any other law

23

other than the federal common law of nuisance, that certainly

24

the rationale of the City of Milwaukee decision remains.

25

I believe my time has ended, unless there are
44

1

any questions.
