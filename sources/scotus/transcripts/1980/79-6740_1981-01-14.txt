ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD H. SINDEL, ESQ.,

5

8

We'll hear first this

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In July of 1978 Robert Bullington filed a motion to
quash the jury panel to be commenced against him under this
Court's decision in Taylor v. Louisiana.

It was contended

at that time that the statutes constructed in Jackson County
violated those provisions In that case in

that they excluded

women unconstitutionally from the jury.
Five months later he proceeded to trial for his
life, at which time the jury came back with a verdict of
guilty, the guilt phase of the trial, and rendered a sen­
tence of life imprisonment.

18

The question now before this Court is whether or
19

not the State of Missouri can seize upon the opportunity to
20

take the reversal of that decision of guilt pursuant to this
21

Court's decision in Duren v. Missouri and resubject and resen­
22

tence this individual to a trial for his life.
23

Throughout the proceedings counsel for the defendant
24

and the defendant persisted in claiming that to proceed to
25

trial with the jury panel so composed violated his constitu­

2

tional rights.

that time contended that it would unnecessarily and needlessly

22

chill his rights to a jury trial, that it would be -- that any
sentence of death at the second proceeding would be excessive
and disproportionate to any sentence, the sentence of life at
the first proceeding, and that the statutory provisions under
which the State intended to proceed were vague and overbroad
under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sindel, what If your client had been

convicted by the jury or the judge and sentenced to the death
penalty in the first proceeding and it was set aside on the
Duren ground?
MR. SINDEL:

I think that at that particular time

23

since there had been no determination by the jury of an ac­
24

quittal or that death was not the appropriate sentence in this
25

4

1

particular case, and a jury is specifically instructed in

2

Missouri as to what they need to find.

3

existence of an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable

4

doubt,

5

weighed by any mitigating circumstances that are presented,

6

either statutory or non-statutory.

7

had obviously determined that in fact an aggravating circum­

8

stance did exist, then I think the State would not be pre­

9

cluded, because it would not be tantamount or substantially

10

They need to find the

and that that aggravating circumstance is not out­

If at that time the jury

equivalent to a verdict of acquittal.

1 1

In this particular case the State had one full fair

12

opportunity to present to the jury their version and why this

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20

21

defendant should suffer with his life.

And at this, they

presented all the evidence they wanted to, they presented all
the evidence that they had.

In fact, they have conceded that

they have no additional evidence.
QUESTION:

Does that make any difference?

Suppose

they did not make that concession, would you be arguing the
same way here today?
MR. SINDEL:

Yes, I would.

I think that the verdict

of acquittal -- I don't believe that the State can seize upon
the opportunity because of the trial court's necessary action

22

considering the Missouri Supreme Court's refusal to recognize
23

the decision in Taylor, the trial court's necessary action in
24

putting this defendant to a trial, I do not think that they
25

5

1

can seize upon that opportunity to muster additional evidence.

2

But I don't think that necessarily it makes any

3

difference whether or not there is additional evidence or

4

there is not, to the issue of double jeopardy.

5

is whether or not this defendant was placed in jeopardy, whe­

6

ther or not he went through the ordeal, the anguish of a trial,

7

and whether or not he should be subjected to that same ordeal,

8

that same anguish, a second time when a jury, unobjected to

9

by the State, a jury composed, in their opinion, I assume,

10

properly, can then render a verdict of acquittal.
There's no question in Missouri that the sentencing

1 1

12
13
14

phase is functionally equivalent to a trial.

17

18

There is no

difference in a trial in the functioning phase except for the
evidence that may be introduced.
QUESTION:

15
16

The question

if I may.

Mr. Sindel, let me ask you one question,

At the sentencing phase, the jury returned what

was like a general verdict of,

saying life imprisonment rather

than death.
MR. SINDEL:

That is correct, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

Supposing your procedure required the

20

jury to make special verdicts, and they had found that pur­
21

suant to Instruction No. 38 even though the mitigating circum­
22

stances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances, as a
23

matter of leniency we will nor impose the death penalty.
24

MR. SINDEL:

I believe that's -- excuse me.

25

6

1

2

QUESTION:

Had that been done expressly, would you

then have the same position here?
MR. SINDEL:

3

I would.

First, I would like to point

4

out to the Court that that instruction does not have anything

5

concerning leniency.
QUESTION:

6

Well, I know, but it says they are not

7

obligated to impose the death penalty even if they find in

8

aggravating circumstance

9

cumstance is not outweighed by the mitigating circumstance.
MR. SINDEL:

10

and also that the aggravating cir­

And I believe that that instruction is

1 1

consistent with this Court's decision in Lockett, wherein" they

12

say that there has to be allowance of a broad scope to the

13

defendant.
QUESTION:

14

15
16
17

18

My question is, what is your position if the jury had made it,
articulated a basis for a decision that it was pursuant to
this instruction rather than to any deficiency in the prosecu­
tor 's proof?
MR. SINDEL:

19

20
21

22

There's no problem with the instruction.

But I think that that instruction does

cover nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. As I read that
instruction, and as it is given to the jury, it allows them to
determine from all the facts in the case, not those specific
facts of aggravating circumstances or mitigating circumstances

23

but all the facts as to whether or not death is the appropriate
24

sentence.
25

7

And I think that under that instruction, if they

1

2

were in fact to return a verdict, special or otherwise -- in

3

other words, if they returned a verdict saying, we just didn't

4

find any aggravating circumstances, I think that.obviously

5

that would be without question an acquittal.

6

a verdict and they said, the mitigating circumstances as sub­

7

mitted were such that we determined that they outweighed the

8

aggravating circumstances, again that would be the functional

9

equivalent of acquittal.
QUESTION:

10

If they returned

If they find --

Mr. Sindel, isn't your position really --

1 1

why, for whatever reason the jury may have done it, they did

12

not impose the death penalty, they imposed only a life

13

tence,

14

death sentence?

QUESTION:

16
17

18

21

Absolutely.
In other words, I gather, this would be

an extension of Green, wouldn't it, if we were to agree with
you?
MR. SINDEL:

19

20

and that act operates as an implied acquittal of the

MR. SINDEL:

15

sen­

Yes, I believe it would be. Although,

in Green they talked of an implied acquittal, and I don't be­
lieve there is anything implied in this acquittal.
QUESTION:

Would, you say that it's an actual ac­

22

quittal?
23

MR. SINDEL:

It's an express acquittal.

They had

24

that choice and they came back with it.
25

8

And they came back

1

and they said, we find that the State has failed to prove

2

their case.

3

grounds, I think that it has more strength, even.

So that in terms of distinguishing on that

QUESTION:

4

Well, it is possible, isn't it, that a

5

jury, irrespective of the evidence, irrespective of instruc­

6

tions, for whatever reason, they decide not to impose the

7

death penalty?
MR. SINDEL:

8
9

10
1 1

12

13
14

15
16
17

That Is correct, Your Honor.

The jury

has complete power under the Constitution of the United States
They have the complete power to render any decisions that they
wish and that cannot be attacked.
cannot

be circumscribed

It cannot be dissected.

It

in such a way as to try and glean or

pull from that decision why it•came about.

In this particular

situation it's obvious that no matter where the determination
came from it came down, and they said, death is not the appro­
priate punishment, life is appropriate in this particular
case, with this particular defendant.
And in the same way, by examining these factors and

18

by determining that life in fact is the appropriate sentence,
19

any other sentence under this Court's decision wouldn't
20

necessarily be excessive and disproportionate; another part of
21

our argument.
22

QUESTION:

Mr. Sindel, in your answer to Justice

23

Brennan's question a moment ago you said the jury expressly
24

found that death would be an inappropriate sentence in
25

9

1

this case.

2

special verdict to that effect, or are you simply relying on

3

the fact that they came in with a life sentence rather than

4

the death sentence?

Was there a written interrogatory or written

MR. SINDEL:

5

There is no special interrogatory or

6

special verdict form that's allowed in the State of Missouri.

7

However, I think that it's clear that if a jury comes back

8

with a life imprisonment sentence, that they must have found

9

that death was in fact inappropriate.

There is very little

10

that they could have otherwise found.

The jury was death-

1 1

qualified pursuant to Witherspoon, so there's obviously no

12

people that are sitting on the jury that are so constituted

13

that they could not impose the■death penalty.

14

viduals who indicated under questioning that they could in

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

These are indi­

fact impose the death penalty in the proper case under the
proper circumstances.

The only thing that can be concluded is

that in fact this was not the proper case or the proper circum­
stances .
Now, we would also contend that any sentence other
than the sentence of life would have to be excessive and dis­
proportionate under the Court's earlier decisions.

There's

no question that the jury had the opportunity to weigh this
particular defendant and in the vital interest of the community
and the vital interest of the defendant, they determined that
the only appropriate sentence was life.

25

10

So under those

1

circumstances a retrial and allowing another jury to deter­

2

mine if the first jury was correct, and the Supreme Court of

3

Missouri dealt with this by saying, we can't say whether or

4

not the jury below was a maverick jury.

You don't really know

But if you allow, if you allow the Supreme Court of

5

6

Missouri to say that, then every time a life sentence comes

7

down, they can say, that could have been the result of a

8

maverick jury, and then the comparison test that is so vital

9

to this Court's decisions in the holding that Georgia's

10

statutes in Gregg, where they'd said that this appellate

11

review is one of the vital elements that's necessary under the

12

Eighth Amendment to insure and to guarantee both to the

13

community and to the defendant•that his rights under that

14

amendment will be respected, will be lost.
I think it's important to point out in terms of the

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

double jeopardy argument and in terms of every argument
throughout this case that it is a death penalty case, and
there's no question as to how unique it is.

This is why per­

haps Stroud and Pearce and Chaffin need to be reconsidered.
They did not provide in those cases for the strict statutory
guidelines for the sentencer's discretion.
are to

These guidelines

focus the sentencer on the particular circumstances of

22

the case in such a way that we can assure ourselves, assure
23

society, and assure the defendant

that he is getting the

24

benefit of all the constitutional rights, because it is a
25

11

1

unique penalty.
QUESTION:

2

So you're -- what about in non-death

3

cases, where, in jury sentencing, and the jury comes in with

4

a sentence of ten years and on retrial the other jury comes

5

in with a sentence of 20 years?

6

MR. SINDEL:

7

the Chaffin decision that that would be proper.
QUESTION:

8
9

12
13
14

Well, I know, but your argument seems to

me to require overruling those -- .
MR. SINDEL:

10
1 1

I think that there's no question under

I don't believe so.

two distinguishing important questions.

I think there's

First, this.Court

recognized in distinguishing -- in the Gardner case they dis­
tinguished Williams v. New York, a death penalty case, and
they say, well, we think that due process requires that there
be an adversarial proceeding and that the lawyer be disclosed

15
16

the contents of a presentence investigation.
Now, there was no overruling of the Williams case

17

because in U.S. v. Grayson that case was again upheld, and
18

they said, the court can determine from the defendant's testi­
19

mony

if they believe that he was committing perjury, and they

20

can use that, in fact, in sentencing.

So there's no question

21

that you do not have to overrule.
22

But it is perhaps necessary to reconsider the deci­
23

sions in those cases for two reasons.

One, those cases took

24

place prior to this Court's decision in Gregg, recognizing
25

12

1

how unique and irrevocable and final the sentence of death is,

2

and two, the idea that the sentencing phase of this trial is

3

exactly like a trial.

4

the introduction of evidence, and the taking of testimony.

5

There are instructions to the jury, there are arguments of

6

counsel, there is then deliberation by that jury, and a ver­

7

dict.

8
9

10
1 1

12
13
14

15
16
17

There are opening statements.

There is

This is the functional equivalent of an acquittal.

If it walks, talks, and looks like a duck, it's a duck.
There can be no question that this defendant had to
undergo the ordeals and the anxiety and the pressures that
exist at trial.

Now, this Court in Breed recognized the

existence of those pressures and that ordeal in a juvenile
court case and they said, well* then, it doesn't have perhaps
as many pressures as a situation where you're on trial in a
felony case, but it's still enough, and we recognize that
the defendant has a right to be protected for having to undergo
those ordeals again.
There can be no question, the magnitude of the ordeal

18

when you are being tried for your life, and there can be no
19

question that this needs to be protected, that the defendant
20

needs to have the protection from this Court of having to un­
21

dergo that experience again, and that the Double Jeopardy
22

Clause guarantees it to him.
23

In this Court's decision in Di Francesco there was
24

remarks concerning the finality of judgments, and we are here
25

13

1

talking about the finality of judgments, for that jury did

2

render a final decision, a final verdict, and the State had

3

their opportunity to make their case for death.

4

defendant in that case, unlike the defendant in Di Francesco,

5

had a right and was entitled to expect the finality and the

6

repose that is guaranteed to him under the Double Jeopardy

7

Clause.
And unless he is accorded that, there is no question

8
9

10

that the State can seize upon the opportunity again and again
and again.
QUESTION:

1 1

12

13

unconstitutionally constituted■to render a decent verdict?
MR. SINDEL:
QUESTION:

15

17

Well, why should you rely on, be entitled

to rely on what this jury did, when you say that jury was

16

And the

jury

There was one verdict that jury -Apparently, you think it was enough of a

for you to hang your hat on for an acquittal?
MR.

SINDEL:

Absolutely, because there is no ques­

tion that that jury was empowered to acquit.

If that jury --

18

QUESTION:

Your position was that jury was a nullity

19

MR.

SINDEL:

Excuse me?

20

QUESTION:

Your position when you asked for a new

21

trial was that in effect the jury was not a jury.
22

MR. SINDEL:

Our position was that the jury was

23

unconstitutionally composed.
24

QUESTION:

So, then, it wasn't a jury, was it?

25

14

MR. SINDEL:

1

Would there be any question in this

2

Court if we had filed our motion, in that case, if they had

3

returned a verdict of not guilty of murder, and perhaps guilty

4

of one of the other offenses, that he could then be retried

5

because we were able to obtain a reversal on that conviction?

6

I think that Green talks specifically in terms of that kind

7

of forfeiture.

8

this is a question, then, does he forfeit the protections

9

guaranteed to him under the Double Jeopardy Clause?

10
1 1

12

15
16

to lose his right to a constitutionally composed jury in ex­
change for a valid plea of formal acquittal.
I think there can be■no question in this case that
that jury was constitutionally composed only to render a ver­
dict of acquittal but they could unquestionably render that
verdict.
QUESTION:

17

18

And Green

talks specifically in terms of forfeiture, and that he is not

13
14

This is not a question of a waiver of rights,

I

take

it

you

anticipate

a

more

sympathetic jury the second go-around?
MR. SINDEL:

19

I certainly hope

for a more sympathe­

tic jury.
20

QUESTION:

Even though a harder-nosed jury didn't

21

give your man the death penalty?
22

MR. SINDEL:

That's correct.

I would -- I obviously

23

have no idea what the jury's going to be like the second time
24

around.

I obviously hope that it's a sympathetic jury.

25

15

1

I obviously hope that it's a constitutionally composed jury.
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, you'd like a second bite at the

apple, wouldn't you?
MR. SINDEL:

4

Well, I would like a second bite at

5

the apple, but then there is no constitutional provision that

6

forbids that second bite to me, but there is a Fifth Amendment

7

provision that forbids that bite to the prosecuting attorney.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, it's just -- maybe it's just an

accident that the flaw you found In your case was related to

been reversed for failure to suppress testimony secured in
20

violation of Miranda?

Would you say that the double jeopardy

21

provision barred retrial with the possibility of the death
22

penalty?
23

MR. SINDEL:

Yes, sir.

Absolutely.

24

QUESTION:

How do you reconcile that with our

25

16

1

decision in United States v. Scott?
MR. SINDEL:

2
3

Well, I -- well, my understanding is

that if there was an acquittal of any offense.
QUESTION:

4

Well, the jury convicts, an appellate

5

court reverses, because there was improperly admitted evidence

6

in violation of Miranda?
MR. SINDEL:

7

But we are not asking the Court to set

8

aside a verdict of conviction.

We are asking the Court to

9

recognize a verdict of acquittal, and that is a distinct

10

difference.

1 1

they did talk in terms but found that that was not an acquit­

12
13
14

15
16
17

18
19

tal.

In Scott they did not talk in terms of whether --

But in this particular case it has no other coloring.

It is an acquittal.

There is no question that the jury was

there and could acquit, that they had the evidence in front
of them; the State has in the beginning conceded that there is
no additional evidence.

So it's obvious that whatever evidence

they're going to present at the second trial, it's identical
to the evidence that they presented at the first trial, and
there is no reason that the defendant should have to undergo
that ordeal.

In fact, there's specific reason in the

Consti­

20

tution why he shouldn't have to undergo that ordeal.

And

21

there's no reason why the prosecution should have a second
22

bite at the apple when what we have is an acquittal.
23

We do not have the -- setting aside the conviction
24

because of preindictment delay, or because of motions to
25

17

1

suppress, or other motions that do not go to the determination

2

of factual elements of the offense.
QUESTION:

3
4

You’re the one who is asking for the

second bite, the State didn't ask for the second bite.
MR. SINDEL:

5

Well, I asked for the second play,

6

but I do not believe that by asking for the second trial I

7

waive my rights to protection under the Double Jeopardy Clause,
QUESTION:

8
9

10

down, as so many of these cases do, to the proposition that
death is different?
MR. SINDEL:

18
19

20

Counsel, doesn't your argument really get

That is one part of the argument.

There is no question that because death is different, this case
has the two elements.

One is the death, and one is the pro­

cedures and the specific statutory guidelines that had been
set up.
QUESTION:

Well, as Justice Rehnquist pointed out,

the authorities seem to be against you on most of the proce­
dural points.
MR. SINDEL:

But the authorities have never dealt

with the situation in what's been a bifurcated trial.

The jury

is given specific guidelines, given instructions, submitted
21

evidence to them, and then asked to make a determination as to
22

whether or not that evidence is sufficient beyond a reasonable
23

doubt to establish the elements of the State's case.

And I

24

think that that is the distinguishing characteristic that
25

18

1

cannot be ignored.

I think also the fact that this is a death

2

case makes it unique, perhaps the bifurcation.
The State argues that it is the bifurcation that we

3
4

say is the unique part, but it's not really that.

5

cation serves the purpose both of the State and of the defen­

6

dant.

In fact, under the statutory provisions in Missouri,
the one in which it says it's outrageously or wantonly‘vile,
horrible, or inhuman, I assume that at that they could present
inflammatory photographs that would not be relevant to guilt
or innocence and would be precluded from the trial.

Under

this particular circumstance they certainly could not come
back into court after the jury had rendered a verdict of life
imprisonment and say, wait a minute, I have some new photo­
graphs, and these photographs absolutely will convince that
jury they should return a verdict of death.

It's precluded from that.

21

QUESTION:

Well, what about the situation where you

22

have another panel of 12 jurors and this panel of 12 jurors
23

happens to believe three or four prosecution witnesses that
24

the earlier panel did not believe?
25

19

MR. SINDEL:

1

I don't believe it's a question of

2

belief or not belief in this particular case, but I don't

think that the prosecution is allowed the opportunity to again

present their case to either strengthen it or to present the

your double jeopardy contention, your client can be retried
on the same charge, but the death penalty not sought?

You don't disagree, do you, that as to

retried.

Absolutely not.

I believe he can be

In fact, I think that Justice Harlan in the Tateo

decision specifically points, and I think that is the point
that perhaps the Double Jeopardy Clause hinges on.

There has

been the talk of the continuing waiver theory and whether or
not he waives his right to the protection of the double jeo­
pardy clause.

But Harlan talks, Justice Harlan talks In terms

of the balancing of society's interests as against the defen­
22

dants' interest, and in this particular case society's
23

interest has been vindicated, it has been properly represented
24

as well as the defendants'.

And at that time society

25

20

through

1

this jury spoke and they spoke and said, this man does not

2

deserve to die.

3

I wish to reserve the balance of my time.

QUESTION:

Just before you sit down, your argument

4

would require us to directly overrule Stroud v. United States

5

and to overrule what was said, at least, in North Carolina v.

6

Pearce and other cases, wouldn't it?

7

MR. SINDEL:

I don't believe so.

I think it only

8

required that they be reconsidered in light of this Court's

9

decision in Gregg v. Georgia, recognizing --

10
1 1

12

QUESTION:

Well, Stroud was a decision directly on

this issue, wasn't it?
MR. SINDEL:

It was a decision in which the jury was

13

not presented with evidence as■to why, in fact, a verdict or

14

a particular sentence was proper.

15

And it did not involve

this either-or decision similar to the guilt or innocence de­

16

cision in a trial, at the particular trial phase, at the

17

guilt phase of the trial.

18
19

20
21
22
23
24

Stroud does not, and I believe that

the Gregg decision requires that Stroud be reconsidered in
light of that.

Stroud, individually, at that time, did not

have the entitlement to finality that this petitioner deserves
And I think that it's only a reconsideration of Stroud rather
than an overruling of the general principle there.
QUESTION:

Well, I won't take any more of your time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. COOK, ESQ.,
25

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
21

1

MR. COOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Petitioner in this case -- excuse me.

3

My name is

4

James Cook, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney for St. Louis County

5

and I represent the respondent, the State of Missouri.
Petitioner in this Court has asked this Court to

6
7

do certain things, but it is our position that if the death

8

penalty is a legitimate state interest, and if jury sentencing

9

is a legitimate State interest, and if as a general principle

10

increased sentences on retrial does not go against the Consti­

1 1

tution

12

there should be no prohibition against a State seeking the

13

death penalty in this particular case.

14

15
16
17

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

as long as we protect against vindictiveness, then

We believe that what the petitioner asks this Court
to do basically is to overrule Stroud, Pearce, Chaffin, and
Di Francesco, at the very least.
First position is that the procedure that we now
have for death penalty cases, that being the bifurcation,
makes the sentencing like a decision of guilt or innocence.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Cook, in Missouri is the jury

ever asked to specifically determine what aggravating circum­
stances and what mitigating circumstances they find present
in the case?
MR. COOK:

If they come back with the death penalty,

they must state which of

the aggravating circumstances they

22

1

have found beyond a reasonable doubt.

QUESTION:

4

If they come back with

They may have found no aggravating cir­

5

cumstances or they may have found that there were mitigating

6

circumstances that outweighed the aggravating circumstances,

7

or they just may have been merciful.

8

MR. COOK:

Right.

We don't know.

9

QUESTION:

Suppose you did?

Suppose there was a jury

10

came in and said, we find, we impose life because the miti-

Could you then

MR. COOK:

I'm not sure.

I think that on one. hand

you could say res judicata.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. COOK:

On the other hand, though, this Court has
23

1

approved the statutory theory of Florida which is that even if

2

the jury doesn't find the aggravating circumstances, the

3

judge can.

So I think that -QUESTION:

4

So you're relying mostly, then, on the

5

fact this is a general verdict, and the jury just might have

6

been merciful?
MR. COOK:

7

I don't want to say I'm relying on that

8

but I do assume that.

9

dure alone does not make this into a decision like -QUESTION:

10

_

What I'm relying on is that the proce­

Well, if you assume that the jury imposed

1 1

life because they found there were no aggravating circumstances

12

you have a problem about pressing the same aggravating circum­

13

stances,

14

I would take your case as not so clear either if the jury said

15
16
17

18

there are both aggravating and mitigating circumstances, but
the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circum­
stances and the State on retrial says, we're going to present
precisely the same evidence.
MR. COOK:

19

20
21

22
23
24

if you just assumed that that's what the jury did.

Right.

I believe my position is easier

because of the way the jury system is set up, the instructions
under the general verdict type of approach to the specific
verdicts.

But I think that you still need to look at the

policy behind why we apply double jeopardy.

the truth by having your day in court and making sure on

say that in a way of vindictiveness.

We don't

We say that to emphasize

the fact that it is only the defendant that can set aside a
conviction.

And of course he wouldn't be interested in setting

aside an acquittal.

So that when you would take this policy

and you try to apply it to the sentencing procedures, or sen­
tencing at all, as was recognized in several of the recent
cases, it doesn't apply.

Because you have said, or this Court

has said that there's no absolute bar against increasing a
21

sentence.

The only concern we have against increasing a sen­

22

tence is to protect against vindictiveness.

And we say, in

23

a judge sentencing situation, we have to do that by adding
24

the Pearce limitations, but in the jury sentencing situation

we don't have that concern.

There is not that concern about

this into an acquittal.

finality than it ever had before.

QUESTION:

Bifurcation is for the protection of

Mr. Cook, suppose the statute said that

you can be guilty of first degree murder and second degree
murder, which I assume you have in Missouri.

1 1

MR. COOK:

Yes, sir.

12

QUESTION:

And if you're convicted of second degree

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

22

murder, you're acquitted on first.
MR. COOK:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

In Missouri?

MR. COOK:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

So why isn't it automatically true that if

you are found guilty of life imprisonment you are acquitted
as to death?

When you boil it down, that's what they're argu­

ing, isn't it?
MR. COOK:

Yes, sir,

I think so.

It's -- that ar­

gument certainly has been made by members of this Court here
and I just think that it is, when you look beyond that argu­

23
24

ment, behind it, you see that there is a distinction between
differences in sentencing and differences in offenses --

25

26

QUESTION:

1

Well, what would be the difference if

2

they said that you can get life for one or 100 years for the

3

other, and it was the degree was used?

4

you'd go with' the first, wouldn''t you?
MR. COOK:

5

6

I think you have to look at what that is

entitled and what is -~
QUESTION:

7

8

It still would be -

But is the language really important or

what happens is important?

9

MR. COOK:

What happens.

QUESTION:

The jury said, this man shall not be

MR. COOK:

That's right.

QUESTION:

In the first hearings?

MR. COOK:

Yes, sir.

And, but he was again put in jeopardy as

to whether he should be killed or not.
MR. COOK:

Because --

QUESTION:

Right?

MR. COOK:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

That's correct, so.

MR. COOK:

If -- well, that's not correct.

he was not put in jeopardy about being killed again.

You see
He is

22

put in jeopardy -- he's never lost jeopardy or he was put in
23

jeopardy again when his case was -24

QUESTION:

What do you mean, he never lost jeopardy

25

27

1

when the jury came in?

2

MR. COOK:

Well, that is true if you assume, Mr.

3

Justice Marshall, that jeopardy applies to sentencing.

4

don't think that that is what this Court has said in the past.

5

QUESTION:

And I

I didn't -- mine was just hypothetical,

6

was that it had -- it wasn't sentencing, it was degree of

7

crime.
MR. COOK:

8
9

10

I see.

Well, If the degree of the crime

is different, then, yes, jeopardy would have attached and he
would not be able to be charged with that.
QUESTION:

1 1

But then after he -

Well, if Missouri says, if you killed

12

somebody with aggravating circumstances, you are subject to

13

conviction of first degree murder and death.

14

guilty of homicide without those problems, you are guilty of

15

second degree murder and sentenced to life.

16

with me?

If you are

Right?

Are you

17

MR. COOK:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

And the jury brings in a second degree

19

verdict, life.

Can you try him again on first degree?

20

MR. COOK:

No.

21

QUESTION:

So the only difference is words?

MR. COOK:

No.

22
23
24

25

I see what you're saying and I

think that this Court has rejected that argument.

There is a

difference between sentencing and the offense, and although
death is unique, certainly, and the fact that the death penalty
28

1

is available on one case certainly makes it unique, I think

2

that there has been this historic distinction made between

3

what you call an offense and what you call a sentencing.
QUESTION:

4

5

I hope you realize that my hypothetical

didn't say anything about limited to death.

6

MR. COOK:

I understand.

7

QUESTION:

Right? ■

8

MR. COOK:

Yes.

9

QUESTION:

We're together that far.

10

MR. COOK:

Petitioner mentions that death is unique

1 1

therefore that is one of the reasons why this Court can

12

distinguish this case from Stroud, or certainly, Pearce and

13
14

15

16
17

18
19

20

Chaffin, and Di Francesco, even.

I would suggest that, and

agree, that that is unique, that the death penalty is very
unique and this Court has bent over backwards, perhaps, to
put out extra special procedures for making extra care that
the death penalty is only imposed in certain specific situa­
tions.

But the uniqueness of death does not allow it to change

the basic rules of law called double jeopardy and due process
and equal protection, and that is what petitioner asks you to
do, and asks you to say as far as Stroud and Chaffin and

21

Pearce that in all cases except death penalty cases double
22

jeopardy means thus-and-such, but in death penalty cases it
23

means something else.
24

I don't think you can do that, because I think that
25

29

1

whittles away at the underpinnings of the whole legal system,

2

which is the Due Process Clause, Double Jeopardy Clase.

3

other matter that -QUESTION:

4

The

Incidentally, I gather your colleague

5

argues not only the Double Jeopardy Clause but Due Process,

6

doesn't he?

1

7

MR. COOK:

I think so; yes.

8

QUESTION:

And what's your response to that argument

9

MR. COOK:

I think the Due Process Clause comes in

here under the vindictiveness issue.

1 1

understanding in the Pearce case.

12

QUESTION:

Only?

13

MR. COOK:

I believe'so.

14

QUESTION:
sometimes?

17

18
19

20

Certainly that was the

But we worry about vindic­

tiveness as it applies to the sentencing by the jury --

15
16

'1

And sentencing by jury doesn't apply then

I mean, Pearce doesn't apply to -QUESTION:

That's Chaffin v. Stynchcombe.

MR. COOK:

Yes, Pearce does not apply because it's

a jury sentencing and that's Chaffin and that's indicated
that the concern that caused us to set the limits.
QUESTION:

And you don't think the concept of death

21

being

unique

makes

this

a different kind of due process

22

claim?
23

MR. COOK:

No.

I think that this Court has histori­

24

cally in applying due process made sure that certain procedures
25

30

1

are followed, that certain laws not be allowed to take away

2

the defendant's due process, but it did not change due process,

3

which is what I think you have to do to make an exception for

4

the uniqueness of death.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Cook, hasn't the State of Missouri

6

itself taken the view that death

is

'different

by

setting

7

up a special procedure for imposing the death penalty?

8

MR. COOK:

Yes.

9

QUESTION:

So, would it be necessarily undermining

10
1 1

12
13

the entire legal system to say that the rules with respect to
capital sentencing are somewhat different as a constitutional
matter from the rules for lesser sentences?

16

And that's cer­

tainly implicit in the Gardner■holding, isn't it?
MR. COOK:

14

15

I think so.

Yes, sir, I think that raises it perhaps

too high, that it raises it above the constitutional proce­
dures .
QUESTION:

17

Do you think it's perfectly clear that

the Di Francesco holding will apply to death cases -- to death'1
18

MR. COOK:

I think that the underlying assumptions

19

and findings in the Di Francesco can apply too, yes; recog­
20

nizing that sentencing is different,;and whether that be a
21

sentencing concerning death or not does not make any differ­
22

ence here.

Certainly in other situations and in the proce­

23

dures that we follow and the safeguards that we set up, it
24

does make a difference.
25

31

1

QUESTION:

To put the question more directly, sup­

2

posing Missouri had a procedure that if the jury does what it

3

did in this case, find no death penalty is appropriate, would

4

it be constitutionally permissible for the State to say, well,

5

there shall be an appeal to an appellate court which could

6

reverse that determination and decide that, well, we think

7

there should be a death penalty, evidence of aggravating

8

circumstances are pretty strong, and so forth?
MR. COOK:

9

I think so, because I think that's what

10

you have in Florida, where you have what is called an advisory

1 1

jury opinion.

12

would allow a state legislature to just call something advisory

13

when in fact it is a jury determination of finding of death or

14

life.

15
16
17

18
19

20

21

But certainly I wouldn't think that this Court

And certainly, in that situation, the judge can over­

rule it.

Now, there are certain procedural safeguards.
QUESTION:

What about a procedure that said, we'll

have a bifurcated hearing except that if the jury finds no
death penalty we'll have a second jury empaneled and have them
take another look at it and have a trial?
be permissible too.

I suppose that1d

To just specifically say, the State shall,

have two chances to persuade someone that the death penalty
is appropriate?

That's, I guess, what they have in Florida.

22

MR. COOK:

Well, sort of.

QUESTION:

Would you think that would be permissible

23
24

constitutionally?
25

32

1

2

MR. COOK:

It doesn't sound good, but I don't know

the details.

3

QUESTION:

It's consistent with your position.

4

QUESTION:

You would have exactly the same issue as

5

6

you Iiave in this case, wouldn't you?
MR. COOK:

Well, then, you could -- I don't think so.

7

It really doesn't sound very good, though, because, you see,

8

the difference, the difference, I think, is that in this

9

case -- in that case it is the government saying, aha, we want

10

two shots at --

1 1

QUESTION:

Well, here it's the prosecutor.

12

MR. COOK:

No, it's the defendant.

No, it's the prosecutor who's filed

these aggravating circumstances -MR. COOK:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

And is going to ask for the death penalty

again, wants to.
MR. COOK:

That is correct.

But it is the defendant

who has at his own behest wiped the slate clean and allowed
the sentencing to again come before the jury. And I think
that's an important distinction again, not because of being
vindictive to the defendant and saying, you can't have your
cake and eat it too, and by golly, you asked for it.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that true in the case

25

33

1

I told you where you were acquitted on first degree, but con­

2

victed on second degree?

3

degree, can you?

You can't try to rescind it on first

4

MR. COOK:

That's correct.

5

QUESTION:

So, I mean, it's the same thing here.

6

QUESTION:

Even though the defendant wiped the slate

clean, you couldn't try him again.

17

20
21

22
23
24

you have authority to support you.
MR. COOK:

I think so; yes.

The other issues pre­

sented by the petitioner include the disproportionate and
excessiveness, which I'd like to address briefly.
It's argued that on one hand a sentence at the
second trial of death would be automatically disproportionate,
and the Georgia Supreme Court has so held.

I argue that

that is just, I don't feel logical, in that I don't think it
was what was anticipated by the drafters of this

legislation

nor by this Court when it approved the comparison of one case

2

with other similar cases.

poor people; or, to protect against the aberrant jury.

It was a prior kidnapping while

21

armed offense, and a prior armed robbery offense.

And there

22

were other nonassaultive offenses also.
23

QUESTION:

And it's conceded that the aggravating

24

circumstances that will be filed will be identical this time,
25

35

1

and that the evidence will be virtually identical, isn't it?
MR. COOK:

2

It's conceded that the aggravating circum­

3

stances are identical.

4

evidence on this issue than it was allowed to the first time

5

in that we were only allowed to read to the jury the stated

6

offense, as opposed to giving the jury any of the facts of that

7

case which would allow it to make a determination of whether

8

it was a serious assaultive conviction or not.

9

trial court decision that we're going to try to change the

10

13
14

15
16

I don't

19

think

disproportionateness applies, and

excessiveness is also mentioned.

I don't think that applies

either, again for the same reason as I've indicated in the
Proffitt decision where a death sentence following a life
cannot per se be excessive.

It may be, but you have to look

at more than just the one other case.
There's a concern here that this decision would

17

18

But that's a

trial court's mind on.

1 1

12

The State will attempt to present more

chill the right of the defendant to seek a jury trial in his
second case, and of course the petitioner relies on the Jackson
decision.

It's our position that this Court has cited that

20

issue in respondent's favor in Chaffin where, although it is
21

concerned about that, it felt that those difficult decisions
22

sometimes have to be made.

And it distinguished Jackson, in

23

that in Jackson it was stated that there was no other purpose
24

or result of that procedure than to chill the defendant's
25

36

1

right to a jury trial.

It's our position that there is another

2

purpose or result in this procedure, and that is the stated

3

and approved government, or State interest, in having jury

4

sentencing, and that as long as you have jury sentencing, and

5

as long as that is considered a legitimate State interest,

6

then that is a legitimate State purpose or result.
Also, I would indicate that although Petitioner indi­

7

8

cates that the defendant would be absolutely precluded from

9

getting the death penalty if he waives his jury, that is not

10

necessarily so, because he relies on the fact that he would

1 1

then come under the Pearce provisions and the judge could not

12

give death unless something new had arisen.

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20

21

But I don't

think that we would ever be absolutely sure of that until the
moment of sentencing.

I'm not implying that anything new has

arisen which would cause the judge in this particular case
to give the death penalty but for the Court to find that
this chilled his right because he would be absolutely precluded
from getting the death penalty by the judge would not be
accurate, because there may be those cases where the judge
could in fact give the death penalty.

So the decision is not

the decision as it was in Jackson.
Petitioner also asked this Court basically to rule

22

that the two aggravating circumstances here are too vague and
23

overbroad.

And the Missouri court has ignored this Court's

24

rulings about the narrowing of the aggravating circumstance
25

37

1

that was decided in Godfrey. And certainly that is one of the

2

circumstances we're using in this case.

3

out that the decision below in the Missouri Supreme Court

4

was handed down before your decision in Godfrey, that the

5

Missouri Supreme Court has not had the opportunity to decide

6

any death penalty cases yet and has not had the opportunity

7

to follow this Court's decision, and so we would ask that this

8

Court give the Missouri Supreme Court the opportunity to

9

constitutionally narrow those aggravating circumstances.

10

Thank you.

12

Well, you're using the term acquittal

SINDEL:

That is one part of it, and that the

procedure used to obtain the sentence of death is different
as well.

I think that this is one of the reasons that

Di Francesco needs to be overruled and this Court needn't

concern itself with overruling the Di Francesco case.
In fact, in oral arguments in that case, Mr. Frey

who so ably represented the U.S. Government indicated that

this was a question of legal air.

5

about whether or not there's legal air.

No, but is it central to your due process

MR. SINDEL:

I believe so.

I think Beck v. Alabama

I also believe that in applying death, it says that

6
7

to apply the death penalty in the Beck case, there must be

8

this elevated procedure that is followed, and there's no

9

question that it has to be followed under the Eighth Amendment

10

prescriptions.
I think that in Di Francesco the argument that was

1 1
12

presented is consistent somewhat with Professor Westen's

13

argument in his article that's■quoted there, "The Triptych

14

of Double Jeopardy," the idea that there are three things

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

22

that Double Jeopardy Clause is to protect, the finality of
jury verdicts of acquittal, the lawful administration of
sentence, and third, the expectation of finality or repose
that exists in the defendant after he has undergone the ordeal
of trial.
I would suggest that if you use the Wayne technique
that Professor Westen suggests, and also we cite to a new
article that he has written in our supplemental brief,
distinguishing Di Francesco, in which he talked specifically

23
24

about this case, that argument would hold water, and that
Di Francesco needn't be distinguished as well as Stroud and

25

41

1

Pearce needn't be overruled to sustain a decision in this

2

particular case that Mr. Bullington need not undergo the or­

3

deal of a trial again.

4

The prosecutor has indicated --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SINDEL:

You mean the death sentencing procedure?
That's correct.

The prosecutor has

7

indicated that at the second phase of the trial he looks to

8

go into perhaps the facts surrounding the alleged serious

9

assaultive convictions.

These are 13-year-old convictions

10

that the defendant had prior to this trial.

1 1

is somewhat indicative of the problems --

12
13

QUESTION:

If -- if we agree with you on the retrial

which will go forward, will the jury do the sentencing?

14

MR. SINDEL:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SINDEL:

17

QUESTION:

18

I think that this

Yes.
And is there more than one -Yes.
Is there only one sentence it could

give if it finds him guilty?

19

MR. SINDEL:

20

QUESTION:

Of capital murder; right.
So it has no -- there's no discretion?

21

If you win on retrial and if he's found guilty, there can only

22

be one sentence?

23
24

25

Right?

MR. SINDEL:

But if there were a mandatory sentence

-- yes, that's right -- if there are mandatory sentences, it
would be the same result.
42

QUESTION:

1

2

Well, at the first trial they imposed a

life sentence but then something about a 50 years?
MR. SINDEL:

3

The provision under the statute is that

4

he is to be sentenced to

5

and parole for a period of 50 years.
QUESTION:

6
7

life without provision for probation

But that’s statutory, that wasn't the

jury's verdict?

8

MR. SINDEL:

9

QUESTION:

In essence he's buried.
So on retrial, if you win, there will be

10

no need to present to the jury any evidence whatsoever with

1 1

respect to sentencing?
MR. SINDEL:

12
13

If I win there there will be no need either.
QUESTION:

14

17

18
19

No, no, but if you win here on retrial?

MR. SINDEL:

15
16

If I win here there will be no need.

If he

were to be found guilty of

capital murder, then there would be only one available sen­
tence .
QUESTION:

Well, there wouldn't be a separate sen­

tencing proceeding at all?
MR. SINDEL:

There would be no need to because

20

there would be only the one available sentence.

QUESTION:

Exactly.
