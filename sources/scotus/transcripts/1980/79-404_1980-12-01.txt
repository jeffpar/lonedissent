MRS. ETKIND:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may

That

the front part of the sole containing 8 forward-pointing

V's and the back, the heel, contained 4 backward-pointing V's.
The Chevron design appeared to be the lead print in
each group, and Border Patrol officers in the area concluded
that a person, whom they called the Chevron, was guiding groups
of aliens across the Mexican border and north to a pick-up
point on Route 86. In fact, a group of illegal aliens that
were previously apprehended had. identified Respondent Hernandez-Loera as the wearer of the Chevron-soled shoes and as the
man who was to guide them to meet a smuggler off Route 86.
Border Patrol officer Wayne Gray, who participated
in the stop of Respondents' camper on January 31st, himself
had tracked the footprints from mile post 119 to mile post 122

15
16

on January 4th, and

all the way from the Mexican border to

mile post 122, on January 16th.

From the physical attributes

17
18

of the footprints, the officers were able to make several
deductions.

They concluded that Chevron traveled on or near

19

weekends, that he and the

aliens he

led walked in dark­

20

ness, from shortly after beginning their journey;, that it took
21

them from 8 to 12 hours to reach the highway, and that they
22

were met there by a camper, van, or similar vehicle that could
23

hold a large number of people without arouding suspicion.
24

officers also knew that overland border crossings generally

reversed the finding of the District Court.

22

the question of founded suspicion as the Brignoni-Ponce test

Have we not said in some opinions, in
good many courts of appeals, that in

MRS. ETKIND:

I think that's right, yes.

In any

20

event, the question is not whether all of the factors listed

21

in Brignoni-Ponce are present, but whether the totality of

22

the circumstances gives rise to founded suspicion.

23

connection, this Court emphasized that any number of factors

24

may be taken into account, but each case must turn on the to­

25

tality of its particular circumstances and that in all

In that

situations the officer is entitled to assess the facts in
light of his experience in detecting illegal entry and
smuggling.

highest caliber which should be encouraged and not disparaged

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARDO P. VELASCO, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT HERNANDEZ-LOERA

8
9

MR. VELASCO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

10

This case presents a question that centers upon

11

whether a vehicle may be seized simply because it travels on

12

an east-west highway and returns to the direction from which it

13

came.

14

of circumstances is that this behavior or this exhibited con­

15

duct is sufficient to lead to the rational conclusion that

16

a crime or criminal activity was taking place.

17

The government suggests to the Court that the totality

The Supreme Court, in dealing with reasonable sus­

18

picion cases, has adopted the term reasonable suspicion.

19

Ninth Circuit, after the Brignoni-Ponce decision came out and

20

several other cases, stated that they had been using the

21

founded suspicion test or doctrine, but that in fact was

22

equivalent --

23

QUESTION:

iThe

Actually, in Martinez -Fuerte, the term

24

is that rational inferences from those facts that reasonably

25

warrant suspicion, is it not?
17

1

MR. VELASCO:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

And again, if you want to make fine

3

points about distinctions, you consider that slightly differ­
4

ent than reasonable suspicion?
5

MR. VELASCO:
6

The Ninth Circuit

has said that it's the same thing.

7
8

Founded suspicion?

The manner in which any seizure

by a police officer

is evaluated, is done by the Court, because the Court has a

9

very important function in these types of cases.

clearly has the obligation to view the matter through -- in
light of the officer's experience.

23
24
25

However, the reasonable

suspicion test requires specificity and objectivity.

If the

Court must look at the evidence and must analyze it objectively
to determine whether the officer's experience and observations
are reasonable.

If the Court is not to look at this objec­

tively and specifically, then what you have simply is the
Court accepting any rationale by any police officer, which theifi
would eliminate the Court's function in Fourth Amendment cases
and would in fact preclude any assertion that the officer's
conduct is unreasonable.

MR. VELASCO:

11
12

13

15

And the problem

is that when the -- all the defendant needs to do is show a
prima facie -- some showing that the search is unreasonable,
where there is no warrant and clearly there has been no warrant
obtained in this case.

And we submit to the Court that under

the facts in this case, it's clearly established that the
government had to go forward with proof to justify the seizure.
And I don't think it's apparent --

9
10

Yes, that's correct.

QUESTION:

Well, supposing there's been no warrant

and the government is operating on a theory that there was
founded suspicion or whatever one wants to call it, the
defendant claims there is none.

Now, when that evidence

is tendered into evidence, it's up to the defendant to
object and to make clear the objection, is it not?

It's not

up to the government to show why it should go in evidence.

16

MR. VELASCO:

Yes, yes.

But there's nothing, as

I see it, in this case, there's nothing which the government

QUESTION:

Well did the defendant object in the

trial court on Fourth Amendment grounds?
MR. VELASCO:

Yes, Your Honor.

So what we have in

this particular case, is the Court has various decisions
regarding this problem.
The Court has said that you simply can't stop the
vehicle or a person, you can't stop the vehicle because it's
on the highway, you can't stop a Mexican simply because he's
in a vehicle, you need something more.
QUESTION:

The Court --

Couldn't the government, by statute or

regulation, or the Bureau, declare that any vehicle over 5
tons, 4 tons, within 25 miles of the border or 15 miles of
the border, should be stopped and searched?
MR. VELASCO:

I don't believe so.

If the state

were to pass a law like that, the Court would strike that down
as an undue burden on interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

Well how do the states then get by, to

use the vernacular, with having these pull-off areas and
requiring every truck over a certain tonnage to stop to be
checked and weighed?
MR. VELASCO:

The Court has

taken

the position

22
23
24
25

that those types of intrusions are made as a regulatory matter
that the public has the ability to know that if they are
driving these types of vehicles that there will be these
21

1

checkpoints.

Every person driving these vehicles is subject

2

to seizure, every person knows that a certain seizure will

take place.

ways of looking at this.

the Court has -- has two

The seizure is whether there's spe­

cific and objective facts justifying the seizure of a partic­
ular individual, and then the Court has also suggested, or
certain areas where discretion of the officers is limited,
where the policy decisions for stopping vehicles has been made
by persons higher in the government, the discretion of the
officer in the field is limited so that he may not make -stops at night simply because he has a belief that criminal
activity is occurring and

has a belief that that criminal

activity is connected to the vehicle.
This Court has already rendered decisions where
23

1

simply being in an area is insufficient to justify seizure.
2

Certainly, a proposition can be made that in Ybarra v. Illi­
3

nois, that simply being in bar where there's probable cause
4

to'believe that the bar has narcotics, that person is not
5

subject to seizure.

He's there.

In Sibron, the Court said

6

merely talking to drug addicts is insufficient to justify

seizure.

So, --

8

QUESTION:

But In Ybarra nobody was on the move,

9

the people were simply standing around the bar.

This is a

10

case of crossing a state line.
11

MR. VELASCO:
12
13

In this case, let me make an even

closer case then, that would be -- in this case there's no
crossing a state line.

A similar example would be,

as in

14

Brown v. Texas, where an individual was coming out of an area
15
16
17
18
19

20
21
22
23
24
25

of high incidence where he had been seen with another person
and that isn't sufficient. What we have in this case, we don't
have the vehicle in the area, no reason to believe from look­
ing at the vehicle that it's been in the area.

We have a

vehicle, we can't stop it because it's a vehicle -- you can't
stop it if all you've got is the vehicle in the area.

The

government now suggests that if the vehicle is suspected
without more

of

going into the area, it's not enough.

And

that clearly can't be the test, because then the next thing thejt
happens is, any

vehicle driving north can be seized, any

vehicle -- just, on the record here, really, there is no basis
24

1

to rationally conclude that the seizure was justified.

did suggest maybe they were picking up astronomers or some­
thing like that, but at this hour of the night it's not
totally without reason to assume it has some connection, is
it?
MR. VELASCO:

Well, it's not reasonable to seize

13

the person, but it might be a basis for focusing suspicion.

14

Clearly, if you look at something and you say well that's

15

strange, then the Court considers well, officers are entitled

16

to look at things and decide if they are strange.

17

t:hen becomes

something beyond their suspicion.

and if it's going to have 20 people in it, that should have an

13

that cannot be correct, if you try to evaluate the evidence

and the totality of circumstances, there comes a point as

the Court has recognized in Reid, where simply looking at

Appeals was required to give to the findings of the District

20

Court in a case like this?

MR. VELASCO:

The Court, the Ninth Circuit has

22

adopted the clearly erroneous test, where the Court, the lower

23

court makes findings.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well that's the standard of Rule 52(a),

that's the Ninth Circuit.
26

MR. VELASCO:

But even as

-- even with the record, at the best that the government

states it,

11

there is a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and a

MR. VELASCO:

Well of course.

But if this seizure

had resulted in the seizure of some other group of aliens,

the Court would look at this and say they've had

You began

by talking about the person with the burden of persuasion,

9

the burden of proof, the person who has the burden of proof.

10
11

Who do you think that is?
MR. MINKER:

I think basically, in the practical

12

day-to-day experience of the District Courts, the Defendant who

13

has been seized

14

says I have been seized without a warrant, my constitutional

15

rights have --

16
17

without a warrant, simply comes forward and

MR. MINKER:

Yes.

That's what happens.

Generally, when the government seeks to

22

introduce evidence, or proposes to introduce evidence, accordin CT

23

to whether it's a motion to suppress or objection to the intro­

24

duction of evidence, the person who makes the motion to suppres s

25

or the person who objects to the introduction of the evidence

CO

29

has the burden, doesn't he?

MR. MINKER:

QUESTION:

MR. MINKER: Well, all you really do is make the

That is correct.
Not the government, not the prosecution?

5

motion, the prosecution, as happened in this case, the tran­

6

script clearly shows the government proceeds on to make its

7

case, the government started its case, the government called

8

its witnesses Agent Rayburn and Agent Gray and the other

9

agent and this is what happens in all of these cases.

So

10

once the defendant raises the issue in the District Court and

11

says there has been an unreasonable search or seizure in

12

violation of the Fourth Amendment --

13

MR. MINKER:

put a sensor at milepost 122, the agents talked about a culvert.

9

Well, you put another sensor there.

They, if they are going to

There is talk in the transcript

Well, a sensor could have been placed at

You also

Now you have something.

10

But more important than all of this, you go to milepost 122.

11

If the agents are so sure, even though there's been no activ­

12

ity for two weeks, they have not looked for a track in two

13

weeks, they haven't heard of any alien smuggling in two weeks,

14

they have not had a tip from an informant in two weeks about

15

aliens coming over.

16

we talked about before, in Clark you have a tip, in Clark you

17

have an area one mile from the border.

18

going from that area.

19

agents are 27 miles away, the car goes by them and comes back

20

and that is the key factor.

These are trained agents, they

21

could see a license number.

Well I submit to you, if they can

22

see a license number, these trained agents who are expecting a

23

vehicle to pick up 8 to 20 aliens -- 8 to 20 aliens is 1500

24

to 3000 pounds; a simple pick-up, camper, if it goes by and

25

they can see the license number and if it comes back and they

And when you compare that with Clark that

You have a car seen

We don't khow where this car went; the

35

1

can again see a license number, they are pretty close to that

2

vehicle.

3

there are a myriad of cases saying -- where you take other

4

things into account, the lowness of the vehicle is important.

5

Well if these agents had seen the vehicle riding low, that

6

would have indicated to them that there would have been an

7

added weight in the hour and a half that they had seen it.

8
9

It is going to be riding significantly lower.

QUESTION:

Or that it wasn't equipped with shock

absorbers that could be pushed up.

MR. MINKER:

That can be done.

But the Ninth Circuit

has held riding low is indicative, gives a basis for a stop.
QUESTION:

Now when, take that episode now, down

19

and back in 90 minutes,

20

the officers drew from that and all the other circumstances,

21

was reasonable or was it irrational, or totally unfounded?

MR. MINKER:

do you say that the inferences which

maybe they should do it your way, but we have to deal with it

they drew from this round trip in 90 minutes were unfounded?

MR. MINKER:

But do you say it was -- the inferences

Those inferences do not, in and by

10

themselves, do not equal a founded suspicion.

That wasn't my question.

They are a

MR. MINKER:

QUESTION:

16

MR. MINKER:

Do not equal a founded suspicion.
And you say that's not --that's irrational?
I say that is not founded suspicion.

I

17

do not say the agents acted irrationally; they had, done certain

18

things, no question there was some good police work done here,

19

but as the Court said in Price, they had a good hunch, but they

20

have to do more than a hunch and at the same time, they have

21

to minimize .the intrusion on travelers of the road.

22

set yourself up 25 miles down the road, well, next time

23

it could be 50 miles or it could be 5 miles, there are

24

no limits here.

25

the Ninth Circuit said it, in its opinion, if you

And to

I think this Court has to say and I think

37

1

are going to intrude on what may well be innocent travelers,

2

then you have to minimize the people who are going to be

intruded upon and you have to limit the area, the scope of the

area.

And in this case, the scope of the area, if the agents

watched, then there would be no innocent travelers basically,
who could be interfered with, because they would be knowing
the people would be going to milepost 122, because they'd
watch them, and then if the aliens took off in their truck, th 2y
could pull them over.

QUESTION:

So, what your complaint is, they should

have stopped more vehicles, not less?

MR. MINKER I beg your pardon.

That is not what we

are saying.

5

virtually any vehicle on the highway can hold 8 to 20 aliens

-- the agents so testified to that.

7

if they have a gut feeling, any large vehicle, any camper,

any motor home, any mobile home, any type of vehicle whatso­

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. ETKIND:

8

With respect to the interference to

9

innocent travelers, just to clarify it the only vehicle that

10

was stopped during that entire five-hour surveillance period

11

was the Respondents' camper.
In response to the point of why the officers didn't

12
13

station themselves at milepost 122, as we mentioned in our

14

reply brief, the officers were responsible for surveilling also

15

the Altheim Valley,

16

and 286, and that's where milepost 149 is located.

Amendment is a test of reasonableness and it is not a test of

the officers should have followed.
