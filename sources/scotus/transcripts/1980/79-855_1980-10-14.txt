ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. WALLACE:

8

We will hear arguments

Mr. Justice Brennan and may it please

the Court:
In this and the next case to be heard the Court of

9

10

Customs and Patent Appeals reversed the rejection by the

11

Patent Office, including the Patent Office Board of Appeals, of

12

the patent claims at issue.

13

lieve that the cases are controlled by this Court's interpre­

14

tation of Section 101 of the Patent Act, in Parker v. Flook,

15

which was decided in the 1977 term, and because the Court of

We sought review because we be­

Customs and Patent Appeals' rejection of that interpretaion of
the Patent Act in favor of a different explanation of the
result reached by the Court in Flook has put the Patent Office
in an obviously difficult position with respect to the thou­
sands of pending patent applications involving computer pro­
gramming .
Before getting into the specifics of this case, I
would like to say, up front, that we do not regard the inter­
pretation of Section 101 of the Patent Code adopted in Flook
to be an appropriate subject for reexamination by the Court

change if it sees fit to do so, and indeed there has been sig­

4

nificant congressional activity in this area since the Court's

decision.

This is a statutory interpretation, authorita­
It's a matter that Congress can

The Patent Office, which is the administrative

6
7

agency directly affected, has been following this interpreta­

8

tion for a matter of more than two years now.

9

no member of the Court would reexamine an interpretation of a

And ordinarily

10

federal statute subject to congressional change after it has

11

been authoritatively decided by a majority of the Court.
The fact that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals

12
13

has persisted in differing with this interpretation is not, in

14

our view — and I say this with all respect to that court --

15

is not in our view a reason for a different approach with

16

respect to the stability of a statutory precedent in this

17

Court.

QUESTION:

Do

you

think

that the Court of Customs

and Patent Appeals declined to follow Flook?
MR. WALLACE:

I think it has differed with the inter­

pretation of Section 101 that this Court adopted in Flook.
QUESTION:

Well, it didn't -- at least it didn't

purport to depart from Flook.
MR. WALLACE:

It has a different explanation for the

result in Flook, which brings about -4

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

Different from yours; different from yours
Different from ours, and different --

Not necessarily different from ours.
Well, this is fairly debatable.

Well, that's what this case is about,

isn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

But the Court of Customs and Patent

8

Appeals has written at some length about why it thought that

9

the Court's reading of Section 101 in Flook was erroneous.

10

It's not a difference that is without basis on the pages of

1 1

their opinions.

12

I don't want to belabor the point.

13

point that if as we view the matter this would not be an

14

appropriate subject for reexamination in the absence of this

15

difference.

I believe the Court is familiar with this and
I do want to make the basic

I don't think that the fact that the Court below

more subject to reexamination.

I think that that would send a

message to the lower courts that would be unfortunate for con­
sistency in the administration of the law.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Both courts are bound by the meaning

of Congress in Section 101, are they not?
MR. WALLACE:

Of course, Mr. Justice.

As I said,

the Court has written on that meaning in Flook and Congress is
23

now actively considering what changes if any to make in the
24

patent or copyright laws, and I'll get into the details of that
25

5

1

subsequently.

2
3

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I didn't understand the

Respondent to ask us to reexamine Flook.

4

MR. WALLACE:

I don't believe that has been put to

5

the Court.

No one has asked the Court to overrule Flook.

6

The arguments that are being made are, it seems to me, incon­

7

sistent with the ratio decidendi of Flook, and that is what I

8

refer to as the Court's interpretation of Section 101.

9

Nobody is asking that the holding be overruled.

The Court of

10

Customs and Patent Appeals has been very meticulous in follow­

11

ing that holding, but based on a different explanation from what

12

I regard, what we have regarded as the ratio decidendi of

13

Flook in the interpretation of Section 101 of the patent laws.

14

Now, in this case, to get into the specifics of this

15

16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

case, the Board of Appeals, as we understand Flook, applied the
Flook test to the claims at issue and examined the claims at
issue in light of the rationale adopted by this Court in Flook.
And under Flook, as the Board of Appeals viewed this, if the
claims recite a scientific principle, idea, concept, formula,
or phenomenon of nature, then that basic tool of scientific anc
technological work, as the Court called it in the Benson case,
should be assumed to be within the prior art.

And then, what

remains must be analyzed to determine whether it is novel under
Flook's reading of the Morse case and others.
If one prefers one can say, then the claims as a

25

6

1

whole should be examined, assuming that scientific principle,

2

formula, et cetera, to be already known.

QUESTION:
of the Act?

MR. WALLACE:

5

6

Isn't "novelty" covered by another section

dissenting opinion in Flook.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. WALLACE:

9

That was precisely the position of the
Novelty is covered --

Well, it's true.
-- by Section 102 of the Patent Code.

It is.
QUESTION:

10

Dissenting opinions, as I was taught in

11

law school, are subversive literature; nothing more or less.

12

But that much is true, that novelty is covered by another

13

section of the patent laws.
MR. WALLACE:

14

15

It certainly is.

Section 101 also uses

the word "new," however.
QUESTION:

16

Mr. Wallace, is it that the remainder of

17

the application is to be examined to determine whether there is

18

novelty or to determine whether anything else novel is claimed?
MR. WALLACE:

19

20

accurate one, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

21
22
23

And that's why the dissent -- that's a

point the dissent missed in Flook, isn't it?

And in Flook it

was conceded the only novel thing was the formula.
MR. WALLACE:

The latter formulation is the more

That is true.

III this Court.

2

Board of Appeals, I think quite rightly, thought it was its

3

duty to determine whether there is any novelty being claimed

4

other than in what must be assumed under Flook to be within the

5

prior art.

6

the conclusion was that the only contribution, as the Board

7

put it, the only novelty inhered in the program, the computer

8

program, that was a part of these claims.

9

in our briefs and our reply briefs, there was an examination

However, .whether contested or conceded, the

11

the Patent Office, a patent that had been issued to Coulter

12

and an application by Carre, in both of which all of the

13

diagrams save the ones at the very end were reproduced by the

14

respondent as part of their claim.
The Coulter patent, indeed, is an example of the kind

15

16

of patent that has been issued on computer hardware.

17

the briefs suggest that our position is that such patents can't

18

be issued,

19

that are valid and can be issued.

And, in analyzing these in detail, it was seen that
all that was left as a contribution was the program, although
respondents contend otherwise before this Court.

I think this

is adequately set forth in our brief and reply brief.
In light of those findings, there were three possible
bases, as we see the case, for distinguishing of Flook and

25

8

1

for reaching a different result from Flobk.

2

those are,’ in our view, unpersuasive.

3

And all three of

The first is that this application involved a machine

4

claim rather than a process claim such as was involved in the

5

Flook case.

6

ference is a passage from an opinion by Judge Rich in the

7

Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.

9

point.

The first thing I want to mention about that dif­

It's in a case called "Application of Chatfield,"

10

which is cited in the briefs; it's 545 F.2d, and at page 160

1 1

he points out in his opinion, based on the experience of that

12

Court and of the Patent Office:
"Given an invention which is in essence a new pro­

13
14

gram for a general purpose digital computer, a competent

15

patent draftsman can readily define the invention as

16

either a process or a machine or both.

17

demonstrated time and again by the computer program cases
which have come to this Court."

18

We have another similar quotation from the same judge

19

20

in our brief, on page 22.
This is not, as we regard it, a difference of sub­

21

22
23
24

25

This has been

stance in the claim or a difference of inventive contribution,
but basically a difference in the draftsmanship of the applica­
tion.

And indeed the fact that the application is put as a

machine claim rather than a process claim, if anything raises
9

1

possible additional impediments to the granting of the appli­

2

cation because of the cases we've collected on page 17 of our

3

brief, in which this Court has consistently held that a claim

4

describing the inherent operation of a known machine is not

5

statutory subject matter.

6

capable of executing the program that respondents have devised

7

was predetermined by the design of the machine itself, and

8

the inventor of that machine should hardly be excluded under

9

the patent laws from uses of the machine which were inherent

Obviously, whether the machine was

10

in the operation that he built into the machine, which is

11

really what's involved here.

12

As we further point out, there is also the problem

13

that allowing this as a new machine claim would extend the

14

life of the patent on the machine through a new machine claim

15

that essentially just describes one of the inherent operations

16

of the machine.

24

This is not a matter that's wholly irrelevant

to what the respondents have

—.

put into the case in this

Court, because page 1 of respondents' brief starts off, in
their statement under the heading, "What the invention is":
"The Respondents' invention is one of a series of
inventions which collectively define an entirely new
computer machine

which is now being commercially

marketed worldwide as the Honeywell Series 60, Level 64
computer."
In essence they're saying that the life of the

25

10

1

of the Coulter patent is extended by this additional machine

2

patent if it were to be granted.

3

And we have also addressed in our reply brief the

4

possibility of a doctrine of transitory novelty

5

ticular selection put into a player piano or a particular

6

letter or a memorandum inserted into a word processor that

7

hasn't been in the word processor before -- you know, those

8

machines that are replacing typewriters in offices -- would

9

transform the machine for the moment into a new machine.

where a par­

This

10

has never been a doctrine recognized under the patent law and

1 1

would have the same drawbacks, the same inconsistencies of

12

established law as I have dscribed.
A second possible basis for distinguishing Flook,

13
14

equally unpersuasive in our view, is that the claim here in­

15

volves firmware, so-called, rather than software.
QUESTION:

16

Well, is that the same, Mr. Wallace -- is

17

this patent only on the firmware module?

Not merely the firmware but the claim

QUESTION:

6

Mr. Wallace, under your previous argument

7

which you had just left at the time Justice Brennan asked you

8

that question, would an electric typewriter not be patentable

9

because of the existence of a typewriter that you punch by

10

keys under 101?
MR. WALLACE:

1 1

I don't think the previous patent would

12

necessarily preclude a patent there, because you're dealing

13

with a different machine.

14

under 101 in that instance.

15

there'd be a lack of novelty because the -QUESTION:

24

I don't think it would be precluded
It might be that the only, that

But then, that would be under another

section.
MR. WALLACE:

Probably under another section.

I haven't really given thought to that particular question, but
that isn't what's involved here.

Here we have the same hard­

ware and the same arrangement of hardware and making use of one
of the inherent uses for which it was designed and of which
it's capable.

That's quite a different question from yours,

it seems to us.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, you do then concede that the

25

12

1

patent claims the words "data structure" describe a machine?

2

MR. WALLACE:

Well, this is the argument being made

3

by the respondents.

4

Government said that the claims do, are written in a way to

5

describe a machine.

6

transferring the information, but they’re written in the form

7

of claiming the machine, the familiar machine, the conventional

machine, as a program to perform this process.

I can describe it.

12

briefs and all, and this is one term, a rather important term,

13

that doesn't seem to be included in any of the glossaries.

There are all sorts of glossaries in the

MR. WALLACE:

14

I don't know of any accepted meaning

15

for it.

16

It's really a more common use than solving mathematical

17

problems of the kind that was involved in Flook.

18
19

20
21
22
23
24

25

Data processing is the most common use of computers.

The examples

given by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals are typical
of that, reproducing a page of the Milwaukee phone book or a
court opinion.

This is data processing, and in a sense a

computer is a data structure.

I don't know that anything more

than that is meant by it.
Now, the fact that the claims here involve firmware
rather than software seem to us of no legal significance.
The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals itself said that
13

1

firmware may be likened to software.

2

volved here is a microprogram that fits into the control unit

3

rather than the kind of program that fits into the main memory

4

storage, so that then the microprogram, like an ordinary

5

program, consists of a series of sequential steps to be

6

carried out through the ordinary mathematical functioning of

7

the digital computer; but using them in a microprogram in the

8

control unit, that enables the programmer to have a so-called

9

macroprogram in the main memory and he can, by throwing that

All that is really in­

10

one switch, or giving that one instruction, that will set off

1 1

the series of sequential steps that have been put into the

12

control unit in the microprogram.

13

and it doesn't seem to us or to the Court of Customs and Patent

14

Appeals to be a difference of legal significance.

15

That's the only difference

Then the third possible basis for distinguishing

16

Flook and the one that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals

17

has in fact been relying on in the post-Flook cases is an

18

attempt to limit the holding in Flook to computer programs de­

19

signed to solve mathematical problems.

20

Our submission is that this is basically an illusory

21

distinction and indeed one that doesn't fit in with the rea­

22

soning of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals itself, in

23
24

25

its own cases, because a digital computer is designed solely to
perform mathematical computations.

Any program that makes use

of it is necessarily mathematical in nature, regardless of
14

1

whether it's designed ultimately to find the solution to a

2

mathematical problem or for the more common purpose of data

3

processing.

4

of the deviser of the program does not depend on whether the

5

program is designed to solve a. mathematical problem dr to do

6

And indeed, the skills and contribution required

the data processing.

7

The examples given by the Court of Customs and Patent
8

Appeals in this case, reproducing a page of the Milwaukee
9

telephone directory or a particular court opinion, seem to us
10

examples that require less of a contribution, less of an
1 1

inventive contribution from a programmer than was involved in
12

Flook, where, after all, a new formula was devised to calculate
13

the alarm limits.
14

Whether the particular inventive contribution varies,
15

depending on the nature of the data processing to be done or
16

the nature of the mathematical problem to be solved -17

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

you're ready.

22

MR. WALLACE:

23

I have stated why, in our view, each of the three

Thank you, Mr. Justice Brennan.

24

possible bases for distinguishing the Flook case is unpersua­

25

sive, and those arguments are elaborated in our briefs.
15

1

I just want to briefly inform the Court of the

2

legislative developments in this field, currently.

3

24 of our brief we refer to a bill that was introduced last

4

March by Representative Kastenmeier, a bill entitled, "The

5

Computer Software Copyright Act of 1980."

6

that time has been favorably reported by both the House

7

Committee on Government Operations and the House Judiciary

8

Committee, but has not yet gone to the House floor, although

9

it is anticipated that there will be floor action with

10

On page

That bill since

respect to it during the session right after the elections.
There has not yet been activity in the Senate, but

1 1

12

the significant thing, as we see it, is that the congressional

13

activity is focusing on copyright protection rather than

14

patent protection, which would protect the deviser of computer

15

programs.

16

present copyright law and this would just be a clarification.

17

But it would afford protection to the deviser of programs

18

against plagiarism, against the copying of the fruits of his

19

labors, but still would not preclude others, would not exclude

20

21
22
23
24

25

Arguably, this protection already exists under the

them from the inherent uses of the machine if they through
their own labors want to devise a program to process similar
data in a similar way -- for instance, reproducing the Milwau­
kee telephone directory.
There may be a basis for a congressional judgment if
that is a more appropriate form of protection.
16

1

I would like to reserve the balance of my time.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, can I ask one question before

3

you sit down?

With respect to your third, your response to

4

the third arguable distinction of Flook, namely, that Flook

5

should not be limited merely to mathematical formulas produced

6

by some software, is it your view of the patent claim which

7

is in Judge Rich's opinion — it describes four separate means

8

of describing this data structure -- that that description of

9

a first, second, third, and fourth means is in effect a

10

description of a computer software program, and that that is

1 1

what they're seeking to patent?

12

I must .confess I have some difficulty understanding

13

the claim and I'm not quite sure where in your view of the case

14

the program is claimed by the patent.

15

16
17

18

20

21

MR. WALLACE:

Well, in our presentation in this Court

we're not going back to the claims ab initio, but we're rely­
ing on the findings of the Board of Appeals that while the
claims are cast as a claim on a machine, the only thing new in
the claims in light of the prior art is the microprogramming
to be inserted into the control unit.

This is based on the

fact that the claims reproduce in detail and rely on the prior
art of the Coulter and Carre applications.

And we think that

is the posture in which the case comes to this Court.

The

Court of Customs and Patent Appeals did not disagree with the
Board's findings with respect to where their claim of novelty

25

17

1

inheres, and I think it would just be a distraction to try to

2

reanalyze the claims ab initio.
QUESTION:

3

Well, Mr. Wallace, this gets back, I guess,

4

to the question I asked you, wasn't it, earlier?

5

regard this patent as simply on the firmware module.

6

broader than that.
MR. WALLACE:

7

You don't
It's

The claims are put more broadly, but

8

that is where the novelty inheres in the claims.

That's where

9

the claim of novelty inheres under the findings of the Board.
But that's never been passed on, I thought 9

10

QUESTION:

1 1

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the Court of Customs and Patent

12

QUESTION:

Now, Your Honor -Was there software available before your

invention for reinitializing particular models of machines?
MR. PRASINOS:
QUESTION:

Yes, it was; yes, it was, Your Honor.

Well, that's the kind of software that

would be analogous to your invention, I guess?

Yes, Your Honor.

This is the type of software that would do that.

QUESTION:

Is there some particular rule applicable

different from the rules that pertain to every other kind of

industry?
MR. PRASINOS:

What he can get it is when he clothes it with

the hardware, the combination of elements.

Out of the myriad

of combinations that are possible -QUESTION:

When a machine is a combination of ele­

ments, the mere fact that one element is the law of gravity or
the operation of the law of gravity does not make the machine u npatentable per se, does not make a machine ineligible under 101
That's your point.
MR. PRASINOS:

That's right.

In Flook, as a matter

of fact, this Court stated in essence that the conditions for
patentability are that it falls under one of the categories

25

25

1

of 35 U.S.C. 101.

3

Two, it is manmade; three, it has not

QUESTION:

Right.

But that -- if you're looking at

it as a whole, as a combination one element being an unpatent­

5

able element, there nevertheless in the other element must

exist some novelty.
MR. PRASINOS:

7

8

Your Honor, there is not novelty

involved in 35 U.S.C. 101.
QUESTION:

9

I didn't say that.

I didn't say that.

10

But even though having an unpatentable element in it doesn't

disqualify, nevertheless you have to have -- the novelty in

You have to have the novelty in the other

MR. PRASINOS:

15

No, Your Honor.

Your Honor, it's

16

just like

17

Fleming's valve, which was identical to Lee De Forest's

18

arrangement, and all Lee De Forest inserted is a piece of wire

in between.

25

Lee De Forest had the -- first of all, he took

Now, that piece'.of wire, you can say, may not be

patentable, and there was no novelty in that piece of wire.
However, when you inserted it in there and biased in a certain
way, that made those elements cooperate and function in a man­
ner never before known and really what it

did is introduce

the whole electronic industry.

24

the difference between a machine and a process, as I understand
you?
MR. PRASINOS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Supposing a patent application said in

substance as follows, we have a new machine.

The thing that's

new about it is that it will use the formula described in the
FLook case.

That's the only thing that's new.

We've got a

machine that uses that formula and all the other elements are
well known.

Would the fact that it was a machine take it out

of the Flook case?
MR. PRASINOS:

I can't visualize that' particular

situation, but I would like to say --

2

QUESTION:

Say that had not been a prooess claim but

3

they'd said, we have a computer programmed to solve this equa­

tion, updating our alarm limits and all that, and the only

5

thing new about it is it has this particular program on the

6

machine, and we're asking for a patent, on the machine as

opposed to the process.

MR. PRASINOS:

I think the decisions of this Court

If it's a manmade machine that has not always

10

existed, it certainly would be eligible for consideration

1 1

under the other statutes of novelty under 102 and 103, Your

12

Honor.

13

QUESTION:

You'd say that if the precise invention

14

described in the Parker v. Flook case had been described in

15

terms of a machine which will do these things instead of a

16

process, then it would have been

MR. PRASINOS:

patentable subject matter?

No; no, Your Honor.

I am not saying

that at all.
QUESTION:

So then the distinction between a machine

and a process can't be critical?
MR. PRASINOS:

The distinction is that a process,

Your Honor, changes something to a different state of thing.
QUESTION:

Well, a machine can do that too.

MR. PRASINOS:

Yes, but, for example, a process, you

take steel, you take iron, you heat it to a given temperature,
28

you put it in cold water, that changes it to a different state

Your Honors, it is only by this mistaken and somewhat irra­

there is a program involved.

This Court need not decide any

broad policy questions regarding computer programs.

There is

no computer program involved.
As this Court articulat>ed, such policy decisions are
to be reserved and addressed by Congress.
Your Honors, it is submitted that the .Commissioner
is seeking a per se rule to have for his own administrative
convenience, to have a program per se held as unpatentable

MR. WALLACE:

In the joint appendix in this case, on

pages 99 through 120, are reproduced the diagrams that accom­
pany the application, and which I think can quickly be referred
to to show what it was that was being claimed.
The diagrams on pages 99 through 119 were all repro­
ductions of those in the prior art and in the Coulter patent
and Carre application, the Coulter patent having been assigned
to Honeywell, which is also the assignee of this claim.
The ones claimed to be novel, the ones added, are
