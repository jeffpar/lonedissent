Mr. Lee, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

6

MR. LEE:

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The issue in this case is the constitutionality

9

10

of the acreage based electoral system of the Salt River

1 1

Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District.
Salt River Project is today, and it always has

12
13

been, a federal water reclamation project.

It's first owner

14

and operator was the United States of America.

15

River Valley Water Users Association, which is a private cor­

16

poration organized under the laws of the Territory of Arizona,

17

was formed in 1903 as the entity which could perform the

18

statutory function of guaranteeing the repayment into the

19

reclamation fund of the initial costs advanced by the United

20

States.

21

the United States in the initial 1904 contract between the

22

two was the commitment that the only beneficiaries of the

23

Project's water storage and development activities would be

24

the landowners, who had subscribed their lands into -- member­

25

ship in the Association.

The Salt

One of the obligations imposed on the Association by

And that obligation, imposed on the
3

1

Association by the United States, is still in effect.

2

that from the beginning, the benefits of this Project have

3

been proportionate to land ownership.

4

So

In 1917, the role of the Association changed from

5

guarantor to operator and for the next 20 years the care,

6

operation, maintenance and control of the Project were vested

7

in this private corporation.

8

brought into being by the landowners of the Association as

9

an agricultural improvement district, which under the laws

10

of the state of Arizona, is a political subdivision of the

11

state.

12

In 1937, the District was

Prior to the creation of the District, the Asso­

13

ciation and its members had experienced severe financial

14

difficulties and the primary purpose of the District

15

to give the Project a better interest rate on its bonds by

16

making that interest tax-free.

17

the District has changed in several ways.

18

important of those changes, for present purposes, are two:

19

the first is that

20

District and Association have remained the same, the number

21

of people living in those boundaries has increased so that

22

the number of landowners entitled to use the water stored

23

and developed by the Project, as well as the number of elec­

24

tric customers, has increased.

25

was

Over the decades, since 1937,
And the most

though the physical boundaries of this

And the second change is reflected in a pair of
4

1

statutory amendments in 1969 and 1974, through which the

2

Arizona legislature has significantly increased the extent of

3

small landowner influence in the election to board of direc­

4

tors.

5

acre limitation as a condition for the franchise, and the

6

1974 change expandedthe board from 10 to 14 with the further

7

provision that those four additional members of the board of

8

directors would be elected at large, on a one landov/ner/one

9

vote basis.

The 1969 change eliminated the formerly existing one

But even more important than how the District has
changed is how it has not changed.

It still serves raw

water to the same lands, the number of persons benefitted has
changed but its purpose and function have not.

The Arizona

Supreme Court has held and the parties to this case have
stipulated that the primary purpose of the Salt River Project
is today and always has been, the storage, development and
delivery of raw water for the benefit of those landowners
who were willing to risk their property in order to bring it
into existence.

Now the Appellees take a different view of

the significance of these changes in the number of people
served by the Project.

They contend that the significance

of this increase in population is that the District has
effectively been converted into the equivalent of a city.
And they refer, for example, to the District's city-like
status and have asserted that it has all the attributes of
5

1

sovereignty.

to their position.

Court.

25

Because the Arizona Supreme Court has ruled, and I'm

quoting, "that the District's function is purely business and
economic and not political and governmental, and that it's
limited governmental attributes have been conferred for the
purpose of better enabling it to function and accomplish the
business and economic purpose for which it was organized."
The significant point is that this pivotal issue is
an issue of Arizona law, out of the entire panoply of
governmental powers and governmental functions that any
entity might have, the issue is how many are enjoyed by this
creature of Arizona ldw, this Agricultural Improvement Dis­
trict.

And the answer has been supplied by the Arizona

Supreme Court; only those incidents of public-ness, of
governmentalness, that are absolutely essential in order to
enable the District to perform its proprietary business
economic activities.

What this case really involves is state

encouragement of private investment in water reclamation.

23
24

The second is that it is squarely incon­

sistent with controlling holdings of the Arizona Supreme

12

13

The first is that this view is absolutely essential

Which, I submit, is a most appropriate endeavor
for an

arid state like Arizona.

But it's our position that

there's nothing in the United States Constitution that says
6

1

that Arizona can't do that.

2

is the thrust of this Court's decision in Salyer v. Tulare

3

Lake Basin Water Storage District.

QUESTION:

And we also believe that that

There's nothing in the Constitution that

says Arizona can't do what?

I didn't quite hear you.

MR. LEE:

water reclamation.

8

in seeing to it that water reclamation be carried out.

9

what it has done through these statutes is to encourage pri­

And

10

vate investment in that water reclamation by assuring that

11

those who make the investment will be entitled to keep the

12

fruits of their investment.

13

QUESTION:

And the principal way by which Arizona

14

has done that is by making this a governmental entity, is

15

that --

16

MR. LEE:

By making it a governmental -- well, it

17

makes it a governmental entity for the purpose of making

18

its -- for very limited purposes -- and the very limited pur­

19

pose, as the Arizona Supreme Court has said, is in order to

20

allow it to carry out its

21

economic objectives are to permit it to generate some income

22

which in turn can be used for reclamation purposes, in order

23

to conserve, store and deliver water.

24
25

QUESTION:

economic objectives.

Now, its

It had the power to condemn before this,

didn't it?
7

1

MR. LEE:

By virtue of Arizona statutes, Justice

2

Stewart, ARS, Section 121111, virtually any entity in the

3

state of Arizona has the power to condemn.

4

QUESTION:

And Mr. Lee, does the state regulate the

5

rates charged for electricity in any way, directly or indir­

6

ectly?

7

MR. LEE:

No.

The Secretary of the Interior does

8

have the power to review and revise those rates.

9

has the power to regulate in other ways, but our position on

The state

10

that is that there is nothing in the Constitution, again, that

1 1

says that the state must set the rates for any entity that

12

performs a public function, a public-type function, a public

13

service function, such as electricity.

14
15

QUESTION:

rates of private utilities, doesn't it?

16

MR. LEE:

QUESTION:

18

The state does regulate the electric

That is correct, that is correct.
And under the existing legislation,

could the state regulate the rates of this District?

to which you allude.

But the most important point is the one
And that is, that the state legislature

has a very active interest in the activities of this District
precisely because its numbers are large.

Seventeen of the

QUESTION:

Hr. Lee, I think you said earlier that

10

whether or not it may regulate rates, there are other respects

1 1

in which the state may regulate --

12

MR. LEE:

Yes.

Power plant siting, for example,

13

is subject to regulation; its bonds are subject to periodic

14

review, it is subject to the Public Utilities Regulatory

15

Policies Act, which

16

QUESTION:

17
18

is a federal act -Bonds are subject to periodic review in

what sense?
MR. LEE:

By the Arizona Corporation Commission

19

which is the same entity which sets the rates for private

20

corporations.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. LEE:

Is that the issuance or terms or what?
The statute doesn't specify, in fact,

23

it has been matters related to the bonds that have been

24

reviewed by the Arizona Corporation Commission.

25

that I want to make is that the real significance of this

Powell, your opinion for the Court said in San Antonio. School

3

District v. f- the closing line, in the Rodriguez case, is

that these are the kinds of matters that ought to be left

to the legislature and to the democratic pressures of those

who elect them.

that it is in the -- of the United States Constitution --

or it can be done by initiative.

17

19

That is correct, proposed by the legis­

lature, but voted on by the people at the following election.
QUESTION:

18

To amend the state constitution, it has

to be proposed by the legislature and then voted --

14

16

is what Justice

QUESTION:

population

QUESTION:

And then you are arguing that it's

easy?
MR. LEE:

Well, it is certainly, Justice Marshall,

20

not the task that it has been to amend the United States -- to

21

amend the United States Constitution.

22

there, and as this entity becomes more and more open-eyed,

23

so also do the Democratic pressures of those who elect the

24

elected legislators increase.

25

But the mechanism is

And the other point to make is that over the years,
10

1

though the rates have not been subject to regulation by

2

the Corporation Commission, neither have they been excessive.

3

They have always been comparable to the rates set by Arizona

4

Public Service, which is the other public utility operating

5

within the same general area.

6

says regulation is expensive and it's -- it takes.time.

7

is nothing in the -- Munn v. Illinois said that the state has

8

the power to regulate entities affected by the

9

est if it chooses to do so.

And there is nothing that
There

public inter­

Munn v. Illinois nor any other

case has said that the state has an obligation to impose
such regulation.

And if the state wants to say, all right,

we're going to have one entity whose rates are set and another
entity whose rates are not.

And then we're going to monitor

it and see if there are any abuses.

And it observes that

over a period of 40 or 50 years there have not been abuses,
then there is no reason for judicial management, judicial
regulation, under the aegis of constitutional adjudication,
to upset that kind of arrangement.
QUESTION:

Then Mr. Lee, what kind of governmental

powers does the Project exercise now?
MR. LEE:

The Supreme Court has said only those

that are absolutely necessary to enable it to carry out its
business purpose.

It is, it has the power to tax but has

never exercised it, and it never would because it is con­
tractually obligated to ask the Association to impose its
11

1

acreage assessment power instead of the taxing power.

2

bonds are tax-exempt.

3

And that's about it.

Its

Now it's true that it has the

4

power of eminent domain, but so does Arizona Public Service

and so does Sears, as -- under the laws of the State of

It really gets much closer, indeed we say that this case

And that brings us back to this question of the

1 1

between this case and Salyer are in the increased numbers of

had a virtual hammerlock over the entire corporation; an

19

election wasn't even held for 23 years.

20

people who live within this District really control the

21

legislature, and if they want changes they can have them

22

made.

23
24

25

And the only significance in the increased numbers

QUESTION:

In Salyer, you had one corporation that

By contrast, the

Salyer did not involve the generation

of electricity?
MR. LEE:

That is correct, that is correct.
12

It

1

did not involve -- they had the power to do it but they did

2

not do it.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LEE:

Did not.
And in our view, the only significance

there is simply that that's the way that they make the money

that makes the reclamation --

QUESTION:

are there in this case?
MR. LEE:

9
10

320,000, I believe.

11

QUESTION:

12

And how many electric utility customers

There are over 3 0 0,000.; there are about

And how many beneficiaries of the -- how

many voters -MR. LEE:

13

How many voters?

The technical answer

14

to that is around 210, around 220 thousand, in the sense of

15

acres that are voted.

16

portions of acres so that people may -- may vote fractions of

17

acres.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. LEE:

20

Now some of those are broken down into

How many people are voters?
Well, I'm not certain that I know the

answer to that question, but it would be more than -QUESTION:

21

Well how many, do you know how many

22

votes -- you must know how many votes were cast in the last

23

election?

24

MR. LEE:

I do know that.

What were

And --

-- well, I suppose I should

ask your colleague, and I will -- what remedy he had in mind?
MR. LEE:

Well, I think I can answer that.

His

brief says, and we agree in this respect, that in the event
that the Ninth Circuit were to be affirmed, we think that
it ought to go back to the Arizona legislature.

Could you tell me what remedy the Ninth

Of the total eligible --

MR. LEE: Of the total eligible voters.

7

8

Total, .number1 of people entitled to vote?

But that, in itself, demonstrates why it ought not
be affirmed, because the Arizona Supreme Court has already
made its judgment as to what the answer ought to be in this
case.

And these matters, the issues that are involved here

in this case, are really fundamentally economic, and resource
allocation issues.

They are issues like how extensively

should the state permit nuclear fossil fuel generation.

How

heavily should the states be involved in flood control and
should any flood control responsibility be vested in a
14

1

project whose mission is to conserve water rather than to

2

get rid of it?

3

Those are the kinds of decisions --

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Before you leave the point,

you said there were about 300,000 customers.

About 15 percent.

Thank you.

The case is similar in this respect to the

San Antonio School District case where the majority of this
Court pointed out that what was really involved in that case
more basically than equal protection, were matters of fiscal
and economic policy, which lie within the responsibility and
the expertise of state legislatures rather than this Court.
And the same is true here, as is very apparent from the amici

are matters that lie within the prerogative ultimately of
the Arizona legislature and if there are

changes

that need

to be made in that respect, the changes can be made.

And

that -- excuse me -QUESTION:

Are you saying that under the Arizona

constitution the legislature could forbid all nuclear power?
MR. LEE:

Oh, I think so.

I think so.

would lie within their police powers.
QUESTION:

They could do the same with fossil fuel?

HR. LEE:

QUESTION:

I think that is correct.
But you're not saying, I gather, Mr.

Lee, that the Arizona legislature could transfer the voting
power from the landowners to the electrical consumers,
are you?

MR. LEE:

I'm not sure, Justice Brennan.

I've

thought about that one; it does raise serious constitutional

8

questions.

Because the Court has held in

10

the United States v. Vuitch and many others, that in those

MR. LEE:

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And some way -- if your opponent is

20

right, all members of whatever class it is are entitled to

equal right to vote, whether they are all consumers or all

22

residents or all property owners; don't we have to know what

23

the

24

theory of the violation is and won't that dictate

the remedy?
MR. LEE:

I've been searching for the theory of the

it said?
I think that what the Ninth Circuit

said was exactly what the Plaintiffs are saying, as I under­
stand them, that because of the changes in size that the
District has taken on a different kind of function that has
made it something like a city.

And for that reason, we treat

it like a city, unlike the situation in Salyer -17

1

2

QUESTION:

Well wasn't it any more specific than

that?

MR. LEE:

What it said is, that these functions

4

have acquired an independent significance of their own, and

5

I have to read it -- I have to read that into that -- I am

6

not --

7

8
9

QUESTION:

What functions? What functions?

Supply­

ing power and developing water?
MR. LEE:

Yes, yes sir.

And I say that that is in­

10

adequate for this reason:

1 1

decisions of this Court, starting from the state legislature

12

that if you look at the -- the

end of the spectrum, it has come as far down into the total

13

complex of state and local governmental entities as the

14

general governing body of a county in Avery, of cities and

15

school boards.

16

as to which the -- which this Court will defer to the legis­

17

lative judgment, it has come as far as water conservation dis­

18

tricts. Now the one distinction,

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Starting from the other end, those entities

the thing that distinguishes

the School Boards in that respect is that this is -- that is
the only instance in which this Court has applied the Reynolds
v. Sims rationale, to an entity that does not exercise general
governmental power, that is, such as a city or a county
that has general power over an entire geographic area.

The

reason that school boards are distinctive is because of the
nature of the function that they perform.
18

This Court said in

1

Brown v. Board of Education, and later in Rodriguez, that

2

today education is possibly the most important function

3

of state and local government.

central

5

the function?

6

is such a function, but it squarely held, if you look at the

7

It is true that for the past 5 years no

general obligation bonds have been issued, but I am advised
-- you see, revenue bonds can be used only for the electric
service side, and there have been rather severe flood damages

that the general obligation bonds may have to be issued again

Of course not.

QUESTION:

Which would trigger any lien on the

12

land?
13

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

They stand in first

14

place.

The

disproportionate effect comes from two facts:

15

the first is, the stipulated fact that the value, the assess­
16

ed value of agricultural lands within the Salt River Project
17

in the District and the Association are generally twice the
18

value of comparable, otherwise comparable lands outside the
19

District.

And there is no question why.

That's also been

20

stipulated.

It's because of the water conservation activity

21

that has been carried out by this District.

But second,

22

and from a broader perspective, this District is owned by the
23

landholders.

They brought it into existence, they nursed it

24

through some very hard times, where not only the security
25

of their lands but also acreage assessments were necessary

to this Court's consistent ruling that in cases of this kind

4

the presumption is always in favor of equal access to the

in

If you begin with an entity

That's right, Your Honor -Isn't the issue here whether this

is an entity of government ?
MR. MEYERSON:

Well this of course is an entity of

14

government, because it is a political subdivision of the state

15

of Arizona, Your Honor.

16

is it so like a business that --

17

QUESTION:

I think the question really becomes

Was the Salyer case decided on the grounc

18

that the entity there was so like a business that the rule of

19

Reynolds v. Sims was inapplicable?

20

MR. MEYERSON:

Was that it's rationale?

No, Justice Stewart, I think the

21

rationale of Salyer was the Court accepted the fact that

22

there was state action because there was a political sub­

23

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MEYERSON:

Right.
A rational

basis test should be

8

used to evaluate the acreage voting system, rather than

9

the compelling interest standard.

So I think Salyer stands

10

for the principle that the argument that the District here is

11

much like the business and therefore no principle of consti­

12

tutional laws should be applied is incorrect.

13

suggest that it is the compelling interest analysis because

QUESTION:

But if some type of voting structure

Would it be constitutional for the

19

government.to appoint a committee of landowners to select

the board of directors?

21

MR. MEYERSON:

I think this Court has held that

22

when the state adopts an appointive system of government

23

within the general terms, the states are free to do what they

24

will --

25

QUESTION:

And the governor could delegate that
27

1

power to precisely the same people who are now the electors,

2

I suppose?

3
4

MR. MEYERSON:

That would be a realm of discretion

left to the legislature.

5

QUESTION: You'd have a Pyrrhic victory if he did thkt.

6

MR. MEYERSON:

Well, I hope that would not happen.

7

I'd like to emphasize that when the state delegates the

8

electoral process, that raises different constitutional

9

considerations and that's what the state of Arizona has done

10

here.

11

QUESTION:

But is it just a matter of labels?

12

You call it the electoral process; one might also call it

13

the process of selecting the board of directors of this

14

entity.

15

MR. MEYERSON:

16

QUESTION:

Well -- I think that this Court --

And it would seem to me that you've

17

conceded that the state constitutionally could have precisely

18

the same people do the selecting.

19

MR. MEYERSON:

Well the state constitutionally can

20

appoint a dentist to the dental board, it can appoint a

21

cosmetologist to the cosmetology board; when we are engaged

22
23
24
25

in the appointive process there is more lee-way given to the
state than we are -- then we have in the electoral process.
I think the opinions of this Court are quite clear, that
when the state decides that a matter is so important to

submit a vote to the people that that raises the constitu­

2

tional concerns --

QUESTION:

5

6

that's any different than saying the governor can do the

7

same thing, and constitutionally.

8

MR. MEYERSON:

And here, Arizona has decided this

is

They have decided for a
I don't know why

Well I think it is quite different.

9

Mr. Lee says that the state of Arizona should be free to

10

make decisions with respect to nuclear power generation,

11

water allocation, utility rates.

12

should be free to do that because the state legislature is

13

elected by the people on one person-one vote.

14

state delegates those important decisions to a local group,

15

it then must provide that the election of that local group

16

must be in accordance with constitutional principles.

17

I think there is a difference when the state delegates

18

decision-making authority to a local governmental agency and

19

provides for an election of the directors of that local

20

governmental agency.

21

and private businesses.

6

QUESTION:

Well isn't it your theory that -- and

the theory of the Court of Appeals that the furnishing, the

development of water and its control is so important that it

9

should be considered a governmental function?

Justice White, I don't think that

was the holding of the Court of Appeals?

12

QUESTION:

MR. MEYERSON:

I think that in Arizona is an essen­

14

tial and important function, but I don't think that's the

15

legally determinative --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. MEYERSON:

What is it, then?
The legally determinative factors

18

in this case, Your Honor, I think are that this is a polit­

19

ical subdivision created by the state of Arizona, and that

20

it's given powers and authority that substantially affect

21

people in important ways, by providing essential electric

22

and water services.

election?
HR. MEYERSON:

That is critical to our case; that

the state has adopted an election process.

It has restricted

that election process to property owners.
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

A few minutes ago you

seemed to have a distinction between water being provided
for people in the cities to drink and other purposes, and
water provided for irrigation.

Do you consider those on a

different level, one higher than the other?
MR. MEYERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I think

this Court has given some higher consideration to municipal
type functions such as electric and water activities in the
Cipriano case, because there, in a municipal bond election
this Court held that you could not restrict voting to property
owners because the activity of the municipal utility affected
all citizens.

Whereas in the Salyer case, because there the

water delivery activities had its effect solely upon the
landowners and the water was used for agricultural purposes
only, this Court permitted the acreage voting system.

So I

think this Court has given a higher use or more important
use, if you will, to water uses that affect residents in
their capacity as citizens as opposed to farmers.
QUESTION:

So you wouldn't be taking this position

24

if the District didn't sell water to the city?
25

MR. MEYERSON:

If all the District water was used
32

1

solely for' agricultural purposes, that would have an effect

2

on the merits of our case.

3
4

QUESTION:

Well does it affect -- how much of an

effect?

5

MR. MEYERSON:

I don't think it would have the

6

effect that it would result -- that it would change the

7

outcome, Your Honor, because here the District finances all

8

of its activities primarily through electric sales, and

9

the electric activities have a significant impact on the

10

entire lifestyle and economic livelihood of the Phoenix

11

metropolitan area.

12

Now I'd like to address one other --

14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Are you suggesting that the furnishing

of electric power is inherently or primarily a governmental
function?
MR. MEYERSON:
Justice Burger, at all.

No, I'm not suggesting that, Chief
What I am suggesting, when it is

taken on by a governmental entity such as, in this Court's
opinion in the Cipriano decision, then this Court has said
because the provision of electric service is an essential
function that affects all citizens, it is impermissible to
exclude non-property-owners from voting.

So I think the

important distinction is whether the activity is carried out
by government or not, and here it is carried out by a polit­
ical subdivision of the state of Arizona.

doesn't it?

8

MR. MEYERSON:

QUESTION:

10

That's right, Justice Brennan.

And some of that money, I gather, are

the proceeds of electric generation, is it not?

1 1

MR. MEYERSON:

12

QUESTION:

That's right.

Now suppose vou had an expanded voting

13

scheme, which, as you suggest, would take in all of the non­

14

landowners in the District, could they then take that money

15

now used on irrigation projects and lower electric utility

rates ?

MR. MEYERSON:

Justice Brennan, I think that today's

horizon, but --

MR. MEYERSON:

That's right, they --

They do, in fact.
And they do in fact.

And if they -- if there were a new

8

board elected by a district-wide constituency, I take it

9

they would say well we won't give that much to water irri­

10

gation, rather we'll reduce electrical rates.

1 1

MR. MEYERSON:

They might do that, Justice Brennan,

12

but I'd like to emphasize that this Court has said, time

13

after time, in the Carrington v. Rash case, and in the Evans

14

V. Cornman case, that the mere fact that one group may vote

the way the people who are --

Well, I'm sure vou recognize what I'm

getting: at is the second element, the disproportionate

impact element of Salyer, whether or not that

20

MR. MEYERSON:

is

Well Justice Brennan. I think they've

21

turned Salyer on its head because the disproportionate

22

impact there was and it has always been in the dissenting

23

opinions of this Court, who is paying the cost of government?

24

This Court has looked at whether or not the landowners

25

were financing the District in Salyer, and concluded that

because all of the costs assessed against the -- or, the

District's costs were assessed against the land.

always been to look at who is paying the bill.

5

6

to vote.

upside down, and said we're getting the benefit, because it's

8

the customers and everyone else that's paying the bill

through the electric rates and through the lien on the land,

And

in

And at a

What the Appellants have now done is turn that

10

they are now saying that just -- that acreage voting is

1 1

justified because they get a small economic benefit.

12

think we would respectfully suggest to you that out of a

13

three billion dollar utility

14

has 500 million dollars in revenues a year, that a ten

15

million dollar subsidy is no reason to continue to restrict

16

voting in this vital organization to landowners and by the

17

way, that means very large landowners.

And I

Now, Mr. Lee was in error when he told you that

19

200,000 people vote in these elections, or that 200,000 people

20

can vote in the elections.

21

there are only about 160,000 that are eligible to be voted

22

because the corporate-owned lands can't be voted.

23

an important distinction in the Salyer decision, where Justice

Rehnquist recognized that there everybody could vote, whether

they were individual owners or corporate owners or not.

14

MR. MEYERSON:

MR. MEYERSON:

I can tell you very quickly.

Well, if it's in the stipulation -In 1970 , 621 voters voted. .19,00 0

excuse me, and in 1974, 561 voters voted 15,000 acres.

20

MR. MEYERSON:

They are not regular polling places,

MR. MEYERSON:

6

How many people are landowners?
In our stipulation, there were 359,0 00

property-owners in the District.

QUESTION:

8

MR. MEYERSON:

9

In our stipulation --

Now --

Who all -- who would be eligible to vote
Who would be eligible to vote, but

of course, most of them would be homeowners who would be

10

voting fractional votes, out of that -- we are never able to

11

identify the number of one-acre votes and above -- but those

12

359,000.1 would suspect, are primarily homeowners who are

13

the people who own one-quarter and one-eighth, one-sixteenth

14

of a vote.
QUESTION:

15
16

Well doesn't the District notify the

members of when and where the election is going to be held?
MR. MEYERSON:

17

Justice Rehnquist, in recent years

18

they have placed ads in the paper and I believe bill stuffers

19

go out in the electric bills, but frankly as you can see

20

from the history of the voting pattern, when you ask people

21

to vote an eighth of a vote or a sixteenth of a vote, that

22

is so

23

don't go

24

we pointed out in our memorandum, in the case of one of the

25

board members who owns

antithetical to democratic processes, that people just
out and do that.

And of course, it would take as

800 acres of land, at least he did
41

1

at the time we filed the action, it would take about 3500

2

homeowners to equal his vote, 3500 homeowners would have to

3

go to the polls to have the same voting -QUESTION:

4

Do you know how many landowners there

5

are who -- who could make up -- who would own a majority of

6

the acres?
MR. MEYERSON:

7

I'm sorry, Justice White, I really

8

don’t know that.

I understand that in a number of the sub­

9

divisions of the District and there are ten of these divis­

10

ions, that theoretically in a number of those, if

11

homeowners went out and voted, they could have the same

12

number of votes as the large landowners.
QUESTION:

13

all the

It's rather strange if a very few people

14

could vote a majority of the land, it's very strange that a

15

majority of the eligible land has never been voted, appar­

16

ently?

17

would vote.

18

People with that much of an interest, you would think

MR. MEYERSON:

Justice White, I'm afraid that what

19

has happened over the years is that because people with very

20

large land holding -- holdings have been able to control this

21

entity by casting relatively few individual votes; that has

22

so discouraged --

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but if a few landowners -- if a

24

few very large landowners, not very many, could cast more

25

than 19,000 acres, could vote more -42

1

MR. MEYERSON:

Well now, over 50 percent of the

2

land is urbanized.

3

owners there are.

4

century that number will be declining, of course.

5

QUESTION:

I frankly don't know how many large landI suspect as we go on into the 21st

Well then, let's suppose that every land-

6

owner in the District owned only one -- less than an acre.

7

Then

8

one vote almost, isn't it?

9
10

what's

wrong

with

MR. MEYERSON:

the voting system; it's one man-

I guess theoretically that might

work.

1 1

QUESTION: Theoretically, yes.

12

MR. MEYERSON:

13
14

But, that

hasn't happened and that

isn't the case.
QUESTION:

Well I don't know, if you can't tell us

15

how many people are around in this District who own large

16

acres of land, one of your fundamental complaints is that

17

just a few people can run this District?

18

MR. MEYERSON:

It's one of our fundamental practical

19

complaints; it's not one of our fundamental legal complaints.

20

As a practical matter, yes, a few large landowners can con­

21

trol the District and we would refer the Court to the exhibits

22

which are attached that indicate the resumes and the affili­

23

ations of the District board members, I think that proves our

24

point that that has happened.

25

QUESTION:

But don't you say the tendency is in the
43

1

opposite direction, -- more and more subdivisions so that

2

there will be more and more one acre votes and less and less

3

large landowner votes .
MR. MEYERSON:

4

I think eventually that will happen,

5

but we'll still be excluding all of the non-property owners.

6

We seem to have forgotten about them in our analysis that

7

they are also paying the bills, paying the freight, so to

8

speak, and are also benefitting from the availability of the

9

electric system and the water delivery system, I think this

10

discussion has focussed too much on the rights and roles of

1 1

the fractional acre owners.

12

case on an argument that weighting the voting system is

13

wrong, we think that's offensive to the Constitution.

14

case is based upon the fact that property ownership is a

15

condition at all.

16

ions, or more homes, are built, in no way in my opinion,

17

undercuts the fundamental constitutional principle that

18

we're articulating here, and that is that non-property owners

19

should not be excluded.

Meyerson?

exactly, but we do know that this -- that Maricopa County

2

has over 1 and 1/2 million people, it's the largest metro­

were substantial numbers of people and I just avow to you

MR. MEYERSON:

that this case is really an

whether this Court concludes that a, subsidized group is

There is an annual assess­

Stipulation refers.
But even more important, from the beginning it was
these people, because of taking, they were the ones who sub­

White and Mr. Meyerson concerning the fact that the funda­

I'd like to clarify just exactly to what extent the large
landowners do have control of this District at the present
time.

Mr. Meyerson has
