ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

We'll hear arguments

MR. HOROWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the

11

United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.

12

sue involves the construction of Section 38 U.S.C. 2021(b)(3),

13

a section of what are commonly known as the veterans's reem­

14

ployment rights provisions.

15

provides that reservists "shall not be denied retention in

16

employment, or any promotion or other incident or advantage

17

of employment because of any obligation as a member of a

18

reserve component of the armed forces."

19

The is­

This section, enacted in 1968,

The facts of this case are as follows.

Petitioner

20

is employed at respondent's refinery in Lima, Ohio.

21

refinery operates around the clock, seven days a week, three

22

eight-hour shifts per day.

23

per week for a total of 40 hours, according to a rotating

24

shift schedule that is established by the respondent.

25

This

Each employee works five days

During 1975 and 1976 petitioner was a member of
3

1

a reserve component of the armed forces, which entailed cer­

2

tain training obligations.

3

to train with his unit on one weekend per month.

4

lishing the shift schedule, respondent took no cognizance of

5

petitioner's training obligations and therefore petitioner was

6

frequently scheduled to work on weekend days that conflicted

7

with his training obligations.

8

arrange

9

petitioner was unable to work 40 hours during those weeks,

10

and respondent made other arrangements for other employees

1 1

to substitute for him.

12
13

a

As a general rule he was required
In estab­

Thus, unless he was able to

voluntary exchange of shifts with a fellow employee,

As a result, petitioner lost 192 hours of work and
salary over a 15-month period.

14

Now, the parties entered into a stipulation in the

15

district court and stipulated that respondent took no steps

16

to provide petitioner with any work hours during these weeks

17

to substitute for those lost as a result of his military

18

obligations.

19

Petitioner brought this suit in the United States

20

District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleging

21

that Respondent's failure to attempt to accommodate his re­

22

serve obligations violated his statutory rights guaranteed

23

by Section 2021(b)(3).

24

the district court granted petitioner's motion for summary

25

judgment.

Based upon a stipulated set of facts

The court held that respondent had denied the
4

1

petitioner the right to a 40-hour week, an incident or advan­

2

tage of employment under the Act

3

of his reserve obligations in its scheduling.

4

by

refusing to take account

On appeal the Court of Appeals reversed.

The Court

5

of Appeals agreed that the right to be scheduled for a 40-hour

6

work week at respondent's refinery was an incident or advan­

7

tage of employment within the meaning of the statute.

8

ever, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the district court

9

and with other courts of appeals as to the scope of the pro­

10
1 1

How­

tection that the statute provides such a benefit.
The Court of Appeals held that Section 2021(b)(3)

12

protects reservists only against intentional unequal treatment

13

or on-the-job bias by their employers.

14

vist is denied an employment benefit because of the operation

15

of "a facially neutral rule" that is applied uniformly to

16

all employees, in that case, the court held that the statute

17

is not violated.

18

However, if a reser­

Applying these principles to this case, the court

19

held that respondent had not violated the Act.

20

work schedule was established without regard to his training

21

obligations and his training-related absences were treated

22

just as other nonmilitary absences of another employee would

23

have been treated.

24

neutral treatment, not bias, was shown.

25

Petitioner's

Thus, in the view of the Court of Appeals,

It is our contention that the principles on which
5

1

the court based its decision stem from an erroneous interpre­

2

tation of the statute.

3

would be permitted blindly to follow rules that, although

4

neutral on their face, have an inevitable adverse effect on

5

reservists not in situations where that adverse impact can be

6

completely eliminated if the employer seeks to accommodate

7

rather than simply ignore the fact of petitioner's reserve

8

obligations.

9

QUESTION:

Congress did not intend that employers

Do you have suggestions, Mr. Horowitz,

10

how do you think the employer should accommodate to'satisfy hi s

11

obligation under the statute?

12
13

MR. HOROWITZ:

You mean, on these specific facts?

It depends, on a case by case basis.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. HOROWITZ:

All right, let's start with these.
Okay, well, first of all, we don't

16

think the actual means of

17

this Case because . the reaord reveals that the employer made nc

18

effort to make any arrangements.

19

simply by exchanging shifts.

20

employees had to take respondent's shift, employees that

21

work on a so-called extra board, and there's nothing in the

22

record that indicates why petitioner couldn't then have taken

23

shifts caused by the extra board employees.

14

15

QUESTION:

He would still work the same number of

But under your theory, every time that a

16

worker is dissatisfied with the employer's effort to accommo­

17

date, it would be a question that would have to be resolved

18

in court, whether there had been good faith effort to

19

accommodate him.

20

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, it's not a question of whether

21

he's dissatisfied with the accommodation.

22

of whether the benefit is denied to him.

23

didn't give him a 40-hour work week, for example.

dispute over what the meaning of the statute is.

couldn't accommodate.

all.

which we've asserted as directly in conflict with this one,

10

the employer conceded that it was no trouble to arrange the

1 1

schedule that way.

There's been a lot

There's

In most situations it's no trouble at

For example, in the 5th Circuit case, in the West case,

12

Now, the facts of this case may raise a slightly

13

more difficult question because you have a small plant and

14

it's making --

15
16

QUESTION:

And you've also got seven days a week,

24 hours a day, scheduling.

17

MR. HOROWITZ:

Yes, but the reservist is going to

18

be there for five days, so it's not clear that there's any

19

difficulty in scheduling him for those five days.

20

QUESTION:

Well, did the employer treat this re­

21

servist like he treated other employees who wanted to be

22

away?

23

MR. HOROWITZ:

That's right.

He treated

his re­

24

serve absences just as if they were personal leaves of absence

25

for whatever reason —

1

QUESTION:

So your submission is that he's not en­

2

titled to do that, that he -MR. HOROWITZ:

3

that the statute puts a --

That's right..

Congress has enacted

4

a special statute that provides for special treatment of

reservists -QUESTION:

6

It requires him to treat the reservists

7

more favorably than others, including more favorably with

8

respect to absences?
MR. HOROWITZ:

9
10

I don't think it's a question of

treating the reservist more favorably.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. HOROWITZ:

The end result --

That's what I just asked you.
What we contend is that the employer

13

has to give special treatment to the absences.

14

not satisfied simply by -QUESTION:

15
16

All right.

The statute's

He is to give more favorable

treatment to these absences than to other?
MR. HOROWITZ:

17

It's not permitted to treat an ab­

18

sence for reserve duty as if it was any other sort of absence.

19

Now, the bottom line is not more favorable treatment for the

20

reservist.

21

other employees have.

22

that these are absences that the reservists have no control

23

over.

MR. HOROWITZ:

I think it's in the same ball park.

Congress has specifically put it in a special category.

11

This is a recognition that military service is. impor­

it, not be discouraged.
QUESTION:

Are the problems of accommodation,

12

Mr. Horowitz, any different under this statute than under

13

those statutes that the Congress has enacted requiring accom­

14

modation of religious preferences?

15

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I think it's quite different

16

than under Title VII, because the situation under Title VII,

17

it's a complete anti-discrimination statute that intends to

18

prohibit discrimination against all groups of employees, reli

19

gious being one.

20

directed at military absences.

21

some more accommodation required here than there is in the

22

Title VII problem.

But here there is a specific statute

QUESTION:

So I think that there may be

More required here?

Even though that's

just statutorily based.

MR. HOROWITZ:

5

Is that why you don't see TWA v. Hardisor

Well, we think that TWA v. Hardison

really has very little to do with this case.

QUESTION:

MR. HOROWITZ:

First of all --

Is that the reason?
Well, for several reasons.

9

are quite different.

One, the

The purposes of the statute

I mean, here you have a specific statute

10

aimed at a particular group of employees.

11

complete anti-discrimination.

12

in Hardison the employee himself was asking for preferential

13

treatment.

14

so he was asking for a schedule that was better than what

15

the other employees were entitled to, even though those

16

employees had greater seniority.

17

just asking for an opportunity to work.

18

going to end up being the same, in the final analysis.

19

20

There you have

Now, you have to recognize,

QUESTION:

Now, here, the respondent's
And the schedule is

The statute doesn't say anything about

rescheduling, does it?

21

MR. HOROWITZ:

22

QUESTION:

No.

It does give him, certainly, something

23

other employees don't have.

24

and still maintain his seniority and other things, so cer­

25

tainly there is a statute here directed to reservists, but --

He can be away for reserve duty

11

1

It specifically says what the employer may not deprive him

2

of, but it doesn't say anything about his having to change

3

his shifts or anything.

4

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, there are two different sec­

5

tions that apply to reservists.

6

first enacted in 1960.

7

right to a leave of absence when he has reserve duty and when

8

he returns from that leave of absence he's entitled to be

restored to his employment with the same seniority, vacation,

MR. HOROWITZ:

No question about that being violated?
No question about that being violatec

14

years later, to increase the protection for reservists, and in

15

that section the statutory language is that "the reservist

16

may not be denied retention of employment" et cetera "or

17

other incident or advantages of employment because of his re­

18

serve obligations."

19

20
21

22

But Congress had enacted an additional section, several

Now, in its literal terms, that statute has been
violated here.

Both courts found that the right to a 40-hour

work week at the refinery was an incident or advantage of em­
ployment within the meaning of the statute.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. HOROWITZ:

25

QUESTION:

The right to work 40 hours?
Yes.

Right to work.

Where is the right, where's that in, the

12

1

source of any right to work 40 hours a week?
MR. HOROWITZ:

2
3

The right to work 40 hours a week is

based on the employer’s practice at this particular refinery.

4

QUESTION:

Well, that's what he was employed for.

5

QUESTION:

The employer would have been glad to have

6

him, if he had worked the 40 hours he wanted him to work.
MR. HOROWITZ:

This is a right that is granted to

8

employees.

Employees want to be able to depend upon a cer­

Or is it simply that, were it not for his reservist

MR. HOROWITZ:

He's denied meaningful right to work

40 hours a week because of his reserve status.

Now, it's true

that they scheduled him, on schedule,

20

I mean, if the fact that other employees would have to work

more weekends, or if it might interfere with some seniority

system, there is certainly strong evidence that it's an

unreasonable accommodation.

I don't

No, we absolutely concede that he's

Every time

And the employer says, you must be out of your mind.

Now, you say that the employer certainly could say

22
23

that in the latter case, but he couldn't say that to the

24

reservist?

25

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I think you've put your finger
15

1

on it.

2

QUESTION:

He certainly is being favored, isn't he?

3

QUESTION:

Well, has Congress made any provision for

4

going fishing?
MR. HOROWITZ:

5

Well, he's not being favored, because

6

he doesn't have the right to go fishing either.

7

is just a special treatment of this particular category of

8

absences that Congress has mandated.

9

QUESTION:

I mean, this

Well, all right, so you do say that it

10

is a special treatment, that the Act does give him special

1 1

treatment.

12
13

MR. HOROWITZ:

It requires the employer to treat

his absences differently.

The statute is not satisfied by treating

the reservist like everyone else?

MR. HOROWITZ:

There's no argument

about

only question is whether the Congress intended to give him

they're a little concerned that the unions will complain.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. HOROWITZ:

16

That Standard Oil is unionized?

Yes.
I think we can assume that; yes.

There is a collective bargaining agreement involved.
Now, this case is basically one of statutory con­

17
18

struction.

Apart from the plain language of the statute that

19

I've already alluded to, there are several principles of

20

statutory construction this Court has established under the

21

veterans provisions, and each of these points towards peti­

22

tioner's construction of the statute.

23

First, it's always been recognized that the provi­

24

sions ought to be given liberal construction in favor of the

25

veteran or, as in this case, the reservist.
18

Now, despite this

1

command, the Court of Appeals adopted a very narrow view of

2

the protection

3

biguous legislative mandate to the contrary.

4

of what the Court of Appeals recognized to be a plausible

5

interpretation is completely contrary to what this Court has

6

established as the rule for construing the statute.

7

here because there was no clear and unam­
This rejection

Secondly, this Court has repeatedly recognized the

8

underlying purpose of these provisions, and that is that

9

servicemen not be disadvantaged by serving their country, to

10

the extent possible.

In Alabama Power this Court stated

1 1

this principle thusly:

12

desire to minimize the destruction in individuals' lives re­

13

sulting from military needs."

QUESTION:

a two-week summer duty and when he came back from it he gets

16

paid so much for being in the reserves, he couldn't claim the

17

complete wages that he would have received, but he made a

18

claim against the employer for the difference between what he

19

got paid by the Government for his reserve duty and what he

20

would have made had he stayed at the plant and worked?

21

MR. HOROWITZ:

We said in our brief, there is no

22

basis for such a claim, unless there is some other employment

23

benefit I'm not aware of.

24

about in this case, the right to a 40-hour work week, he was

25

not denied that right, if he's gone for two weeks.

But on this benefit we're talking

19

If he's

1

gone for a whole week, there's no way the employer can sched­

2

ule him for 40 hours of work that week, so he's not entitled

3

to anything.

4

We're not -- he's just asking for the right to

QUESTION:

6

And if it's seasonal employment and his

7

reserve duty occurs during the season, he has no claim?

8

A cannery-type thing?
MR. HOROWITZ:

9

I'm not sure exactly what situation

10

you're talking about.

Tf there's' a way that they can work it

out, that he can work the hours, then he has a claim.

Perhaps I could focus the issue a little

Let's suppose the reservist worked at a store where
20

1

each employee was entitled to two weekends of work in a given

2

month at double pay, and the employer has historically divided

3

the weekends on an alphabetical basis.

4

the first half of the alphabet work on the first and third

5

weekends of each month, those in the second half of the alpha­

6

bet worked on the second and fourth weekends of each month.

7

Now, Mr. Andrews, who works at the store, joins the reserves

8

and now has an obligation to attend reserve duty on the third

9

weekend of those months.

Those employees in

Now, our position is that the

10

employer has a duty, since it is no trouble for him at all,

11

to schedule Andrews on the second and the fourth weekend of

12

those months and schedule someone else on the first and the

13

third weekends, even though that violates his long-establishec

14

rule of how he allocates the weekends.

15

The Court of Appeals position is that the employer

16

is entitled to rely on his rule.

17

tral, does not discriminate against reservists, and therefore

18

they don't have to do anything for him.

19

QUESTION:

The rule is facially neu­

What if the rule were that there's a one-

20

month vacation for all employees, and the vacation for A-to-M

21

employees is July and the vacation for N-to-Z employees is

22

August, and some have scheduled, say, refresher teaching

23

courses, some have scheduled vacations with their families,

24

some have scheduled any number of things.

the reservist has a right to insist that he : get the vacation

Yes.

MR. HOROWITZ: I'm not sure what employment benefit he's

being denied if his reserve duty comes out on his vacation.

Congress had in mind.

MR. HOROWITZ:

That doesn't even really raise the

20

guarantees him a leave of absence and gaurantees that he can

come back with his vacation intact.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL'S. McAULIFFE, ESQ.,

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21

22

Very well.

MR. McAULIFFE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

23

During the course of an average year each hourly

24

employee at Sohio's petroleum refinery in Lima, Ohio, will

25

have seven weekends scheduled off from work, during that year.
24

1

For the other 45 weekends of the calendar year, that employee

2

will be scheduled to work:

3

both Saturday and Sunday; on the other 15 working one or the

4

other.

5

on 30 of those weekends working

There is a reason why life appears to be so draco­

6

nian at the refinery, and that is because, like most petro­

7

leum refineries and like many other workplaces in this

8

country, the refinery operates seven days a week, 24 hours a

9

day, 365 days a year.

That means that on every weekend a

10

full operating work force is required to run that refinery.

11

If weekends were staffed on a voluntary basis, in most cases

12

there would be serious practical problems getting a full staff

15

exists with the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers, a system

16

of routine rotating scheduling of weekend work on an involun­

17

tary basis. Under this system, which is set forth in the

18

record, every employee will have on the average seven week­

19

ends off per year, that I have mentioned.

20

For that reason Sohio has developed at this

In this case we're dealing with one of these

Mr. McAuliffe, could I interrupt with a

24

question, because it affects the argument right here?

that.

That's correct, Mr. Justice White.

an employee has a conflict, he can change voluntarily.
QUESTION:

He can change -- I still don't think

6

you've answered' my question.

My question is whether he could

be scheduled with the number of days off he needs, the number

of Saturdays and Sundays off to accommodate his reserve

obligation, without requiring any other other employee in the

10

plant to work any more Saturdays or Sundays than they now

days as well as the days of the other employees.

MR. McAULIFFE:

there is a conflict to relieve this employee of his obligatior

to work his regular schedule and to grant that employee a

Under this agreement it has to be voluntary.

case.

6

QUESTION:

But in any event, Mr. McAuliffe, as I

7

understand your submission, it is that all that Congress re­

8

quired you to do was (a) let him have a leave of absence, and

9

(b) on his return give him what the statute expressly iden­

10

tifies, namely, restore seniority, status, pay, and vacation.

1 1

And that's all you have to do because Congress didn't say you

12

had to do any more?

13

MR. McAULIFFE:

Well, that's correct, Mr. Justice

14

Brennan, because the right to seniority that is protected is

15

a very broad right.

There's no contention here.

QUESTION:

24
25

Yes, that's correct, and --

Incidentally, that's the same wording

that's appeared in some of these veterans return statutes.
MR. McAULIFFE:

The wording is precisely the same
33

1

with one difference, and that is that provisions relating to

2

reservists also use the word "vacation," because there's a

3

specific protection for the reservist that he cannot be

4

charged any vacation time --

5

QUESTION:

Well, my question was going to be, haven't

6

we had some of our cases under the veterans return statutes

7

that have interpreted this wording a little more broadly

8

than you submit?

when you're talking about seniority to protect the veteran,

13

or in this case the reservist, protect that absence, give

14

them protections that may not exist elsewhere.

15

between our position and the Government's position in this

16

case is that we freely concede that the leave of absence is

17

to be treated better, and, in fact, it is, because of the

18

leave of absence, because of the seniority protection.

Why did Congress pass the most recent

amendment to the Veterans Reemployment Act?

18

MR. McAULIFFE:

Congress passed this because when

19

they first enacted the reinstatement protection for reservists

20

in 1960 they left a gap in protection, when you compare that

21

to the protection they had already provided for the regular

22

military.

23

create two kinds of statutory protection.

24

reinstatement right with protection of seniority and status.

25

Congress enacted that for reservists in 24(d) in 1960.

The statutes that apply to the regular military

The first is a

discharge without cause for a fixed period after their return

to work.

5

a veteran would be reinstated, given full seniority protec­

6

tion, and then once that had been done, a few weeks down the

7

road that person would be released from employment.

8
9

The reasons for that being to prevent the case where

In 1960, when Congress specifically extended the
statute to the reservists, they provided no comparable protec­

10

tion, and if you look at the legislative history that led to

11

the passage of

12

ment of Labor in proposing the legislation, or the Department

13

of Defense in supporting it, was that there were instances of

14

employees being reinstated after having exercised their reser­

15

vist rights and then being discharged from employment or

16

denied promotions or suffering other adverse treatment.

QUESTION:

Dumped, in effect, after a pro forma

compliance with the statute?
MR. McAULIFFE:

That's correct.

Absent 21(b)(3),

20

there would be no protection under the statute in that case,

21

and that's the reason Congress enacted it.

22

it's clear from the legislative history that that was their

purpose and this

the Department of Labor from that time to this date, which

That's correct, Mr. Justice White.

At least the union will probably say so.

MR. McAULIFFE:

I should think so.

QUESTION:

Well, couldn't the company have at least

13

It certainly would be.
I wouldn't advise

trying it.

14

undertaken on its own to have solicited other employees to

15

see if they wanted to take this man's place while he was at

16

camp, rather than leaving it totally up to him?

17

MR. McAULIFFE:

It could have been done.

11 am sure

18

it would not be impossible to do that, but we're facing facts

19

where we know that solicitation was already done by the

20

employee affected and there was no one willing to exchange on

21

a voluntary basis.

22

23

right to force somebody to make the shift.

If it had been 100, for example, wouldn'1

it be reasonable to assume that someone would put that in

11

MR. McAULIFFE:

12

QUESTION:

13

Yes, it certainly would be.

To try to accommodate 100 reservists

would be perhaps a bit of a problem, wouldn't it?
MR. McAULIFFE:

14

Well, you run into the answer I gave

15

to Mr. Justice Stevehs before, what will wofk'in the'case of

16

one employee won't work as you' get, get more and more, perhaps,

17

more and more, employees involved. We don't have any specific

knowledge in the record of this case, how many employees are

19

affected.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

20
21

I think in terms of reading -Excuse me.

I think

Mr. Justice Stevens had a question for you.

22

MR. McAULIFFE:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I was just going to ask you this one

24

question.

Maybe you were going to>>address it.

25

brief you say, "This case presents a radically different
39

In your

1

issue from that presented in the Safeway case in the 5th

2

Circuit."

3

decided?

Do you think the 5th Circuit case was correctly

4

MR. McAULIFFE:

5

QUESTION:

6

No, I do not, Mr. Justice Stevens.

Seems to me your position really is

inconsistent with the 5th Circuit's holding.
MR. McAULIFFE:

7

I think the 5th Circuit holding

8

was incorrect and also that the logic that it followed in

9

getting to that holding was incorrect.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. McAULIFFE:

That's what I'll --

It's different.
I think this case reflects In a

12

way that the West case in the 5th Circuit does not, some of

13

the difficulties with trying to develop an accommodation

14

scheme, because you do have a fixed schedule, you do have a

15

collective bargaining agreement that limits flexibility in

16

changing that schedule, which was not, at least not in the

17

record, as far as we know in the -QUESTION:

18

Another way to put the question, I sup­

19

pose, would you think this case would be different if instead,

20

if the agreement, instead of giving the employees a right to

21

be scheduled for 40 hours, had said they have a right to work

22

40 hours?

23

that wouldn't make any difference.

24

MR. McAULIFFE:

25

It seems to me your argument would still be that

It would not.

It would -- the

answer to that question would depend somewhat upon how the
40

1

collective bargaining agreement was construed and whether

2

that was actually construed as a guarantee of 40 hours per

3

week, a guarantee that the employer would assure on a regular

4

basis for the right -QUESTION:

5

Seems to me you'd still argue they've

6

got to show up for work to get -- if you offer them the job

7

for 40 hours, that satisfies your requirement under the

8

agreement and it also would meet the statute.
MR. McAULIFFE:

9

That's precisely our argument,

10

Mr. Justice Stevens.

11

in our reading of the statute and the reading that the

12

petitioner urges, does come down to the question of whether

13

or not there is a reasonable accommodation requirement that

14

applies.

15

if you look at the statute, there's nothing in the language

16

of Section 21(b)(3) which even hints at there being a reason­

17

able accommodation requirement.

18

in another section of the same statute Congress spoke very

19

specifically to what types of accommodation should be pro­

20

vided when you have a conflict between a reservist schedule

21

and a regular work schedule.

22

The principal difference in reading,

It's our position that there is not, and that, first,

You also have the fact that

I'm referring to Section 24(d).

You also have a very clear legislative history of

23

Section 21(b)(3) which shows that its purpose was to protect

24

against discriminatory treatment.

25

basis in the statute or the legislative history to support
41

We submit that there's no

1

the interpretation that the Government has urged upon you in

2

this case.

3

proper reading of 21(b)(3) is the only reading that is con­

4

sistent with the structure of the statute, with the legisla­

5

tive history, with the administrative guidance that employers

6

have gotten for ten years from the Department of Labor on

7

what their obligations are, as well as the best reading con­

8

sistent with the use of judicial resources to reconcile

9

claims of what may or may not, within a particular set of

10

We believe that the reading that we think ife the

facts, be reasonable accommodation.

11

In our view the Congress in 24(d) specifically ad­

12

dressed this question, and gave very detailed, specific, and

13

workable rules for employers to follow.

14

is that the facts in this case show that Sohio has met all of

15

its obligations with regard to the reserve absence, with re­

16

gard to the need to provide reinstatement rights, and with

17

regard to 2.1(b)(3) and its protection against discriminatory

18

treatment.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.,

23

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

24

QUESTION:

25

I have a couple of points.

Mr. Horowitz, the Government's position

is that only reasonable efforts to accommodate the needs of a
42

1

reservist are required under the statute.

2

is rather positive, isn't it?

3

that any person who holds a position described in the statute

4

shall not be denied other incident or advantage.

MR. HOROWITZ:

6

The statute itself

That's correct.

Do you in­

The plain language

7

of the statute is that reservists cannot be denied these bene­

fits. Now, we are willing to admit that Congress did not intenc

15
16

The statute doesn't impose a duty upon an

No, the statute imposed a duty on

the employer.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. HOROWITZ: An absolute duty; that's right.

19

QUESTION:

20

It seems to give absolute entitlements.

And therefore the requirement is an

absolute duty.

21

MR. HOROWITZ:

22

QUESTION:

23
24

25

There's an absolute duty.

If the statute means what you say it

means.
MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, in another portion of the

statute the Congress made clear in 2021(a) that it did not
43

require the employer to take unreasonable measures.

2

in connection with reinstating veterans.

3

Well, no, it doesn't --

Where is that found in 2021(a)?

MR. HOROWITZ:

This is at the end.

That's

Well, it's not

reprinted, because it's not germane to this case, but

7

in fact, there's a specific statement in the statute that

8

employers are not required to reinstate veterans where it

9

will be unreasonable or unduly burdensome to do so, and we -QUESTION:

10

But here, if the petitioner is entitled

11

to 40 hours a week, he's entitled to 40 hours a week, and

12

not entitled simply to his employer's making reasonable

13

efforts to see to it that he has 40 hours.
MR. HOROWITZ:

14

He's entitled to 40 hours a week, to

15

work 40 hours a week.

16

40 hours that week, it's recognized that Congress wouldn't

haven't intended it.
QUESTION:

Is there anybody else In that plant

entitled to 40 hours a week?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Everybody's entitled to 40 hours a

week.
QUESTION:

Well, It isn't impossible, it isn't im­

possible to give him his 40 hours.

24

MR. HOROWITZ:

25

QUESTION:

Not in this case, it's not impossible.

Well, I know, but it wouldn't be in any
44

case, would it?

2

MR. HOROWITZ:

QUESTION:

4

Sure, it's impossible --

All the employer would have to do is to

pay overtime.
MR. HOROWITZ:

5

No, if he's gone for the whole week,

6

it's impossible to schedule him to work 40 hours during that

7

week.

8
9

QUESTION:

I know, but if he's gone on weekends,

you can assign somebody else to work for him.

10

QUESTION:

Or pay him even though he's not there.

MR. HOROWITZ:

But that's not giving him -- the

12

employment benefit is the right to work, not the right to be

13

paid for not working.

to be given the employment benefit at issue, which is working

for 40 hours.

We're just saying that he's entitled

So,

he has the right to work 40 hours
