ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

MR. KNEEDLER:

79-870, United States Railroad Retirement

Mr. Kneedler, I think you may proceed whenever you're

We will hear arguments first

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is before the Court on direct appeal from

11

the United States District Court for the Southern District of
12

Indiana.

The District Court held that Section 3(h)(1) of the

13

Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 is unconstitutional under the
14

equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment due process
15

clause.
16

The Court rested this holding on its conclusion that •
17

Congress had no rational basis for excluding members of a certi­
18

fied class in this case for eligibility for the special benefit
19

provided under that section.
20
21

22

24
25

The Railroad Retirement Act provides a system of
retirement disability and survivor benefits for persons who pur­
sue careers in the railroad industry, just as the Social Security
Act provides these benefits for persons who pursue careers in
other industries.

Indeed, this Court observed in 1963 in Eichel
3

1

2
3

v. New York Central Railroad Company, quoting a lower court deci­
sion, that the Railroad Retirement Act is substantially a social
security act for employees of common carriers.

4

Railroad retirement and social security have been

5

separate systems since their inception in the 1930s but over the

6

years they have been integrated in many respects.

7

grated the two programs even further when it thoroughly revised

8

the Railroad Retirement Act in 1974.

in this case is a product of these further efforts at integra­

ceived to be a windfall accruing to certain persons who were eli­

12

gible to receive both social security and railroad retirement

13

benefits under prior law.

That section limits eligibility for what Congress per­

Because the relationship between social security and
railroad retirement provides important background for addressing
the issues presented in this case, I would first like to briefly
describe that relationship and the origins of Section 3(h)(1).
I will then explain Appellee's constitutional challenge to
Section 3(h)(1) in this case.
Railroad retirement benefits are paid out of a railroad

20

retirement account established in the Treasury and financed by
21

payroll taxes imposed on carriers and their employees.

In 1951

22

Congress instituted a financial interchange between this railroad
23

retirement account and the social security trust fund, which was
24

designed to place the trust fund in exactly the position it would
25

4

1

have been in if railroad work had been covered by the Social

2

Security Act.

3

ferred each year from the railroad retirement account to the

4

trust fund in amount equal to the taxes the carriers and their

5

employees would have paid if they'd been covered by social

6

security.

7

fund to the account in amount equal to the benefits that would

8

have been paid to retired railroad workers, their survivors, and

9

dependents, if railroad work had been covered by the Social

10

13
14
15

In return funds are transferred back from the trust

Security Act.
The effect of this arrangement was to provide a type

11
12

Under this financial interchange, funds are trans­

of reinsurance for the railroad retirement system.

However, it

became increasingly apparent in the years following 1951 that
this arrangement did not have the desired effect in the case of
employees who were entitled to receive both social security and
railroad retirement benefits, perhaps as a result of having split

16

their careers between work covered by the one act and work
17

covered by the other act.
18

QUESTION:

You said "perhaps."

It would always be the

19

result of that situation.
20

MR. KNEEDLER:

But -- yes; yes.

Well, one exception

21

might be where a person was working full time in the railroad
22

industry and had moonlighted, in effect, in a social security
23

job.

I suppose that's splitting --

24

QUESTION: He's splitting his career in a different way.
25

5

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

This -- the problem resulted be­

2

cause under the financial interchange program, whenever a retiree

3

railroad worker received social security benefits directly from

4

the trust fund, the reinsurance payment from the trust fund to

5

the railroad retirement account was reduced by the amount of the

6

social security benefits.

7

come to the account necessary to pay the railroad retirement

8

benefits.

9

for whom that reduction was made remained eligible to receive his

10

The result was a shortfall in the in­

But despite this shortfall, the individual beneficiary

full railroad retirement annuity.
This shortfall therefore resulted in a substantial and

11
12

accelerating drain on the assets in the railroad retirement

13

account and was a substantial cause of the serious financial

14

position of the account by the last 1960s.
QUESTION:

15
16
17

Aside --

What's the -- Mr. Kneedler, under the Social

Security Act standing alone, is there a vested interest in the
particular pattern of payments?
MR. KNEEDLER:

18

No, this Court held in Flemming v.

Nestor that social security benefits are noncontractual and that
19

Congress may alter or even eliminate them at any time.
20

QUESTION:

They can be given and they can be taken

21

away.
22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Exactly, and two terms ago, in this

23

Court's decision in Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, the Court applied
24

this same understanding to the Railroad Retirement Act.
25
6

1

Aside from the financial difficulties that these dual
2
3
4
5

6
7
8
9

benefits created, it was also perceived by the late 1960s that
the payment of dual benefits was inequitable because a person who
split his career between railroad and nonrailroad work received
more in combined benefits than a person would receive if he had
spent his entire career in an industry covered by just one act or
the other.
QUESTION:

But isn't this also true of people who might

spend 20 years with General Electric under social security and

10

then go into government service and have — be part of civil ser­

11

vice retirement?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, it is, and the reports on the 1974

13

legislation do call attention to the fact that this problem of

14

overlapping benefits does arise in several different situations

15

and there is no deduction in the manner of this case in those

16

other situations.

17

in the committee reports was that the railroad retirement system

18

is different because it was really designed as a social security

19

20
21

22
23

But the distinction that was perceived here,

system, a parallel program, and there was a financial interchange
between the two that does not occur, for instance, in the case of
military retirement or federal civil service retirement.
And in addition, in those cases, in

federal civil ser­

vice and military, the Government stands as employer to the per­
sons who were receiving the benefit.

Here, in this case, the

24

Government is using its taxing and spending power, or the power
25

7

1

to regulate interstate commerce, in collecting revenues and pay­
2
3
4

ing benefits in the private sector.

think, serve to distinguish why Congress took the first step in
integrating the two programs under the Railroad Retirement Act.

5
6
7

So these differences, I

Against this background Congress sought in the 1974 act
to integrate the two programs further and to phase out the wind­
fall that was perceived to result from the receipt of dual bene­

8

fits.

9

benefit that had been paid under prior law into two components

First, Congress divided up the basic railroad retirement

10

which were discussed in this Court, by this Court, in Hisquierdo

11

two terms ago.
The lower tier of those benefits is exactly comparable

12
13

to what the person would receive

14

The upper tier is smaller in amount and computed solely on the

15

basis of railroad work.

16

problem, however, Congress provided that the first tier of bene­

17

fits, the one that corresponds to social security, would be re­

18

duced whenever the retired railroad worker received social secu­

19

20
21

under the Social Security Act.

In order to eliminate the dual benefit

rity benefits directly from the trust fund.

This eliminated

the windfall, it eliminated the drain on the railroad retirement
account, and it also had the effect of passing through to the
individual beneficiary the reduction that had been made in the

22

reinsurance payment because of the receipt of social security
23

benefits .
24

Although these changes were designed to eliminate the
25

8

1

dual benefit problem in the future, Congress did include or
2
3
4

carry forward in the 1974 act certain transitional provisions to
preserve this windfall element for certain people who may have
been eligible to receive benefits under both acts prior to 1974.

5
6
7

This transitional or "grandfather" type of protection
is provided by Section 3(h) of the Act, the section that is at
issue in this case.

Section 3(h) provides yet a third tier of

8

benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act for certain of the

9

persons whose first tier was reduced because they were receiving

10

dual benefits.

11

was taken away under the first tier, and the effect is to isolate

12

in a separate section and as a separate benefit that portion of

Thus, in effect, the third tier adds back what

3

the combined social security and railroad retirement benefits

4

that Congress had perceived to be a windfall or an overlap under

5

prior law, and the act limits the eligibility for these benefits

6

to certain individuals who may have been eligible, who would

7

have been eligible to receive these dual benefits under prior

8

law.
First of all, everyone who is retired and already re­

9

20
21

ceiving benefits under both programs on the effective date of the
act, December 31, 1974, may continue to receive benefits under
both programs, including the windfall element,

although this

22
23

windfall element is not increased with the cost of living over
time.

It's frozen from the date of retirement.

24

For persons who were not yet retired in 1974, however,
25

9

1

the standards for determining eligibility for being protected
2

under the grandfather provisions depend on whether the person was
3

-- in general, on whether the person was affiliated with the
4

railroad industry in 1974 or whether he had left the industry and
5
6
7

8
9

had started to pursue other work.

Employees who were still work­

ing in the railroad industry in 1974 or had what the act terms
"a current connection" with the industry, having worked 12 out of
the preceding 30 months -- the two of them together I would call
an affiliation with the railroad industry -- those persons are

10

eligible to receive this transitional windfall benefit if they

11

had completed the necessary ten years of railroad retirement and

12

the necessary amount of social security work, ordinarily 40

13

quarters, to complete the eligibility requirements under both

14

acts by December 31, 1974, when Congress changed the law.

15

In addition to these persons who still had an affilia­

16

tion with the industry, Congress also included in this category

17

long-term employees who had 25 years of railroad service even

18

though they may have left railroad work when the 1974 act went

19

into effect.

20

21

22
23
24

Persons who had left railroad work before 1974 but
did not have the 25 years of eligibility were treated differently
under the act.

They could receive a windfall element only if

they had satisfied the length of service requirements under both
acts when they left railroad work.
is somewhat smaller.

And the

amount they received

It's under Section 3(h)(2) of the act.

25

10

1

It's smaller because the amount of the benefit is calculated on
2
the basis of what they expected to receive when they left rail­
3

road work, as opposed to later, in 1974.
4

Thus, if a person left railroad work in 1966, for
5

6
7
8
9

example, and had ten years of railroad work but had not yet
worked 40 quarters in social security, he would not be eligible
under the act to receive any windfall or carryover benefit be­
cause it was not until later that he became qualified to receive
social security benefits.

10

The present case, challenging the constitutionality of

11

thesi.e qualification provisions in Section 3(h)(1) was filed in

12

1976.

13

class of beneficiaries under the Act who had become eligible to

14

retire after 1974 when the act went into effect, but before

15

January of 1977.

16

I believe Fritz was the representative of the certified

That happened to be the span the court defined.

Persons who were eligible to retire but were not eli­

17

gible to receive the windfall benefit because they had not

18

either been affiliated with the railroad industry in 1974 or had

19

not completed the necessary qualifications under both acts in

20
21

22
23
24

whatever earlier year they may have left the railroad industry.
At least -- yes, sir?
QUESTION:

Are there bills pending in the Congress to

remedy this situation on a generous basis?

In other words, to

reextend the benefits?
MR. KNEEDLER:

There have been bills introduced in each

25

11

1

of the three -- I guess, the last two Congresses, and those bills
2

have not been enacted.
3

QUESTION:

Have they made any progress at all as far as

4

you know?
5

MR. KNEEDLER:
6

committee.

7
8
9

QUESTION:

It is true that if an employee works only

under one act, that for the same number of years -- as Mr. Fritz,
for instance, that he would receive much less.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

They have not been reported out of

If he worked only under one act in --

Under one act.

This is your windfall ap­

proach?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Right, right.

If he worked under one

14

Act -- in other words, the reduction or the exclusion from

15

eligibility for the windfall element puts him in the same posi­

16

tion as if he had worked under only one act.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23

QUESTION:

Is there any evidence in the record about

labor-management connivance in reaching this result?
MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't think there's any evidence of

labor-management connivance in -- I think a reading of the
minutes of the negotiating sessions, for example, demonstrate
that the parties, as is typical in negotiating something s.uch as
this -- there's a certain amount of give and take, but there is
no suggestion that I have found that this is motivated by some

24

animus toward persons who had left the railroad industry.
25

12

1
2
3

QUESTION:

Does the class include people who had

already retired and were eligible for the so-called double­
dipping benefits ?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it doesn't, becuase they may receive

5

the equivalent of the full benefits they expected to receive

6

under prior law, so it's not increased over time.

7
8

QUESTION:

But, as the result of the judgment that that

exception is unconstitutional also, or not?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is unclear from the judgment.

10

The judgment -- the District Court's opinion appears to find an

11

irrational distinction only on the basis of those people who

12

were affiliated with the industry in '74 and those who were not.
QUESTION:

13
14
15
16

way, are you attempting to justify a difference between that
group and the other groups, or do you think that that group is
just out of the case?
MR. KNEEDLER:

17
18
19

So are you -- well, I'll put it to you this

No, I think -- I think there are degrees

-- Congress was drafting a grandfather clause here, and there are
degrees or -QUESTION:

Must you defend that particular group,

20

though, that particular exception?
21

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think perhaps that exception

22

is -23

QUESTION:

People who have already retired and are --

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that's perhaps the strongest --

25

13

1
2
3
4
5
6

QUESTION:

But is the issue here or not, that issue?

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't believe that issue is here, no,

because the District Court perceived the inequity to be only the
difference between those who qualified who were not retired but
were in the railroad industry in '74.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, you described as the people

7

who were not entitled to participate in the windfall benefit,

8

you gave an example of the person who had ten years of railroad

9

service and less than 40 quarters of social security.

I had

10

understood -- maybe I'm wrong on this -- that if a person had

11

ten years of railroad service and 40 quarters of social security

12

service, but no 1974 connection, he would also not receive the

3
4
5
6
7
8

windfall benefit.
MR. KNEEDLER:

He would receive it if he had completed

those 40 quarters and the ten years of railroad service in the
year that he left the railroad industry.

In other words, what

the act does is look at your affiliation with the industry:

did

you become qualified when you were still affiliated with the
industry, either in '74 -- for those people who were in the in­

9

dustry when the act was passed -- or in an earlier year when they
20

were affiliated, the last year in which they were affiliated with
21

the industry, if they left before that time?
22

So, what in effect the act does is protect only those
23

dual benefits that were earned while the person was still in the
24

industry, not those of somebody who left and then earned the
25

14

1

right to dual benefits by taking on social security work.
2
QUESTION:

I see.

So that if you have a person who in

3

1966 had ten years of service in both industries, but one of then,
4

got the ten years social security service first and the other one
5
6
7

got the ten years railroad retirement service first, railroad
service first, one would get the dual benefit and the other would
not.

8
9
10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- it doesn't matter who gets

it first, if the person who was qualified under both in 1966, he
would get this windfall --

11

QUESTION:

And if 1966 marked his tenth year of non­

12

railroad work, he would not get it, but if it marked his tenth

13

year of railroad work he would get it?
MR. KNEEDLER:

14
15

his last year of railroad work.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

QUESTION:

19

Only if -- this is only true if 1966 is
That's what you're looking at.

I mean -- well, no.
So that's what --

In one example, the last year was 1965, say,

and then -MR. KNEEDLER:

20

QUESTION:

Okay.

-- he did his tenth year of --

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

In 1966?

22
QUESTION:

23

Yes.

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, he would not be eligible, because

24

he'd
25

15

1

QUESTION:

If he did it just the converse, railroad

2
work, last year 1965, social security work, last year 1966, he
3

does not get it?
4

MR. KNEEDLER:
5

6
7
8
9
10

QUESTION:

Right.

But if the other -- if the '65 and '66 are

transposed, he does get it?
MR. KNEEDLER:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

Then you -- and you do purport to defend

that distinction?
MR. KNEEDLER:

That's right.

Because what -- essen­

11

tially what Congress did was preserve the benefits that -- the

12

larger benefits under Section 3(h)(1) are for those who were

13

still affiliated with the industry in 1974 and those who had 25

14

years of service.

15

these people had the strongest equities and the report submis­

16

sions by the Joint Committee for Labor and Management said that

17

this -- indicated that this equity was because they still had an

18

attachment, affinity for the industry.

19

20
21

22
23

Congress -- the reports on the bill say that

But Congress did not

totally exclude the possibility of eligibility for people who
left before 1974.

It simply dealt with them under a different

section, and said they too can be eligible as long as they
accrued their entitlement to dual benefits when they were still
in the railroad industry.

If they left and then went out and did

their social security work afterward, then they did not accrue
24

their dual benefits while they were still in the industry.
25

16

1

QUESTION:

If a person who had ten years of -- would

2

qualify the way I described a moment ago, in addition had a cur­
3

rent connection in 1974, would that increase his benefit?

In­

4

crease his dual benefit?
5

MR. KNEEDLER:
6
7

8
9
10

QUESTION:

He would be --

He wouldn't have -- I see, he couldn't have

retired from the railroad industry under that hypothesis be­
cause -MR. KNEEDLER:

Right; that's right.

Because he comes,

because he came back in in 1974.

11

The distinction drawn here furthers a number of the

12

statutory purposes of the act, and since this does not, since

13

this act does not exclude on the basis of a suspect category,

14

or exercise of a fundamental right, it is sufficient that the

15

category be rationally related to legitimate Government purposes.

16

Now, first, this Court stated in Hisquierdo two terms

17

ago, citing the committee reports on the act in the 1930s, that

18

the purpose of the act was to provide retirement benefits for

19

persons who were pursuing careers in the railroad industry, and

20
21

22
23
24
25

so to provide them with the opportunity to live out the closing
years of their life in comfort.

Well, the line drawn under

Section 3(h)(1) accomplishes this purpose because when the act
was passed the persons who were pursuing their careers in the
railroad industry were those who were still affiliated with it,
or people who had spent 25 years in the industry by that time hac
17

1
2
3
4

pursued the major portion of their careers in .the industry.,

.The

other people who had left the industry were pursuing their ca­
reers elsewhere.
Second, in a related purpose of the act, which was

5

also identified in Hisquierdo, was to provide an incentive for

6

older workers to retire and thereby to open up more job oppor­

7

tunities for younger workers and more rapid advancement.

8

3(h)(1) is consistent with this purpose as well, because it is

9

only necessary to provide an incentive to retire for people who

Section

10

The third purpose that is served is the one that I
previously mentioned and one that's furthered by any grandfather
provision, and that is trying to accomodate the equities of per­
sons who may have been affected by a change in the law.
QUESTION:

Well, does it encourage anybody to return to

the railroad industry?
19

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the act does provide that if a

20

person returns to the industry after 1974 and had a current con­
21

nection with the industry when he retired, then he is also eli­
22
gible to receive a windfall benefit.
23

QUESTION:

So this is sort of -- has a counter influ­

24

ence as far as opening up positions in the railroad industry?
25

18

1

It brings people back to it, older people back to it?
2

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, if they came back in the industry

3

they would be eligible for the windfall benefit which would then
4

create an incentive for them to retire, so even if they did come
5

back, it creates an incentive for them to retire and therefore

actually furthers the purpose of the act.
QUESTION:

But while they're there there's no vacancy?

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's right.

There is no vacancy.

That's true.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Or a vacancy was filled?
That's correct.

Of course, in some of

12

these cases the person who came back may have been someone who

13

was laid off or had been laid off for a fair amount of time, or

14

his former railroad employer went out of business, something of

15

that nature.

16

quite strong because the act still requires that he have com­

service before 1974.

every other name, and not to the other

And the rational basis approach I've suggested is par­

16
17

ticularly appropriate in a case like this because the benefit

18

we're talking about here is not one that was designed to meet an

19

identifiable need that Congress saw on behalf of the benefi­

20
21
22
23
24

ciaries, as is the case with most welfare or social security
benefits, or even most benefits under the Railroad Retirement
Act.

This benefit was a conceded anomaly that occurred under

prior law solely by virtue of the fact that Congress decided to
have two parallel social security-type programs rather than com­
bining them into one comprehensive program.

25

20

So, this is not a situation where eliminating the bene­

where people on one side of it have what may appear to be almost

as strong equity as those people on the other side.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL P. BYRON

4

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

5

6
7

Mr. Byron.

MR. BYRON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The correct issue of this appeal is this:

did the

8

District Court commit error when it found that the Congress's

9

elimination of plaintiffs' then-vested retirement benefits

10

11

denied them equal protection under the law?
Based upon the undisputed record made below, the Dis­

12

trict Court, we submit, rightly concluded that the 1974 act's

13

classification which is here involved was utterly irrational.

14

It is my intent here to emphasize several of the primary reasons

15

why the classification is indeed irrational.

16

Number one:

I want to take up the point that we make

17

in the briefs about this being contrary, the classification be­

18

ing contrary to the actual purposes of the act.

19
20

21

Number two:

I

want to take up briefly the fact that they are contrary to the
Railroad Study Commission's recommendations made to Congress
pertinent to resolving solvency problems relevant to the act.
And number three:

the fact that regardless of the above, the

22
23

distinction made in the act between the pertinent vested classes
here to be discussed is in and of itself irrational.

24

First, the classification is contrary to the actual anc
25

23

1

declared purposes of the 1974 act.

Congress expressly declared

2
in the purposes section of the report, twice, its intent to pre­
3

serve all retirement benefits which were then vested under prior
4

law.
5
6

Indeed, the Railroad Board itself, the defendant in this

cause of action, assured Congress of this during the hearings on
this bill.

7
8
9

QUESTION:

in fact it's conceded that the legislation if read according to
its meaning has the effect that you claim is unconstitutional?

10

11

MR. BYRON:

I say that because the Railroad Board it­

self assured Congress that our class was included.

12

13

Well, Mr. Byron, how can you say that when

QUESTION:

But the Railroad Board isn't vested with the

legislative power of the United States, it's Congress.
MR. BYRON:

14

No, but I think it is easy to understand as

15

we go through the legislative history here why Congress thought

16

they were including everyone, but nevertheless did not; that the

17

plaintiff's class was actually exempted.

18

rect that Section 3(h) does exclude the plaintiffs by its opera­

19

tion.

20

21

However, I would think it defied logical analysis to read

Section 3(h)(1) and -(2) and understand who might be, who might
lose their vested benefit.
In fact, the act does not speak of vesting at all, and

22
23
24

You're absolutely cor­

when you look at the committee reports, they never mention di­
vestment.

The reports mention the concept that everybody who hac

then, were then vested under both systems, social security and
25

24

1

railroad retirement, was actually covered under the act.

And

2
they make it a primary purpose of the act.

And then they go on

3

to say -- because I pick up the point that the defense has made
4

-- that this is a windfall.
5
6
7

And they seem to be critical of the

fact that this is a so-called windfall -- which, by the way it is
not.

But they seem to be critical of that.
Congress put in the primary purposes section of this

8

statute, Congress said, "Dual beneficiaries cannot be criticized

9

because they relied upon the law as it then existed."

10

exactly what our people do.

11

of any equities that were discussed by Congress.

2

QUESTION:

And that's

They fit squarely within the pegs

Mr. Byron, do you suggest that a statute

3

enacted by the Congress is constitutionally vulnerable because

4

some erroneous information was submitted to the Congress?

5

MR. BYRON:

Mr. Justice, I've -- I'm suggesting that in

6

part based on the Delaware Tribal Systems v. Weeks, the note by

7

Justice Stevens, I believe, in there, that while the motives of

8

Congress, for example, is not -- does not -- germane to the

9

20
21

decision here.

However, it hag some relevancy as to what are the

legislative objectives of the statute.

So I'm saying it has

some relevancy; however, it is not a dispositive factor.
I think the concern here is the fact that this is

22

written into the primary purposes section of the statute and
23

they continue to pound away at the point that the Congress does
24

not mean to criticize dual beneficiaries.
25

25

And if they really

1
meant that, then they would not have meant to divest our rail­
2
roaders , who were actually covered under both laws and had fully
3

performed ten to 25 years of railroad service and were inactives
4

and had

then gone out.

5

But the point I wanted to make was the Railroad Board,
6
7
8
9

after reviewing the final bill as it pertains to 3(h), in their
written statement to Congress two of the three Railroad Board
members said this, and I ask the indulgence of the Court to just
give a very short quote:

"It is sufficient to state here that

10

existing rights to such benefits will not be adversely affected

11

by this bill."

12

This was the recommendation of the Commission on

13

Railroad Retirement and this bill so provides, and this bill

14

does just the opposite.

Yes.

There is no question.

And it does that, and the question is whe­

ther -- let's just assume there wasn't a fragment of legislative
history.

I suppose you would -- you still have the problem of

saying that it's irrational.
MR. BYRON:

Well, Mr. Justice, there is this question

22
about the rational connection to the legitimate objectives of the
23

statute, but the objectives if the statute were to cover our
24

class.

Then, if the act does the contrary, it is irrational

25

27

1

because the connection must be connected

Why?

Why?

Which is irrational?

isn't.

Maybe the, maybe somebody's statement about what the

purposes were is erroneous.

In fact, the committee

reports suggest that the Railroad Study Commission which
reported to Congress after analyzing the act for two years -reported on June 30, 1972 -- that everyone was to be protected,

The question was

put to Mr. Kneedler about the conserving of fiscal resources as
being a basis, a sine qua non for actually having this statute
pass muster with the Supreme Court.

That is not enough,

obviously, because if it were you would be saying that every
21

congressional cutback would avoid and be immunized from scrutiny
22

under the equal protection clause.

And that's not what we're

23

saying, and I don't think Mr. Kneedler is saying that either.

But on this question of conservation of fiscal re­

The 3 percent increased deficiency which was created

by the Joint Labor-Management Negotiating Committee was funded

in part, as we point out in our briefs, by a tradeoff of the

16

plaintiffs' benefits.

17

what they were supposed to be doing to resolve the actuarial

18
19

deficiency.

And that, we submit, is contrariwise to

And the act's classification was also contrary to

the Study Commission's recommendations to Congress in two ways.
Number one, the Commission strongly and repeatedly

20

urged the retention of all vested rights to retirement benefits
21

as of the new proposed changeover date, which would be December
22

31, '74.

The Commission also repeatedly stated that any

23

liberalization of benefits must -- and this is one of the few
24

times the Commission used the word "must" -- they said,
25

31

1

must be accomplished without impairing any presently vested
2
rights.
3
4
5

6
7

Further, they emphasized that liberalizations under

this act can only be funded

by an increase in taxes on employer-

employee sufficient to pay for the liberalizations.

And that

makes every sense in the world, because Congress was trying to
resolve an actuarial deficiency, not create a greater one.
But the JLMC, but what happened here is, you sent the

8

fox out to guard the chicken coop.

9

creates another 3 percent deficiency and the only way you can

And the fox goes out and

10

get that job done is to, in the words of the JLMC, "hit" or

eliminate the plaintiff class because they're inactives and they

don't have to answer to the unions anymore.

tion here --

14

QUESTION:

Now, the distinc­

Mr. Byron, are you arguing -- it seems to

15

me you're arguing that any cutback that didn't either exclude

16

all vested benefits or no vested benefits would have been uncon­

17

stitutional?

18
19
20
21

MR. BYRON:
QUESTION:

No, I am not.
But is -- well, the presentation to Congress

was, we're going to preserve all vested benefits, and you seem
to place great emphasis on the vesting concept.
MR. BYRON:

Yes, I do, because, you see, the JLMC in

22

the colloquies they engaged in in Congress assured Congress
23

everyone was being vested.

And secondly, the Commission recom­

24

mended that.

They saw the distinction here but --

25

32

QUESTION:

I understand all that, but as soon as you

admit that Congress could have constitutionally cut back on some
of the vested benefits, it seems to me your whole argument is
beside the point, the only argument you've made thus far, is
beside the point.
MR. BYRON:

Mr. Justice, it is not -- the -- because

we're looking at what the legislative objectives in this particu­
lar reported bill and statute are.

In other words, if there's

actual legislative goals and objectives of this act, and this
distinction does not further but is contrary to those goals, ther.
I submit that under equal protection analysis we must have a win
on that point.
QUESTION:

And that the goal you're relying on is the

goal to preserve all vested benefits.
MR. BYRON:
QUESTION:

Yes, and that was the goal of Congress.
Any cutback on that would have been incon­

sistent with that goal.
MR. BYRON:
ment.

Yes; now, that's just -- that's one argu­

However, I think the point is here that if Congress had

not considered this point, then I'd say that our point would not
be well taken.

But Congress here really meant to make the

dividing line between the vesteds and the non-vesteds.

And they

did that because the Railroad Board told them that was what was
being done and the JLMC told them that's what was being done,
and they also believed they were following the Commission

made some mistakes.
MR. BYRON:

18
19
20

What you're saying then is that Congress

Yes, but not just made a mistake.

I'm

saying, further, that Congress thought they were including our
class when they actually weren't because they saw, everbody saw
the dividing line here between vesteds and non-vesteds, and the

21

problem here is that the actuarial deficiency was not resolved
22

by our

class.

The problem was that they went out and made the

23

deficiency from 9 percent to 12 percent and then used our class
24

as part of the tradeoff to fund the other 3 percent.
25

35

But I think

1

-- I want to get to this point about the real distinction here,
2
3
4
5

the rational distinction between the classes, because we're only
talking here about a distinction based on timing.

It's a new

timing requirement, you see, that divided the vesteds, the simi­
larly situated vesteds, between -- all of us, all of the vesteds

6

had 10 to 25 years of railroad service and ten years of social

7

security, thereby earning a full dual benefit.

8

the first time ever, Congress in 3(h)(1) and 3(h)(2) brought

9

about this new current connection requirement and gave four dif­

10

ferent ways in which our people who were vested back on December

11

31, 1974, could continue to be vested under the new act.

However, and for

Actually, what that is is a divesting rule, and the

12

3

Government concedes that only timing of their prior railroad

4

service is the question here involved.

5

quirement, you understand, amounted to a changing of the vesting

6

rules ex post facto, i.e., after the game was played and the

7

benefit had been earned and acquired.

8
9
20

And this new timing re­

Its sole purpose as the

legislative history we've put in our brief shows, the sole pur­
pose was to "hit" and to "eliminate" the inactive railroaders
who had no -- that the unions, they felt, had no allegiance to
anymore.

Somebody had to go, in their opinion, and that was not

21

true, because as we've said, it was only true because they
22

raised the deficiency to 12 percent.
23

Timing has nothing to do with the extent or the length
24

of the railroaders' credited service.
25

36

It has nothing to do with

1
the earning or the gaining of the retirement benefit.

It is non­

2

sensical, in fact.

The timing distinction is not based on

3

character of service, length of service, or the amount of the
4

contributions of the employer or the employee.

A railroad re­

5

tirement benefit, as the Commission noted, is earned on the
6
7

basis of past service and past contributions, not present service
or some so-called tenuous connection like present affinity --

QUESTION:
pension situations

Mr. Byron, isn't it true that in a lot of
a

person who retireswith 20 years of service

10

in 1974 will get a higher pension than someone who retired with 20

11

years of service in 1970 , say,simply because there's been a deci­

12

sion to increase benefits; and therefore the timing of the date

13

of retirement has a rational -- provides a rational explanation

14

for why you get a higher benefit?
MR. BYRON:

15
16

Well, I can't -- I'm not familiar with the

hypothetical I've never seen that -QUESTION:

17

But would that be irrational?

Say there's

18

inflation and say that people amend their plan in 1974 and say

19

that from here on people who have 25 years of service will get a

20
21

22
23
24
25

greater benefit than they used to get, than the people used to
get who retired two years ago?

Isn't that all that's really

happened here? Because you're just saying

the railroad service

is the more valuable benefit, more valuable criterion for eli­
gibility,

and that happens to come later.

higher benefit.
37

Therefore, you get a

1

MR. BYRON:
2
3
4

No, that is incorrect, in our opinion.

That what we were saying here is that -- we're talking about past
earned retirement benefits, we're not talking about getting a
new benefit or an additional benefit.

5

QUESTION:

Put the vesting concept to one side.

6

derstand you are objecting to the vesting.

7

no vesting here, would my hypothetical be any different?

8

MR. BYRON:

I un­

But if there had beer,

Well, that might be the case if there were

no vesting or no actually having earned it, but if you're talk­

10

ing about non-vesteds, they're in a different category and that's

a different situation.

In that benefits pamphlet, they said,

right to this benefit.

Now, I submit that having this destroyed

equivalent of a permanent right to a benefit.
the Government.

They relied on

And what did they get for their reliance?

They

20

lost this so-called windfall.
21

And it is not a windfall.

A windfall is an unexpected

22

sum of money.

This was expected.

This was relied upon by these

23

people.

It is a windfall only because the Railroad Study Commis­

24

sion said it's an excess dual benefit if you assume, arguendo,
25

38

1

2
3
4
5

that both benefits were earned under social security.

But, of

course, since they were not earned under social security, the
hypothetical doesn't stand up and so the windfall is not there.
It's not a real windfall, it's not a gratuity that these people
were being given.

6

It was an earned retirement benefit.

Yes, Mr. Justice.

In this way:

as the Railroad Board pam­

phlet showed, if you have past service, plus in addition to that
made the necessary contributions over those particular years of

20

past service;

then you earned your permanent right to the bene­

21

fit.

So, it was a key or an element to earning the benefit.

MR. BYRON:

I'd have a tougher case than I've got right

here.

The reason is because they say this current connection

brief, a’ greater

But the protected

and they have no greater "stake" than our railroaders.

They

have, number one, no greater contributions; they have no greater
length of service; and they have no greater vesting basis.

In

fact, they have the same exact amount of time, ten to 25 years.

11

But this rule, I submit, is antithetical to a career.

12

It speaks of a current connection, not a career connection.

13

one is calling this the career connection rule.

14

suggested in Congress or anywhere else that it might be.

15

says, for example, all you need to do is have a 1974 connection

16

and you can then disregard any career notion that you might

17

have.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

No

Nor was it ever
It

Of equal importance, of course, is that neither
Congress nor the JLMC ever suggested such a connection between
the rule and a career during all the negotiations under the act.
Now, of course, trying to make career railroaders out of 10-year
men -- and the question was put to Mr. Kneedler; I think it's a
good question -- is contrary and antithetical to the purposes of
the act ever since 1937.

This is so because a major purpose of

the act is to encourage older workers.
41

They don't say career

1

workers, they say older workers -- to retire so as to encourage
2
younger workers to take their place,

and to do this in a de­

3

clining employment industry.

It moved from 1,280,000 back in the

old days to -- in the 1970s -- to 500-and-some thousand.

QUESTION:

Plaintiffs’ departure --

All of these things certainly are persua­

sive that Congress acted unwisely, possibly even unfairly.

But

how do we find out about the statute except by reading the
statute, if the language is clear?

10

MR. BYRON:

11

and the Senate reports, and --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BYRON:

We find that out by looking at the House

If the language is clear?
The language is not clear.

You know, I

14

understand that if you take the legislative history -- if you

15

take the legislative history, and you look at what the Railroad

16

Study Commission said, and you understand that Congress's de­

17

termination for dividing the classes was a vested basis, then

18

it's clear that our class was to be included.

19

as I'm saying, assuming arguendo regardless of that fact, the

20

point is, there is no rational distinction here because we are

21

22
23
24
25

But even -- but

not arguing here over a welfare benefit, for example, or a gra­
tuity, or an unexpected sum of money.

This is not a new benefit

that's being awarded.
And I want to mention, just very briefly, the fact
that historically the current connection use is negated here,
42

1

because it was never used in connection with the basic retire­
2

ment benefit, and it was never used as a divesting mechanism,
3

which is what it's used here for.

It has only been used in con­

And we wouldn't complain if that were the:

9

had.

We're asking for a benefit that our class already

It was always a reward for an additional benefit, so they

10

-- historically, it has never been used in the context here.

11

And indeed, of course, the Railroad Study Commission never con­

12

sidered it and Congress never really addressed it in the

13

hearings.

14

Now, we mention several other points that we feel

15

heighten the irrationality of the statute here involved, in­

16

cluding the reliance on benefits and the vested nature of them.

17

We also point out that the age and inability of our railroaders

18

to rework their careers -- because, you see, they're all of ad­

19

vanced age -- they cannot relive their lives; they cannot recoup

20
21

their loss by some other means of employment.

For our rail­

roaders, the loss comes about at a point when it's too late for
them to say, well, I guessed wrong, and I've got to go back.

22
23

They can't do it.

But, of course, there is no encouragement

under this act to get them back.
24

In summary, let me say that to reverse the decision of
25

43

1

the District Court in this case would be to say that the plain­
2
3
4
5
6

tiffs, whose working lives are essentially over, guessed wrong
as to that most finite and once-only resource, their own working
years and lives; that what they were told by Congress were the
requirements for vesting, and what they were told would be their
reward for staying with the industry for ten years --

QUESTION:

Mr. Byron, could you give me an example so

8

I'll understand it better of a man who could have made a differ­

10

MR. BYRON:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
24

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT -- REBUTTAL
25

46

1
MR. KNEEDLER:

Just several points I wanted to make.

2

We submit that it is not necessary to look beyond the plain
3

meaning of the language of the act to determine that the Appellee
4

class was excluded, but if it were, the committee reports on
5

6
7

page 12 of each report could not be clearer.

They both say it

in identical language, "Under the bill" -- referring to the peo­
ple who had left the railroad industry before '74 -- they would nt>t

8

receive a dual benefit upon retirement unless they also had full}

9

qualified under social security by the close of the year prior

10

to '75 in which they left railroad service.

11

If they had so qualified under both systems at that

12

point, however, they would receive dual benefits.

13

plainly knew what it was doing.

14

that all, that Congress really had to take an all-or-nothing

15

approach.

16

vested benefits, which I think are more properly referred to as

17

an expectation of receiving benefits under prior law.

18

had the choice of either wiping them all out or wiping none of

19

them out, and could not take a middle course.

20
21

So Congress

Secondly, Appellee suggests

It either had to wipe out what he refers to as

Congress

The Congress was faced with a serious financial prob­
lem in the railroad retirement account.

And Congress tried to

accommodate the financial needs of the system against what are
22
inevitably degrees of equity among people who may have had ex­
23

pectations under prior law.
24

The concept of reliance really has no basis here,
25

47

because as was pointed out in Hisquierdo these benefits are not
