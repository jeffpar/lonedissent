ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD 0. BURST, SR., ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURST:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The case that I present to the Court today, I think,

9

10

is limited in issue and scope, and briefly stated, simply

11

involves where a trial court in Louisiana after hearing the

12

evidence, sustained a motion for a new trial on the basis of

13

insufficient evidence and the defendant was retried.

14

quently, before appeal became final, this Court rendered a de­

15

cision in Burks v. United States.

16

Louisiana Supreme Court on a writ, first by writ of habeas

17

corpus to the district court, and then by writ of habeas corpus

18

to the Louisiana Supreme Court on certiorari.

The case was taken to the

The Supreme Court issued an opinion denying our re­

Subse­

lief after accepting cert, and that's what brings us to this
Court.

We take issue with the ruling of the Supreme Court of

Louisiana basically on two areas where I feel that they have
based their opinion on two faulty premises.

it decided the case?

QUESTION:

Well, we take our State procedure and

11

state procedural remedies as we find them in this Court.

12

And it would appear to me that from Justice Tate's opinion and

13

from the majority opinion, they treat the motion that was made

14

as a 13th-juror type of motion, which Burks left open.

15

MR. BURST:

They do treat it, but they treat it on

16

the same basis as this Court discussed in Jackson v. Virginia.

17

In other words, they applied it on a no

ficient evidence.

Justice Blanche quoted it in the Supreme
In the first paragraph he uses the term,

1

"solely for lack of sufficient evidence to sustain the jury's

verdict."

3

Then, on page 48, in reference to discussing Burks,

4

he states that this Court decided and reversed on the issue of

5

solely for lack of sufficient evidence to sustain the jury's

verdict.

9

QUESTION:

Well, then you would have to disavow

Justice Tate's concurring opinion, wouldn't you?
MR. BURST:

Yes, I would.

I further -- I feel that

10

also in Justice Tate's concurring opinion that he simply states

11

facts that were not mentioned by the trial judge in his ruling.

12

I think the trial judge's ruling is concise and if there is

13

any ambiguity at all in the trial judge's ruling, it would be

14

by virtue of the precise language he used where he said that

21

22
23
24

"I viewed the same evidence, that in the present case I heard tl e
same evidence the jury did.

I am convinced that there was no

evidence, certainly not evidence beyond a reasonable doubt
to sustain the verdict of homicide committed by the defendant
on this particular victim" and the only ambiguity there is
whether he was applying a no-evidence rule or insufficient evi­
dence beyond a reasonable doubt.

And I think that that's

really a difference without a distinction, that he -QUESTION:

Well, wasn't he saying in the alternative

I see no evidence whatever, but if I'm wrong on that then my
fallback position is, there was not evidence beyond a

25

5

1

reasonable doubt?

2

MR. BURST:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And I feel --

Mr. Burst, isn't that even ambiguous,

4

because can't one read that to mean, either not sufficient evi

5

dence from which a jury could have no reasonable doubt, on the

6

basis of which a jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable

7

doubt, or not sufficient evidence to convince me, the judge,

8

beyond a reasonable doubt?
MR. BURST:

I was not -QUESTION:

14

Well, which way does it mean?

Does it

15

mean he doesn't think there's enough evidence to convince him

16

beyond a reasonable doubt, or not enough to have submitted to

17

the jury, and if he means the latter why did he submit it to

18

the jury?

25

Louisiana laws that existed then did not permit a trial
In 1975, and

prior to that time -- and I have both sections cited in my
brief -- prior to '75 there was an ability of the trial judge
to, in effect, sustain a motion for directed verdict.
QUESTION:

Did they have authority to enter a
6

1

judgment notwithstanding verdict at that time?

2
3

MR. BURST:

In '75.

Not at the time of this trial

they did not.

4

QUESTION:

Well, at the time of this trial, couldn’t

the judge at the end of the trial have said what he said to

6

himself here, and therefore I am entering judgment for the

7

defendant of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict?

8

do that at that time?
MR. BURST:

9

No, sir.

Could he

The first and only vehicle

10

that a defendant has in Louisiana to raise the issue of insuf­

1 1

ficient evidence is a motion for new trial, and that's it.

12

And that was the law at the time this was tried, that is sub­

13

sequent --

MR. BURST:

Wouldn't you expect him to have

I'm not sure I understand your question.

QUESTION: Well, I mean, it seems to me he is saying
that what the trial judge did is to say that the question the
trial judge answered was the one posed by Justice Stevens or
by the Chief Justice.

But there was not enough evidence here

to satisfy me, had I been sitting as a juror, beyond a reason­
able doubt?
MR. BURST:

Well, that would be the second part of

my answer to Justice Stevens.

And that would be that even if
7

1

that’s what he was saying, that's what the law required him

2

to do, and specifically, precisely that.

3

at that point in time, if in his opinion there was insufficient

4

evidence, then he was to so hold.

5

placed the case in a position where it cannot be retried under

6

our Constitution.
QUESTION:

7

In other words, if

And by so holding he has

Well, then you're saying, I take it, that

8

a statute which required a judge to submit this question to the:

9

jury when there was in fact no evidence, would in itself be

10

unconstitutional.

Is that your position?

MR. BURST:

1 1

No, sir. It would not be, because I feel

12

that there is no constitutional guarantee of a motion for

13

directed verdict, or even for an appeal for that matter.

14

I feel that as long as all people are treated alike, it makes .

15

no difference.

16

Louisiana law, there is no motion for directed verdict avail­

17

able to the defendant in a jury trial and the first time, by

18

their law, that he can raise the issue of insufficient evi­

19

dence is on motion for new trial.

All I'm saying is that in this case, in

I don't think that that in

20

and of itself is unconstitutional, but I do feel that in this

21

case that the ruling of the trial judge could not have been

22
23
24

25

clearer.

Indeed, the entire ruling which is transcribed for

the Court, it sets the basis for his ruling, what he observed,
and the factual basis.
QUESTION:

You have to treat his statement, then,
8

1

as Hr. Justice Stevens pointed out, as a statement that no rea­

2

sonable juror could reasonably find guilt on the evidence,

don't you?

That would be taking his statement most favorably

QUESTION:

MR. BURST:

Yes, sir, and the existing law, at that

time,

17

If they -- in effect, what they were saying was, if you move

18

for a new trial, you waive the argument to your constitutional

19

double jeopardy.

the' State

I'm

from,

that was the law.

But I think that is particularly innocuous

here, because under Louisiana law it was the only vehicle he
had.

You know, if you 're requiring a man, he can't waive that

issue until a motion for a new trial, and then at the same
time, you're saying, but if you do raise it you waive your
double jeopardy argument.

And that's why I think that this

particular statutory system is possibly unconstitutional.
9

1

If it were applied in a meaning where you said, because I asked

2

for a new trial, I do waive my right to raise double jeopardy,

3

then I think it's unconstitutional, as requiring him to choose

4

between two constitutional safeguards.

5

QUESTION:

Well, in a motion for a new trial for

6

error in the admission or rejection of evidence, is there a

7

waiver of any double jeopardy claimed there?
MR. BURST:

8
9

No, sir, because double jeopardy does,

as this Court clearly set out in Burks, that that is not a

10

jeopardy question, where it's an error of law, and where it's

1 1

simply both sides need a different, or a new chance to put on

12

and correct that error.

13

said

14

cient evidence the state doesn't get a second chance.

15

this case is what they got, and indeed they came forth at the

16

second trial with an eyewitness, ten months later.

But this Court has, I think, clearly

in Burks that where there's a failure to muster suffi­
And in .

The second position, I think, that is -- again, I

17

18

will use this.term "faulty premise" that the Louisiana Supreme

19

Court is using, is simply that they are attempting to apply

20

the no evidence rule on both ends.

21

the trial judge says, merely insufficient evidence.

22
23
24

25

On one end they're saying
And I

would say, and my argument is that that is, when you say it's
insufficient beyond a reasonable doubt, you've said it all.
But then,

on the other hand, to try to apply the no evidence

rule under existing Louisiana procedure, and say, because we
10

1

have a dichotomy between no evidence and insufficient evidence

2

that we are not going to apply, in essence, the Burks deci­

3

sion of the standard of reasonable doubt, as In Re: Winship.

4

I think there, from both ends, that their premise is faulty.

5

And I would assert that as recently as 1980, May of 1980, the

6

court of Louisiana, the Supreme Court of Louisiana, has main­

7

tained their position, and that is, they have said that in the

8

case of -- if I may have a drink of water.

9

in the State v. Custard

In May of 1980,

-- it's the state court of Louisiana,

10

they stated then that "This court has yet fully to embrace

1 1

Jackson v. Virginia."

12

laid to rest the dichotomy between the no evidence rule and

13

the application of the rule of insufficient evidence beyond a

14

reasonable doubt, and adopted, and indeed said that even on

15

federal, and I recognize that Jackson is a very limited opin­

16

ion, and it's limited to habeas corpus review by federal dis­

17

trict judges.

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

25

And that's where this Court, I think,

Now, I think this case that is now before this Court
here is the next logical sequence, or logical step, in apply­
ing that standard in requiring the states through the Four­
teenth and the Fifth Amendments to adhere to that standard.
And the footnotes in this case by the Louisiana Supreme Court
fully state that they haven't made up their mind whether or
not they're going to follow that standard.

And I think

that's what we're asking this Court to do is to give direction
11

1

to the Supreme Court of Louisiana and advise them that they

2

will have to embrace the reasonable doubt standard.

wording of the trial judge could not have been clearer on what

14

he was deciding it under.
QUESTION:

15

Well, as Justice Stevens suggests, that

his statement can be understood to mean that he as a so-called

12

whether he's sitting as a 13th juror or what, at a point in

13

time where a reviewing court, whether it be the trial judge

14

or an appellate court, cites that the evidence was insuffi­

15

cient beyond a reasonable doubt and at the point in time that

16

becomes final, I believe that the man is acquitted.
QUESTION:

17

And I -- perhaps I'm

Well, if the trial judge didn't do it

18

here, certainly the Supreme Court of Louisiana didn't do it

19

here .
MR. BURST:

20
21

22
23
24

25

The Supreme Court of Louisiana takes

the position that under their laws that exist, they cannot
review a decision unless there's a finding of no evidence at
all.
QUESTION:

Well, so you have to rely on the trial

judge's conclusion to support your hypothesis that when a
13

1

judge declares that no reasonable person could have found

2

guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, that is the end of the case

3

as far as double jeopardy, because certainly it is not the

4

position of the Supreme Court of Louisiana.

5

MR. BURST:

At

this

point,

that is accurate.

But

6

if this Court were to require the Supreme Court of Louisiana

7

to adhere to the standard of not guilty or

8

evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, then it's only by case

9

law that they have interpreted into their cases the standard

10

of insufficient

of no evidence.

1 1

12

Well, that's true of 49 other states too.

Let me pursue that with one more question.

Are you telling us that whenever a judge, a trial judge -forget the old Louisiana statute -- any trial judge, who dis­
agrees with the jury's verdict of guilt because as a juror he

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. BULLERS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6
7

If you wish to save any

MR. BULLERS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I agree with Mr. Burst that this really is limited

10

and involves interpretation of the particular statutes that

1 1

our Code of Criminal Procedure has dealing with new trials.

12

The State’s position is that the trial judge, when

13

he made the comment, he said that "I heard the same evidence

14

the jury did."

15

Then he went on to say, "I'm convinced."

It does appear somewhat ambiguous, of course.

As

16

I said, the State's position is that he was stating his opin­

17

ion after he had heard the same evidence that the jury heard.

18

Now, the trial judge at that time didn't have the benefit of

19

Burks and Jackson v. Virginia.

20
21

22
23
24

25

The problem that we run into is

that in commenting on the evidence it would seem to the State
that the best answer is, what does the record really reflect?
We have an article for a new trial which deals with five sub­
sections, and though the judge may call up one subsection or
another, he could be in error.

And really, it does appear

that the test would be, what does the record really reflect?
23

1

Of course, the State's position was, we agree with

2

Judge Tate that, although because the trial judge did not have

3

the benefit of Burks and Jackson, he didn't articulate partic­

4

ularly and he did not assign one particular subsection or

5

another.

reflects ?

But even if he had, isn't it really what the record

Yes, I agree with that, Your Honor.

At that time -QUESTION:

13

Even if he did find that there was no

14

evidence whatsoever, the extent of his power was to grant a

15

new trial as a matter of judgment of the court.
MR. BULLERS:

16

Yes, sir, that's correct.

At that

17

point, that's what it was.

Do you mean that?

MR. BULLERS:

No, I said, what I meant was, to what

Should he be required to evaluate

the evidence and to what extent should he interject himself

MR. BULLERS:

he had to submit the case to the jury even if he thought there

was insufficient evidence to go to the jury?

MR. BULLERS:

trial.

Exactly.

He would have to grant a new

Then we get back to, did he grant it under Subsection

1, which was -- as the grounds for that is that the verdict
was contrary to the law and evidence, or was it some other
grounds?

And of course, Justice Tate in his opinion felt that

it was more in the interest of justice.

The State from our

point of view gave the defendant a fair trial and he was
convicted by a jury of his peers, and the judge said, in his
language, "I'm not convinced"— that's our interpretation of
it -- and granted a new trial, which was the procedure at that

25

27

1

2

time, that was his remedy.
QUESTION:

We agree to that.

Is there anything at all in the record

3

that supports Judge Tate's view that -- and I know he's an

4

awfully good judge and usually is pretty careful about what he

5

does -- but is there anything in the record to support his

6

view that the judge relied on Section Five?

7

MR. BULLERS:

No, Your Honor, the judge didn't

8

state that.

Obviously, Judge Tate in his reviewing the entire

9

case felt that's what it was.

He obviously differed in the

10

opinion of the judge -- that when the judge said there was no

1 1

evidence then he clarified that and said, at least, or cer­

12

tainly not beyond a reasonable doubt. Judge Tate obviously dis­

13

agreed with that because he said he felt that the record showed

14

sufficient evidence to give it to

15

the jury.

So that, in his opinion, it should have been five

16

instead of one, and it goes back to, since the trial judge

17

didn't articulate, and even if he had it still seems that

18

it's actually what the record shows.

19

20
21

22
23
24

I don't see any other

way, unfortunately.
QUESTION:

What is the status of your procedure now?

Is there an option open to the judge to grant a directed ver­
dict notwithstanding -MR. BULLERS:

Well, it's still as it is now, is my

understanding also.
QUESTION:

It's still the same way?

MR. BULLERS:

QUESTION:

That's right.

If your procedure allowed a directed

verdict, and the district and the trial judge entered a verdict

of not guilty notwithstanding the judgment, would you say that

would bar another trial?

Do you have any other questions?

I'm not sure that's accurate,

I didn't handle the trial.

The record shows that there was another witness that was not
available or not found that didn't testify at the first trial,
that did testify at the second.
