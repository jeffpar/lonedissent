MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Buscemi.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT IN NO. 79-1538 S

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES IN NO. 79-1596

8

MR. BUSCEMI:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case, like the one that follows it, involves

1 1

several challenges to the constitutionality of the Surface

12

Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.

13

This case is here on direct appeal from the United

14

States District Court for the Western District of Virginia.

15

The original plaintiffs were an association of coal mining

16

companies and 63 of its members.

17

intervened as a plaintiff in the District Court.

18

The Commonwealth of Virginia,

The primary constitutional provisions involved are

19

the Commerce Clause, Article I, Section 8; the Tenth Amend­

20

ment; and the Just Compensation and Due Process Clauses of

21

the Fifth Amendment.

22

questions in that order after I first describe the statutory

23

provisions that are at issue here in the overall statutory

24

scheme for regulating surface mining of coal.

25

I plan to address the constitutional

For present purposes the critical portion of the
3

1

statute Is Title V which is entitled, "Control of Environ­

2

mental Impacts of Surface Coal Mining."

3

Act establishes a two-stage program for the regulation of

4

surface mining.

5

interim stage in the Secretary's regulations, mine operators

6

are required to comply with only some of the performance

7

standards set up by the Act.

8

ing this interim stage are the so-called steep slope provi­

9

sions in Section 515(d).

Section 501 of the

During the initial stage, also called the

Among the ones applicable dur­

They apply to surface mining on

10

slopes greater than 20 degrees.

11

to avoid the placement of debris, spoil material, or aban­

12

doned equipment on the downslope beneath the mining cut.

13

They further require restoration of the mining site to its

14

approximate original contour after mining is completed, and

15

complete coverage of the so-called high wall, which is the

16

vertical face of the mine cut.

17

They require mine operators

Another portion of the Act that becomes immediately

18

effective during the interim period is Section 522(e),

19

particularly 522(e)(4) and -(5), which with various qualifi­

20

cations and exceptions prohibit surface mining altogether

21

within specified distances of roads, schools, churches, parks,

22

public buildings, and cemeteries.

23

During the interim period the Secretary of the

24

Interior is primarily responsible for enforcing the Act.

25

interim regulatory program remains in effect in each state

The

until a permanent program has been established in that state.

2

States wishing to assume primary responsibility for regulation

3

of surface coal mining during the permanent phase must submit

4

to the Secretary a proposed permanent program demonstrating,

5

first, that the state legislature has

6

laws implementing the environmental protection standards es­

7

tablished by the Act.

8

administrative and the technological capability to enforce

9

those standards.

QUESTION:

adopted the necessary

And second, that the state has the

Mr. Buscemi, supposing that that statute

11

at the phase you now describe didn't talk about coal at all,

12

it simply talked about the desirability of zoning on a na­

13

tional level, and Congress passed a law saying that for any

14

state that doesn’t zone land and keep a certain amount of

15

prime farm land in existence that is now in existence, we

16

will supersede that state's regulatory power with our own

17

zoning act.

18

Clause to do that?

19

Do you think it has the power under the Commerce

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, I'm not sure that I completely

20

appreciate the question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because I'm

21

not sure that I understand the factual underpinning that

22

Congress would have for that sort of regulation.

23

to that question and hypotheticals of that kind is essentially

24

that if Congress finds, and has a rational basis for finding,

25

that a particular situation that exists in the states is

My answer

affecting interstate commerce.

2

method that's rationally related to the protection of the

3

regulation of interstate commerce, the statute is constitu­

4

tional.

5

the statute that you've just suggested, but I think that the

6

test would be the same as it is here.

7

And if Congress devises a

I'm not sure what the justification would be for

QUESTION:

Well, in Chief Justice Hughes' opinion

8

in Jones S Laughlin v. NLRB, when he was upholding the

9

National Labor Relations statute, he said that, regarding

10

the Commerce Clause, "Undoubtedly the scope of this power

1 1

must be considered in the light of our dual system of govern­

12

ment and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon

13

interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace

14

them in view of our complex society would effectually oblit­

15

erate the distinction between what is national and what is

16

local and create a completely centralized government."

17

Now, does the Government take the position that the

18

law has gone so much beyond that that that is no longer the

19

limit on the Commerce Clause?

20

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think

21

that the Court's decision in National League of Cities v.

22

Usery establishes that there is some impact of the federal

23

system of government, our state system, the Tenth Amendment,

24

or the federal system of government generally, however you

25

want to characterize that decision, on the exercise of the
6

1

commerce power.

2

Hughes'

3

avowed.

And so I don't think that Mr. Chief Justice

statement that you've just read can be completely dis­
We don't take that position here.
QUESTION:

4

Then, do you think that Congress after

5

reciting the history of surface farm lands in Oklahoma being

6

blown over into Kansas and other places, back in the '30s,

7

could require under the Commerce Clause that all farmers

8

plough their land with contour plowing as distinguished from

9

straight line plowing?

10

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, again, my

11

answer to that question is essentially the same as it was to

12

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

13
14

My question gives you a concrete, speci­

fic statute, though.
MR.

15

BUSCEMI:

Well, I have to confess ignorance as

16

to the situation in the Dust Bowl in the '30s, and as to the

17

impact of contour plowing as opposed to some other kind of

18

plowing --

19

QUESTION:

Well, assuming -- add

to

it

the con­

20

gressional recital that scientific research and practice has

21

demonstrated that contour plowing will preserve the soil for

22

future generations.

23

MR. BUSCEMI:

I assume, Mr. Chief Justice, that if

24

Congress rationally found that the failure to adopt a particu­

25

lar method of plowing or a particular method of cultivating

7

1

farmlands had an adverse effect on interstate commerce and

2

if Congress further rationally concluded that regulation of

3

the method of plowing would help to alleviate that effect,

4

that Congress could regulate that sort of agricultural activ­

5

ity, just as Congress has in fact regulated agricultural

6

cultivation, for example, with the pricing regulations and

7

also with the farm subsidy laws.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, but they've done that by use of

the power of the purse, granting subsidies if farmers com­

10

plied with certain regulations.

1 1

requirement that all farmers on certain findings engage in

12

contour plowing.

13

I'm talking about a flat

Do you think they might be able to do it?

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that

14

the findings are critical.

15

can be so lightly assumed in the hypothetical, because Con­

16

gress here, in the Surface Mining Act, as it has in the other

17

Commerce Clause legislation that the Court has sustained,

18

has very carefully examined exactly the situation that did

19

prevail and has determined that particular adverse effect on

20

interstate commerce did exist.

21

willing to assume that Congress has made all the necessary

22

findings and Congress has determined that there is a rational

23

relationship between --

QUESTION:

That is not the sort of thing that

The word necessary presupposes the

answer a little bit, doesn't it?
8

MR. BUSCEMI:

1

That's essentially what I'm trying to

2

say, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

assumption you are presupposing the answer.

4

really is, what is the basis for the congressional action,

5

and that's something that, you know, we can only talk about

6

in connection -QUESTION:

7

I think that once you make that
The question

The basis would be that the United States

8

Department of Agriculture says it knows more about farming

9

and soil conservation than the states do, and Congress accepts

10

that.

11

MR. BUSCEMI:

But, Mr. Chief Justice, that's not

12

the situation we have here.

13

lengthy investigation by Congress into surface mining and its

14

adverse effects on commerce, and we have the legislative his­

15

tory that we've set out in the Appendix of our brief in this

16

case which demonstrates, I think, that Congress has taken a

17

very close look at surface mining and its effects on inter­

18

state commerce, and I don't --

19

QUESTION:

We have a very careful, detailed,

Mr. Buscemi, what does that investiga­

20

tion show the effect on commerce is or may be if there is

21

surface mining of coal without restoring the -- say, the

22

high wall?

23

MR. BUSCEMI:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, I think, Mr. Justice White --

I can understand why surface mining might

be said to affect commerce, but that wouldn't mean that
9

1

anything that Congress said, ordered with respect to surface

2

mining would have an effect on commerce.
MR. BUSCEMI:

3

I think that's correct, Mr. Justice

4

White, but I think in particular the high wall regulation

5

that you, or the high wall statutory provision that you refer

6

to is very closely connected to preventing adverse environ­

7

mental effects from surface mining.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, you mean anything that affects

the environment affects commerce?
MR. BUSCEMI:

10

I think that the --

Is that your suggestion?

Well, I think that that is one of

11

the kinds of effects on commerce that Congress can consider,

12

and I think that in this case that Congress has found that

13

there is substantial environmental damage caused by surface

14

mining.
QUESTION:

15

Well, what if -- what if Virginia had a

16

law that required, when you surface mine on these steep areas

17

that when you're through mining you flatten them and cover

18

them.

19

powered to say, because of its effect on commerce, would be

20

empowered to say, no, you may not flatten them, you must re­

21

build them and reestablish their original contour?

22
23
24
25

Now, you suggest that the United States would be em­

MR. BUSCEMI:

Subject, of course, to the test that

it would have to bear a rational relationship.
QUESTION:

Well, I'm asking you what that is.

What

difference does it make to commerce whether they flatten the
10

1

land and cover it or restore it to the contour?

2

I’m asking you.
MR.

3

BUSCEMI:

That's what

I understand, Mr. Justice White, but

4

in point of fact, in this statute, under Section 515, it is

5

permissible to flatten the land.

6

method is specifically authorized by the statute so that

7

Congress has not prevented that sort of activity.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

The mountaintop removal

So you suggest that if miners want to

not restore its original contour in these steep places, they
need not?
MR.

11

BUSCEMI:

That's correct.

They can use the

12

mountaintop removal method of mining which essentially slices off

13

the peak of the mountain rather than gouging out strips along

14

the side of the mountain.
QUESTION:

15

Well, so you're not answering my ques­

16

tion, again.

17

out and strip mine the way you're doing it, but then flatten

18

it.

19

flatten, make it flat, and cover it.

20

could nevertheless require that they restore the contour

21

under the Commerce Clause?

22

Suppose that Virginia says, go ahead and gouge

Instead of recontouring the area, flatten it out, just

MR. BUSCEMI:

Now, the United States

I'm not sure specifically what you

23

mean by flattening it and covering it, but in fact, again

24

with respect to the strip mining, the surface mining on the

25

side of the mountain, the steep slope provisions do provide
11

1

variances that will allow the maintenance of flat benchland

2

if that is necessary for public use or a higher economic use.
QUESTION:

3
4

what the effect on commerce is.
MR. BUSCEMI:

5

6

What the effect on commerce is of

strip mining?
QUESTION:

7

8

Well, you still haven't suggested to me

No, of not restoring the contour but

flattening it and covering it some other way.
MR. BUSCEMI:

9

Well, Mr. Justice White, I refer you

10

to the findings that Congress made in Section 101 of the

1 1

statute.
QUESTION:

12
13

you can tell me what -QUESTION:

14
15

Well, don't refer me, I want to ask --

We have no way of reviewing those

findings.

16

MR. BUSCEMI:

17

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

18

Congress's findings with respect to the environmental impact

19

that surface mining has.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Well, that's precisely my point,
Section 101 of the statute contains

Well, you go ahead and tell me what

impact on commerce it has.
MR. BUSCEMI:

In

That's what I'm asking you.
Section 101 of the statute

23

Congress has found that coal mining operations contribute

24

significantly to the nation's energy requirements, that sur­

25

face mining results in disturbance of surface areas, that
12

1

burden and adversely affect commerce by destroying and

2

diminishing the utility of land for commercial, industrial,

3

residential, recreational, agricultural, and forestry pur­

4

poses by causing erosion and landslides, by contributing to

5

floods, by polluting the water, by destroying fish and wild­

6

life habitats, by impairing natural beauty, by damaging the

7

property of citizens, by creating hazards dangerous to life

8

and property -QUESTION:

9

I can understand all of that but I still

10

don't identify in that listing any specific impact on commerce

11

by a failure to restore the original contour when these

12

steep places are mined.
MR. BUSCEMI:

13

Well, I think, Mr. Justice White, the

14

question is not whether every individual failure to restore

15

a particular surface mine to its approximate original contour

16

has a substantial effect on commerce.

17

whether

18

a substantial effect on commerce.

19

Rather, the question is

Congress can regulate this entire activity that has

QUESTION:

So your answer to me is that it doesn't

20

make any difference whether this particular phase that's

21

regulated has any effect on commerce, as long as strip mining

22

is subject to regulation, that's the end of the s-- ?

23

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, it certainly doesn't make any

24

difference whether you can point to a particular mine and

25

identify the particular effect on commerce from that mine.
13

1

That is certainly correct.
QUESTION:

2

Well, I'm still a little puzzled. Do you

3

take the position that the general practice for mines as a

4

whole of requiring the restoration of the slope does in fact

5

have some impact on commerce by preventing the various things

6

that Congress found, such as erosion and floods and so forth

7

and so on?

Do you take that position?

8

MR. BUSCEMI:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

Or are you taking the more extreme posi­

10

tion that you don't even have to have that as long as the

1 1

activity is regulated, is subject to regulation?

12

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, I think that with respect to

13

the form of regulation that Congress chooses, there must be a

14

rational relationship between that regulation and the protec­

15

tion and the regulation of commerce.

16

is free to say surface mining is subject to regulation --

17

QUESTION:

I don't think Congress

What your answer to Mr. Justice White,

18

then, is, is that some of the things that you read are in

19

fact, looking at the class of activity as a whole, related to

20

commerce.

21

MR. BUSCEMI:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BUSCEMI:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.
Which is different from the -- all right.
Now, I want to make the point --

Can you give us an example or two of

what would be the negative impact on commerce?
14

Flush that out

1

a little.
MR. BUSCEMI:

2

I really don't know how to respond to

3

that except by saying that the list that I just read, I think,

4

indicates that there is a substantial effect on commerce.

5

Certainly -QUESTION:

6

Well, because Congress says so doesn't

7

make it true, necessarily.

8

concrete illustrations, as to what you think Congress was

9

driving at.
MR.

10

BUSCEMI:

I'm asking you for illustrations,

Well, I think, Mr. ChiefiJustice, for

11

example, the Buffalo Creek flood disaster, which we've cited

12

or mentioned in one of the briefs and which is mentioned in

13

the congressional reports, is the kind of disaster that Con­

14

gress is trying to avert through regulating surface mining,

15

and I think that where hundreds of lives are lost, there's no

16

question of the -QUESTION:

17
18
19

it?

That's not a Commerce Clause issue, is

The loss of lives?
MR. BUSCEMI:

I think, for example, that if you loo]<

20

at the child labor legislation that this Court upheld under

21

the Commerce Clause in Darby, there's no question that Con­

22

gress can try to pursue other ends in the exercise of its

23

Commerce Clause power.

24
25

I want to make the point that as far as I can under­
stand their argument, plaintiffs don't disagree with any of

15

1

what we've been saying so far.

2

Surface Mining Act affects land use and land use is something

3

that is committed exclusively by the Constitution to the

4

states, and that that's why this statute exceeds

5

Commerce Clause.

6

McCready v. Virginia in 1877, and they talk about the separa­

7

tion of production and commerce.

8

Darby and in Jones 8 Laughlin which Mr. Justice Rehnquist re­

9

ferred to, and 5 n Wickard v. Filburn, and Brightwood Dairy arid a

10

host of other cases, that the rigid separation of production and

11

commerce is no longer the rule that's followed by this Court.

12

Their point is that the

the

And they cite this Court to the decision in

QUESTION:

But, as the Court held in

But if there is no rigid separation,

13

then it seems to me you're just pushing it to the outer edge

14

and saying that Congress can supersede any state authority by

15

simply a set of findings which are unreviewable in this

16

Court, or any other court.

17

MR.

BUSCEMI:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that,

18

for example, in your dissent in this Court in Fry v. United

19

States, you make the point that there is a very broad discre­

20

tion in Congress to make findings, and that's part of what

21

Congress is entitled to do, and you made that point, I be­

22

lieve, in the connection of United States v. California, which

23

you specifically said you thought was a correct decision be­

24

cause Congress had made certain findings about the impact of

25

railroad hazards on public safety and on commerce.
16

It is true

1

that Congress does have an extremely broad factfinding capa­

2

bility and discretion, but I don't -- that does not mean that

3

there is no review whatsoever.

4

for a factual finding that Congress has made, and I think

5

that the legislative record in this case, which includes

6

volumes and volumes of hearings and evidence of the negative

7

effects that surface mining has had, demonstrates that there

8

is a basis for the congressional findings.

9

There must be a rational basis

Now, there are, by the way, a number of federal

10

statutes that affect land use.

11

any question about that, and I'm not sure exactly what the

12

district court and what appellees mean when they say that

13

Congress is not free to effect land use, because, for example,

14

the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, the historical

15

preservation statutes innthe Federal Code that we discussed

16

in the Grand Central Station brief, the Wild and Scenic Rivers

17

Act, a number of these statutes have effects on land use, and

18

plaintiffs, I don't believe, contend that all of those sta­

19

tutes go beyond the Commerce Clause.

20

the phrase "land use" that's sacrosanct under the Constitution

21

I mean, the Constitution does not say that states are the

22

only governmental entities entitled to regulate land use.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

I don't think there can be

There's nothing about

There was something about powers not

expressly granted having been reserved, isn't there somewhere:
MR. BUSCEMI:

That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, but
17

1

here the Commerce Clause power is expressly granted.

2

precisely the point.

3

QUESTION:

That's

Well, we've been trying, I think, several

4

of us to get a specific focus on just how it affects inter­

5

state commerce.

6

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think I've

7

given my best answer to that question.

8

has found that it affects interstate commerce in several

9

ways and I think that those findings are rational findings

I think that Congress

and they're supported by the evidence in the legislative recorc ,

1 1

in the committee reports, in the hearings, and so on.

12

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, even the record in the

13

district court in this case provides several examples of --

14

the district court's own opinion says that in the absence of

15

this legislation, or if this legislation is invalidated, there

16

will be negative consequences, not only for coal mining it­

17

self, but also for the safety and the health of the people in

18

mining communities.

QUESTION:

20

21

Now, of course -On this issue, you're the respondent,

aren't you?
MR.

BUSCEMI:

That's exactly right.

That's

22

exactly the point I was just about to make, because from

this point --

QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals held In your favor

on this Issue?
18

MR. BUSCEMI:

1

the district court ruled in our

2

favor.

That's not true in the Indiana case, but the district

3

court here sustained the statute on the Commerce Clause

4

ground.

5

or Federal System argument emerges to some extent in -- this

6

Court

7

there was unquestionably valid under the Commerce Clause,

8

but that the Tenth Amendment or the state-federal relation­

9

ship in our constitutional system imposed some limitations on

Now, admittedly, this Commerce Clause-Tenth Amendment

in

National League of Cities said that the statute

Congress's power to exercise the Commerce Clause delegated

1 1

power.

12

there was no question that the Commerce Clause power alone

13

was sufficient to justify the congressional action.

14

question is whether there was some additional limit.

So that that was -- even in National League of Cities

15

The

And that brings me to the first point on which the

16

district court ruled against the Secretary, and that is on

17

this Tenth Amendment argument.

18

ferent from the one that the Court considered in National

19

League of Cities, and the reaffirmation of the decision in

20

United States v. California, in National League of Cities, I

21

think

22

had a federal statute that was being applied directly to the

23

states.

This statute ctoes not apply directly to the states in

24

any way.

This statute applies only to coal mine operators.

25

The Federal Government does not require the states to

But this statute is far dif­

is very instructive because there, in California, we

19

1

undertake any measures whatsoever.

If the states do not

2

wish to participate in the regulatory program that the federal,

3

statute establishes, they need not do so.

4

so, they can submit a proposed program to the Secretary and

5

-- by the way, there is a substantial amount of discretion

6

left to the states in those proposed programs.

7

Section 101(f) of the Act Congress itself stated that because

of the diversity in terrain and climate, chemical and other

And I think that Congress has tried to strike the

21

balance in a fair way here between the state and the federal

22

government without requiring the states to do anything.

23

The states may -- there is a substantial amount of leeway in

24

framing these proposed permanent programs, and several of

those proposed programs have already been approved, including

MR. BUSCEMI:

7

Well, a state, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

is free to decide that it will not regulate surface mining
at all, but in that event the Federal Government will regulate
surface mining.
QUESTION:

8

Under the Commerce Clause?

MR. BUSCEMI:

9
10

But a state is not free to decide that

correct.

Under the Commerce Clause.

That's

And my only point, at this stage, is that the Tenth

11

Amendment does not restrict the congressional decision to do

12

that because, as this Court recognized in National League of

13

Cities, there is nothing in the Tenth Amendment that prohi­

14

bits regulation of individual entrepreneurs in private busi­

15

ness.

That distinction was expressly preserved.
I think that I would like to reserve the balance of

my time for rebuttal at this point, and I think I will ad­
dress the taking questions in connection with the Indiana
case, since they are exactly the same.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MARSHALL COLEMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES IN NO. 79-1538 g
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS IN NO. 79-1596
MR. COLEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
21

1

the Court:
In this case we are really talking about the idea of

2
3

a state.

4

local to be reached by the Congress through the exercise of

5

its authority under the Commerce Clause.

6

It's not even a case that involves whether the Congress can

7

do things that affect state functions, because that is also

8

settled.

9

This is not a question of whether something is too

That is settled.

Environmental laws have some impact on that.
Here we're talking, on the other hand, about a

10

wholesale displacement of integral state functions, because

11

the Act in question results in the abridgment of state power

12

to shape its communities and to shape its future.

13

QUESTION:

Is this, then, a matter of the extent

14

of the commerce power, or is it a matter of an impediment,

15

in this case a constitutional impediment, erected by the Nintl

16

and Tenth Amendments, perhaps, to the exercise by Congress

17

of the commerce power?

18

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, you know, the district court

19

found that it was not the first, that the commerce power was

20

sufficient.

21

merce power this far would stretch it to the breaking point,

22

and I am sympathetic with counsel --

23

I would urge to the Court that

QUESTION:

taking the com­

As I understand the National League of

24

Cities, which is a case cited a good deal by both sides, at

25

least in their briefs and relied on considerably by you, as I
22

1

understand that case, it didn't go to the scope of the

2

commerce power —

3

MR. COLEMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

6

That's right.

But rather to an impediment to the exer­

cise of the commerce power.
MR. COLEMAN:

That's right.

And that's what I want

7

to focus on, because that was the holding of the court, and

8

it's the --

9

QUESTION:

In this case.

10

MR. COLEMAN:

11

QUESTION:

-- in this case.

I think that --

I mean, in other words, nobody could

12

quarrel with the scope of the commerce power. If Congress

13

passed a law regulating newspapers, that -- some of them go

14

to two or three or more states,

15

afoul of the First Amendment.

16

MR. COLEMAN:

but it might run directly

Well, that's right, and I'm not going

17

to concede that the commerce power can be stretched this far.

18

But even if it were found that it could --

19

QUESTION:

As the Court of Appeals did find.

20

MR. COLEMAN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. COLEMAN:

As the court has said --

The district court.
-- it still collides with the idea of

23

federalism, which is the essence of American democracy.

24

idea that the people speak not just through the Congress but

25

that they speak through the Constitution, which means that
23

The

1

there is a role that exists, that's real, that's tangible,

2

that's reserved to the states and cannot be abridged.
The flaw in this case is not that it touches land

use, because this Court has held that Congress can provide

5

who must be served in restaurants,

6

grown on property, who it can be sold to.

7

of the Congress erodes the whole power of self-determination

8

because it prohibits to a community from saying what goes

how

’ can

be

But this decision

No one will contest but that the state is free to

10

say where its capital will be located, where its county seat

11

is to be located, and until this hour, it has not been

12

seriously contested that the question of community planning

13

to determine the layout of the community, its shape, its face,

14

its map, is integral to the authority and the integrity of

15

a system of state responsibilities in a constitutional frame­

16

work .

17

QUESTION:

Of course at the time the Constitution

18

was adopted, I suppose there would have been a considerable

19

doubt about the power of a state to regulate or determine that.

20

MR. COLEMAN:

That may be true; in the last 80

21

years, I suppose, it's become a traditional function of state

22

government, recognized time and time again by this Court as

23

recently as last term that the state does have considerable

24

authority in community planning.

25

it was the state, after all, that mapped out the roads and
24

And even in earlier times

1

streets and the confines

2

QUESTION:

There were no zoning laws.

3

MR. COLEMAN:

There were no zoning laws.

I think

4

the first zoning law was a 20th century development.

5

it's not the question of the period of time, how long it's

6

been in effect, whether it's a traditional function or not,

7

it's how important it is, and how much of it is deepseated

8

in the way states operate today.
QUESTION:

9

But

Well, are you saying that whatever may

10

have been the rights at that time, they were not granted to

1 1

the federal government?

12

MR. COLEMAN:.

13

They were not.

And there has beenr

no change since that'time.
QUESTION:

14

I think that's a different argument.

15

A minute ago you said there was plenty of power in the

16

federal government, but there's an independent curtailment

17

of the exercise of that power.

18

MR. COLEMAN:

Right.

19

QUESTION: If there weren't this independent doctrine

20

that you

could identify for us, there would be ample federal

21

power, you don't concede,, under the district court's reasoning --

22

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, I don't concede that --

23

QUESTION:

Arguendo, you say?

24

QUESTION:

Arguendo.

25

MR. COLEMAN:

Arguendo, and I think that -25

1

I understood the Chief Justice to talk about whether or not

2

this power had been given rise to by the states, or exercised

3

by the states themselves.

4

thoroughgoing a manner as it is now, but I think there was al­

5

ways the idea of community planning.

6

told us in these two 1869 cases that a state is really de­

7

fined as territory, people, and government, and that the over­

8

riding idea is the idea of a community.

9

And It probably wasn't in as

After all, Justice Chase

And what we're arguing here is not some doctrinaire

10

view of localism but the idea of self-determination, that

1 1

this is really a promoter of democracy.

12

QUESTION:

Well, wasn't the theory at any rate of

13

people who framed the

Constitution the idea that the powers

14

of government resided in the states to innovate as they would

15

or would not and they delegated certain powers to Congress?

16

MR. COLEMAN:

17

QUESTION:

That was; yes.

The Federal Government, although perhaps

18

somewhat fictionally in the last 30 or 40 years, has been

19

referred to as a government of limited powers.

20

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, that's one of the happy bypro­

21

ducts of the Tenth Amendment and the entire structure that

22

one state, as Justice Brandeis says, is free to experiment

23

and not put the whole nation in peril, that legislation that

24

is novel can be tried in one state.

25

it can be adopted other places, but it doesn't run the risk

to the question put to counsel before I arose, Chief Justice

12

Marshall has told us that this Court is not bound by Con­

13

gressional findings, if those findings in fact are a pretext

14

for taking on authority that it doesn't have.
The character of a community really is founded in

This is really, if I might say, and I hope it will be,

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, may I just ask, to
27

1

be sure I understand your contention, supposing Congress ex­

2

pressly found that the failure to restore the slope to the

3

original contour would result in numerous floods of interstate

4

waterways.

5

doctrine you describe would prevent Congress from enacting

6

the statute based on such a finding?

7

8

It has the power to do that.

MR. COLEMAN:

Would you say the

ings of Congress are not conclusive.

No, but assume that there was adequate

support for such a finding.

MR. COLEMAN:

I'm just trying to get the legal

believe that the law should be In that case that if the means

14

for effectuating the end of an abating clause is so intrusive

15

of state powers, that the Usery opinion would come into effect

16

and would prohibit the means. In effect, it would be a kind

17

of balance.

18
19

QUESTION:

In other words, this law would still be

unconstitutional?

20

MR. COLEMAN:

21

QUESTION:

That's right.

Because you say that requiring the

22

restoration of the slopes is intrusive of some inherent state

23

power?

24

25

MR. COLEMAN:

It's intrusive, and of course, as

the Court knows, the district court found as a matter of law
28

1

that these slopes did not themselves cause floods.

In south­

2

west Virginia, Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Court,

3

in Buchanan and Dickenson and Russell and Lee and Scott and

4

Tazewell and Wise Counties, so much land is so steep-sloped

5

that if this Act is upheld, those communities in the State of

6

Virginia are going to lose control of their destiny.

7

I think that this case draws into question our whole system

8

of local governance.

And

9

Land use planning is an integral part of statehood,

10

just as fire protection, police protection, sanitation, parks

11

and recreation.

12
13

QUESTION:

And the enforcement of local criminal

law.

14

MR. COLEMAN:

15

QUESTION:

And taxation.

And yet, how do you reconcile a case

like Perez v. the United States?

that too?

It's clear, Mr. Chief Justice, and the.

QUESTION:

No, I'm serious in my question.

It seems

to me that that case runs exactly against everything you've
29

1

been arguing to us.
MR. COLEMAN:

2

Well,

'.1

think

it

does

too;

3

and I've been before the Court on previous occasions to urge

4

that much of our criminal law is being usurped by the writ

5

of the habeas corpus, but you've told me about that and I

6

won't raise it again.

But I think it's a serious question.

7

I just believe that it is appropriate to urge be­

8

fore the Court today that the Congress can't zone the whole

9

character of a community.

Now, it's clear that while there ar e

10

other significant issues in this case, the diminution of value

11

to the property as the result of the original approximate

12

contour requirement is a serious question of constitutional

13

dimensions, because investment-backed expectations have been

14

from time out of mind that decisions about land use, certainly

15

in the 20th century, if they're made by anybody except the

16

people themselves, will be made by the state and not by

17

the Federal Government.
QUESTION:

18

One other question, Mr. Attorney

19

General.

The Virginia steep slope provision, unlike the

20

Indiana case, where there's a farmland, has a variance

21

authorization for the Secretary of the Interior.

22

the statute were administered,

23

resulted in variances in this part of the country where steep

24

slopes are so common, would it still have the same impact,

25

or are we perhaps getting to this question before we have to,

If in fact

in a way that frequently

until we know how often the -- ?

2

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, I think -- I can say this about

3

it, that it has no benefit to Virginia, first of all, fac­

4

tually, because the high wall must still be filled back in;

5

there still must be backfilling.

6

benefit to us at

7

8

cause we can't fill it back and make it stay.

So a variance is of no

These slopes

10

back in at an angle like this, the sedimentation just -- it

1 1

won't hold; it won't bind to the rock, and it will drift

12

away, and it makes it impossible, as the district court has

13

found, to do that.

14

tered in a manner not to intrude upon the Tenth Amendment and

15

the authority of the states to be masters of their own des­

16

17

still be so intrusive to say to Virginia, you could only have

18

coal mined and the land taken care of at all if you do it ac­

19

cording to the federal law.
QUESTION:

20

But the question of if it were adminis­

I would think it would

I must have misunderstood.

You're saying

21

that there is no authority for -- a variance would not relieve

22

the miner of the obligation to restore to the original con­

23

tour?

24

25

MR. COLEMAN:

That's right.

The original approxi­

mate contour permits of a variation, on the face of the
31

1

statute, but another provision requires that the high wall

2

must still be backfilled in.

3

on page 36-A of the Appendix, "For all practical purposes the

4

backfilling stipulation destroys the usefulness of the var­

5

iance, since the high wall must still be covered."

6
7

8
9

QUESTION:

And so, as the court has said

I don't understand those terms and I

can't visualize that.
MR. COLEMAN:

Contour mining is involved in these

counties in the following manner.

Someone goes into the side

10

of a mountain where you have these veins of coal that are

11

maybe two to three feet in depth and they outcrop all the way

12

up the mountain.

13

leaves a bench and a high wall.

14

the overburden, the material that's dug out --

They go in and cut their initial cut, which

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. COLEMAN:

And according to the Act,

High wall is a vertical wall?
It's like a cliff.

They'll just dig

17

straight into it till they come to a 90-degree angle.

18

overburden is then required, under the Act, to be put back

19

down in a valley and you go all the way around the mountain.

20

The way it works in southwest Virginia, you contour right

21

around the side of the

22

the court has found, any of this top of the mountain mining.

23

It's not practical down there.

24
25

mountain.

The

We don't really have, as

Then, after you get started, under the Act, you
take the overburden which is at the bottom of the valley and
32

1

put it back up on your bench, and then you backfill all the

2

way around, and the high wall under the Act has to be covered

3

up completely, even though the Act says there is a variance

4

under the original approximate contour,

5

the back wall up.
QUESTION:

6
7

if you have to fill

Well, the requirement of filling up the

high wall completely cancels out the variance?

8

MR. COLEMAN:

9

QUESTION:

As a practical matter?

MR. COLEMAN:

10

That's right.

That's right.

Mr. Chief Justice,

11

as I have said before, the people, territory, and government

12

add up to a state, and the primary concept is a community.

13

There are certain functions that have been recognized by this

14

Court to be essential to the separate and independent exis­

15

tence of a state.

16

certain powers.

17

freedom to structure its integral operations of traditional

18

government functions, and this law clearly does not comport

19

with a federal system which is the essence of our

20

system of democracy.

Nothing permits the direct

abridgment of

The Act in question displaces the state's

Justice

Chase's

words are perhaps best on

22

this

point when he said that our republic is founded in a

23

Constitution which in all of its provisions looks to an inde­

24

structible union composed of indestructible states.

25

tions raised in this case are serious and of constitutional
33

The ques

1

moment because if those communities in the State of Virginia

2

cannot determine what the face and shape and map of those

3

communities are going to be, then we have no limits to the

4

commerce power anywhere in the Constitution, and to cabin ahd

5

to curb it someday in the future will be even more difficult.

6

This is the best case that the Court now has before it to

7

make plain what has been thought for along time, that there are

8

limits to the commerce power, that those limits are contained

9

in the Constitution itself, and that when the commerce power

10

is exercised in a way to undo the right of a state or locality

1 1!

to be master of its destiny, they are not constitutional.

12

The question of taking has been amply brought out

13

in the brief.

14

Court I know will give due deference to the findings of the

15

court in this case which finds that the land is of no benefit

16

to the landowners except that it can be surface-mined.

17

so steep and of so little value that this Act in effect con­

18

stitutes a violation of the Fifth Amendment.

The Court has found, and in this case the

QUESTION:

19

It is

Well, Mr. Attorney General, I take it,

20

I think I did read something in the brief or in the papers

21

somewhere that if the land could be flattened instead of

22

recontoured and restored, it might well be of considerable

23

value.

24

MR.

25

QUESTION:

COLEMAN:

That's correct.

Now, I suppose that even if you didn't
34

1

mine it and flattened it, it would be of considerable value?
MR. COLEMAN:

2

That's right.

And there's an anomaly

3

here, because if I own a mountain and decide to flatten it,

4

and built a school in the exact countours that the man who

5

owns the mountain next to me does, but first takes the coal

6

out, I can do it, I can put my school or shopping center

7

there, but he can't.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, I take it the Federal Government,

this law wouldn't forbid the next day after you've restored

10

all these contours and all these high -- and covered all the

1 1

high walls, if for some other reason you decided to flatten

12

the land?

13

MR. COLEMAN:

Not tomorrow, because the regulations

14

that have been promulgated say that the bond has to remain in

15

effect for five years.

16

QUESTION:

Five years.

17

MR. COLEMAN:

So you sit there and wait for five

18

years and then you can come back and remove the overburden

19

all over --

QUESTION:
the first place?

What happens if you didn't mine it in

You could just --

22

MR. COLEMAN:

QUESTION:

24
25

Exactly.

-- take the whole mountain away and

since -- and have it -MR. COLEMAN:

Dump it down the hill.
35

QUESTION:

2

And develop your land that way?

Rather

than taking the coal out first?
MR. COLEMAN:

3

That's correct, Your Honor.

But if

4

you take the coal out first you're prohibited for a period of

5

five years from putting that land to its

6

use, which is a flat land on which a school or a hospital or

7

a shopping center or an industrial development can be

8

constructed.
QUESTION:

9

only

economical

Well, what -- the only taking there can

10

possibly be, then, I suppose, is in the sense that it forbids

11

you from taking the coal?

12

flatten the land and build a school or a factory on it

13

without mining it.
MR. COLEMAN:

14

Because you could now go ahead and

It would be very expensive to do that

15

if you weren't going to get paid for getting the coal out

16

first.

17
18

QUESTION:

Oh, I know, but if you believe your alle­

gation that if you flatten the land it's of great value?

19

MR. COLEMAN:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. COLEMAN:

22

QUESTION:

Which you do say so.
That's right.

I suppose you wouldn't need to mine it

23

to have it be of value

24

MR. COLEMAN:

25

That's right.

if you flattened it?
But I think that

the

Court

recog­

nizes still that one of the important factors in taking is
36

1

the diminution of value.

2

is pretty large if you've got valuable coal in your mountain

3

and you can't take it out because you can't afford to put it

4

back -QUESTION:

5

Obviously the diminution of value

Well, I take it that you would say that

6

either under the Tenth Amendment or under the Fifth or both,

7

the Federal Government could not forbid --

8

MR. COLEMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

The strip mining of this land, just flat.

Just an outright ban on strip mining?
MR. COLEMAN:

11

12

That's right.

I agree with you.

I would guess that it could.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI, ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT IN NO. 79-1538 8 ON BEHALF

18

OF THE APPELLEES IN NO. 79-1596 -- REBUTTAL

19

MR. BUSCEMI:

Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to say

20

just a couple of things in connection with this Tenth Amend­

21

ment Commerce Clause argument.

22

First of all, this is not a zoning statute in the

23

way that expression is ordinarily used.

24

attempt by the Federal Government to change the communities'

25

maps in the State of Virginia.
37

This is not an

1

QUESTION:

What about the prime farmland regulation?

2

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, that is in the next case,

3

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I will say that, again, there is

4

nothing in the prime farmland regulations that attempts to

5

tell a local community how to use its land or what areas are

6

to be used for residential purposes or commercial purpose or

7

anything.

8

over it's not a prohibition on surface mining.

9

statutory provision that says that if you're going to surface

All of this goes only to surface mining.

And more­

It's just a

10

mine, you've got to do it in this way, and you've got to

11

restore the land so you don't cause damage.

12

QUESTION:

Yes, but it does say that if a state

13

wants to permit, or private owners want to strip mine and ther

14

use it for something besides farmland, the Federal Government

15

says you may not do that, at least without first making it

16

back into farmland.

17

MR. BUSCEMI:

That's correct, Mr. Justice White.

18

And the purpose of that is to preserve the productive capa­

19

city of the farmland.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

And is it, as the Attorney General sug­

gested, is there a five year hiatus?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, the bond, the full amount of the

23

bond, and if I understand Section 519 of the Act, is not re­

24

leased until after five years, but 60 percent of the bond is

25

released in a much shorter time, as soon as the approximate
38

1

original contour is restored.

I think Section 519 will make

2

that quite clear.

And moreover, I do want to respond to this

4

QUESTION:

What's the consequence?

5

MR. BUSCEMI:

Oh, well, the consequence is that

6

there's only a small amount of the bond is retained for that

7

full five-year period, and if the mine operator or the owner

8

of the land believes that the financial -QUESTION:

9
10
11

What may the owner do within the five

years?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Oh, within the five years the owner

12

may put the land back into a flattened state if necessary,

13

if he wishes to do so,

14

great as they are supposed to be on the basis of

22

Now, there's no --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. BUSCEMI:

7

What's benchland?
Oh, benchland is the horizontal por­

tion .

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BUSCEMI:

10

Once there is land that is

So why not just call it flat land?
The word bench is designed to indi­

cate that it's up above, it's on the mountainside.

1 1

QUESTION:

It's a plateau?

12

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, it's the horizontal portion of

13

the cut into the side of the mountain.

When the mountain

14

started out it was just one straight line and then they cut

15

out at the corner, as they go around the mountain.

16

flat part is called a bench.

And the

17

QUESTION:

I get you.

18

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Attorney General says that

19

that's just a piece of rock and you can't put anything on it,

20

it won't stand that.

21

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I think

22

that if you look at the. pictures, for example, here in the

23

committee reports, you will see that it has been done.

24

Pennsylvania and Ohio have both had statutes requiring this

25

similar kind of restoration and it is practical, and Congress
40

1

found that it was so.
QUESTION:

2

This argument, would you just respond to

3

this for me, because I'm still a little puzzled.

4

ment, as I understand it, is that the slopes are so steep

5

that if you pile the stuff back up against the wall there's

6

no room for a bench.
MR.

7

BUSCEMI:

His argu­

Mr. Justice Stevens, I think that

8

that may well be his argument, but I think that Congress has

9

found that that is not so, and I think that many of these

10

benches are wide enough -QUESTION:

11

12

But didn't the district court findings

support what he says?
MR. BUSCEMI:

13

The district court also said that

14

compliance with the approximate original contour requirement

15

was physically impossible.

16

in the legislative record that it's not, because it's been

17

done.

But we know from the pictures

It seems to me -QUESTION:

18

It's been done in Ohio and Pennsylvania,

19

and presumably the mountains there are just as steep as they

20

are — ?

21

MR.

BUSCEMI:

Well, the State of West Virginia has

22

had no problem in complying with this statute.

24

has just been approved, and I think that the topographical

conditions there are very similar to what they are in

I don't think they are.

I don't think we're going to be able to

One last question.

Do you rely on the

8

variance as necessary to support this application of the

9

statute in Virginia?

10

MR. BUSCEMI:

I would say not, Mr. Justice Stevens,

11

but it is in the statute, and so we're telling you about it.

12

But I don't think it's absolutely necessary.
