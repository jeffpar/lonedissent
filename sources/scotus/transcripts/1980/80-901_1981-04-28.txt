ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

The Issue in this case is whether a federal mine in­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,

5

7

We'll hear arguments next

spector is required to obtain a search warrant before conducting

10

a routine safety and health Inspection of mine facilities such

11

as stone quarries pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health

12

Act of 1977.
The four courts of appeals that have addressed this

13
14
15

question have upheld the constitutionality of the Act.

However,

the district court in this case concluded that a warrant was
required to search appellee's quarry and therefore declared the

16

warrantless inspection provisions of the statute unconstitu­
17

tional.

The Government has taken a direct appeal from that

18

ruling.
19

The facts may be briefly stated.

The appellee,

20

Waukesha Lime and Stone Company, operates a limestone quarry and
21

mill facility in Wisconsin.

The quarry consists of two open

22

pits that are as deep as 30 feet in some places.

Generally,

23

about three times a day workers use explosives to dislodge
24

pieces of rock from the wall of the quarry.

The limestone is

then taken to a crushing facility where it is crushed and sorted

2

according to size, and the stone is then taken to a building

3

known as the dust house where it is dried, ground, and bagged

4

for direct sale to customers.

5

Waukesha's facility has been subject to regular safety

6

and health inspections by state officials for about 60 years

7

and it has been subject to federal safety and health inspection

8

since 1966 when Congress passed the predecessor of the Federal

9

Mine Safety and Health Act.

inspector showed up at Waukesha's mine to conduct a routine

Now, in April, 1978, a federal mine

health and safety inspection.

Following the inspection he cited

Waukesha for 25 violations of mandatory health and safety stan­
dards.

A few months later the same inspector showed up to con­

duct a followup inspection to determine whether Waukesha had
Corrected the most serious of these violations, specifically,
whether the airborne concentrations of silica dust in the dust

6

house had been lowered.

Inhalation of excessive amounts of

7

silica dust leads to a condition known as silicosis which is
8

a very serious respiratory disease, even more serious than black
9

lung disease.
20

Waukesha's president, appellee Douglas Dewey, refused
2

to allow the inspector to undertake the followup inspection
22

without a search warrant.

At that point the inspector discon­

23

tinued the inspection and issued a citation to the company for
24

denial of entry.

The citation was followed by a proposed civil

penalty of $1,000.

2

brought this action in the United States District Court for the

3

Eastern District of Wisconsin, to enjoin appellees from refusing

4

to permit warrantless inspections of their quarry pursuant to

5

the Mine Safety Act.

6

court denied that injunction and instead held in reliance on

7

this Court's decision in Marshall v.

8

warrantless inspection provisions violate the Fourth Amendment.

And as I noted a moment ago, the district

QUESTION:

10

In addition, the Secretary thereafter

Mr.

Barlow's that the Act's

Geller, you're doubtless familiar with

the Steagald case that this Court decided a couple of weeks ago,
where it said that law enforcement officers, even though they
possess an arrest warrant, could not go into the house of a
third person to seize thie person for whom they had the warrant.
Now, certainly crime has been a heavily regulated business in th e

14

last 50 or 60 years just like mining.

If one were to apply

15

Steagald

to

this

type

of

case, don't you think the district

16

court's opinion probably has something to be said for it?
17

MR. GELLER:

I think if Steagald were applicable to

18

this sort of case, the district court's opinion would have a lot
19

to be said for it, but we don't read Steagald as wiping out the
20

exception to the warrant requirement exemplified by cases such
21

as Biswell,

for pervasively regulated businesses.

22

QUESTION:

What about a pervasively regulated business

23

like organized crime?
24

MR. GELLER:

Well, Congress has not attempted to pass

25
Nmrth American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING.. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

5

1

that sort of a statute.

2

quite similar to the statute that this Court upheld in Biswell,

3

and I don't recall that there was anything in the Steagald

4

opinion which cast any doubt on the continuing validity of

5

Biswell, and therefore we continue to rely on Biswell.

6

is a regulatory search, for purposes of finding whether there

7

are health and safety violations and not for purposes of finding

8

evidence of a crime.
QUESTION:

It's passed a statute which we think is

MR. GELLER:

Well, I think -- there are two key cases

that -- of course, we rely on Colonnade and Biswell, and there's
a tendency which we have fallen into as much as the other party
does,to lump the two exceptions together in sort of a Colonnade-

16

Biswell exception.

I

think analytically thebe are really two sepa­

17

rate exceptions .

Colonnade, I think de’alt with’a situation in'‘which

18

there had been an extremely long history of pervasive government

regulation in an area -20

QUESTION:

That was of .alcoholic beverages?

21

MR. GELLER:

Alcoholic beverages.

In fact, it pre­

22

dated the Constitution, government regulation.

And the Court

23

found in that situation that Congress could reasonably authorize
24

warrantless inspections to carry out the purposes of the statute
25

1

Without any further inquiry having to be made as to the need for

2

warrantless searches it's interesting to read the Court's opin­

3

ion.

4

later in the Biswell case, the Court confronted a situation in

5

which there hadn't been that long history --

There's no discussion of that.

MR. GELLER:

There was a history, and it was pervasive.
There was a history, there was current

12

pervasive regulation, and the Court then went on to say that
13

when you have that sort of a situation, the Court will determine
14

reasonableness by looking at the enforcement needs and privacy

guarantees of the statute.
16

QUESTION:

Well, what's that kind of a situation?

17

There was a history, wasn't there?
18

MR. GELLER:

There was a history, as there is --

19

QUESTION:

And, in other words, do you think Congress

20

could enact legislation today, pervasively regulating a certain
21

22

element of industry and providing for inspections and searches
and seizures without a warrant?

And if it could not, would that

23

provision become constitutional ten years from now?

No, I don't think, I think that I have to

Congress can, consistent with its other constitutional powers,

move into an area for the purposes of regulation, and if --

4

QUESTION:

And if the regulation is pervasive enough,

5

it can provide for warrantless searches and seizures without

6

violating the Constitution, is that it?
MR. GELLER:

7

If the enforcement needs of the statute

8

require warrantless searches and if there are privacy guarantees

9

in the statute that take the place of a warrant, as there was

in Biswell and as we contend that there is in this case -although in this case we also are dealing with an industry
which -QUESTION:

Of course, my brother Rehnquist would sug­

gest that the police would always say that their enforcement
needs require them to violate the Fourth Amendment.
MR. GELLER:

Well, we're not talking here, first of

16

all, about any criminal enforcement.

We're talking about healtl

17

and safety inspections, for which this Court has said, routine
18

warrantless inspections are frequently necessary in order to
19

carry out the purposes of the statute.

That's certainly not

20

the case with criminal law enforcement.

And the situations, in

21

fact, in which it is necessary to conduct warrantless searches
22

in order to enforce the criminal laws, the Court has recognized
23

exceptions, such as exigent circumstances,

even

24

tional criminal law enforcement areas.

the Court were to view this case as not involving a long his­

Court in Biswell.

So, in other words, your answer to my

hypothetical case of Congress enacting a statute pervasively
regulating an industry and providing for the warrantless sear­
ches and seizures of elements in that industry without securing
a warrant, if there was a showing that there was a need to

15
do so -16
MR. GELLER:

If there was an urgent federal interest.

17
QUESTION: There would be no constitutional violation.
18
Right, today, the day the statute's enacted.
19
MR. GELLER:

Yes, yes.

That's right.

We don't think

20
it can be the case that if this case had arisen 30 years from
21

now it might be different.

Well, then, Kahriger was rightly decided

MR. GELLER:

I'm not familiar with that line of cases,

Justice Rehnquist, or its relevance to -QUESTION:

those cases.
QUESTION:

Supposing the Government for 100 years has

8

pervasively regulated gambling?

9

MR. GELLER:

10

11
12
13
14

QUESTION:

Well -Does that make any sort of warrantless

inspection of a nightclub that might be thought to be carrying
on gambling -- ?
MR. GELLER:

No, I think -- let me say, first of all,

we think that the length of regulation and the pervasiveness
of regulation are relevant to what are the reasonable expecta­

15

tions of privacy that a person in that industry may have.

If

16

there's been a long history of regulation for 200 years, as
17

there was in Colonnade, then there really can't be any expecta­
18

tion of freedom from government inspection.

I think for that

19

reason in Colonnade the Court didn't go any further than
20

saying that, didn't engage in any analysis as to the need for
21

warrantless -- .
22

QUESTION:

Let me try another hypothetical on you.

23

Suppose, passing over the problems of whether building con­
24

struction is in the area of interstate commerce, for the moment,
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

10

1

that on all buildings and I suppose all commercial buildings

2

would clearly be covered, random inspections by federal inspec­

3

tors during the process of construction until the building was

4

completed.

Would you think that's constitutional?
MR. GELLER:

5

There would be nothing unconstitutional

6

on the face of such a scheme.

7

the urgent federal interest is, and I said, you have to inquire

8

as to the need for warrantless inspections.

9

a need for warrantless inspections and when there isn't a need

10

13
14

There's not always

then the traditional warrant requirement should certainly apply.
QUESTION:

11
12

You'd have to inquire into what

There is such a statute with respect to

constructing bridges, I think, across any navigable stream,
that federal inspectors may come on the site and inspect it at
any time without a warrant.

I suppose it's to see whether the

Steel and concrete is going to be enough to hold the bridge up,
15

so it won't fall on the boats or drop the people.
16

MR. GELLER:

I think in that sort of a situation

17

there's a minimal expectation of privacy and it's certainly
18

reasonable for those sorts of inspections to take place.
19

I learned of another example of a very recent industry in which
20

there hasn't been a long history of regulation and yet there's
21

pervasive government regulation and no one has challenged the
22

fact that it's constitutional.

That's the nuclear power indus­

23

try, which has not been in existence for a very long period of
24

time.

You don't have the long history that you even had in

North American Reporting

Biswell.

2

QUESTION:

Of course, your expectation of privacy,

3

that's kind of a circular argument.

4

statute pervasively regulating an industry and you're an element

5

in that industry and if that legislation provides for the

6

warrantless inspections of elements of that industry, then if

7

the statute's valid, you've lost your expectation of privacy.

MR. GELLER

QUESTION:

10

13

MR. GELLER

16

But that doesn't mean you have no standing

Not at all.

But that's just one element,

MR. GELLER

Well, the appellees -It was in the gun case.
Well, there was a licensed gun dealer in

that case.

There is no physical reason --

QUESTION:

You could either agree to a search in

advance or you don't get a license?
22

MR. GELLER

Well, I think the same argument could be

23

made in the mining industry, Justice White.

There's no piece

24

of paper that is labelled a license, but we don't think that

MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

11

13
14

So all non-coal mines you're talking about,

not just stones?

10

12

We're talking about the non-coal portion

of the mining industry.

8
9

By the way, are we talking here about the

stone quarry business or all mines?

6
7

To begin with, every mine that's

This case involves stone.
Not just the ones that perhaps would be

where your enforcement needs to be very great because the danger
to health Is very great.

There are some mines that qualify

as mines that aren't all that dangerous.
MR. GELLER:

Well, there may be some cases at the

15

fringe.

This case involves a stone quarry.

The courts of

16

appeals cases that have arisen under this statute involve
17

stone quarries and gravel pits.

That's the sort of situation

18

that this Act was addressed to, where there was a need for fur­
19

ther regulation, the non-coal portion of the mining industry.
20

QUESTION:

What about the coal?

Warrants in the

21

inspection of coal mines?
22

MR. GELLER:

No, no.

There aren't.

We had a combination of cases four years

24

ago on that subject, didn't we?

MR. GELLER:

Yes, there are no warrants either under -■

2

this Act involves the coal portion of the mining industry as

3

well, but neither these appellees nor any other plaintiff has

4

chosen to attack that section of the statute,

5

the theory that that portion of the industry has been subject to

6

pervasive government regulation even though --

7

QUESTION:

presumably on

I suppose there's a greater privacy inter­

8

est in a coal mine than there is in a big open pit, isn't there?

9

A little harder to see inside it?

10
11
12
13
14
15

MR. GELLER:

Well, I think one of the things that I

think is, I should say, is that the distinction between coal and
non-coal portions of the industry is not coterminous with the
distinction between underground

and surface mines.

Fifteen

percent of the miners in the limestone and quarry industry are
underground, and 35 percent of the miners in the coal industry
work in surface mines.

So there isn't the same --

16

QUESTION:

But there has historically been pervasive

17

regulation of the coal mining industry.
18

MR. GELLER:

Yes.

19

QUESTION:

And at least in this case there's no attack

20

upon warrantless searches provided by the statute of coal mines.
21

MR. GELLER:

There is not.

That's correct, although

22

the Federal Government only got into the business of regulating
23

the non-coal portions of the industry in 1966.

But the states

24

had been regulating non-coal portions of the industry for many,
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

14

1

many decades.

3

QUESTION:

Particularly this state of this particu­

lar entity.

MR. GELLER:

Wisconsin had been regulating this quarry

5

since 1922, but other states had gone back even further than

6

that.

involved protects the privacy of the individual, and whether

there's a need for warrantless searches. That is, we think, what

So we think that the test is whether there's an urgent

Biswell says and we think this case falls under Biswell.
I don't think I have to spend very much time trying
to convince the Court of the urgent federal interest involved
in frequent safety and health inspections of mine facilities.
What I would like to spend my remaining time on is -QUESTION:

The federal interest is precisely the same

5

as in OSHA, isn't it?
6

MR. GELLER:

Excuse me?

7

QUESTION:

It's precisely the same federal interest

8

as was present in the OSHA case?
9

MR. GELLER:

Well, except that we're dealing here with

20

an industry that Congress found to be among the most hazardous
2

in the nation.

It deals with a specific industry with an

22

acknowledged history of safety and health violations.

The most

23

dangerous -24

QUESTION:

In OSHA they found a history of all sorts

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

15

1

2

of dangerous things that justified the same program.
MR. GELLER:

Well, as to certain portions of the

3

industries that OSHA covered, but OSHA also covered a lot of

4

industries that weren't all that dangerous --

5

QUESTION:

What you’re saying is, there's a constitu­

6

tional distinction between something that's very dangerous and

7

something that's just pretty dangerous?

8

9
10
11
12
13
14
15

MR. GELLER:

Well, I think one of the tests that

Biswell sets up is whether there's an urgent federal interest
for the warrantless searches.
QUESTION:

Well, would you say that there's an urgent

federal interest in the apprehension of felons?
MR. GELLER:

Yes.

But I wouldn't think it could meet

the other parts of the Biswell test, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
Now, I think it's important, in trying to focus on
why there isn't the need for a warrant in this case, to look at

16

what the statutory protections are for mine operators

in order

17

to determine what further protection a warrant would provide.
18

Now, I think the best way to demonstrate that a warrant would
19

be of virtually no practical value in the mine safety context,
20

and would add virtually no protection to these minimal privacy
21

interests that we think mine operators have in these open pits,
22

is to contrast mine inspections with the sorts of inspections
23

that were involved in the Camara and See cases , where the Court
24

held that a warrant was required for routine housing inspections
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

16

1

and in Barlow’s, which involved health inspections under the

2

Occupational Safety and Health Act.

3

The Court stated in Camara and it repeated in Barlow’s

4

that a warrant would serve a valuable purpose in those situa­

5

tions because it would limit the unbridled discretion of the

6

inspector as to when and whom to search.

7

addition, that a warrant would assure the homeowner or the

8

businessman that the inspection was authorized by statute, and

9

was conducted pursuant to an administrative plan containing

10
11

specific neutral criteria, and that it would advise the owner
of the precise scope and objects of the search.
Now, these points make a great deal of sense, espe­

12
13

cially Camara, but also in the Barlow's situation, Camara -QUESTION:

14
15

The Court stated, in

Well, the Government didn't think so in

Barlow.
MR. GELLER:

I think that the Court found that there

16

was not the factual basis that the Government thought there was
17

for a need for warrantless inspections in the Barlow's situation
18

But I think we concede freely that Barlow's involved a situation
19

where six million businesses were subject to the Occupational
20

Safety and Health Act, but only about 80,000 businesses were
21

searched every year.

Therefore, when an OSHA inspector showed

22

Every mine subject

The statute that regulates this industry sets forth a

minimum number of inspections that have to take place every
single year.

It's a minimum of two for surface mines and four

for underground mines.

It's generally the same inspector who

shows up periodically every few months to conduct the inspec­
tion.
The inspector in this case submitted an affidavit

15

saying that he had been making all of the inspections of stone
16

quarries in Waukesha County over the previous five years.

He

17

had been showing up at this limestone quarry repeatedly to make
18

these inspections.

forth the neutral criteria that would allow the search to take

place.

5

provide in that situation?

The statute itself sets

One has to ask what additional value a warrant would

Now, the point of all this, I think, is that a warrant

6
7

here, just as in Biswell -- and in Biswell, I might add, the

8

Court made the same analysis.

9

that someone who engaged in a licensed business of dealing in

10

11
12
13
14

The Court pointed out in Biswell

firearms is given a copy of all the regulations that are appli­
cable to his business and is told in advance of what the limits
of the searching officer's powers are.

And the Court said, we

don't think that the additional benefits that a warrant would
provide in that situation are very meaningful or outweigh the
need for frequent, unannounced inspections, which the Court

15

found in the Biswell situation and we assert in this case, Con­
16

gress found were essential to accomplishing of the statutory
17

purpose.
18

And the point of all this is that a warrant here,
19

just as in Biswell, would tell the mine operator absolutely
20
nothing that he doesn't already know.

And because the Act con­

21

tains legislative standards that would certainly satisfy the
22

administrative probable cause standard of Camara and Barlow's,
23

we think that mine inspectors could procure a warrant prior to the se
24

frequent routine inspections virtually for the asking.
25
North American Reporting

19

Moreover, mine inspectors don’t have the unbridled

1
2

discretion under the Act, but are carefully limited by statute

3

as to who, when, and how often they are to search.

4

fore difficult to see how even the minimal privacy interests

5

that a mine operator might have in these pits would be benefited

6

in any meaningful way by requiring resort to the warrant process

7

A warrant would simply become an empty gesture, we think, under

8

these circumstances.
Now, even though a warrantless context serves no use­

9
10

11

ful purpose, I suppose there would be no great lasting harm in
insisting on a warrant if the mine safety and health enforcement
program would not be adversely affected.

12

It's there­

But Congress reason-

f

ably concluded that a warrant requirement would seriously under­
13

cut the Act's enforcement objectives because of the "notorious
14

ease" -- and that's the phrase taken from the Senate report -15

the notorious ease with which many mine hazards may be concealed

or corrected temporarily if an inspector has given advance warn­

sort of a situation would meet the test of Biswell.
QUESTION:

13

We don't think it would get around the war­

I thought you were arguing now about the

congressional finding of urgency and necessity to -MR. GELLER:

I am, but I think that's just one portion

14

of the Biswell test, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and we think that
15

for a statute to meet the Biswell test it has to satisfy all of
16

these criteria, not just one.
17

Now, we mentioned one of these particularly egregious
18

examples in which unannounced Inspections would have perhaps
19

saved some lives, in our brief.

That's the Scotia mine disaster

20

which took the lives of 23 miners and three mine inspectors in
21

1976.

There the evidence showed after the fact that the mine

22

operator had been moving certain brattices which controlled the
23

amount of ventilation in the mine after the inspector had left,
24

but had made it appear through some sort of cosmetic changes
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

21

1

that there had been adequate ventilation.

2

very case -- this is a very useful example -- what the inspector

3

was going back in to see was whether this quarry had controlled

4

the level of silica dust in the dust house.

5

that if advance notice had been given, such as by showing up

6

and being refused entry until he went back and got a warrant,

7

a quarry could well take cosmetic changes such as shutting down

8

the machines for awhile or opening up the windows for awhile to

9

make it seem as if the dust levels were lower than they really

10

13
14

Now, it seems clear

are.
Of course, mine inspectors could try to solve this

11

12

And in fact, in this

problem by getting a warrant before showing up in the first
place, but I think that would produce a massive administrative
burden.

You have 1,900 mine inspectors who have to make, by

Statute

are mandated to make a minimum number of inspections

15

every year.

Last year they made more than 120,000 inspections

16

of mine facilities.
17

I see my white light, and I'd like to reserve the
18

balance of my time, if I may.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS R. CROAK, ESQ.,
21

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
22

QUESTION:

Let me put to you at the outset a question

23

I put to your friend.

What about the hypothetical:

Congress

24

after identifying building construction as being within the
25
North American Heporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

22

1

reach of federal legislative power, laying that aside, then

2

decided that they were going to have inspectors who could come

3

on the on-site of any building more than 100 feet high at any

4

time during the course of construction to inspect. Let's make it

5

100 so they don't come into one-story houses.
MR. CROAK:

6
7

there's any history of pervasive regulation.
QUESTION:

8
9

14

I don't think --

Well, there is a pervasive degree of regula­

MR. CROAK:

Yes, but I don't think that -- at least

so far -QUESTION:

13

tion at the local level.

10

11

No, I don't think so.

Is that all right?

And it is random, it is random inspection

by building inspectors.

I don't know that 100 feet is the limit

but tall buildings always have random inspections during con­
struction.

Now that's pervasive throughout the country, munici­

15

pal, sometimes the state.
16

MR. CROAK:

Well, I think Camara and See answered

17

that question, though.

Those were building, one was a building

18

inspection, one was a fire inspection, and the requirement there
19

was for warrants.

So I think your question really is Justice

20

Stewart's question, can you select an industry and having
21

selected an industry avoid the normal Fourth Amendment require­
22

ments of a warrant?
23

QUESTION:

But under your argument, it wouldn't be

24

valid the day the legislation was enacted but it might be valid

By then you'd have 25 years of history.

I think in this issue of pervasive regulation, there
are some considerations.

If you analyze the industries that

this Court has found to be pervasively regulated, they cover a
broad spectrum of activities within the industry.

The liquor

concerns are taxed going back to the Revolution, but after
Prohibition we enacted 27 U.S. Code, which tells the distiller

15

or the brewer what size, or he has to have a permit to have a
16

brewery or distillery, he has to -- the size bottles that he
17

puts in, the makeup of what he sells, is regulated; who he sells
18

to Is regulated.

There's even some regulation In there about

19

his pricing arrangements.

And --

20

QUESTION:

Well, the history of local inspection of

21

buildings is at least 100 years old, is it not?
22

MR. CROAK:

Yes.

23

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that pervasive?

24

MR. CROAK:

I don't think so.

I think you want me to

25
North American Reporting

1

say that you can build a multistatute pyramid which will reach

2

pervasive regulation, some of it being local regulation, some

3

of it being federal, some --

4

QUESTION:

Well but the history of this country is

5

that a great deal of regulation that once was considered entire­

6

ly Ideal has, as you well know, in the lhst 40 -years become

7

pretty much federalized; maybe even more than 40.
MR. CROAK:

I don't dispute that and I don't imagine

we're here today -QUESTION:

10

I'm not arguing in favor of it.

MR. CROAK:

QUESTION:

No.
I'm just observing the history of the fact.

12

MR. CROAK:

13

I think we'd all agree it's a fact and

we won t discuss our own particular views on the wisdom, but the
14

fact is that if this approach is used, I suppose one could
15

fashion an argument that every business in America today is
16

pervasively regulated.
17

QUESTION:

Your argument is that the history of per-

18

vasive regulation has to be regulation by the jurisdiction that
19

is now asserting the right to search and seize without a war20

MR. CROAK:

That's right.

In order to come under the Biswell --

The other factors which are important are the statute itself.

The

And if you look at

the history of this particular industry, I think you find that
there was really no meaningful federal regulation of this
quarry until, really, 1978, when the 1977 Act become effective,
because the Act of 1966 merely established certain advisory
standards.

It provided that there was really no citation au­

12
13

thority in the inspecting agents; it provided for one inspection
a year, and now we've gone to two -- I don't regard that change

14

as significant.

It also provided that in a very narrow area of

15

cases involving non-coal mines, inspectors could issue what
16

were known as withdrawal orders, which would have the effect of
17

a temporary shutdown.

The nature, if you read those orders,

18

it's hard to equate those with a limestone quarry, an open-pit
19

limestone quarry especially.

But what I'm trying to say is

20

that the language of the Court In Barlow's talks about a long
21

tradition of close governmental supervision.

And I suggest to

22

the Court that there's no way you can look at this particular
23

industry and say there's a long tradition of close governmental
24

supervision.
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

26

1

I'd also point out to the Court that I think what the

2

Government is trying to do is to piggyback the long tradition,

3

if you will, of government control of the coal mine by -- becaus e

4

what happened in 1977 was that Congress amended the Coal Act,

5

did away with the act that affected us, the act of '66, and in­

6
7

8
9

10

11

corporated by amendment and by definition everything that was
in the various mining industries and brought them all under the
same strictures that had controlled the coal industry.
And, I don't challenge the wisdom or the right of the
Congress to do that.

I'm only saying that that doesn't give the

Congress the right, however, to do away with the Fourth Amend­
ment expectations of this particular Industry.

12

The other concern which I have is the argument, or the
13

suggestion of an argument that solely because of the injury
14

rate, or the dangerousness, if you will, of a particular indus­
15

try, that this standing alone gives the Congress the right to
16

mandate warrantless entry.

Mow, I don't think any of us are

17

unsympathetic with the goals of government to cut down injuries,
18

but I think that there is no case that this Court has ever de­
19

cided which ever said that injury alone is a justification for
20

waiver of the Fourth Amendment.
21

22

If we go that route and start

establishing those criteria, I suggest we'll be

pldwing

ground,and perhaps, Justice Rehnquist, opening the door for

23

some of the things that you suggested by your questions.

There are certainly areas in American life where

everyone would agree -- the Congress, or us, or everyone --

would agree that there is a significant dangerousness to most of

us as citizens, whether we be workers involved or citizens

exposed to certain hazards.

QUESTION:

I just took another look at Camara, which

6

you seem to rely on, Mr. Croak, and that didn't involve the

7

building inspection while a tall building was in the process of

8

being constructed. That was an occupied ground-floor area.

tinction between a completed and an uncompleted building, no,

ings, recited the great incidence of the fires out in the gam­

MR. CROAK:

QUESTION:

Las Vegas.

And there have been three or

four of those.

And then went on to show the loss of life and

18

went on to show the failure to have adequate safety provisions
19

in those buildings, complying with requirements, and then cited
20

all of the cases -- and there are quite a few of them -- of
21

buildings collapsing during the process of construction, with
22

three, four, five, twenty people, workmen, getting’killed.

Do you say they could not legislate for random inspection of

buildings in process of construction if that hazard existed?

11

MR. CROAK:

That's correct. You can't even obtain

some of the materials necessary to generate nuclear power, for
example, without obtaining them through licensing.
QUESTION:

At one time there was a statutory prohibi­

tion against any private individuals even engaging in the
12

nuclear power industry, wasn't there, before 1954?
13

MR. CROAK:

I'm not familiar with that but it wouldn't

14

surprise me at all, and it doesn't offend me.

I think that

15

government can reserve activities solely to itself.

I think

16

that there is one other concern that I have and that is the
17

Government's argument that -- and this Is kind of an unusual
18

situation, the Government is telling us what's good for us, and
19

what's good for us is not to request a warrant because there
20

are other provisions within the law that will take care of us
21
22
23
24

and we are saying we don't want that, we want the Government to
get a warrant.

It's kind of a backwards situation, if you will,

but if I could discuss it?
The Government says that the injunctive procedures are

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

31

1

the equivalent of a warrant.

2

talking about administrative warrants or their equivalent.

3

I suggest that an injunctive procedure is not that.

4

examines the record in this case the pleadings of the Government

5

really allege that we didn't let them in.

6

shift the burden to, then?

7

General has advised the Court, that administrative action was

12

There was language in

Barlow's

If one

And so who did it

The record is clear, the Solicitor

commenced against us for not letting them in, and we were fined
$1,000.

I don't think that the injunctive procedure provision

was probably even necessary, because If in fact the government
inspector had a right to enter, I think that there was adequate
remedy in the law

as it exists now

for an injunctive procedure

of some sort to let him in, so that by putting it in the statute
13

I don't think that it gave us any rights, any more : or

less

14

than existed before.
15

But the more important thing is that the hearing that

one gets at this time is, whether you let us in or not.

And

17

the relief sought here was a permanent injunction against us

ever to keep government inspectors out.

QUESTION:

MR. CROAK:

The statute is a permanent search warrant.
But they're telling us that the equivalent

of the search warrant hearing is the hearing on injunctive

And -QUESTION:

10

11
12
13

Yes.

I also question the position that

the Government takes about the absence of a provision for
entry, when entry is denied.

I find nothing in the statute

that prohibits the agent from forcing his way in.

I understand

that it's the administrative policy of the Secretary of Labor
at the present time to direct people not to do that,

but

there's nothing that you can read that I can read in the statute
14

that prohibits that.
15

QUESTION:

Mr. Croak, just as a matter of information,

16

is there anything in this statute -- and perhaps I should know
17

from the papers, that talks about inspecting records.’ Or are we
18

only talking about inspection of physical premises?
19

MR. CROAK:

There is a record provision of the records

20

that are required to be kept and to be made available to the
21

Secretary.

Is that what you mean?

Do you think there was some other attack

in Biswell?
MR. CROAK:
QUESTION:
MR. CROAK:

May I answer this?
Yes.
Because the enforcement interest, I think,

affected the entire public in America.

Or at least in the

really affects the miners.

QUESTION:

Don't say that to me, because I might be

QUESTION.:.

To pursue one of Justice Marshall's earlier

7

questions on this duration of the tradition, of the pervasive­

8

ness, before we had elevators in buildings there wasn't any

9

need to have random inspection of elevators and elevator shafts,

10
11
12
13

and then elevators which made possible high-rise buildings,
because without elevators they couldn't have had them.
They had to begin somewhere, with random inspections of eleva­
tors, did they not?
MR. CROAK:

Yes, and I don't have as much trouble

14

with the initial inspection, because that hinges on the expec­
15

tation of privacy, which is one of the considerations here.

But

16

this mine has been operated at this location since the turn of
17

the century.

And I think that's different than the case --

18

QUESTION:

At the turn of the century they didn't know

19

much about black lung and brown lung, or if they did they
20

tolerated it.

Is that not so?

21

MR. CROAK:

Oh, I think that's- true.

But the history

22

of coal regulation and the attempts at coal regulation go back
23

to 1911, as I recall.

The effectiveness of some of it might be

24

questioned.

Obviously, the example the

Solicitor General gave

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

38

1

of the tragedy was a coal mine explosion.

2

government regulation of coal -- I don't think my case stands

3

or falls on the regulation of the coal mines.

4

that if my recollection is correct for several years, 34 years

5

ago, at the end of World War II, the Government ran the coal

6

industry in America.

7

QUESTION:

I think that

I also point out

Well, suppose, suppose this was a coal mine

8

case, and we decided that warrantless inspection is all right.

9

Would it, wouldn't you expect it to just rest on the strength

10

11

of the enforcement interest in the sense that hazard to the
miners, and the necessity of saving lives, and the effectiveness
of the search, is that -- that's sort of Biswell, isn't it?

12

MR. CROAK:

I don't think it's as much as Biswell and

13

I would, if I were defending the coal mine search -- although
14

I realize I'm on the other side here,

I would point to the

15

regulation in the national public interest in coal as a fuel
16

and the energy problems and I come back to what I said, I think
17

there was a '46 -18

QUESTION:

I know, you might help solve the

energy

19

problem by staying out of the hair of the miners, and let them
20

go without any inspections at all, but if you were going to
21

defend the warrantless inspection of coal mines, you would have
22

to get to the health hazards sooner or later.
23

MR. CROAK:
24

Oh, and I don't mean that health hazards

aren't a consideration, to take it -- there were considerations

in Barlow's.

QUESTION:

MR.

CROAK:

Yes.
And I'm only saying that if I were defend­

4

ing coal I'd also point out two years:of --involving the operatic n

5

of the coal mining industry in this country in the '40s as an

6

example of the pervasiveness of Government regulation.
QUESTION:

7

Before they began coal mine inspections,

8

it was near the turn of the century, there probably was a his­

9

tory of illness, disease, injury, explosions, and what not that

10

led to those enactments.
MR. CROAK:

11
12

13
14

Isn't that so?

Oh, yes.

And I don't dispute that the

enactments are motivated by a desire to cut injuries.
Barlow's, too, the concern was to cut injury.

That was

And my only

statement is that I don't think that standing alone that that's
a proper basis or criterion, or you will have completely, eroded

15
the Fourth Amendment.

And also, then, we get into a situation

16
that I don't think -17
QUESTION:

Isn't that always -- isn't the fulcrum of

18
the Fourth Amendment "reasonable," "unreasonable," or "reason­
19
able"?
20
MR. CROAK:

Yes.

21

QUESTION:

So what might have been unreasonable at

22

one time -- our cases

have- said

that -- determines reasonable

23
or the reverse of that proposition.
24
MR.

CROAK:

But really, I'm arguing that my case is

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

40

1

Barlow's, which is not that old, and there's been no change.

2

As a matter of fact, the change, if anything, is it's a little

3

safer now than it was three years ago, I think, although there

4

really isn't any significant change since then.

5

that that alone is not the basis, safety considerations alone

6

are not the basis to justify an erosion of the normal Fourth

7

Amendment rights of the operator in court.
QUESTION:

inspection?
MR. CROAK:
QUESTION:

12

14

You wouldn't think that would be enough

then to sustain the Coal mine inspection, warrantless coal mine

11

13

I'm saying

No, I don't think so, because -Do you think you have to add a long his­

tory of regulation?

But that just goes, that goes to expecta­

tions of privacy, doesn't it?
MR. CROAK:

Yes, it does.

And a long history of

15

regulation is only one factor, as I said before.

Licensing

16

is another thing.

Coal mines have to be licensed as opposed to

17

this registration of the kind of mine that we're operating.
18

I don't know whether that's a significant consideration, but
19

I think you weigh all of these things and the problem I get is
20

this piecemeal attacking of the industry concern, and -21

QUESTION:

Well, have the states -- have the states

22

inspected premises like these for quite a while or not?
23

MR. CROAK:

Yes.

In Wisconsin there is a warrant

24

procedure.

I would be candid, this operator has never insisted

North American Reporting

1

it be used, but it exists and our reference is in our brief to

2

the statute, that there is a provision.

3

alluded to the fact that this mine has been inspected since

4

1922.

5

inspection -- and I think the record bears me outinthis, was the

6

kind of inspection that you get under the Wisconsin worker's

7

compensation law, and I think the testimony showed that the same

8

people that were inspecting the department store, were inspect­

9

ing the factory, were involved in mine inspection, for many,

10

11
12
13

And the Government

I think, in all candor, though, I must say that that

many years because Wisconsin had a comprehensive worker's
compensation law that covered anybody that employed more than
two people.

But there is, as I say, under that law today there

exists a statutory provision for obtaining what is called an
inspection warrant.

Thank you.

MR. GELLER:

I'd like to just speak for a moment

20
to what I think is the key question in the case.

Certainly

21
it's the key question as posed by Biswell, but it's not somethin E
22
that I think the appellee has addressed.

And that is, if in

23
order to satisfy an urgent federal interest Congress determines
24
that warrantless searches are essential, and if the warrant

2

tions to the businessman in terms of either limiting discretion

3

of the searching officer or in giving the businessman informa­

4

tion as to why the officer is there, why is Congress's decision

5

to set up a provision such as that unreasonable under the Fourth

Amendment?

procedure under those circumstances, especially if it means

8

that the urgent federal interest can't be accomplished?

What is the benefit of insisting on a warrant

Now, the appellee has never identified what a warrant
would bring him in a case like this.
in his brief.

He's mentioned one thing

He says, if there had been a warrant, the

inspector couldn't have done what he did here, which is to show
up and walk around our premises for an hour without telling us
he was there.
But I think that a warrant wouldn't have done anything

5

about that.

He could have had a warrant and still walked

6

onto the premises and not identified himself for an hour.
7

By the way, I should add that the statute prohibits
8

showing up without identifying yourself to the mine operator,
9

who has a right to walk around with you.

So the statute pro­

20

vides that protection.

In fact, the Stoudt's Ferry case, which

2

is a case that was decided by the 3rd Circuit under the statute,
22

shows that a warrant was really not a meaningful protection, but
23

the injunction procedure under the statute may well be.
24

The mine operator in Stoudt's Ferry refused to let

the inspector in claiming that he had some trade secrets he

wanted to protect.

the district court molded the injunction to take account of

these trade secrets.

6

necessary, and showed up, it wouldn't have taken account of any

7

of these trade secrets.

But if the inspector had simply gotten

this Court would have decided that one is

By the way, Justice Stevens, I think that the statute
does prohibit forcible entries for the same reason I think the
statute in Colonnade did, because there's no specific provision
in there that allows it, and the Court interpreted the statute
involved in Colonnade as not allowing forcible entries unless
Congress specifically says so.

Here Congress has provided

alternative remedies when an inspector is refused entry.

One

is the civil penalty and another is the injunction proceedings.
15

And just finally, Justice Stewart, about the licens­
16

ing requirement, I think the situation is really no different
17

than it was under the Gun Control Act, even though there was a
18

license there.

When the Gun Control Act was passed people who

19

were in that business had to comply with the provisions of that
20

statute or go out of business.

The same way here:

the Secre­

21

tary or whatever can shut down mines that refuse to comply with
22

the provisions of the Mine Safety Act, including this provision
23

that they comply with health and safety standards and allow for
24

inspections.

People who don't want to' continue under those

circumstances are free to go out of business but I don't know

2

that it makes that much difference whether there's a physical

piece of paper labeled a license.

statute is, put in a
