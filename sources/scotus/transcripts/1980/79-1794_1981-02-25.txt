ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. BAUGHMAN:

7

8
9

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to take just a few moments to review

10

the facts in this case.

11

first state concisely the framework in which the State of

12

Michigan views this case.

13

But before I do I would like to

We view this as a warrants case involving an issue

14

as to the scope of the search allowed under a warrant which

15

is directed at premises involving an issue as to the authority

16

given to the executing officers by the warrant itself to

17

detain persons on or departing from the premises for a period

18

of time reasonable and necessary to insure the full and

19

faithful execution of that warrant.

20

Now, the facts are these.

One October tenth at

21

approximately 10:10 p.m. a team of Detroit police officers

22

arrived at a residence in the City of Detroit to execute a

23

search warrant for narcotics and narcotics paraphernalia.

24

The affidavit in support of that warrant indicated that a

25

purchase of heroin had been made inside that residence the
3

1

2

day previous from a black male known as George.
As the officers arrived to execute the warrant they

3

observed respondent, George Summers, come out of the house

4

and proceed down the front steps.

5

him if he lived in the house.

6

was shown a copy of the search warrant and asked if he could

7

get the officers inside the house.

8

left his keys inside but could ring someone over the intercom.

9

He did so and a person later known to be Dwight Calhoun

They stopped him and asked

He answered affirmatively and

He responded that he had

10

answered the door by opening the inner door.

11

officers' authority and purpose.

12

and the door was then broken down by the police.

13

He realized the

He slammed that door shut

Mr. Summers was then brought inside the dwelling

14

and taken into the living room.

15

secured, and by that I mean, once Mr. Summers and the other

16

seven persons who were present in the house at the time were

17

gathered in the living room, one officer

18

ties in executing the warrant went to the basement to search,

19

and there he found heroin, in the basement.

20

Once the premises were

as part of his du­

Mr. Summers was then arrested for the possession

21

of this heroin, the heroin found in the basement, and a search

22

of his person incident to that arrest revealed heroin also

23

in his jacket pocket.

24

which ultimately formed the basis of the charge against him.

25

He was bound over for trial on that charge but the charge was

It was the heroin in his jacket pocket

4

1

dismissed by the trial judge.

The Michigan Court of Appeals

2

affirmed that dismissal, holding that the arrest for posses­

3

sion of the heroin in the basement was without probable

4

cause because the officers did not possess sufficient facts

5

to sustain conviction on that charge.

6

Appeals also rejected the argument that Mr. Summers could

7

be searched under the authority of the warrant itself.

8

The Michigan Supreme Court granted leave on those issues but

9

decided the case on a different issue after this Court's

The Michigan Court of

10

decision in Dunaway v. New York, holding that the initial

1 1

detention of Mr. Summers when he was brought from the porch

12

inside the house was without probable cause and that being

13

without probable cause it was unconstitutional.

14

Court then granted certiorari.

15

And this

It is our position, first, that the search of

16

Mr. Summers was justifiable under the search warrant itself,

17

that a search warrant for private premises allows a search

18

of reasonable scope and intensity of persons present on the

19

premises where the items particularized in the warrant might

20

be found on the person.

21

in this case --

22
23

QUESTION:

Now, it is true that the officers

This would go to anybody who was on the

premises ?

24

MR. BAUGHMAN:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct, anyone.

Under your theory, if there were, let us
5

1

say, six or eight men in the house and, as the officers en­

2

tered, all of them rushed toward the door and wanted to get

3

out, they could be stopped long enough, on your theory, to

4

fulfill the purposes of the warrant?

5

MR. BAUGHMAN:

That's correct.

It would be -- in

6

this case there in fact were eight persons on the premises,

7

and under our first argument the search, that the people

8

could be searched under the warrant itself, all those persons'

9

pockets, their outer clothing, could be searched for the

10

items named in the warrant, assuming, as in this case, that

1 1

the items are of the type which could be concealed or found

12

on the person.

13

that, then they could not be searched, because it would not

14

be reasonable to expect to find the: items on the person.

15

If there was typewriters or something like

The officers did not, of course, in this case

16

search Mr. Summers on the basis of the warrant, but this

17

Court has held that it is not necessary that the officers

18

have the subjective legal justification which supports their

19

action so long

20

action which was taken.

21

happened in this case, that the search warrant does support

22

the search of Mr. Summers.

And we submit that that is what

You don't think it supports -- you don't

think you could hold a person just because, if you find some­

thing in the house, you could arrest the owner of the house?

Mr. Summers simply as they could have searched a nightstand

8

10

That's another argument?

MR. BAUGHMAN:

5

6

It's first our position that without

QUESTION:

Right; right.

QUESTION:

Going back to the hypothetical I gave you,

which by coincidence happens to be the same number, is it
your theory that if the eight people immediately wanted to
dash out of the house, the officers would have no way of
knowing which was the owner or who were the owners, and there­

14

fore they could detain all of them long enough to consummate

15

the execution of the warrant?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

16

That's correct.

And in fact, it

17

would be our theory, as I will explain more fully In a moment,

18

that even if a person were to say, I am not the owner, I am

19

a visitor or I am a neighbor, that the officers would not have

20

to rely on that declaration, but that they would nonetheless

21

be allowed under the authority of the warrant to search all

22

the persons present on the premises for the items named, in

23

this case for heroin, if the items might be found on the

24

person.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Baughman, is there a presumption
7

1

in Michigan that the owner of the house is responsible for

2

what's in it?

3

MR. BAUGHMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

No, there's not.

In thought that would be a solution to

your problem.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

6

Unfortunately, no, there's not.

7

fact, the Michigan Court of Appeals based Its decision in

8

part on the fact that under a peculiar Michigan law it's

9

circumstantial evidence.

In

Michigan holds -- however, there's

10

some dispute as to this -- that you need to negative all

11

theories consistent with innocence to support a conviction on

12

circumstantial evidence.

13

there is more than one occupant of the home, you can't con­

14

vict anybody for possession of an item found in a common

15

area.

16
17

QUESTION:

And therefore, ordinarily, when

Did you present this first theory that

you are presenting to us, below?

18

MR. BAUGHMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Yes.

That was rejected?
That was rejected by the Michigan

21

Court of Appeals, although the Michigan Supreme Court granted

22

leave on that issue and in fact did not grant leave on the

23

detention issue, which they ultimately decided the case on.

24

They didn't reach the search warrant issue.

25

QUESTION:

But the way the events happened, they
8

didn't search the men until after they had found something

2

else in the house?

MR.

That's correct.

We would take that

position, although we will also argue alternatively that the

Michigan Supreme Court was wrong in assuming this Court

1 1

would reject the ground that he could be searched under the

authority of the warrant.

13

less could have been detained, and once the heroin was found

in the basement they did have probable cause to arrest him,

Ybarra.

patrons in the bar.

We believe first, that this is distin­

2

guishable in that Mr. Summers had a relationship to the pre­

3

mises in this case, the premises to be searched, and that he

4

was an occupant-owner of the premises; whereas the patrons

5

in the Aurora Tap-Tavern in Ybarra had no nexus to the pre­

6

mises at all.
Under a traditional scope and intensity analysis,

7

8

a search warrant allows the search of places within the pre­

9

mises where it's reasonable to believe that the items might

10

be found.

11

drawers but you could search for packages of heroin in desk

12

drawers.

13

Of course you can't search for typewriters in desk

We believe that Ybarra should be read for the pro­

14

position that it is not reasonable to expect to find items

15

named in a search warrant on patrons in a place of public

16

accommodation, but we do contend that the showing of probable

17

cause which was required to justify the intrusion into the

18

private dwelling in this case should be viewed as compre­

19

hending within its scope a search of persons on the premises

20

who have a nexus to the premises --

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Baughman, is there anything that

22

would prevent you when you apply for the warrant to ask the

23

magistrate to include in the scope of the area to be searched

24

all persons found on the premises?

25

MR. BAUGHMAN:

That's correct, sir.
10

That could be

1

done, but

2

QUESTION:

It wasn't done here?

3

MR. BAUGHMAN:

That was not done here.

But our

4

point is that a search warrant is an anticipatory authoriza­

5

tion to search.

6

the application for the search warrant or have detailed in

7

the authorization that you wish to search all nighstands

8

found in premises, or you would not have to detail that you

9

wish to search all closets or all shelves.

10

For example, you would not have to state in

The warrant

authorizes that by allowing a search of the premises.
Now, if persons may be searched under a warrant for

1 1

12

premises because the items might be found on their person,

13

as they might be found in desk drawers or nightstands --

14

QUESTION:

Or in clothes in the closet.

15

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Correct.

then I don't believe that

16

adding that language necessarily serves any purpose,

17

although of course we'd be very happy --

18

QUESTION:

Of course --

19

MR. BAUGHMAN:

20

QUESTION:

-- if the police had done that.

The magistrate would normally assume

21

you'd search the nightstands.

22

gan normally assume that everybody in the premises would also

23

be searched?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

24

25

that.

Would the magistrates in Michi­

No, I don't think they would assume

I don't know if they would assume -11

QUESTION:

Isn't this really a question of constru­

ing the warrant?

3

4

Which would be kind of a matter of local

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, I think -- I think the Michigar.

5

Court of Appeals held that the particularity requirement pre­

6

vented them from viewing a warrant for premises as including

7

the persons on the premises within it, but they --

8

QUESTION:

As a matter of the Fourth Amendment?

9

MR. BAUGHMAN:

They said the particularity require­

10

ment referred to Marin v. United States, so I think they were

11

referring to the Fourth Amendment.

12
13

QUESTION:

Well, now you've got me confused.

they didn't search him until after they found the dope?

14

MR. BAUGHMAN:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

But

That's correct.

So they didn't assume that this warrant

authorized them to search him?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

No.

Right?
That's correct.

That is, the

18

police, I think it's fair to say, did not search Mr. Summers

19

on the basis of the warrant, but I think that search can

20

nonetheless be justified on the basis of the warrant, because

21

his person is a place within the premises where the items

22

might be found.

23

QUESTION:

But we're reviewing here the decision

24

of the Supreme Court of Michigan, are we not?

25

they took the case and decided it on a different ground than

detention issue, as they decided, doesn't necessarily end

authority of the warrant.

QUESTION:

So, in effect, you would say, they neces­

sarily rejected this position?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

I think that could fairly be said,

12

that it needed to be reached and wasn't.

13

explain exactly why they didn't, but I don't believe, if this

14

Court were to find or that court were to find that Mr. Summers

15

could have been searched under the warrant, then their deci­

16

sion on the detention issue did not end the case, or solve

17

the case, and of course our cert, petition raised all three

18

issues, which this Court granted. I believe the issue is •

19

properly here.

20

QUESTION:

21

Appeals, wasn't it?

22
23

I can't really

Well, it was rejected in the Court of

MR. BAUGHMAN:

It was rejected in the Court of

Appeals, explicitly.

24

The nexus to the premises distinction, which I've

25

just made as to why, as to how this case is distinguishable
13

1

from Ybarra, because Mr. Summers did have a nexus to the

2

premises, is a sufficient, but we submit it to be not a

3

necessary distinction between the two cases, because we be­

4

lieve that more importantly, as I mentioned earlier to

5

Mr. Justice Stevens in answer to his question, is the fact

6

that this was a private residence rather than a place of

7

public accommodation.

8

of the person to the premises or the nexus test is that in

9

most cases the police will not have any idea of the rela­

The difficulty with the relationship

10

tionship of the people to the premises, and in fact people

11

may lie about their relationship to the premises if questions

12

are asked.

13

As Judge Campbell said in the Micheli case, which

14

is cited in our brief, "When the stranger in the betting

15

parlor solemnly announces that he is the family doctor, I

16

would not require the police to believe him or inquire fur­

17

ther before searching his bag."

18

Now, that case, of course, involved the search of

19

personal effects rather than the person, but I believe the

20

logic of the decision applies

21

person is to be searched under the authority of the warrant,

22

a nexus test, we believe, is not an appropriate test to be

23

required, that this Court should allow the search of the

24

person on the premises simply because it is reasonable to

25

believe that the items named in the warrant might be in

also'

14

to

persons.

If a

Particularly when a knock-and-announce requirement

2
3

is considered, and Michigan has a knock-and-announce statute and

4

case law which requires that the officers wait until a person

5

in the room furthest from the door can get to the door to

6

answer it.

7

sidered, the authority to search persons on the premises

8

makes sense.

9

Particularly when those requirements are con­

I would hasten to add here that although I am

10

pointing out that the fact that the warrant could be frus­

1 1

trated is a justification for allowing a search of persons

12

on the premises,

13

Court to allow a search of persons on private premises under

14

the authority of the warrant simply because it's reasonable

15

to believe that persons on the premises might have the items

16

on their person.

17

it's not the sole one.

We are asking this

People are protected by --

QUESTION:

And you added before that you have no

18

way of knowing at the threshold who is the owner or who are

19

the owners, and who may be customers, visitors, or neighbors.

20

MR. BAUGHMAN:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

That's correct.

In this case --

How long a period do you have to resolve

that dilemma?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

It would be our position that the

24

police do not have to resolve that dilemma.

25

search all the persons on the premises, the outer clothing,

They may simply

But if they search and find that the

man's got a big packet of heroin in his pocket, do you mean
they're not going to arrest him?

1 1

MR. BAUGHMAN:

QUESTION:

13

MR. BAUGHMAN:

14

Because as Judge

No, then these -- the person --

He would be arrested, then, in your -He may be arrested for possessing

the heroin; yes.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BAUGHMAN:

In your submission?
For example, in this case, if the

17

officers had immediately searched Mr. Summers under the

18

authority of the warrant rather than searching the basement

19

first and finding heroin, and found the heroin in his pocket,

20

he would have been arrested for possessing that heroin.

21

search warrant gave reason to believe that there was heroin

22

on the premises and one place it was was in his pocket, and

23

he would be arrested for possessing it.

24
25

QUESTION:

The

But how would a person satisfy the

officers on the ground at the time that he was neither the
16

1

owner nor had any connection with the premises if it turned

2

out that he had no contraband on his person?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

3

Well, if he had no contraband on his

4

person I'd assume that he would not be arrested and there

5

wouldn't be any need to -QUESTION:

6
7

But he would have been detained long

enough to --

8

MR. BAUGHMAN:

9

QUESTION:

Submit to the search.

MR. BAUGHMAN:

10

-- be searched.

That's correct, but in many occa­

11

sions, I would Imagine, a search warrant may be authorized

12

for a particular place or a particular person where in fact

13

there is no contraband and none will ever be found.

14

will have submitted to the search and nothing will have been

15

found and they will go on their way and there will be no

16

arrest.

17

QUESTION:

A person

Yes, but I take it your second position

18

is that even if they'd have searched him on the doorstep and

19

found nothing on him, that you would have been authorized to

20

hold him until the search of the house was over?

21

MR. BAUGHMAN:

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's correct.

And if --

On the grounds that if you find

23

something in the house you will have reasonable cause to

24

arrest him.

25

MR. BAUGHMAN:

It's not our position that that's why
17

1

he can be held during the search to see if they might later

2

arrest him.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. BAUGHMAN:

What is it?
In order to assure the full and

5

faithful execution of the warrant, that all the persons on

6

the premises should be able to be detained during the execu­

7

tion of the warrant.

8

items could be picked up and hidden, and to protect the

9

officers, while they execute the warrant, from people milling

10

about or even from going outside and causing them some harm.

1 1
12

It avoids frustration in that the

QUESTION:

You mean, if they searched him right

away, they could say that nevertheless you --

13

MR. BAUGHMAN: Wait here until we execute the warrant

14

Stay in the spot.

15

while we execute the search warrant, and then when we're done

16

you can be released.

MR. BAUGHMAN:

That's correct, but --

You wouldn't say that the warrant gives

you the right to search people out in front of the building?

MR. BAUGHMAN:

No, but I think, I would argue --

Well, how did he get inside?
I would argue that the warrant gives

-- if the warrant gives authority to search people on the

MR. BAUGHMAN:

No, not necessarily.

I think if a

already executing, that wouldn't necessarily give them

grounds to search those persons. It's persons on or departing

any reasonable man that this person could

A man in a mailman's

outfit is walking out with a pouch.

I think they could not

20

search him under the authority of the warrant, but if, as the

21

officers approached to execute a search warrant, a suitcase

22

came flying out the window, I would think that the fact that

23

the suitcase is now outside the premises would not remove It

24

from coverage of the warrant, because it had just been inside.

25

1

the fact that they were observed to depart in the eyes of

2

the officers as they approached shouldn't moot the question.

3

The question remains, can they be searched under the authority

4

of the warrant or can't they?

We submit that they can.

5

But even if they can't, or if they have been and

6

nothing found, we submit that in this case that respondent

7

could be searched and that the heroin in his jacket pocket

8

was nonetheless properly discovered because the warrant itself

9

should be viewed as granting authority to the executing offi­

10

cers to detain persons on or departing from the premises

1 1

for a period of time which is reasonable and necessary to

12

insure the full and faithful execution of the warrant.

13

we say that without regard to any individualized suspicion

14

that any particular person on the premises is engaged in

15

criminal activity.

QUESTION:

And

Are you suggesting that the totality of

the circumstances is sort of the rule that applies here?

18

MR. BAUGHMAN:

What we're asking for is, rather

19

than a necessarily a case-by-case analysis, is for this Court

20

to recognize a generic class, if you will, of detentions for­

I think you ought to make a distinction

11

between the mailman and the man in the mailman's uniform,

because if he's a legitimate mailman and you arrest him,

13

I think you're going to be in a little trouble.

14

MR. BAUGHMAN:

I believe that's probably correct.

15

I think that the example given was probably a courier acting

as a mailman.

QUESTION:

I assume that's what the Chief Justice

meant was the man in the uniform.

19

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Our position is, on this detention

20

issue, that the Fourth Amendment contains two separate and

21

independent clauses, a reasonableness clause and a warrant

22

clause, and that the warrant clause is

23

the probable cause concept, but that arrests, seizures of

24

the person, do not generally fall within the warrant clause

25

and that even when they do, as in Payton v. New York,
23

textually linked to

the concern of the Court is not with the warrantless seizure

2

of the person but with the warrantless entering into the

dwelling

effectuate that arrest.

So we believe that seizures of the person should be

4

5

reviewed for reasonableness and that detention of the persons

6

on or departing from private premises when a search warrant

7

is about to be executed is a class of reasonable detentions

8

under the Fourth Amendment.

9

from this Court in our brief, and this Court always expresses

striking a balance between the public in­

10

the

11

terest and the individual's right to personal security free

12

from the arbitrary interfferehce by laW enforcement officials.

13

And we believe that the teaching of those cases is

14

that detentions are constitutional, if reasonable.

15

that reasonableness is a balancing between governmental

16

interest and the individual's interest in personal liberty.

17

The more severe the intrusion, the more information and the

higher the governmental interest that's required to justify

it.

20

what we would call probable cause in the traditional sense,

21

because as stated by Chief Justice Warren in the Terry case,

22

an arrest is the initial stage in a criminal prosecution and

23

it is inevitably accompanied by future interference with the

24

individual's freedom of movement, whether or not trial and

that a search warrant itself should be viewed as authorizing

The governmental interest in allowing this class

14

of detentions, we believe, is a weighty one, insuring the

have to knock-and-announce.

It would seem to me that a

that Mr. Summers was coming out changes our position.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOTT SCHULDER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

8
9
10

Mr. Schulder.

MR. SCHULDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In the brief time available to me I would like to

1 1

address the aspect of this case that is of primary concern

12

to the Federal Government.

13

We view this case and the decision of the Michigan

14

Supreme Court as sweeping well beyond the context of the

15

execution of a search warrant.

16

the Michigan Supreme Court properly read this Court's decision

17

in Dunaway v. New York, to hold that any detention of a sus­

18

pect beyond a momentary stop for brief questioning is not

19

permissible under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of its

20

reasonbleness, unless the officer has probable cause to arrest

21

the suspect on criminal charges.

The question here is whether

22

We believe that this decision is inconsistent with

23

this Court's basic approach in this area of Fourth Amendment

24

law, and that it unjustifiably precludes law enforcement

25

officers from engaging inappropriate and legitimate law
29

1

enforcement investigative activities.

2

In Dunaway the Court held that the detention of a

3

suspect for custodial interrogation required probable cause

4

for his arrest.

We believe that that was undoubtedly a

5

correct result.

The detention process itself is an unstruc­

6

tured and potentially open-ended one.

7

Stevens noted in his concurring opinion in Dunaway, the

8

possibility of obtaining a confession may increase in direct

9

proportion to the length of the detention.

Moreover, as Justice

Most importantly,

10

we submit, the police could prolong investigative stops in

11

every case on the basis of reasonable suspicion, if they

12

could simply justify the detention on the need for continued

13

interrogation.

14

allowed prolonged detention in that case simply on the justi­

15

fication of custodial interrogation, would have permitted

16

the police to go well beyond the narrow confines of the rea­

17

sonable-suspicion-stop standard that the Court developed in

18

Terry and its progeny.

19

Thus, as the Court held in Dunaway, to have

However, as Mr. Justice White emphasized in his

20

concurring opinion in Dunaway, there is room within the

21

Fourth Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness

22

standard, to accommodate certain exceptions to the normal

23

rule of probable cause where flexibility is essential.

24

provides a case in point.

25

tary.

Terry

The detention in Terry was momen­

It occurred as the officer observed Terry and his
30

1

companions parading around in front of a store and looking

2

as if they were about to commit daylight armed robbery.

3

officer in that case approached, asked a question of the sus­

4

pects, and when the suspects muttered a response he seized

zure was so different from the type of intrusion that accom­

10

panies an arrest, the Court found that there was a narrow ex­

13

Now, in subsequent cases, the Court has applied the

Terry reasonable suspicion standard to stops of automobiles

And

suspicion at all.

2

The Michigan Supreme Court in this case held that

3

any detention for more than a brief or momentary period is

4

per se unreasonable in the absence of probable cause without

5

regard to the particular circumstances that may justify the

6

detention.

7

to the Fourth Amendment's central notion of reasonableness,

8

it's also unduly restrictive of legitimate law enforcement

9

activities.

We believe that this approach is not only contrary

There are numerous occasions when a suspect's

10

responses to an officer's questions may intensify the offi­

11

cer's suspicions and yet not necessarily provide probable

12

cause to arrest.

13

In these situations the police may attempt to main­

14

tain the status quo for a limited period in order to deter­

15

mine whether to arrest or release the suspect.

16

out in our brief, we have given several examples, such as

17

the situation where the police responding to a report of a

18

burglary or robbery see a suspect near the scene of a crime,

19

pick him up, and return him to the scene for possible iden­

20

tification at a show-up.

22

reported as stolen. Under the Michigan Supreme Court' s decision

As we pointed

Similarly there is a situation in­

They then radio in to headquarters

32

1

in this case these reasonable examples of good police work

2

would not survive constitutional scrutiny.

3

We wish to stress that our position here will not

4

leave the police in an unstructured situation where they may

5

arbitrarily detain suspects for extended periods on no more

6

than a whim.

7

reasonable articulable suspicion that the individual is in­

8

volved in criminal activity before he may stop the individual

9

for brief inquiry.

In the first place, the officer must have

detain the individual further1

10

after the individual has

11

the officer must have in mind a specific, independent avenue

12

of investigation that requires the continued presence of the

13

suspect, and that is reasonably likely to resolve the matter

14

one way or the other, that is, whether to release or arrest

15

the suspect within a relatively short time. The police may

16

not detain a suspect on the basis of a vague hope that some­

17

how evidence of his criminal conduct will materialize.

MR. SCHULDER:

Under our rationale, the police

would not be authorized to stop a person simply because he

2

happens to be, and detain a person for the entire duration of

3

the execution of the warrant, simply because he happens to be

4

leaving the premises.
QUESTION:

5

That would not constitute sufficient

6

reasonable suspicion that he had some connection to criminal

7

activity?

8
9

10

MR. SCHULDER:

That's correct.

If the police made

inquiry and determined that the person lived on the premises
or had some kind of ongoing connection with the premises --

11

QUESTION:

Which they did here.

12

MR. SCHULDER:

Oh.

Certainly.

I was about to say

13

that the detention in this case fits perfectly within our

14

theory, that is, as the respondent was leaving the house, the

15

police stopped him, they ascertained that he lived on the

16

premises, and they detained him there during the execution of

17

the warrant.

18

We justify, in contrast to the State, the primary

19

justification for the detention in our view -- and I'd like

20

to address something that Justice White had mentioned earlier

21

-- our primary, the way we view the case, the primary justifi­

22

cation for detention here is to see whether or not the police

23

would have sufficient evidence to arrest the respondent after

24

the search was completed.

25

QUESTION:

We believe that --

Suppose there was clear Fourth Amendment
34

1

law to the effect that just because you discover heroin in a

2

house doesn't mean you have probable cause to arrest anybody

on the premises?
MR. SCHULDER:

4

Well, we would still say that deten­

5

tion of a person for the period, of a person connected with

6

the premises for the period of ascertaining whether there was

7

or was not drugs or other contraband sought in the warrant,

8

would still be reasonable.

MR. SCHULDER:

We would agree with

that submission.

I'm giving you the facts.

Would a

policeman in his right mind not want to search every person

weapons that would -MR. SCHULDER:

I would agree that a policeman

QUESTION:

For his own safety?

15

MR. SCHULDER:

For his own safety; and the Fourth

Amendment would not preclude him from taking that type of

17

action.
QUESTION: Well, It might be different for the

18

search for some other kind of a commodity.

In this particular case a search warrant was

Now, if that examining magistrate was sufficiently

convinced that a search warrant should be issued for persons

or a person, that would have been done.

QUESTION:

Is it frequent, frequent in Michigan

that search warrants are issued to search people?

Not if they want a search warrant.

8

In this particular case they wanted a search warrant for the

premises.

If they have names of persons or a person with a

10

sufficient description that satisfies the requirement of the

1 1

magistrate, such search warrant -- and it's very common in

12

Michigan and in Detroit, where this case originated, for the

13

search warrant to specify not only the contraband to be

14

seized and that the house be searched for such items, but

15

also any person or persons.

16

QUESTION:

Well, the Fourth Amendment says that

the persons to be seized.

MR. LORENCE:

QUESTION:

MR. LORENCE:

25

Now, is that

what you do in

Yes.

You specify the persons to be seized -Yes.

Or searched?
Place to be seized, and -- place to

be searched and a person to be seized.
38

1

QUESTION:

Well, that's different.

2

QUESTION:

Do you think there's a difference betweer

3

a public place like a bar, the bar in Ybarra, and a private

4

dwelling?

5

MR. LORENCE:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

I think that

6

a person, contrary to what's been said here, should have and

7

does have greater rights in his residence, in a private place,

8

than in a public place.

9

ment rights to the patrons of that bar and the prosecutor

Ybarra guarantees the Fourth Amend­

10

-- or, it is the petitioner here, is asserting that a person

11

in his own private dwelling, or in this particular place in

12

this particular situation, outside the private dwelling, has

13

less rights.

14

QUESTION:

Well, is there anything to the notion

15

that in a public bar or restaurant there is no assumption

16

that any one of the individuals has any connection with or

17

knowledge of the others, whereas in a private home, if you

18

have eight people there, there Is some possibly reasonable

19

assumption that they have some connection with each other,

20

or they wouldn't be gathered there?

21

MR. LORENCE:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. LORENCE:

That may be so, but I think --

May be?

Or is?

-- the individual, wherever he is,

24

has a right of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, and I

25

don't think just the mere fact that somebody lives in a
39

1

house -- and that's the only information that the police

2

officers had when they detained and seized the respondent in

3

this case -- was sufficient probable cause, and it wasn't a

4

reason to detain him, and wasn't a reason, wouldn't be a

5

reason to search him.
QUESTION:

6

Well, do you say there has to be pro­

7

bable cause in the constitutional sense of the Fourth

8

Amendment in order for any sort of detention to take place?
MR.

9

LORENCE:

Well, in this particular situation,

10

after the search warrant was gotten, and they, the police

11

officers -- and you're talking about seven police officers,

12

a precinct narcotic unit, coming up the street, getting out

13

of their vehicles, and stopping and detaining the respondent

14

in this matter outside the premises.

15

a right -QUESTION:

16
17

Knowing that he just came out of the

house?
MR. LORENCE:

18
19

Knowing that he just came out of the

house.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. LORENCE:

22

I think they had

No dispute about that?
Well, that's what they said, that

they saw him coming out of the house.

23

QUESTION: But on the premises in the sense that he

24

is on the land to which that house is attached? On the door­

25

step?
40

1

MR. LORENCE:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. LORENCE:

Well, we --

Was he or wasn't he?
Yes.

We call it curtilage.

I know

4

this Court hasn't spoken of curtilage, probably, in 40 or 50

5

years, but he was not inside the premises, he wasn't on

6

the porch, he was on the sidewalk going to the street.

7

Detroit is uncommon to many other places in terms of the way

8

people live in housing structures.

9

of single dwelling homes in our city as opposed to Washington

We have a predominance

10

or New York, where there are many apartment structures, and

1 1

sometimes the buildings come right up to the sidewalk.

12

we have a single dwelling home in a residential area, as a

13

matter of fact, across the street from a school, and there is

14

a porch that comes out of the house, then there are steps,

15

and then there is a walk down to the common sidewalk that goes

16

along the street and then some area between that sidewalk

17

and the street.

18

Here

Now, when the police officers came up and detained

19

Mr. Summers, they had a right under Terry to do that.

20

lieve they do.

23

that it warranted a search or a pat-down.

But they didn't do that.

They did

you can do on less than probable cause, then, is a pat-down

MR. LORENCE:
case, yes.

4

5

Under the situation in this particular

QUESTION:

Well, generally?

I mean, how about

Martinez-Fuerte, Brignoni-Ponce, Pennsylvania v. Mimms?

6

MR. LORENCE:

Well, I think under certain cases

7

there are limited inquiry.

8

about, doesn't a police officer have a right to come up to

9

an individual on the street and ask him a question?

I mean, this Court has spoken

Now,

10

the respondent here wasn't exactly on the street, but I do

1 1

think that they had a right to come up and inquire.

12

made an inquiry.

13

I live here.

14

Do you live here?

They

The respondent said, yes.

Now, I think that the police officers had a right

15

for a brief momentary detention to inquire, to guarantee

16

their safety, to find out, who is this man?

17

here?

18

police inquiry.

19

Do you live

At that particular point, I think that is legitimate

QUESTION:

Well, how about the fact that he lives

20

there and they have a warrant to search the place for drugs?

21

Doesn't that permit further inquiry of him?

22

MR. LORENCE:

23

QUESTION:

24

25

But they didn't inquire anything.

Well, doesn't that permit further de­

tention of him?
MR. LORENCE:

I don't believe so.
42

I think that

1

after that, that detention was a seizure and it was in vio­

2

lation of his Fourth Amendment right.

3

the circumstances that seizure took place the minute they

4

turned him around, and they took him back onto the porch.

5

6

QUESTION:

But would it make any difference, then,

whether he lived there or not, under your theory?

7

8

And I feel that under

MR. LORENCE:

Whether or not this was an illegal

detention?

9

QUESTION:

Suppose he said that, I do not live

10

here?

1 1

say the same thing when he answered that he could live there.

12

You would say they could not detain him.

MR. LORENCE:

And you woulc

Well, I don't believe that they would

13

have any probable cause to detain him under the facts of this

14

particular case, of the respondent.

15

situation I think they would have even less to detain him.

16

I think the mere fact that they detained him was an intrusion

17

on his expectation and right of privacy.

18

QUESTION:

And in your particular

I'm merely saying that, as I understand

19

your theory, it doesn't make any difference whether he said

20

he lived there or that he did not live there.

21

22
23

MR. LORENCE:

Unless they had anything further;

unless they had probable cause to do what they did.
QUESTION:

Well, so if their detention was to simply

24

question and ask him whether he lived there, and the reply

25

under your theory was bound to be unhelpful for the police
43

1

one way or the other.

2

ask him whether he lived there or not?

3

Why do you say they had a right to

MR. LORENCE:

I said, yes.

I think they could ask

4

to have, the police had a right to ask him.

5

your question, they asked him a question which I believe

6

they legitimately had a right to ask.

7

QUESTION:

If I understand

But surely my brothers Blackmun and

8

Rehnquist are correct, aren't they, in what their question

9

suggests, that if you are correct, that it was violative of

10

your client's constitutional rights,to seize him after he

11

said, yes, he lived there? Certainly you would be correct if

12

the answer had been, no, I don't live here.

13

MR. LORENCE:

14

QUESTION:

15

Correct.

In other words, it didn't make any dif­

ference what the answer to the question was.

16

MR. LORENCE:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's correct.

While the -- certainly the police were,

18

as you can see, were free to ask the question, it was kind of

19

a pointless question if whatever the answer was, they were

20

powerless to do anything about it.

21

22
23

25

MR. LORENCE:

Well, this Court has already respond­

ed in terms of a situation like that.
QUESTION:
stand that.

Well, that's your submission.

I under­

That's the issue in this case.

MR. LORENCE:

He could have said, goodbye.
44

I don't

1

want to answer your questions, and walk off; at least, try to

2

walk off.
QUESTION:

3

If he says, I'm just an encyclopedia

4

salesman, and was only in the house for a few minutes, do

5

they have to believe him?
MR. LORENCE:

6
7

that would be evasive and give the police room.
QUESTION:

8
9

might

be

Well, he might -- let's assume he

an encyclopedia salesman.
MR. LORENCE:

10
11

I think that would be a -- I think

out of this house?
QUESTION:

12

At 10:10 p.m. on a dark night, coming

I have some question about that.
And yet you say that, when he said, no,

13

I live here, it was a violation of his rights.

14

gest it would not have been if he'd said he didn't live there

15

but was just a casual visitor, in your answer to the Chief

16

Justice just now.

How can that follow?

MR. LORENCE:

17

But you sug­

I think that whether or not he

18

responds either way, they have a right to ask that question

19

and he has a right to answer any way he wants.

20

lieve that it gives any reason for the police to be sus­

21

picious, to detain him, to take him back into the premises.

I don't be­

22

QUESTION:

That's what I thought your position was.

23

QUESTION:

Well, that's a meaningless charade,

24

then.

25

regardless of what answer they get from him, they can do

You say they have a right to ask him the question but

45

1

nothing that they couldn't have done had they never asked

2

the question in the first place.

3

QUESTION:

That's your position?

4

QUESTION:

What if he said, it's none of your busi­

5

ness?

6

MR. LORENCE:

7

QUESTION:

8

extra reason?

And that doesn't give the officers any

That's what you suggest?

MR. LORENCE:

9

I think he has a right to say that.

Right?

Well, they have a search warrant for

10

the premises.

11

they didn't even have any description in their search warrant

12

that a person of the respondent's character and description

13

was wanted.

14

They didn't have a search warrant for him,

QUESTION:

Well, suppose the police have, are sud­

15

denly told by a man who comes into the police station that

16

he's just come from an address, and he knows that one of the

17

undercover agents has been murdered in that house by somebody

18

in that house.

19

dead and somebody did it there.

20

everybody agrees there's probable cause to go search the

21

house, and they get a warrant to search the house, and as

22

they approach here come six people out of the house.

23

they detain them until they've -- all they're trying to, see

24

if there's a dead man in the house?

25

not. •

He doesn't know who did it, but he knows he's

46

And they go to the -- and

Can't

You say, no, absolutely

1

MR. LORENCE:

2

QUESTION:

So I

They have probable cause, everybody

3

concedes that probable cause to believe that somebody in that

4

house killed somebody and that the body's there.
MR. LORENCE:

5

6

In this particular situation of the

respondent, they didn't have any probable cause.

7

QUESTION: But how about my question?

8

MR. LORENCE:

9
10
1 1

Well, I think if there is probable

cause, that there is a reason to detain him, at least momen­
tarily .
QUESTION:

Each person?

Each person until they

12

find the body and then try to figure out who's responsible?

13

Do they have to -- can't they hold them for a reasonable time

14

to inquire, to see if they can find out which of the six

15

people may be implicated?

16
17
18

MR. LORENCE:

Or maybe they all are?

I think that they have a right to

make a Terry-type stop and investigation.
QUESTION:

Then that's all?

If the fellow, if --

19

in my example, if six people exit from the house and they

20

want to inquire, make some inquiries from them, and each of

21

them says, none of your business, they must let them go?

22
23
24
25

MR. LORENCE:

No, I think with the probable cause

that you have indicated -QUESTION:

Well, assume probable cause as I -- the

only facts I changed was change cocaine or drugs to a murder.
47

1

2
3
4

That's all.
MR. LORENCE:

No, you indicated that there was

probable cause.
QUESTION:

Well, probable cause, I said there was a

5

murder in the house and that somebody in the house was

6

responsible for it.

7

QUESTION:

What difference does it make whether

8

it's heroin or a dead body, for these purposes, if that's the

9

information?

10

MR. LORENCE:

I think the detention in the case of

11

the respondent with a search warrant in the hands of the

12

police officers is different from the circumstance that has

13

been given by Justice White.

14

any probable cause in the case of the respondent in my case

15

and there wasn't any reason to detain him, they didn't have

16

any probable cause.

17

that he lived in the premises.

18

where there is someone who indicates that someone was murderec

19

in this house, where you do have probable cause.

20

you have a right to detain.

21

QUESTION:

And I think that there isn't

Just the fact that he lived, he said
I think you have a situation

And I think

There are certain --

What's the difference?

In each case it's

22

a felony, one a little more gruesome than the other, perhaps,

23

and I'm not sure which is worse.

24

MR. LORENCE:

25

But what's the difference?

I think it comes down to the intru­

sion on a person's right against an illegal, unreasonable
48

1

stop and -QUESTION:

2

You mean it's all right to intrude if

3

maybe there's a dead body in there but it's not all right to

4

intrude if there is a lot of heroin?
MR. LORENCE:

5

I think that it comes down to any

6

situation where somebody coming out of the premises, like in

7

the particular case of the repondent, where they do not have

8

probable cause

9

comes out, that they do not have a right to detain any more

in terms of the respondent or any person that

10

than to make the inquiry of whether or not you live there or

1 1

what your name is, or what's your address, or to secure that

12

person in terms of any potential weapons, if the police

13

officers think that they have weapons.

14
15

QUESTION:

I've got a real problem.

The police

have a search warrant to search this house in this case?

16

MR. LORENCE:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And they search the house and they found

18

the heroin.

19

What should the police then do?

20

here until we get a warrant?

Right?

And this man said he lived in that house.
Say, would you mind waiting

21

MR. LORENCE: Outside the house, Your Honor?

22

QUESTION:

This very case.

After they found the

23

heroin, what should they have done insofar as this man was

24

concerned?

25

Turned him loose?
MR. LORENCE:

I don't -49

MR. LORENCE:

No, I don't think that they should

Well, I don't see anything wrong

10

with that.

They knew where'he lived, they had the ability to

11

get his name and address.

12

QUESTION:

They had his name and address then.

MR. LORENCE:

QUESTION:

15

MR. LORENCE:

16

QUESTION:

All right, they --

What should they have done?
Inside the house?

No, sir.

I --

My story is, after they found

17

the heroin and they came out and looked at him and said,

18

you're the one who said you lived in that house, right?

19

that stage, what should they have done?

20

MR. LORENCE:

They

should

have

advised

At

him

21

of his Miranda warnings, because a police officer said that

22

he made an initial --

23
24

25

QUESTION:

And could they have arrested him after

the Miranda warnings?
MR. LORENCE:

I don't think that they had probable
50

1

cause to arrest him.

2

QUESTION:

Well, what should they do, let him go?

MR. LORENCE:

than to let him go.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Well, your final answer to Justice

Well, if you're correct, they wouldn't

have had him, he wouldn't have been there.
MR. LORENCE:

If I was correct, they wouldn't have

taken him inside the premises.

15
16

Now, I'd like to go back,

that point?

13
14

Yes.

Marshall's question is that they simply have to let him go at

But to let him go?

Your Honors, to --

I think that they had no other choice

He wouldn't have been there at the time

they discovered narcotics in the basement.

MR. LORENCE:

QUESTION: If you're correct.

19

MR. LORENCE:

That's correct.

Right.

Now, let's go back to the

of the respondent back onto the porch and using him as an

22

instrument to gain entry into a premises.

The detention outside the premises involved taking

armed with flak jackets, long guns, guns drawn, and a battering

3

ram, coming up the walk, detaining the respondent -QUESTION:

4
5

Well, the narcotic trade uses those too,

you know.
MR. LORENCE:

6

Yes, but taking this civilian, not

7

knowing who he is other than the fact that he resides in the

8

house, I don't think under any rule justifies taking him to

9

that front door, using him as an instrument to gain entry --

10

QUESTION:

Yes, but it didn't work.

11

MR. LORENCE:

But battering that door down, knowing

12

as this Court has said many times what kind of actions and

13

activities go inside a place where drugs are kept or sold,

14

placed the respondent in a situation where he could have been

15

the first one to catch a salvo of gunshots and been killed

16

right on the spot.

17

QUESTION:

I think that -That sometimes has happened to the offi­

18

cers on the outside when they made the entry on the inside,

19

hasn't it?

MR. LORENCE:

That's correct, Your Honor, and police

officers in their difficult task take -QUESTION:

That's the rationale of Chief Justice

23

Warren in Terry, to try to make sure that at least the odds

24

are leveled off between --

25

MR. LORENCE:

And that's why Terry has become a
52

limited exception to the exclusionary rule.

2

a man who has not taken on the responsibility and the dangerous

3

responsibility that police officers take on, who is made a vol­

4

unteer who is placed in front of that door. He presses that

5

doorbell, yes, and the man that comes to the door sees that

6

there are people on that porch, slams the door, the battering

7

ram goes in, and Mr.

8

jacket, without any responsibility, to take care of himself.

9

He's placed in a position where I can't think of anything that's

10

more serious than this in terms of denying his personal liberties.

his conviction for heroin?

13

MR. LORENCE:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

But here you have

I believe that the detention --

Isn't there something missing in between

those two?
MR. LORENCE:

I think the detention, the violations

17

of his Fourth Amendment right were so severe outside the pre­

18

mises that their taking him into the premises denied him --

19

QUESTION:

Would your case be the same if they

20

didn't -- if they had left him outside in the street sitting

21

on a featherbed?

22

Would your position be the same?

MR. LORENCE:

If they had left him without any con­

23

trols, without any threat, then he was left to go his way

24

and to exercise his freedom of movement.

25

QUESTION:

That's not what I said.
53

I said, instead

1

of taking him to the front door, they had held him sitting on

2

a featherbed on the porch.

3

MR. LORENCE:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. LORENCE:

6

QUESTION:

7

No, I think any --

Would you be making the same argument?
Yes, the same argument.

Well, why -- oh, you think this just

adds on?

8

MR. LORENCE:

9

QUESTION:

The fact that they used him at the door?

10

QUESTION:

What if they'd simply asked him for the

1 1

Yes, I do.

key, if he said he lived there?
MR. LORENCE:

12

Well, if he had given them the key,

13

I think they still could not have seized him, detained him,

14

and taken him back into the premises.
QUESTION:

15

That would obviate

the necessity for

16

his going back and himself ringing the doorbell and exposing

17

himself to all this possible danger which you have just

18

described.

19

MR. LORENCE:

That's correct.

They didn't do that.

20

I think the detention, once they went onto the porch and took

21

him onto the porch, I think that was the detention, the sei­

22

zure, and the arrest.

23
24

25

QUESTION:

What if they had asked him for the key

and he'd said, I have it but I won't give it to you?
MR. LORENCE:

I think he had a right to keep
54

1

the key.

2

I don't think he had a duty to help them open up the door.

3

I don't think he had a duty to give them the key.

QUESTION:

Do you think that his refusal to give

4

them the key would have given the police grounds for any

5

additional inquiries or any additional detention?

6

MR. LORENCE:

I think perhaps they could have in­

7

quired but they didn't, in this particular matter, inquire

8

beyond the fact about, if whether or not he lived in the

9

premises, and whether or not he could open up - the door.

10

I think each human being has an expectation of

11

privacy which is guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment, and

12

any kind of intrusion beyond the exceptions that have been

13

carved out by this Court, like the border cases, like the

14

Terry-type search, I think are a violation of the person's

15

expectation of privacy, of his person.

16

particular situation the respondent came out of his premises

17

late at night.

18

was coming down the steps of his home, and down the sidewalk,

19

and when the officers detained him I think that violated his

20

Fourth Amendment right to privacy.

I think in this

22

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

23

No, you have some re­

maining time, until the red light goes on.

24

MR. LORENCE:

25

I think the history of the Fourth Amendment being

All right, thank you, Your Honor.

55

1

a colonial response to the English practice, against general

2

warrants, is a firm basis for this Court to continue the prac­

3

tice of holding that the Fourth Amendment guarantees each

4

individual a right to be secure in his person, his house,

5

his papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and

6

seizures.

9

QUESTION:

To continue the practice adopted in

1961 in Mapp v. Ohio?
MR. LORENCE:

Yes.

I don't believe that this

10

Court should carve out another exception in the Terry line,

11

in the border cases.

12

QUESTION:

13

in Mapp v. Ohio?

14

the Constitution.

15

Well, what do you think we were doing

We were certainly rewriting something in

MR. LORENCE:

But I don't think that it was de­

16

priving a person of his guaranteed right to be free from any

17

seizures or searches?

18
19

20

QUESTION:

No.

It was imposing a requirement on

the states that hadn't previously been imposed on them.
QUESTION:

We overruled Wolff v. Colorado and im­

21

posed upon the states, presumably as part of the Constitution,

22

the obligation to enforce an exclusionary rule.

23

what Mapp v. Ohio did.

24

MR. LORENCE:

25

That's

Right. And I think that the Court

should continue protecting an individual's Fourth Amendment
56

right and not expand the doctrine of Terry v. Ohio and the

2

border cases, and expand upon those to create anything in

5

tion like the respondent's, who have a search warrant for the

6

premises, detain and deprive a person of their right of

7

privacy on the outside of the premises for which they have

8

a search warrant, they could stop not only the mailman but

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE J. ENNIS, JR., ESQ.,

6

8

Thank you, Your Honors.

MR. ENNIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I greatly appreciate the Court's permission to ar­

10

gue as amicus in this complex and important case.

11

not address the merits.

12

both jurisdictional and policy grounds why the Court should

13

not resolve the merits in the unique circumstances of this

14

case, and should instead either dismiss the writ as improvi-

15

dently granted or remand for clarification.

16

I will

Rather, I will argue that there are

Briefly, as the trial court and the Court of Appeals

17

both ruled, there are adequate and independent state law

18

grounds that would support the same judgment and would re­

19

quire exclusion of the evidence regardless of this Court's

20

rulings on any of the federal questions presented by

21

petitioner.

22

QUESTION:

We have just heard from Michigan counsel

23

that the Supreme Court of Michigan decision rested on

24

federal grounds.

25

MR. ENNIS:

That is entirely correct, Your Honor.
58

1

The decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan did rest on a

2

federal ground.

That is cor­

Well, since when do we dismiss in those

circumstances ?
MR. ENNIS:

9

And on no state ground.

rect, Your Honor.

6
7

And on no state ground?

Your Honor, I think that the principle

that emerges from all of this Court's cases on adequate and

10

independent state law grounds is that this Court will not

11

review a state court judgment unless the decision on the

12

federal ground was necessary to that judgment and in this

13

case, given the rulings of the trial court and the Court of

14

Appeals which both reached the same judgment on state law

15

grounds, it cannot be said that it was necessary.
QUESTION:

16

But the highest court in the state has

17

now certainly given some indication that it thought it was

18

necessary.
MR. ENNIS:

19

Well, Your Honor, the highest court in

20

the state has not reached either of the state law grounds

21

that the trial court and the Court of Appeals both relied

22

upon.

23

QUESTION:

Would it be reasonable or would it be

24

unreasonable to infer from that that they thought they had

25

to reach the federal grounds?
59

MR. ENNIS:

1

2

Your Honor, I do not think that it

would be reasonable to infer from that fact that -QUESTION:

3

Ordinarily, the states' highest courts,

4

and particularly this one, in my observation, goes out of its

5

way to avoid a remand, and put it on state grounds, if they

6

can do it.
MR. ENNIS:

7

Your Honor, I can't second guess the

8

thinking behind the Michigan Supreme Court's majority opinion.

9

I can say that the Court of Appeals in Michigan is a single

10

court of appeals which has jurisdiction over the entire

11

state.

12

evidence in this case must be excluded.

13

That court has ruled on state law grounds that the

QUESTION:

Well, what do you do with Justice

14

Williams' dissent at Appendix 27, where it says, after his

15

name, "for reversal"?

16

thought that if his principles were accepted by the majority

17

of the Supreme'Court of Michigan, ’the' judgment of the Court

18

of Appeals would have been reversed.

19

MR. ENNIS:

I would assume from that that he

1

Well, let me be candid, Your Honor.

20

The case hinges on a Michigan case called People v. Davenport

21

and it is true that the minority of the Michigan Supreme

22

Court thought that the Court of Appeals and the trial court

23

had misinterpreted that People v. Davenport case, but the

24

majority did not go along with that view.

25

view whatsoever on the point.
60

They expressed no

It can be said, however, that in the majority of

1

2

the Michigan Supreme Court was Mr. Justice Levin, who, while

3

he was on the Court of Appeals, was the author of the People

4

v. Davenport opinion.

5

if there is some ambiguity about what the Michigan Supreme

6

Court would rule on these state law grounds, it certainly

7

cannot be said by this Court that Michigan law would author­

8

ize the detention and search in the circumstances of this

9

case.

At the very least, at the very least,

10

Now, given what Mr. Justice Jackson said for the

11

Court in Herb v. Pitcairn, that the Court from the time of

12

its foundation has adhered to the principle that it will not

13

review judgments of state courts that rest on adequate and

14

independent state grounds if the same judgment would be ren­

15

dered by the state courts after we corrected its views of

16

federal laws -QUESTION:

17

Mr. Ennis, supposing we sent it back and

18

the Michigan Supreme Court said, we don't care to decide the

19

Michigan view, we think that federal law requires this re­

20

sult.

21

and we're not going to say anything about state law.

22

can't make us say anything about state law.

23

them to decide it on state law grounds ?

24
25

We decided the case on that ground, that's our opinion,

MR. ENNIS:

They

How can we tell

Your Honor, this Court cannot force the

Michigan Supreme Court to decide the case on state law grounds.
61

QUESTION:

1

So if we dismiss the writ as improvi-

2

dently granted, its judgment will stand and it will stand on

3

federal grounds.
MR. ENNIS:

4

Your Honor, what could happen in that

5

circumstance is it could go back to the Michigan Supreme

6

Court and they could decide to decide the case on the state

7

law grounds for which they originally granted leave to appeal.
QUESTION:

8
9

If

we find that this writ is improvi-

dently granted, that would be the end of the line.

10

wouldn't go back to the Michigan Supreme Court.

11

you --

12

MR. ENNIS:

It

What do

Well, that's why I suggested, Your

13

Honor, that an alternative method of proceeding would be as

14

this Court did in Krivda, to vacate and remand to the

15

Supreme Court of Michigan for clarification.

16

QUESTION:

But on your submission, Mr. Ennis,

17

every case that comes to us from the highest court of a state

18

placing it openly on federal grounds and on no state grounds

19

would then lead us, if not require us, to remand to say,

20

isn't there a state ground on which you can reach this

21

result?

22

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, I think not, because I'm

23

not arguing for the purely speculative possibility that there

24

might be a state law ground.

25

the previous cases I am aware of in this Court on adequate

This case is unique from all

62

1

state law ground issues in that both the trial court and the

2

Court of Appeals did expressly rule on state law grounds, so

3

it is not speculative to suggest that there might be a state

4

law ground.

In fact, there has been a ruling that there is.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ENNIS:

7

QUESTION:

Are those judgments before us?

8

MR. ENNIS:

Which judgments, Your Honor?

9

QUESTION:

10
11
12

13

MR. ENNIS:

Are those judgments before us?
Pardon me, Your Honor?

The lower court judgments?
No, they are not directly before the

Court.
QUESTION:

Doesn't that solve the problem?

We can

only pass on one.

14

MR. ENNIS:

15

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I think -And the one that we have before us,

16

would you agree that the court went out of its way to point

17

out that they were ruling on federal and not state grounds?

18

MR. ENNIS:

19

QUESTION:

20

21

It is certainly true.
And if that's true, why send it back and

say, is that what you were doing?
MR. ENNIS:

Well, let me say this, Your Honor.

Even

22

if there would be no jurisdictional bar to this Court enter­

23

taining the case, as I think there is, there is a very strong

24

policy reason under Ashwand'er for this Court not to grant

25

cert, in the circumstances of this case, because it may not
63

1

be necessary to resolve these very difficult and important

2

federal constitutional questions in order for the same judg­

3

ment to stand on state law grounds.

4

I think it is at least appropriate to vacate and remand to

5

the state court for clarification.

6

In those circumstances

In that connection, let me point out something

7

that is not mentioned in my amicus brief, and that is that

8

Michigan has since 1919 adopted its own state exclusionary

9

rule, Immediately after Weeks, and in People v. Beavers --

10

decided 393 Michigan 554 -- the Michigan Supreme Court ruled

11

that they will apply their state exclusionary rule even in

12

circumstances where the Fourth Amendment and the federal

13

exclusionary rule

14

do not require exclusion of the evidence.

QUESTION:

But the Supreme Court of Michigan didn't

15

do that here.

16

years ago, which came up in the Supreme Court of Ohio, we

17

said that there may be adequate state grounds for it, but

18

the Ohio Court placed it on federal grounds, and we will de­

19

cide the federal question so that the state court will feel

20

free to decide it under state law, knowing there is no federal,

21

impediment.

22

And in Zucchini, which we decided two or three

MR. ENNIS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I think

23

that's slightly different in that the question there is whe­

24

ther the state court acted under what it believed to be the

25

compulsion of overriding federal law.
64

That is not the case

1

here.

In fact, the case law in Michigan, if you will look

2

into it, indicates that the Michigan courts apply under their

3

own Fourth Amendment principles, give more protection to

4

defendants than would probably be required by the Fourth

5

Amendment, and they also apply a state exclusionary rule

6

that excludes evidence that would not have to be excluded

7

under the federal exclusionary rule.

8

under compulsion of federal law by being more protective of

9

individual rights.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ENNIS:

They are not acting

But why didn't they do it here?
Your Honor, I don't know, and that's

12

why I think, given the two lower court decisions so that it's

13

not just speculative possibility that it could be done, it

14

would certainly be consistent with Ashwander for this Court

15

to vacate and remand for clarification.

16

QUESTION:

Where does this suggestion of yours

17

stop?

18

tively on a federal ground,' what are we to do?

19

send back to a state court and say, now, look, maybe you

20

could have rested this on a state ground and until you tell

21

us you can't we're not going to deal with the federal questioiji?

22

Does it go that far?

23

MR. ENNIS:

Every time there's a decision rested, rested affirma­

I believe this case is unique, so far as I've been

able to determine.
QUESTION:

But as Justice Marshall suggested to

12

you, is not the fact that two lower state courts decided on

13

other grounds make it more apparent that the Supreme Court of

14

Michigan went out of its way to put it on federal grounds and

15

to reject the state grounds?

16

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, I don't know.

It may be

17

that the Michigan Supreme Court decided simply to discuss

18

these questions in chronological order, and the first issue

19

that comes up is the legality of the detention.

20

that was the sole basis of why they addressed the detention

21

issue rather than the subsequent state law issues that were

22

found dispositive in the lower courts.

23

cumstances a remand would be appropriate.

sent to the IRA in Ireland, and they send a team of seven or

4

eight officers out, adequately prepared for that.

5

you think they may not detain the man at the door?
MR. ENNIS:

6

Suppose a warrant were to search

Then do

Well, Your Honor, I believe that the

7

answer to that question can probably be resolved under

8

existing law, under Terry v. Ohio.

9

aware, Your Honor, Terry does permit a pat-down for weapons

10

in circumstances where the police have reasonable suspicion

11

to believe that a person might be armed and dangerous, even

12

if they do not have probable cause to detain for a lengthy

13

period of time or to arrest.

14

that the Michigan Supreme Court did not even consider whether

15

Terry, existing law, would have authorized that kind of a

16

search or the search involved in this case, because it went

17

off on the quite different ground, under Dunaway, that there

18

could be no detention whatsoever.

19

tional reason why cert, should be dismissed as improvidently

20

granted,

21

that particular question, the scope of Terry in the circum­

22

stances of this case, has never been considered by the

23

Michigan Supreme Court.

The interesting point here is

That, I think, is an addi­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN, ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

3

MR. BAUGHMAN:

If it please the Court, I'd just

4

like to take a moment to again emphasize the distinction in

5

our ground on the detention issue.

6

We see this, as I said, as a warrants case.

We be­

7

lieve that respondent, that persons on the premises or de­

8

parting from the premises where a warrant is going to be

9

executed may be detained while the warrant is executed re­

10

gardless of any individualized, particularized, Terry-type

11

suspicion that that person is engaged in criminal activity.

12

There may have been such a suspicion as to Mr. Summers.

13

There probably was not such a suspicion as to the other six

14

people in the house other than Mr. Calhoun.

15

they could all be detained under the authority of the warrant.

authorize any search or seizure of any person, George or
