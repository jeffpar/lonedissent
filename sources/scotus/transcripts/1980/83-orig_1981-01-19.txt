Thank you very much.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

The Court will hear

This original action challenges the validity of
Louisiana's first use tax on natural gas-, and its companion
measure

comes to the Court on exceptions to two reports of

the Special Master.

In his report of May 14, 1980, the

Special Master recommended among other things, that the Court
grant the motions to intervene of the United States, of the
17 pipeline companies, and of the State of New Jersey.

In

his report of September 15, 1980, he recommended denial of
Louisiana's motion to dismiss and denial of the 8 Plaintiff
States' motion for judgment on the pleadings.

With the Court' s

permission, I would like to discuss the operation of the
statutory scheme with particular emphasis on its facial and
intended discrimination against interstate commerce; next,
the Solicitor General will speak to the scheme's interference
with the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 5

and finally, Mr. Peragine, on behalf of the Pipelines, will
speak to their motion to intervene, as well as to certain
commerce clause issues.
May it please the Court, this Court some 30 years

ago, in Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, recognized that a state

quote the Court, "artlessly disclosed an avowed purpose to
discriminate against interstate commerce".

This , we respect­

fully suggest to the Court is such a case, and it falls even
more squarely within this Court's recent precedent, of Boston
Stock Exchange v. The New York Tay Commission, and the City
of Philadelphia v. New Jersey.

Because, Your Honors, nothing

emerges more clearly from the 115 pages of legislative
history which you have before you, and
scheme itself, than

from the statutory

the compulsive concern of Louisiana to

export this tax.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHS:
QUESTION:

General Sachs?
Yes sir?
Before you get to the so-called merits

of the case, is it your opinion that Illinois v. Milwaukee
completely overruled Ohio v. Wyandotte?
MR. SACHS:

No, Your Honor, it is not our opinion

that Illinois v. The City of Milwaukee overrules Ohio v.
Wyandotte, nor is it our opinion that this case is controlled
by this Court's disposition of the application for original
5

1

jurisdiction of Arizona v. New Mexico.

2

Honor, were not exclusive, within the exclusive jurisdiction

3

of this Court.

4

were cases within the original jurisdiction, but not con­

5

trolled by Section 1251 of the Judiciary Act, which gives

6

this Court exclusive jurisdiction.

Those cases, Your

Both the Illinois case and the Ohio case

7

Furthermore, may I say, Your Honor, that this case

8

is far from the kind of case that impacts common law notions

9

of nuisance as involved in one of those cases; it's far from

10

the kind of case that impacts scientific testimony and scien­

11

tific evidence that would have been required as Mr. Justice

12

Harlan, I think, said in the Ohio case, and Mr. Justice

13

Douglas, perhaps, in the Illinois case.

14

impacts 30 states of this union and which tests whether or

15

not one state at a time of energy crisis can, in what we

16

claim to be flagrant violation of the original principles

17

of the commerce clause can impose

18

And so, Your Honor, for both jurisdictional reasons as well

19

as prudential reasons, we think this case is radically dif­

20
21

22

24
25

This is a case which

its will on other states.

ferent from both the Ohio case and the Illinois case.
And may I also add, Your Honor, if I may, that in
Arizona v. New Mexico, there is not the slightest suggestion
that we can find that the suggestion of whether or not the
states can get an alternative hearing in some other form, is
in any way overruled.

And it's worth pointing out, I think,

There is no

MR. SACHS:

We are here in both capacities, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHS:
in both capacities.

I realize that.
And we -- and I make the same assertion
We are here very much like Pennsylvania

was here some 50 years ago in its suit against West Virginia,
in which very similar contentions were being made when one
state thereby, by simply cutting off supply, was having
impact on the state and its citizens .
QUESTION:

Well, but do you disagree with the notion

that there is some tension between Pennsylvania v. West
Virginia and Ohio v. Wyandotte?
MR. SACHS:

No, Your Honor, I do not.

And the

reason -- that is, I do disagree with the contention that
there is tension between the two propositions, for the reasons
that I began to indicate perhaps a moment or two ago.

We

are dealing here, as this Court did in Pennsylvania v. West
Virginia, with a case that probes deep into the nature of

say that here, two centuries

are asking this Court to face, precisely the questions of
sectionalism, precisely the questions of the ability of one
state to profiteer from its position, in this case, as a
-- thwart a supply of a very important natural resource.
Those concerns, Your Honor, while I don't mean to
denigrate the issues of nuisance, or the issues of pollution,
or the issues that vexed the states of Illinois and Ohio in
the two cases that we've been discussing -- while I don't mear
to denigrate those, we respectfully suggest, Your Honor, that
here we are dealing with something terribly different.

This

tax brings into the state of Louisiana three hundred million
-- let me be conservative, $250 million a year.

And Louisians

statutory structure would give us, if we are successful, if
we could get to their courts and if we could sue in their
courts, they would give us six percent on our money.

They

are the kinds of reasons, Your Honor.

I don't blush

QUESTION:

Yet ordinarily, a litigant suing on

the basis that the tax violated the commerce clause' >or for
some other reason was deficient constitutionally, would have
his case reviewed in the district court, the Court of Appeals,

23

and if it is as important as you say it is, in this Court by
24

writ of certiorari or perhaps , one of the few remaining direct
25

appeals.

Here, you have a Special Master and it goes directly
8

1

to this Court.

2

think the prudential considerations mentioned in Wyandotte

3

might be all the more important, in that you would get a

4

more exhaustive review of your contentions in the ordinary lit-

5

igative

6

tion type of action.

7

MR. SACHS:

Given the importance of the case, I would

process,

than you would in the original jurisdic­

I have two responses to that, Mr.

8

Justice Rehnquist.

9

that suggests that exhaustive is good; we don't believe we

Court found in Boston Stock Exchange, as it found in Phila­

offensive to the Commerce clause and as Mr. Smith will

argue, to the supremacy clause.

QUESTION:

We believe that, just as this

Exhaustion is not needed

Well I don't mean exhaustion in the sense

17

of exhaustion of remedies, but I mean review by several dif­

18

ferent courts.

19

MR. SACHS:

Nor, with all respect, Your Honor, do

20

we believe that review by several different courts is essential

21

to determine the claim here.

22

we are not a litigant as appears in most of the courts of

23

this country.

25

the Constitution, for it to be heard precisely because there

or to be heard elsewhere, would not do justice as between

the parties.

4

constitutional prescription, we are here in the exclusive

5

jurisdiction because we're within the statutory prescription,

6

and we are here -- as far as, I can argue to Your Honor, with

7

on the right/side of all of the prudential concerns, serious

8

indignity of the claim is one of the pieces of language that

9

comes, I think, from Mr. Justice Douglas' opinion for this

11

to be heard in the forum of a foreign state

And so we are here because we are within the

Court in the Illinois case.
It's hard for me to imagine, I say, as an advocate

12

certainly, but I say as a lawyer, it is hard for me to

13

imagine a more serious and a more dignified claim to engage

14

the constitutional attention of this Court than this claim

15

which harks back to the very primal concerns which were

16

present when the Constitution was written.

17

need in our respectful judgment, Your Honor, review by other

18

courts, it doesn't need fact finding by any Special Master;

19

what it needs is the judgment on the pleadings that we have

20

sought and that we earnestly press on this Court's attention.

QUESTION:

And so it doesn't

Philadelphia v. New Jersey, of course,

And in Boston

dwell on Boston Stock Exchange for a moment, if T may.

-- that case is very much like this one.

4

it was decided on the pleadings; there like here, the legis­

5

6

White in his opinion for a unanimous Court suggested --

which betrayed a purpose to protect the in-state commercial

Well, it is the merits, but it's the

merits of the narrow but fundamental question as to whether

19

this statute facially discriminates and intends to discrim­

inate against interstate commerce.

21

you can't read the 115 pages -- that's all there are, 115

22

pages which are Exhibit C to the last -- filing on behalf

23

of the States -- you can't read that and the 10 or 12 pages

24

of the statute without seeing and realizing that what the

25

Louisiana legislature wanted to do -- and this is not
11

Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

1

hyperbole on my part, it is theirs -- what it wanted to do

2

was to make up for its frustration for years, much of which

3

has been recorded in the annals of this Court, at its inabil­

4

ity to profit from the rich deposits of natural gas on the

5

Outer Continental Shelf in the federal domain.

6

effort to do that, what it determined to do was to impose a

7

so-called first use tax on the first time this gas comes into

8

the state.

here in any case.

That may have been bad enough.

And in an

exempted every conceivable local incidence of the tax; the

1 1

local domestic producers were exempted, local utility users

12

were exempted, local commercial interests which would other­

13

wise take from the tax were exempted.

14

one of them said, if this tax is going to be passed it's

15

going to be a passed-on tax, no doubt about it.

16

history that you'll see when you read the legislative history

17

was how that legislature was going to confront the problem

18

of getting the benefits of the tax without having the local

folks bear the burden.

QUESTION:

And what they did, as

And the

Could Maryland itself have gone into

21

a United States District Court in Louisiana, and made this

22

same claim?

23

MR. SACHS:

No, Your Honor, for two reasons.

The

24

first is, because it is our belief, and we think the cases

25

are ample,

Illinois v. City of Milwaukee indirectly says
12

1

it, we're in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme

2

Court.

3

Louisiana or its official officials, and get that kind of

4

relief.

5

lest I be misunderstood, we, because we were not the tax­

6

payers -- that is not the same thing as saying we do not have

7

standing here in this Court -- but that because we were not

8

literally the taxpayers in Louisiana, we could not have

engaged in the refund proceedings which only the pipeline

We cannot go into the courts of Louisiana to sue

But secondly, and let me say all of this at once

10

companies could have engaged.

1 1

QUESTION:

Who support you in this case.

12

MR. SACHS:

They do indeed support us.

They came,

13

they asked to intervene, and their position and ours are

14

certainly similar on the merits.

15

who have reviewed these matters, Professor Hellerstein among

16

them, have indicated the facial unconstitutionality of this

17

Louisiana tax.

18

Ours and many commentators

I'd like to address, if I may, what we think --

19

the only thing that we believe troubled the Special Master

20

on this aspect of the case, namely the facial unconstitution­

21

ality as far as discrimination against interestate commerce

22

is concerned.

23

say -- he almost did it, you can't read his opinion without

24

feeling that another inch or two and perhaps we would have

25

been there.

What Mr. Davis, the Special Master, did was to

But he didn't do it, and on this aspect of the
13

1

case he didn't, because he was concerned that perhaps the

2

actuality of operation of the tax would disclose that it had

3

a bona fide compensating tax, kind of a justification.

4

with all respect to the Special Master, we think he mis­

5

conceived two things.

6

And

First of all, the whole notion of actuality of

7

operation.

8

opinion in Halliburton.

9

be said to be a call to trial.

The phrase of course, comes from this Court's
But in no way, shape or form can it
What actuality of operation

10

meant there and what it meant in the seminal case of Henne-

11

ford, the Cardozo opinion of many years ago, saying that a

12

sales tax and a use tax can indeed be compensating was

13

simply that you look at the way these statutes operate.

14

was not a statement that you need evidence, it was not a

15

statement that you have to have a trial, it was a question

16

of looking at the entire statutory scheme.

17

repeat, a call to trial.

18

It

It was not, I

Indeed, in Henneford itself, the opinion of Mr.

19

Justice Cardozo that liberated us from some of the past --

20

what was an earlier avoidance of taxation by semantics, may

21

I say -- what Cardozo did in Henneford was to decide a case

22

with, there is no evidence, it is basically a facial judgment

23

he made in the Henneford opinion, which makes super clear

24

to us that actuality of operation is not necessarily a call

25

to trial.
14

1

And then the second thing that the Special Master,

2

we think, misperceived, was that there is a very, very sig­

3

nificant difference between the sales tax/use tax/compensating

4

tax analysis,

5

What is being claimed here is compensating in the sense of

6

we don't like the fact that we can't tax OCS gas, and we want

7

to do better.

8

they said we don't like the fact that the regional stock

9

exchanges are out hustling us or out advertising us, or

and the kind of compensation claimed here.

It’s much like -- in Boston Stock Exchange,

10

drawing business away from us, in that sense, one can say that

11

the New York statute was compensating.

12

unanimously said, that's not what compensating means for'

13

purposes of tax analysis.

14

Justice Cardozo said in the Henneford case, in the famous

15

metaphor there,, is that the dweller from within and the

16

stranger from afar have to be treated even handedly. Even-

17

handedness, he said, is the

18

the statutes.

19

that when you examine this statute and the legislative

20

history, you will see that it makes a mockery of the notion

21

of even-handedness, what they did here.

22

every step of the way -- read, if you read no other page,

23

Your Honor, read page 82(c) of the legislative history as

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
16

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

1

2
3
4

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think it can be stated with assurance on an

5

examination of the Special Master's report and on the statute

6

that this, Louisiana's first use tax on natural gas is aimed

7

at what is called OCS gas, or Outer Continental Shelf gas.

8

It essentially exempts all gas for which a severance tax is

9

paid, either in any other state or in Louisiana.

It also is

10

aimed in part on federal enclave gas; that is, the gas that

11

is extracted from federal -- enclaves owned by the federal

12

government.

13

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has, as

14

the Court has said in numerous opinions, exclusive juris­

15

diction over the sale and -- rate making over the sale or

16

transportation of gas moving in interstate commerce.

17

can be no doubt that this gas is moving in interstate commerce.

18

From the well head to the burner tips, the cases are legion

19

that that movement is interstate commerce.

20

Regulatory Commission objects principally to Section 47:1303(c),

21

which is set forth in full at page 6 of our brief; that is,

22

the last brief we filed, styled Exception of the United States.

23

And that provision states any agreement or contract by which

24

an owner of natural gas, at a time a taxable use first occurs

25

claims a right to

reimbursement or refund of such taxes from
17

1

any other party in interest other than a purchaser of such

2

atural gas, is hereby declared to be against public policy

3

and unenforceable to that extent.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, if we accepted either your

5

argument or that of General Sachs, this Louisiana tax would

6

be invalid, would it not?

7

MR. SMITH:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

8

QUESTION:

It wouldn't be necessary to accept both

of them at all?

No, as a matter of fact, it wouldn't be

constitutional argument, insofar as it relies on the supremacy
clause?
MR. SMITH:

Right.

If the Court accepts that argu­

ment, the entire statute falls and the Court need not reach
any other argument.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, FERC would have had no diffi­

culty in suing Louisiana in a federal district court in
Louisiana, would it?
18

1

MR. SMITH:

FERC would have had no difficulty

2

suing Louisiana, and in fact, there is a suit which has been

3

brought in the Middle District of Louisiana, but the states

4

cannot be parties to that suit as General Sachs has pointed

5

out, so the prudential considerations indicate that the states

6

cannot be heard in that suit.

7

Secondly, that suit, the District Court in that

8

suit, has abstained from deciding the matter and indefinitely

9

postponed it, pending a resolution of the suits brought by

10

Louisiana officials in the Louisiana court.

1 1

court has indefinitely postponed consideration of its suit to

which the states cannot be parties as well, pending a resolu­

13

tion, you know, disposition by this Court, of the matter.

16

QUESTION:

And the Louisiana

Well so that all that revolves around

our original jurisdiction in here, does it not?
MR. SMITH:

It does, it does.

I think that the

17

point simply is that those -- both of those forums are inappro­

18

priate forums for the resolution of what we think are these

19

major constitutional questions because 1) the states cannot

20

be heard in those suits, secondly -- in fact, Louisiana in

21

the state action recently sought to move things along, or to

22

give the appearance of moving things along by seeking a rule

to have the states

And the state

So you know, those suits are offtrack, and

The only --

3

QUESTION:

But the only reason they're offtrack

is because of this original action.
MR. SMITH:

I don't think so, Mr. Justice.

I think

4

the reason they're offtrack -- well, let me point out one

5

other thing with respect to the state suits which we pointed

6

out in our brief amicus in support of the complaint about

7

a year and a half ago in this Court, and that is that the

8

-- that that state suit is a declaratory action, by state

9

officials against the pipelines, and producers, and it more

10

or less asks the Court to hold the tax valid in anticipation

11

of possible challenges of invalidity.

12

Court that that is probably not an Article III case or contro­

13

versy since it asks that Louisiana court for an advisory

14

opinion about a tax in anticipation of the challenge that,

15

you know, in other court that hasn't occurred yet.

20

QUESTION:

I would suggest to the

Mr. Smith, you say that these other

courts are "inappropriate".

Don't you need

a better word

t han inappropriate?
MR. SMITH:

I really, I suspect that they are

really not capable of the kind of constitutional resolution --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SMITH:

No.

And I think that the prudential

23

consideration that dictated the Court deferring, or dismiss­

24

ing -- or denying the motion for a bill for leave to file a

25

complaint in Arizona v. New Mexico, simply don't apply here,
20

1

because there the New Mexico suits were capable of the kind

2

of resolution -- in fact, the Special Master in his report

3

of May 14th, in this case, pointed out that me -- one of

4

the utility companies in the Arizona v. New Mexico case,

5

was in privity with Arizona because it was a political sub­

6

division of Arizona.

7

in the New Mexico court.

8

cannot be heard.

9

think that anybody really could take serious dispute of that,

10

that's why we think that the prudential considerations really

1 1

speak in favor of the Court's original -- employment of the

12

original jurisdiction, in this context, because of the fact

13

that the cases in which the Court has declined are really

14

distinguishable.

15

So essentially a state could be heard
And here, here the sovereign states

And that seems to be plain, and I don't

QUESTION:

Well the solar power district in Arizona

16

is in privity with the state of Arizona only in the sense

17

that there's an enabling statute alive to be formed.

18

MR. SMITH:

Yes, but that makes a big difference.

19

Essentially the Court said in its per curiam opinion that

20

the solar power company was a political subdivision of

21

Arizona.

22

had a mechanism by which it could be heard in the New Mexico

23

Courts.

24

states involved in this case really don't have that, they

25

don't have that opportunity.

That means essentially that the State of Arizona

4

that very purpose of giving the state an absolutely objective

forum for the resolution of what are very complicated and

touchy constitutional questions that really go to the heart

7

of really the federal system, I think.

11

is really an exclusive one, and for the State of

Would you say the same thing if the State

of Maryland itself was not a direct purchaser of Louisiana
gas?

If it’s simply suing parens patriae?
MR. SMITH:

Well I think I would say the same thing,

12

but of course I don't have to say that here because it's --

13

much, we have a much -- the State of Maryland has a much

14

stronger case because it is a consumer of natural gas in the

15

same way that the federal government is.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SMITH:

Granted.

But I was asking you --

I think that the parens patriae thing

18

is compelling in the sense that, you know, you've got a

19

bunch of consumers, you know, who basically on the basis of

20

this tax which is really, you know, for want of a better

21

expression, exploited, you know, fiscal greed, are going to

22

have to pay higher utility bills and the chances of people

23

like that bringing a suit to complain in the proper forum are

24

really remote.

25

in that kind of capacity, it seems to me, is in the best

And for the state to act as parens patriae

22

traditions of the parens patriae jurisdiction.

2

QUESTION:

Well where is the limitation, then?

3

Isn't the state capable of acting as parens patriae in almost

4

any suit that any of its citizens are affected by?

5

MR. SMITH:

I suppose that's so.

But you know

6

here, where the fiscal states are so large and where Maryland

7

also is suing in its capacity as consumer, I don't think

8

that, you know, the Court need wrestle with those difficult

9

questions of what would happen if the state was only here

10

as parens patriae.

1 1

I think I would like to talk in my remaining time,

12

about the complaint of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis­

13

sion here.

14

language I read, essentially prohibits a pass-back of the

15

tax to the producer.

16

And that is essentially Section 1303(c) the

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you just for a moment,

17

Mr. Smith, to ask if each of the eight plaintiff states is

18

itself a consumer of gas?

19

MR. SMITH:

I think that's correct, and I think

20

that's alleged in the complaint, and I don't think there's

21

any dispute about that.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SMITH:

All right.
Now what that means, essentially, by

24

prohibiting the pass-back, Louisiana has responded to the onl^

25

articles of concern here, that- the producers would complain

alike?

because that function is a judgment for the Commission to

MR. PERAGINE:

Because, Your Honor, if you look

12

at processing -- first of all, it is an integral part of the

13

interstate transmission of this gas which began offshore at

the well head.

15

so integral with the interstate transmission of that gas,

that it's necessarily a

QUESTION:

Well, why shouldn't that part of the

3

MR. PERAGINE:

Well because, I may say this, Your

4

Honor, the processing is traditionally done by the producers

5

who own the liquids and liquefiables, and they want to get

6

those liquids and liquefiables out of the gas, so they attempt

7

to do that.

8

QUESTION:

MR. PERAGINE:

Where do they do that?

which do that.

In plants, they have plants?

it's imposed on the natural gas -- and coming into that plant

MR. PERAGINE:

rate of tax for every unit of processing, of gas that was

processed, whether you speak in trillions or billions or

millions, or whatever it is; why couldn't the state do that?

10
11

MR. PERAGINE:

I don't know that the state could

not do that, to put a tax on the processing of gas, Your Honor1.

12

14

and if that was a tax on processing itself, I don't know that

Yes, it is, for processing--

But you concede that it -- that that

kind of a tax might be, nevertheless, valid?
MR. PERAGINE:

But you're talking about -- the

effect of this tax is that it's transported beyond Louisiana's
border, sir, because the only -QUESTION:

Now you're changing the case again.

I want to put aside this requirement that they pass it on.
34

1

Couldn't Louisiana collect a tax on processing, even though

2

that processing was of gas that was in the course of being

3

transmitted out of the state?

4

MR. PERAGINE:

Well I think -- I suppose the answer

5

to that, Justice White, is that the Court would have to --

6

would have to hold that the interstate commerce does not

7

begin until the processing has been completed.

8
9

QUESTION:

Why, why?

Why is that?

Interstate

commerce pays its way?

10

MR. PERAGINE:

Interstate commerce pays its way,

11

Your Honor, but I don't believe that it has to -- that it

12

must be -- well, let me get off that.

13

It is levied only as to OCS gas, this particular

14

And even though it is processed, it is still that

15

natural gas that comes through that plant; in practical

16

effect, it falls only on the pipeline companies who transport

17

the gas through and beyond Louisiana.

18

QUESTION:

Well why

do

the states have any

19

standing to object to it, if in practical effect it falls

20

only on the pipeline?

21

MR. PERAGINE:

Well because if it passes on the

22

MR. GRESSMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may

the case

in Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Company and more particularly,

14

Arizona v. New Mexico.

But the primary

is the prudential declination standard expressed

Now, Mr. Sachs has indicated that the Ohio v.

16

Wyandotte principle, whereby this Court may in its discretion

17

decline to exercise a ease that is otherwise within the

18

original jurisdiction of this Court, where there is an alter­

19

native forum in which the identical issues can be brought,

20

should somehow not apply.in that branch of this Court's

21

original jurisdiction between two or more states.

22

Ohio v. Wyandotte was a suit under the other branch of this

23

Court's original but concurrent jurisdiction, as between a

state and citizens of another state.

I asked whether there was a case or

MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, there does, in terms of invok­

ing this Court's original jurisdiction.

8

Now, what the real controversy here is all about,

9

and it's very simple; this is a suit involving a controversy

10

over the tax refund claims of the private pipeline taxpayers

11

and the State of Louisiana.

12

that the states, the Plaintiff states have sought to volunteer

13

to adjudicate and secure relief

MR. GRESSMAN:

But that is a pro­

prietary interest, Your Honor.

4

and that brings us right back to the proposition that was

5

stated as recently -- in Pennsylvania v. New Jersey -- that

6

it has become settled doctrine that a state has standing to

7

sue only when its sovereign or quasi-sovereign interests are

8

implicated, and it is not merely litigating as a volunteer

9
10

And this Court has so declared,

the personal claims of its citizens.
QUESTION:

Well, it's litigating its own claims,

1 1

in part at least; it's litigating its claims, because it uses

12

gas and is paying more than it should for its gas.

13

MR. GRESSMAN:

Yes, but the interest that it is

14

asserting there, that is the cost, the burden of the tax that

15

has somehow been passed on by reason of some authority other

16

than the State of Louisiana -- the State of Louisiana has not

17

insisted, in its tax statute that this tax be passed on, this

18

tax could have been absorbed by the taxpayers.

19

have been passed on to some other entity, but with the appro­

20

val and authority of the federal energy authorities, it has

21

been passed on to the consumer.

22

Now, the fact is that the State

Or it could

of Maryland and

23

the other states , have only the common interest that every

24

consumer has when he purchases a product .

25

In other words,

the interest that the State of Maryland asserts here is -40

1

as a consumer of gas, is no different, is no more sovereign

2

in its characteristics than the interest of the Maryland

3

housewife who purchases gas from the same pipeline operations.

4

In fact, they are suing precisely on behalf of all the gas

5

consumers, personal gas consumers in the State of Maryland.

6

Now, I suggest that that does not -- that standing has a

7

-- as a proposition of invoking the very serious jurisdiction

8

of this Court, under Article III, over controversies between

9

two or more states, simply does not encompass a controversy

10

where no sovereign interest of the state, of the Plaintiff

1 1

state, are involved in the litigation.
QUESTION:

12

And it is --

Mr. Gressman, I have an awful problem

13

with saying that money is not an interest of a sovereign.

14

I mean a sovereign can’t operate very well without money,

15

can it?

16

MR. GRESSMAN:

17

QUESTION:

Of course not, Your Honor.

So it is a part.

And when they use that

MR. GRESSMAN:

Because the state is involved.
Well, the state --

The state's money is involved.

The

State's lifeblood is involved, you could use a whole lot of

7

beautiful phrases.
MR. GRESSMAN:

8
9

Well, I understand exactly what

you're saying, Justice Marshall.

The point, however, is that

10

that money, that injury or burden, as you will, has never

1 1

been elevated so far as I know into any kind of a cause of

12

action.

13

cause of action for bringing suit against some other state

14

who happens to have imposed a tax upon a taxpayer or a manu­

15

facturer of a product --

A consumer simply does not have any recognizable

16

QUESTION:

Which is being passed on to him.

MR. GRESSMAN:

-- which then the manufacturer, by

18

economic forces or otherwise, passes on to the consumer.

20

literally composed of hundreds if not thousands of hidden

21

taxes that have been passed on to us as consumers.

22

open the door of the judiciary to suits brought by consumers

23

with no greater interest than that, I think, would bring

24

chaos upon the federal court system.

25

chaotic to open the doors of this Court's original jurisdictio n
42

We

And to

And it would be doubly

1

over suits between states simply because a state which pur­

2

chases hundreds of thousands of products in the course of

3

its operations, happens to find a hidden tax, so-called, in

4

one of the products that it purchases for its use in heating

5

the state capitol building, and therefore can bring a suit

6

before this Court challenging the constitutionality

7

taxing state's statute.

8
9

of the

This is precisely the kind of controversy that
this Court said, in Ohio v. Wyandotte, should not be involved

10

in the original docket of this Court.

11

pointing out that -- some of the prudential factors that

12

underlie the principle of declination expressed in Wyandotte,

13

pointed as a prime example the innumerable suits that exist

14

in this country, innumerable controversies let me say, betweer

15

private citizens and a taxing authority.

16

the door of this Court's original jurisdiction to the -- any

17

state acting solely as a consumer to come before you and

18

assault and adjudicate the constitutionality of a state

19

statute of a sister state, a state tax statute of a sister

20

state, I suggest that this would be disruptive of this Court's

21

valuable time and energies which, as Justice Harlan so well

22

pointed out, are as a matter of national policy

23

policy much better devoted to cases on its appellate docket.

24
25

QUESTION:

Justice Harlan, in

And if you open

and judicial

Hr. Gressman, it is true is it not, that

there are more federal interests in this particular
43

1

controversy than in most of the cases that you're describing,

2

because of the source of the gas and the special federal

3

statutes and all?

4

HR. GRESSMAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. GRESSMAN:

Of course.

There are.

It's sort of a unique case.
There are.

But perhaps an answer,

7

that can be given to all those interests lies in the various

8

causes of action that are pending and available in other

9

courts.

It is significant that there is a tax refund suit

10

in the state of Louisiana brought by the taxpayers, the

11

pipeline companies.

12

in the federal court in Louisiana brought by the federal

13

authorities where they can assert all the federal interests

14

that they claim are at issue here.

15

plethora of suits brought by -- both by the State of Louisiana

16

and more particularly, by the various pipeline companies and

17

tax paying interests in Louisiana.

18

QUESTION:

It is significant that there is a suit

Indeed, there is a

Mr. Gressman, when would you predict that

19

the issue would be finally resolved if the alternative route

20

is taken, rather than a ruling on the motion for summary

21

judgment; assuming that the judgment on the pleadings -- motio n

22

for judgment on the pleadings has merit?

23

MR. GRESSMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well --

There's quite a difference in time and

in interest and -44

HR. GRESSMAN:

1

Yes, of course, that involves a host

2

of other considerations as to whether this case could ever be

3

disposed of on the basis of the pleadings, without any kind

4

of an evidentiary hearing.
QUESTION:

5

But the point is --

I'm just making that assumption for

6

purposes of comparing the relative value of the two different

7

procedures.
MR. GRESSMAN:

8
9

Right.

Well, in comparing the value

of the two forum -- or sets of forums that are available,

10

let me say there is no comparison.

I think every consideration,

11

every prudential, every judicial, every wise principle of

12

judicial administration would suggest that -- there's far

13

greater chances of securing a meaningful kind of adjudication

14

of these constitutional issues in the state courts or in the

15

federal courts, in Louisiana.

16

QUESTION:

Didn't it take approximately 20 years

17

for the State of Arizona, for the case of Arizona v. Californi a

18

to be finally decided?
MR. GRESSMAN:

Yes, there are cases on this original

docket where you have to involve yourself in evidentiary

Well that's true.

But that suggests

another proposition; it may be so brief as to be untrustworthy,

3

as a method of serious constitutional adjudication, determining

4

the validity of the state tax on the basis of the pleadings -QUESTION:

Well just take one example, if Mr.

6

Smith's argument is valid, what do you need all the evidence

for?

I mean, I don't know, maybe it isn't valid, maybe

MR. GRESSMAN:

6

Nov;, the consideration, the vital consideration in

7

determining when that Ohio v. Wyandotte principle applies

8

is the pendency of some kind of state court action that

9

provides an appropriate forum in which the issues tendered

10

here may be litigated.

1 1

New Mexico, the emphasis is on the identity of the issues,

authority for what I deem to be the appropriate

13

Missouri said that it would see that Massachusetts should be

14

able to bring a suit against the trustees for collection of

15

its taxes in either a Missouri state court or in a federal

16

district court in Missouri, and that such a suit would in

17

Missouri constitute a case of controversy.

18

So too, I think

the State of Louisiana, will not oppose any effort by the

19

State of Maryland to present its interest in some manner

20

before the pending litigation.

Mr. Pugh, what do you think the major

So the Louisiana court can interpret

Your Honor.

I hope not.

MR. PUGH:

I only suggest, Your Honor -- I would

not do that, Your Honor, I only suggest, that to interpret
one requires necessarily an appreciation of another.

I don’t

think they just hang these two statutes up, Your Honor, and
say :thisIlooks good, that looks bad or this looks good and
that looks bad.

We must have an underlying interpretation

of the constitutional facts that are applicable to that sta­
tute, whether or not it's the processing plant, whether or
not it's transportation, whether it's not -- it’s any one
of these other uses, including sale.

And the only thing we

ask this Court to do is to give us an opportunity to resolve

MR. SACKS:

there was something unusual about the fact that the Fifth

QUESTION:

Mr. Sachs, supposing that the Attorney-

7

General of Maryland became convinced that a number of Marylanc

8

residents who had moved- or retired to Louisiana, were being

9

unconstitutionally taxed by Louisiana in the state tax pro­

10

ceeding, could it bring an original action against Louisiana

11

as parens patriae in this Courtclaiming that the

12

Louisiana statute was unconstitutional?

13

MR. SACHS:

Oh, I think probably not, Mr. Justice

14

Rehnquist, because for the very reason that this case, for

15

example, in Pennsylvania v.

16

General Sachs, every commodity that the

MR. SACHS:

Indeed they are, Mr. Justice Stewart.

12

QUESTION:

And as you, does the.state as the pur­

13

chaser of each of those commodities, require standing to

14

attack the tax?

15

MR. SACHS:

No sir, but the distinction here is that

16

the unconstitutional event in the first place, as the

17

lative history will show you, is that Louisiana.imposed this

18

tax taking advantage of a mechanism, a conduit through

the pipelines, a FERC mechanism, all of which happened exactly

as they forecasted, precisely so that the tax would be borne

And included in that test is whether or not the

or not it is apportioned, et cetera.

14

the case, we are saying, much like Boston Stock Exchange and

it is possible to say that facially this statute does those

White, in a universe that says Louisiana can find some tax

that is not offensive to interstate commerce, and it can

impose it on a thing called processing.

21

now I get back to what you raised earlier, Mr. Justice Stevens,

and that is, it really doesn't matter in this case, and we have
