ORAL ARGUMENT OF GILL DEFORD, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DEFORD:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

The issue of this case is the disparate treatment

11

of a discrete class of Medicaid recipients by the State of

12

California.

13

federal Medicaid system guarantees that it will be reimbursed

14

50 percent of its cost by the Federal Government.

15

at the same time California is obligated to comply with con­

16

trolling federal law.

17
18

California's decision to participate in the

QUESTION:

However,

How do you have your federal jurisdic­

tion here?

19

MR. DEFORD:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. DEFORD:

In the District Court?
Yes.
We had it— we alleged jurisdiction un­

22

der both 1331 and under 1343.

23

found jurisdiction under both of those grants.

24

Appeals decided not to look at 1343, but did find jurisdiction

25

under 1331.

The federal District Court
The Court of

Either of them are cause of actions 1983.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. DEFORD:

1331 requires $10,000?
At the time this case was brought it

3

did.

The federal District Court and the Court of Appeals

4

both found there was $10,000 in controversy.

5

course, the statute has been amended to eliminate the $10,000.
QUESTION:

6
7

It's in excess of

$10,000.

8

MR. DEFORD:

9

QUESTION:

10

Just nitpicking.

Since then, of

MR. DEFORD:

Yes.
Yes, but where did they find the $10,000';
For instance, the main plaintiff, Your

1 1

Honor, has bills to the nursing home in excess of $14,000

12

because of unpaid nursing home bills.

13
14
15
16

QUESTION:

In other words, what you're saying is

they found it prospectively?
MR. DEFORD:

At the time the case was brought she

would not have had bills in the amount of $10,000.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. DEFORD:

Therefore is there 1331 jurisdiction?
Well, since thd case was still going

19

on at the time .that'the statute was changed, I would think

20

that even if there was less than $10,000 in controversy when

21

it was brought, she would have had jurisdiction under 1331

22

in any event.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Do you think we should treat it as if

it had been filed after the amendment eliminated it?
MR. DEFORD:

I believe the amendment allowed for
4

1

jurisdiction in the federal district courts for any case then

2

pending.

3

tion in the District Court found under 1343, which does not

4

require an amount in controvery.

In any event, as I've said, there was also jurisdic­

QUESTION:

5

But then you run into a question, do you

6

not, as to whether this is a proper 1343 jurisdiction case

7

under the Houston Welfare Rights v. Chapman decision of this

8

Court?

9

MR. DEFORD:

That was what the 9th Circuit was

10

concerned about.

11

Court's decision of last summer In State of Maine v. Thiboutot

12

there is definitely

13

QUESTION:

14

However, Your Honor, I think under this

a

1983 cause of action.

Well, there is no doubt there's a 1983

cause of action but Thiboutot came from a state court --

15

MR. DEFORD:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Which is a court, presumably a court of

17

general jurisdiction.

18

the federal courts are of limited jurisdiction and Section

19

1343 is more limited, we held in Houston, than is 1983.

20

MR. DEFORD:

We affirmed the state court.

Here

Yes, Your Honor, but we did allege

21

both constitutional and statutory claims under 1983, and I

22

think under this Court's decision in Hagans v. Lavine,

23

Chapman did not alter the Hagans v. Lavine decision, so there

24

is pendent jurisdiction over the statutory claims which we

25

raised in the District Court and which are now before
5

1

this Court.

2

application of what is commonly known as a transfer of'assets or

3

divestment rule against one group of Medicaid recipients knpwr

4

as the medically needy while a corresponding group of Medicaid

5

recipients known as the categorically needy are not subject

6

to such a rule and as even California admits cannot be sub­

7

ject to such a rule under federal law.
QUESTION:

8
9

The specific concern here is with the state's

Now, what's the underlying policy purpose

behind that kind of a statute?

10

MR. DEFORD:

The transfer of assets statute?

My

11

assumption is, based on the briefs filed by the State of

12

California that the purpose is to avoid individuals who have

13

sufficient wealth to take care of themselves from forcing

14

themselves onto the public welfare rolls.
QUESTION:

15

That sort of pattern has permeated the

16

statutes

17

40 years ago, has it not?

MR. DEFORD:

19

QUESTION:

to the original welfare cases 30 or

I believe that's true; yes, sir.
Parents can't give their home or their

20

bank account or their stocks and bonds to their children and

21

then go on relief or -- ?

22

MR. DEFORD:

Well, that was exactly what Congress

23

has said can be done, both with respect to the Federal

24

Government's supplemental security income program, which

25

provides cash assistance and with respect to the categoricall}'

6

1

needy who are those Medicaid recipients, especially the aged,

2

blind, and disabled, who are eligible for SSI supplemental

3

security income, and are then automatically eligible for

4

Medicaid as categorically needy.

5

contrast, although they are also aged, blind, and disabled,

6

are not eligible for SSI cash benefits, but Congress has

7

determined that they should be eligible for Medicaid once

8

they have spent down their income to the level of impoverish­

9

ment determined by Congress and by the federal agency.

10

The medically needy, by

As far as Congress is concerned, once a medically

1 1

needy individual, when his income is over the categorical

12

eligibility levels, spends down, that person is to be treated

13

the same as if he or she had originally been found eligible

14

for Medicaid automatically as categorically needy.

15

The state has argued throughout that its transfer

16

rule applied only to the medically needy does not violate the

17

federal Medicaid statute.

18

the statute is supported by its legislative history and

19

by the repeated statements of the responsible federal agency,

20

the Department of Health and Human Services, does not permit

21

more restrictive treatment against the medically needy than

22

against the cateogorically needy.

23

extent agreed with us on that point, that there was a general

24

requirement of comparability between the medically and cate­

25

gorically needy.

It is our feeling, however, that

The 9th Circuit to a great

Where the 9th Circuit disagreed, however,
7

1

was in determining that the transfer rule was not necessarily

2

a violation of the comparability requirement, as there were

3

other rules which were the same between the categorically and

4

medically needy.

5

one different rule wouldn't necessarily violate a compara­

6

bility requirement.

Therefore, the 9th Circuit determined that

This interpretation, however, directly contradicts

7

8

the longstanding decisions, the consistent and longstanding

9

interpretations of the responsible federal agency, HHS, and

10

its predecessor, the Department of Health, Education, and

1 1

Welfare.
QUESTION:

12
13
14

At what level were these decisions ren­

dered?
MR. DEFORD:

These decisions were rendered from the

15

main offices in Washington, sent out to the regional offices

16

throughout the country, which then have notified the various

17

state administrators on various occasions.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. DEFORD:

Can you -- are they in the record?
The only -- we do not have in the

20

record the original statement which is known as a PIQ.

21

No. 77 was sent out in, I believe, in 1977, to the various

22

regional administrators informing them specifically that

23

transfer of assets rules could not be applied only to the

24

medically needy.

25

that the regional administrator for the region which

PIQ

What is in the record, however, is a letter

8

California is in, sent to Defendant Myers informing her that

2

the California rule was violative of the .federal law.

5

QUESTION:

Now, what is a PIQ?

Is that issued by

a regulation?
MR. DEFORD:

It's not a regulation.

It is a speci­

6

fic guideline establishing how HEW and now HHS interprets

7

the way the statutes and regulations of the Federal Govern­

8

ment should work together.

MR. DEFORD:

Can we find it in CFR or -- ?
No, it's not in the Code of Federal

Regulations.

Where would one look for it?
Presumably -- it's not published,

17

Department of Health and Human Services which have appeared

18

in various other publications which indicate specifically on

19

this point, and then again on the general point of compara­

20

bility between the medically needy and the categorically

21

needy, that this treatment is impermissible.

Mr. Deford, somewhere, at your leisure,

MR. DEFORD:

Yes, definitely, Your Honor.

The in-

24

the regulations is not one which we have invented off the

25

top of our heads.

It is one which the Department of Health,

QUESTION:

23

MR. DEFORD:

I don't think she ever received SSI

She was eligible for it?
She was eligible

Well, then, it seems to me, if your

7

facts are right, she's eligible under (a) and you don't even

8

have to reach the comparability clause.

The difference, Your Honor, is that

The basis of our argument, and that on which the

15

Department of Health and Human Services has rested its inter­

16

pretation, is 42 USC -- I'm sorry to give this lengthy cite,

17

but it's the only one we have -- Section 1396a(a)(10)(C)(i),

18

which is as far down as the Medicaid statute goes.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. DEFORD:

Wait till next year.
That statute defines the medically

21

needy and it defines them as identical to the categorically

22

needy in every respect save one, and that is that they have

23

greater income or resources, greater gross income or resources

24

before the cost of medical care is taken into consideration.

25

QUESTION:

Is that cited in your brief?
14

MR. DEFORD:

1

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

I believe it

2

is.

Congress concluded that the medically needy, once their

3

medical costs were taken into consideration, were virtually

4

identical with the categorically needy.

5

impoverished and therefore equally deserving of Medicaid

coverage.

8

SSI recipient, is identical with someone eligible for cate­

They were equally

15

same is a categorically needy individual.

16

but for this individual's income and resources,

If the answer is "yes," then the indi­

Consequently, HHS has determined regularly and

17

repeatedly that on the basis of this statute a state cannot

18

apply more restrictive rules to the medically needy than

19

to the categorically needy.

20

not permitted to apply transfer rules only to the medically

21

needy and to disenfranchise them from eligibility when the

22

identically situated categorically needy individual

23

mains eligible for benefits regardless of any transfers

that that person may have undertaken.

The Public Law

1

96-611, Section 5, which was passed by Congress in December

2

of 1980 does modify the congressional policy towards transfer

of assets.

4

denies eligibility to a Medicaid recipient who has transfer­

5

red assets in the past with the intent of attaining eligi­

6

bility for Medicaid.

7

nize, however, that that statute continues the general con­

8

gressional policy that the medically need should be treated

9

no more restrictively than the categorically needy.

It allows a state to implement a rule which

Mr. Magasin, before you get into your

argument, can I just ask you a question about that.

2

ing the transfer is of sufficient assets to bring the

3

transferor down into an income level that will make him or

4

her eligible for SSI benefits, would he not then be eligible

5

under Subparagraph (a)?
MR. MAGASIN:

6
7

To the extent that there would be a

transfer.
QUESTION:

8
9

Suppos­

And it was deliberate and all the rest.

But as I understand it, we're really only dealing with the

10

transfers that are not quite as large as they might have been

11

and even under your view they could transfer some more assets

12

in order to get down under the SSI level and then become

13

eligible.

14

Is that right?
MR. MAGASIN:

Well, to the extent they transferred

15

all of their assets and also with the income and resource lev­

16

el requirements of SSI, conceivably they could qualify for

17

SSI and be eligible --

18

QUESTION:

And then if they're qualified for SSI,

19

they automatically get the Medicaid too, even if they got to

20

be qualified by reason of a transfer of assets?

21

MR. MAGASIN:

Yes.

The reason for this is because

22

under the SSI program we're obligated to follow the SSI

23

standard, so under the SSI program, at least prior to the

24

Boren/Long Amendment, a transfer of assets even for a valuable

25

consideration to a relative or to a friend would make him
26

1

eligible.

2

QUESTION:

Right.

3

MR. MAGASIN:

The striking down of the transfer of

The transfer of assets rule creates a rebuttable

presumption that any transfer of assets for less than adequate

consideration within two years prior to applying was made wit?

Now, to rebut

10

the presumption, the applicant may produce evidence that

1 1

adequate resources were available at the time of the transfer

12

for their support and medical care considering such things as

13

the applicant's competency and life expectancy and health at

14

the time.

15
16

If the applicant fails to rebut the presumption,
then the states can deny benefits.

QUESTION:

And is there a hearing that -- ?

11

MR. MAGASIN:

Well, they can request a hearing.

12

Normally, what happens is there's a notice of action which

13

goes out saying, you are being denied benefits.
QUESTION:

14

Then, that --

And we put a value on your transfer

15

of $50,000 and until that's eaten up you are no longer enti­

16

tled to assistance.
MR. MAGASIN:

17

Exactly.

In addition, the notice says,

18

you may request a fair hearing to produce evidence to rebut

19

the presumption.

20

QUESTION:

MR. MAGASIN:

22

You mean there was no request here?
There was no request here; yes.

QUESTION:

Is there anything in the regulation or

presumption after a lapse of time?

At some point that presumption must achieve a

They didn't pursue any

Well, to the extent that it's not

rebutted, yes, to that extent the presumption would hold up
and then my answer is, yes.
It also should be noted that the transfer of assets

a transfer of assets.

doesn't say you can't impose a transfer of assets rule.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume there at

You

may

continue,

Mr. Magasin.
MR. MAGASIN:

As I have previouslv indicated, there

18

is no statute under Title XIX which specifically prohibits

19

a transfer of assets rule.

20

first of all, consistent with 42 USC 1396a(a)(10)(C) , and as

21

I indicated, the plain language of the section does not pre­

22

clude such a rule.

23

that the medically needy'group includes all individuals who

24

would, except for income and resources, be eligible for SSI.

25

A transfer of assets rule is,

The first part of the statute provides

Now this section may be read as specifically
38

1

excluding income and resources and it equates the SSI eligi­

2

bility to the medically needy eligibility requirement.

3

Now the transfer of assets rule can clearly be construed as a

4

financial eligibility requirement which pertains to the

5

applicant's income and resources, and therefore clearly comes

6

within the exception to the first clause of the statute.
Now, the second part of the statute, the gist of

7

8

which provides that the medically needy group includes all of

9

those individuals who have insufficient income and resources

10

as determined under comparable standards to pay for their own

1 1

medical care.

12

that the evaluation of the applicant's income and resources

13

be determined by using comparable standards.

14

cated, comparable does not necessarily mean identical; only

15

similar.

16
17
18

Now, this section may be read as requiring

QUESTION:
to?

And as I indi­

What do you think the comparable refers

Comparable to what, in your view of the statute?
MR. MAGASIN:

Well, the 9th Circuit found that the

19

comparability in this clause referred to -- they didn't speci­

20

fically say it, but they read it that it might require

21

comparability between the categorically needy and the medi­

22

cally needy.

23

which suggests that comparability between these groups was

24

never intended by the second part of the statute,

25

On the other hand, there is legislative intent

QUESTION:

My question is, how do you read it?
39

MR. MAGASIN:

1

Well, I would submit that the legis­

2

lative intent seems to be clear in this regard.

3

would give more credibility to the 9th Circuit's opinion

4

in this matter.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. MAGASIN:

However, I

I still don't understand how you read it.
I would submit that there would be

7

comparability between the medically needy and the categori­

8

cally needy.

9

tion of those words,

As I said, there is a conflicting interpreta­

QUESTION:

10

In other words, that the standards for

1 1

determining SSI eligibility must be comparable to the stan­

12

dards for determining Medicaid eligibility?

13

MR. MAGASIN:

14

QUESTION:

15

And in SSI eligibility, it does prohibit

the transfer of assets rule?

16

MR. MAGASIN:

17

QUESTION:

18

Yes, this reading.

That's correct.

So if the comparability concept includes

it, you'd say the the same rule would apply?
MR. MAGASIN:

19

No, I would submit that this excepts

20

our income and resource standards, that they don't have to

21

be the same, that you could have a transfer of assets re­

22

striction and this would be similar, but not necessarily

23

identical.

24

25

Now, the transfer of assets rule is also consistent
with 42 USC Section 1396a(a)(17)(B).
40

Now, this section

1

requires that only available income

and

resources

con-

2

sidered in making eligibility determinations be considered

3

under the Medicaid program.

4

Now, when you look at this statute, which is also

5

supposed to conflict with the transfer of assets provision,

6

we notice that there is no plain preclusion of the transfer

7

of assets rule in this section either.

8

in the legislative history which prevents the consideration

9

of a transferred asset as available.

Now, there is nothing

In fact, the purpose of

10

the availability rule prevents the counting of assets o:f a relative

1 1

as available to the applicant.

12

section is not meant to apply to a person who manufactures el

13

gibility by giving away assets that could be used for medical

14

expenses.

15

Transfer of assets rule -- this

Now, the transfer of assets rule is also consistent

16

with a federal regulation which the petitioners cite.

17

is 42 CFR, Section 435.401(c).

18

provides that states not use requirements for determining

19

eligibility for the medically needy

20

tive than those used for the categorically needy.

21

This

Now this section in effect

which are more restric­

Now, we submit that this section does not apply to

22

a financial eligibility requirement such as the transfer of

23

assets rules.

24
25

We base this opinion as follows.

The section was found under the general heading
and title, "Subpart (e), General Eligibility Requirements."

Now Subpart (e) does not apply to financial eligibility con­

specifically states that it is meant to refer to nonfinancial

eligibility requirements.

7

It applies to citizenship,

or

Now, further support for this interpretation is
The prior wording

Now, it's very interesting to note is that within

8

Part 435 of the CFRs, Subpart (i) specifically covers finan­

9

cial eligibility requirements for the medically needy.

In

10

this section it would be logical you would see a transfer of

11

assets restriction.

12

(i) which specifically deals with income and resource require­

13

ments for the medically needy.

14

There is no such restriction in Subpart

I would like to also discuss the Boren/Long

15

Amendment.

16

Amendment precludes the imposition of a transfer of assets rul e

17

prior to the enactment of the law.

Now, the law itself was

18

signed into effect on December 28,

1980, and has been desig­

19

nated Public Law 96-611, Section 5.

20

that it not only permits transfer, of assets rules In a Title

21

XIX program but it also permits them in a Title XVI program,

22

the SSI-SSP programs.

Now, it has been argued that the Boren/Long

It's interesting to note

23

Now, it's also very interesting to note is that

24

Congress in these provisions of the Boren/Long Amendment,

25

these provisions are very similar to California's transfer
42

1

of assets restriction.

2

are very similar.

3

Boren/Long Amendment was to correct an abusive practice

4

whereby individuals transfer substantial assets to relatives

5

to qualify for medical assistance.

6

the problem that California had noted all along.

7

There are some differences but they

Congress's intent in enacting this

So Congress recognized

Now, it should be noted that not every amendment

8

of a statute demonstrates legislative intent to make a change

9

in the substance of a preexisting law.

We would submit that

10

the Boren/Long Amendment constitutes an exclusive permission

11

to the states to impose a transfer of assets rule, and this

12

is further buttressed by the fact that certain reports of

13

the Senate Finance Committee suggest that the Amendment was

14

the result of congressional desire to remedy the effect of

15

erroneous court decisions striking down the rule, so

16

apparently Congress was aware at this time of these deci­

17

sions perhaps in the 2nd and 4th Circuits striking down the

18

rule and said, we don't want to give credibility to those

19

decisions, we are enacting this provision, and we want to

20

make sure that it is not intended to show that we agree with

21

those decisions striking down the rule.

22

Based

on

the

foregoing,

23

opinion should be affirmed.

this concludes our presentation.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

QUESTION:.

Mr. Deford, before you commence, may I

8

ask what relief you now think would be appropriate in light

9

of the amendment to the statute?
MR. DEFORD:

10

The appropriate relief now would be

11

for the District Court to notify the members of the class

12

of the decision of this Court, if it reverses, and to allow

13

those individuals to apply for the state administrative

been denied by the illegal transfer of assets rule in the past

MR. DEFORD:

Probably, in light of the fact that

18

this Court could not rule until nearly the time in which the

19

Boren/Long Amendment goes into effect for Medicaid appli­

20

cants, injunctive relief would only affect a very few number

of applicants in the future.
