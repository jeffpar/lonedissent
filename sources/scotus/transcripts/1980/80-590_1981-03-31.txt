ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES D. KENNEDY, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHAiLF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. KENNEDY:

7

8

We'll hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

9

We are here today on a writ of certiorari to the

10

Texas Court of Civil Appeals, 14th Judicial District, on a

1 1

matter raising two issues.

12

ject matter jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Texas

13

to consider and try and hear cases arising

14

Continental Shelf Lands Act.

15

involving the applicability of this Court's ruling in the case

16

of Liepelt which finds that juries are knowledgeable taxpayers

17

of this country -- I'm paraphrasing -- and that therefore

18

the trial court has the duty of performing and providing in­

19

structions to the jury as to the effect of federal income

20

taxation on jury damage awards.

21

I'd like to

first

First, there's an issue of sub­

under the Outer

The second issue is an issue

turn

briefly

to’

what I feel

22

is the threshold question, and that is the question of subject

23

matter jurisdiction to allow the courts of many states to

24

take jurisdiction for matters arising on the Outer Continental

25

Shelf.
3

In 1953 the Outer Continental Shelf was becoming a

1

2

very vital area.

3

time that there must be a necessity for jurisdiction over

4

this developing area.

5

going into a state and buying land or taking land away from

6

an already existing state.

7

rest in this Court's opinion in United States v. California.

8

California had claimed ownership of the tidelands.

9

The Congress of this country felt a: that

This is not a situation of the Congress

This had already been laid to

The state found that the United States had paramount iurisdic-

10

tion over the tidelands.

1 1

the state's claim to rights in the tideland areas, Congress

12

passed, also in 1953, the Submerged Lands Act which ceded to

13

the states that area lying offshore of their land areas that

14

had historically been claimed by the states.
QUESTION:

15
16

Because of the historic nature of

Do you think the '53 Act was prinarily

thought of in terms of personal injury jurisdiction?
MR. KENNEDY:

17

No, Your Honor, I think it was thought

18

of

19

tal Shelf beyond the Submerged Land Act's ceding of rights

20

to territorial waters of the state.

21

to encompass the entire activities on the Outer Continen­

The personal injury aspect of this case comes up

22

incidental.

This is really a case involving a contractual

23

dispute between the Pool Corporation, who is a drilling con­

24

tractor, and Mobil Oil Company, who was the leasor of the area

25

that was being drilled.

The plaintiff in the case below was
4

1

an employee of Pool Corporation, an employee of my client.

2

On the basis of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act

3

Mr. Gaedecke, the plaintiff's-

4

poration was

5

Compensation Act which is definitely adopted as the exclusive

6

remedy of employees on the Outer Continental Shelf.

7

Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act also

8

recognizes the right of third party suits by such employees

9

under Section 905(b) if it happens to be due to the negli­

under

the

sole

against Pool Cor­

Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers'

10

gence of a vessel, under Section 33 if it is due to any other

1 1

type of third party action.

12

primary claim had to arise under the Outer Continental Shelf

13

Lands Act, and under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers'

14

Act

So this all, the plaintiff's

was thereby extended.
We move then to an area where because of interna­

15
16

tional implication the Government had severe reservations of

17

attempting to take sovereignty beyond the states' historical

18

territorial limits.

19

the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act which was a horizontal

20

extension of jurisdiction of the Federal Government to cover

21

the subsoils, seabeds, and any artificial islands constructed

22

thereon.

23

jurisdiction over the high seas, leaving that to the maritime

24

and admiralty courts.

25

They adopted the procedure set out in

The Act specifically did not attempt to take on any

The Act itself, after first providing for this
5

1

extension of jurisdiction, then turned its attention to what

2

laws would be applicable in this Outer Continental Shelf area,

3

in this new area of jurisdiction for the Federal Government.

4

They first said that federal law and regulations are applica­

5

ble.

6

to promulgate rules and regulations which were made applicable

They delegated to the Secretary of Interior the right

Then, in order to Dlug any potential gaps or voids

7

8

in the federal law as it existed at that time, they said that

9

we are going to adopt as federal law the law of the adjacent state.
QUESTION:

10
11

You're paraphrasing now from pages 3 and

4 of your brief?

-■

MR. KENNEDY:

12

■

,

I'm paraphrasing; yes.

They said --

13

I'm paraphrasing this -- that if there is a void, if Congress

14

has not acted, or if there has been no rule or regulation

15

promulgated by the Secretary of Interior, then, to fill these

16

voids, we will adopt, or we will have as surrogate for federal

17

law -- surrogate federal law -- the law of the adjacent

18

state.

19

clearly shows that there is exclusive jurisdiction.

20

put a caveat -- pardon me?

21

But, in the Act itself -- and I think the Act itself

QUESTION:

They

I was just going to say, it's on page

22

three of your brief, Section B of the statute says the United

23

States district courts shall have original jurisdiction of

24

cases and controversies.

It does not say original and

25

exclusive, and certainly

in FELA cases and in 1983 cases
6

1

the federal courts are the primary fora but nonetheless state

2

courts can entertain 1983 actions and it's my understanding

3

that state courts can entertain FELA actions.
MR. KENNEDY:

4

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, and

5

I think you have to look to the enactment, in its entirety,

6

to see the Congressional scheme, and after we get through

7

that, I think that the Congressional scheme within the Act

8

itself will be sufficient.

9

then you're left with the legislative intent which I'll go

10

But even if you get beyond that,

into in a minute.

11

The caveat that was put in the Act in Subsection

12

(a)(2), after they say, "will adopt state law as surrogate

13

federal law," says, "all applicable laws shall be adminis­

14

tered and enforced by the appropriate officers and courts of

15

the United States."

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. KENNEDY:

18

QUESTION:

19

20
21

22

And again, it doesn't say "exclusively."
No.

But you want us to read it that way, I

take it?
MR. KENNEDY:

Yes, Your Honor.

Because I think this

is the clear congressional intent.
QUESTION:

In our own Article III jurisdiction, as

23

you no doubt know, the provision is, with respect to some

24

kinds of cases our jurisdiction is original and exclusive,

25

and with respect to others it's just original but not
7

1

exclusive.
HR.

2

KENNEDY:

That's right.

The reason I think Con­

3

gress did not feel compelled to include this word "exclusive,’1

4

and as we'll discuss later, in the 1978 amendments to this

5

Act, even dropped out the word "original," was because this

6

was an area where there was no concurrent jurisdiction,

7

where the states had no jurisdiction.

8

Government went out and said, we are taking jurisdiction over

9

this area.

And therefore the word "original" and the word -QUESTION:

10

And so the Federal

A state court is generally a court of

1 1

general jurisdiction and if one party from Venezuela sues

12

another party from Holland over an accident that happened

13

500 miles out at sea, unless there is some federal Drohibi-

14

tion or statutory enactment prohibiting it, the federal court

15

can take jurisdiction or the state court can take jurisdic­

16

tion of that, can't it?
MR. KENNEDY:

17

I think -- of course, if we're getting

18

out to sea I think we're getting into an entirely different

19

area, where we're getting into the admiralty and maritime

20

courts.

21

foreign nationals for injuries on the high sea, my recollec­

22

tion is that it's exclusively federal at that point, when

23

you have foreign nationals on the high seas.

Whether the states have anv jurisdiction between

QUESTION: How about Bremen v. Zapata?

25

MR. KENNEDY:

The federal courts took jurisdiction

1

over that.

2

I believe.

It was a federal court case arising in admiralty,

In subsection (3) of the same portion of the Outer

what the congressional intent was.

tion of the state law as the law of the United States shall

7

never be interpreted as a basis for claiming any interest in

13

that may be found in other sections.

It doesn't say excludes provisions or existing law

MR. KENNEDY:

Well, Your Honor, I don't know of

15

any existing law at the time of the passage of the 1953 Act

16

that gave any general jurisdiction to state courts over what

17

happens on the high seas or, at that time, the Outer

18

Continental Shelf.

20

Prior to 1953 there was no Outer Conti­

The congressional intent is clear from a reading of

the legislative history.

on Interior and Insular Affairs, which is the majority report,

24

the Court will recall this case, this Act, came first up

25

through the House, was sent to the Senate.

The report of the Senate Committee

9

The Senate

1

deleted practically all of the House Act, substituted their

2

own.

The Commerce Committee accepted it and then it became

3

law.

So therefore the report, of the Senate Committee was

4

actually the majority report.

5

the bill was to assert the exclusive jurisdiction and control

6

of the Federal Government of the United States over the

7

seabed, subsoil, and artificial islands.

8

we're going to carry out this primary purpose of the measure,

9

the asserting of exclusive jurisdiction, by developing a body

This body of law is going to consist of the Consti­

of the Federal Government.

14

the regulations, rules, and operating orders of the Secretary

of Interior.

criminal law of the state adjacent will be adopted as federal

So, here again, they knew exactly what they were doing.
QUESTION:

Is there any reason why the Texas state

20

courts can't apply federal law the way they do under FELA and

21

under 1983?

22

MR. KENNEDY:

I think you have to look at the com­

23

pelling reasons for this under the Outer Continental Shelf

24

Act itself.

25

Government to state governments.

Jurisdiction could have been ceded by the Federal

10

I think, in a situation such as

1

this , since we have no concurrent jurisdiction to begin with

2

or no state jurisdiction over this area to begin with, there

3

was a taking enacted by Congress, ceding it back as they did

4

in the Submerged Lands Act, saying, okay, Mr. Louisiana, Mr.

5

Texas, we give you the right over this area.

6

QUESTION:

Isn't there an intermediate ground where

7

you don't cede the territory back but you say that federal law

8

may be applied in the courts of the adjacent state?

9

MR. KENNEDY:

10

indicate that this was an intent

11

minority people definitely recognized that this was not the

12

intent of Congress.

13

have nothing to do with control of this area on the Outer

14

Continental Shelf because with all the international implica­

15

tions that were then involved, Congress was obviously worried

16

at that time that there was going to be a hue and outcry from

17

our world friends that we were trying to take over the sove­

18

reignty of this seabed area.

19

in placing this, I feel, in the hands of the Federal Govern­

20

ment to rule and regulate without interference from the

21

many states.

22

But there is nothing in the Act to
of Congress.

In fact, the

Congress wanted the adjacent states to

That's why they were so careful

We're talking about not just one or two states that

23

might have an interest in --

The Outer Continental Shelf

extends, of course, completely around the continental United

25

States, varying in size from 250 miles off the New England

coast to 50 to 150 miles in the Gulf of Mexico, to as little

as five to 40 miles off California.

in the Rodrigue opinion.

1 1

opinion it shows a clear indication of the vesting of exclu­

12

sive jurisdiction in the federal courts.

13

Mr. Justice White, it states that "on the other hand, federal

14

enforcement of the law in this area was insisted upon by the

15

Department of Justice and there was substantial doubt whether

8

the most part all of Senator Ellender's original amendment,

9

but deleting any possibility of confusion that the amendment

10

may in some way provide for the taxing powers of the states.

11

We thought maybe that was what the Congress was looking at,

12

just simply that they were afraid this was going to give the

13

states taxing powers.

14

Senator Long does, and that amendment was defeated after floor

15

argument.

16

was a compromise amendment with the majority leaders, and

17

simply added the word "adjacent state” to what law was to be

18

adopted as federal law, because the original Act said, just

19

the nearest point of land, the law would apply.

20

put in this adjacent state rule instead of the nearest point

21

of land.

22

Senator Long from Louisiana filed a subsequent

Senator Long then submitted another amendment; it

And that is what was finally enacted.
Senator Long filed the minority report and recog­

nized in his minority report that there was no state court

jurisdiction as far as this Act was concerned, and that was

25

his brief or his minority report.
13

He was still unhappy and

1

dissatisfied with the congressional action, so I think there

2

was clear legislative intent as to what Congress was proposing

3

to do.
Now, this case in 25 years up to 1978, this legisla­

tion, had already been piecemealed and added to, in a piece­

MR. KENNEDY:

Well, I didn't really anticipate the

Liepelt decision but I knew sooner or later that the law had

16

to recognize the fact that juries were continuously being

17

confused by the fact that nobody would tell them what effect

taxes had on them.

19

it is our position that the Liepelt opinion simply requires ar

20

instruction by the judge to the jury that they should neither

21

take it, neither increase nor delete anything from their

award because of federal income tax and it is that the award

We say that that falls directly in line with this

That's the second way.

If you can't do it

in those two ways, then you must show that the exercise of

concurrent jurisdiction in the state courts is simply incom­

13

patible by the nature of the case itself with concurrent

Now, from a practical standpoint, we cannot fathom

why concurrent jurisdiction over Outer Continental Shelf

MR. CATON:

v. Treinies and those cases say

I agree with that, Your Honor.

The

20

point I'm really trying to make is that under the Lambert Run

21

Coal Company line of cases, it's clear that a federal court

22

cannot take jurisdiction in a removed action unless the state

23

court had original jurisdiction of that case.

It's just inconsistent that he could rely on

Now, in order to take care of the objective of

10

developing the riches, the resources on the Outer Continental

1 1

Shelf, Congress simply passed two acts.

12

Submerged Lands Act, which was called the quitclaim legisla­

13

tion which gave the gulf states a three marine leagues area

14

off their low mean tide shore, and it gave the ocean states

15

a three statute mile area off their coast.

16

along in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act case and said,

17

now we're going to take care of two things:

18

provide for development of those riches, and we are going

19

to provide for what you are going with the revenue that you

20

obtain from those riches.

21

I think,

It passed the

when we. get back to the 'CTaflin v. House­

22

man rule, which says that unless you can meet one of the

23

tests which were established by Mr. Hamilton, that I've al­

24

ready mentioned, then you cannot take away from the state

25

courts their historic concurrent jurisdiction of these cases.
25

1

Now, I don't dispute that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands

2

Act created a new statutory remedy, and we started from

3

scratch with a federal law which we have to apply as surro­

4

gate federal law, but it is not a new remedy.
And strangely enough, in the Houseman case, again,

5

6

Mr.

Bradley anticipated that, Justice Bradley, and he said

7

specifically, that it was mentioned by Justice Story.

8

said it was indeed intimated by Mr. Justice Story over a

9

dictum in Martin v. Hunter that the state courts could not

He

10

take cognizance of cases arising under the Constitution, laws,

1 1

and treaties of the United States, as no such jurisdiction

12

existed before the Constitution was adopted.

13

14

States authority, but the same jurisdiction existed, at least

15

to a certain extent, under the authority of the states."

And

we can't take that to the county court.
If we are really looking at the pragmatic factors,

because Congress didn't and we therefore have to do it,

4

how can we be pragmatic and take the position that we are

5

going to congest the federal court dockets more by giving

6

them all of the cases and controversies which were tradi­

7

tionally handled by state courts and turn those into the

8

hands of federal courts?

That is not being pragmatic.

The Act does not

The idea that

10

because you do not say, we are granting concurrent jurisdic­

1 1

tion to the state courts, has been ridiculed many times by

the treatise writers, including Professor Redish, because

13

that's begging the question.

QUESTION:

Well, the exclusive argument -- if you're

13

right, the exclusive argument is beside the point, because

14

it's state law, and obviously you're not going to have some

15

exclusive jurisdiction in the federal court over a state law

16

cause of action.

17

MR. JAMAIL:

But we have to address it, because this

18

Court does have the right to interpret that statute, and I

19

must address myself --

20
21

22

QUESTION:

So it is a cause of action under the

statute?
MR. JAMAIL:

No,

it is a cause of action applying

state law, and if we're going to be semantical, state law

the judge refused it.

Procedurally he did not comply with

everything he must do in order for this Court to rule on the

13

Jurisdiction, if I may, again.

Never do we see the

14

word, and I would like to -- original jurisdiction has

15

meaning in only one context, that is when it is applied in

16

relation to appellate jurisdiction.

17

need to dwell upon that.

18

Justice Brennan said it in Sun Ship v. Pennsylvania, if

19

counsel's argument is that exclusion of the wohd "original"

20

then made it necessary for you to interpret it as meaning

21

"exclusive," then that is a tour de force of statutory

22

interpretation, and I begged and borrowed the words from

Justice Brennan.

MR. JAMAIL:

QUESTION:

Yes.
I gather -- do I correctly understand

your argument? -- even if this case were tried the day after

we had case law, Louisiana

happens to poor Mr. Gaedecke?

the statute of limitations runs and then says you don't have

any jurisdiction over here.

9

no jurisdiction.

The respondent lays back until

And then he comes in and says,

Now, what happens to Mr. Gaedecke?

The

10

Court can say, well, we will rely on Justice Potter Stewart's

1 1

opinion in the Chevron v. Huson which said that, well, it

12

would be too harsh and too unjust to send it back now because

13

where is his remedy?

14

But I'm not relying on that.

This is not -- I'm

15

saying the law itself, the Act itself, imposes no exclusive

16

jurisdiction.

fully this Court will not by judicial fiat say, all right,

we're going to say exclusive jurisdictions.

you've got to do is take it in context.

Now, again, we

If the Court is going to

extend Liepelt -- and I'm asking the Court to do it in a

8

"sunburst" sort of way and not make it retroactive with the

9

harshness that would result to this man, simply because the

10

case was tried, as it had to be, of necessity, under the rules

that existed at the time, and both Louisiana substantive law

15

16

He is not properly before this Court on the

And that's made clear in our brief.
And I can only hope that the Court will not inflict

17

us -- we have to try lawsuits -- with the further burden, as

18

counsel for respondent suggests, a new body of federal law.

19

What's it going to be called?

20

already very difficult to try one of these cases, and the

21

court said that, and everyone, I think, will agree that the

22

courts below are doing all they can to interpret.

23

whatever happens, there ought to be a clear enunciation,

24

first that there is no exclusivity in the federal court for

25

this type of action for if there had meant to be Congress

Nobody intended that.

39

It's

I think,

would have told us so.
Secondly, that we will not further encroach on

state jurisdiction by judicial fiat.

will not extend Liepelt beyond what it was intended to do.

this in the face of the Penrod cases, Starnes and Johnson

I say that there must be evidence.

And if the Court

So, I am asking this Court to confine Liepelt to

21

what it's meant to be, the interpretation of a federal

22

statute, and a death case at that, where the net pecuniary

23

loss is the damage issue involved;

24

the common law tort action where there are other elements of

damages; and certainly to hold that there's no jurisdiction

and not to insert it into

that exclusive jurisdiction lies in the federal courts.
