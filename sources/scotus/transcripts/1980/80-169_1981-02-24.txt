MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

against William Mitchell.
Mr. Segal, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD G. SEGAL, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. SEGAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

The facts of this case are very simple.

11

Petitioner, United Parcel Service, was charged with having

12

discharged unfairly an employee, who was charged with having

13

falsified his timecard and claiming payment for time that

14

he did not work.

15

vance procedure, all the way to arbitration before a joint

16

panel, regularly constituted, which, under the collective

17

bargaining agreement issues awards which are final and bind­

18

ing.

19

The

His union took his case through the grie­

Seventeen months later, Mitchell, the Plaintiff,

20

sued United Parcel Service and the union under Section 301 of

21

the Labor Management Relations Act, seeking reinstatement

22

and back pay, charging that the union had failed to repre­

23

25

of Appeals reversed, and held unlike the District Court which

Well the union remains a party to the

case though?

17

MR. SEGAL:

It is a party to the case.

18

QUESTION:

It's a respondent, isn't it?

19

MR. SEGAL:

20
21

22
23
24

25

It is a respondent in the case, just as

it has been.
QUESTION:

Well isn't it entitled to file a brief

for or against the judgment below?
MR. SEGAL:

It has done so, we have been in consul-

t ation with the union and while I am not here to argue its
cause, if the Court should have any questions I would endeavor
4

1

to answer them.

3

QUESTION:

Well Mr. Segal, if you prevailed, what

would be the status of the case against you?

4

MR. SEGAL:

If we prevailed, it would be up to this

5

Court and there have been differences on this Court, as Mr.

6

Justice Brennan, you know, quite recently on this kind of

7

issue, on whether they are divisible, whether they should

8

be divisible, whether the Court should, itself, ordain a

9

rule, if it were finally to get around to what the dissen­

10

ters most recently said I guess, in the Occidental case.

11

Then

12

the Plaintiff would be out by virtue of'the 90 day statute of

13

limitations; as to us, it would go back on a remand as to the

14

union. While the petition was pending the Third Circuit

15

decided the Liotta case, which was really on all fours

16

with what the District Court did -- held that a 90 day

17

statute in these very facts would apply.

18

real significance, very important significance in labor

19

management relations throughout the United States and the

20

potential impact may best be seen, perhaps by the fact that

21

the International Brotherhood of Teamsters with its almost

22

two million members and its 80 to 100 thousand collective

23

bargaining agreements, has filed a brief amicus curia.e and

24

that the AFL-CIO with its 15 and 1/2 million members has

25

likewise filed a brief, taking

my guess is, it would apply it to both.

Otherwise,

very strong positions.

MR. SEGAL:

No, it was -- Justice Brennan, it was

a vague recollection that it was in a teamster case, but I'm

not sure.

However, no one has ever questioned that, the

it very clear that that is as final and binding as if it

13

that Section 301 actions might be brought against an employer

14

and a union, although the alleged breach was by arbitration;

15

that was the first case and that's why I mentioned it.

16

I might say that no statute of limitations was involved in

17

the Hines case, and I think anyone who reads the case would

18

feel that if there were a statute it would have been tolled

19

by virtue of the really monstrous facts there: an employee

20

having been found guilty, when two years later a clerk in a

21

motel admitted that he had stolen the money and not the

22

employee.

Now, then came Hoosier and I think that's about the

last case I want to mention, because that's a case which

would have been an unfair labor practice, did opt to look

1960.
So it was before Hines, a good deal

before Hines?
MR. SEGAL:

Yes.

But Hines' real significance,

16

I think, Mr. Justice White, is it was the first case where

17

an arbitration was gone into and overturned.

18

of arbitration -- there were a lot of articles at the time;

19

whether that was going to be seriously affected but.it wasn't

and I think the reason it wasn't is that as I say, if the

issue had been a statute of limitations, it would have

definitely been tolled under those facts.

in the reasoning of the Court is that every arbitration

They now go to the contract 5 or 6 years, in virtually

is just washed out.

I submit to Your Honors that if that

ever happened, we'd go back to strikes in place of arbi­
tration in the solution of industrial disputes in this
country.

Or possibly we'd go back to Congress

Congress has already adopted the statute, 10(b).
MR. SEGAL:

The 10(b) and that of course would

involve an unfair labor practice, and there's a little diffi­
culty in applying that to the employer.

And you run into

a whole gamut of reasoning, I would say that frankly if the
Court and the federal government generally were to want

be the best place to go.

use the analogy of the U.S. Arbitration Statute, often

Mr. Chief Justice, half my profession­

a former associate, sometime opponent, sitting on the bench

a six year, labor management relations become impractical

11

in America.

12

mean that when you sit down to negotiate a contract out

Mr. Segal, turning to the last paragraph

of the Court of Appeals' opinion in this case, the sentence

14

of labor disputes without undermining the employees ability

to vindicate his rights through 301 actions.

Mr. Justice Stevens, as I understand

it, it's a right which a plaintiff has absent statutory

provisions for tolling; that if you can demonstrate fraud

that you can set aside the award in three contingencies,

Well I understand that the tolling

you weigh the public considerations and the public consid­

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID JAROSLAWICZ, ESQ.,

Mr. Jaroslawicz.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. JAROSLAWICZ:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

6

please the Court:

7

in a section 301 claim, it is not the statute of limitations

8

to vacate an arbitration award.

9

employee goes and that's Mr. Mitchell, or any other American

Whatever the statute of limitations may be

At least, insofar as the

10

worker, and I think it strange to see here today, labor and

1 1

management lined up on one side and nobody on the side of Mr.

12

Mitchell, and saying, if he claims something is wrong, give

13

him a forum to have his complaint heard.

14

QUESTION:

If this were true--

Isn't that the -- doesn't that permeate

15

the whole structure of federal law on industrial relations,

16

to resolve matters as quickly as possible?

17

MR. JAROSLAWICZ:

Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

And that's precisely the point.

19

employee has a chance to be heard in the arbitration and

20

the union doesn't sell him out, then he has no 301 claim

21

in the first place.

22

301 claim is where he has a more than probable showing that

23

the union sold him out, that he never had a hearing below

24

and then his forum is the courthouse.

25

those two basic standards, he doesn't have a 301 claim;

In those cases where the

then the arbitration is binding.
QUESTION:

Is that an unfair

labor practice

on the part of the union?
MR. JAROSLAWICZ:

It might be construed an unfair

labor practice yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well what is it if those two events

7

occur; that the union sells him out and he then has a forum

8

in the courthouse, what is the nature of his action, what is

9

it for and what statute of limitations is it governed by?

10

MR. JAROSLAWICZ:

I believe, Justice Rehnquist,

11

that it's a statutory claim, and I think it's most anal­

12

ogous to a 1983 action under the

13

MR. JAROSLAWICZ:

This case

does not have a 1983 claim, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

No, It couldn't.

MR. JAROSLAWICZ:

I'm simply saying that the most

analogous situation is that of a 1983 claim where all the
Courts have said that the statute of limitations to be
applied is the state statutes for a claim upon a statutory
claim, which in New York is three years, in other states it
might be two years.
QUESTION:

Well my question as to whether or not

it's an unfair labor practice was prompted by the amicus
brief filed in this case by the AFL CIO, which suggests that
the proper statute of limitations is that supplied by
Section 10(b) of the Labor Act.
MR. JAROSLAWICZ:

Which would be, I believe,

the six month statute.
QUESTION:

A six month statute.

MR. JAROSLAWICZ:

Which is what they are opting for,

20

And I don't believe it can be, Your Honor.

And the reason for1

21

that is the decision in Vaca v. Sipes, Justice Stewart.
22

Because as was pointed out there, an employee in this situ­
23

ation cannot obtain complete relief unless both the employer
24

and the union are in the suit together.

Because you have an

25

employee as Mr. Mitchell, who after 13 years was discharged.
24

1

You can't say to him we'll give you money, although money

2

is nice, he wants his job back, he wants his seniority back,

3

he wants his pension rights, and he wants his job where he

4

lives and he has worked for 15 years.

5

charge was improper.

This is -- his dis­

6

Now the other reason I say that this --

7

QUESTION:

You think it contributes to the -- what

8

permeates the whole industrial relations statutory structure,

9

to allow the

10

employee to wait five years and 11 months and

then bring a lawsuit of this kind?

1 1

HR. JAROSLAWICZ:

Well there are two answers to

12

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

the employee is not--who's out of work and has no money

14

is not going to wait until the end of the statute and say,

15

I'm going to take it down to the line and see what happens.

16
17

Certainly, if an employee does that, the Court
can limit his damages by saying he should have mitigated.

18

And finally, --

it's an equitable action that's governed by laches.

19

MR. JAROSLAWICZ:

If Your Honor pleases, I didn't

20

say it should be governed by laches, I was responding to

21

the Chief Justice's question as to what happens if an

22

employee waits for six years and I said if he waits properly

11

MR. JAROSLAWICZ:

I believe Justice Timbers took

that from this Court's decision in Hoosier.

13

in Hoosier, said that six years was relatively rapid and in

14

that case, admittedly, the Court was choosing between a 20 ye<

that six years was relatively rapid and sufficient to

Where this Court

And the reason I say to the Court that it can't be
a motion to vacate an arbitration award, is that nobody
even in this Court, argues that the Plaintiff's remedy or
the employee's remddy is to go' back and have a new arbitration
If this were truly an attempt to vacate an arbitration
award, as it is where there's corruption of an arbitrator,
the employee's remedy is to go back to a new arbitrator

But that

A section 301 claim is a separate claim, which the

4

5

statute and Congress has given an employee, it says if you

didn't have a fair hearing and the union sold you out,

to be here.

said.

10

And that's what Vaca said and that's what Hines

same statute of limitations as the union, we get a differ­

ent statute of limitations.

16

that the union clearly knows that it cannot possibly argue

17

that the statute of limitations as against the union is

18

90 days to vacate an arbitration award because there is

19

no arbitration award to be vacated against the union.

20

I believe the reason for that is

While the employer has a superficially appealing

21

argument, it says you're really trying to vacate an arbi­

22

tration award.

23

between the union and the employer, the employee's right

24

may have been at stake, but he never had a chance to be

heard and his rights weren't adjudicated, if not, he would

The arbitration was

2

never get to the section 301 claim.

And I say that if the

union or the employer wanted to bypass the arbitration

3

award or vacate it, if you will, here the statute of limi­

4

tations is 90 days, because that's the agreement between them.

5

But when it comes to the employee, it's not 90 days, and

6

under the standing issue, which I think the Second Circuit

7

probably recognized, he would have no standing in the

8

State of New York to even bring the proceeding, the New

9

York Court of Appeals has said if you're unhappy with what

10

^our union did, you bring a separate action, a 301 action,

1 1

against your union, but you can't interfere in the arbitra­

12

tion, which is a proceeding between the union and the employer.
That, Your Honor, is basically Mitchell's position.
