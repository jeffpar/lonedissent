ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS, CECIL D. ANDRUS, ET AL.

CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We deal this morning with the Kenai Moose Range
which I am told has been renamed the Kenai National Wildlife
Refuge a month ago in the enacted Alaska lands bill.

That

range or refuge is in south central Alaska, just south of
Anchorage, and east of Cook Inlet.
It comprises approximately two million acres of
lands, all within the Kenai Peninsula Borough, boroughs in
Alaska being comparable to counties elsewhere.

It was estab­

lished by withdrawal of public domain or public lands in the
United States, some 40 years ago.

Ever since the mid-1950s

oil and gas leases have been issued by the United States
covering portions of that acreage and substantial revenues have

20

been derived therefrom.

Indeed, since 1965 approximately

21

$80 million in royalties, rents, and bonuses have accrued
22

from those leases.
23

The issue presented to the Court is how those
24

federal revenues from this refuge ought to be distributed,
25

3

1

whether according to the formula ini the Mineral Leasing Act

2

of 1920, as Alaska maintains, which would have the result of

3

apportioning 90 percent, in the particular case of Alaska,

4

to the State and ten percent retained in the federal treasury;

5

or whether the appropriate formula is that ordained by the

6

Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act, an Act originally passed

7

in 1935 and amended in 1964, relevant to this case.

8

to that formula, the same revenues would be divided 25 percent

9

to the county out of which these lands have been created, or

10

this refuge has been created, and the remainder, 75 percent,

1 1

would go to the Conservation Fund.
In practice, the first formula, the formula of the

12
13
14

15
16
17

18
19

According

Mineral

Leasing Act of 1920, was followed.

And indeed, until

anyone thought about it, which was so far as the record indicates;
for the first time in 1975, that distribution formula obtained.
At that time, in 1975, the Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska
wondered to itself, and then out loud, whether the right
formula was being applied.

Thev accordingly inquired of the

Solicitor of the Department of the Interior for advice.

He

gave the opinion that it was being done wrongly and that the
20

formula of the Refuge Act, 25 percent to the county, is the
21

one that should have obtained at least since 1964.
22

He, in turn, the Solicitor, asked the opinion of
23

the Comptroller General of the United States.

The Comptroller

24

General agreed with the Solicitor and ruled accordingly.
25

4

1

Alaska then asked for 'reconsideration of that opinion, which

2

was duly given, but the Comptroller General adhered to his

3

view and reaffirmed his previous ruling.
At this point the Kenai Peninsula Borough would have

4

5

been the recipient under the Refuge Act and who would now

6

become the recipient under the ruling of the Comptroller

7

General, brought suit against the Secretary of the Interior

8

seeking a declaration that the Comptroller was indeed correct

9

and that his decision ought to be followed; and also asking

10

that the Secretary of the Interior be required to recoup the

1 1

monies now determined to have been erroneously paid to Alaska

12

rather than to the county in the previous decade.
Promptly thereafter the State of Alaska initiated a

13
14

15
16
17

18

19

20

separate lawsuit against the Secretary of the Interior, the
Secretary of the Treasury, and the Comptroller General, seek­
ing to set aside the ruling of the Comptroller General and to
obtain a declaration and an injunction that the old formula
that had been followed in practice should continue to be
followed, and that Alaska should continue to receive 90 percent
of these revenues.
The suits were consolidated in the district court

21

and in the meantime the monies accruing from the time of the
22

filing of the suits were held in suspense, where they still
23

are.
24

QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, is there any attempt on

25

5

1

the part of the Government to recover the money paid between

2

1964 and 1975?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

3

Your Honor, the Government resisted

4

the complaint of Kenai seeking to compel that action.

5

ruling having gone against the Government in the district

6

court and the court of appeals because there's been no occa­

7

sion to consider whether, should that ruling be reversed here,

8

it would be appropriate to seek recoupment, in our view it's

9

a decision which the Government is free to embark upon but

10

cannot be compelled to undertake.

1 1

with respect to what I've -QUESTION:

12
13

16

17

20

If you're right, Alaska has about $50

MR. CLAIBORNE:

That is so, Mr. Justice Stevens.

It may well be that the appropriate course would be for the
United States to bring an action, if necessary, to recoup that
money for the benefit of the borough.
QUESTION:

18
19

No decision has been reached

million that it shouldn't have, doesn't it?

14

15

The

Have there been occasions, Mr. Claiborne,

where the United States had this type of a claim in broad
terms and took no action to enforce the claim?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, without

21

being able to cite precedents, that one can find examples on
22

both sides; that is, cases in which the United States for
23

reasons of equity thought it improper to seek to redress the
24

past;

other instances in which it was thought right to recoup

25

6

1

the money and redistribute it in accordance with what is now

2

declared to be the correct rule.
QUESTION:

3

Well, Mr. Claiborne, both the question

4

of Justice Stevens and the question of the Chief Justice

5

suggest that the answer reached by the 9th Circuit is wrong

6

in this case.

7

on the issue, but when you get right down to the statutory

8

materials and go to the presumption against implied repeals

9

and the specific governing the general and other such maxims,

10

on the legal issue isn't it pretty close to a coin toss?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

1 1

12
13
14

15
16
17

18
19

I realize there's a good deal of money turning

I would not have thought so,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I own that two courts have held
against our position and we cannot therefore say that it's
absolutely clearcut that the Government's view as announced by
the Comptroller General and as we urge here is the correct one.
I do invoke the plain meaning rule as the governing canon of
construction in this case and this seems in our submission a
peculiarly appropriate instance in which Congress spoke as
clearly as one could hope for, much more clearly than is the
usual case, and one in which one ought to accept Congress at

20

its word.

And if one follows that analysis which we submit is

21

the correct one, then the case is indeed plain that an error
22

has been committed for these ten years and perhaps under those
23

circumstances the proper remedy is to redress that past error.
24

We are not speaking of the individual private
25

7

1

persons who have relied to their detriment on the error of

2

the Administrator who is speaking of a state whose mineral

3

revenues are so generous that they are able to repay their

4

own citizens.
At all events, as the Court well knows, the district

5

6

court ruled against the Secretary, despite finding that the

7

plain meaning of the statute was as contended for, but holding

8

in what can only be described as a most unusual construction

9

10
1 1

12
13
14

15
16

17

18

of the statute

that the word "minerals”, though in the stat­

ute apparently applicable to both refuges made up of acquired
lands and those made up of public domain lands, must be con­
strued by

a

judicial

decree

with

the

words of the stat­

ute so as to apply only in the one case and not in the other,
the reasoning behind that being that this would accomplish
no change in the law and that there was insufficient indica­
tion that Congress by adding the word "minerals" to the
Revenue Sharing Act meant to accomplish any change of the law.
The court of appeals affirmed that decision, basi­
cally on the same reasoning.

19

Now this case reaches the courts, and at least this
20

Court, only because of two circumstances that occurred after
21

the relevant statute had been enacted;

unfortunately, not

22

such rare occurrences, but still unfortunate.

The first is

23

that the Department of the Interior was very slow in imple­
24

menting the change of law, if that’s what it was, which had
25

8

1

2

occurred in 1964.
The second was that Congress, though having a clear

3

opportunity to indicate which was the correct view of their

4

own statute, expressly declined that invitation'in 1978 arid

5

said, since the matter is before the Court, we will let the

6

courts decide what we meant in 1964 rather than resolving it

7

themselves and sparing this and the other courts the need for

8

resolution.

14

15

17

19

Now the statute on its face, everyone has agreed,
at least until Alaska filed its brief in this Court, was per­
fectly plain.
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, before you get into your

analysis of the '64 statute, would you tell me what Is the
statutory authority for the Secretary to derive revenues from
the sale of timber, hay, grass, and all these others, sand
and gravel, the things other than minerals?

Is there some

statute that authorizes the disposition of those?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

The authority as understood by the

Department and indeed as recited in rulings of the Solicitor
is that the so-called Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act as

20

originally enacted in 1935 does authorize the Secretary -21

and, indeed, the words are reasonably clear to that end -- does
22

authorize the Secretary to grant sales or dispositions, which
23

in this context are understood to include leases , of those
24

products -- in the case of some of the products it's an
25

9

1

outright sale, but in other instances it's leases -- with

2

respect to both refuges made up of acquired lands and those

3

made up of public domain lands, without distinction.

4

QUESTION:

If the Mineral Leasing Act did not apply

5

would that statutory authority have authorized the making of

6

the leases that are involved here?

7

MR. CLAIBORNE:

We suggest that that is a possible

8

construction of the 1935 Act, even before its amendment, and

9

indeed that was the ruling of the Acting Solicitor of the

10

1 1

12
13
14

15
16

17

18

Department of the Interior in 1946, before the Acquired Lands
Act had been passed, and therefore the only authority then
available with respect to mineral leases on acquired lands.
He read the word "privileges" in that 1935 Refuge Act as in­
cluding the lease for oil and gas on acquired lands.

If It

applied to acquired lands, it likewise applied to public
domain lands, though unnecessarily, since the Mineral Leasing
Act of 1920 was already available for that purpose.
We do not deem it necessary for this Court to decide
that question, that is, what the law was before 1964, because

19

in 1964 Congress added the word "minerals" to those revenues
20

which could be leased, those resources which could be leased,
21

and the revenues from mineral leases as among those that ought
22

to be distributed according to the formula of the Act.
23

And it was that very plain action of adding the word "minerals"
24

that moots out the question -25

10

QUESTION:

1

It risn't entirely mooted out, because

2

isn't it normally true that the division of revenues would be

3

computed according to a statute that also grants the authority

4

to make the lease in the first place?

5

in your position to have the statutory authority for every­

6

thing but minerals in one statute, and the mineral leasing

7

authority in another statute, but say that- doesn't govern the

8

way the money should be divided up.

14

15
16

17

18
19

It's somewhat unusual

Mr. Justice Stevens, it is certainly

neater, if that's an appropriate word, if the same statute
both gives the authority and governs the distribution of
revenues.

I would point out that all leases of public lands

are distributed, or granted, under the Mineral Leasing Act of
1920 so

far as the mechanics are concerned, whether they're

acquired lands or not.

The Acquired Lands Act, for instance,

simply says, you may apply the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920
to acquired lands as you have been doing with respect to other
lands.

I have -QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, isn't there some real

basis, though, for treating acquired lands and domain lands
20

differently with respect to how much of a share of the royalty
21

should go to a county?
22

QUESTION:

Mr. Justice White, that may have been

23

the thought, but as -24

QUESTION:

Well, there would be a basis for doing it.

25

11

1

HR. CLAIBORNE:

2

QUESTION:

3

There would.

After all, acquired lands does reduce

the county's tax base.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

4

But, considering the revenues from

5

all other sources, all clearly divided under the Refuge Act,

6

whether from acquired or from public domain lands, it is diffi

7

cult to see why mineral revenues, that is, oil and gas reve­

8

nues, should be segregated for different treatment.
Now, there is a different formula.

9

It's not simply

10

25 percent in the case of acquired lands.

1 1

options available, more generous options

12

in practice seem to be more generous, than with respect to

13

the lands that are in refuges that come from the public

14

domain.

were done.

That was plainly the main purpose

But quite incidentally two other things

One was to authorize expressly the granting of

leases of public buildings and public accommodations, and
having those revenues distributed pursuant to the Refuge Act,
something the Comptroller General had ruled could not be done;
and then tying up this problem about minerals that was
ambiguous before.
QUESTION:

It doesn't -- perhaps the county might be

25

12

1

entitled to share more heavily with respect to acquired lands

2

but how about the public domain lands, that they never were

3

taxing anyway?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

4

Well, they do receive a share of all

5

other revenues, and it's difficult to appreciate why they

6

shouldn't receive a like share of mineral revenues.

7

one could argue that the State receives it for their benefit

8

in any event, but why should they not receive it directly in

9

the locality?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cranston.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES K. CRANSTON, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, KENAI PENINSULA BOROUGH
MR. CRANSTON:

15
16

Because

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
My name is Charles Cranston from Anchorage, Alaska,
representing the Kenai Peninsula

Borough.

18

I think I'd like to start off by addressing the very
19

question that Justice White asked, and that is, is there not
20

some justification for treating differently counties with
21

reserved land refuge from those counties which have acquired
22

land refuges?

And my answer to that is, no, there is no dif­

23

ference for treating those counties differently.

And I'll

24

explain why I believe that is the case, and perhaps with that
25

13

1

we can understand really why this case is here.
QUESTION:

2

Just by way of definition, to clarify it

3

for me at least, when you speak of the term "acquired lands,"

4

are those always lands which have been on the tax rolls before

5

they were acquired?
MR. CRANSTON:

6

Presumably so, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

I believe that certainly under the new Act, '78 amendment,

8

acquired lands are called fee lands, and those were lands which

9

were previously held in fee by private individuals and reac­

10

quired by the Government.

1 1

presumably they were taxed.
The reserved lands, on the other hand, were always

12
13

part of the public domain and were never taxed.
I think if you look at the Kenai Peninsula Borough

14

15
16

17

18
19

20

21

Thus, if they were held in fee,

itself we have a striking example of why the reserved land
county should be the recipient of these wildlife refuge reve­
nues.

In the case of Kenai there have been two million acres

withdrawn from the tax roll. Admittedly those lands were never
on the tax roll, but nevertheless two million acres of land
remain unavailable for the tax base of this borough.

If we

apply conservative property tax estimates , that will equal
anywhere from six to $10 million a year of tax revenues.

22

QUESTION:

Are you relating that to current rates

23

of tax in that area?
24

MR. CRANSTON:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I am.

25

14

I am

1

assuming a very low appraisal of $100 an acre and a very low

2

mill rate of from three to five mills, which is roughly within

3

the range of the current tax rate in that borough.

4

Now, considering the fact that this wildlife refuge

5

has development, oil and gas development, which requires ser­

6

vices such as fire protection, it of course increases the

7

population of the borough, schools, the development in essence

8

adds to the load on the borough to provide public services.

9

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Cranston, is that any different

10

than the situation of any other other western state that was

1 1

admitted to the Union, where the Federal Government started

12

out owning 70 or 80 percent of the land in the state?

13
14

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

22

MR. CRANSTON:

It could be, Justice Rehnquist, in

that I believe it's unusual in all of the public domain to
have development of that public domain, which adds to the
services which the local government must provide.

That is to

say, simply, if you have grazing on BLM grazing land, that
doesn't necessarily Increase the type of intensive use of the
land that requires additional services which normally are pro­
vided by the county's tax base.

And so I believe that in the

case of oil development, albeit on a wildlife refuge, there is
a legitimate reason for treating the county with a reserved
refuge the same as one with an acquired refuge, because the

23

net result is the same.

You have the development, you have

24

the increased population, you have the need to provide the
25

15

1

services, there is no difference in rationale as to why one

2

should be treated differently if you look at it from the

3

standpoint of the county and if you look at it from the revenue

4

obligation of the county, that is the threat to the county's

5

revenues and the threat to the county's tax base.
QUESTION:

6

But the county's tax base derives ulti­

7

mately from the authority of the Alaska Legislature, does it

8

not?
MR. CRANSTON:

9

That's correct, Your Honor.

But the

10

Alaska Legislature has permitted counties to tax land as well

1 1

as improvements, and it is certainly expected that when the

12

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20

land itself is taken out of the tax base, there certainly is
significant reduction in available tax revenue to the county.
That is, it may only then tax the improvements, and in the
case of an acquired refuge, the county, as in Plaquemines
Parish, Louisiana, is a good example, may tax both the land
and improvements and there is really no reason why one should
be treated any differently than the other.

And I think this

is what Congress recognized certainly in the 1964 amendment,
when if you read the statute, if one were asked to draft a
statute which gave authority to the Secretary to transmit

21

25 percent of reserved land refuges revenues to the counties,
22

and 25 percent of acquired land refuge revenues, you couldn't
23

come up with language any different from that which appears in
24

the Act.

And I believe Congress must have recognized the

25

16

1

similarity of result both as to acquired and as to reserved

2

land refuges.

3

started this argument, there is really no basis upon which to

4

distinguish between the two types.

Thus, again going to the question with which I

And I would also like to address the question which

5

6

Justice Rehnquist did ask early in this argument, is it not

7

close to a coin-toss as to how these.statutes should be inter­

8

preted?

9

no, it is not close to a coin-toss.

And again I would answer

that question by saying,
I think the Mineral

10

Leasing Act of 1920 and the Wildlife Refuge Sharing Act are

11

clearly inconsistent.

12

There has to be a choice, either the Mineral Leasing Act

13

applies, or the Wildlife Refuge Sharing Act applies.

14

Court on numerous occasions has stated, and most recently in

15
16
17

18
19

20

21
22

You can't have one and the other.

And this

SEC v. Sloan, that where there is a clear inconsistency between
the statutes involved, that apart from any express indication
of congressional intent, there is an implied repeal of at
least the inconsistent provisions.
Now, we certainly aren't saying that all of the
Mineral Leasing Act goes.

That of course is not the case.

But certainly those provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act
which allocate revenues between the counties and the Federal
Government must apply in this case, since otherwise you have

23
24

the clear inconsistency.
QUESTION:

You do concede that there is a general

25

17

1

policy against implied repeal, do you not?
MR. CRANSTON:

2

Certainly, Your Honor, and this Court

3

has recognized that many times, but the exception to that

4

policy against implied repeal is certainly

5

strongly by this case, where there is such a clear inconsis­

6

tency between those statutes, and given that inconsistency,

I believe that consistent with Sloan -QUESTION:

Mr. Cranston, how do you explain the

fact that apparently the change was drafted by the Department
of Interior as a perfecting amendment, and yet they didn't
apparently realize that the change meant what you now say it
means, for at least ten years?
MR. CRANSTON:

13
14

pointed out most

Certainly Interior in its early

letters, when this Act came before Congress in 1962, added
the word "minerals,”

and called it a perfecting amendment.

I think there are probably two answers to the question, Your
Honor.

One is that the amendment was simply recognizing what

had been at least the idea or the concept of Interior before
the 1964 amendment, and that's reflected in numerous memoranda
which are in the Appendix.

I won't refer them, but I think

20

they've been referred to in the briefs.
21

Secondly, I think it's fair to say that the effect
22

of the perfecting amendment did not filter down to those
23

individuals in the Fish and Wildlife Service, principally in
24

Alaska, people who were responsible for administering the law.
25

18

I think my only explanation can be that there was

1

2

an administrative oversight inconsistent with the statute and

3

certainly inconsistent with the desires of Congress.
QUESTION:

4

Well, is it not correct that your basic

5

position is that it was much more than a perfecting amendment,

6

it made a

MR. CRANSTON:

7

8

10
1 1

12
13
14

16
17

fundamental change?
It certainly made a change with

respect to ultimately how the revenues were to be distributed.
I would not concede that it made a fundamental change in the
overall statutory scheme, since before the 1964 amendment
there was certainly reason to believe that mineral revenues
could be distributed under the 1935 Act as provided in the
1964 Act.

That is, that simply it was -- just that.
QUESTION:

But the people who wrote the checks didn'v

think that.
MR. CRANSTON:
QUESTION:

I don't -- well --

And nobody complained for whenever it's

'55 or so, and if you want to add another ten years, then
18

MR. CRANSTON:

Certainly the people who wrote the

20

checks didn't follow the Act.

Now, what they thought, I

21

don't know, because -22

QUESTION:

I mean, I'm talking about the period

23

before 1964.
24

MR. CRANSTON:

Okay.

Certainly, before 1964 that's

25

19

1

true.

They did not think, or at least give expression to what

2

the Act could have permitted.

3

that there was never any explanation of why they did what they

4

did until 1975, and when it was first brought to the attention

5

of those people who could explain what was being done, the

6

explanation was consistent with both the position taken by

7

the Solicitor today and by the Kenai Peninsula Borough.

This is not the first time that the

Department of Interior has had a change in position from one
period to another, is it?

Or, perhaps I shouldn't put that to

you, since you're not responsible for the Department of
Interior.

But in the oil shale case we had exactly -MR. CRANSTON:

some barrier to that?

That is conceivably possible, Your

I just wonder why we're having to settle

that we have two inconsistent statutes and until that is done

ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. THOMAS KOESTER, ESO.,

14

17

Thank you very much for your time.

Alaska in this proceeding,
Alaska's position here is really quite straightfor­

20

ward.

the Moose Range leases, the leases on the Moose Range

21

with which we're dealing here, were issued under the authority
22

of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, and Section 35 of that Act
23

provides specifically that the revenues from leases issued
24

under the authority of the Act are to be distributed in a
25
:

23

1

certain fashion.

In Alaska those revenues are to be distribu­

2

ted 90 percent to the State and 10 percent to the Federal

3

Government.

4

the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act did not change the

5

scheme set out in the Mineral Leasing Act for distribution

6

of the revenues from the Kenai Range.

It is our position that the 1964 amendment to

7

Our position is based on an analysis, first, of the

8

policies underlying Section 35, on the legislative history of

9

10
1 1

the 1964 amendment, and on the administrative practice of the
Department of Interior with respect to the revenues received
from the Kenai Range.
Now, the policy underlying Section 35 of the

12
13
14

15
16
17

Mineral Leasing Act has been in effect since 1920, and that is
a policy by which Congress has determined it is appropriate to
share revenues from mineral exploitation of the public lands
in this country with the states in which those lands are lo­
cated.

That has been the policy since 1920.

It was recently

reaffirmed in the 1976 amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act.
18

The policy with respect to Alaska has been that
19

Alaska should receive a greater portion than the other states.
20

There are two reasons.

First, Alaska is not covered by the

21

Reclamation Act,

into which a significant portion of revenues

22

from public lands in other states is placed.

But more, impor­

23

tantly, as the legislative history cited in our brief with
24

respect to the Alaska Statehood Act demonstrates, Congress was
25

24

1

concerned when it conferred statehood on Alaska that there was

2

a very distorted land ownership pattern in the Territory of

3

Alaska.

4

In addition, significant portions of the public lands in

5

Alaska were withdrawn for purposes which Congress found, with­

6

drawals that Congress found were excessive.

7

Congress provided that 90 percent of the revenues from those

8

lands would be given to the State because these withdrawals

9

were hampering development in Alaska.

The Federal Government owned 99 percent of the land.

As a result,

This would include

10

public lands that were in the withdrawal status, if those

1 1

lands were leased for mineral exploitation, as the Kenai

12
13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20

Moose Range was.
In accordance with these policies underlying Section
35 of the Mineral Leasing Act, the Department of Interior dis­
tributed the oil and gas lease revenues from the Kenai Moose
Range pursuant to Section 35, from the date of statehood until
this question was asked by the Director of the Fish and Wild­
life Service in 1975.

So we have a practice from 1959 through

1975 unbroken, of these revenues being distributed pursuant
to Section 35.
The Director's 1975 question focused on an amendment

21

11 years earlier, in 1964, to the Wildlife Refuge Revenue
22

Sharing Act.

Now, the purpose of the 1964 amendment, it is

23

agreed by all parties, was to remove or eliminate opposition
24

on the part of states to the acquisition of land by the
25

25

1

Fish and Wildlife Service for wildlife refuges.

2

was that once these lands were acquired, they were taken off

3

the tax rolls, and that the existing provisions of the Wild­

4

life Refuge Revenue Sharing Act were inadequate to compensate

5

the local governments for the lost revenues.

6

The problem

Because the governor of an affected state could

7

block acquisition, the Fish and Wildlife Service found that it

8

was unable to acquire land because the counties were afraid

9

they were going to lose money.

10

11

12

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

Now, it should be noted that this issue has nothing
to do with public land revenues, it has nothing to do with
the congressional policy in Section 35.
revenues are to be shared with states.

The public land
Congress passed the

amendment changing the formula for distribution of revenues
from acquired lands and eliminated the obstacle to continued
land acquisition.

But at the same time it gave rise to the

Director's question in 1975 by adding the word "minerals" to
the list of revenue sources governed by the Refuge Revenue
Sharing Act.
Now, as has been mentioned, it was described in the

20

cover letter,this proposal to add the word "minerals" was
21

suggested by the Department of Interior, and was described
22

by the Interior Department as being a perfecting amendment,
23

not a substitute amendment, as you noted, Mr. Justice White.
24

Nor is the addition of the minerals mentioned anywhere in the
25

26

1

subsequent legislative history.
Now, in testifying on the proposed bill, we believe

2
3

it is significant that the Department of the Interior witnesses

4

stated that

5

als,'' would not affect the distribution of revenues from pub­

6

lic lands.

7

revenue distribution was under the existing law and that it

8

would be under the amendment If passed.

9

we believe, that revenues attributable to the Kenai Moose

10

1 1

12
13
14

15

In fact, they provided charts showing what the

It's significant,

range both In 1962 and in 1964 totalled less than $10,000.
At this time the oil and gas revenues from the Kenai Moose
exceeded $3-1/2 million.

And it is significant that those

oil and gas revenues were not included in the charts prepared
by the Department of Interior for the use of Congress addres­
sing this amendment.
The witnesses also testified that some oil and gas

16

17

this bill if passed, including the word "miner­

revenues currently were being distributed under the Wildlife
Refuge Revenue Sharing Act, but no additional oil and gas

18

revenues would be subjected to that distribution as a result
19

of this amendment.
20

Well, the Comptroller General had ruled in 1942 that
21

the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act did not reach oil and gas reve­
22

nues.

That was still the administrative interpretation by the

23

Comptroller General, charged with overseeing expenditures of
24

revenues received by the United States in 1964 when this
25

27

1

2

amendment was passed.
Oil and gas revenues from acquired lands were sub­

3

ject to the formula contained in the Refuge Revenue Sharing

4

Act but they were subjected to that formula by virtue of

5

Section 6 of the Mineral Leasing Act for acquired lands.

6
7

8
9

QUESTION:

The Kenai Moose Range was established in

'41, wasn't it?
MR. KOESTER:

Right.

And it was created out of

public lands, not acquired lands.

So, under the Comptroller

10

General's ruling, those revenues would not be governed by the

1 1

Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.

12
13
14

15
16
17

18
19

If the Kenai Moose Range had been

created out of acquired lands, they would have been governed
by the formula in the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act, but only
because Section 6 of the Mineral Leasing Act for acquired lands
directed that they be distributed in the formula in the same
way that non-mineral revenues from those acquired lands were
to be distributed.
Now, the Interior Department witnesses testified that
no new revenues would be subjected to the formula in the Refuge
Revenue Sharing Act by virtue of the amendment, and this was

20

true even though Congressmen were concerned at the time they
21

were considering this amendment that the revenues available to
22

the Department of Interior to make these payments to counties
23

It would seem that if Interior s

were going to be insufficient.
24

proposal to add the word "minerals" was to make the
25

28

1

Kenai Moose Range royalties subject to distribution under that

2

Act, that at this point they would have stepped forward and

3

said there should be no concern about the adequacy of reve­

4

nues, we're going to get $4 million a year more from the Kenai

5

National Moose range.

6

tended the word "minerals” to reach those revenues would have

7

said, well, we would be concerned, except that by adding the

8

word "minerals" we are making this $4 million annually avail­

9

able, which will eliminate any concern in this regard.

10
1 1

12

Or certainly, Congress, if it had in­

Now, following the passage of the amendment, the
Department of the Interior continued its pre-1964 practice of
distributing the Kenai Moose Range oil and gas revenues pur­
suant to Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act.
QUESTION:

Is this part of your argument directed

to your submission that the word "minerals" in this statute
does not include oil and gas?
MR. KOESTER:
QUESTION:

Well, I think perhaps --

The argument is made in your brief.

MR. KOESTER:

The argument is made in our brief.

The petitioners in this case have throughout maintained that
20

the plain meaning of the word "minerals" compels the conclu­
21

sion that the oil and gas revenues from Kenai National Moose
22

Range are subject to distribution under the Refuge Revenue
23

Sharing Act.

Well, Alaska's position has always been, and

24

still is, in fact, that this is not an appropriate case for
25

29

1

application of the plain meaning rule.

But you also have an argument that oil

and gas are not within the plain meaning of the statute.
MR. KOESTER:

I think what our argument is,

is that if this case is going to turn -QUESTION:

And I was wondering if you're directing

yourself to that argument now, or not?
MR. KOESTER:

If this -- no, I'm not, except in

response to your question.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. KOESTER:

If this case is to turn on the plain

meaning rule, then it must be resolved that Section 35 con­
trols, because Section 35 and the Mineral Leasing Act in
general speak specifically to oil and gas, whereas the word
"minerals" in many cases is construed to include oil and gas,
in some cases is construed not to include oil and gas, but in
any event requires construction.

It is not a plain meaning,

18

it is not susceptible to plain meaning construction, as in­
19

cluding oil and gas.

It requires a process of construction.

20

But our basic position is that this is not an appro­
21

priate case for the application of the plain meaning rule,
22

because we have two statutes involved, and even under a plain
23

meaning rule interpretation of the word "minerals" you're
24

still stuck with Section 35, which under its plain meaning
25

30

'

1

leads to an opposite result.

2

required here, and one must try to determine what Congress in­

3

tended .

4

So a process of construction is

Now, after Congress passed the 1964 amendment, and

5

added the word "minerals" to the statute, the Department of

6

Interior continued its pre-1964 practice of distributing these

7

revenues pursuant to Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act.

8

Now, this administrative practice was consistent, entirely

9

consistent, with the policy underlying Section 35 of the

10
1 1

12

13
14

15
16

17

Mineral Leasing Act, that is, to share public land revenues
with states.

It also was consistent with the congressional

policy with respect to public lands in Alaska, that Alaska
should receive 90 percent of those revenues, because of the
excessive number of withdrawals in Alaska.
And finally, it is consistent with the testimony of
the Department of Interior witnesses, when testifying before
Congress, that this amendment would have no effect on the
distribution of public land revenues, that it would not subject

18

additional oil and gas revenues to distribution under the
19

Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.
20

However, when the Director in 1975 asked his ques­
21

tion, whether this amendment 11 years earlier changed the
22

rules, the Solicitor of the Department of Interior and the
23

Comptroller General adopted the position which is now being
24

taken by the petitioners in this Court.
25

31

They rested their

1

2

conclusion on the plain meaning rule.
Now I believe that, as we have shown, the plain

3

meaning rule is inappropriate unless it is going to be used

4

to find that Section 35 controls.

5

more interesting at this point is the argument which has been

6

raised by the federal petitioners in their brief, and that

7

is somehow that in 1964 there was a perception that the

8

Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act controlled these revenues.

9

Now, under the Comptroller General's rulings it did not,

But what we believe is

10

but that there was somehow this perception on the part of

11

senior Department of the Interior officials, that this per­

12

13
14

15
16

17

18
19

ception was communicated to Congress -- although they concede
that it may possibly only have been communicated by inference
-- and that Congress may therefore have added the word
"minerals" based on this perception or understanding, and
the Court now should effectuate that presumed congressional
understanding by construing the word "minerals" to include
the oil and gas revenues from the public lands of the Kenai
National Moose Range.
We find that requires several assumptions before

20

you can get from Point A to Point B.

The first is that both

21

the Interior Department officials and Congress were unaware
22

of the Comptroller General's rulings.

The second is that they

23

were unaware that the Kenai Moose Range was generating $4
24

million a year in oil and gas revenues because their testimony
25

32

1

was, and the chart showed, the Kenai revenues were onlv

2

$10,000 a year.

3

The third is that they were unaware that Interior

4

was in a process of distributing these revenues under a

5

totally different statutory scheme, under Section 35 of the

6

Mineral Leasing Act.

7

that Interior continued to distribute these revenues in the

8

wrong way, or a way which was not perceived by the senior

9

officials of the Department of the Interior as being the pro­

10
1 1

12

13
14

15
16

17

18

And finally, as has been discussed,

per manner.
We submit that this chain of assumptions that must
be made before one reaches the result sought by the petitioners
simply is untenable.

It requires too much of a leap of fate.

We believe Justice Brennan's comment in the SEC v.

Sloan case

suggests a more appropriate assumption and that is that this
continuous process by which the Department of the Interior
distributed the revenues pursuant to Section 35 of the Mineral
Leasing Act more accurately reflects both the Department of
Interior's understanding and Congress's understanding.

19

If there is any doubt in this regard, one would
20

suggest that because the Secretary of the Interior -- the evi­
21

dence is that that the Secretary of the Interior gave the
22

directive to continue this practice.

So even if his senior

23

officials were confused, the Secretary wasn't.
24

QUESTION:

Well, the Secretary doesn't ordinarily

25

33

1

turn to the Comptroller General for legal advice, does he?
MR. KOESTER:

2

I don't believe so.

He turns to his

3

Solicitor for legal advice.

4

really is that no legal advice was necessary.

5

one understood that public land oil and gas revenues, whether

6

in wildlife refuges or not, were subject to distribution under

7

Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act.

8

necessary.

It was not necessary to get a formal opinion at

9

that time.

The Secretary simply said, continue the preexisting

10

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

So no legal advice was

Now, this construction -- that is, the construction
adopted by the Secretary of the Interior in 1966 and continued
until 1975 -- leaves intact without an implied amendment or
repeal the congressional policy regarding the sharing of
revenues under Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act, revenues
from public lands.

It also leaves intact the specific con­

gressional policy that revenues from public lands in Alaska
should be shared on a basis of 90 percent to Alaska and ten
percent to the Federal Government.
Now, in its reply brief and here today, Kenai -- and

20
21

In 1964 every­

practice, because there is no need to change it.

12

But here, I think, the issue

briefly alluded to by Mr. Claiborne -- discuss Alaska's
changed economics.

And as I'm sure the Court is aware, Alaska

22

now is enjoying rather large public revenues from state-owned
23

mineral lands.

However, this seems to me to be beside the

24

point.

Congress in 1964 could not foresee that Alaska would

it may or may not rise to the level of a compact, and I don't
believe that that issue really needs to be decided here, it
is certainly an issue that that will be -QUESTION:

And here we've mentioned --

Today, the Alaska Statehood Act, under

the quid pro quo.
MR. KOESTER:

12
13

In the lower courts we did.

Right.

We have mentioned the fact

that it is incorporated in the Statehood Act, and we've not
made a definitive argument on the parameters of the .statehood
compact, what it would require to change that statehood com­
pact.

And I think we recognize that there are legitimate

policy concerns under which Congress can deal with revenues
from public lands.

However, it is a very interesting question,

and particularly, given the policy considerations that Congress;
gave when it enacted statehood for Alaska to the distribution

20

of public land revenues, it certainly seems that at least if
21

there is going to be a change,

it

is

a change that must

22

be made by the legislature.
23

QUESTION:

Well, what about the distribution of the

24

revenues from non-oil and gas leases, or produce from reserved

lands in these refuges or -- ?
MR. KOESTER:

ity for those sales of surface resources stems from the

Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.

in dealing with mineral revenues in Alaska, revenues derived

7

under the Mineral Leasing Act, provided specifically that 90

8

percent of them were to go to the State.

9

make that provision with respect to non-mineral revenues.

10

And therefore the non-mineral revenues are subject to the

In other words, Congress

However, it did not

provisions of the Act which allows their sale in the first
place, in this case the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.
And as the charts in the legislative history show, the Kenai
Borough was receiving some of those revenues, even at that
time, albeit they were minimal compared to the oil and gas
revenues which were being derived.
Now, the judgments of the district court and the
court of appeals, we believe, reached an appropriate solution
to the dilemma here.

That is, to construe the word "minerals"

as reaching those from acquired lands, those on acquired lands,
20

but not reaching those on public lands.

Mr. Claiborne sug­

21

gests that this type of narrowing construction indulged by
22

the district court and the court of appeals is somewhat
23

unusual -- in fact, unique, I think, was the word he used.
24

However, this Court has done that very thing.
25

37

In United States

1

v. American Trucking Association, it narrowed the construction

2

of the word "employees," and in Train v.

3

Interest Group in 1976 it narrowed the term "radioactive

4

materials."

5

that with respect to one subclass contained within the general

6

term being construed Congress had definitively legislated there;

7

was a strong preexisting congressional scheme of regulation.

And that's precisely the case here.

since 1920 of distributing public land revenues under Section

10

13
14

15
16

17

18
19

And in both cases it was persuaded by the fact

There has been a policy

35 of the Mineral Leasing Act.
Now, Mr. Cranston has suggested that there is a

1 1

12

Colorado Public

problem here in that counties containing reserved lands do not
get these revenues while counties containing acquired lands
with oil and gas

development do.

In terms of the money,

direct revenue sharing to the counties, as the federal peti­
tioners point out in their brief, there were amendments in
1978 to the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act which authorized addi­
tional payments to counties containing reserved lands.
payments can be as much as 75 cents per acre.

Those

Or, in the

event that timber sales, material sales, gravel sales and so
20

on, exceed that amount, then they would get the higher figure.
21

So they get the largest amount available either under the
22

provisions of the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act or the 75 cents
23

per acre.
24

But I think, more significant is that in 1964 when
25

38

1

Interior was proposing that this word "minerals" be included,

2

the Interior Department felt that these oil and gas revenues

3

being shared with counties resulted in windfalls to the coun­

4

ties.

5

ceiving oil and gas revenues.

6

is that by adding the word "minerals" at the same time they

7

disavowed windfalls, they somehow have allowed counties con­

8

taining reserved public lands with oil and gas revenues to

9

obtain these very windfalls that were disavowed in 1964.

10

Interior was not at all pleased that counties were re­
And yet what is now suggested

Finally, the policy of the 1964 amendment, as I

1 1

mentioned, was to eliminate objection to the acquisition of

12

additional lands for wildlife refuges.

amendment, is construed,

If this statute, the

as changing the distribution formula

for oil and gas revenues from public lands, the very evil
sought to be remedied by that amendment would result in that,
certainly in the case of Alaska, the State would object to the
creation of additional wildlife ranges if in fact that would
change the revenue distribution from those lands.

And yet

that is what is asserted here.
We believe that this Court should not construe the

20

1964 amendment in a fashion which could result in the very
21

evil which was sought to be remedied by Congress, and yet that
22

would happen here.
23

QUESTION:

Mr. Koester, may I ask one question?

24

You refer in your brief to some charts or material in the 1964
25

39

legislative history which I have not looked at myself, which

2

suggest a breakdown of what revenues were being generated

3

and were not to be changed.

4

in that record that could

such as, say, it was stone or --

6

than oil and gas on the one hand, or things like sand and

7

gravel, which were previously mentioned in the statutes speci­

8

fically?
MR. KOESTER:

9

Was there any source of revenue
be

classified as a mineral revenue
something like that, other

The only things that I can recall are

10

in fact sand and gravel, and those were explicitly mentioned

1 1

in the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.

12
13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20

There is nothing

else that I can conceive of although I suppose -- and purely
speculating -- but if a wildlife refuge had a tourist shop and
they sold gold trinkets or something, perhaps that would be
included.

But again, that would be material not specifically

subject already to governance by a specific statute.

In other

words, the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 does not authorize the
leasing of land for gold extraction.

And so, to the extent

that the Department of Interior could sell gold trinkets or
nuggets that it found, or stones, or pebbles, or shells, that
authorization would come out of the Wildlife Refuge Revenue

21

Sharing Act, and the terms of that Act would then apply.
22

But we're

not dealing with that here, we're dealing

23

with oil and gas, which was already governed by Section 35 of
24

the Mineral Leasing Act.
25

40

1

For the policy reasons underlying Section 35 of the

2

Mineral Leasing Act and the legislative history underlying the

3

1964 amendment, as well as the administrative practice of

4

the Department of Interior for 11 years following that amend­

5

ment, we believe this Court should affirm the decisions of the

6

district court and the court of appeals.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Claiborne, you have

about two minutes left.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS,
CECIL D. ANDRUS, ETAL. -- REBUTTAL
MR. CLAIBORNE:

First, in answer to the question

asked by Mr. Justice Stevens, I draw the Justice's attention
to the Appendix to our brief at page 2a.

This is a part of

the affidavit of the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service,
Paragraph 3 of that affidavit indicates that the mineral reve­
nues generated by all wildlife refuges consists entirely of

18

oil and gas revenues.

That apparently has always been true and

19

is true as of the date of this affidavit.
20

QUESTION:

That can't be entirely true because

21

weren't there sand and gravel sales?
22

MR. CLAIBORNE:

I take it the word "mineral" here is

23

used as meaning mineral other than sand and gravel specified
24

in the Wildlife Revenue Sharing Act, though I don't for a fact
25

41

1

know that there was any such revenue even though it's speci­

2

fied .

gravel revenue?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

19

It would be enormous --

I think it would be your interest.
The enormous difference is it goes

between the 90 percent and the 25 percent, whoever it goes to
in Alaska.

I would add that it is a case which is entirely

appropriate for Congress, the national Congress, to resolve,
but it has declined the invitation to do so when the matter
was very clearly put before it in -QUESTION:

Mr. Justice White suggested

9

12

Indeed.

that the Alaska Legislature could resolve this case.

7

YOu mean, that there was any sand and

Well, you wouldn't suggest that the

Alaska Legislature would be disentitled if you won this case
to take the 25 percent that would go to the county?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I suppose the duty of the Secretary

20

would be to pay to the county.

Whether the county was then

21

required by Alaska law to turn it over -22

QUESTION:

You probably don't even have an opinion

23

on that.
24

MR. CLAIBORNE:

It would not be our concern; that

25

42

1

is so.

But I do think the Secretary must first obey the

2

federal law and pay it to the county --

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

4

MR. CLAIBORNE:

-- whatever the cdunty is then re­

5

quired to do.

6

Court ought to take is that Congress ought to be held to its

7

word if the consequences of what it wrote or not, as it in­

8

tended it, and we think they probably are, then Congress has

9

an easy opportunity to amend the Act.

But this Court ought

not torture the text to guess what Congress may or may not
have been doing in changing or not changing the law In 1964.
QUESTION:

Does the word "mineral" or does the

addition of the word -- would the addition of the word "mineral
have any meaning whatsoever if the State wins this case?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

It would accomplish precisely

nothing because it would simply confirm the formula already
enacted by the Mineral Leasing Act -QUESTION:

Would it affect, would it add something,

18
19

would it change the distribution of any other -- ?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Nothing whatever, Mr. Justice White.

20

QUESTION:

Mineral besides oil and gas?

21

MR. CLAIBORNE:

It would be entirely surplusage,

22

unless it applies to reserved lands.

Because at least all

23

minerals covered by the Minerals Leasing Act for acquired lands
24

in 1947, or by that Act, required to be distributed under the
25

43

1

Refuge Act formula -- now -- gold and silver might present a

2

separate question.

3

QUESTION:

Well, so you answer yes, if there were

4

gold and silver discovered, the word "minerals" would have

5

some meaning besides oil and gas?

6

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Yes.

Theugh no one, in the '64 --

7

or '62 debates, ever suggested that there was gold and silver

8

to be found on this refuge.

9

was oil and gas, and everyone knew that the word "mineral"

10
1 1

12

13
14

The only mineral ever spoken of

In that context meant oil and gas.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:17 o'clock a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
