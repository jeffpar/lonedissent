MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll hear argument next

Mr. Eastman, I think you may proceed when you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD D. EASTMAN, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. EASTMAN:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The facts in the case, in this case, are relatively

10
1 1

simple.

12

may vote in the presidential preference primary of any party

13

he or she chooses without regard for the voter's affiliation

14

or any declarations of support for the party.

15

Party, in contrast, has for years believed that only democrats

16

should participate in this process of selecting its candidates.

17

Under the Wisconsin Primary Election Statute, a voter

The Democratic

Over the years, since the party reform effort began in 1968,
%

19

20
21

22
23
24

the party has developed a rule implementing that principle.
The rule provides that only publicly declared democrats may
participate in the processes of selecting the democratic nominee
And that is true whether those processes

are a primary, a cau­

cus or a convention system.
QUE-STION:

Mr. Eastman, I take it we have to deal here

with the Article II, Section 1 provision, each state shall
appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof shall direct

25

3

1

a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and

2

representatives to which the state may be entitled.

3

the Wisconsin legislature had simply provided that 13 or 14

4

people should be the electors to the electoral college in

5

December, 1980, in Washington, in

6
7

MR. EASTMAN:
could do that.

this particular election?

I think the

— I don't believe they

But I believe the --

QUESTION:

Well, why don't you believe they could do

that ?
MR. EASTMAN:

10
11

What if

Well I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

the question -QUESTION:

12

It's a --

MR. EASTMAN:

13

-- the question is not who the electors

f

14

would be in the electoral college; the question is, who will

15

be the delegates to the Democratic National Convention.

16

there's a slight difference of opinion, or at least, difference

17

of emphasis between the two Appellees, as to what exactly is

18

the state's authority to enact a statute regulating the pri­

19

maries of major political parties; that is, that the process

20

by which the delegates for the national convention are chosen.

21

But it may not be Article II.

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Now

The statute speaks in terms of appoint,

not regulate the selection of -- well, what if the state just
decided to dispense with any sort of intervening elections or
caucuses or anything else and said, we hereby appoint John Doe,

MR. EASTMAN:

3

to the electora

Well I had a sense that there are a

4

number of decisions of this Court that would probably preclude

5

that.

It might well be a denial of the federal right to vote QUESTION:

6
7

state could do precisely that, couldn't it?
MR. EASTMAN:

12

QUESTION:

15

16

17

18

And just sort of be completely oblivious

to the Republican and Democratic conventions

and to their

nominees.
MR. EASTMAN:

13

14

I think as far as the Constitution's

literal language, that's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

10

1 1

Well as far as the Constitution goes, the

Stewart.

That might be possible, Mr. Justice

I don't think -QUESTION:

As far as the Constitution goes.

MR. EASTMAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Because the state hasn't done anything

like that, has it?
MR. EASTMAN:

Well I think that's correct, absolutely

19

It's not the case here.

The fact of the matter is the state

20

has enacted primary election statutes and whether it has done
21

so pursuant to its Article II power or whether its enactment of
22

primary statutes is pursuant to some other power, the

fact

23

of the matter is now that it's legislated, it can only act
24

within the confines of the Bill of Rights.

I thought I did, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. EASTMAN:

18

would likewise

I don't think it would, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, because it wouldn't be dictating to the democratic

party how it conducted its convention and which delegates it

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Eastman, how many states do you know

have open primaries today?

7

MR. EASTMAN:

There are only two, Mr. Justice Black-

8

mun; the state of Wisconsin and the state of Michigan.

Now

9

the state of Montana has come before the Court as an amicus and

10

claimed that it has an open primary.

12

cated that they do have an open primary.

13

primary but it's not binding on the delegates.

14

that, it's really not -- that the primary statute wouldn't be

15

affected by this case.
QUESTION:

16

I must say I don't read

They have an open
And because of

Well does your proposal -- what does your

17

proposal involve; someone declares his party affiliation as he

18

comes into the polling place, is that sufficient?
MR. EASTMAN:

19

21

rule.

The national rule, Rule 2(a), requires a public declara­

tion of affiliation.
QUESTION:

22
23
24
25

That's sufficient under the national

democratic

And then what do you do, hand him a

ballot, or a republican whatever-it-is that he

declares ?
MR. EASTMAN:

The details of voting are left to the
7

1

state party and to state law, and it varies from state to state.

2

In some states, the voter is handed a democratic ballot; in some

3

states, he goes into the voting booth and makes his selection

4

after having declared, after he made the declaration outside

5

the voting booth.

QUESTION:

MR. EASTMAN:

QUESTION:

9

So that he can't cross over in the -No.

If it's machine voting, he might cross

over after he gets into the cubicle.
MR. EASTMAN:

No.

The state party would have to make

11

arrangements to ensure that he had made his declaration and

12

voted
QUE STION:

13
14

And then --such as separate voting mach­

ines for each party?
MR. EASTMAN:

15

Separate voting machines or blocking

16

17

party --

5

MR. EASTMAN:

8

QUESTION:

Well that's on the theory that the primary

is a substitute for the party convention, historically, is it
not?
MR. EASTMAN:

I think that's generally the correct

history

11

12

29 states and the District

of Columbia have closed primaries and --

9
10

It's simpler, but there are numerous

states that have closed primaries.

And it's a lot simpler with an open primary than it

QUESTION:

Quasi-private or quasi-public.

It isn't

like an election in that sense.

13

MR. EASTMAN:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

The

14

end of the exercise is not the election of a public official,

15

the end of the exercise is the selection of delegates to a

16

national convention who are committed to vote for particular

17

nominees.
QUESTION:

18

Mr. Eastman, do you contend the Wisconsin

19

statute is unconstitutional, or merely that the national party

20

need not seat delegates selected

MR. EASTMAN:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I think the latter

is closer to our position.
QUESTION:

pursuant

In other words, --

That's what I understand it to be, and if

so, is it a proper appeal?
9

1

MR. EASTMAN:

I think it's a proper appeal because the

2

Wisconsin statute, as applied by the Wisconsin Supreme Court
3

and, I think, the Wisconsin Supreme Court's order was faithful
4

to the statute's requirements, not an opinion, but the order.
5

QUESTION:

I see.

6

MR. EASTMAN:

I think that the statute as applied to the

7

Democratic

party is unconstitutional.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

1:00 o'clock, counsel.

(Lunch recess)

1 1

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

MR. EASTMAN:

16
17

Counsel, you may continue.

Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the

Court:

14
15

We will resume there at

The order of the Wisconsin Court effectively requires
the party to seek delegates chosen in accordance with the
open

primary statute and in conflict with the party's

determination about who ought to participate in this process.

18

This is not a case,

19

the Wisconsin statute or the Court's order says to the party,

20

if you want to use our electoral machinery, our election mach­

21

inery, you must permit -- you must permit non-Democrats to

22

participate in the primary process.

23

this is not a case where the statute, where

There is a case instead where the state is attempting

24

to dictate to the party and to the party's convention which

25

delegates it has to seat. '
10

1

QUESTION:

What do you think the Supreme Court of

2

Wisconsin would have done had the national party failed to

3

comply?

Would they have held the people in contempt?

4

MR. EASTMAN:

I believe so.

The Wisconsin court order

5

actually was a declaration.

6

had already taken steps to obtain an injunction in New York

7

where the convention was held, had that been necessary.

8

I think they would have probably held -- the national party and

9

the Democratic National Committee were respondents

The Attorney General of Wisconsin

So yes,

in the

10

original action in the Wisconsin Supreme Court and I presume,

1 1

would have been held in contempt had that -- had the democratic

12

party violated the order.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Eastman, may I pursue that subject a

14

moment?

15

the situation when the convention arrived would have been much

16

as it was in fact, because the order was stayed, if I remember

17

correctly.

18
19

20
21

22

If this litigation had never been brought, I suppose

MR. EASTMAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And the National Committee went ahead and

seated the delegates anyway.
MR. EASTMAN:
QUESTION:

It did so, Justice Stevens.

Does the National Committee really have

much interest in the issue?

I understand they want to be out,

23

free of an order, compelling them to seat them.

But supposing

24

the litigation had never been brought, presumably they would hav
25

11

1

just gone ahead and seated the delegates.

2

MR. EASTMAN:

I don't think that's correct, Justice

3

Stevens.

4

that the National Party would have run an alternate delegate

5

selection system, or, hopefully with the cooperation of the

6

state party, and a different slate of delegates would have been

7

seated.

8

was unfortunately and regrettably not in a position to run an

9

alternate delegate selection system, partly because there wasn't

Had the litigation never been brought, I believe

The National Party, at the time the stay was issued

10

sufficient time and partly because the DNC didn't have the

11

resources to do it.

12

QUESTION:

13

14

15

16

Right, yes.

You don't contend that there's

anything-unconstitutional about the Wisconsin statute, do you?
MR. EASTMAN:

It's -- we contend that the Wisconsin

statute is unconstitutional -QUESTION:

Well, if you'Ye ordered to comply with it,

17

suppose -- if you're ordered to comply with it, now we covered

18

that before lunch, that's unconstitutional under your view.

19

But supposing they just have a statute, say well

25

we're going

to elect people in this fashion and the National Committee can
take our delegates or leave them, as it chooses.
MR. EASTMAN:

There would be nothing unconstitutional

about that sort of statute.

Well why -- tell me why

MR. EASTMAN:

convention; the order has continuing effect and would continue

And it has happened on occasion.

But that’s a

We don't anticipate it happening --

Wouldn't it be rare for delegates not

MR. EASTMAN:

It's rare for delegates not to be

the National Party's

10
11
12

QUESTION:

rules for selecting the delegates.
Well, if you're not attacking the statute

on its face, so to speak, why isn't this case moot?
MR. EASTMAN:

The case is not moot because the Wis­

13

consin Court's order, which I think faithfully reflects the

14

Wisconsin statute as applied to the Democratic party, continues

15

why you back off from saying your claim is that the statute,
that the open primary is unconstitutional.

MR. EASTMAN:

I didn't -- if I appeared to back off

it, I didn't mean to, Mr. Justice White.
QUESTION:

3

I think --

Well I thought you just said that except

for this order there's nothing wrong with an open primary

5

statute.
MR. EASTMAN:

6
7

I hope I didn't say that.

What I said

was --

8

QUESTION:

It was --

9

MR. EASTMAN:

-- there's nothing wrong with an open

10

primary statute as applied to another political party, spe­

11

cifically, for example, the Republican party which has no objec­

12

tion to a -- an open primary.

13

QUESTION:

14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22

So you are saying this statute is unconsti­

tutional in the face of a contrary party rule?
MR. EASTMAN:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

Well why can't the Democrats simply set

up their own machinery for choosing delegates in Wisconsin and
outside of the state system and in full compliance with the
National Democratic

standards and send them to the Democratic

National committee, then?
MR. EASTMAN:

Justice Rehnquist, the Wisconsin Court

did not leave us that option. The Wisconsin Court, effectively
lirects the party to seat delegates selected in accordance with

23

the open primary and not by some other process.

Now the order

24

stated as if it were a negative order, but the net effect of it
25

16

1

2

is that it requires the parties to seat and -QUESTION:

And you said the Wisconsin -- you say the

3

Wisconsin Court has no jurisdiction whatever to tell the Demo­

4

cratic party what standard should be followed for seating

5

delegates to its convention?

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. EASTMAN:

Or, and the state has no power?
The state has no power, because when,

8

if it tries to do so, it violates the parties' First and Four­

9

teenth Amendment rights.

10
11

12

QUESTION:

It's made the final order here, though.

It's a court which has made the final order.
QUESTION:

And yet you concede that the state legis­

13

lature under the constitution can specify who the delegates to

14

any -- to who the electors may be.

15

QUESTION:

That's quite different.

16

MR. EASTMAN:

I believe that's quite different,

Justice Rehnquist.

18

electors, that does not mean that the state could nonetheless

19

specify the delegates to the National Party's convention

20

because even if Wisconsin chose that scheme, the National Party

21

would still hold a convention to produce a nominee to run for

22

president, president of the entire United States, and those

23

delegates, the delegates from Wisconsin would still reflect

24

a set of rules for selecting delegates that was inconsistent

Even if the state had specified the

with the party's rule.
17

1

QUESTION:

I think what your position must be, that

2

the state of Wisconsin through its courts or legislature, has

3

no more authority to tell the Democratic Party which delegates

4

should be seated than it would with the Moose Lodge or the

5

Knight's of Columbus?

6

MR. EASTMAN:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

Well but are you saying that the Democratic:

8

National Committee's action in various aspects is not "state

9

action"?

10

MR. EASTMAN:

The question of whether and under

11

what circumstances the Democratic parties' action -- state

12

action is not presented by the case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

13

QUESTION:

In answer to the Chief Justice's question,

14

you say it's just like the Moose Lodge

QUESTION:

Has it been known, Mr. Attorney General,

or at least has it been thought and said that sometimes the

MR. LA FOLLETTE:

Your Honor, the record which has

We are not talking about a process under state

Buckley v. Valeo which is, we feel, much more in point as far

19

as the constitutional issues that are involved in this case.

20

Where this Court recognized that in the question of disclosure

21

22

butions to candidates in political parties will deter some

23

individuals who otherwise might contribute.

We feel that the minimum intrusion by the

Court order in this -- in the Court below, has -- certainly
does not rise to the test that this Court has applied that it's
necessary that the Appellants here have the burden to show

5

that they have been substantially interfered with in their

associational rights.

QUESTION:

I don’t believe, General La Follette,

8

that it appears in the record, but wasn't one of the great

9

battles after the English or formats of the 19th Century, where

10

they had enfranchised people to obtain a secret ballot because

11

the landlord simply stood at the polling place and if the

12

person had to declare himself openly and orally it was just about

13

like being disenfranchised.

14

MR. LA FOLLETTE:

It is a matter of disenfranchisemen(t

15

And I would also point out the Wisconsin open primary is held

16

in conjunction with the spring election on the same day in

17

Wisconsin in which literally thousands of our locally elected

18

officials, our judiciary, our mayors, our city councilmen, our

19

town board members, are all elected on the same day in a non­

20

partisan election.

21

and force people who want to vote in these elections to declare

22

their party allegiance would certainly frustrate the very sub­

23

stantial purpose in Wisconsin's electoral process.

QUESTION:

is a public action that is taking place and that there would
be a certain amount of retreat from that if we could say that
this reform measure at the turn of the century from Wisconsin
which outlawed the very thing that the National Party wanted
to superimpose in Wisconsin -- the very thing that was done in
Michigan.

In Michigan, the Attorney General declared that

their open primary statute was unconstitutional and the whole

process was displaced with a party caucus where there were fees

13

to be paid and as a result, only 15,000 people determined the

QUESTION:

Mr. Friebert, why couldn't the state

interest you described be adequately protected by a statute

that said whoever the delegates are they shall vote, at least

on the first ballot or on the second ballot, for the presiden­

10

tial candidate who receives the largest vote in the primary?

1 1

MR. FRIEBERT:

That's a choice that the Wisconsin

12

statute gives; a winner take all statute.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

21

MR. EASTMAN:

22

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't feel the

23

need to say anything further, but I'm prepared to answer ques­

24

tions .

25

QUESTION:

Let me just ask this one question.
40

1

Supposing the Wisconsin statute divided by districts, says that

2

the person-- the presidential candidate who receives the most

3

votes in a given delegate district, however they are appor­

4

tioned, shall be the candidate for whom the delegates from

Wisconsin shall vote.

the people that represent the majority.

In other words, you could pick the

MR. EASTMAN:

Would that comply

No, it would not, so long as the primary

was an open primary and non-Democrats -QUESTION:

So the open primary objective is not

12

merely the selection of delegates but also the determination

13

of the person for whom they might vote?

14

MR. EASTMAN:

Absolutely, Justice Stevens.

The

15

heart of this case is the process of selecting the nominee,

16

not merely delegates who are bound to hold their hands up to

17

cast a predetermined vote.

18

the delegates functions are mightily affected by the candidate

19

apportioning, because the candidate gets a certain number of

20

members on the credentials committee, a certain number on the

21

platform committee and a certain number on the --

25

QUESTION:

Although I might add, actually

Mr. Eastman, the Wisconsin delegation was

in fact, seated last summer, was it not?
MR. EASTMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it was, Justice Stewart.

Again --

Although there was a stay of the -- of
41

1

the Wisconsin Supreme Court's order, was there not?
2

MR. EASTMAN:

Yes.

And the party very much appre­

3

ciated being able to -- the Court's stay, which was issued
4

sua sponte, and having the ability to make that decision free
5

of the compulsion of the Wisconsin Court's order, there simply
6

wasn't enough time left or really the resources, unfortunately,
7

for the party to go out and run an alternate delegate selection
8

system, the National Party, without the cooperation of the
9

State Party.
10

11

QUESTION:

least there was no other delegation?

12

13

MR. EASTMAN:

QUESTION:

15

17

That there was no other delegation,

it was impractical for us to try to create one.

14

16

So there's really no alternative, at

And why isn't this moot?

MR. EASTMAN:

It isn't moot for several reasons.

First, the Wisconsin Court order as I mentioned has continuing
effect.

Secondly, the issue is not onTy capable of repetition

18

but it's almost virtually certain to be repeated, because I—

19

there's -- I see no evidence that 'Wisconsin is going to change

20

its statute and I see very, very strong evidence that the

21

Democratic Party is not going to change its democrats only

22

rule.

23

if the case doesn't -- the issue will almost certainly evade

24

review if the Court doesn't decide it now, because by the time

25

the controversy arises, in the nature of the process of

And furthermore, it will almost certainly evade review

42

1

approving delegate selection plans and so on before the con­

2

vention, the controversy won't really arise as it didn't this

3

time, until about eight months before the Wisconsin primary

4

election which is held in April, and about a year before the

5

convention, as was the case this time, and that simply isn't

6

enough time to get a conclusive final adjudication of the

7

constitutional issues which have been raised here.
QUESTION:

8
9

Mr. Eastman, would you say that, that

the state of Wisconsin is constitutionally prohibited from

10

legislating, allowing a closed primary as you want, the declar­

11

ation of the Democratic loyalty, but saying that delegates from

12

the Fourth and Fifth, votes from the Fourth and Fifth Districts

13

shall be counted as electing so many delegates; in other words,

14

having a congressional district apportionment?
MR. EASTMAN:

15

If I understand your hypothesis to be

16

that the issue would not be necessarily closed versus open

17

primary --

18

19

20
21

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. EASTMAN:
QUESTION:

-- but the apportionment of delegates -

Right.

MR. EASTMAN:

-- yes, apportionment of delegates

selected from the state, but actually selected to -- by the
State Party to be at the convention, yes, I would say that the
Democratic National Convention and the Democratic Party could
decide on the apportionment of delegates from the state on the
43

1

method of apportionment, and that if the state mandated a
2

different one, the state could not constitutionally enforce
3

that different allocation.

MR. EASTMAN:

tion both ways?

MR. EASTMAN:

11

12

I think that's correct.

that the Democratic Party --

9

Even if the state said apportion accord­

QUESTION:

Yes.

Now the Democratic Party has rules, does

it not, requiring that state delegations be representative of

13

various, or have certain quotas of various age groups and

14

genders and --there being only two genders -- and

15

diverse

be racially

in some of them, does it not?

16

MR. EASTMAN:

It has guidelines to provide certain

17

affirmative action steps and in fact, it did require this year

18

that 50 percent of the delegates are women.

19

QUESTION:

So that if a state law should say, men onl^

20

for example, or people only over 35, or something like that,

21

that would also in your view be unconstitutional because it

22

would impair your constitutional right of free association?
MR. EASTMAN:

23

So long as there was a contrary party

24

rule, yes.

Now I'm not addressing -- I'm not addressing if

25

it would be a -- there may well be other constitutional

constraints on the Democratic Party's choices and that gets

whether certain individuals can be precluded, but

QUESTION:

You do adhere to the view that if the

Wisconsin legislature says half of the population of the state
lives in the lake shore counties and half of the population
lives in the other half of the state, then half of the dele­

10

gates shall be elected by the lake shore county closed declared

1 1

Democrats and half shall be elected by the other declared

12

Democrats ?

13

MR. EASTMAN:

That is our view, Mr. Justice Rehn-

14

quist, and in fact, that very issue was brought up in the

15

context of the Republican Party's allocation of its delegates

16

in certain states, in a case decided by the D.C. Circuit not

17

long ago, the Ripon case, which is cited in the briefs.

18

the D.C. Circuit said that the State Party -- that the Repub­

19

lican Party had a right to determine its own apportionment.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. EASTMAN:

22

QUESTION:

And

It wasn't a state action?
No, it wasn't quite the same thing.

Mr. Eastman, do you -- so if this injunc­

23

tion order were revoked at this time, you would say there's

24

still a case or controversy here that should be decided? If

I believe that the Wisconsin

position if the Democratic Party rule said no delegate shall
be seated unless his loyalty to the Democratic Party shall be
certified by the state chairman?
MR. EASTMAN: While I can’t imagine the Democratic
Party adopting that rule, I would take the same position.
