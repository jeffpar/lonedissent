MR. WCORTHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The issue in this case is whether meals and lodging
furnished withoiut charge to employees solely for the convenience
of the employer are wages subject to social security, that is,
FICA and FUTA t/axes.

The court below said yes.

We think that

in light of this Court's decision in Central Illinois Public
Service Company in 1978, emphasizing that wages is a narrowly
defined term, miuch narrower than income, the legislative history

15

of social security and income tax withholding indicating that
16

Congress intended that the same wage base, the same exact tax
17

base of wages with the same definition, be used for all employ­
18

ment tax purposes,

and the 60-year history of rulings, regula­

19

tions, and cases that meals and lodging for the convenience of
20

the employer are not income, the answer is clearly that they
21

are not subject to tax.
22

The essential facts are undisputed.

The petitioner

23

operates oil ancd gas drilling rigs up to 60 miles offshore,
24

with crews of up to a dozen people.

Because it's too costly

That's in the record, Your Honor.

Yes, sir.

That cost?

The figure is --

How does it relate --

15

MR. WORTHY:

$275 to $350 per crew per trip, which

16

breaks down to about $25 to $29 per man, with a 12-man crew
17

as compared to about: $6 a day for furnishing food and lodging
18

aboard the rig.

A little bit more than the food.

MR. WORTHY:

Unless they are awfully hungry, but I

2

believe it's been stipulated that the value of the food and

3

lodging is $6 per man per day, as compared to the $29 cost per

4

man per day to transport them back and forth to shore.

And as

crew went ashore

and for five days off when a new crew came aboard.

And so

lodging was furnished aboard with three meals a day, cafeteria
style, at petitioner's expense, to each crew member during the
time he remained aboard.
Now, when he was aboard, off duty, a member of a crew

n

was not expected to perform any services.

There was no agree­

12
13

ment to furnish the food or lodging, and there was no cash
allowance if meals or lodging were refused, and the petitioner

14

had no obligation to transport the crew members back ashore at
15

the end of each shift,

the only obligation being at the end

16

of the 10-day shift.
17

QUESTION:

I realize this hypothetical example is

18

vastly different factually.

But is it much different in prin­

19

ciple from a household which employs a housekeeper to come In
20

one day a week and, for their convenience or for her convenience
21

furnishes her lunch?
22

MR. WORTHY:

I don't think it's any difference in

23

principle, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, however, I should say in
24

candor -25

QUESTION:

In that case, perhaps the Members of the

2

Court are -- perhaps you don’t have a court here, because I'd

3

venture to guess that most if not all of the Members of the

4

Court have such household employees, at least part-time.
MR. WORTHY:

5

I should say, in all candor, Mr. Justice

6

Stewart and Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that by statute the meals

7

and lodging furnished to household employees are exempt. -

8

I don’t think the principle is any different, but the exemption

9

is provided by statute in the case of domestic employees.
QUESTION:

10

MR. WORTHY:

11
12
13
14

that.

By statute.
I think I should be perfectly fair about

Now, no meals or lodging were provided to the crew mem­

bers during their off duty days and they had to obtain meals
and lodging, and maintain regular lodging ashore

for their

use during the five days they were off duty at their own expense.
15

And the Court should know that in addition to the offshore rigs,
16

the petitioner also operated land-based rigs.

Land-based crews

17

were paid substantially the same cash wages as the offshore
18

crews but the land-based crews went home every night and they
19

were not furnished any meals or lodging at the petitioner’s
20

expense.
21

Now, the Government admits that the meals and lodging
22

were provided as a result of a unilateral decision by petitioner
23

based on its own economic reasons and that since they were fur­
24

nished for the convenience of the taxpayer as an employer, they

are not wages subject to income tax withholding.

QUESTION:

MR. WORTHY:

4

They are not subject to; they are not

wages subject to income tax.
QUESTION:

5
6

They are not subject to --

The employees don't have to include these

for income tax purposes?
MR. WORTHY:

7

That's correct, sir, but not only that,

8

but more significantly they are not within the definition of

9

wages for income tax withholding purposes, the income tax

10

withholding being one of the four employment taxes imposed.
QUESTION:

11
12
13

But the reason -- is that the reason for

that, since they're not subject to tax?

Why wouldn't you

withhold?
MR. WORTHY:

14

No, sir.

It's been established since

at least 1919 in all the rulings and regulations and cases
15

which were reviewed very thoroughly by this Court in the
16

Kowalski case just four years ago, that meals and lodging for
17

the convenience of the employer have consistently been held not
18

to be income, even though the statute defined income to include
19

wages.

And that's been the rule established --

20

QUESTION:

My question was --

21

MR. WORTHY:

— for the last 62 years.

22

QUESTION:

No, but isn't it logical, if they're not to

23

be included as income for tax purposes, you wouldn't include
24

them for withholding purposes, would you?

1

MR. WORTHY:

Certainly that's logical, Mr. Justice

2

Brennan.

3

Illinois case, just two years ago, this Court held that meal

4

reimbursements were subject to income tax.

5

not subject to withholding tax, simply because they were not

6

wages, and income tax withholding is imposed on wages, which

7

as this Court pointed out in that case is a much narrower term

8

than income.

However, I should point out that in the Central

However, they were

Now, aside from income tax withholding, the other
three employment taxes are an employee income tax under the
Social Security Act or FICA, which is also subject to withhold­
ing; an excise tax on employers under the Social Security Act
or FICA, in the identical amount; and Federal Unemployment
Insurance Tax on employers or FUTA.

Now, all four of these

14
taxes, the income tax withholding and the three social security
15
taxes, are imposed on wages.

And as acknowledged by the court

16
below and by the Government, wages are defined for all four
17
employment tax purposes in essentially identical terms, as all
18
remuneration for services or employment.

And as I've sug­

19
gested, for over 60 -- yes, sir?
20

QUESTION:

You say there are four, and that's repeatec

21

in the briefs, and I'm sure there are, but I count only three,
22

the income taxes and FICA and FUTA.
23
MR. WORTHY:

Well, FICA consists of two taxes.

24
QUESTION:

I see.

25

GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

MR. WORTHY:

There's one tax which is by statute an

2

income tax, which is highly significant; it's a tax on income

3

limited to the wages of employees, which is withheld by the

4

employer; and a tax in an additional amount -- the first tax is

5

borne by the employee through the withholding system.

6

second FICA tax is on the employer, borne by the employer and

paid by the employer.

identical amount.

which is borne entirely by the employer.

MR. WORTHY:

Since there are two FICAs -There are two FICAs.

fusing, Your Honor, but -QUESTION:

And the third social security tax is FUTA,

QUESTION:

10

The

Isn't it fairly common for, say, again,

an employer of a domestic to agree to pay the domestic's share
of the narrower wage?

15

MR. WORTHY:

Yes, sir, it is common, and the Service

16

has ruled that the employer can do so without that additional
17

tax being counted as wages as a part of the tax base.
18

Now, as I previously indicated, for 62 years meals
19

and lodging furnished employees for the convenience of the
20

employer have been recognized as not being remuneration for
21

services, and therefore not income for income tax purposes,
22

even though the revenue acts from 1918 on repeatedly defined
23

income as including wages of whatever kind and in whatever
24
form paid.
25

1

Thus, although the Government in its briefs only talks

2

about codification of the convenience of the employer rule in

3

1954, in Section 119, it was well understood that wages did not

4

include meals and lodging for the convenience of the employer

5

when the social security taxes were enacted in 1935.

6

reason, as pointed out by this Court in reviewing the cases

7

and rulings in Kowalski four years ago, is that such items

8

simply are not compensation for services and hence not income.

9
10

11
12
13
14

And the

Income tax withholding came in in 1942, requiring
employers to withhold income tax on wages paid their employees.
The Service almost immediately Issued Regulation 115 which, if
I may quote, "provides that if living quarters or meals are
furnished to an employee for the convenience of the employer,
the value thereof need not be included as wages subject to
withholding."

Now, this contemporaneous interpretation of the

15

income tax withholding statute is highly significant because
16

this was long before codification of the convenience rule in
17

Section 119 and it's significant because of the legislative
18

history of the income tax withholding, in which Congress ex­
19

pressed a clear and specific intent to adopt as a definitional
20

base for income tax withholding exactly the identical base pre­
21

viously adopted for social security taxes.
22

Then still later, in 1978, when Section 119 was
23

amended by Congress to make the exclusion apply to meals fur­
24

nished for the convenience of the employer, although the
25

employer imposes a partial charge, Senator Long, Chairman of

2

the Finance Committee and manager of the bill on the floor of

3

the Senate, stated on the Senate floor that it was expected

that "an item excluded from gross income under the convenience

7

come tax withholding, social security or FICA, and FUTA tax."

I

In Central Illinois, this Court found that even thougl

8
9
10

11
12
13
14

lunch payments received by employees were subject to Income tax
in their hands, they simply were not wages subject to income
tax withholding.

The Government had contended there, as it

contends here, that since the payments at issue were part of
the employment relationship and a part of the total of the per­
sonal benefits that arose out of that relationship, they neces­
sarily constituted wages.

This Court, however, rejected what

15

it described as "such an expansive and sweeping definition of
16

wages," finding such contention to be inconsistent with the
17

congressional purpose of setting forth a standard that is wages,
18

which the

Court described as being intentionally narrow and

19

precise.
20

The Court emphasized that the base is limited to
21

wages and that such term is limited by statute

in the case of

22

income tax withholding to mean "all remuneration for services
23

performed by an employee for his employer," essentially, the
24

identical words of the FICA and FUTA tax statutes.
25
North American Heportinq
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

11

The Court

1

also emphasized that the term "wages" makes the tax base much

2

narrower than subjectability to income taxation.

3

Now, it’s true the Government has cited some authority

4

for contrary conclusion.

5

American Fisheries in 1943, long before Central Illinois was

6

decided by this

7

-- that the convenience of the employer test might be inappli­

8

cable for social security tax purposes, and such suggestion was

9

later cited by approval by a district court in the Kresge cases

10

11
12
13
14
15

case,

Although the 9th Circuit in Pacific

suggested -- and it's only a suggestion

and by another district court in the Goldsboro case.

Such
i

statements are all dicta in those cases because in every single
one of those cases, Pacific American Fisheries, Kresge, and
Goldsboro, it was found that the meals or lodging involved were
not furnished as a convenience to the employer, as has been
conceded here.
Now, the Government has not been wholly consistent in

16

its position on this question.

Immediately after the social

17

security tax was enacted in 1935, the Service in 1936

issued

18

Regulation 90,

specifically adopting the convenience of the

19

employer test for FUTA tax purposes.

And in 1937 the Service

20

repeated that position in Social Security Tax Ruling 110 and
21

interestingly enough, citing there as authority for its positior
22

that meals and lodging for the convenience of the employer were
23

not subject to social security tax, its previous income tax
24

ruling in 1920 to the same effect.
25
North American Reportinq
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

12

1

Now the Government makes essentially four arguments.

2

It points out that it revised its regulations in 1940 to exclude

3

mention of the convenience of employer test.

4

that such regulations were issued pursuant to specific grant of

5

statutory authority to the Social Security Board and the

6

Treasury, and notes that such regulations, it says, have been ir

7

effect for 40 years and that the underlying purpose of social

8

security justifies a different result for income tax and social

9

security tax purposes.
But we submit that the Government is simply wrong.

10

11
12
13
14
15
16
17

And it claims

There is no specific statutory authority.

The only authority

to issue a regulation cited by the Government is in Internal
Revenue Code Section 7805(a) authorizing the issuance of inter­
pretive and procedural regulations for the entire Internal
Revenue Code.

And as Professor Davis has pointed out in his

treatise on administrative law at Section 503, nearly all Trea­
sury regulations are interpretative and not legislative regula­
tions.

I beg your pardon?

Justice Blackmun?

18

QUESTION:

No; no.

19

MR. WORTHY:

This Court in 1945, in overturning an

20

administrative determination as to whether certain payments
21

were wages for social security purposes, under the very identi­
22

cal language and under the very identical act

2

Congress did neither."

Congress used a well-understood word, the Court said,

3

wages, to indicate the receipts which were to govern taxes and

4

benefits under the Social Security Act.

5

case, the Government told the 4th Circuit on brief in 1972 that

6

"We agree with the district court's conclusion that the term

7

'wages' has the same meaning for all of the employment taxes

8

involved."

Now, in the Royster

in the Royster case and the 7th Circuit in the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

20

Court:
21

Like many other tax cases that have come before the
22

Court in recent terms, this case is governed by longstanding
23

Treasury regulations that explicitly support the Internal
24

Revenue Service's position.

The regulations in question are set

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

14

1

forth in our brief at the Appendix, page 7a.

2

fining wages for both FICA and FUTA purposes -- the regulations

3

on this score are identical -- "Ordinarily, facilities or privi­

4

leges (such as entertainment, medical services, or so-called

5

'courtesy' discounts...), furnished or offered by an employer

6

to his employees generally are not considered as remuneration

7

for employment if such facilities or privileges are of relative­

8

ly small value and are offered or furnished by the employer

9

merely as a means of promoting the health, good will, content­

10

ment, or efficiency of his employees."
)

But then, in language that we consider crucial, the

11
12
13
14
15
16
17

They say, in de­

regulation goes on to say, "The term 'facilities or privileges',
however, does not ordinarily include the value of meals or
lodging furnished, for example, to restaurant or hotel employees
or to seamen or other employees

aboard vessels, since generally

these items constitute an appreciable part of the total remune­
ration of such employees."
We consider that the language of this regulation,

18

which has been extant since 1940, some 41 years, control this
19

case.
20

QUESTION:

That's a FUTA regulation?

21

MR. SMITH:

That is a FICA and a FUTA regulation.

2

regulations are, of course, consistent with the statutory defi­

3

nition of wages as all remuneration for employment, including

5

than cash.
QUESTION:

MR. SMITH:

8

10

11

Now, were these regulations adopted in

These regulations -- to trace the history

in some detail, the regulations first came out in 1936, right
after social security was enacted.

From 1936 to 1940, the

FUTA regulations for some peculiar

reason incorporated the

convenience of the employer doctrine that petitioner relies
12

upon in this case.

In 1940,

the

FICA

regulations, and

13

indeed the analog of the social security regulations, never in­
14

cluded the convenience of the employer doctrine.
15

QUESTION:

So the contemporaneous construction of one

16

of the sets of regulations, at any rate, is not in accordance
17

with the Government’s present position?
18

MR. SMITH:

Well, the contemporaneous construction,

19

that was short-lived in the sense that it was only for four
20

years.

And the initial regulation was at variance on FUTA.

21

The point that we stress is that in 1940 that was corrected and
22

since 1940, for the last 41 years, the regulations have con­
23

sistently required that meals and lodging be included in the
24

tax base.

Those regulations, we submit, are consistent with

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

16

1

the committee reports which accompanied the enactment of the

2

social security legislation, indicating that wages were to in­

3

clude compensation paid in any form, such as room and board.

4

And viewed against the background of the way -- when social

5

security was enacted in the mid-1930s, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I

6

would suggest that many people worked for little more than room

7

and board, and Congress was terribly concerned that those people

8

be covered and that they get benefits consistent with those

9

wages.

That's why we're here.

You'd still be here

if you didn't pick it up until '62, wouldn't you?

7

10

He disagrees with me, but we would submit

That's true.

His only point --

You'd best have changed your mind before.
Exactly.

May I simply suggest, on that

four-year period from 1936 to 1940, I would suggest that the
Court has dealt with a similar problem a few terms ago in the
National Muffler Dealers Association case.

Indeed, where the

12

regulations were amended after about eight or nine years from
13

the -- I think from 1919 to 1927, the regulations were at var­
14

iance with the way they were finally recast.

But our point

15

simply is that the regulations now that have been extant for
16

41 years have been extant during a period in which Congress
17

recodified the tax law in 1954 and there were a number of
18

appellate decisions that upheld the inclusion of meals and
19

lodgings.

And to point simply that the result would be other­

20

wise with respect to income tax purposes, for income tax pur­
21

poses, or income tax withholding purposes, is really beside the
22

point.

I mean, nobody's quarreling here that these meals and

23

lodging were excludable under 119 and I think, as Mr. Justice
24

Brennan pointed out, the reason they're excluded from income

25

1

tax withholding is simply they're not subject to income tax,

2

so why should they be subject to income tax withholding?

3

court of appeals here, below, said the same thing.

4

is not difficult to surmise, because income tax withholding is

5

to set aside amounts to pay the recipient's income taxes.

6

There isn't any income tax due on this by operation of statute,

7

Section 119, which the Court dealt with a few terms ago in the

8

Kowalski case.

A rationale

Now --

QUESTION:

How many courts of appeals have supported

your position other than the 5th Circuit?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Three.
And how many opposed it?

MR. SMITH:

Let's see, the 9th Circuit and the 6th

Circuit and the 4th Circuit support our position in addition
to the 5th Circuit.

The Court of Claims has rejected our posi­

15

tion, and the 7th Circuit in the Oscar Mayer case has rejected
16

our position.

And this leads me to what I think is really the

17

nub of the problem here.

The nub of the problem here is that

18

the Court of Claims in Hotel Conquistador and the 7th Circuit
19

in Oscar Mayer believe that the climate somehow changed in this
20

area after this Court decided the Central Illinois Public Ser­
21

vice Company case.

And we submit that the court of appeals

22

below here correctly found that that question in that case does
23

not bear on this case.
24

As the Court will recall, the issue before the court
25

1

there was reimbursements for noon meals.

2

those reimbursements were subject to income tax withholding.

3

The Court's opinion in that case stressed heavily the fact that

4

the employer in that case in 1963 could not reasonably have beer

5

held to be aware of the fact that it was required to withhold or

6

such meal reimbursements.

7

notice or lack of notice, the Court was unwilling to impose

8

10
11

And we argued that

And because of that so-called unfair

secondary tax liability on the employer in that case.
If I may just read a few excerpts from the Court's
opinion, where the Court says at page 32, "In 1963 not one
regulation or ruling required withholding on any travel expense
reimbursement.

The intimation was quite the other way.

No

12
13

employer in viewing the regulations in 1963 could reasonably
suspect that a withholding obligation existed.

The first

14

published pronouncement by the Internal Revenue Service with
15

respect to withholding came only in 1969," many years after -16

well, six years after the tax year in that case.
17

Those considerations don't bear here.

There can be

18

no question that since 1940 employers were on notice, employers
19

like Rowan Company, that they were required to include meals
20

and lodging in FICA and FUTA, whatever the income tax or the
21

income tax withholding situation might have been.

Indeed, the

22

Service in the 1940s was publishing rulings which we cite in
23

our brief that the result would be different under income tax
24

withholding.

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, let me ask you about a sentence

2

on page 28 of the Central Illinois Public Service Company case,

3

the beginning, after IV, where the Court says, "The Government

4

straightforwardly and simplistically argues that the definition

5

of 'wages' in Section 3401(a) corresponds to the first category

6

of gross income set forth in Section 61(a)(1), and that the

7

two statutes, although not entirely congruent in their rela­

8

tionship, have equivalent scope."

tion?
MR. SMITH:

10
11
12

No.

We don't take that position be­

cause we all benefit from the Court's statement in that respect.
Here Congress -QUESTION:

13
14

No.

Do you still take that posi­

Well, you're just backing off one step at

a time.
MR. SMITH:

No, no.

I think our position is strongly

15

buttressed by these regulations which have survived reenactment
16

and, as the Court has said on a number of instances, that
17

Treasury regulations in that kind of context, which survive
18

reenactments of the statute, which are extant during approba19

tive appellate decisions which can reasonably be believed to
20

have come to the attention of Congress, that those kinds of
21

regulations have the effect of law.

The Court has said that in

22

the Cammarano case and in the Correll case.

And we think that

23

the differences, the

qualitative differences between the kind

24

of case that we brought to the Court in Central Illinois and
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

21

1

this case are very marked.

2

this Court that the Correll rule had to be imported into the

3

withholding tax regulations, and the Court rejected that, be­

4

cause the Correll rule came many years after the regulations,

5

and in fact the regulations that the Court cited in the Central

6

Illinois case could reasonably have been read to support the

7

taxpayer’s position in that case.

In Central Illinois, I argued to

Here there can be no question that the regulations
fit this case like a glove.

These are meals and lodging afford­

ed to seamen and people who work on vessels, they constitute
an appreciable part of their remuneration -QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, following up on Justice

Rehnquist's question, there you said that the two concepts were
the same and we said, no, the concept of income is the larger
concept and wages are smaller.

Here you're saying wages is a

15

larger concept than income.
16

MR. SMITH:

No, I'm saying that wages for purposes of

17

FICA and FUTA, under the social security statute -18

QUESTION:

It's a larger concept than income for

19

income tax purposes.
20

MR. SMITH:

-- is a different kind of concept.

21

QUESTION:

But then larger.

22

MR. SMITH:

Because Congress wanted it to be larger,

23

and we think that, unlike our case in Central Illinois, Congress
24

explicitly indicated that it wanted it to be larger.
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

22

1

The Treasury has specifically indicated that it wanted it to be

2

larger by regulations that explicitly govern the case, and it

3

wasn't --

4
5

QUESTION:

If Congress had said explicitly, wages

shall include matters that are not income?
MR. SMITH:

6

Well, yes, in a sense.

For example, the

7

regulations under withholding point to the fact that, you know,

8

they have a cross-reference to Section 119.

9

lodging

that

It says meals and

. excludable for income tax purposes

are

10

excludable for wages for purposes of the income tax withholding.

11

See Section 1.119-1.

12
13
14
15
16
17

And the point simply is, there's no point

in withholding income taxes from amounts that are not subject
to income tax.

This is -- the social security system, we submit,

is a completely different system.

It's a completely different

statutory system designed to afford benefits.

The Court has

said that on a number of occasions in social security tax
cases.
QUESTION:

And yet there's no vested right in the

18

benefit.
19

MR. SMITH:

No, there's no vested right in the benefit

20

but we think that given the Court's careful construction of its
21

opinion in Central Illinois indicating that the Government's
22

view was not to prevail because of the lack of notice to the
23

affected industry, simply doesn't apply here

where the notice

24

could not have been more explicitly stated.

There can be no

meals and lodging to their employees have long been on notice

12
13
14
15

of the rule in this case.
QUESTION:

If they're outside of the scope of the

congressional authorization to the Commissioner, they would be.
MR. SMITH:

Indeed, that's so.

But given the commit­

tee reports' plainly stated intention to include room and board
16

in taxable wages in 1935, I don't see how they could be outside
17

the congressional -- Congress Indicated that it wanted to in­
18

clude this kind of compensation in taxable wages for social
19

security, notwithstanding the fact that at that time the con­
20

venience of the employer test for income tax purposes had been
21

around for quite some time.

It just doesn't apply here, and

22

the Service has indicated that it doesn't apply, it has indi­
23

cated for the last 45 years that it doesn't apply here.

That's

24

why Central Illinois, we suggest, has no bearing on this case,
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

24

1

and indeed, one of the other aspects of Central Illinois was

2

the fact that the Court intimated that it was -- that they

3

thought that perhaps the cash payments in Kowalski -- that the

4

cash payments, or the income tax aspects of the cash payments,

5

weren't really clear until this Court's opinion in Kowalski.

6

Assuming that that was the case, that consideration has no

7

application here where everyone has long been aware of the fact

8

that meals and lodging furnished to seamen aboard vessels --

9

nothing could be more applicable, I submit.

10

11
12
13
14

And given the

Court's many quoted statements about the deference to be given
Treasury regulations, here the Treasury has issued a regulation
that carefully and explicitly is addressed to this very case.
QUESTION:

You seem to be overlooking one marked dif­

ference between the seamen and these fellows.

The seamen can't

be transported to shore for breakfast, lunch and dinner, or
15

even for lunch.
16

MR. SMITH:

I would suggest that the fact that they

17

could be but weren't really is not a qualitative difference
18

in terms of seamen.
19

QUESTION:

When they're out at sea they can't be sent

20

somewhere like MacDonald's or other food shops.
21

MR. SMITH:

That is true but, Mr. Chief Justice, here

No, we have to be concerned with the case

in Oscar Mayer, it had been settled among the lower courts that
the rule was in our favor.

What is germane are these long-standing Treasury

regulations which we believe, having survived reenactment,

been issued against the background of a long-standing and con­
sistent body of revenue rulings that have put the affected
industry on notice, unlike the public utility in Central

15

Illinois, that the rule is that they are to be included in the

taxable wage base.

For that reason, we believe the court of

The Government repeatedly refers to this longstanding

2

Treasury regulation issued in 1940.

3

that as late as 1957 in Revenue Ruling 57-471, in interpreting

this very regulation, the Internal Revenue Service said that

5

Social Security Tax Ruling 302 which had invoked the convenience

7
8

10

of the employer test and said that meals and lodging for the
convenience were excludable, were still in full force and effect.
Thus, the Service itself, despite the notice supposedly given
under the regulation, was still interpreting its own regulation
17 years later as applying the convenience of employer rule.
QUESTION:

12

I would remind the Court

Was this in an individual case of an

individual taxpayer?
MR. WORTHY:

No, sir.

This case -- let me explain.

13

In 57-171, the Service issued a sort of a bifurcated opinion.
14

It ruled in that case that meals and lodging for the convenience
15

of restaurant employees were subject to social security tax
16

but for reasons that fully escape me meals and lodging furnished
17

for the convenience of other employees, including bank and

trust company employees, were not subject to social security

tax.
