ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. ROTH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The Crow Indian Reservation created by the: treaty of

10

1868 is an area of approximately 2.2 mil]ion acres located in

1 1

the: State of Montana.

12

tribal hands and is located in the Pryor Mountains of the

Big Horn Mountains, and there are no issues involved in this

It is a navigable stream and

within the heart of the Reservation flows for approximately
45 to 50 miles.
In the Big Horn Mountains area., the Yellowtail Dam,
a federally funded project, has been built, which backs up a
reservoir of approximately 70 miles, which extends into the
State of Wyoming.

The building of that dam created an

excellent cold water fishery.

QUESTION:

Is the dam inside the Reservation?

3

HR. ROTH:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

However --

The cold water

That is, the river itself does not lend itself to spawning.

the State of Montana has consistently required a state hunting

or fishing license.

MR. ROTH:

Nonmenbers of the Crow Indian Tribe.

No.

There isn't any permission required

by the; State of Montana to go on the pond.

It's open to the

public.
QUESTiON:

And that's been true up until this liti­

gation, anyway?
MR. ROTH:

Yes.

That's correct.

In this lawsuit

brought by the United States and joined in by the Crow Tribe
of Indians, the United States claims that the Big Horn River,
this navigable river, is owned by them in fee for the benefi­

23

cial ownership of the Crow India.n Tribe.

They also claim in

Additionally, I would like to comment upon the

same factual findings the lower court reached a conflicting
conclusion.
Bsisically, there are two sets of issues in this
case, which we will sepairate into what we call the ownership
or river issues, and the regulatory issues.

However, both

sets of issues require that a study of the treaty history and
7

1

the legislative history entered into between the United States

2

and the Tribe be undertaken.

3

The first treaty with the Crow and the United States

4

occurred in 1825.

5

It established the paramount authority of the United States,

6

and that authority was extended to resolve disputes that might

7

occur between the Indians and the non-Indians.

The only reference to hunting

This was followed by the Treaty of 1868.
Again, in Article I of that treaty, the: United States

was a sovereignty; paramount sovereignty was again recognized,
and it was the only sovereign in that treaty who could sanctior
non-Indian intruders or malfeasors, if you will. There was
no jurisdiction or sovereignty which was given or granted tc
the tribes by that treaty.
QUESTION:

And I think that's very, very --

Of course, the very existence of a treaty

implied the sovereignty of the Indian nation, didn't it?

You

don't msLke a treaty with somebody who's not a sovereign.
MR. ROTH:

Well, that's correct.
8

The United States,

1

however, was -- many times, of course, treaties are entered

2

into with equa] sovereignty, such as to

QUESTION:

Between us and England, say?

4

HR. ROTH:

Between us and England.

In this case the

5

paramount sovereignty of the United States was conceded by

6

the tribe.
QUESTION:

7

8

But you don't make a treaty with somebody

who doesn't have some sovereign qualities?

MR. ROTH:

Yes.

Well, as a matter of

13

fact, though, although the quasi-sovereignty of the Indian

14

tribes was recognized at that time, there was no question that

15

the United States could pass a law if they wanted to, and do

16

whatever they wished with regard to the Indians.

17

out of deference to their particular status, I'm sure that they

18

did treat with them.

Superimposed upon those treaties is a legislative

going to touch at some point in your oral argument on the
Equal Footing doctrine of Pollard v. Hagan?
MR. ROTH:

23
24

Before you get to that, Mr. Roth, are you

Yes, sir.

The allotment policy was

applied to the Crow Indian Reservation by the Allotment Act
of 1920.

Against this treaty and legislative backdrop is the

Equal Footing Doctrine upon which the State of Montana, makes

of 1868 in the case of Martin v. Waddell, which was decided

in 1842.

It's important to note that that doctrine was

I think it's also important to fasten upon why the

9

10

Equa] Footing Doctrine apparently came into existence.

11

Martin v. Waddell, in studying the underpinnings of that par­

12

ticular doctrine, this Court apparently seized upon the fact

13

that by the Revolutionary War the 13 original colonies gained

of England.

colonies.

And in that first case, really articulating the

Equal Footing Doctrine,

I think it's important to note that

they said that title, by virtue of the Constitution, was not
vested in the United States, it was vested in the tribe, and
by virtue of the Constitution, then, in territorial days the

11

1

fee title to those navigable waters was held by the United

States in trust for the future states that would be carved out

Section 2 of the Organic Act,

or Section 1 of the Organic Act establishing the Territory of
Montana -QUESTION:

And where’is this, Mr. Roth?

MR. ROTH:

It appears at pages 30-31 in Vol.

II of

the Joint Appendix.
And it states, "That nothing in this act contained
shall be construed to impair the rights of persons or property
now pertaining to the Indians

in said territory so long as

such rights remain unextinguished by treaty between the United
23

States and such Indians, or to include any territory" -- now,
24

here is the important part:

"...which, by treaty with any

25

12

1

Indian tribes, is not, without the consent of said tribe, to

2

be included within the territorial limits or jurisdiction of

3

any state or territory."
Now, what's significant about that? That is signifi­

4

5

cant because in the; Treaty of 186 8 the drafters of that

6

treaty did not provide, as they did in the treaties of New

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Roth?

MR. ROTH:

Yes, Justice Blachmun.

QUESTION:

In these treaties, however, with the

Indians, do you think that the Crow understood the meaning of
the Equal Footing Doctrine?
MR. ROTH:

No, I don't think they did, Youi1 Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, isn't the understanding of the

respective parties to the treaties rather important, then?
MR. ROTH:

Well, I believe so.

I also don't believe

22

that they understood what the ownership of the bed arid banks
23

of the navigable river actually entailed, nor did they possess
24

the sovereignty that I think is necessary for the regulation,
25

13

1

control, and ownership of a segment of a large, navigable

2

stream, was within their understanding.

3
4

QUESTION:

What is the value of a treaty or any

engagement if we're going to probe into the understanding?

5

MR. ROTE:

I teg your pardon?

6

QUESTION:

What is the value of a. treaty or a con­

7

tract if we're going to undertake to probe into whether the

8

parties understood the contents?
MR. ROTH:

9

Well, at times this Court appears to have

10

indicated that it is relevant as to what the understanding of

1 1

the parties was in the circumstances.

12

QUESTION:

Special Rule as to Indian Treaties?

13

MR. ROTH:

Yes, that's correct.

And particularly

14

the circumstances surrounding those treaties.

15

cuts

16

believe, in Rosebud v. Kneip, the surrounding circumstances,

17

i.e., the legislation, the case law7 that existed at that par­

18

ticular time, was also important in ascertaining what the

19

intent of the United States was with regard to the particular

I cite to you Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. Alaska, and
France, United

States v. Moore, and United States v. Stotts.
In Skokomish, of course, because of the absence of

1 1

12

an interest or dependence upon fish, the lower court held

13

that it would not imply that navigable waters were contained

14

within the confines of the reservation.

15

that the lower court, in its factual findings, found that the

16

Crow Tribe was not dependent upon the Big Horn River for tra­

Also, that -- it's important, I think, that most of, if

not all of the tribal interests in the river are preserved
without actual proprietorship being conveyed.
For example, the Winters Doctrine reserves to them

Also, it's important

water.

The U.S. v. Powers reserves to them irrigation rights.

Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes v. Namen guarantees them
access and use of the water.

And of course, the fact thait

they are riparian to the. river guarantees thait they w7ill have
access to the fishing or whaitever waterfowl or upland game

birds are found along its shores or on its waters.
QUESTION:

That's a matter of state lav»7, isn't It?

Any riparian owner has those rights?

4

MR. ROTH

That's correct; that's correct.

5

QUESTION

Mr. Roth?

6

MR. ROTH

Yes, Mr. Justice White?

7

QUESTION

Do you think the claim here that's been

8

sustained in favor of the Tribe indicates that they own not

9

only the bed of the river but the water in the stream, in the

10

sense that they could control, if they wanted to, the navi­

11

gability of the stream?

12

13
14

MR. ROTH:

I won't concede that point.

I will

concede that they will claim it.
QUESTION:

Do you think the judgment below would

15

enable the tribe not only to regulate fishing in the river but

16

the navigation of it ?

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

MR. ROTH:

I would concede that they will assert

that right, Your Honor.
QUESTION
MR.. ROTH

Well, how do you read the holding below?
I read the holding below as conveying to

them ownership of the enti.re stream.
QUESTION

Of the entire stream?

MR., ROTH

Yes, presumably regulatory power-.

QUESTION

Because, after all, there is no necessary

connection between ownership of the bed of the stream and
16

1

control of navigation..

2
3

HR. ROTH:

Absolutely not.

They've conceded the

navigational servitude.
QUESTION:

4

Furthermore, there's no necessary connec­

5

tion between ownership of the bed of the stream and the ability

6

to fish in the water.
MR. ROTH:

7

Well, other than the statement in

8

Shively v. Bowlby that the navigational servitude includes .the

9

right to travel, the right of commerce, and also the right of

10

public fishing.
QUESTION:

1 1

Well, but, as you well know, in the

12

western states there is certainly a major controversy between

13

those who claim they own the bed of the river and people who

14

want to float the river.

15

16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

MR. ROTH:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And I suppose that the holding below woulc.

indicate the Tribe could keep people from .floating the river
fishing?
MR. ROTH:

Yes.

Actually, with regard to that

argument -QUESTION:

As long as they didn't get on the banks

or the bottom of the stream?
MR. ROTH:

Yes.

Basically, they've conceded that

the; river ownership isn't exclusive.
QUESTION:

There's a rule in some states, you know.

25

17

1

MR. ROTH:

They can float the river but they can't

2

cast their line into the water and catch a fish planted by the

3

State of Montana, is basically a part of that issue.

4

5

QUESTION:

Well, the holding below would say the

Tribe could prevent floaters on the; river?

6

MR.

7

QUESTION:

Why?

MR.

Because ---

Now, you might grant, logically, the right to float on the

that you were saying just that, that they could not separate

these two?

20

21
22

24

25

MR. ROTH:

Well, I think they would not separate

the two because, in the first instance, there isn't any treaty
language thait would even approach that kind of an intent.
And tc do that, I believe, basically would be inconsistent
because there was certainly nothing in 1868 which would make
the bottom or bed of the stream particularly valuable to the
20

1

Tribe nor that they placed any particular value upon the bed
2

of the stream.

of the questions in the case is fishing in the river.

Thus, to separate --

MR. ROTE:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

It isn't taking things off the bottom of

the river and if they don't have control over navigation in
the river and the use of the water in the river, what is the
authority to prevent, fishing in the river?

10

MR. ROTH:

Your Honor, that is our argument.

Where

11

is the authority?

12

tories the respondents have conceded that Confederated Salish

13

and Kootenai Tribes v. Namen, which I referred to as Namen I

14

because Namen II is on its course up through the appellate

15

court, an early decision by the Honorab]e William J. Jameson,

16

which held that on the Flathead Lake in Montana, within the

17

Flathead Indian Reservation, riparian owners did have, pur­

18

suant to the navigational servitude, the right of access and

19

wharfage without tribal permission to the navigable waters of

I reiterate that in answers to interroga­

In response to interrogatories in this case, the

21

22

respondents have conceded that that case is authoritative in

23

this case and that, indeed, all riparian owners have those

24

rights, which the Honorable William J. Jameson articulated in

25

Namen I.

upon that particular dilemma.

MR. ROTH:

Apparently.

I would also like to rapidly

focus upon certain other factors which I believe bear upon the

The argument apparently

Mr. Roth, before you leave the ownership

issue permanently, is it your view that immediately before

1 1

Montana became a state the title to the river was in the

MR.

QUESTION:

15

That's what it was?

16

MR.

ROTE:

ROTH:

As trustee for the State.
As trustee for the State to be formed?
All right.
Yes.

And perhaps, in further answer to

17

that question, there was in effect that obligation on the

18

United States to hold that fee title for the State was consti­

Mr. Roth, could, you tell me just a little

of the Yellowstone and the Big Horn River, almost three billion
acre feet per year to the Yellowstone River.

thought, because I want to be sure I have your position.

1 1

your view that this trustee relationship between the United

origin aand it was formed before 1868.

the Treaty of 1868 had. in explicit language said, we hereby

MR. ROTH:

Does that mean that if

I don't think one can ignore this Court's

language in Shively v. Bowlby and in Choctaw Nation v.

QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't that have raised some con­

stitutional implications under the Equs.l Footing Doctrine,

4

which is a part of the Constitution --

5

MR. ROTH:

Yes, there is a constitutional question

6

raised there, and I think one would then perhaps, going to

7

Shively v. Bowlby, and assuming that Shively v. Bowlby did

8

indeed put strict parameters around departure of the policy --

9

i . e. , a public exigency or international duty called for1 a dec­

10

laration of intent -- then I suppose one could inquire into

1 1

whether or not Congress in approving the treaty or the legis­

12

lation was acting within those constitutional parameters es­

13

tablished in Shively v. Bowlby.

14

15

16

17

QUESTION:

Well, there's some tension here, isn't

there, between the Equal Footing Doctrine and the Choctaw easel
MR. ROTH:

I believe there is.

I believe there is,

Your Honor.

18

I would like to touch briefly upon the regulatory

19

issue and would say this, that if this Court's decision re­

20

cently in Colt with regard to the taxing authority of the

21

Tribes is indeed a test, which I perceive that it is, and that

22
23
24

25

that test basically has three prongs.
Number one, that Indian authority or sovereignty over1
a nonmember steps at tribal land.

Secondly, that a legitimate

tribal- interest must be perceived in the regulation.
27

1

And thirdly, that there is no overriding federal policy which

2

conflicts wi1h the regulation.

3

present test of nonmember exercise of sovereignty, or tribal

4

exercise of sovereignty over nonmembers, then Resolution

5

74--0 5 doesn't satisfy any of that three-prong test.

6

If I perceive that as the

Number one, obviously they exert their sovereignty

7

over the nonmember on fee lands, not Indian lands.

Secondly,

8

I don't perceive any legitimate Indian interest here, because

9

we're talking about, not the mountain area, the 400,000 acres

10

set aside for the tribal wildlife commissary, we're talking

1 1

about the lowlands that theoretically all of which could ulti­

12

mately end up in non-Indian lands;

In addition, if this Court approves Resolution

5

74-05, it seems to me that some rather serious constitutional

6

questions are raised, and I would just briefly touch upon

7

those.

8
9

This is not a case -- unlike some of the; others -where a tribe; is trying to preserve to themselves a part of

10

the wi.ldlife resource. They are attempting to confiscate what

1 1

is normally an inherent constituent value of fee title to land,

12

and that is the non-Indian's right to hunt and fish on his fee

13

lands or to permit anyone he wants to to come, on there and

14

hunt and fish on that land.

15

Moreover, that particular regulation or resolution

16

has been actively supported by the United States in a number

17

of ways ever since i.t's been enacted.

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

25

And of course the

Wilmington Parking Lot v. Burton case comes immediately to
mind, wherein the forces of the state or the power of the
state was placed behind discriminatory conduct, this .Court
said that was state action.
The action on the part of the United States in this
case, under the Fifth Amendment, is much more overt and much
more, active, including, of course, this lawsuit itself..
And additionally, I would like to focus upon
29

1

Holt Civic Club v. Tuscaloosa, which again raises a very, very

2

serious question as to extraterritorial jurisdiction of a city.

3

There, in a split decision, this Court apparently approved

4

the extraterritorial powers of the city because they affected

5

nonresidents of the city, ergo there was no confiscation of

6

the voting right;

7

passed only miror things, but did not encompass taxation,

8

zoning, or eminent domain.

9

appear to be desires of the Crow Tribe to have vindicated by

10

rebuttal.

All of these latter, of course,

Thank you very much.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

-- was the issue here?

The answer

14

is tw'ofold:

have at all stages of this case conceded that if the Tribe,

there was a somewhat change of emphasis under perhaps prompt­

4

QUESTION:

Wei], Mr. Claiborne, the easy answer --

5

not the easy, but one answer to Justice Stewart's question is

that if you -- if someone owns the riverbed but someone else

12

Now, I may say that ait the beginning, there may have

been a question whether the navigatiomil servitude of the

Isn't that generally what follows from the

navigational servitude, a

public right of aiccess to navigable

streams to traverse a stream?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

But it may be, Mr. Justice Stewart,

that in the case of an entire territory which is sealed off,
as this was intended to be, with an explicit, promise by the
United States to let no one enter except by permission of the

23

Tribe, that the public right to come on this relatively small

MR. CLAIBORNE:

bed to the Tribe, may nevertheless have reserved the: fishery

because you

We approach it much as the 9th

You don't thi.rik that the 9th Circuit would indicate at all

CLAIBORNE:

Indeed, the 9th Circuit explicitly

said the opposite, and so had the -- in the Namen case: in­

17

the Tribe's claim to the bed of the: Flathead Lake:, just as it

did here, and while it conceded the riparian right of the fee

owners to wharfage and to access for navigation to the lake,

of 1868 that it has the exclusive property right to hunt and fish

MR. LYNAUGH:

I think the negotiations of the treaty

pointed out that the fishing, Your Honor, and the hunting, the
sustenance that can be derived from the sources within the
reservation

was

veryimportant to the Tribe.

QUESTION:

That doesn't address my question, does it?

MR. LYNAUGH:

I think it does from the standpoint

21

that the total grant made to the Tribe

included the river for

that purpose.

argument even if the State owned the bottom.

It's the bottdm of the riverbed that

flows below the dam and the afterbed.
It is our feeling that we do have an exclusive
property right to hunt and fish within the boundaries of the
Reservation, excepting the one exception that was made by the
52

1

9th Circuil

2

that in balancing the allotment acts

3

intent of the treaty, that the rights of the Tribe, to exclu­

4

sive use of its Reservation have been abolished to the point

5

where they cannot exclude non-Indian sport fishermen from

6

coming within the Reservation and using the resource.

7

as to fee-resident owners.

But we do not believe
. with the original

There is no express indication in the record that

8

that right to exclude others, non-Indian sportsmen, from the

9

Reservation hunting and fishing has been done.

I think, once

10

again, this is an ongoing governmental body, this is a tribal

1 1

body that's operating and actively practising its culture.

12

Seventy percent cf the land is currently in trust.

13

Section 14 of the Allotment Act, which appears at the Peti­

14

tioners' Appendix at 10 5,

15

vision where land can actually pass back from fee status into

16

trust status, and the Tribe is actively involved in trying to

17

repurchase some of the land that has gone out of the trust

18

status, to maintain its culture and to maintain its majority

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Under

and.the page at 116 , there is a pro­

impact within the boundaries of its Reservation.
If this Court were not to grant the exclusive right
to control hunting and fishing within the boundaries of the
Reservation, then I think the Reservation would become
diminished without express congressional enactments.

And

also, it v'ould greatly reduce and almost make meaningless the
attempt by the Tribe to regulate, a regulation that I think
53

1

has been recognized by Petitioners, to control hunting and

2

fishing on trust lands, to control non-Indian access to trust

3

lands for hunting and fishing, because of the nature of the

4

combination of fee land and trust land.

5

I would like to point out and read a paragraph, be­

6

cause I believe it is important.

at page 86 of that volume.

QUESTION:

In Volume II of the Joint

86, did you say?

MR. LYNAUGH:

Yes, Your Honor, 86.

And it's a letter'

1 1

from the Superintendent of the Crow Agency to the Area Direc­

12

tor, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in Billings.

13

letter that actually attached to the resolution that's in ques­

14

tion here, Resolution 7405.

15

And it's a

It's stated there, on page 87:

"Hunting pressure on the reservation has increased

16

to a point where game is depleted or nonexistent in

17

vast areas.

18

prosperity and inflated food prices contribute greatly

24

25

New highways, increases in population,

to the influx of sportsmen, meat hunters and poachers."
At the bottom of the page, and I think the critical
paragraph 4(a):
"The general public has taken advantage of interspersed fee and Indian trust lands to utilize the whole
reservation without respect to land status because the
State of Montana takes no responsibility for the
54

1

policing of Indian lands, the Crow Tribe does not have

2

the funds, the police force, nor the authority to protect

3

their lands and the Department of the Interior has not

4

taken effective action to curtain violations.

5

ment is so impractical that with this knowledge the

6

general public utilizes the whole reservation as a haven

7

for unlimited hunting and fishing."

QUESTION:

Mr. Lynaugh,

you

rely

rather

Enforce­

heavily

in your brief on Alaska Pacific Fishery v. United States;

10

what do you make of the language in that case where the Court-

1 1

says about Reservation v. Alaska, "The reservation was not in

12

the nature of a private grant but simply a 'setting apart

13

until otherwise provided by law' of designated public property

14

for a recognized public purpose.'"

15

Would you not say that the admission of a. state to

16

the Union came within the definition of "as otherwise provided

17

by law" in that language?

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

MR.

LYNAUGH:

Notwithstanding that sentence. Your

Honor, my reading of the Alaska Fishermen's case is that the
Government intended clearly to convey title to the waters
ai’ound the island of that Tribe to the Tribe.
QUESTION:

Then that

--

the language, "as otheij1

wise pi'ovided by law" would not include an Act of Congress
admitting a state to the Union?
MR.

LYNAUGH:

I think the grant was made prior

MR. LYNAUGH:

It was; there's no question.

And I think that the Government in­

tended to make the grant.

5

QUESTION:

But --

And I believe Alaska had yet to

Even though the grant were ma.de earlier,

6

the language from the Alaska Fisheries opinions read to you

7

by my brother Rehnquist would indicate, that the grant was a

8

temporary grant or a conditional grant, wouldn't it?

9

to a condition subsequent?

10

MR.

1 1

QUESTION:

12

MR. LYNAUGH:

13
14

15

16
17
18

LYNAUGH:

Subject

I don't --

Wouldn't that language so indicate?
I just believe there's other language

in the decision that clearly shows the intent.
QUESTION:

Well, what about that language rather

than other language of the decision?
MR.

LYNAUGH:

I think it's foreshadowed by the other

language in the decision, Your Honor.
In addition to the paragraphs I've read and the

19

Exhibit that appears at page 88 — 8S, there's also a paragraph

20

that indica+es, at the bottom of page 89, that the Crow Tribe's

21

22
23
24

25

action to close'the Yeservatioft to the pub] ic v?as very unpopu­
lar with the general public and caused retaliations in the
form of some economic sanctions being taken against the Tribe,
not being able to get credit as easily as ^rhey might have been
able to in the past, things of this nature.
56

1

In summary, I think the Tribe believes that some

2

balancing of the treaty rights with current day situations

3

exists, and that the 9th Circuit made a valiant attempt to do

4

this by carving out an exception for the resident fee owners.

5

We think there is a great dea] of rationale involved with

6

that exception, because the resident fee owner is actually

7

contributing to the Reservation economy within the boundaries

8

of the Reservation, in many instances.

9

The Reservation economy is an agricultural economy.

10

The non-Indian is usually leasing lands from Indians and thus

1 1

contributing to the support of Indians within the Reservation.

12

Also, the pressure that the non-Indian would put cn

13

the hunting and fishing within the; Reservation is slight com­

14

pared to the pressure that would be placed on the Reservation

15

by virtue of the opening of the; river to non-Indian hunters

16

and fishers from without the State of Montana and

17

deal

from within.
Therefore, we believe, with regard tc the power to

hunt and fish as a property right and the power to exclude
non-Indians who are. not residents, that power has not been
abrogated from the treaty.

MR.

ROTH:

If it please: the Court, I do.

I'd like to comment briefly upon Crow Tribe Exhibit

3

71qq which apparently states:that there is a shortage of fish

4

and game caused by the influx of non-Indian hunters.

5

fortunate part of 1 hat letter is that the Tribe was either

unwilling or unable to support that assertion in the letter

at trial.

Fritzler, page 263 of the transcript, indicated

1 1

that he stopped, I believe, 2 0 to 30 non-Indian fishermen etnd

12

inquired of them what they were doing.

13

is, he cited one incident involving non-Indian having coolers

14

full of fish.

15

in light of this Court's recent decisions in Sea Coast Products

16

v.

17

has done absolutely nothing with regard to preserving this

18

scarce resource by controlling the acquisition of wildlife and

19

fish by tribal members,.

At 269, I believe it

Superimposed upon this and I think significant

Douglas, and Hughes v.

Oklahoma, is the fact that the Tribe

Tribal members are free to hunt at any season.

20

The

21

record is replete with exa.mpl.es of the fa.ct that they exercise

22

that right in all seasons, including in the spiring, when the

23

cow elk is piregnant; including later on, when the fawn is by

24

her side.

25

QUESTION:

How about limits?
58

1

MR. ROTH:

No limits, Your Honor, absolutely none.

2

But I think significant, as far as the issues in this case are

3

concerned, is the fact that to this day they do not have a

4

significant interest in the fishery.

5

already indicated, it's a put-and-take fishery, and Montana

was putting the fish in and its fishermen were merely taking

them out again.

And certainly I think

this Court, as in Washington v. Fishing Vessel Association,
has shown a regard for Indian interests, Indian tribes having
a percentage of the resource; that's true.

But in this partic--

ular case, if it please Your Honor, there is no evidence that that
particular portion of the wildlife resource is not available
to supply them with food.

And I'm sure, if the*, pressure on

the wildlife resource of the Reservation became too heavy,
then the federal courts, as they did in Washington v. Fishing

24

Vessel Association, could at the behest of the Tribe allocate
25

59

some percentage of the resource to the: Tribe and some per­
