ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME I. CHAPMAN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

-Mr'. Chapman,

MR. CHAPMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The Petitioners are here to ask the Court to
reverse a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,

10

which we believe is not only contrary to established prin­

11

ciples but creates a very serious practical impediment on

12

the ability of District Courts to coordinate and control

13

multi-party complex litigations.

14

the decision of the Ninth Circuit cut back on the normal

15

rule of finality of judgments in the context of multiple-

16

party, multiple action litigation

17

opposite of what should have been done. That is, in these

18

classes of cases there is more rather than less need for

19

adherance to res judicata and the rule of finality.

20

It is our submission that

which is exactly the

We would like to take a few moments to describe

21

briefly the background of this case and how it comes to

22

this Court.

23

pal reasons why we believe that the Ninth Circuit decision is

24

contrary to established principles of res judicata and

25

out of step with the salutory trends in improving the

And then to present what we consider the princi­

3

abilities of the District Court to control and coordinate
1

complex cases.
2

The present case. Your Honor, started the same
3

way as have hundreds of class action cases in the federal
4

court.

It's a class action for treble damages and attorneys

5

fees and other relief, following on the heels of a federal
6

government action.

In April of 1976, the federal government

7

obtained a misdemeanor indictment against Petitioners under
8

Section 1 of the Sherman Act, charging that the Petitioners
9

had agreed on the prices of women's clothings in their stores
10

in Northern California.

Shortly thereafter, a multiplicity

1 1

of private class actions were filed; there were seven in all,
12

two of those were filed by the same counsel.

One of the

13

actions, which was entitled Moitie v. Federated and Saks
14

has been voluntarily dismissed by the Plaintiffs, and that
15

action is not before this Court.
16

The other action is the Brown case, which is
17

the only case that is before the Court this morning.

The

18

complaint in the Brown case, as I say, was largely patterned
19

on the government's pleadings.

It alleged that the Peti­

20

tioners had agreed to charge certain prices in their stores
21

on women's clothing and that the Plaintiffs and the class
22

members that were purportedly represented had been injured
23

by being overcharged on those purchases.

The one difference

24

was that unlike the government action and the other six
25

class actions, the Brown case alleged that the violations
took place in Southern California, rather than in Northern
California.

Now, the cases proceeded in the District Court

before a -- they were coordinated before a single judge and
in July of 1976, the Petitioners moved to dismiss all seven
cases for failure

to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).

There was extensive briefing on the motion, in fact, the
District Court set aside one entire day for oral argument.
And in January of 1977, the District Court dismissed all
seven cases.
There were several issues considered, but the
primary ground that was relied upon in the District Court's

13

dismissal was that the Plaintiffs and class members as

14

retail purchasers did not allege an injury to their business

15
16
17

or property which would entitle them to treble damage
recovery under the Clayton Act, Section 4.
The parties in five of the other cases appealed,

18

and we've referred to these for convenience in our brief, as

19

the Weinberg cases.

20

from the dismissal of their actions to the Ninth Circuit.

21

However, Brown deliberately chose to break away from the

22

other cases at this point, and did not appeal.

23

and state grounds?
MR. CHAPMAN:

No, Your Honor.

In Brown I, the

exactly identical to Brown II.

But there was only one legal

QUESTION:

MR. CHAPMAN:

12

Brown II was in the state court?
Brown II was originally filed in

the state court --

13

QUESTION:

And then removed?

14

MR. CHAPMAN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. CHAPMAN:

-- and then it was removed.

On the grounds of diversity?
It was removed on grounds of diver­

17

sity, of federal question, and then there was an additional

18

federal question -- ground -- that the -- the issue of the

19

scope and effect of the first judgment itself raised the

20

federal question.

21

QUESTION:

Now why do you -- what's the basis for

22

your argument that the state grounds alleged in Brown II

23

are barred by res judicata?

24

when they were first filed in the federal court, is that it?

25

MR. CHAPMAN:

Because they weren't stated

It's the standard principle of res

1

judicata, and I should say, Your Honor, that the -- both

2

courts below held -- we submit, correctly -- that if Brown

3

had been the only case that followed on the government

4

indictment, had it stood alone, the standard principles

5

of res judicata would apply.

And that can be stated and

6

has been stated in numerous cases in this Court, that a

7

final judgment -- it was a final judgment in Brown I --

8

precludes the refiling of the same claim on matters that

9

were raised or could have been raised in the initial case.
QUESTION:

10

Now, do you have a case that, right on,

11

that says if you file in the federal court and you state

12

only federal cause of action, and you lose, and then you

13

f ile in federal court a -- based on diversity, a state cause

14

of action based on the same facts, that res judicata bars

15

the second suit.
MR. CHAPMAN:

16

Yes, Your Honor.

There are specific

17

suits in the antitrust field which we have cited in our

18

reply brief.

20

came up the opposite way.

3

MR. CHAPMAN:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, res judicata --

But you might have lost. And would the

5

state court be entitled to, not to try those claims and

6

reject the res judicata claim?

7

MR. CHAPMAN:

Well, Your Honor, it is our under­

8

standing, and we have never seen anything contra.

to this

9

in any of the briefing or research in this case, that the

10

same standards as to res judicata which are applied in the

11

federal court are also applied in California.

12

that the state court --

13

QUESTION:

We believe

Well, what if California didn't?

14

And they went ahead and tried out their fraud claim? Now if

15

California would permit that to go ahead, shouldn't the

16

federal court permit it to go ahead if the case is removed,

17

on diversity grounds?

18

MR. CHAPMAN:

The federal court had a special

19

interest in connection with Brown II in determining and

20

avoiding circumvention of its initial judgment in Brown I.

21

The federal court had already -- there had been active

22

engagement in litigation in the federal court; it had de­

23

voted time and attention to these matters.

24

Justice White pointed out, there were state claims that

25

were before the federal court at the same time that Brown I
10

Indeed, as Mr.

1

was dismissed.

And it has -- consideration of both federal

2

and state claims.
Once the federal court

3

enters a judgment, this

4

is really the heart of our case, Mr. Justice White, the

5

rule of res judicata comes into play.

6

considerations in terms of avoiding vexatious and multiple

7

litigation, conserving judicial resources and promoting

8

respect for judgments, that come into play when-that final

There are crucial

It is

10

certainly, and we considered it so, and the District Court

1 1

considered it so, very much in the interest of the District

12

Court to protect its own judgment and to determine the scope

13

of that judgment.
QUESTION:

14

Do you think then that you can

15

get an injunction from the federal court if -- you should

16

have been able to enjoin the filing of Brown II In the state

17

court?
MR. CHAPMAN:

18

Yes, Your Honor.

We cite in our

19

reply brief the Fifth Circuit's decision in Woods Petroleum,

20

which was exactly that, where the Fifth Circuit held an

21

injunction by the district court against a state proceeding

22

based on an alleged state theory which was not but could

23

have been alleged as a pendent claim in a prior federal

24

case.

25

rationale that I've just spoken of -- that once there's a

And the Fifth Circuit, in Woods, adopted the same

11

1

final judgment in a federal court, the federal court does

2

have the right to protect that judgment.
QUESTION:

3

Well Mr. Chapman, supposing that in

4

federal court you have 30 days to file your notice of

5

appeal to the Court of Appeals, and in the California sys­

6

tem

7

from an adverse decision of the Superior Court; do you think

the principles of Angel v. Bullington and cases such as that

9

would require the federal court to adopt the 120-day principle

you have 120 days to file your notice of appeal

10

of California, rather than its own Federal Rules of Civil

11

Procedure?
MR. CHAPMAN:

12

No, Your Honor, by no means.

I think

13

that the procedural rules that govern the administration

14

and management of cases within the federal courts are

15

determined by federal law, and that the -- for example, the

16

30-day, or whatever period that's established in the Federal

17

Rules of Appellate Procedure -- by statute would cover

federal cases -- even though on substantive law matters,

22

They say that there's a -- the -- the timing and

23

manner in which the supposed state theories were raised in

24

Brown II, are very troublesome.

this is another basic thrust of the -- this doctrine against
splitting a cause of action

bring a case you should bring forth all your theories at

The complaint could have alleged state law

contemporaneously with Brown I, the Moitie case, which did

Let me say, Your Honor, that when the Defendants

argued for -- on the motion to dismiss before the district
court, and I am again talking about the first cases, Brown
I, Moitie I, the Weinberg seven cases -- we were faced with
some complaints that alleged Sherman Act violations, other
complaints that alleged Cartwright Act, California law
violations.

And we argued that the determining rule, that

is, the standard for determining business or property, was
13

the same under federal law as under California law.

12

the context I've just mentioned that even if you hold that

13

under federal law retail purchasers cannot, do not meet the

14

business or property standard -- that these Plaintiffs

15

could go forward under state law, that could have been done.

16

There could have been a motion to amend the complaint; the

17

federal rules are very liberal.

Supposing Brown had simultaneously filed his state law

either on the legal theory that the Plaintiffs weren't

MR. CHAPMAN:

10

the Ninth Circuit did?

1 1

there had only been the Brown case, that the normal standards

of res judicata -- and it didn't purport to distinguish

the refiling of Brown II.

Precisely.

here is that this was a federal judgment and the scope of

But it noted that the Weinberg cases, the other five federal
cases which were dismissed at the same time as Brown I, did
appeal.

They followed the orderly course and took their

case up to the Ninth Circuit.

Subsequently, this Court, in

Reiter v. Sonotone, held that under Section 4 of the Clayton
Act, retail purchasers do state a claim of injury to their bu:
ness or

property

and so on the basis of that, the Weinberg

cases were reversed by the Ninth Circuit and sent back to
the district court.

10

QUESTION:

Well wasn't Brown, when it was originally

1 1

filed in the state -- in the federal court, weren't the state
12

claims asserted only within the jurisdiction of the federal
13

court because of pendent jurisdiction?

Or what was it?

14

MR. CHAPMAN:

The state claims could have been

15

based on diversity or pendent jurisdiction; there was no
16

ajudication of that point.

The state claims were permissible

17

there because there was diversity jurisdiction.
18

QUESTION:

But none were alleged, I thought you

19

said?
20

MR. CHAPMAN:

In Brown there were none alleged.

In

21

five of the other cases, in two of the other cases they were
22

alleged.

But the key, Your Honor, if I may say this, is

that -24

QUESTION:

Well, your argument doesn't depend on

25

what happened in the other cases does it?
19

1

MR. CHAPMAN:

That's exactly the point.

But the

2

Ninth Circuit decision depends solely on what happened to

3

the other cases, and nothing else.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. CHAPMAN:

The Ninth Circuit ruled--

But Mr. Chapman --- solely that the only reason why

6

res judicata should be relieved in this case was that the

7

other cases were reversed on appeal.

8

that creates a premium for overriding the finality of judg­

9

ment in just the worst kind of cases where you have a

And we submit that

10

piling-on of multiple actions in the wake of a government

1 1

antitrust case, which is very typical.

12

that this case is here is because other parties in other

13

cases did appeal and did obtain a reversal.

14

that to allow relief from the finality of judgments because

15

of actions taken by other parties would only

impair the

Mr. Chapman, let me interrupt you again,

19

because there's a point of the precise way in which liti­

20

gation -- precise posture of litigation I'd like to clarify.

21

Under the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, as I understand it,

22

the district court is now free to try both the federal claim

23

and the state claim, do you read it that way?

24

MR. CHAPMAN:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

And your primary argument is they are
20

1

wrong in reinstating the federal claim on the basis of the

2

five other -- reversal of the five other cases.

3

not true that there is an entirely separate legal problem

4

as to whether or not the state claim survived, and isn't

5

that problem one we must answer by knowing how California

6

would interpret its doctrine of res judicata?
MR. CHAPMAN:

7

But is it

Well I would answer in two ways.

8

First, that the -- the answer is no, that is not what the

9

Ninth Circuit did.
QUESTION:

10
1 1

12

standing,

The Ninth Circuit understood -You just told me they are both still

both the state and federal claims are alive now.
MR. CHAPMAN:

The Ninth Circuit understood that

13

the application of res judicata would bar the entire claim

14

and the term claim is not -- we're not dealing with forms

15

of actions, it's the entire collection of rights and any

16

legal theories that arise out of this transaction.

17

The Ninth Circuit held that normally federal or

18

state claims would be barred if this were the only case.

19

it relieved Brown of res judicata, which opened up the

20

entire claim because of what happened in the other cases.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. CHAPMAN:

But

Well in that -May I say, there's no question but

23

that California law and federal law are absolutely identical

24

on what is meant by res judicata.

25

is that the Ninth Circuit refused to follow any of the

so all he could do on the basis of what had been filed

before him, is say well I don't think you are a proper plain­

tiff under Section 4.

20

MR. CHAPMAN:

On the contrary, Your Honor, the law

21

against splitting a cause of action makes it clear that

22

when plaintiffs bring their actions they cannot hold back

23

theories in their back pockets and try out -- try their luck

And the cases that we cite on the standard

must not be deprived of his opportunity to exercise dis­

5

cretion by not having the cases brought forward.

6

would also say that the district court did know, as counsel

concedes in his brief, that there was at least a potential­

ity of state cases at the time that Brown I was dismissed

9

because Moitie --

10

QUESTION:

And I

Wouldn't you -- on this very argument,

1 1

wouldn't you make a difference between claims that are

12

just pendent to a federal claim or that are arguably pendent,

13

and claims that could be brought originally in the federal

14

court based on diversity?

15

claims would independently be within the jurisdiction of the

16

federal court and --

17

Because then, these diversity

and there was diversity here.

MR. CHAPMAN:

There was diversity -- I think, the

18

important point, Your Honor, is this.

19

and we believe in this case that no issue with respect to

20

pendent jurisdiction is before this Court --

QUESTION:

22

MR. CHAPMAN:

If you don't have to,

MR. CHAPMAN:

QUESTION:

MR. CHAPMAN:

QUESTION:

Yes sir.

In the present posture of the case?
That's correct.

Only one question was raised in the

certiorari petition, only one question is addressed in your

original brief --

MR. CHAPMAN:

QUESTION:

That is correct.

-- and while the Respondent's brief

10

canvasses the issues that my brothers have asked you about,

11

that's not before us now, is it?

12

MR. CHAPMAN:

That -- you are precisely correct.

13

The question is to whether there is an exception from res

14

15

QUESTION:

But what if the question is did the

16

Court of Appeals -- if the question is, did the Court of

17

Appeals properly reinstate these judgments.

18

MR. CHAPMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

That's -- right?

The Court of Appeals -- the question--

That is the question, you say they should

not have reinstated either the state or the federal claims?
MR. CHAPMAN:

The question is whether the Court

22

of Appeals properly reversed the dismissal for res judicata.

23

The grounds, which were stated by the Court of Appeals, was

24

that res judicata would apply but for the action in the other

25

multiple cases.

And we say, Your Honor, that there is
24

absolutely no basis, indeed, Respondent presents no basis

for the novel ruling of the Court of Appeals in this case.

By Mine Worker v. Gibbs --

to me there was a discussion in the beginning of the opinion

1 1

where it said even if you were to get into the trial on the

merits of the cause, and the only merits we've had heard

are whether or not we had standing to maintain a cognizable

MR. OFFSTEIN:

In Brown I there was nothing to remand.

The Court sua sponte

invited the motion from the defense to dismiss for want
of standing under the Clayton Act.

That motion was briefed,

held under submission for a long time.

It was granted, the

actions were dismissed in their entirety.

I read Mine Worker

v. Gibbs, it said when there is nothing to append a state
claim to, you don't belong in federal court..

So we went to

the only other available forum, the court of general juris­
diction, the state courts, whose rules of res judicata -the facts at bar in this Merry v. Coast Community College
case, say we did the right thing.

brought up, irrespective of the narrow point, once the entire

file would be brought forward the ultimate reasoning of the

Court and the increments of its reasoning, .I've been led

15

to believe that this Court in particular deals with substance,

not form.

ORAL REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME

I. CHAPMAN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20
21

MR. CHAPMAN:

22

make two brief points.

23

in this petition is the Ninth Circuit's ruling that in multi­

24

ple-party actions, the appeal by certain parties relieves the

25

party who didn't appeal from the normal application of res
judicata.

I would like, Mr. Chief Justice, to
First, the issue that is presented

It's our submission, for the reasons in our briefs,
36

1

that this would create a tremendous hardship and burden in

2

the administration of complex, multiple-party class actions.

3

The Respondent's submission, Your Honor, would, if accepted,

4

create a burden in all cases, because he is arguing in favor

5

of piecemeal litigation, that you don't have to bring

6

forward once you come into a federal court, or whatever court

7

with your first complaint, you don't have to bring forward

8

all your theories, you don't have to bring forward all of

9

your rights for recovery, you don't have to give the district

10

court discretion to choose whether or not to handle all the

11

cases at one time.

12

by Respondents is not properly here, and we urge reversal

13

of the Ninth Circuit and reinstatement of the district

14

court's decision.

15

18

So we believe that the issue presented

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon at 11:47 o'clock a.m. the case in the
above matter was submitted.)
