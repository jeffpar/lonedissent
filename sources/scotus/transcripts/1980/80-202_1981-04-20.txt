MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2

We will hear arguments

3

first this morning in American Express Co. v. Koerner.

4

Mr. Greene, you may proceed whenever you are

5

ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. GREENE, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. GREENE:

8
9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case turns on what we view as a relatively

11

simple question of statutory construction.

12

the Court to construe the meaning of Section 104(1) of

13

the Truth-in-Lending Act.

14

tion from the entire Act for business credit transactions.

15

The precise statutory language is, "transactions involving

16

extensions of credit for business or commercial purposes."

17

It requires

That section provides an exemp­

The question before the Court today is whether

18

this language makes the Truth-in-Lending Act inapplicable

19

to the business credit cards issued by American Express

20

to the company for which Respondent works.

21

Now American Express says that the exemption

22

applies because the cards in question were business cards,

23

obtained by a business enterprise for business purposes.

24

Respondent counters that the exemption should not apply

25

because he, together with his employer, was jointly liable
3

1

for any charges on the account and because allegedly, on

2

some occasions he used the card to make personal purchases.
Now, time permitting, there are three basic points

3
4

that I'd like to cover this morning.

First, I'd like to

5

review briefly the precise statutory language that we

6

feel is dispositive.

7

clearly and without any equivocation, exempts all business

8

card systems from the Truth-in-Lending Act.

It is our position that this language

Second, I'd like to discuss the position that

9
10

the Federal Reserve Board has taken on the issues before

11

the Court.

12

Milhollin, the rulings of the Federal Reserve Board are,

13

we think, dispositive.

14

Under this Court's decision in Ford Motor v.

And finally, I'd like to touch on the fundamen­

15

tal policy considerations that we think are reflected in

16

the business credit exemption.

17

decision which we've asked this Court to reverse is partic­

18

ularly troublesome because it reflects

19

to these fundamental policy considerations.

20

because it might lead to the imposition of an exceptionally

21

complicated and convoluted regulatory scheme in an area

22

where Congress and the Federal Reserve Board never thought

23

that it should be applied.

24

in this area would impose wholly unnecessary regulatory

25

costs in an area that Congress specifically decided it

And the Fifth Circuit

this case; it comes here on a motion for summary judgment

4

that was granted by the District Court.

5

Respondent, was an officer of the John E. Koerner S Co.

6

In 1965, the company applied to American Express for issu­

7

ance of a company card for Mr. Koerner's use.

8

employees also were to receive cards; five cards were

9

ultimately issued on this account.

Mr. Koerner, the

Other

American Express

10

checked out the company's credit, and issued all five cards.

1 1

It also obtained Mr. Koerner's individual signature, and

12

that made him liable together with the company for any

13

charges on his particular card -- not on the other four

14

cards, but on his particular card.
QUESTION:

15

Did the company investigate the

16

credit rating of any of Mr. Koerner -- or of any of the

17

other four employees?

18

MR. GREENE:

No, Mr. Justice, just the company.

19

If you look at the application form which is in the joint

20

appendix on page 27a, you will see that there are listed

21

there credit references of the company, Whitney National

22

Bank, Hibernia National Bank, and so on.

23

Milling Company.

24

and it was the company's credit that stood behind the

25

account.

International

These are credit references of the company

5

You will also see from that application form that

it notes in -QUESTION:

3

Well, you say that the company stood

4

behind it.

looking only to the corporation, not to the individuals?

6

Are you suggesting that American Express was

MR. GREENE:

Well technically, the individual

7

employees were jointly liable with the company for any

8

charges on their particular cards.

9

out, Mr. Chief Justice, was that the credit checks that

10

were made and that are made, for company cards, look to

11

the company's credit worthiness as the basis for --

12

QUESTION:

What I was pointing

Well, what I was trying to clarify,

13

because I wasn't sure what you meant, is there any differ­

14

ence in the relationship between American Express and Mr.

15

Koerner, and American Express and the other four men?

16

MR. GREENE:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. GREENE:

19

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
Individually.
No.
How about the relationship between

20

the individual and the company, and the individual and

21

American Express; could American Express have gone after

22

him for the personal charges?

23

MR. GREENE:

It could have, Mr. Justice.

As a

24

matter of practice, it does not, it goes after the company.

25

In this case, the record reflects that all the bills
6

1

were sent to the company at the company address.

2

correspondence relating to the billing error inquiries

3

were between the company bookkeeper and American Express.

4

Ordinarily, with these accounts, it is the company that

5

is primarily involved.

MR. GREENE:

The purpose for the individual liability is primarily to

assure the company, the Koerner Company, in this case,

11

against misuse of the cards by their employees.

21

in these company card situations is that American Express

What does the record show as to the

No, there were apparently some

6

instances where personal checks of the employees were also

7

sent, as well as company checks.
QUESTION:

10
1 1

Well, are we to infer from that that

sometimes the employees used it for personal purposes ,
and then paid with a personal check, but when it was for
a

corporate purpose it was paid for by a corporate check?
MR. GREENE:

12

Well, that's possible, Mr. Chief

13

Justice.

The record does not reflect that.

14

that is irrelevant to the case, however.

15

in our mind, as far as the application of the business

16

credit exemption is concerned is whether the card was

17

issued for a business purpose, not whether it was used for

18

a business purpose.

19

is

20

in-Lending Act, or whether it is exempt.

21

tant reason is found in Section 127 of the Truth-in-Lending

22

Act which requires initial disclosures to be sent to all

23

cardholders before the first transaction on the account.

24

So you have to send out these initial disclosures before

25

any charges have been made at all.

opened,

In our view,

The question is,

A creditor must know when a credit card

whether the account is covered by the TruthThe most impor­

And the creditor has

1

2
3
4

6
7

8
9
10
1 1

12
13
14

to know, at that time, whether the card is going to be
covered by the Act and therefore the disclosures have to
be sent, or whether it's exempt.

And the Federal Reserve

Board has taken precisely this position in its newly
issued Regulation Z, which came out just a couple of weeks
ago, where it, in its new definition of cardholder, defines
a cardholder as a person to whom a card is issued for
consumer credit purposes.

The question is the purpose

for the issuance of the card, it's a prospective kind of
test.

It's very similar to a situation outside the credit

card area where you might have a loan that's taken out at
the bank.

The lender at the time the loan is taken out

must make the decision because of the Truth-in-Lending
disclosures.

And he hands over the loan proceeds and

15

once the customer leaves the bank he could use that money

16

for whatever he pleases.
QUESTION:

17

Well, Hr. Greene, there are -- do you

18

-- does the company make the disclosures every time it

19

issues a new card, every year?
MR. GREENE:

20

Yes, Your Honor.

It makes the

21

initial disclosures before the first use of the card and

22

then American Express, at least, makes new disclosures

23

each year.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. GREENE:

Must it?

Must it?

Well it must make initial disclosures

I suppose this card was reissued every year?
MR. GREENE:

QUESTION:

5

MR. GREENE:

6

Well I'm asking you how about on reissue?

A renewal card was sent.
Yes.

And there are disclosures then?

There are disclosures.

I don't

7

believe they are required, except where there's a change

8

in terms.

9

QUESTION:

Well, suppose a card like this is

10

never used for business purposes, as it turns out, it's

1 1

used completely for personal use.

12

employee makes the payments directly to the company.

13

MR. GREENE:

It never -- and the

Well, American Express would have

14

no way of knowing what the card was being used for, or

15

whether those purchases are personal or business; all it

16

gets are copies of the credit card slips from the merchant.

17

They can't tell whether that's a personal use or a business

18

use; it has to rely upon the representations that are made

19

to it at the time the account is issued.

20

the application form which Mr. Koerner signed and which

21

the company signed as well, clearly labels the application

22

as one for a company account.

23

Perhaps I could --

QUESTION:

25

And in this case,

Even though every payment -- the payment

for every charge on the card is made by him personally, and

And it's a matter that has to be

determined at the outset, before the account is used.
QUESTION:

Well, your --

that argument depends

22

upon the hypothesis, does it not, that the extension of

23

credit occurs when the card is issued?

24

MR. GREENE:

25

QUESTION:

Well an extension of credit -Yes.
11

1

MR. GREENE:

2

QUESTION:

-- certainly occurs then.

I wouldn't-

And I thought of a credit card, or

3

at least it can be argued, that a credit card is no more

4

than an agreement to extend credit in the future.

5

MR. GREENE:

Well, the definition of credit

6

contained in the Truth-in-Lending Act is broad enough so

7

that the opening of an account has to be viewed as an

8

extension of credit.

9

QUESTION:

MR. GREENE:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GREENE:

15
16
17

Even though the card is put by the

cardholder into his desk drawer and never used?

11

14

If it weren't --

Well certainly -That's an extension of credit?
-- an extension of credit is the

right to defer payment.
QUESTION:

It's not -- well, it's an agreement

to extend credit in the future, is it not?
MR. GREENE:

Yes, and that constitutes an exten­

18

sion of credit.

20

say, refused to open accounts for women, under the Equal

21

Credit Act, the refusal to open an account for a woman

would be a refusal to extend credit and would give her a

right of action.

an extension of credit.

as being for business -- that brings you within the exemption ?

That wouldn't change your case.
No, it wouldn't.

Because the credit

I should point out, that American Express issues

two kinds of cards:

like 90 percent of the cards.

Perhaps, if I -- if we look a little bit at the

end, consumer credit plans, that's the statui dry language.

Now, an open-end credit plan by its very nature involves

So, the creditor has to know, to comply with that

MR. GREENE:

5

If there were an issue of material

fact, but we don't believe there is an issue of material

7

fact because of the explicit agreement among the three

8

involved parties:

9

and American Express Company, a contract that this was to

the John Koerner Company, Louis Koerner

10

be a company account and a stipulation during discovery that

1 1

all billing was done as a business account.

12

that's sufficient to support summary judgment.

13

judgment is really the common mode of proceeding in most

14

of these Truth-in-Lending cases, because in most cases the

15

issues will turn on a construction of contractual agree­

16

ments or language in a form, and it is not at all unusual

17

for cases to come up in summary judgment contexts.

18

Mourning v. Family Publications Services, Inc. case that

19

this Court decided was a summary judgment case.

This is a case in which a man of principle was embarrassed

8

for no reason by employees of American Express as impersonal

9

as the computers that they served.

This is a lack of --

10

this case arose because of a lack of good manners and proper

1 1

etiquette and breakdown of proper business practices.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Although the Truth-in-Lending Act

doesn't deal with proper busines etiquette, does it?
MR. KOERNER:

Well in a way, this -- the Fair

15

Credit Billing Act in a way does.

What they've done is,

16

they've imposed as a matter of law, what is ordinarily good

17

practice, which the legislative history suggests that most

18

creditors have done anyway.

19

That's the reason I mentioned that.

20

QUESTION:

Well but you wouldn't suggest that

21

an argument over a bill or an argument over a plane reser­

22

vation or something like that paid for with a credit card

23

would come within the Truth-in-Lending Act simply because

24

it was a violation of good etiquette?

25

MR. KOERNER:

No, not at all.
21

What happened is --

in the record either way as to whether that was done.

you remember Mr. Greene's response to Your Honors' questions

QUESTION:

My father is well known to the Whitney

But the credit information was sub­

mitted only with respect to the corporation?
MR. KOERNER:

Correct.

But it is very simple,

16

particularly in 1965, to simply run a credit check on the

17

mainly liable individuals.

18

And in addition to that, if they didn't want

19

some credit of the individuals, why make them co-principals

20

and jointly and severally liable?

21

that eventually -- one other thing that's interesting about

22

this is that the credit card application was in 1965, which

23

is several years predating the Truth-in-Lending Act, so

24

what American Express wishes us to do is to look back to

25

a time in the past when the Truth-in-Lending Act had not

the parties.

American Express did send the company a -- let's see,

that was an estoppel on American Express, because that

wouldn't affect the statutory construction.

But it is

1 1

evidence of the will of the parties, that is, one of the

12

only manifestations that the parties have made that there

13

is some will that this should be -- considered consumer

credit.
Now, in 1975, because of lack of use by Mr.

15
16

John E. Koerner, Jr. and personal use by my cousin,

In addition to that, there was flight

Company, for the personal -- for the flight insurance.
My father authorized payment for a while, sending letters
saying, do something.

But then it got to the point where

he felt that it wouldn't do any good and that the only way
to get their attention was just to simply not pay and send
them a letter explaining why they would not pay, which is
the procedure that is set up under the Act.
Now, in September of 1976, which is the month of

QUESTION:

23

for

Mr. Koerner, could I interrupt you

a second?

24

MR. KOERNER:

25

QUESTION:

Certainly.

What is your basic theory here?
25

Is

1

it that the individual is jointly liable on the account,

2

or is it that the individual made some personal use of

3

the account.

4

MR. KOERNER:

5

QUESTION:

6

Both.

Okay, first --

Do you require both, or -- under the

statute ?

7

MR. KOERNER:

No, I don't think we require both.

8

However, we have both.

9

and severally liable, which -- I don't know what the common

The first thing is, he's jointly

11

principal.

QUESTION:

12
13

So that's one -I understand.

But how does -- we have

to relate it back to the statute.
MR. KOERNER:

14

Okay, the statute protects con­

15

sumers.

16

The credit card application talks about joining in the

17

application with the company, but my Uncle John, he was an

18

individual applicant.

19

to the company, jointly, with his name on it and with the

20

company's name on it.

21

22

He is a consumer, the card was issued to him.

QUESTION:

So the card was issued to him and

So under that construction, you would

win, if all of the transactions were business transactions?

23

MR. KOERNER:

24

QUESTION:

25

That is one possibility.

The other possibility is that if there's

any one personal transaction on the account, you would win

even if he weren't jointly liable, I suppose?
MR. KOERNER:

2
3

nice to have both

Correct.

though.

But that's -- I think it's

But what happens here is that

4

there's -- in addition to that, on the revocation there

5

were no extensions of credit.

6

QUESTION:

Can you summarize in about two

7

sentences what you think American Express should have done

8

under the statute here which it did not do?
MR. KOERNER:

9

QUESTION:

10
1 1

14
15
16
17

Apologize?

Isn't that the word you

used?
MR. KOERNER:

12
13

Acknowledge the dispute.

Yes sir.

But that -- even an

apology afterwards would have worked.
remember

But beforehand,

this---

there's a year of correspondence between the

company, on behalf of my father and American Express.
QUESTION:

The statute does a whole lot of things,

but it doesn't require apologies, does it?

18

MR. KOERNER:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. KOERNER:

No.

Well, then what does the statute require
The statute requires that while

21

there is a dispute, and American Express, the issuer is

22

notified of the dispute, that they do not revoke the card

23

until they take certain steps, that's all.

24

25

QUESTION:

And that's what you claim was erron­

eously done here, when the credit card was cut in two?
27

MR. KOERNER:

1

Correct.

In other words, what

2

happened is that -- as a matter of fact, after the date of

3

the revocation there was no further money paid on the

4

account, because., the account was credited in full by

5

American Express.

6

were acknowledged and credited out, as having been improper.

In this particular case, if you win?
Okay.

In Louisiana --

your client.
MR. KOERNER:

It will reverse the summary judgment.

19

I don't think there's any money to be involved, because the

20

remedy under the Act is if there is a dispute.

21

I can see, there's a dispute and they don't acknowledge

22

it, whatever is in dispute the company waives.

23

QUESTION:

From what

And, since there isn't any money

involved, what happens?
MR. KOERNER:

QUESTION:

So it's just kind of a -- like

they

2

used to say in Michigan, litigation was the winter sport

3

of farmers.

4

MR. KOERNER:

Well, of course what happens is

5

that we have a public interest in this, is that, we are

6

appearing in a way, as a private attorney general seeking

7

to enforce a right of consumers under the Act.

8

9

pocket expenses, under, I think it's 15 U.S.C. 1640.

And the

And

10

so, it's not -- what's happened is that we have undergone

11

a great deal of time -- trouble --

12
13

QUESTION:

Well let's see, the Court of Appeals

reversed the summary judgment?

14

MR. KOERNER:

15

QUESTION:

16

Correct.

So now you're supposed to go back to

the trial court?

17

MR. KOERNER:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. KOERNER:

Precisely.

What happens in the trial court?
We decide whether we wish to go

20

forward with a certification of a class, or whether at that

21

point the case should be over.

22

there's no dispute that the billings in question were in

23

error, they've been credited out.

24

relief was voluntarily granted.

25

QUESTION:

What happened is that

So the first prong of the

I know, but won't the District Court
29

1

2
3
4

have to agree with that proposition?
MR. KOERNER:

It is stipulated by the parties.

I believe those facts are stipulated.
QUESTION:

What's the -- what stake does your

5

client have in this controversy now that would qualify as

6

Article III standing?

7

8
9

10
11

MR. KOERNER:

He's paid me, we've paid costs

as

we've gone along, in addition, he's incurred attorneys fees.
QUESTION:

Mr. Koerner, you filed this as a

class action, didn't you?
MR. KOERNER:

Correct.

And also we have, the class

12

has an interest in the outcome of it also, both retrospec­

13

tive and prospective relief.

14

QUESTION:

And has the class been certified?

15

MR. KOERNER:

16

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

That was because the District Court

17

ruled against you on the merits?

18

MR. KOERNER:

19

QUESTION:

Precisely.

So now, I suppose, on remand it would

20

be open to certify a class and recover the ten million

21

dollars or whatever it is you sued for, isn't it?

22

MR. KOERNER:

23

tation of $100,000.

24

QUESTION:

25

I think there's a statute of limi­

Ten thousand dollars.

Whatever it is,

but if there are other members of the class who have a
30

1

similar claim, I suppose the case is not moot, is it?
MR. KOERNER:

2

Oh no, it's not moot.

As a matter

3

of fact, after the decision of the Court of Appeals we filed

4

for certification of the class, and when the mandate was

5

stayed, we suspended the action in the District Court.
One of the arguments that American Express makes

6
7

talks about the legislative history.

It's obvious that

8

the Fair Credit Billing Act was part,

9

Truth-in-Lending Act, and that 1603 should not be applicable.

in a way,

in the

10

The legislative history of the new amendments is very

11

interesting, because what happens is that there were two

12

titles to it, that's--there were three.

13

incorporated the 1974 amendments, one of which was the

14

revocation provision.

15

amendments that were talked about from a year before, from

16

the -- and what happened in the legislative history it's

S 2616, they said, "to remove any possible uncertainty

18

relating to the coverage of all credit cards under the

19

Act's credit card amendments Section 135 should be added as

20

follows..." -- and then they exempted from the first three

21

of the '70, but they never ever thought about the '74 Act.

22

And what happened is, we have an act that was, I don't think

23

anybody ever really considered the effect of what they were

24

doing.

25

should have thought more fully about the consequences of

The first title

And there were some technical

And I think under those circumstances, they really

31

1

whether the business exemption might be contended to be

2

applicable to the '74 amendments.

3

that the '74 amendment with regard to revocation is like the

4

unauthorized use in that you don't have a credit trans­

5

action and that it's only to credit transactions that the

6

exemption would apply under any circumstances.

QUESTION:

This was not decided by the District

Court or the Court of Appeals, was it?
MR. KOERNER:

Now, my contention is

What was?

I'm sorry?

The inapplicability?
The Court of Appeals said it was

QUESTION:

Yes.

event this particular provision

32

QUESTION:

1

2

Did you urge it in the Court of

Appeals ?
MR. KOERNER:

3

Certainly.

That was the main con­

4

tention that we urged and it was only as an alternative

5

that the Fifth Circuit took the idea that under the Louisiana

6

law, the man was a consumer because of the in solido pro­

7

visions, and the agreement between the parties.

8

American Express' argument at the present time

9

is that you should go all the way back to 1965 to try to

10

decipher, give a presumption of the agreement of the parties.

11

But it seems like a total fiction.

card has been used for personal purposes because they paid

MR. KOERNER:

QUESTION:

Because personal checks were sent

Yes.

Does American Express have an obli­

21

gation to find out whether the credit was extended for the

22

purchase of perfume in Paris or an airline ticket, or what?

23

MR. KOERNER:

No.

But I think that what we’re

24

doing is wd're looking for any objective manifestation of

25

the will of the parties, rather than using the fiction.

Mr. Koerner, if you wait till the

account is paid, isn't that too late for them to comply

10

with the

pre-extension of credit disclosure requirement?

11

If you rely on the fact that they paid the check personally,

12

that's a little late for them to comply with the statute,

13

isn't it?
MR. KOERNER:

14

Yes.

In a way, that's true.

But

15

what happens here is we have a relationship that predates

16

the statute, so at some point or other in the relationship,

17

they had to make a decision on whether to comply or not.
QUESTION:

18

You're assuming the computer can

KOERNER:

The reason was to avoid the company

MR. KOERNER:

I cannot expect to be bound by 1965.

ORAL REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. GREENE, ESQ.,

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. GREENE:

Just a few minor points.

First of

20

all, this is not from American Express' standpoint, an aca­

21

demic dispute.

22

The complaint talked about 10 million or something like

23

that, but --

24

25

We were sued for half a million dollars.

QUESTION:

What happens if you lose, we affirm?

What goes on in the District Court?
41

1

2

MR. GREENE:

It will go back to the District Court

and the District Court will have to decide whether to certi­

3

fy the case as a class action.

4

action, then under Section 130 of the Truth-in-Lending Act

5

6
7

there are statutory damages of $500,000 for the class;
$500,000 or one percent of the net worth of the.creditor,
whichever is less.

8

QUESTION:

9

certify the class, then what?

10

If it is certified as a class

MR. GREENE:

And.suppose the Court refuses to

Then it would go forward as an

11

individual action, as to Mr. Koerner, and there are statu­

12

tory damages there of $100.

13

QUESTION:

How about the damages for humiliation,

14

ripping your card up, and all that sort of thing?

15

independently, or is that --

16
17

MR. GREENE:

Is that

Well, there would be arguments as

to whether the $100 statutory damages --

18

QUESTION: Was all ?

19

MR. GREENE:

-- would preclude such other damages.

20

So we were in this case, defending it, not because we didn't

21

want to apologize to somebody, but because we were sued for

22

a half a million dollars.

23

Now, the second --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. GREENE:

But you didn't want to apologize?
Well, I don't know.
42

On that point,

1

Mr. Koerner said that it was undisputed that we had vio­

2

lated the law.

3

arises on a motion for summary judgment, and I think the

4

Court has to assume that if the Act applies it was violated.

5

But if it were remanded

6

to put on evidence that would show that we did in fact

7

violate the law, that there was a dispute, that it was

8

properly sent in, there's an extremely technical definition

of what has to be a proper written notification of a billing

11
12

That's not entirely correct.

It's in my records.
I would think he alleged the facts and

that you either denied them or admitted them?
MR. GREENE:

We certainly filed a motion to dismiss

on summary judgment, you have to assume the facts.
QUESTION:

Mr. Greene, let me just ask you a

24

question about -- I think Judge Wisdom's theory.

25

it perfectly clear that the only consideration for the
43

Why isn't

1

2

guarantee -- it isn't a guarantee -- but the joint
responsibility for the account on the part of the individ­

3

ual, was that the individual was going to get individual

4

credit for consumer purposes, for non-business purposes.

5

MR. GREENE:

6

QUESTION:

7

He's not a surety, as I understand

your -MR. GREENE:

8
9

That's not --

That's not clear at all.

I think the

basic problem with Judge Wisdom's contention is that he

10

seems to equate individual liability with the fact that you

1 1

have a consumer credit transaction covered by the Act.
QUESTION:

12

Well what could the individual possibly

13

be doing for which he would accept individual liability

14

that -MR. GREENE:

15

Oh, Mr. Justice, that happens all

16

the time.

17

a common practice for creditors to require individual s ,

18

especially in cases of small businesses, new businesses,

19

unincorporated businesses, to assume liability for business

20

debts.

21

In all -- as pointed out in our brief, that it's

Yes.

No, but it might well with the

QUESTION:

;

It seems to me that the most frequent

16

situation where you have an individual on a company card is

17

that everybody expects him to use it for personal purposes.

18

MR. GREENE:

Well, you might assume that, but

19

in this case, we have a contract that says that it's a

20

business account, and the record doesn't reflect that.

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
