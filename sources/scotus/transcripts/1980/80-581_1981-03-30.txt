ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. ROGERS, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ROGERS:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a challenge to a Montana tax based on the

10
1 1

Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause,

The tax was

12

enacted in 1975.

13

in Montana, including a net proceeds tax, a property tax,

14

license tax, and a severance tax.

15

received royalties from the Federal Government to cover the

16

impact of mining coal in Montana.

17

mindful of the problems they had with Anaconda Copper and

18

earlier, provided that the coal companies had to reclaim the

19

land as they mined and they had to post substantial bonds to

20

guarantee that the land would be properly reclaimed.

Prior to 1975 there was an array of taxes

In addition, the state

And the coal companies --

21

So presumably, the taxes on the books at that time

22

were sufficient to meet the cost of the services provided by

23

Montana.

24

tax -- in 1973 the severance tax had been increased from

25

10 cents a ton, based on BTU, to approximately 34 cents a ton.

In fact -- and I point out that this tax was a 1975

3

Shortly thereafter, the Arab oil embargo occurred

1

2

and it became clear.that the nation was facing a very serious

3

energy crisis.

4

more than 25 percent of the coal reserves in the United States

5

and it started to plan how it could maximize its taxes.

6

The spirit in which it was done was exemplified by one of its

7

sponsors in the House of Representatives when he said, the

8

Arabs have the oil but we have the coal.

So Montana saw an opportunity.

Montana has

Most of this coal is shipped out of the state;

9

90

10

percent of it, in fact.

1 1

term contracts, so the discussion in the Legislature for the

12

most part involved the question, how much would the market

13

bear?

14

would not be subject to any judicial review.

15

And the coal is leased under long­

The Legislature was advised that the amount of the tax

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Rogers, are you suggesting

16

that the State of Montana could not have doubled its severance

17

tax at any particular time?

18

MR. ROGERS:

No, we're not.

We're claiming that,

19

actually, Montana in this cases did not meet the tests of

20

Complete Auto and Washington Stevedoring.

21

that they're not entitled to tax.

22

cause it was specifically tailored to fall on customers out­

23

side the state has to be fairly related to the services pro­

24

vided by Montana.

25

QUESTION:

We don't claim

W7e think that the tax be­

The result of this tax -In any event, there was no challenge to

the lower rate periods?
MR. ROGERS:

None.

And I might say, parentheti­

3

cally, there would not have been.

tax that --

7

QUESTION:

It was the amount of this

According to the courts below, have you

conceded that a 50 percent tax would be -- ?
MR. ROGERS:

No, we have not, Your Honor.

That is

8

a misstatement.

We said that we could not imagine that a tax,

9

that a severance tax of 12-1/2 percent would ever be more

10

than enough.

1 1

well, my studies show that no matter how they figured the

12

cost of the services that might be necessary to provide for a-d-

13

dirional mining of coal, that it could never amount to more

14

than 10 cents a ton additional.

15

We think that probably in this case a tax --

QUESTION:

But then isn't that going to make it a

16

case-by-case adjudication in every situation where the federal

17

courts decide whether a tax is or is not -- ?

18

MR. ROGERS:

No, I would not think so, Your Honor.

19

We think that in a case like this -- and I'll come to this in

20

just a moment -- that it was deliberately tailored to fall on

21

people outside the state and it's under long-term contracts

22

-- the coal companies couldn't get out of those contracts --

23

plus the fact that Montana has 25 percent of all the nation's

24

coal resources and it has over 50 percent of the low sulfur

25

coal in the United States.
5

1

Now, we say, under those circumstances, because it's

2

a tailored tax and because it falls to a large extent -- 90

3

percent of the tax is paid for by people in other states --

4

that we are entitled to a trial to show that by no stretch

5

of the imagination can Montana show that they need this money

6

for the services that are provided by Montana.

7

QUESTION:

8

to prove your case?

9

That's really all you want, is a chance

MR. ROGERS:

That is all.

Now, it's interesting,

10

too, that the -- let me say before I get to that, so far this

11

tax has amounted -- this tax; not the other taxes; this tax --

12

has amounted to about $200 million.

13

amount to over a billion dollars in the next ten years and

14

several billions of dollars in the next 20 years.

15

prepared to prove these things.

16

study made which showed to our satisfaction that there's no

17

justification for this tax.

18

QUESTION:

They expect the tax will

And we're

We have had a comprehensive

But wouldn't the same have been true

19

20 or 30 or 40 years ago in Oklahoma or Texas with respect to

20

a severance tax on oil?

21

MR. ROGERS:

Well, I really can't answer that ques­

22

tion, Your Honor.

23

attempted to do what they've done here.

24

that Montana amended their constitution to provide a trust

25

fund to put the money in, and they're putting one-half of all

I can't imagine that any state would have

6

Let me say, too,

1

this money in a trust fund.

2

to claim that they need the money.
QUESTION:

3
4

They don't make any real effort

Does a state have to make a claim that

it needs the money in order to exercise the taxing power?
MR. ROGERS:

5

Well, as we read Complete Auto, and

6

Washington Stevedoring, the Court has held that there are

7

four prongs to the test:

8

tionment test, neither of which come into play here; third,

9

the discrimination test, and this case clearly shows the

10

one, the nexus test; one, the appor­

discrimination here.
Let me just read what the Senator said who proposed

11

12

the tax, if I can find it.

13

-- and this is in the legislative history, that this tax was

14

going to be paid for initially by the coal companies but be­

15

cause of the contracts it would be immediately paid for by

16

the utilities, who in turn under the law passed that on to the

17

customers.

18

Chicago, in Detroit, Minneapolis, and other cities and towns.

20

So, the tax is being paid for by the customers in

QUESTION:

19

But anyway, he pointed out that

Well, why isn't it being paid by Montana

consumers too?
MR. ROGERS:

21

Well, it is to some extent, of

22

course, but it's -- they get so much money back from the re­

23

mainder of the tax, it's for -- let me say this, Justice

24

White.

25

Montana, believe me.

This is the most popular tax in the history of

QUESTION:

Well, it's probably resulted in lowering

of some other taxes or at least --

3

MR. ROGERS:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ROGERS:

It has --- they've had some increases?
It has resulted in considerable lower­

6

ing of taxes, and they plan in the years ahead not to have to

7

pay any taxes at all.

8

Stevedoring mean anything -- and I think this Court intended

9

those cases to mean something -- it means for the state, once

Now, if Complete Auto and Washington

10

it decides to tax interstate commerce, has to do it in a

11

nondiscriminatory way, in a way that's fairly related to the

12

services of protection provided by the state.

13

to show that this tax amounts to between $2 and $4 a ton and

14

that the state by no stretch of the imagination can justify

15

more than 20 cents a ton, if they take into account schools

16

and roads and hospitals and everything else they might claim.

17

We're prepared

Furthermore, because of the trust fund, they know

18

they can't establish that.

I mean, the papers in Montana are

19

full of how do they spend the other 50 percent?

20

found out a way to spend the other 50 percent in any manner

21

that's consistent with the --

22

QUESTION:

What if we agreed with you?

They haven't

What would

23

you contemplate we would say if we agreed with you?

24

that under Brady and the Auto case that that fourth category

25

assumes that a tax can be too high on interstate commerce?
8

Namely,

1

MR. ROGERS:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes.
And that therefore you ought to have a

chance to prove that it's too high?

4

MR. ROGERS:

5

QUESTION:

That's exactly right.
But then, the premise for that is that it

6

may be that 30 percent is too high.

7

decide that.

8

MR. ROGERS:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. ROGERS:

1 1

QUESTION:

12

We have to at least

That's right.
And how do we know that?
Well, we’ll -You're going to -- you would convince

the Court of that?

13

MR. ROGERS:

We're going to convince the Court of

14

that.

15

states will defy the standards established by this Court.

16
17
18

Secondly, I don't think that the legislatures of the

QUESTION:

Well, the question is, what standards

can we establish?
MR. ROGERS:

Oh, I think, Your Honor, that you have

19

established a standard, a fairly related standard.

20

in Complete Auto that if a state -- first, you say clearly

21

that the state has the right to tax interstate commerce, and

22

in Complete Auto you wipe away the distinctions about labels.

23

And you said, let's consider the practical effect of a tax,

24

which seems to most lawyers, it's a very sensible position.

25

Now, the practical effects of this tax -- and you
9

You say

1

don't have to take my word for it, you can look at the legis­

2

lative history -- is, in the first instance, to transfer the

3

tax from people in Montana to out-of-state taxpayers who ob­

4

viously were not part of the political process.
QUESTION:

5

6

Second --

There are people in Montana who are

paying taxes.

7

MR. ROGERS:

Yes, of course, but they get back so

8

much in the rest of it that, as I said, they've very happy to

9

pay for it.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Rogers, I agree with what I think

1 1

you're arguing.

12

don't know how I can sustain it, and that is that I can decide

13

what the tax is going to be on me.

14

I can't sustain it, and is that not what you are arguing?

I mean, I thoroughly agree with you, but I

15

MR. ROGERS:

16

QUESTION:

17

I mean, I'm for that, but

No, Your Honor -You want a hearing which will determine

how much your tax is to be?

18

MR. ROGERS:

No, Justice Marshall, that -is not.

My

19

argument is that when a tax, as this one does, affects inter­

20

state commerce --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ROGERS:

Assuming that's true --- that it should be fairly related to

23

the cost and services provided by'the states, a rough equiva­

24

lence.

25

We don't say that -QUESTION:

Will the Court be asked to fix a rate?

is as follows.

MR. ROGERS:

I'd love to have the right to fix my own

rate of taxes.

In this case the Legislature has no record --

Well, will the Court be asked to fix a

Mo, Your Honor, we think that --

I guess we all would.
Mine would be on a scale of one to ten

MR. ROGERS:

In this case there was no legislative

the amount of the tax.

I've said, to fall on people outside the state.

advantage of the crisis.

19

say that the Legislature had not followed the standards laid

20

down by this Court, that in this kind of a case, where the

21

facts are specifically tailored, there should be special

22

scrutiny given --

23

QUESTION:

We would expect the Court merely to

Isn't there some language in the Supreme

24

Court's opinion about its fear of the consequences of strip

25

mining and of the process of restoration?
11

MR. ROGERS:

1

Yes, but in this case, as I have said,

2

the state has already provided for reclamation cost, plus

3

the fact that the amount of land that's involved in this is

4

very small.

5

land that's involved in this strip mining is five square

6

miles.
QUESTION:

8

The amount of

belong to Montana anyway, does it?

That's correct, Your Honor. In

Now, we say that under those circum­

23

MR. ROGERS:

Maybe I should amend■that to say that

a couple of hundred very large parks, municipal zoos, and all

10

sorts of public things they never have done before, would

1 1

that be justifiable?
MR. ROGERS:

12

Well, I think that because of the other

13

taxes that they've already imoosed on the mining of coal, the

QUESTION:

Before you sit down, though, let me

3

ask one other question.

4

Solicitor General's argument that the best arm of government

5

to draft the right standard is Congress rather than this

6

Court?
MR. ROGERS:

7

What is your response to the

Well, there are two arguments, I think.

8

Justice Stevens.

One, although we recognize that Congress has

9

a part to play, we think that the constitutional issue should

10

be decided by the Court and secondly, if that was the rule,

1 1

it would be very difficult for Congress to anticipate and

12

preempt all the schemes that the states could dream up in

13

advance.

14

QUESTION:

But don't you agree that if Congress

15

passed a statute that specifically approved the Montana tax,

16

that you would lose this case?

17

over today and it said that Congress has just passed a law

18

and the President has just signed it approving the Montana

19

tax?

20
21

MR. ROGERS:

Yes, I sure wouldn't be here; yes.

But I can't imagine that Congress is going to --

QUESTION:

23

MR. ROGERS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Suppose someone sent a message

No, probably not.

•

Do you think so?
But Congress can certainly eliminate the

constitutional issue if it wants to.
15

MR. ROGERS:

1

Oh, yes; surely, surely.

But what

2

I'm saying is, it would be very difficult to eliminate the

3

constitutional issues in advance, Justice White, and we don't

4

think that's the way to do it.

5

here was that the Legislature in Montana was advised that

6

they would have no legal problems, that the courts would not

7

challenge this tax, and if -- I am satisfied that if the

8

Legislature had been advised that this tax was going to be

9

subject to judicial scrutiny, that we wouldn't be here today

10

As I say, one of the oroblems

because the tax would have been much less.
When Montana imposed this tax it was four times as

1 1
12

large as any severance tax in the nation.

So this is an ex­

13

cessive, exorbitant tax, and we would like to have a trial

14

to prove it.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL T. GREELY, ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. GREELY:

18
19

Mr. Attorney General.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I*d like to focus the Courtis attention today on

20
21

the actual allegations that the appellants declared in their

22

complaint because there have been a lot of facts bandied

23

about

24

the appellants as to what the allegations were and what kind

25

of facts the appellants could prove if they'd gone to trial.

both in the briefs and suggested today by counsel for

16

First of all, I think it's important to note that

1

2

basically under the Commerce Clause the appellants have

3

alleged that the mined coal in Montana is destined for out­

4

side the state, that the coal is taxed at 20 to 30 percent of

5

the value.

6

percent, since the production costs, the taxes

7

costs are backed out before the severance tax applies.

8
9

Actually the effective rate of the tax is 22
on

production

And thirdly, they've alleged that the revenues that
are anticipated by Montana in the fiscal years

'78 and '79

10

are $34 million and $40 million respectively for all coal,

11

not just the coal that they're mining, but for all coal that

12

will be mined in Montana in those years.

13

And then they say, therefore, that our tax is not

14

fairly related to the services and. protections provided by the

15

State of Montana, but in their briefs and today in oral argu­

16

ment we hear that Montana's legitimate needs have already

17

been met, and we hear that the local impact

18

appellants' activities only amount to two cents a ton whereas

19

our tax amounts to $2 or more a ton.

20
21

22

costs

from

And we also hear that the tax bears no relationship
to the legitimate needs of the people of the State of Montana.
QUESTION:

Mr. Greely, does Montana follow the pro­

23

cedures of most federal civil rules for the states, all well-

24

of the windfall they would get out of taxing one particular

different from the case that was argued previously, where

there's a difference in the tax on the material taken out of

18

MR. GREELY:

Yes, absolutely.

That sounds -- if

19

that's the factual situation in that case, there could be a

commerce clause discrimination problem which I don't believe

is present here in this case.

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney

General,

under

the Complete Auto case, would a tax be subject to judicial

review of any kind at some point as it got larger and larger

25

and larger?

What if this were twice as large as it is?
20

MR. GREELY:

1

It's understandable that the Complete

2

Auto test and the Commerce Clause test have nothing to do with

3

the rates of the tax, and we have contended, as we did in the

4

lower courts, that we could tax 100 percent, 1,000 percent,

5

not because we want to or that that would be an intelligent

6

thing to do, because obviously there's market limitations and

there's other limitations.

21

MR. GREELY:

1

Well, we're citing Heisler for the

2

proposition that essentially that a severance tax which is a

3

local activity is not a burden on interstate commerce.

4

Obviously, at that time there was a per se rule that has pos­

there was that mining because of the nature of the activity

was not a burden on interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

The United States suggests that Complete

MR. GREELY:

QUESTION:

6

General Greely, let me just take a step

7

further the question the Chief Justice asked you.

Supposing

8

your opponent's assessment is generally correct, that this is

9

an extremely profitable tax in a way for the state and after

10

you win this case, assuming you do, you then reassess your

1 1

budgetary consideration and decide you don’t need any other

12

taxes at all, you repeal all your other taxes and leave your

13

present tax standing in effect.

14

tutional question in your judgment?
MR. GREELY:

15

Would that raise any consti­

I don't know.

I guess it would depend

16

on how that particular tax which, -- I'm assuming that the tax

17

would be constitutional if there were no other taxes.

18

fact that you would repeal all other taxes and just leave

19

one, I don't see how that by itself could be a constitutional

20

question.

I guess I don't know what the challenge to that

21

would be.

Assuming that it's otherwise constitutional --

22

QUESTION:

The

Well, it would be precisely the same

23

challenge here, that under the last prong of the Complete

24

Auto Transit case that there is some integrity, that require­

25

ment of some relationship between the tax and something the
25

1

state does and I don't know exactly what that prong means

2

either, but if it means something --

3

MR. GREELY:

Yes, in answer to your question, I

4

think that even though we can't say maybe exactly what it

5

means, I don't think that it would be a meaningless test.

6

For instance, the Court could have intended by that that the

7

states must impose, if they impose taxes they must allow the

8

taxpayers to avail themselves of the services, and the

9

appellants in this case haven't alleged that they don't --

10

that they're not capable of benefiting from the services that

1 1

Montana provides.

12

somehow be related to the activities of the taxpayer in the

13

state.

14

the tax to the percentage of the value

15

Now, I suppose -- another thing, they suggested that all the

16

states could meet this test, and I suggest to this Court

17

that that's probably true, because I thihk most of the state

18

taxes, certainly those that are a severance tax, would meet

19

this kind of a fairly related test and that unless the

20

were to find, for instance, that Montana taxed the net

21

federal income of the coal companies as opposed to anything

22

that relates to coal, maybe that wouldn't be related to what

23

the. activities were.

24
25

Perhaps the Court meant that the tax must

And I think clearly that's the case when you attach
of the mined coal.

Court

But getting back to our main point, the fact is
that the fairly related test does not require a balancing of
26

1

benefits and burdens of providing certain services for the

2

taxpayers other than the ones that they would generally be

3

entitled to by living in the State of Montana.
QUESTION:

4

Suppose -- hypothetically, again -- it

5

could be shown that the entire cost of the services which

6

the state gave to five taxpayers engaged in extracting natura]

7

resources was $500,000 and that the taxes imposed on them

8

were $100 million.

that other taxes are being reduced, and as the taxes continue

to grow and as this trust fund continues to grow, it already

fund is getting up, $100 million, and as time goes on it will

be in the billions, and Montana won't need any other taxes.

14

This tax already is amounting to almost, it's

approaching 20 percent of the total tax revenues of the state,

so it's only a matter of time that there will be no necessity
