MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2

We'll wait for the noise

3

to subside, counsel.

4

I think you may proceed whenever you are ready, now, Mr. Zell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN ZELL, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. ZELL:

7

8

1 1
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves an issue that was left open in

9

10

We'll wait for a moment or two, here.

Tate v. Short, and that is, may a trial judge revoke the pro­
bation of the probationer or offender if he does not have the
funds to make the monthly payments.
The facts in this case are, I think, rather clear.

13

There are three probationers, of course; three Petitioners
14

in this Court.

Raymond Wood, Edna Allen, and James Tante.

15

They were convicted several years ago of distributing obscene
16

materials.

The records show that Mr. Wood was a clerk in a

17

bookstore -- no dispute about that -- Ms. Allen was a projec­
18

tionist in a theater, and Mr. Tante was the projectionist in
19

that theater.

The fine imposed on Mr. Tante and Ms. Allen

20

was a $5,000.00 fine and 12 months on probation -- that was
21

after the conviction.

They were to pay that fine as directed,

22

which was $500.00 per month, so they would have paid the fine
23

in approximately 10 months.
24

QUESTION:

And that was a condition of the probation

25

3

-

-

1

was it not?

2

MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

3

Mr. Wood was convicted in two counts and he received

4

a $5,000.00 fine in each count, to run consecutively, and 12

5

months on probation.

6

and a $10,000.00 fine, payable again at the rate of $500.00

7

per month over a period of 20 months.

18

Therefore, he had a 24-month sentence

Thereafter I appealed the case to the Georgia Court
of Appeals, and I lost.

I then certioraried the Georgia

Supreme Court and certiorari was denied.

I then certioraried

this Court, and cert was denied with some justices dissenting.
The case came back to the trial court, through remittitur,
that is, and of course while the case was on appeal in Georgia,
as in most states in the federal system, the three Petitioners,
or offenders, defendants, were not on probation.

The convic­

tion, I think, was in March of '77, the remittiturs came back
in October of 1978, and at that point, the three offenders,
the three defendants, started serving their probation, right
at the last week of October.

And the record shows that the

19

probation officers told each one -- there was a different offi­
20

cer for each defendant -- I don't know whether there were
21

three different probation officers -- but anyway, each one
22

said you must pay your fine at the end of next month, at the
23

rate of $500.00 per month.
24

In the record, at page 71, I notified the Court
25
-

-

1

immediately when they were put on probation that they did not

2

have the funds and the fines should be remitted

3

pended or some action taken, because there's going to be a

4

problem in this case on this $20,000.00 in fines.
QUESTION:

5

9

10

1 1

12
13
14

15

16
17

On your theory, then, the Court is power­

less to impose any punishments?
MR. ZELL:

7

8

or sus­

Oh no, the Court is certainly -- has

certain powers to enforce a -- payments on the installment
basis.

Obviously you have your civil penalties certainly,

garnishment, levy on any property.

For example, Mr. Tante

was a prison guard at this time, while he was on probation.
Mr. Wood had a job at a trucking company, I believe, he could
have been garnished.

And Ms. Allen, unfortunately, was on

unemployment compensation and I don't think you can garnish
that, I'm not sure if you can.
QUESTION:

Well doesn't Georgia have some exemptions

to its garnishment statute, for necessary expenses of living?
MR. ZELL:

Yes, there's a certain percentage after

18

-- I think it's, it us'ed to be 50 percent, and it's a little
19

lower, but there's a certain percentage you can only take out
20

for garnishment.

And certainly some small sum of money could

21

have been affected by garnishment at this point.
22

QUESTION:

Well so your complaint is not that a

23

fine was levied on someone who couldn't pay it?
24

MR. ZELL:

Not at all.

25

5

-

-

1

QUESTION:

But that the fine was too high?

2

MR. ZELL:

Correct.

Well that, and commensurate

3

with, first of all, the administration of justice -- what do

4

you do with people who violate the law, and the judge, trial

5

judge, makes a determination that these people can be released

6

on the streets, in society, in public.

7

they shouldn't be incarcerated, they shouldn't be warehoused --

8

so to speak.

9

QUESTION:

10

going to happen:

11

an indigent?

12

They are not a danger,

Mr. Zell, if you prevail here, what's

mandatory imprisonment in every case, of

MR. ZELL:

Well, I'd like to think, in

our

system

13

of justice, that trial judges will not take that position.

14

I'm sure some will.

15

QUESTION:

16
17

And I'd like to think that a trial judge-I'm asking whether your argument might

turn out to be counter-productive?
MR. ZELL:

It could, yes.

I'm aware of -- some

18

trial judges have told me that if they can't lock up an

19

indigent defendant on probation, they're going to get straight

20

time sentences.

21
22
23
24

25

I'm sure that's a possibility.

QUESTION:

My other question is, have these prison

sentences been served?
MR. ZELL:

In this case?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ZELL:

Oh no, they've been -- the judge let th£m

stay out on bond pending this appeal, because they would have

2

served their sentence if they had been incarcerated

3

QUESTION:

So they -- their sentences have been

5

MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

6

QUESTION:

And they have not been served?

7

MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

8

QUESTION:

What were the sentences?

4

9

stayed?

Or, how much jail time will they spend?
MR. ZELL:

10

Mr. Tante received -- and Ms. Allen,

11

received a 12-month sentence each.

12

is a high

13

they get four days --

14

17

and

Under the computation, this

aggravated misdemeanor; they would serve,

QUESTION:

Well, I -- but the sentence was -- they

were put on probation first, weren't they?
MR. ZELL:

Yes. And they served almost three months

of that sentence.

18

QUESTION:

And then --

19

MR. ZELL:

They have nine left.

20

QUESTION:

And was -- the probation was the same

21
22
23
24

25

length as their sentences?
MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

I see.

MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

So they go back and serve their --

-

MR. ZELL:

Nine months less good time, which is

four days a month in this case; which would be 36 days less

nine months, and they'd serve about eight months.

Mr. Wood

Does this record show

from what resources

their bond was provided, if they were indigent and couldn't
pay the fine, the bond cost them some money, I suppose, in
Georgia?
MR. ZELL:

1 1

previous employer.

Yes.

The bond was provided for by their

He put up the bond for them.

12

QUESTION:

What does this record show about their

13

previous employer's practice in paying fines?
14

MR. ZELL:

Well what happened was, and it's in the

15

record, of course, that they were first fined in this case,
16

and then thereafter they were charged again in another case,
17

so that each one was, and a small fine was imposed and paid by
18

their employer.
19

Paid by their employer, through me -- the fine was
20

paid, and they received something like very small suspended
21

sentences.

The fines, I might add, it's on the record, were

22

much smaller than this case, they were $750.00 fines, something
23

like that.

And then when the remittitur came down in the first

24

appeal, they were -- the employer did not pay the fines in
25

1

this case, for certain reasons such as a different change of

2

attitude and a different employer --

3

QUESTION:

Are these Petitioners here in forma

5

MR. ZELL:

Yes, that's correct.

6

QUESTION:

Well doesn't that suggest some validity

4

pauperis ?

7

to Mr. Justice Blackmun's observation, that if the people are

8

before the Court, but not for the first time or the second

9

time, but for the fifth time, and the Court feels that, you

10

know, we don't want to warehouse these people and lock them

1 1

up with murderers, but if we can't do anything else to them --

12

if they are indigent, and small -- or the small time fines

13

haven't deterred them before, isn't there going to be a ten­

14

dency to at least send them to the -- some facility for

15

confinement?
MR. ZELL:

16

Okay, let me just relay a little chron­

17

ology.

18

Now this was their first conviction.

19

stayed working at the theater and bookstore, and they were

20
21

22
23
24

25

The second cases were imposed after this sentence.
They stayed in the --

arrested and pled guilty and received a fine thereafter this
sentence though.

And thereafter, they were before different

judges, and they received a much more modest fine, I think
something under -- less than a thousand dollars.

And it was

paid by their employer because they were working there, they
were useful to the employer to keep working at the theater

-

1

and bookstore.

2

quit.

3

Then when they went on probation they had to

QUESTION:

Well is that really.,a very commendable

4

motive, that the employer pays their fine because they were

5

convicted of doing something that was illegal under Georgia

6

law?
MR. ZELL:

7

Well certainly you can't enforce any

8

agreement between the employer and the employee, it would be

9

against public policy, like enforcing a gambling contract; he

10

promised to pay it, in some instances he did pay the fine.

11

soon as they left work, he didn't pay the fines.
QUESTION:

12

Is this a common provision in Georgia,

13

between employees of so-called adult bookstores and their

14

employers ?

15

MR. ZELL:

As

Yes and no.

It -- many times the

16

employer has paid the fines for employees, many times -- many

17

times he has not.

QUESTION:

And the judge again revoked his

Mr. Zell, do you have pre-sentence reports

in Georgia?
MR. ZELL:

And

That's correct.

1

QUESTION:

Well don't they show how much a man is

3

MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

4

QUESTION:

So the judge knew that he had enough

2

5

worth?

money to pay that fine, didn't he?

6

MR. ZELL:

Well what happened --

7

QUESTION:

Can I assume that?

8

MR. ZELL:

The judge knew -- well here's what

9

happened, Your Honor -- being, as a practical matter, when

10

they were convicted in the first instance, the judge, Judge

1 1

Alexander, was aware of what they were doing; they were making

12

nominal amounts of money as a clerk/projectionist.

13

the judge thought, it's rather obvious from the record, that

14

he thought if he imposed this large fine their employer would

15

pay it.

16

heavy, was so large, your employer will pay it, based on maybe

17

other -- other cases, or at prodding of the prosecutors,

18

saying fine and dandy, don't worry, it will be taken care of.

20

I'm sure that was the thrust of why the fine was so

QUESTION:

19

as a

I'm sure

But the employer was just treating this

cost of doing business, sort of a --

MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

-- licensing fee?

MR. ZELL:

That's correct, sort of licensing, that's

But he is here in forma pauperis, now?

correct.

MR. ZELL:

No.

2

QUESTION:

Oh, the employees.

3

QUESTION:

What would happen if --

4

QUESTION:

But they're not working there anymore?

5

MR. ZELL:

That's right.

6

QUESTION:

What would happen if the pre-sentence

These people are the mere employees--

7

report shows that Mr. Jones has a friend by the name of Mr.

8

Smith and Mr. Smith will give him a thousand dollars, and they

9

fined him a thousand dollars, and they're not working together

10

or anything, this is just a friend; would the Court be entitled

1 1

to go back on that?

12

MR. ZELL:

Well, --

13

QUESTION:

On the fact that he used some bad infor-

MR. ZELL:

Certainly, he should, the Court --

QUESTION:

Well when you get through, I want to know

14

mation?

15
16
17

18
19

again --

the difference between that case and this case.
MR. ZELL:

Well certainly he should -- the judge

20

should modify the condition of probation and the fine -- if

21

there was some misinformation.

22
23
24

25

Obviously, or even a promise

by the defendant -- how many defendants, can afford --QUESTION:

Would you at that time tell the judge

that the man couldn't pay the fine?
MR. ZELL:

No, there was no representation made.

trial was
QUESTION:

You'd just let the judge go down that

MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Now you want to complain about the judge?

Well, I mean that's --

QUESTION:

You're not complaining about yourself

road?
What happened is, --

at all, are you?
MR. ZELL:

9

Well, what happened is, the trial was

10

over.

11

the prosecutor -- and it's not in the record, but I can --

12

prodded the judge to impose a large fine.

13

done in these cases, large fines.

14

their employment and I think the judge, as in many of these

15

The jury returned a verdict of guilty.

18
19

20
21

That normally is.

The judge was aware of

cases, felt that a third party would pay the fine.
There was no -- we do not tell the judge the third

16
17

At that point,

party would pay the fine; we just -- the judge was aware of
the facts.

I did not know if the third party would pay the

fine at that point, there was no guarantee, so to speak, at
that point.

The case was then appealed.

We did not -- they

asked for a large fine, it was just a prodding of the prosecu­
tor, and --

22

QUESTION:

But you didn't represent the third party,

23

you represented this man?
24

MR. ZELL:

At --during the trial in the first

25
-

13

-

1

instance, that's correct.

2

QUESTION:

You still do?

3

MR. ZELL:

Represent the third party?

4

QUESTION:

No.

5

MR. ZELL:

The defendants?

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

7

MR. ZELL:

Yes.

8

QUESTION: You were not a court-appointed counsel?

9

MR. ZELL:

That's correct, I was not.

10

QUESTION:

So he's here as an indigent, in forma

1 1
12

Oh, before this Court, yes, I do.

pauperis, but he has paid counsel, then, I take it?
MR.

ZELL:

No.

The defendants in this case, the

13

way it came about, was, I received a call -- I- wrote the Court

14

a letter, felt obligated to let the Court

15

defendants did not have the money after the appeal was ter­

16

minated, and they were no longer working for the owner of the

17

theater, and I notified the Court that they did not have the

18

funds and to please take some action, that they no longer

19

worked in there and there was going to be some problem, they

20

21
22
23
24

25

know

that the

did not have the money and it would not be forthcoming.
The Court chose not to take any action, this is in
the record, page 71.

And they continued to report on proba­

tion, and that's the last I heard of it.
I then received a call, the first week of January,
saying that they want you down in Court, that I represent
14

-

-

1

these three defendants and would I come down to court to

2

represent them.

3

them, did they have money for counsel and did they want me to

4

represent them, I would be glad to.

5

6

1 1

12

And

so I went down to court to represent them at that point.

8

10

And they said yes, we

want you as our lawyer, you're familiar with our case.

7

9

I contacted the three defendants and I asked

QUESTION:

You received a call from the Court.

MR. ZELL:

Several -- from the defendants, from the

Court, from the solicitor -- concerning the hearing, I received
a

notice

of the hearing date, and of course, the defendants

called me and notified me that they were in some trouble and
what could I do for them.

13
14

QUESTION:

But not from the third party?

MR. ZELL:

No, that's correct; not from a third

QUESTION:

I still want to know, you represent them

party.
15

16

officially here?
17

MR. ZELL:

The defendants.

QUESTION:

And not the third party?

MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

18
19

That's correct.

I have

20

not been paid for this case and that's in the record.

I think

21

the solicitor brought that out

aptly

during

the

22

trial that I had represented the defendants, but I was paid
23

by the theater owner at the time of the trial, when they were
24

working for the theater owner.

But as soon as they were put

25
-

15

-

1

on probation their employment was terminated and therefore

2

the ties were severed with the third party, or the employer.

3

QUESTION:

It's clear, isn't it, Mr. Zell, that

4

the monthly installment

5

probation?

repayments were conditions of the

6

MR. ZELL:

Absolutely.

7

QUESTION:

It was made clear that were these repay­

8

ments not made the probation would be revoked and the custod­

9

ial sentences would be imposed?
MR. ZELL:

10
1 1

imposed, that's correct.
QUESTION:

12
13

16

At that point, the fines were
There

was no --

It was made clear that it was a condition

of the probation?

14

15

Okay.

MR. ZELL:

Absolutely, yes.

It was a condition of

QUESTION:

Well, would it be -- and it's not con­

probation.

17

tended that the prison sentences imposed, which were probated

18

in this case temporarily, were excessive, under the law --

19

20

21
22
23
24

25

they were authorized by statute?
MR. ZELL:

Within the statute, yes.

They were --

that is, the maximum fine is $5,000.00.
QUESTION:

Would it be permissible for a judge to

impose an authorized prison sentence and probate it, depending
say, on the.condition that the defendant, convicted defendant
stand on his head at twelve noon every day?
16

-

-

And then if it

1

turned out that the defendant couldn't -- didn't know how to

2

stand on his head he would go to prison?

3
4

5

MR. ZELL:

I think that' s the reach in this case. It's

just an unreasonable condition.
QUESTION:

Well what, and let's say the judge knew

6

at the time he imposed the probated sentence, that the defen­

7

dant, the convict didn't know how to stand on his head?

8

he could have imposed the prison sentence from the word go,

9

couldn't he have imposed a -- an impossible condition?

10

MR. ZELL:

If

It becomes -- that's correct, it was

11

an illusory

sentence, gives them a.taste of liberty to-

12

see what they could raise, and if you can't raise the money,

13

in prison you go.

14

what I point out in my brief.

15

QUESTION:

It's really an illusory

sentence.

Well, from the point of view of the

16

Defendants, isn't it better than a straight sentence from

17

the beginning?

18

MR. ZELL:

That's

No question about it.

But what do you

19

do when the judge makes a determination and assume he did,

20

that these people should not be put in prison?

21
22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

Well but wasn't part of his determination

the fact that they would be subject to some penalty, i.e.,
the payment of a fine?
MR. ZELL:

Well --

QUESTION:

He didn't intend to let them off

scot-free?

QUESTION:

MR. ZELL:

9

No question about it, that's correct.

10

And all I'm saying before this Court is that when you have

11

the situation, is that other alternatives should be made avail­

12

able to the Court, and for the Defendants, such as community

13

service work, it would be much more constructive.

Not at all; of course not.

on your argument.

That's correct.

5

QUESTION:

And I

I think it doesn't serve any purpose,

Well if these people are in fact, indi­

6

gents as you suggest, putting them to work in community

7

service instead of incarcerating them isn't going to enable

8

them to support their families, is it?

9

MR. ZELL:

Well, what you do Is, and this is just

10

a suggestion, I mean not the only suggestion, is that if

1 1

you give them community service work, perhaps on weekends,

12

at nights -- there are many ways to serve the community,

13

and much more productive for the community for the system,

14

help the society in which they committed the wrong; it's cer­

15

tainly much more noble than to just lock somebody up behind

16

bars for 7 or 8 months because they don't have the money.

17

This case involves, and I'm sure the judge felt,

18

and I conceded, that a third party would pay the money.

19

it has not been forthcoming.

20
21
22
23
24

25

And

That's -- obviously the judge

had that basis.
This is similar in the Hunter v. Dean case, in
which this case granted cert.

It was a -- if you remember,

it was like a 10-year sentence to be placed on probation if
you paid a $2,000.00 fine in advance.

The defendant could not

-- made a representation he could pay the money, he could
20

-

1

not pay it.

2

And he was locked up.

And in Barnett v. Hopper, he granted cert in that

3

case as well and

4

was made, I can pay the money if you'll just give me

5

probation.

6

and the question is, do you lock pepole up where they don't

7

have the money?

8

This involves traffic cases, misdemeanors or felonies.

9

it as moot.

Same representation

And the judge did and he couldn't pay the money,

There should be other alternative means.

QUESTION:

But you don't question, Mr. Zell, as

10

I understand it, that the judge, so far as the Georgia

1 1

statutes went, could have imposed the prison sentence right

12

at the outset -- prison sentences, without any probation

13

whatsoever?

14

15

16
17

MR. ZELL:

That's correct.

He made a determination

they should be on probation at that point, that's correct.
QUESTION:

Well if he made a determination they

should be on probation if they paid $500.00 a month?

18

MR. ZELL:

Oh no, no.

19

QUESTION:

That's a condition of the probation to

20

21

22

Well, is this --

be imposed?
MR. ZELL:

Yes.

They could go on probation, but

they should pay $500.00 a month while they are on probation.

23

QUESTION:

Right.

24

MR. ZELL:

And if they don't pay that $500.00 a

25

month, they are to go to jail.

One of several conditions.

MR. ZELL:

Right, that's -- which is in the appendix,

10

That's right.

11

QUESTION:

Right.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Zell, were there any proceedings

13

against the employer?
MR. ZELL:

14

15

16
17

18
19

20
21

22

In this case, no.

There was none.

They did not proceed against the employer.

Why, I don't

remember why, I'm not sure why. It was merely against the two
employees.

And clearly again, the trial judge relied on the

employer, frankly, I think, to pay the fines.

And now he's

not going to do it, because of change of ownership, I might
add.

He's gone now, and the money is not forthcoming.

And I

don't see how, under Tate v. Short and Williams v. Illinois,
that you could -- this Court, could take the position to say
that a man who doesn't have the funds goes to jail when the man

23

or the defendant who has the funds, able to raise it through
24

employee, employer or a friend, does not go to jail.
25

How do

1

you square this case with Tate case and the Williams case?

2
3

QUESTION:

Yet, you concede that the judge could

have sentenced them ab initio, to twelve months?

4

MR. ZELL:

In the very beginning.

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

6

MR. ZELL:

That's correct, that's correct.

He felt

7

that they were good subjects, fit subjects, to be on probation.

8

That they should not be incarcerated -- he made that deter­

9

mination .

10
1 1
12

QUESTION:

Well but isn't that a typical determina­

tion with a case of non-violent, first or second offenders?
MR. ZELL:

Generally speaking, Iwould say so, yes.

13

The -- I might add that the American Bar Association of

14

Standards relating to sentencing suggests -- I mean, the

15

judge imposes a sentence, -- that he look at the profitability

16

in the crime, non-violent crime, but it also suggests, American

17

18
19

20
21

Bar Association, that they not revoke the man's probation if he
doesn't have the ability to pay the fine.

And in all law review

articles I've read, and all the cases I could find, there's not
one case except in Georgia as far as I know in Shepherdizing
Tate and Williams, where a court has said if you don't have
the money on the installment basis, you go to jail.

Well, I think then the Court, such as in

a -- I'm using an analogy as in a divorce rule, in a man
supporting his family.

If he squanders away money that he

didn't give to his family, he could be held in contempt of
Court.

And I think this would be similar.

If he squandered,

the money away or had a good job that he turned down, to make
a lot of money, willfully didn't work, I think then the Court
can use that as a criteria to revoke him, put him in jail.
Because he's not trying under the probation, under his pro­
bation, to pay the fine.

QUESTION:

And if he knew that you couldn't --

10

MR. ZELL:

Collect the fine?

11

QUESTION: -- collect the fine or put him in jail,

12

he -- he probably would sentence him to jail in the first

13

place.

14

MR. ZELL:

Well, I'm going to take it from a theor­

15

etical point of view, if I may.

16

judges will make a determination -- and I think they are duty-

17

bound to do this -- whether a man should go to jail or not,

18

regardless of money, regardless of other criteria, where in the

19

first instance should he put him out on the street, serve his

20

21
22
23
24

25

sentence in society, first.

I'd like to think that trial

If he makes that determination as

he did in this case, he then decides what other penalties
to impose upon the Defendant, such as a fine, community service
weekends in jail, what other -- myriad amount of things he
could use to so to speak punish the man.

Well, not punish him,

but make him helpful to the community. Primarily I'd consider
-

27

-

1

2

community, service work would be the best thing to do with
people who don't have funds.

That helps himself, he pays a

3

penalty, he loses his recreational time on weekends and at

4

nights, and he also helps the community by doing some charitable

5

work.

6

we saying the government doesn't have the money to run

itself?

8

we furthering by saying you pay this money, it's important

9

in the system of criminal justice.

It isn't important; it's

10

very unimportant to collect money.

And the judges, trial

1 1

judges should realize this and I think most of them do, frankly.

12

And to use money as a criteria to put a man in jail among

robbery?

MR. ZELL:

I'm. .sure many defendants have said that to

14

the trial judge; I certainly wouldn't advise this Court that

15

I was represented to say that.

16

the judge makes a determination that he could be on the

17

street, that he could be on probation, and he has a suspended

18

sentence; don't lock him up later for not having wealth, not

19

having material goods.

20

QUESTION:

All we're saying is that after

Mr. Zell, I don't want to repeat myself,

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN W. DUNSMORE, JR.,

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

3
4

5

MR. DUNSMORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether a judge can condi­

6

tion probation on the payment of a fine, revoke that period of

7

probation for non-payment of the fine, particularly when the

8

individual has represented to the Court that they had the funds

9

or the means by which to pay the fine.

10

Underlying that consideration is whether the sen­

1 1

tencing judge could properly consider third-party sources as

12

assisting the individual in the payment of the fine.

13

Now this case does not involve, as some cases pre­

14

viously to the Court have provided, extending the period of

15

confinement greater than allowed by statute.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, suppose a man has

17

got the money and he is sentenced to pay $5,000 a month, which

18

is no problem to him.

But he starts serving the sentence at

19

the end of the year

1929 and he is

everybody else.

Yes, he can always go through it

23

in Georgia, at any time, the Courts -- we pointed that out in

25

modify a sentence or to release the individual from the

5

conditions of his probation at that time.

Normal procedure

as to what percentage of the cases, I could not indicate to
you, but that is a means available to a defendant.
QUESTION:

You go to the sentencing judge?

MR. DUNSMORE:

You go to the sentencing judge because

6

he retains jurisdiction over that case, during that time that

7

the individual is on a period of probation.

8
9

Now, I think it's important in this case that the
individuals, at this time, are not in confinement.

And I was

10

under the misapprehension, and I'll correct that, on page 9

1 1

of my brief, and I indicated that confinement resulted -- it

12

did not, as Mr. Zell said, initially.

13

factor is that these individuals are out on bond, on an appeal

14

bond, that bond was posted on February 13, 1979, which was

15

the date when the judge said that after the hearing in January,

16

of '79, if you don't pay the arrears, I'm going to give you

17

two weeks to pay the arrearage for approximately $1500, then

18

I'm going to revoke probation.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. DUNSMORE:

I think the important

What was the amount of that bond?
Now the bond for Mr. Wood is $20,000,

21

and under the Georgia statutory scheme, the maximum amount

22

-- or, the amount that would have to be paid for that bond,

23

according to my figures, would be $1,025.

Mr. Tante; it was a $10,000 bond and I think my math worked
out to something like $525.

QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record to

indicate where this indigent got the money to pay that?

MR. DUNSMORE:

No, and I think that gets into --

Well if it's not in the record, I don't waht

you to pursue it. I just wanted to know if it was in the record

10

MR. DUNSMORE:

I think the interesting part of the

1 1

case, though, which the Court can consider, is in our Appendix

12

A, which is the revocation proceeding in January of .1979, Mr.

13

Zell told the sentencing judge, the trial judge, Judge Alexande

14

that these individuals' previous fines in connection with

15

other cases, had been paid and that he had paid them.

16

I think —

18

MR. DUNSMORE:

19

QUESTION:

20

Now, --

You said previous fines?
That is correct.

Perhaps I misundertsood Mr. Zell, but

I thought that this was their first conviction.
All right.

If I can, the scenario

22

is, this is their first conviction.

This is what happened:

23

each one of them was arrested and they pursued their .consti­

24

tutional right to submit the matter before a jury; a jury in

MR. DUNSMORE:

March of 1977 found them guilty as charged and the judge at

that time, said I'm going to put your sentence at 12 months,
the maximum for these convictions of distributing obscene
materials, since it's considered an aggravating -- a misdemeanor
of a high and 'aggravating nature, is 12 months and a $5,000 fine
or both.

6

Now, after that time, they appealed to the Court of

7

Appeals, then to the Supreme Court of Georgia, then a writ of

8

certiorari.

23, 1978 order when the judge says all right, I'm going to --

In the interim, between the time of the October

10

the terms and conditions of probation start on this date.

11

They entered pleas of guilty to subsequent offenses.

12

those subsequent offenses which are referred to in our

Appendix A on the brief in opposition to writ of certiorari,

14

where Mr. Zell tells the judge yes, I paid the fine, or

15

the employers gave me the money to pay these fines -QUESTION:

16

It was

17

the then-pending probation because of that conviction of a

subsequent crime?

Yes, he could have, I believe -- well,

I believe he could have.

of the case, is that he had --

counsel at one of these hearings that the employer had paid
the bonds --

1

4

MR. DUNSMORE:

Oh Mr. Chief Justice Burger, yes,

that's in regard to -- well, two things.

I believe the Peti­

tioners all said, and this is important, I think, they said
that when we were employed, our employers told us that if

5

at any time during our employment you're arrested or anything

6

we will pay your fines, we will make sure that bond is

7

arranged and we will provide you with legal representation.

8

Now in the appendix, there is indication that the King Bonding

9

Company paid the bonds for these individuals when they were

10

arrested -- and, I would assume, the continuing appeal bonds

11

until October 23rd, 1978.

12

14

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, if that's true,

why wasn't the owner arrested?
MR. DUNSMORE:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I have no idea,

and I cannot speak for the solicitor of Fulton County.

16

QUESTION:

I understand.

17

MR. DUNSMORE:

Now these individuals also indicated

18

-- and I think the representation is, too, properly to the

19

Court, that here, the employer has -- the employer even told

20

one of them, I believe it was Mr. Tante, there was an indi­

21

cation in the probation revocation hearing, well how did you

22

know to get Mr. Zell?

23

that he had represented them previously.

24

also testimony in that revocation hearing that the -- it had

25

been suggested by the employer to contact Mr. Zell.

I believe there is testimony in there

also an indication in the record that Mister -- an inference,
anyway, because I don't think it comes out clearly -- an infer­

ence that the employer paid Mr. Zell's fee.

4

we need to --

5

QUESTION:

Now, I think

Mr. Dunsmore, let me ask you one question

6

about the appendix on page 21, and it's in the last paragraph

7

there where that court states, and this is the trial court,

8

order of probation, "It is further ordered that the Court, and

9

the Defendant is hereby advised that the Court may at any time

10

revoke or modify any conditions of this probation or change

11

the period of probation, and may discharge the Defendant from

12

probation."

13

the Defendant from probation?

14

Was any application made in this case to discharge

MR. DUNSMORE:

None on the record, now.

And I say

15

that with -- well for the qualified remark, that on page 71,

16

of the probation revocation hearing, there is an indication

17

from Mr. Zell that I wrote the court.

18

pointed out in our brief in this case, at the time the sen­

19

tences were imposed, the Defendants -- Petitioners in this

20

case -- sat back in silence.

21

tion officers at that time and said, you know, we can't pay.

22

There's an indication that the probation officer said we'll

23

accept partial payments, and they never went in and told the

24

-- indicated to their probation supervisors that you know, we

25

could pay a lesser amount.

But I think as we

They never went in to the proba­

They refused, and I use the word
38

-

-

1

refused, to pay the fine because they were under the impres­
2

sion, and I think rightly so, from -- on the conditions of
3

employment -- that their employers would pay the fine.

And

4

therefore they took no action.
5

Now, I think what that amounts to in this case, re­
6

gardless of funds, is are we not
7

8
9

10
11

12
13
14

deceiving a trial judge?

And as Mr. Justice Marshall says, let the judge go down the
road, -- you know, many times you say well can silence be
a condoning aspect?

I think it can, in this situation.

I

think we're talking about the integrity of the sentencing
function of the criminal justice system.

To allow criminal

defendants to mislead a judge or, that is, to not bring to
his attention facts that are different, let the judge rely
on it, get the benefit of a lesser sentence, and then come

15

back in and say, gee I'm sorry, we just didn't have any

16

money.

17

-- 19 months intervening from March of 1977 to October of

18

1978 when they were actually put under probation supervisors.

19

In that period of time they had an opportunity to check with

20

their employer, and say, are you going to pay the fine, the

21

record is silent, they did nothing.

Particularly when you had one year and seven months

22

They never, at any time, went and tried to pay

23

the fine.

24

they could borrow any money, to my understanding.

25

them were earning some sort of money and and the word indigent,

There's no showing that they went out to see if

4

QUESTION: Did they ever ask the Court to reduce

5

the amount of the installments and put them over a longer

6

period of time?

7

MR. DUNSMORE:

No, there was no effort made at any

8

time to reduce the installments or to seek anything else.

9

a matter of fact, on page 69 of the Appendix -- Appendix A,

As

10

which is not the brown appendix, but the one appended to our

1 1

brief in opposition -- the judge, Judge Alexander, says I

12

didn't ask the question because I thought I could enforce the

13

agreement.

14

judge was under the impression that the third parties would

15

pay this fine.

Now why should the judge be able to look to

16

third parties?

In the probation context, just as if we're

17

putting the individual out on parole, we're trying to find

18

an alternative to confinement.

Right there, there's evidence right there that the

Now an alternative to confinement has the purpose

of rehabilitation.

Now that same factor must be viewed in the eyes of the

of violating the law.

That is, illegal to the extent that

10

MR. DUNSMORE:

Well let me

explain that, Mr. Justice

1 1

Marshall.

12

we're reading too much into it, because that assumes that the

13

solicitor knew that the employer was going to pay the fine.

14

15

QUESTION:

MR. DUNSMORE:

I don't believe that the solicitor

stated it in open court.

18
19

MR. DUNSMORE:

MR. DUNSMORE:

MR. DUNSMORE:

-- was there, wasn't he?
That's correct.

So he heard it, didn't he?
-

42

-

1

MR. DUNSMORE:

Right.

But I think the key, Mr.

2

Justice Marshall and the Court, is that when an employer in

3

this situation says that he will vouch for this individual --

4

particularly rehabilitative efforts -- is he not telling the

5

Court that he is going to see to it that his conduct conforms

6

to the law?

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. DUNSMORE:

QUESTION:

10

MR. DUNSMORE:

his conduct to the law?
QUESTION:

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

And you think the Court would go along

with that?
MR. DUNSMORE:

Well I don't know, but I think it's

a reasonable basis, a rational basis for the Court to consider;
that if somebody's going to pay some money out for them, are
they going to continue to hire this individual and why would
they pay the fines if they thought that the conduct -- to
continue, would they continue to violate the law?
43

-

-

You know,

1

Mr. Zell says that to continue to work there would mean that
2

they would violate the terms of their probation; that assumes
3

that the conduct that the employer in this case has vouched for
4

is going to continue.

And .1 don't think you can make that

5

assumption.
6

QUESTION:
7

8
9

10
1 1

12

13
14

15

Mr. Dunsmore, I'm not sure I understood

why you think all of this is relevant.

As the case comes to

us, it's been determined by your Court of Appeals that it was
established at the revocation hearing that these defendants
were not able to pay these fines.

That's what the -- that's

what the Court of Appeals said, it said at the revocation
hearings it was established that none of the Appellants had
the financial resources to make the payments.

And the Court

held, nevertheless, that that makes no difference, that you
may incarcerate these defendants for failure to pay for the

16

balance of their sentences, in one case the remainder of a two-

17

year sentence.

18

Now, isn't that the issue as it comes here?

19

MR. DUNSMORE:

20
21

That is correct and the Court of

Appeals just said -QUESTION:

Well what difference does it make about

third parties, or what the agreement was or what the antici­
pation of the judge was?
MR. DUNSMORE:
QUESTION:

Well because

--

Because the Court of Appeals took it on
-

44

-

1

2
3
4

5

the assumption it could not -- that it had been determined
that they were financially unable to pay.
HR. DUNSMORE:
QUESTION:

Well the Court of Appeals --

Why don't you just defend that -- which

you do, I'm sure, you defend that -- that even if they couldn't

6

pay, and were unable to pay, it was quite constitutional to

7

put them in jail?

8

MR. DUNSMORE:

9

QUESTION:

10

Right.

And --

Isn't that your position?

MR. DUNSMORE:

That's correct.

And one of the

1 1

things, we're not -- there's no vindictiveness, we're not

12

increasing the sentence at all.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DUNSMORE:

The sentence was --

No, I ---you know, 12 months, $5000 fine.

15

He could, and as Mr. Justice Rehnquist said and you said

16

earlier, he could have slap, right off the board, said, you

17

know, in you go and $5,000 fine.

18

QUESTION:

And what if the sentencing judge had

19

known at the time he imposed the -- as a condition of probation

20

-- that the convicted defendants

21

if he'd known at that very moment that there was no possibility

22

at all that the defendants could repay?

23

MR. DUNSMORE:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. DUNSMORE:

$500 a month, what

Well that question is --

Isn't that just the equivalent --- a little more, that's a little

45

assumes--and would

put us in a more difficult position, because there, there's
an indication of vindictiveness.

And as Mr. Zell said, an

illusory.

5

6

that

But there's no evidence of any vindictiveness at
all in this case.

7

I think that is an essential matter.

QUESTION:

What if

he had been morally certain

8

that the defendants couldn't meet one or more of the other

9

conditions of probation?

10

MR. DUNSMORE:

Well I agree, I think it makes it

1 1

far more difficult, because they are -- impuning bad faith

12

to the judge and I don't think, on the record here, there's

13

anything to impune lack of judicial integrity on the part of

14

the sentencing judge.

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General Dunsmore, I got

18

the impression from your adversary that the problem presented

19

by this case is somewhat unique to Georgia.

20

same impression?

21

Do you have that

And if so, --

MR. DUNSMORE:

Well I'm not too sure of -- when he

22

said unique to Georgia -- I take it, in terms of the fact that

23

judges don't place individuals on, let's say, spend five nights

24

in the county jail or work for a health facility.

So, I don't think it's unique to -QUESTION:

But his suggestion seems supported by

the fact we've had two previous cases from Georgia where
parole was revoked because of inability to pay a fine.

I

10

just don't know whether it arises in other jurisdictions or

1 1

not the same way.

12

MR. DUNSMORE:

13

couldn't tell you that.

14

know, that it's unique, because I do know from some limited

15

experience outside, that you know, other alternatives, depend­

16

ing on who the judge is.

17

what I believe we need to get back to is:, the sentencing dis­

18

cretion of the judge and the fact that other alternatives are

19

available or he could consider other alternatives, is it

20

unconstitutional to consider financial resources, and is it

21

unconstitutional to enforce the terms of the sentence which

22

is prescribed by law?

23

with, and we say it's not.

Mr. Justice Stevens, I couldn't -But I don't think that it -- you

the path.

3

that somewhat disturbing and irreprehensible that somebody

4

sits down and misinterprets or misleads the Court, particularly

5

in the context that we're brought up

of the Court -- I think most criminal defendants and most

individuals, when they are faced in a court situation, tend

to be honest.
