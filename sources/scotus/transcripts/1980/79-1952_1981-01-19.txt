ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR.

ZIMMERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

This case arises under the Federal Election Campaign

11

Act.

12

sion by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals which sustained the

13

validity of the $5,000 calendar year limitation on contribu­

14

tions to a political committee.

15

of the unique judicial review provisions contained in

16

2 U.S.C. 437h,

construe the constitutionality of the Act and for the certi­

18

fication of those actions to the court of aDpeals with ulti­

19

mate review on appeal in this Court.

Appellants claim that the $5,000 limit

1

organizations to contribute unlimited amounts of administra­

2

tive support to their political committees violates the

3

equal protection rights of appellants.

4

The term "administrative support" as used by the

5

parties and the court below refers to anything of value used

6

for the purpose of establishing, administering, or soliciting

7

contributions to a political committee.

8
9

Appellant California Medical Association is an
unincorporated membership organization.

Its membership con­

10

sists of approximately 25,000 physicians who practice in

1 1

California.

12

known as the California Medical Political Action Committee.

13

CALPAC receives in kind administrative support from CMA.

14

CALPAC also receives contributions from physicians who choose

15

to contribute to it. CALPAC supports candidates who run for

16

federal office, among other things.

17

The CMA sponsors a political action committee

Appellants Foster and Rose are members of both CMA

18

and CALPAC.

Dr. Foster is the treasurer of CALPAC; Dr. Rose

19

is a past president of CMA and has been an officer in CALPAC.

QUESTION:

21

with the Court of Appeals for

22

jurisdiction in this case?

23
24
25

Mr. Zimmerman, I gather you disagree

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

the 9th Circuit as to our

Well, this Court does have jurisdic­

tion, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Do you agree or disagree with the Court

of Appeals' treatment of the jurisdiction -- ?

2
3

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

They found that they had jurisdiction to hear the case.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

6

Well, I agree with it, Your Honor.

Under what section?
Well, the -- the majority, at any

event, Your Honor, didn't hear the --

7

QUESTION: Well, that's what I mean.

8

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

9

Right.

They initially of course,

I think, convened pursuant to 437h.

However, the majority

10

based its decision to hear the case, en banc, at least, not

11

on Section 437h but on Rule 35; but that only deals with the

12

aspect of an en banc panel or a three-judge panel, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

But this was an inter -- if it were an

14

ordinary case and not an FEC case, clearly the questions

15

certified by Judge Orrick were interlocutory, and the Court

16

of Appeals wouldn't be justified in simply resting its juris­

17

diction on the en banc statute.

18

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Well, Your Honor, this isn't an

19

interlocutory appeal.

under the Act.

It isn't the certification under those

It's a special statute which permits the

It's a unique provision.

QUESTION:

Yes, but the majority didn't rest on that

provision?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Yes, I think they did, Your Honor.
5

1

As I read the decision, they didn't sit en banc pursuant to

2

437h.

They sat en banc pursuant to Rule 35.
QUESTION:

3

Yes, but doesn't the special jurisdic­

4

tional provision require them to sit en banc, not pursuant to

5

Rule 35?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

6

I don't think it makes any differ­

7

ence, Your Honor.

It's exactly what the Court did in Buckley

v. Valeo.

that the 5th Circuit did the same thing in a case which has

1 1

been cited in the briefs, FEC v. Lance.

12

three-judge panel certified constitutional questions to the

13

en banc panel.

14

this through counsel from the Commission, but I understand

15

that they chose to sit pursuant to Rule 35 and hear the case

16

en banc.

17

In that case the

That case was just decided, and I only get

I don't think it makes any difference, Your Honor.
The important aspect with respect to this Court's

18

jurisdiction under 437h(b) is not whether the court below sat

19

en banc pursuant to 437h(a) or sat en banc pursuant to Rule

20

35, but rather whether there was a question properly certifiec

21

to the circuit court, and whether there's been a decision on

22

that matter.

23

Now, that's what Section 437h(b) states.

QUESTION:

What the Court of Appeals said

in their

24

opinion on the top of page A-3 was, "We hear the appeal en

25

banc pursuant to

Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure,
6v

1

No.

35." and that jurisdiction is conferred by,, among others,

2

437h, confirming what you have just told my brother Rehnquist.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

3
4

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

5

6

Yes, that's my understanding,

Well, why would they purport to sit under1

the Rule rather than under the statute?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

7

Oh, very simple, Your Honor.

When

8

the case was certified to the court, Judge Browning, the

9

presiding judge, issued an order asking the parties to ad­

10

dress the constitutionality of the requirement that the court

11

sit en banc.

12

issue of the requirement the court impanel itself en banc.

His question to counsel was directed at the

13

QUESTION:

I see, okay.

14

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

All right.

And at oral argument there was

15

considerable debate about whether Congress had the power to

16

do that.
QUESTION:

17
18
19

Is that why the other courts are doing

it too?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Well, I suspect they're doing it

20

because the 9th Circuit, for the reason the 9th Circuit indi­

21

cated that they wanted to avoid that question.

22

QUESTION:

You mean, whether or not Congress con­

stitutionally could require them to sit en banc?

Yes, that's it, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, did they successfully avoid it?

10

Well, that's right, Your Honor.

Anyway, they avoided it -They did, Your Honor.

Look at page A-26 of the Jurisdictional Statement,

the para­

graph at the bottom of the page:

11

"Delicate questions such as those here suggested

12

are to be decided only when necessary.

13

better course is to let our decision to hear the case

14

en banc rest on our authority under Federal Rules of

15

Appellate Procedure 35."

16

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

We think the

I read that, Your Honor, as meaning

17

to sit en banc, not to hear the case, to hear the case en

18

19

which they addressed to counsel, was why do we have to get

together en banc?

judges; 11 of them were actually impanelled and only nine par­

22

ticipated in the decision.

24

That was the concern that Judge Browning had when he asked us

25

to address that question.

The question that the court was confronted with, and

At that time the 9th Circuit had 13 active

It's a real problem in getting a panel that large.

But I think the court took its cue from Buckley v.
That's exactly what the D.C. Circuit did on that case.

you see any reason why Congress

can't tell any court of appeals in the country that they must

sion of a social security hearing officer must be heard by

13

an en banc panel of the appropriate court of appeals, well,

14

obviously, the courts would be inundated with litigation.

That would be an impossibility.

Now, I can understand if at some

QUESTION:

17

would it be unconstitutional?

18

Well, it might be inconvenient, but

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Only if it involved a problem with

19

the separation of powers, which a massive volume of litigation

20

might.

21

I don't think so.
QUESTION:

Well, no one has ever suggested, as I

22

recall it, that Congress's requirement that district judges

23

sit in panels of three in certain cases had any constitu­

24

tional infirmity.

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

No, I don't think there is any

is was avoided.

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

Have you read the Western Pacific case?

QUESTION:

11

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

12

That's right, Your Honor.

Not recently, Your Honor.

Have you ever read it?
I may have, Your Honor, in prepara­

tion for the hearing before the 9th Circuit.
Now, in further addressing the jurisdictional ques­

13
14

tion, I think it's helpful to take a look at the procedural

15

history of the case.

16

1979.

17

October of 1978, the Commission found reason to believe that

18

violations of the $5,000 limit had occurred, because CMA's

19

in kind support of CALPAC exceeded $5,000 during the years

20

1976 through 1978.

21

This case was actually filed on May 7,

However, it's important to note that earlier on, in

QUESTION:

Under this Act, what is the limit that

22

each doctor involved in this enterprise may contribute to a

23

political committee?

24

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

25

QUESTION:

$5,000, Your Honor.

Each one may contribute $5,000?
10

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

1

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

2

general limit on contributions to a political committee as

3

contained in this section, 441a(a)(1)(C) is $5,000.

4

ry, there is a parallel provision which states the same

5

amount.

6

to another committee; all other persons may contribute $5,000

7

to a political committee.

9

A multicandidate committee may contribute $5,000

QUESTION:

8

Is there any limitation on the number of

political committees that the $5,000 could be given to?

10

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

1 1

There is one possible -QUESTION:

12

13

I'm sor­

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

So you could have 50 and still make

QUESTION:

Does every single dispute between the

Federal Elections Commission and a potential contributor

discussing?

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

No, not at all, Your Honor.

These provisions only involve the constitutionality of pro­

Do you think, if Congress passed an

amendment to this statute next year, you would be entitled to

22

the same rapid-fire consideration as you got in this case?

23

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Well, Your Honor, as long as the

24

requirements of Article III have been satisfied, yes. When you

25

have to have a case or controversy, you have to have a party
12

1

that's got standing to bring that litigation.

QUESTION:

3

MR.

I agree with that; surely.

ZIMMERMAN:

But if the requirements of Article

13

ever, we really are only interested in that prohibition to the;

assumption that the limit that's placed on contributions to

19

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Well, Your Honor, I think that some

20

of the arguments which would go to invalidate the limit with

21

respect to administrative support also apply to the statute

22

across the board.

23

that has been --

QUESTION:

But in Mr. Justice White's example, the

17

size of the check might have something to do with it.

18

for $50 million, simply because it was labeled for adminis­

19

trative support, would not be necessarily for administrative

20

support if the showing were that all the administrative

21

expenses, however liberally construed, amounted to no more

22

than $50,000.

23

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

A checl:

Yes, that's true, Your Honor, but

24

then it depends on what happens to the balance of that check

25

and how it's used.

But the basic nature of administrative
16

1

support is: not corruptive.

This wherewithal is provided for

2

the committee to function.

It allows the members of the

3

Political Action Committee to engage in political action, and

4

there is no inherent corruptive potential in administrative

5

support.
QUESTION:

6
7

To the extent that it used for adminis­

trative purposes, it isn't going to some candidate?

8

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

That's correct, Your Honor.

So there's no connection between the

donor and the candidate, is that correct?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

1 1

That's right, Your Honor.

There are:

12

two different relationships.

13

donor to committee.

14

committee to candidate, or contributor to candidate.

15

the nexus which requires regulation.

16

which the Court sustained in the Buckley decision, to prevent

17

quid pro quos.

The second is the relationship of
That's

That's the regulation

This is one step removed —

QUESTION:

18

One is the relationship of

Why is there any difference in terms of

19

corruptive influence between giving a candidate $200,000 in

20

cash and giving him an airplane and a band to go around with

21

him, and pay all his phone bills and do all his canvassing,

22

spend $200,000 that way?

23

the other?

24
25

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Why is one more corruptive than

Well, Your Honor, again, it's not

something given to a candidate at all.
17

These are donations

QUESTION:

1

Well, but if you’re talking about it,

2

would you say then that the distinction between cash and

3

administrative support would not be a valid distinction if

4

the donations went right to a candidate as opposed to a

5

committee?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

6

That's correct, Your Honor.

If

7

the nexus is donor-candidate, then there's a need for limits

8

and regulations.

If you say that to a candidate, that's quite another matter,

but if you say to a political committee, we will provide for

your administrative expenses, that will allow you to use

17

those voluntary contributions received from various donors

18

in order to make contributions to candidates.

19

there is, it enhances the committee's ability to make contri­

because the voluntary contributions the committee receives

12

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

When someone subsidizes the adminis­

trative expenses, it enhances the committee's ability to

14

engage in protected

speech and associational activities.

15

Now, in the Buckley case, the court of course found

16

the contribution limits valid but invalidated the expenditure

quid pro quo relationships between the person making the

committees, not just in-kind support, not just administrative

points out that if support for a political committee is given

corruption and the prevention of the appearance of corruption.

QUESTION:

Well, would you agree with with the

20

underlying theory of the Buckley decision, or would you agree

that the underlying theory is that money is speech?

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

So, presumably, the Corrupt Practices

Getting back to the less drastic means available,

22

just for a moment here, the Act contains comprehensive regis­

23

tration requirements, comprehensive reporting requirements.

24

There are limits on contributions by individuals, $1,000 per

25

candidate per election.

There is a $5,000 limit on
23

1

contributions by multicandidate committees to candidates.

2

And in addition there's a $25,000 limit on aggregate contri­

that there's a comprehensive regulatory scheme already in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES NEVETT STEELE, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

5

6

Mr. Steele.

MR. STEELE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

7

There are two matters here, the jurisdictional

8

matter and the substantive regulation.

9

use the majority of my time to deal with the substantive regu­

While I will try and

10

lation, I would like to spend a few minutes on the jurisdic­

11

tional question, because it is something that I think has

12

caused great difficulty to the courts of appeals below.

13

The question is really one, I think, of statutory

14

interpretation, of the proper interpretation of 2 U.S.C.

15

437h.

16

as we have urged on other circuits, that that statute should

17

be narrowly construed, that the words in that statute "as may

18

be appropriate to construe the constitutionality of the Act,"

19

do not mean that any question certified up to the court must

20

be dealt with with the very extraordinary provisions that

21

437h provides, not only of en banc hearings in front of the

22

court of appeals, but then

23

to this Court, in an era, of course, when there has been at

24

least in other instances some indication of trying to limit

25

that kind of direct appeal.

We urged upon the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit,

a

25

direct

right

df

appeal1

So, we have urged that there should be a narrow

1

2

interpretation of that phrase, "as may be appropriate," and

3

that in circumstances such as this case here, where there

4

was already a proceeding which had commenced in front of the

5

Commission, that it was not appropriate for the Court of

6

Appeals to hear that case.
The Court of Appeals took what seems to have been a

7

8

middle course.

They asked, as noted in the record, that the

9

parties address the question of the constitutionality of the

10

requirement that they sit en banc, and then at least in our

1 1

opinion, did not sit pursuant to 437h because they specificallj

12

said that they would not follow the requirement set forth in

13

the statute by Congress that they be required to sit en banc.

14

There is -- 1 do not want to go through the various

15

cases that have dealt with 437h, because they have been set

16

forth at length in our brief and in our opponents' brief.

17

I would like to call attention to the case that was just re­

18

cently decided last week, on January 15, in FEC v. Lance,

19

which is cited at page 15 of our brief, Note 21.

20

There in a subpoena -- that was a case in which the

21

Commission had brought an enforcement of its subpoena action.

22

The subpoena was enforced early in 1978, the Court of Appeals

23

stayed that action, and stayed that action pending hearing on

24

the defenses that had been raised, including constitutional

25

defenses.

A panel decision was rendering, saying that the
26

1

subpoena should be enforced, that it did not find the defen­

2

ses acceptable, but that due to the presence of 437h they

3

felt that the constitutional defenses raised to the subpoena

4

should be certified to the en banc Court of Appeals.
The en banc Court of Appeals in the decision that

5

6

was rendered last week, following the 9th Circuit, indicated

7

that it felt that due to the same kinds of considerations tha1

8

had bothered the 9th Circuit, that it should hear that case

9

pursuant to Rule 35.
QUESTION:

10
11

And did the panel members sit on the

en banc?

12

MR. STEELE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. STEELE:

Yes, they did.
Under 35?
Of the panel members, there was some

15

disagreement as to the requirement, but the court as a whole

16

in a vote that was 20 to 4 felt that they should sit pursuant

17

to Rule 35.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

And would you suggest, whether, had there

been 437, that they would have sat at all?
MR. STEELE:

Well, the suggestion is that they felt

21

that they did not have to sit pursuant to 437h; since the

22

case had only come to them that way from the panel, I

23

think that there was any indication that they would have

24

judged it by the standards of Rule 35.

25

don't

Again, with regard to the underlying constitutional
27

1

question that I think that the courts of appeals have now --

2

three of them, including the Court of Appeals for the District

3

of Columbia

4

set forth in the dissenting opinion in the court below, that

5

at some juncture a command to the courts to sit en banc be­

6

comes an interference with the internal proceedings.

7

here, I think the considerations, the fears, are

In response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question,

8

my understanding of the Western Pacific case was that absent

9

a statutory provision that the courts of appeals were free to

10

set rules for the hearings of their cases en banc,

1 1

seem here that that case would not govern, in the sense that

12

there is a specific statutory provision.

13

QUESTION:

it would

But Western Pacific also held that there

14

had to be some proceeding for a hearing.

15

just wasn't any hearing en banc in the 9th Circuit.

16

your three-judge opinion and you would file a paper with the

17

clerk asking for a petition for rehearing en banc and you

18

never heard anything more about it.

19

the court was free to establish any reasonable proceedings,

20

as I understand it, for granting or denying a petition for re­

21

hearing en banc, but there had to be some proceeding whereby

22

the petition was at least considered.

23

MR. STEELE:

In those days there
You had

And this Court held that

I think that's correct, resolving the

24

conflict with the 3rd Circuit, which had held that it had had

25

that power in the Textile Mills case, and I think Western

1

Pacific follows that.

2

here where Congress has explicitly put forward the en banc

3

requirement.

4

seem to be a serious question, one that does seem to have

5

constitutional dimensions, at least in the thought of many of

6

the judges in the courts below, and certainly one that would

7

lend support in our mind that either to avoid that question

8

or to avoid that kind of use of resources, that this Court

9

should narrowly construe 437h as a whole

I don't think it reaches the question

It is our contention, however, that that does

not to reach such

10

cases as ones like this where the Commission after an investi­

1 1

gation and a notification to parties where they are allowed

12

to raise defenses, where there were not only the matters that

13

are at issue here, but were matters of excessive contribu­

14

tions to particular candidates raised, of failure to register

15

affiliation, that when proceedings like that have started,

16

or in the Lance case where, in effect, the Commission under

17

a command to investigate things expeditiously is trying to

18

obtain enforcement of a subpoena; that to read 437h to require

19

the courts of appeals to sit, listen and try and decide in

20

the most abstract kind of setting all constitutional questions

21

that might be raised is certainly not a good use of judicial

22

resources and one that would not seem to be mandated by the

23

words of the statute, which, as I say, seem to leave discre­

24

tion in the courts of appeals, the language, "as may be

25

appropriate."

29

1

QUESTION:

Although every -- as I understand it,

2

at least, every court of appeals has accepted the basic

3

appealability provisions of 437h, and what they've done is

4

duck the en banc requirement of 437h.

5

MR.

STEELE:

I think that's correct.

They have

dealt with it in various different ways.

MR.

Is that correct?

Right.

STEELE:

For instance, in the 2nd Circuit,

in the CLITRIM case, they there took their case oh the 437h

certification but turned around and said, but the only way

11

we can see to deal with these issues that are being raised

But in this case, the Court of Appeals

23

for the 9th Circuit, while it avoided what it thought to be

24

an issue,a serious issue as to the constitutionality of the

25

en banc requirement, nonetheless accepted the merits of the

30

1

appeal under 437h, although I guess it would have been an

2

interlocutory appeal and not appealable under the general

3

appeal statute.

4

MR. STEELE:

That seems to be -- it seems almost

5

there to be a bootstrapping, it seems to me that they took

6

half the loaf and I would argue, anyway, that by not obeying

7

the commands of 437h, they therefore despite the statement

8

in there, in their opinion, were not hearing the case pur­

9

suant to their 437h jurisdiction.

MR. STEELE:

They said they were.

diction under 437h, appellate jurisdiction.

22

that they had no jurisdiction?

QUESTION:

In any event, Mr. Steele, if in fact --

10

I understand that the district court had jurisdiction.

11

I know you argued it didn't, but if it did, then what the

12

Court of Appeals said in their opinion, that they were sitting

13

under 35 and not under 437h, would be immaterial?

14

MR. STEELE:

I think that's correct.

I think, how­

15

ever, that the opinion of the Court of Appeals as the opinion

16

of the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit suggests, that

17

the courts of appeals are concerned to understand whether or

18

not they are required, every time there is an arguable const!-'

20

quired to sit en banc.

21

there was appropriate jurisdiction to decide this case because

they had rested it in part on 437h, though I would argue that

23

their failure to follow it would destroy the jurisdiction.

here is that you really get a bifurcation, you get a bifurca­

We had announced our

But the pendency of the pro­

10

tion in the sense that the question, the constitutional

11

question goes up in its barest form; meanwhile the other pro­

12

ceeding continues; and you get a waste of resources both at

13

the Commission, but more prominently, you really get a great

14

loss of resources in the courts of appeals.

15

banc -- of course, the 5th Circuit is now being split so the

16

20 to 4 is no longer there, but as Mr. Zimmerman has indicatec

17

the 9th Circuit is now approaching that difficulty too.

18

that's an immense use of judicial resources, so that an indi­

19

cation that they could narrowly construe their jurisdiction

20

and refuse to hear those questions, I think, would avoid this

21

whole question of whether or not they're required to sit en

22

banc.

23

QUESTION:

I mean, the en

And

Your view of the jurisdiction is that it

24

determines on a proceeding being pending before the Commis­

25

sion?

As soon as a proceeding is instituted before the
35

1

Commission in some .informal way, the district court will lose

2

j urisdiction?

3

MR.

STEELE:

Well, of course, the proceedings in

4

front of the Commission really don't begin in informal ways.

5

There's a process for filing of a complaint and notice to the

6

parties which sets forth the factual and legal basis.

7

QUESTION:

I meant, is it a formal proceeding

8

before the Commission would dust the district court of juris­

9

diction under 437h?

10

MR.

STEELE:

I would certainly say in those circum­

11

stances it would not.

12

informal proceedings if. the Commission was holding rulemakings

13

on a particular subject or some other forum.

14

not --

15
16

QUESTION:

I'm not sure that there might not be

But it might

Aren't you really asking us to rewrite

the statute?

17

MR.

STEELE:

No, I think that I'm only asking you

18

to say that the statute vests in the courts a discretion under

19

the terms,

20

jurisdiction very, very specialized kinds of cases which

21

raise basically facial issues.

22

facial issue you probably run into matters of statutory

23

construction that are at least peripherally related, but that

24

that was really the sole purpose of 437h.

25

"as may be appropriate," only to take under 437h

QUESTION:

I must agree that in any

We have a facial issue here, don't we?

36

MR. STEELE:

1

Well, you have a facial issue here as

2

well as issues of how it’s applied, because the trial in the

3

court below is related to questions of allocation, is related

4

to other offenses, so that you may have a facial question, but

5

you may never reach it, which is of course the other reason

6

that I would argue that you should limit the jurisdiction is

7

because you may never need to reach that question in this

8

case.

It may be resolved in other fashions.
QUESTION:

9
10
1 1

Procedurally, then, you agree with Judge

Wallace?
MR. STEELE:

I think, yes, I think that the line be­

12

tween -- you asked earlier the question about the line between

13

"as applied" and "facial" and I'm not sure that it is totally

14

clear in all instances, but I think that's a basic line that

15

is sufficiently clear that that should be hewed to; that

16

"as applied" is really remitted by the statute to the advisory

17

opinion proceedings and the 437g enforcement proceedings.

18

I would note in contrast to when the statute was

19

before this Court in Buckley that the advisory opinion section

20

of the statute has been altered in 1979 amendments to allow

21

any person to require of the Commission an interpretation on

22

any transaction they're involved in, so that in vagueness

23

terms the problem that the Court there was concerned with

24

has to some extent been mitigated by the fact that there is

25

an advisory opinion proceeding, where the Commission can
37

1

indicate its interpretation of the law.

So that in effect

2

I think that those proceedings in front of the Commission are

3

adequate to take care of "as applied" situations as opposed

4

to "facial."

5

I would like to turn to the substantive issue here

6

raised, because it seems to me to be one of considerable im­

7

portance.

8

statute, which I think that appellants here do not really

9

contest, is that the Congress had a right to battle the per­

Basically, the underlying thrust of the entire

10

ception that sizable campaign contributions channeled through

11

various sources should not be perceived, that the appearance

12

cannot be there, that sizable campaign contributions, not the

13

public interest, is what controls.

14

In effect, they do not really challenge the overall

15

interest in the statute.

16

me, is to the extent of the limitation.

17

statute sweeps too broadly, that the statute could and does

18

in more limited means achieve the same effect.

19

Their real challenge, it seems to
They argue that the

The question there, it seems to me, is what inter­

20

ests are at stake?

You have, in effect, a statute which seeks

21

to protect the public interest against the corrupting power

22

of money in elections.

23

important individual interests at stake, individual inter­

24

ests in speech and individual interests in association.

25

those are very precious individual freedoms.

On the other side you clearly have

38

And

But this is -not

1

a

statute which proscribes all

2

kinds of speech.

3

Each one of the individual doctors, the 43,000 doctors that

4

are members of this association, can give that association

5

$5,000.

6

candidate of his choice.

7

engage in activities, volunteer activities which are exempted

8

by the statute from the contribution definitions.

Each one of those doctors can give $1,000 to any

QUESTION:

9
10

Indeed, the statute speaks very narrowly.

Each one of those doctors can

So far as contributions go, each doctor

is limited to a total of $25,000 per annum, isn’t he?
MR. STEELE:

11

Yes.

The individual --

And it seems

12

to us that the very rationale that this Court used in

13

approving the $25,000 limitation and the $1,000 limitation on

14

contributions to candidates, is the same rationale that is

15

involved here, to wit:

16

I mean, in effect, that the holding in Buckley in that area

17

was that the contribution limitation served a strong interest

18

in limiting impropriety from permitting unlimited contribu­

19

tions .

20

that you do not have a situation —

Congress could -- and this is quoting from page 30

21

of Buckley -- "provide that the opportunity for abuse inherent

22

in the raising of large contributions could be controlled by

23

contribution limitations."

24

25

And at page 38 of that opinion invalidating the
$25,000 limitation, that same language was used.
39

And what

1

Congress did in 1976 following the Buckley decision in its

2

attempt to try and put the statute, to enact the statutes

3

back after -- to reenact the Commission, et cetera, what it

4

did was to say that, well, what we see is the possibility that

5

if you do not put a limitation on contributions by persons to

6

committees, that you will have inherent in that a system where

7

there will be many more committees, where committees -- either

8

by direct or indirect means, people will not be abiding by the

9

contribution limits, because they will be able to give amounts

10

to this committee, amounts to another committee.

11

sons, unlike individuals, are not limited, so that associa­

12

tions such as CMA could give $5,000 to -- could give unlimitec

13

amounts without the $5,000 limits, to as many committees as

14

they wanted, and that while there are in the statutes the nar­

15

row proscriptions which Mr. Zimmerman has referred to,

16

441a(a)(7), -a(a)(8), and -a(a)(5), limiting conduits, limit­

17

ing, making as a contribution anything done in coordination with

18

candidates, and limiting the proliferation of committees, that

19

the very thrust of the Court's reasoning in upholding the

20

contributions limit previously was that Congress did not need

21

to rely on those prohibitions, that the contribution limits

22

served an independent purpose by, as the Court says,

23

"avoiding the opportunity for abuse inherent in the raising

24

of large contributions."

25

QUESTION:

Because per­

Do you see a constitutional objective,
40

1

a proper constitutional objective, in limiting what you call

2

the proliferation of committees?

3

MR. STEELE:

I think that the legitimate constitu­

4

tional objective there is to deal with the problem that

5

Congress had met under the old statutes that the prolifera­

6

tion of committees was used as a method for avoiding the con­

7

tribution limitations, that the history of the statutes before

8

1971 and the history of the hearings, particularly, I think,

9

in the *47 hearings, are full of the instances that by

10

creating a variety of committees that the then-existing limi­

11

tations were avoided and so I think that there is a very dis­

12

tinct constitutional underpinning for the limitation of the

13

proliferation of committees.

14

I would like to turn momentarily to the charge that

15

there is discrimination here, in the sense that the provision

16

limiting unincorporated associations, all persons, to $5,000,

17

discriminates in a way against those organizations because

18

corporations and labor organizations, which are separately

19

regulated and have been,again since 1907, are permitted to use

20

their internal funds for the costs, of the administrative

21

costs, the very argument that is here made by appellants.

22

In effect, it seems to me that that's a question of

23

classification.

24

is the first statute, again, I would not go back through all

25

the history of these statutes, because I think it's set forth

The Congress over the course -- since 1907

41

1

in the great

trilogy of cases of U.S. v. CIO, the UAW case,

2

and then the Pipefitters' case, of the evolution of these

3

statutes.

4

18 U.S.C. 610, are really a product of the dialogue between

5

this Court and Congress, where Congress having put a total

6

prohibition on corporations and labor organizations, having

7

concluded that those organizations, because of their direct

8

relationship to the economy, deserved specialized treatment;

9

having put that totdl prohibition on, was warned by this

But the provisions now in 441b, back then in

10

Court that that prohibition could not be used as a means of

11

keeping the organization from fostering its communication to

12

its members and of fostering its legitimate purposes.

13

So that you have there a compromise that was worked

14

out back and forth, of course, majorly in the Hansen amend­

15

ment, which was indirectly before this Court but heavily

16

covered in the Pipefitters' decision, saying that the prohibi­

17

tion of direct contributions, to the prohibition of making

18

direct expenditures in elections, is balanced in the statute

19

by provisions that specifically provide for communication and

20

specifically resolved the then-unanswered question under the

21

previous statute, of that one of the matters that could be

22

done was to provide for this kind of administrative support.

23

To suggest, as the dissent below does -- and as I

24

think Mr. Zimmerman does in his argument -- that because

25

Congress in making that balancing out has allowed corporations
42

1

and labor organizations to spend those administrative ex­

2

penses, that that is a benefit that can be seen apart from

3

and distinguished from the overall total scheme of regulation

4

which substantially prohibits corporations and labor organiza­

5

tions in the way that no other persons are, is to suggest,

6

I think, as the majority of the court below indicated, is

7

to suggest a false question.

8
9

Because, in effect, the classification -- I think
the classification of corporations and labor organizations

10

would even withstand strict scrutiny, but I don't think that

11

this Court in looking at that has ever even thought that

12

strict scrutiny applied to such a classification.

13

organizations, what they do is really an offshoot of their

14

economic interests, and that very powerful, very strong

15

economic interest is what has led to the congressional

16

lation of them.

17

But those

regu­

In effect, to sum up the Commission's argument,

18

on the statutory issue, it seems to us that the $5,000 limi­

19

tation on contributions, five time that which could be given

20

by an individual to a candidate of its choice, where that

21

was spoken of as, albeit, a limitation on a matter of First

22

Amendment values, was a limitation that was on speech that was

23

not direct speech, but was really speech that was only -- it

24

was less direct than the independent expenditures issue.

25

the same limitation on the $25,000, that the $5,000 limitatior
43

And

1

on contributions to political committees, serves the same

2

purposes and falls well within the parameters of this Court's

3

decision on contributions in Buckley v. Valeo.

4

Similarly, I think this Court should reject the

5

argument that because Congress in adhering to the express

6

doubts on the constitutionality of the structure of 610,

7

now 441b, had worked out a special system of regulation that

8

you would find invidious discrimination because of that

9

careful constitutional balancing which Congress went through

10

in response to this Court's decisions.

7

MR.

ZIMMERMAN

Yes, Your Honor, and to cause us

to wait for the Commission to file an enforcement proceeding,

9

and to wait for them to move it through the courts, and to

10

rely on the vagaries of their administrative processes lead­

off the resolution of those questions.

you think is right, and then maybe they will bring an action.
