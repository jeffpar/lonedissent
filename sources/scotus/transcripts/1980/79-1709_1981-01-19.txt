ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS JUDITH H. MIZNER, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MS. MIZNER:

7

8

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question of whether consecu­

9

10

tive sentences can be imposed for separately charged viola­

11

tions of two conspiracy provisions of the 1970 Drug Abuse

12

Prevention and Control Act, where those two provisions were

13

violated by what the court below found as a matter of fact to

14

be a single conspiracy with dual objectives.
The facts are briefly that following a seizure of a

15
16

large quantity of marijuana from a freighter on the high seas,

17

petitioners Albernaz and Rodriguez and 16 others were charged

18

on a

19

to import marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. Section 963.

20

Count two charged a conspiracy to distribute marijuana in

21

violation of Section 846.

22

two-count indictment.

Count one charged a conspiracy

Now, the two counts were absolutely identical as to

23

the alleged conspirators, the alleged time and locus of the

24

conspiracy, and the overt acts set forth in furtherance of

25

each count.

They differed only in the object of the
3

1

conspiracy alleged and in the statutory provision that was

2

allegedly violated.
From the outset the prosecution treated the two

3
4

statutory violations as a single conspiracy, stating in his

5

opening that "the conspiracy charged in

6

tually a single conspiracy," for

7

ning was the same, to go find someone with a boat with relia­

8

ble people to go out to sea and meet the freighter.

9

Government's evidence focused on the petitioners' involvement

And the

10

in arranging to bring the marijuana from this freighter

11

offshore to the United States.

12

had enlisted the aid of Drug Enforcement Administration agents

13

to provide the boat to transport the marijuana, the plan

14

never came to fruition.

15

ferred, the Coast Guard moved in and seized the freighter and

16

the petitioners and two others were arrested in Florida later

17

that day.

QUESTION:

However, since petitioners

After some of the cargo was trans­

The conspiracies here were conspiracy to

import and conspiracy to distribute?

20

MS. MIZNER:

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. MIZNER:

Yes.
Nothing about simple possession?
No.

They were charged as simply a con­

23

spiracy to import and a separate count of conspiracy to dis­

24

tribute, but in fact they were based on the same facts and

25

the court below found a single conspiracy.
4

1

QUESTION:

2

MS. MIZNER:

Right.

I understand that.

And indeed the evidence that the

3

court used to permit the finding of a plan to distribute is

4

evidence that was also relevant to the plan to import, and

5

it was evidence that the court found could be inferred a plan

6

to distribute but not a separate, independent, distinct

7

conspiracy to distribute.

8

this finding of a single conspiracy, but affirmed the imposi­

9

tion of the consecutive sentences on a finding of congres­

En banc the 5th Circuit reaffirmed

10

sional intent to authorize; and a finding that there was no

1 1

double jeopardy involved here.

12

In a number of recent opinions this- Court, has

13

stated that in determining whether multiple punishment for

14

separate statutory violations that arise out of the same

15

transaction are permissible,

16

is whether Congress intended to authorize such punishment.

17

If Congress didn't intend to authorize multiple punishment,

18

that's the end of the inquiry.

19

be clear and unambiguous, because criminal statutes must be

20

strictly construed and the rule of lenity requires that

21

ambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

the first and primary question

The congressional intents mus1

What do you have going for you here

besides the rule of lenity?
MS. MIZNER:

The legislative history provides an

affirmative explanation for the existence of the two separate
5

1

conspiracy provisions that has nothing to do with any intent

2

to impose multiple punishment for a single conspiracy that

3

has two objectives that happened to fall on each side of the

4

subchapter line, an artifically divided subchapter line.

5

6
7

QUESTION:

That would not be an argument that re­

lies on the Braverman case?
MS. MIZNER:

No, this is a question of congressional

8

intent, of using the legislative history to show that there

9

is no affirmative congressional intent to impose multiple

10

punishment or that at best it is so ambiguous that the rule

11

of lenity must be applied to it.

12

QUESTION:

13

in Simpson and Busic?

14

MS. MIZNER:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Is the Inquiry pretty much the same as

Yes, Your Honor, it is.
Is the rule of lenity a discretionary

concept, or how would you describe it?
MS. MIZNER:

I suggest that it has constitutional

18

overtones in terms of being based on a desire not to impose

19

punishment, additional punishment, unless Congress has spoken

20

clearly and unambiguously; unless Congress has provided fair

21

and clear, adequate warning.

22

an integral part of due process of law.

23

QUESTION:

Adequate warning and clarity is

But, of course, you don't impose punish­

24

ment initially -- you don't impose punishment initially unless

25

Congress has spoken clearly and unambiguously, so that there's
6

1

nothing different in the second sentence from the first sen­

2

tence in that sense.

3

like in Lanzetta where it's difficult to figure out what it

4

means, you apply the rule of lenity and say, we just don't

5

know what it means and therefore we won't convict.

If Congress has laid down a standard

MS. MIZNER:

6

But this goes beyond that to go beyond

7

a situation where a statute is facially void for vagueness

8

to a situation where it's the application of two statutes

9

to a particular factual situation that -QUESTION:

10

Miss Mizner, the hypothesis for the

1 1

application of the rule of lenity has to be that it's ambi­

12

guous, whether a course of conduct constitutes one offense

13

or two.

14

problem, doesn't there?

There has to be uncertainty about that particular

15

MS. MIZNER:

16

QUESTION:

Well -And if there is uncertainty, then the

17

rule of lenity requires that a court find that the intent was

18

to impose only one punishment.

19

MS. MIZNER:

Isn't that it?

Well it goes beyond that, because

20

Congress may well have not intended to impose multiple punish­

21

ment where two statutes that under a strict application may

22

not be technically the same offense; when those two offenses

23

occur in the same criminal episode or same criminal transac­

24

tion, Congress might not have intended multiple punishment.

25

QUESTION:

Well, exactly.
7

And the rule of lenity

1

has nothing to do with double jeopardy, which is an absolute

2

prohobition.

3

it's not clear that two offenses were intended, then it shall

4

be presumed that there is only one.

But the rule of lenity simply says that when

MS. MIZNER:

5

Isn't that it?

Well, I think it's more than that, thar.

6

a strict application of two offenses are one offense. It de­

7

pends how you're defining that equation.

8

argued that these are not the same offense under the Block-

9

burger test.

10

QUESTION:

The Government has

Well, maybe they're not, but nevertheless

11

Congress, if it's not clear that Congress intended that two

12

separate punishments be imposed, then regardless of any

13

Blockburger test, then the rule of lenity says,only one shall

14

be imposed.

Isn't that correct?

15

MS. MIZNER:

16

QUESTION:

17

Only one .test; that is our position. Yes.
Well, then, that is the rule of lenity,

isn't it?

18

MS. MIZNER:

19

QUESTION:

Yes.
And its hypothesis is that there be an

20

ambiguity as to whether one or two punishments are to be im­

21

posed?

22

MS. MIZNER:

23

QUESTION:

Yes.
And you say there's an obvious ambiguity

24

here, because the courts that have construed it have come out

25

in different ways.

1

MS. MIZNER:

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. MIZNER:

That's one indicium -of ambiguity.
That's one clear indicium of ambiguity.
And another indicium is the way that

4

the Government has treated prosecutions

5

this type of conspiracy, charging them both in one count and

6

in two counts.

7

QUESTION:

that

involve

Would you say that we begin to think

8

about : turning our minds to' the rule of lenity^, and about the .

9

same situation,

10
11

if.

we: -turn to the legislative history, if

we find ambiguity in the statute?
MS. MIZNER:

But not otherwise?

Well, I believe that you can look at

12

the legislative history even if the language is clear on its

13

face, but I believe that here --

14
15

QUESTION:

Is there a rule that

we look to the --

16

MS. MIZNER:

17

QUESTION:

18

plain meaning rule?

19

We can, but do we?

MS. MIZNER:

It's a discretionary.
If the statute is clear, isn't there the

Well, but this is the kind of case

20

where you're talking about the, not the plain meaning, not

21

the facial clarity of the words themselves, but their joint

22

and simultaneous application to a particular fact content.

23

QUESTION:

Well, if the language of the statute --

24

to go back to Justice Stewart's discussion with you, if the

25

plain meaning of the statute is apparent, do we look either
9

1

to the legislative history or can you give any thought about

2

the rule of lenity?
MS. MIZNER:

3
4

We don't have that situation here be­

cause the -QUESTION:

5

Well, I didn't ask you if we had it.

6

I just said, if.

7

some and not very plain to others.
MS. MIZNER:

8
9

If it's plain, because it might be plain to

Well, in that case I suggest that if

it's plain to some and not to others, then there's an ambi­

10

guity that must be resolved by looking at the legislative

11

history.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

The people who think it's plain are not

likely to believe there's an ambiguity.
QUESTION:

Well, are you contending then that out

15

of the 93 judicial districts in the United States, if you can

16

find one district judge to say that it's ambiguous, the rule

17

of lenity applies because we have one judge saying it's ambi­

18

guous, even though 92 others say it's not ambiguous?

19

MS. MIZNER:

I'm saying that might be one indicia

20

of ambiguity, but here we have more than that.

21

utes that on their face say nothing about how they are to be

22

applied in the context of a single conspiracy that's charged

23

as violating both provisions.

When you say there's a single criminal

MS. MIZNER:

9

QUESTION:

10

11

so?
That's true.
And then if the conspiracy is executed,

that's a separate crime, isn't it?
MS. MIZNER:

Yes.

This Court has over the past

12

years -- conspiracy is a somewhat unique area, and this

13

Court and other courts have drawn lines and have said that

14

as a matter of history, tradition, and because you're penal­

15

izing different objectives, you can

spiracy is to punish the agreement which is the evil, rather

than the objective which forms the substantive offense.

19

But looking at the legislative history in this case

20

the Government has conceded that it's silent on the question

21

of multiple punishments.

22

and provides an affirmative explanation for the existence

23

of the two provisions.

24

to impose multiple punishments for a single conspiracy.

25

As proposed to the Congress by the Administration, the

suggest that the House perceived that importation and distri­

1 1

bution posed distinct social evils?

12

MS. MIZNER:

No, I think that what it suggests is

13

a division according to whether these were domestic offenses

14

or whether they were internal-external offenses, in some way

15

to further congressional committee jurisdiction.

16

at Section 801 of the Act, which sets out the congressional

tive explanation as to why there are two separate provisions,

as opposed to the one that is proposed by the Administration

17

Right.

The citation is missing and --

Indeed, it is, and I'd like you to give

it to me.
MS. MIZNER:

It is the October 6, 1970, Congres­

sional Record.
QUESTION:

You can do it afterwards, but I'd like

18

you, if you would, write a letter to the Clerk and give us

19

that specific citation.

20

MS. MIZNER:

21

QUESTION:

22

I shall.
I'll confess I tried to find it in a

cursory examination and I would like it.

23

MS. MIZNER:

24

Looking at the statutory structure as well as the

25

I will provide that tomorrow.

legislative history also supports a conclusion that
13

Congress

1

didn't really intend to impose multiple punishment for a

2

single conspiracy because of the possibility that a conspiracy

3

with two objectives that fall in one subchapter are penalized

4

only under one statute, for example, the manufacture-distri­

5

bution, which is analogous to the importation-distribution.

6

And there's no rational basis for assuming that Congress

7

would intend to punish those two types of conspiracies dif­

8

ferently.

And the Government has conceded in its brief -QUESTION:

9

Hiss Mizner, let me pose a hypothetical.

10

Suppose there were a statute that a conspiracy to import and

1 1

distribute shall be punished twice as severely as a conspiracy

12

to do either one alone.

13

violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause?
MS. MIZNER:

14

Would that in your estimation be

Well, I suggest that because of the

15

interplay of two factors, one of which is the unique, somewhat

16

unique aspect of conspiracy law, and the other is the fact

17

that importation and distribution are basically two integrally

18

related and almost inseparable offenses in those circum­

19

stances .

20

21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, what if a person was importing for

his own use?
MS. MIZNER:

I suggest that that's a very rare

circumstance.
QUESTION:
ther it's rare

Well, what difference does it make whe­
common?'

Is it a crime to import for

MS. MIZNER:

10

Yes.

But we're talking about conspi­

racy which is simply the agreement.

thought that there is no difference between importing for
your own personal use and importing for distribution to others.

I'm not suggesting that there's no

difference.

14

I'm suggesting that they are kind of, in most

QUESTION:

Of course they're related.

You don't --

15

if you're going to distribute it, you've got to import it in

16

some way.

17

separate crimes?

18

You're not suggesting they can't be made two

MS. MIZNER:

Well -- oh, no; I'm not suggesting

19

that the substantive offenses cannot be made separate, and

20

I'm not suggesting that if you have two different agreements

21

to do each of those objectives, you couldn't be punished

22

separately.

23

that involves both of those objectives, then it raises ques­

24

tions as to whether this is the place where the Court should

25

draw lines, as it has done in other areas of conspiracy law,

I'm saying that where you have one agreement

15

1

and say that you cannot -- that to subdivide a single agree­

2

ment with two very closely related objectives simply in some

fundamental sense does constitute multiple punishment

the same offense and cannot be imposed consonant with the

5

protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

QUESTION: Well, then you would really'require a meta­

7

physical approach to the thing, that there is only a certain

8

atom, or that you can't split atoms'Of crime, something to

9

that effect?
MS. MIZNER:

10

Well, I'm saying that conspiracy is

1 1

kind of a different animal, particularly this kind of con­

12

spiracy where you don't need, under the drug statute, you

13

don't even need an overt act, it's simply a crime of agreement.

If you sit in a room with someone and agree to commit an

15

offense, you are punishable at that stage.

17

you are punishable at that stage, without anything more.

18
19

QUESTION:

And say the room

And you don't claim that there's any­

thing wrong with that statute?

20

MS. MIZNER:

No.

I suggest that where one agree­

21

ment has two objectives, particularly the two objectives of

22

importation and distribution, that the offense is fundamen­

23

tally singular and cannot be further subdivided.

24
25

In terms of the application of the Blockburger
test

to a determination of legislative intent, the Government
16

1

has argued that any ambiguity that exists can be resolved

2

into a clear congressional intent by relying on the Block-

3

burger test.

4

way of determining legislative intent.

5

opinions this Court has not looked at Blockburger in deter­

6

mining congressional intent.

of determining whether two statutory offenses constitute the

8

same offense,

tend to impose multiple punishment even for two statutes that

11

are technically distinct under this test.

12

Justice Rehnquist noted that where a test generally comes

13

out only one way, it is particularly not a good tool for

14

determining legislative intent which may be yes, may be no.

15

But if the test always comes out one way, it really says

16

nothing about what the Legislature intended.

And even, as

And additionally, it can't be a presumptively

17
18

determinative test, where it results in findings of separate

19

offenses.

20

two statutory violations are the same offense, you can presume

21

there's no congressional intent to multiple punish.

22

is absent a clear congressional intent to the contrary.

23

But it means that if under the test you find that

And this

This is consistent with other techniques of statu­

24

tory construction, in resolving ambiguity in favor of the

25

defendant strict construction.
17

But it only works one way.

1

You can't simply invert it to say that where you have two

2

statutory violations and they're not the same offense, you

3

have a presumption of an intent to impose multiple punishment.

4

It's like saying, here you've got a fruit that's a cherry.

5

You presume it's not yellow.

6

you come up with a fruit that's not a cherry, you presume it

7

is yellow.

8
9

And then you invert that and

It doesn't work logically.
QUESTION:

You cannot simply --

I don't entirely follow that.

You act

as if the criminal justice system that we have carried over

10

from our English system is atotally logical one that if there's

11

a balance on one side there's a balance on another.

12

the defendant has a number of -- the presumption of innocence,

13

proof beyond a reasonable doubt, things going from -- why

14

can't you invert the presumption?

MS. MIZNER:

Now,

I'm saying that the presumption as it

16

stands is in accord with a number of those other protections

17

afforded to a defendant such as --

MS. MIZNER:

Has this Court ever said so?
Specifically?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK I. LEVY, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9

10
1 1

Mr. Levy.

MR. LEVY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control

12

Act of 1970 was designed, as this Court recognized in United

13

States v. Moore, to strengthen existing law enforcement

14

authority in the field of drug abuse.

15

distinct conspiracy provisions in two distinct subchapters.

16

One provision, Section 963, proscribes conspiracy to import

17

a controlled substance. And it authorizes a sentence of

18

imprisonment or a fine

19

specified for the object offense of importation.

20

that

does

not

The Act contains two

exceed the penalty

The other provision, Section 846, proscribes con­

21

spiracy to distribute a controlled substance.

22

thorizes a sentence measured in terms of the object offense

23

of distribution.

24

25

And it au­

Thus a conspiracy having multiple objectives both
to import and to distribute a controlled substance implicates
22

1

both subchapters, each of which authorizes a sentence based

2

on the punishment provided for the underlying substantive of­

3

fense.

4

with distinct offense and penalty provisions, petitioners

5

contend that a conspiracy involving importation and distribu­

6

tion of a controlled substance in violation of Section 963

7

and Section 846 can be punished under only one of these pro­

8

visions and not both.

Notwithstanding the existence of distinct subchapters

Surely nothing in the language or the- structure of

9
10

the Drug Cdntrol Act implies such a result.

1 1

the Act on its face suggests that Sections 846 and 963 estab­

12

lish separate offenses that are subject to cumulative penal­

13

ties.

14

the Blockburger rule.

15

the Court stated that Blockburger is a rule of statutory

16

construction that has been consistently relied on to deter­

17

mine whether Congress has in a given situation provided that

18

two statutory offenses may be punished cumulatively.

19

To the contrary,

Moreover, our interpretation is also supported by
As recently as last term in Whalen,

Similarly, in Iannelli, the Court said that

20

Blockburger serves the function of identifying congressional

21

intent to impose separate sanctions for multiple offenses

22

arising in the course of a single act

23

Unquestionably, the Blockburger test is satisfied here.

24

spiracy to import a controlled substance in violation of

25

Section 963 and conspiracy to distribute a controlled
23

or transaction.
Con­

1

substance in violation of Section 846, each requires proof of

2

a fact that the other does not.
QUESTION:

3

What if it were not the case, then under

4

Blockburger, I suppose, as a matter of statutory construction

5

you would assume absent Some clear indication to the Con­

6

trary that Congress didn't intend double punishment?

7

MR. LEVY:

I think one would assume or presume that.

8

QUESTION:

That's been the rule, at least that's

9

the way, that's the direction Blockburger looks in.

10
11

MR. LEVY:

I think that's correct, but I think

Blockburger --

12

QUESTION:

And our other cases.

13

MR. LEVY:

I think they would --

14

QUESTION:

But if it's the other way,

15

there

are

different punishments?

16

MR. LEVY:

I think it works in both directions.

17

QUESTION:

Yes; yes.

18

MR. LEVY:

I agree.

19

QUESTION:

And so part of this case is whether

20

I think that's right.

these are the same or different offenses?

21

MR. LEVY: Well, the question on the first part of tl

22

case is

23

which we submit is resolved in the first instance by applica­

24

tion of the Blockburger rule.

25

QUESTION:

whether the statutes authorize consecutive sentences,

Well, that's on the assumption that they
24

1

are separate offenses.

2

MR. LEVY:

We think the Blockburger rule, in that

3

terminology, is the means to determine whether they are sep­

4

arate

5

6

offenses

or the same offense.

QUESTION:

But we think it is --

Do you think your colleague agrees with

that or not?

7

MR. LEVY:

No, I believe not;

8

QUESTION:

So part of this case, as I suggest

9

10

as I read --

again, is whether these are separate or the same offenses?
MR. LEVY:

I will only take issue with the charac­

11

terization of whether they are separate or same offenses.

12

We think the question is whether the statute authorizes con­

13

secutive sentences rather than whether in any abstract sense

14

these could be characterized as the same or different.

15

if that is the correct terminology, then we think Blockburger

16

supplies the means to answer your question.

17

QUESTION:

But

Well, I’ll put it the other way, that

18

part of this case is deciding in which direction do we follow

19

Blockburger in this case?

20

MR. LEVY:

That's right.

We submit that Blockburger

21

works in both directions, in that terminology.

22

that's expressed in the Court's recent decisions to under­

23

standing of the Blockburger rule in Whalen and Iannelli, and

24

we think that that's absolutely supported by the Court's de­

25

cisions in the Harris case, the Gore case, and the Blockburger1
25

We think that

1

case itself, in which the Court relied on the rule to hold

2

that consecutive sentences were permissible.

3

Court has already answered the question, and held that Block-

4

burger works in both directions.
QUESTION:

5

So we think the

Well, I suppose, even if it were decided

6

that these were the same offenses, if they were tried toge­

7

ther and sentences, consecutive sentences imposed in the same

8

proceeding, the Government would suggest that there's no dou­

9

ble jeopardy problem?
MR. LEVY:

10

Certainly.

I hope to get to that at

11

the end of my argument, but we think, we agree with peti­

12

tioners in the sense that the first issue in the case for the

13

Court to resolve is whether the statutes authorize the con­

14

secutive sentences.

15

double jeopardy question will be presented here.

16

that that's the first issue that the Court should pass upon.

We submit they do, and therefore the
But we agree

20

us that the Blockburger rule applies to the type of compound

21

and predicate offenses that were at issue in the case.

22

First, after Whalen, it's not completely clear to

QUESTION:

I think my question was, wasn't it,

23

whether or not the same inquiries that were made in Simpson,

24

Busic, and Whalen had to be made to resolve the ;question here?

25

MR. LEVY:

Well, the question in the end was the
26

1

same, whether the statutes authorized consecutive sentences

2

in Simpson.

3

QUESTION:

I think that’s all I said.

4

MR. LEVY:

In that sense we agree with you but I

think the analysis of the particular case here is-much'different.

7

the Court in Simpson and Busic did not employ the Blockburger

test.

suggest that if Blockburger had been met that it would not

11

have given some guidance, indeed, a presumptive guidance, on

12

the intent of Congress to authorize consecutive sentences.

13

Moreover, in those cases the Court found affirma­

14

tive evidence, particularly the statement of Congressman

15

Poff in the rejection of the Dominick Amendment, affirmative

16

evidence to support the conclusion that consecutive sentences

17

were not intended by Congress.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, can I ask you a question about

19

-- I want to be sure I understand what you're saying about

20

the two-way use of Blockburger.

21

offenses satisfy the Blockburger test in the sense that each

22

requires a proof of a fact that the other does not, then one

23

should presume that Congress intended to authorize double

24

prosecution and double punishment, or permit the possibility.

25

MR.

LEVY:

Exactly.
27

You're saying that if two

QUESTION:

And do you also say the converse?

2

MR. LEVY:

Yes.

3

QUESTION:

That if there are two offenses that do

4

not each, or are not mutually exclusive, that then the pre­

5

sumption is, Congress intended to authorize only one punish­

6

ment?

7

MR. LEVY:

We do, with the emphasis on the word

8

presumption.

9

specific legislative history and statute involved in the case.

10

It's a rebuttable presumption based on the

QUESTION:

Well, what would rebut such a presump­

1 1

tion, something express in the Congress saying that even

12

though it's a lesser included offense, we want multiple

13

punishment to be permitted here?

14

MR. LEVY:

That would be one illustration --

15

QUESTION:

It would be a very clear evidence of

16

legislative intent?

17

MR. LEVY:

Right.

I would cite, just as an illus­

18

tration, the Gun Control Act, Section 924c, that makes it

19

clear in terms that the sentences be imposed in addition to

20

the sentence for the underlying federal felony.

21

QUESTION:

Was that Simpson or -- ?

22

MR. LEVY:

We think it's not because Simpson

23

involved only a discrete class of felony as it contained

24

their own enhancement of the provisions.

25

QUESTION:

In other words, the provisions of 924?

Yes, it did.

other, it still would be --

QUESTION:

I understand.

But that would be clear

on the face of the statute?
MR. LEVY:

Exactly.

And that's one illustration of

14

evidence that would rebut the inference that arises from

15

Blockburger.

16
17
18
19

QUESTION:

But in this case, you rely basically just

on the Blockburger rule itself -- ?
MR. LEVY:

That's our principal reliance here, and

we think that's the first rule that should be applied --

20

QUESTION:

Naturally.

21

MR. LEVY:

-- in any case.

22

QUESTION:

But that depends on your being able to

convince us or somebody that these are separate offenses, in

the Blockburger sense?

14

are separate statutory offenses under Sections 943 and 846.

Petitioners offer two arguments to rebut the

First, that the

2

a clear intention to allow cumulative penalties for a single

quires the construction that consecutive sentences are not

It is common ground between petitioners and our­

7

selves that the legislative history is silent on the precise

8

question of consecutive sentences for conspiracy to import

9

and to distribute a

controlled

substance.

However, it is

10

unrealistic to demand, as Petitioners do, that Congress focus

11

its attention on every conceivable issue of statutory inter­

13

every potential question that might subsequently be litigated

QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, do you have any comment on

the opposition's reliance on Senator Dodd's statement?
34

MR. LEVY:

1

We have a citation in our brief to a

2

similar statement by a Representative saying that the bill

3

that was enacted was essentially the House version rather

4

than the Senate version, and I think that's supported by the

5

conference report.

6

Congress never specifically focused on the question of con­

7

secutive sentences, and therefore it was never confronted in

8

an immediate way with any difference that might exist between

9

the House version and the Senate version in that regard.

But the honest answer, I think, is that

10

The Congress did enact the House version, it did enact the

1 1

statute that has two distinct conspiracy provisions that meet

12

the Blockburger rule, and we think in those circumstances

13

consecutive sentences are authorized.
QUESTION:

14

Mr. Levy, do you see anything to the

15

petitioners' position that this was argued as a one-conspiracy

16

case?

17

MR. LEVY:

No, I don't believe so.

poses the question in this case rather than answers it.

10

I guess: Congress could do that.
MR. LEVY:

I believe it could.

Because there are

two separate evils and Congress has the right, particularly

12

in the area of gun control, to enact stiff sentences, stiff

Petitioners contend that the existence of two

conspiracy provisions is purely adventitious and merely

16

reflects the fortuity that two different committees consid­

20

history is equally consistent, we believe, with the inference

22

that the House committees focusing on two distinct govern­

23

mental interests concluded that a conspiracy encompassing

importation and distribution comprised dual evils that should

be subject to enhanced penalties.

From the outset, the legislation in the House con­

10
11

sisted of two bills, each containing its own conspiracy

provision, and Congress in passing the Comprehensive Drug

Control Act was unquestionably aware of the separate conspir­

15

understanding was that under the well-established Blockburger

16

doctrine cumulative penalties would be available for the

17

distinct conspiracy offenses defined in Sections 846 and

18

963.

19

petitioners suggest, that the existence of separate conspira­

20

cy provisions was a mere accident of the legislative process,

21

and that Congress never intended to authorize consecutive

22

sentences.

MR. LEVY:

In

if you had one conspiracy, one prohi­

I think one would have to follow a dif­

7

ferent analysis on that.

I believe that Braverman likely

8

would certainly be highly illuminating if not controlling

9

in those circumstances.

It is conceivable, however, in the

10

legislative history in some other way Congress would have

11

indicated an intent to authorize consecutive sentences.

12

In that situation, by analogy -QUESTION:

13
14

Suppose you didn't have anything besides

the face of the statute to decide on?
MR. LEVY:

15

That's right.

But that situation arose,

16

for example, in the Callanan case where the Hobbs Act, in a

17

single section, proscribes both conspiracy and substantive

18

offenses.

19

but a single provision, both the conspiracy and the substan­

20

tive offense could be cumulatively punished.

21

And this Court held that even though there was

QUESTION:

Now, my question is whether you could

22

punish the conspiracy twice because it had two separate

23

objects in that situation I gave you?

I think you'd say no.

24

MR. LEVY:

My assumption is that one could not.

25

QUESTION:

Yes, because there's only one prohibition
40

1

against conspiracy?

2

MR. LEVY:

That's correct.

That was essentially

3

the analysis that was followed in Braverman.

But that is not

4

a constitutional requirement.

5

QUESTION:

I understand.

6

QUESTION:

You mean unless Congress said so?

7

MR. LEVY:

Exactly.

But after some specific indi­

8

cation, I'think the strong inference would be that the single

9

conspiracy provision could only give rise to one sentence.

10

Petitioners' second argument to rebut the Block-

1 1

burger rule, their rule of lenity analysis, is also unavail­

12

ing.

13

in Callanan, the notion of lenity is one guide to be used in

14

discerning legislative intent where an ambiguity otherwise is

15

present.

16

the Court in Callanan, "The rule is a guide to statutory

17

construction and comes into operation at the end of the pro­

18

cess of construing what Congress has intended, not at the

19

beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient

20

wrongdoers."

21

As this Court has recognized in such cases as Busic and

In the words of Mr. Justice Frankfurter writing for

22

unnecessary to resort to the rule of lenity.

23

case, two distinct statutory provisions satisfy the Block-

24

burger tests, it is to be presumed that offenses under those

25

provisions are subject to cumulative penalties.
41

If, as in this

Indeed, the very purpose of a Blockburger standard

1

2

is to answer the question of consecutive sentences in the

3

absence of a specific indication of congressional intent.

4

And therefore Blockburger serves to resolve any ambiguity that

5

might otherwise call for application of the rule of lenity.
Lenity cannot, by itself, be used to defeat the

6
7

Blockburger doctrine, and we are unaware of any decision in

8

which this Court has found the Blockburger test to be satisfied

9

and yet nonetheless relied on the rule of lenity to prohibit

10

the imposition of cumulative penalties.

11

Petitioners' counsel also relied on the fact that

12

there are divergent authorities among the courts of appeals

13

on the proper construction of these conspiracy provisions.

14

We don't think --

QUESTION:

And I suppose you would say, if it

Well, it may be, but if each requires

proof of a fact that the other one doesn't, they can be tried

MR. LEVY:

The statute would allow them to be tried

separately.

one that isn't present here, whether

What question would it be?

MR. LEVY:

QUESTION:

7

than --

That would be the question, whe­

10

ther the offenses are the same or different offenses, and

11

even if they were different offenses, as the Court held, for

12

example, in Harris v. Oklahoma and In Re: Nielsen, the double

13

jeopardy clause might still bar successive prosecutions.

14

That would rest, I suppose, on some notion of finality for

15

the defendant's benefit, of an interest that simply was not

16

presented in the context of multiple punishments following

17

a single trial and a single sentencing proceeding.

QUESTION:

the use of Blockburger as a statutory construction aid,

no different from the question of whether the legislature has

authorized multiple punishments.

10

QUESTION:

11

as a constitutional doctrine?

12

MR. LEVY:

Blockburger at any rate did not originate

It did not.

The Blockburger case itself

13

was a question of statutory construction, as were the suc­

14

ceeding cases in Gore and Harris, among others.

15

Petitioners' counsel seeks to find an ambiguity in

16

the statute because courts of appeals have diverged on a pro­

17

per construction of the conspiracy provisions.

18

point out, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested, that virtually

conflict in the circuits, including those cases in which the

Court applies, finds that the meaning of the statute is plain

on its face, or declines to apply the rule of lenity.
