ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE S. GOLD, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLD:

please the Court:
This case which is here on a writ of certiorari to

10

11

15
16

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the 3rd Circuit concerns the status of suits brought on national
union constitutions under Section 301 of the Labor-Management
Relations Act of 1947.

That provision states, and I quote from

page 2 of our opening brief, the blue brief:

"Suits for vio­

lations of contracts between an employer and a labor organiza­
tion representing employees in an industry affecting commerce
as defined in the Act or between any such labor organizations

17

may be brought in any district court of the United States having
18

jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in
19

controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the par­
20

ties ."
21

This case, as that makes clear, is about the second
22

clause of that section.

At the present time, three courts of

23

appeals, the 2nd, 4th, and 6th have taken the position that
24

national union constitutions are within that jurisdictional
25

grant.

2

view, and six other courts of appeals have taken the view that

3

the jurisdictional question depends on whether the actions af­

4

fect labor-management relations and have stated that test in

5

widely varying ways.

6

One court of appeals, the 10th, has taken the opposite

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, isn't there a certain undesira­

7

bility in the test advanced by the last six circuits that you

8

mentioned, you don't know when you go into court whether there

9

is jurisdiction or not, depending on a whole bunch of factors?

10

11
12
13

MR. GOLD:

Our position, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in

part for the consideration you just stated, is that national
constitutions fit the language of the statute, fit the purposes
of Section 301, and are within the section.

We do not believe

that the better view is that the parties by their pleadings or
14

the courts by going though a factual inquiry should be deciding
15

this matter on a case-by-case basis.

We think that that com­

16

plicates the administration of the law and is not necessary
17

in any way to carry out the proper view of the statute.
18

QUESTION:

Well, there is that other view that the

19

union constitution shouldn't ever be withih this.
20

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

QUESTION:

That would make it simple too, wouldn't it?

MR. GOLD:

That's right.

21

22

There is no doubt that the

23

risks of disagreeing with Mr. Justice Rehnquist, or- of agreeing
24

with him, are there.

There are two different straightforward

views,

I am going to state yes is the proper answer rather than no.

3

Obviously, if the Court doesn't agree that yes is the answer and

4

maybe would be a better answer as far as we're concerned than

no, but we do think that yes is the proper approach.

The Court has so held.

That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

MR. GOLD:

Yes, under Textile Workers v. Lincoln

QUESTION:

What kind of law will govern this dispute?

Federal law of 'interpreting international union’constitutions?
21

MR. GOLD:

That’s right, Your Honor, it would be

22

the task, and our view would be the same as the task the Court
23

outlined in a case like Carbon Fuel In 444 U.S. where you
24

dealt with the question of how to interpret a collective

QUESTION:

2

Of course, there's a lot of

a contract, and one of them breached the contract.

Would that

I think that that would be.

MR. GOLD:

It

I would think that in most cases the

10

federal law would adopt the state law, but there is no dispute,

11

unless we're going to throw the statute entirely over our

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

shoulder, that it covers contracts between labor organizations.
The posit which is opposed to our view that the statute means
what it says is that there ought to be coverage only for con­
tracts between unrelated labor organizations.

Your examples

have been between unrelated organizations, and it is more com­
mon, I think, to have those kinds of property or contractual
relations between unrelated organizations than otherwise.
What would happen if you were to cut out agreements

19

between related organizations is that the section would not
20

cover matters which we think certainly were at the forefront of
21

Congress's attention, agreements about work jurisdiction, who
22

should be the collective representative, mergers, affiliations,
23

no raiding, pacts within unions.

All of these matters, which

24

certainly on any fair meaning of the term affect how management
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

7

1

and labor work out their disputes, would be within the section.

2

I do not know in terms of the series of hypotheticals you have

3

given any indication, aside from the theory that you would

4

import a limitation on affecting labor management relations,

5

to reach the result that an agreement between Union A and

6

Union B concerning a promissory note, which is one of the exam­

7

ples given by respondent, would be outside the section if the

8

entities are unrelated.

9

QUESTION:

But Section 301(a) by its terms has simply

10

conferred jurisdiction, it doesn't say what body of law shall

11

be applied.

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

MR. GOLD:

Yes, but as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed

out, the Court in the Lincoln Mills decision, it construed
Section 301 to call for the creation not only of jurisdiction
but of federal law.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think that we're bound by

Lincoln Mills to construe the example Justice Stevens gave you
as governed by federal law?
MR. GOLD:

I would say, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that

19

it would be, that you would reenter the very difficult dispute
20

which the Court confronted first in the Westinghouse case and
21

then in Lincoln Mills as to constitutional questions, whether
22

you can simply provide jurisdiction without substantive law.
23

It was not without quite a lengthy and considered dialogue with­
24

in the Court that that conclusion was reached, and over a very
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

8

1

vigorous dissent by Hr. Justice Frankfurter.
QUESTION:

2
3

Certainly in diversity cases we provide

jurisdiction without providing substantive law.
MR. GOLD:

4

Well, that is provided for in the Consti­

5

tution.

6

under the Commerce Clause Congress could do the same, and the

7

answer was

8

material, to provide for a body of federal law, and (b) that

9

that intent had to be read against the background of a constitu­

10

The question, as I remember Lincoln Mills, was whether

(a)

that it was Congress's intent, reading all the

tional doubt.
But, in saying that it would seem to me that if you

11

had a situation in which local A rented a building to local B
12
13

there is no reason to believe that the federal law would be a
law different from the law of the state.

That would be a natura 1

14

place to absorb the state law.

After all, the purpose of

15

Section 301 overall was to deal with the difficulties and im­
16

perfections of state law in permitting parties to enforce con­
17

tracts.

That was the overriding interest to the extent that

18

federal law -19

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, do you have any examples in 301

20

cases of borrowing state law with the result that you do not
21

have a uniform rule?
22

MR. GOLD:

On statutes of limitation, at least, out­

23

side of the area which we hope the Court will reach on duty of,
24

hybrid duty of fair representation, Section 301 cases.
25

9

That is

1

an area where the Court concluded

2

QUESTION:

So you would suggest -- you don't suggest

3

that as an ironclad rule that one of the purposes of 301 and of

4

Lincoln Mills was to end up with a uniform federal rule in

5

every contracts case?

6

MR. GOLD:

No, I think the Court --

7

QUESTION:

That it would be consistent with its

8

history to say that in the proper cases you could borrow?
MR. GOLD:

9
10

11
12
13
14

Yes.

If I can backtrack just very briefly

to the facts, this case concerns an effort by the international
union to merge local unions in an area of New Jersey.

The

international union proceeded as provided under the internationa 1
constitution, an order of consolidation was promulgated, a
hearing was held, in which the affected unions could state
their views, a hearing officer's decision was issued, it was

15

reviewed by the international president and by the general
16

executive board and finally promulgated.

At that point one of

17

the local unions affected by the proposed merger went into state
18

court.

There was a complaint and an amended complaint.

The

19

amended complaint, which is on page, begins on page 54 of the
20

Appendix, states among other points that the defendant is an
21

international labor organization consisting of many locals in
22

New Jersey and elsewhere throughout the United States and
23

Canada, and that the relationship (rights and duties) between
24

Local 334 and the international is governed by the said
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

10

1

constitution.

2

actions of the general president do not constitute a consolida­

3

tion of local unions within the meaning of the constitution and

4

therefore the order insofar as it applies to plaintiff is ille­

5

gal.

6

issue between the parties was the meaning of Section 86 of the

7

national constitution which is set out at page 25 of the record

8

and provides for the merger of local unions.

9

The gravamen of the first count was that the

Plainly from what I have said, the issue and the primary

Our basic position is that national constitutions

10

insofar as they determine the relationship between the national

11

and locals, and between locals inter se, are contracts between

12
13
14

labor organizations representing employees in an industry
affecting commerce.

We are proceeding in this instance without

secondary guidance aside from the words of the statute to which
I have already referred.

The second clause, the clause on con­

15

tracts between labor organizations, was added in conference and
16

the conferees did not explain their intent.
17

In that instance we believe, in such an instance we
18

believe that the proper approach is to consult the ordinary
19

contemporaneous meaning of the terms, and as we show at some
20

length in our brief, both as a matter of federal law under
21

the current, leading Coronado case of this Court by Mr. Chief
22

Justice Taft and uniformly, so far as we can tell, under state
23

law, constitutions have been regarded as contracts in the law.
24

After all, they are agreements, serious agreements, which the
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

11

1

parties intend to define their relationship and the courts have

2

recognized them as such.

3

We think, too, that the reading we suggest is in ac­

4

cord with the basic purpose of Section 301.

5

stated,

6

bringing suit against unions as unincorporated associations.

7

Congress didn't overestimate that difficulty.

8

and the House report are very careful compilations of the

9

diversity in state law on the question of how to sue an unin­

15

As I have already

Congress was concerned about the difficulties of

corporated association, when you can get jurisdiction, when
you can't, what the prerequisites are, and the difficulties of
obtaining relief.
The purpose of Section 301 is to end those difficul­
ties and to provide in Congress's terms a high level of respon­
sibility between labor organizations and employers when they
enter into agreements, and obviously between labor organizations

16

because that is what the language says.
17

I think, too, that the evolution of the section, the
18

fact that Congress completed its work in the House and the Senat
19

and went to conference and said, this section is incomplete as it
20

stands because it only covers contracts between employers and
21

labor organizations, indicates that Congress must have been of
22

the view that contracts between labor organizations ought to be
23

enforceable

in:

the same way as contracts between labor organi­

24

zations and employers in order to accomplish the congressional
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

12

1

end, and we think that in light of what Congress said and what

2

it did that the language ought to be accorded its fair meaning.

3

We think that this case is very much like Harrison v. PPG

4

Industries in 446 U.S. where you had to grapple with a juris­

5

dictional provision dealing with the scope of authority of the

6

courts of appeals under, I believe it was, the Clean Water Act and

7

the question was whether any other final action meant any other

8

final action or only some final actions.

9
10
11
12
13
14

We think in this instance contracts means what it is
ordinarily, contracts between labor organizations means what
that term would normally have meant to the people who drafted
the section, who were well aware -QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, are you arguing in effect that in

constitutional terms, going back to Article III, that every
time -- this statute having been enacted, every time one union

15

sues another it's a case arising under the laws of the United
16

States, within the meaning of the Constitution, regardless of
17

what -- even if they say that they're suing them for some kind
18

of a state tort or whatever it might be?
19

MR. GOLD:

No, it has to be a suit on a contract be­

20

tween two labor organizations and Congress decided that in pre­
21

ference to the variation, complexity, and difficulty of deter­
22

mining when such suits will be entertained, that it was going
23

to state a federal law which again, as the Court said in Carbon
24

Fuel and was presaged by the Coronado, case in which the entities ,

the local unions if there are two; the national and the local,

if that is the situation; are to be treated as entities very

4

much like corporations, that's the model.

5

to permit suit.

6

- the national unions, if there are two;

And you were going

Now, the Court in Lincoln Mills, when it was con­

7

fronted with the question of could Congress so act, came to the

8

conclusion that it was Congress's intent and it might have been

9

a necessity to provide a body of federal law.

10
11
12
13
14

QUESTION: Of course, here you have-rather comprehensive
regulation by statute of the relationship between the collective
bargaining agent on the one hand and the employer on the other.
There really are no set of federal rules of which I am aware
that comprehensively regulate relationships among different
labor unions, which may or may not be affiliates, which may en­

15

ter into all sorts of contracts.

And you're suggesting that

16

there's a very broad grant, by the creation of a very broad area of
17

federal law that every such contract shall hereafter be inter­
18

preted by reference to some substantive rule of federal law
19

that has not yet been identified.
20
MR. GOLD:

Well, I'm not contending anything concern­

21

ing the relations, the contractual relations between unaffiliat^d
22
labor organizations.

That isn't in this case.

This case is

23

whether agreements -24

QUESTION:

But in terms of the statute or the

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

14,

1

Constitution, what difference does it make whether the unions

2

are affiliated?

3

MR. GOLD:

Oh, I agree that I don't see how there

4

could be a dispute about the point you just raised.

5

words, I do not understand except if we go to the expedient of

6

saying that the contract has to be one which relates to labor-

7

management relations, how the statute could possibly be said

8

not to cover contracts between unrelated labor organizations.

9

I know of no case which suggests that the statute would not do

10

11
12
13
14

In other

so, but the dispute between the parties here is whether that rul e
even

assuming

the

gloss of affecting labor-management rela­

tions, applies at all to national constitutions.

We're not

talking of, this is not a suit on a promissory note.

We're

talking about a situation in which an international union
sought to merge local unions in a way which would change the

15

hiring hall patterns in the area and change the nature of the
16

collective bargaining representative.
17

Certainly we believe that in that situation, since
18

the fight was over what the national constitution meant, since
19

national constitutions have been understood to be contracts,
20

and since on any -- what we would consider, under any sensible
21

view, the merger affects labor-management relations, that's
22

within 301.
23

QUESTION:

But you also are contending then that

24

there is some federal rule of law that answers this dispute?
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

15

5

1

MR. GOLD:

I think we say that the federal, the ques­

2

tion of how to interpret this section, just as the question of how

3

the courts act in interpreting a collective agreement, is to be

4

determined as a matter of federal law rather than state law.

5

After all, this is the law of contracts.

6

about the federal courts saying what the relationship should be.

7

The only federal law concerns the rules of construction and

8

9
10
11

We're not talking

interpretation.
QUESTION:

Well, now, in Lucas Flour we said we hold

that in a case such as this, incompatible doctrines of local
law must give way to principles of federal labor law.

But

first of all, I think you'd have to find that there's something
12

in the local law that's incompatible, wouldn't you?
13
MR. GOLD:

Yes, I would think that -- and that was

14
why I answered Mr. Justice White's question the way I did.
15
Where the federal courts have to create a body of law, we don't
16
believe that the normal course is to start from scratch.

It's

17
a process of incorporation except in the case of incompatibility
18
It's difficult for me to visualize an incompatibility between
19
federal law and state law if the dispute is on whether a local
20
union which owes another local union that is unrelated $500
21

has in fact violated a promissory note.
22
I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

24
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN AXELROD, ESQ.,
25

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

16

Mr. Axelrod.

1

2

MR. AXELROD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

3

With apparent seriousness, the United Association

4

asked this Court to literally interpret the provision in Section

5

301 which provides jurisdiction for suits upon contracts between

6

labor organizations.
Beginning at least in 1819 with the Dartmouth College

7
8

case this Court has recognized that the meaning of contract is

9

not clear and that the word contract cannot be literally con­

10
11
12
13
14
15

strued.

In Lion Dry Goods, where this Court for the first time

discussed the definition of the word contract in Section 301,
the Court again said the definition is not without ambiguity.
In Sidell the 7th Circuit in a case similar to this again said,
this issue is not without ambiguity.
But assuming that this Court will choose to interpret
the statute literally and to conclude that any dispute between

16

a local union and a national union is a contract between labor
17

organizations, this Court will then direct federal courts to
18

supervise the most mundane relationships between local union
19

and parent and member.
20

For example, a constitutional provision requires a

rather than suits between employer

and labor

And it permitted an individual employee who

wanted to allege a breach of contract to sue in federal court
or to sue in state court alleging a breach of a contractual
obligation owed to him.

15

Insofar as Smith would

apply to this case, if an

16

individual employee could sue upon a collective bargaining
17

agreement in which he is at best a third-party beneficiary,
18

then an individual union member could sue under a union consti­
19

tution which he is at least a third-party beneficiary of.

It is also clear that an individual union member is a party to

the union constitution.

But if' there is ho grievance procedure

15

he may sue the employer directly, as the second step.
16

MR. AXELROD:

That's Smith.

The issue in this case

17

is also a relatively mundane one,

the issue of whether the

18

word "consolidation" in Section 86 of the United Association's
19

contract permits the severance of a local into two constituent
20

parts in the guise of merging nine locals into three.

The legislative

In both its'-original brief and in its reply brief the United
Association says, "Union members should remain

free to

decide what the provisions of their constitution shall be."
The United Association's constitution provides for

two methods of amendment of the constitution.

The first is

at

its

constitutional conventions and its conventions at which

members are represented in a form of representational govern­

MR. AXELROD:1
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

That’s your problem.

MR. AXELROD:

That’s my position; yes.

The purposes

of Section 301 were to prevent disruptions in interstate com­
merce caused by unions which breach collective bargaining
agreements, or caused by secondary boycotts or caused by union
misconduct in organizing campaigns.

It’s clear that the

impetus for Section 8(b) of the Act came from employers who
were complaining to Congress.

There is no evidence that any

member of a labor organization complained to Congress and said,
18

I cannot enforce the provisions of my union constitution.

And

19

the reason that no individual member was complaining was be­
20

cause in at least 45 of the then-48 states and perhaps in 47
21

of the 48 states, individual union members had the right to
22

sue either their union or the officers of their union who
23

allegedly breached the union constitution.

Now that right

24

was not perfect, but it was effective, and a member who was

That right has existed since the

The issue in Section 301, therefore, is what type

12

of contracts between labor organizations presented the same
13

problem which employers faced in Section 301 litigation under
14

collective bargaining agreements?
15

Because members always had the right to sue their
16

union under the law of associations, the issue is then, which
17

contracts between labor organizations involved entities which
18

were not part of the same association?

The labor organizations

19

which are not part of the same association within the meaning
20
of the state laws were a suit between one national union and
21

another national union, a contract between two national unions
22

involving no-raid agreements, involving jurisdictional dispute
23

mechanisms, involving the affiliation into a confederation such as
24

the AFL-CIO.

Those were the types of contracts which could not

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

26

1

be litigated simply because the parties to the contracts were

2

not part of the same association and did not have the right of

3

recourse to state law under the law of associations which was

4

prevalent in almost all of the states.
If you accept the position of the United Association

5
6

in this case this Court will be requiring the federalization of

7

yet another area of state law.

of these areas of state law, it will be simple to say that we

But that law will then become federal law, and if the law in

QUESTION:

Well, would you argue that uniformity was

the pervasive concept of the labor laws, the federal labor laws?

for determining certain types of labor disputes.

13
14

Well, I'd first like to state that I

disagree with Mr. Gold's interpretation of the state laws.
In Trail, which is the 6th Circuit case I think he's relying
upon, the Court said, we're not going to reach the Section 301
breach of the union constitution issue because all these facts
can be determined in the fair representation case which we have
before us.

So we're not going to reach Section 301.
In Parks, which I believe is the 4th Circuit case he

15

is relying upon, the Court said, this dispute has a traumatic
16

impact on interstate commerce on labor-management relations.
17

And the dispute there involved the right to strike, the union's
13

right to strike.

I think Parks can be properly classified as

19

one of the Court's taking the intermediate position.
20

Now, under our interpretation of the intermediate
21

position, we would take the position espoused by Parks, by
22

Baker, by 1199, by Sidell, by Local 1219 of the Carpenters.
23

All of those cases deal with disputes in which all of those
24

cases take the position that there must be concrete evidence of

The only harm suffered by anyone if the

There is no evidence in this case of any harm to an

8

employer of any disruption in labor-management relations.

9

even if you apply the substantial impact test which the 3rd

Circuit applied, we think the 3rd Circuit reached the proper
conclusion.
In Local 1219, which the United Association relies

12
13
14

So

upon, there was an ongoing dispute between seven local unions
and that ongoing dispute prompted a number of employers to file
unfair labor practice charges.

Obviously, in that case,

15

employers

were involved and employers were harmed.

Employers

16

were forced to make difficult choices between competing claims
17

for recognition.

There is no allegation in this case that an

18

employer was forced to make any choice.

If the order of consoli

19

dation was enforced, Local 334 would cease its existence and
20

other local unions would assume its contracts.

If the order is

21

not enforced, Local 334 will remain in existence and there will
22

be no change.

You'd either have a motion to

MR. AXELROD:

HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Axelrod, you may con­

tinue .

3

MR. AXELROD:

The pending question, I believe, is

4

whether there would be an evidentiary hearing if the Court

5

adopts the substantial impact test.

6

The majority of the courts that have considered the issue in

7

cases in which the plaintiff alleged Section 301 jurisdiction

8

have looked to the allegations of the complaint.

9

considered whether the complaint states broad conclusory alle­

10
11

14

They have

gations or whether the complaint states specific facts which
demonstrate an impact on labor-management relations.
QUESTION:

12
13

And the answer is, perhaps.

But if this suit had been filed in the

federal court in the first instance and there had been a motion
to dismiss on the grounds that Section 301 did not provide
jurisdiction in this case, there would have been an argument

15

on the law.

And if the district court agreed, it would have

16

been dismissed.
17

MR. AXELROD:

That's correct.

There was an argument

18

on the law

and the district court agreed with the position of

19

the United Association here.
20

QUESTION:

Yes.

21

MR. AXELROD:

But in the normal case, if there are

22

conflicting factual allegations, the motion to dismiss would
23

become a motion for summary judgment and if the Court concluded
24

that one party alleged facts which would lead to jurisdiction
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

under Section 301 and the other party controverted those facts,

2

then there would have to be an evidentiary hearing to determine

3

whether there was Section 301 jurisdiction.

4
5

QUESTION:

And that wouldn't necessarily -- as a mat­

ter of fact, it wouldn't be a hearing on the merits?
MR. AXELROD:

6

It would be a hearing solely on the

done in 1959.
QUESTION:

But isn't there some difference between

union affairs in the sense of the relation of the members of

the union to the union itself as opposed to the relationship

between two separate unions?

MR. AXELROD:

Two separate unions?

If by that you

mean two national unions?

Two separate locals or two separate

12

QUESTION:

13

Mr. Axelrod, can I ask you, do you take

the position that any dispute between two international unions,
14

arising out of a contract between two international unions,
15

even one for the sale of an office building or something, would
16

give rise to jurisdiction under this statute?
17

MR. AXELROD:

Section 301 was designed to resolve dis­

18

putes affecting interstate commerce and the Court perhaps could
19

conclude that a contract for the sale of real estate or a lease
20

of office space was not a contract affecting interstate com­

QUESTION:

Well, assuming it's a contract that affects

interstate commerce but has no other relationship to any federal

MR. AXELROD:

Section 301 does not distinguish between

types of suits and types of contracts.

MR. GOLD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE S. GOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL

15

MR. GOLD:

In this time I'd like to try to cover four

16

basic points.

The central argument that has continuously been

17

made by respondent in this case is that

Section 301 does not

18

cover contracts between related organizations.

It would read

19

the section to say, contracts between nonrelated organizations,
20

even though that is not the word of the statute.
21

We think that that position which is based on the
22

policy against regulating internal affairs, stated in the
23

National Labor Relations Act, is wrong in principle.

First of

24

all, as Section 301(a)'s first clause shows, the clause on
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

37

1

collective bargaining and other contracts between employers

2

and unions, Congress at the same time passed Section 8(d) of

3

the NLRA which says the Government can't control the substantive

4

terms of bargaining, and passed Section 301 which says that the

5

bargain reached by the employer and union is enforceable.

6

Obviously, Cdngrebs was not using the concept of regulation in

7

the sense of enforcing an agreement between parties.

8
9
10

11

Indeed, we think that respondent overstates the policy
against intervening in union affairs.

As this Court said in the

Boeing case, which is the most recent one in point and cited by
respondent, and I'm quoting from 412 U.S. 73, "The reason for
this determination not to reach certain fines was that Congress

12
13

had not intended by enacting Section 8(b)(1)(A) to regulate the
internal affairs of the unions to the extent that would be re­

14

quired in order to base unfair labor practice charges on the
15

levying of such fines."

In other respects Congress did indeed

16

regulate in any terms.
17

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, I thought Mr. Axelrod argued that

18

a union international constitution is not a kind of contract
19

with its constituent locals, but it is a contract with the
20

union members, and therefore not a contract between labor
21

organizations, which is the language of 301.
22

MR. GOLD:

Right.

That is the second argument that

23

respondent makes.

It is made for the first time on oral argu­

24

ment but it's never been contended before.

We think it is

25
North American Reporting

38

1

contrary to the law.

2

fittingly enough is from New Jersey, Harris v. Geier, and the

3

language which we quote in our reply brief, the yellow brief,

4

page 5, is that constitution and bylaws of the International

5

Brotherhood constitute a contract between the members of Local

6

461 inter se and between them and the general body of member­

7

ship of the brotherhood, and between the local and the joint

8

council and other agencies of the brotherhood.
This suit is a suit by a local union seeking to keep

the UA.

jurisdiction

and

its

charter from

It's a suit between two organizations about their

relationship and in common sense and in the law it's a suit
between labor organizations.
Mr. Axelrod is quite right, and we agree, and we said
we agreed, in our reply brief, that there are other suits based

15

on union constitutions which concern the contract between the
16

union and the member.

If a union member complains about disci­

17

pline, as the quotation I read indicates, he is suing on his
18

contract with the union and under the plain language of Section
19

301(a) that suit is not covered any more than a suit by an
20

individual against an employer based on a separate employment
21

contract allowed by a collective agreement is a suit within
22

Section 301.
23

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't he be able to sue on the

24

theory that the constitution is a contract between the
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

39

1

international and the local and one of the provisions in that

2

contract is for the benefit of the individual who might be

3

disciplined?

4

MR. GOLD:

He may be able to sue in a case like this.

5

In other words, individuals might be able to sue on behalf of

6

their local where they're bringing --

7
8

9
10

11

QUESTION:

No, on their own right but they're saying

that if there was a breach of a 'contractual provision between
the international and the local, it was made for his benefit.
MR. GOLD:

But the union constitution is two contracts

or two types of contracts.

Insofar as the member has a right

not to be disciplined, that's his contract with the organiza­
12
13

tion, would be a misnomer.
QUESTION:

Well, no, supposing the local and the

14

international enter into a side agreement saying, we hereby
15

agree between us that there shall be no discipline of any
16

member of our local except under the following circumstances;
17

if it's that clear?
18

MR. GOLD:

If there were a clear case of that kind

19

then the situation would be equivalent to the situation of
20

Smith v. Evening News, but if it is not that clear, the his­
21

toric understanding is thdt you have a series of contracts
22

intermixed.

And

you're

suing

on

one

and

23

sometimes on the other.

This happens to be the kind of suit

24

that is within 301, and normal — every one of the examples

GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

that Mr. Axelrod gave of member suits is the kind which we think

is basically on a contract between a member of the organization

and not under 301.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

the AFL-CIO Building here in Washington --

QUESTION:

pute between them over that contract, could that be brought in
a federal court under 301?
MR. GOLD:

Would a dis­

Unless the view of the circuits which have

said that there has to to be an effect on labor relations is
excepted, the answer to that question would be, yes.
QUESTION:

And your position is,

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

it should be yes?

16

We think that that is the view.

Let

17

me just note that in Lincoln Mills the Court said that state
18

law, if compatible with the purposes of Section 301, may be
19

resorted to in order to find the rule that

will best effectuate

the federal policy.

that kind of situa­

20

That would seem to be

tion.

Alternatively, if there is going to be an effects test,

22

we think it has to be in terms of classes of cases.
23

Certainly a no-raid agreement, a merger agreement,
24

that determines who the collective bargaining representative is,

The situation is like Harrison v. PPG.
Our second position is that if an effect is necessary,

it ought to be in terms of a class of cases and certainly what
we have here, which determines who the collective bargaining
representative is, who faces the employer, what the territorial
and trade jurisdiction is within that effects test, whether
or not the dispute is between related organizations or unrelated
organizations.
