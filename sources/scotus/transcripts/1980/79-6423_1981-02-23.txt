ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEOWEN EVANS, ESO.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER PRO HAC VICE

7

MR. EVANS-

8

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it

please the Court:
The issue before the Court today is whether

9
10

appointed counsel is a process that is due indigent parents

1 1

when the state initiates actions to terminate their narental

12

rights.

13

The State of North Carolina terminated the parental

14

rights of Abby Gail Lassiter, an indigent imprisoned mother,

15

without affording her the assistance of aopointed counsel.

16

This contested

17

the State through its authorized official, the Durham County

18

Department of Social Services, the respondent before this

19

honorable court.

20

attorneys, and by a social worker.

21

to terminate parental rights, the trial court expressly

22

stated that it relied upon the testimony before the court

23

and the record before the court.

24
25

proceeding was initiated and prosecuted by

The respondent was represented

In rendering its decision

The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed this
decision, holding that the right to family integritv is a
3

1

constitutionally protected right, that the State has invaded

2

this constitutionally protected right, but that this invasion

3

was not so serious or unreasonable as to compel the Court to

4

hold that appointed counsel was a process that was constitu­

5

tionally due the poor.

6

To the contrary, Mr. Justices, appointed counsel is

7

a process that must be due if indigent parents are to be af­

8

forded an adequate opportunity to be heard in termination

9

proceedings.

10
1 1

There is a per se need for appointed counsel

because of the inherent risk that exists otherwise.
QUESTION:

Has this Court ever gone, counsel, ever

12

gone beyond the criminal proceedings in requiring states to

13

appoint counsel in particular proceedings?

14

MR. EVANS:

No, Mr. Justice, not a purely civil

15

proceeding.

This Court hasn't gone beyond -- hasn’t appointee

16

right to appointed counsel may exist.

This Court has held

Gault is another one, isn't it?

Pardon?
Gault, the Gault case?
Yes, yes, Your Honor, in Gault.
And the State, at least , denominated

24

that a noncriminal proceeding.

25

MR. EVANS:

Yes, Mr, Justice.
4

And I -- a plurality

of the Court recognized in Vitek v. Jones the need for ap­

2

pointed counsel.
QUESTION:

Has the Court required appointed counsel

No.

The answer is, no.

reason to prevent erroneous
QUESTION:

10

terminations.

Before we leave that, Mr. Evans, Is it

11

not inherent in the rationale of the Gault and the other cases

12

that because the juvenile proceeding was so nearly a"' criminal

13

proceeding, that the criminal safeguards in various respects

14

had to be incorporated?

Isn't that the rationale?

15

MR, EVANS:

16

rationale for Gault.

17

was dealing with the transfer of a prisoner to a mental In­

18

19

right to freedom from bodily restraint being involved there.

20

That right had already been extinguished and the majority of

21

the Court recognized that there was a right to -- I'm sorry

22

-- a plurality of the Court recognized there was a need for

23

appointed counsel in those cases to protect the interests

QUESTION:

Well, now, I don't quite follow that.

You say that the Constitution protects family integrity?

8

MR. EVANS:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice.
And while you may or may not be right,

10

there's certainly nothing in the explicit words of the Con­

1 1

stitution that do protect that.

12

MR. EVANS:

13

QUESTION:

No.
But the Constitution explicitly protects

14

a person from being deprived of his property without due pro­

15

cess of law, and that's what happens in the mine-run, run-of-

16

tinguishable from the vast majority of civil cases under -QUESTION:

something explicitly protected by the Constitution.
MR. EVANS:

Well, this Court has recognized,

Mr. Justice, that the right to integrity of the family unit
6

1

is a constitutionally protected right, a Fourteenth Amendment

2

due process liberty interest.

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, but the -- and that's by judicial

decision of this Court, assuming you're correct.

5

MR. EVANS:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice.
But

the

Constitution

literally and

7

explicitly protects somebody from losing his property without

8

due process of law.

9
10
1 1
12

MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice.
So why isn't that an a fortiori case?

An ordinary run-of-the-mill civil case?
MR. EVANS:

Yes, Mr. Justice, but this case is dis­

13

tinguishable from that, Mr. Justice, on the weight of the

14

liberty interest involved.

15

QUESTION:

You think that something that this Court

16

has dreamed up is more weighty than something that's in the

17

Constitution itself?

18

MR. EVANS:

The

right

to

one's

children,

the

19

right to keep one's relationship intact with his child is more

20

fundamental than property interests.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

Well, that has to be your argument, I ex­

pect, doesn't it?
MR. EVANS:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

This Court has recog­

24

nized that the right to integrity of the family unit is far

25

more precious than property rights, comes that -- this right

Even some lower courts have recognized that the

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Evans, the Fourteenth Amendment

says that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty,

10

or property without due process of law.

11

Court is free to say that one is more important than the

12

other, when the Constitution has equated them?

13

MR. EVANS:

Do you think this

Yes, Mr. Justice, I think that this

14

Court has recognized that liberty interests are more funda­

15

mental than property interests.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. EVANS:

18

QUESTION:

19

Didn't Stanley v. Illinois say just that?
Yes, Mr. Justice.
That there was a liberty interest in

keeping the family together?

20

MR. EVANS:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. EVANS:

Yes, Mr. Justice.
Stanley said that -Right.

And Stanley said expressly that

23

the liberty interest involved there was far more precious

24

than property rights, and was more precious than those liberty

25

interests derived from shifting the economic arrangements.

Thirdly, that existing procedural safeguards will

8

be lost, and fourthly, that crucial factual disputes and

9

complex issues will go unresolved.
The case at bench is certainly illustrative of each

10
11

of these inherent risks.

12

QUESTION:

Isn’t each of those characteristics

13

present in the civil case that Mr. Justice Stewart was put­

14

ting to you?

Is that not a potential in every civil case?

MR. EVANS:

15

The -- not in every civil case, Mr.

16

Justice.

In the majority of civil cases, you have private

17

party initiating and prosecuting the action.

19

the action.

Yes, Mr. Justice, I think so.
You think so?
I think that my argument that this

On what ground would you distinguish it?

MR. EVANS

Again, the interest that is implicated.

18

In that case --

MR. EVANS

That certainly would be -- a license,

This case deals with perhaps the

1

livelihood.

He may no longer practice his profession.

3

that a rather significant interest?
MR. EVANS:

4

Isn't

Yes, Mr. Justice, and perhaps in future

5

cases this Court may weigh the factors involved and decide

6

that that should be protected.
QUESTION:

7

Well, then you do concede that if we

8

agree with you in this case, we're not going to be able to

9

contain it out of the principle to this kind of case.

We're

10

going to have to face up to it in a lot of other types of

11

cases, aren't we?
MR. EVANS: I would certainly think that the Court would

12
13

have to face up to it but the Court definitely can distinguish

14

this case from those cases.
QUESTION:

15

It would not be automatic.

Well, surely your rule would require

16

that the child be represented?

17

MR. EVANS:

Mr. Justice, certainly I think the

18

child should be represented in these cases.

not sure as to whether this Court --

MR. EVANS:

QUESTION:

5

Yes, Mr. Justice.
But your argument, I would think, would

require the appointment of a counsel for the child.
MR. EVANS:

The reason that a public counsel was

6

granted, need to be granted in these cases, is that there's

7

a constitutionally protected liberty interest that has been

8

recognized by the courts, that needs to be protected.

9

I recognize the --

11
12

QUESTION:

Now,

But that is a two-way street, the in­

tegrity of the parent-child relationship.
MR. EVANS:

Yes, but this Court has not recognized

13

as of yet, Mr. Justice, that the child has a constitutionally

14

protected right in

15

a point of distinction.

16

QUESTION:

the integrity of the family.

And that is

Mr. Evans, hasn't the State of North

17

Carolina already recognized that and passed a statute giving

18

counsel in juvenile hearings?

21

MR. EVANS:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

The State of North

Carolina does grant -QUESTION:

Well, certainly if there was a relinquish

22

ment proceeding, where the parent was going to relinquish the

23

child to the state, I would suppose your argument would be

24

that the child would have to be represented?

25

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that exactly what the statute
13

1

says on page 20?

2

the Joint Appendix?
MR. EVANS:

3
4

The new statute?

What is.

the statute in

The Joint Appendix at page 20.
Okay.

The new stat.?

The Joint

Appendix on page 20 or the brief?

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. EVANS:

The Joint Appendix.
Okay.

That statute says, Mr. Justice,

7

that in abuse and neglect and dependency cases, the right to

8

appointed counsel will be granted to indigent parents.
QUESTION:

9

So they do recognize that where you're

10

taking children from the parents, in some instances you're

1 1

entitled to counsel?

12

MR. EVANS:

13

QUESTION:

14

Yes, Mr. Justice, it does.
But what effect does that have on this

case?

15

MR. EVANS: Well, Mr. Justice, it --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. EVANS:

If any?
I think it shows that -- a basic in­

18

consistency.

19

sel for parents, indigent parents, in abuse, neglect, and

20

dependency cases in which the parental rights is faced with

21

a temporary removal, but not recognizing the same right in a

22

case in which the parental rights is faced with a total

23

severance, certainly is inconsistent.

24

25

The recognizing of the right to appointed coun­

QUESTION:
argument there?

And you're making an equal protection

This is the choice of the legislature, to
14

1

provide counsel in that situation.

2

it's going to have unequal protection, not to supply it here?
MR. EVANS:

3

Now, are you suggesting

Mr. Justice, I think that there may ever

4

be an equal protection argument.

5

The argument that we have made today is that the Due Process

6

Clause requires appointment of counsel in these cases.

QUESTION:

8

Mr. Evans?

9

to?

1 1

What is a juvenile petition?

13

MR. EVANS:

14

QUESTION:

17
18
19

20
21

22

Yes, an action that's filed in juvenile

court.
QUESTION:

16

What's that refer

A particular kind of proceeding or something?

12

15

What's the reach of this statute,

MR. EVANS:

10

We do not reach that today.

And which is not this case?
Yes, I think this -In this case?

Was this case brought by

something called juvenile petition?
MR. EVANS:

Yes, the action was filed by a juvenile,

or juvenile -QUESTION:

Well, if that's so, why doesn't this

statute apply then, as my brother Marshall suggested?
MR. EVANS:

Well, this statute was passed after

the case at bench.
QUESTION:

Well, I know but, why shouldn't we send

23

it back and ask your state courts to look at the case in

24

light of that statute?

25

MR. EVANS:

Right.

And it applies only in abuse,
15

1

neglect, and dependency, cases.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. EVANS:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. EVANS:

6

QUESTION:

This is a termination case.

Oh, I see.
And it does not apply.
So this is limited, then?
Yes, Mr. Justice.
With respect to that statute, Mr. Evans,

7

it reads, "In cases where the juvenile petition alleges that

8

a juvenile is abused, neglected, or dependent, the parent

9

has a right to counsel and to appointed counsel in cases of

10

indigency, unless the parent waives the right."

1 1

Does that suggest that even a parent who could

12

retain counsel if he were not indigent, or she were not

13

indigent, did not before the enactment of that statute have

14

the right to appear by counsel?

15

MR. EVANS:

16

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice.
I mean, at those proceedings before the

17

enactment of the statute, was anybody permitted to have an

18

attorney?

19

MR. EVANS:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

The right to retain

20

counsel was granted at those proceedings, are granted at those

21

proceedings.

22

All parties involved have a compelling reason to

You think the Constitution requires --

18

in other words, is it a necessary consequence of agreeing

19

with you that we should appoint two lawyers in every parental

20

termination case?

21

MR. EVANS:

22

QUESTION:

No, Mr. Justice.
Well, why not?

Because, why isn't the

24

to constitutional protection and be sure that there aren't

25

arguments with regard to the child's Interest that are
17

1

possibly conflicting with the parents that might be overlooked

2

in the proceeding?

3

MR. EVANS:

I think, Mr. Justice, that the right

4

should certainly be protected, but first the Court would have

5

to recognize that the child's right to integrity of the family

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS RUSSELL ODOM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ODOM:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it

please the Court:
At the outset I would like to point out to you that

18

under North Carolina law there are two different proceedings

19

by which the Department of Social Services makes an effort

20

to address family problems.

21

tory scheme provides that the Department of Social Services

22

must investigate and to:the extent necessary intervene In

23

those cases where parents can no longer be presumed to be

24

giving proper care and supervision to their children.

25

cases I will denominate custody cases which in addressing the

The statute provides, the statu­

21

Those

statute that was called into question a few minutes ago I will

2

also call abuse, neglect, and dependency proceedings.

3

It is this proceeding which represents the initial

4

intrusion into the family unit, into what Mr. Evans would call

5

the family integrity.

6

the parents are presumed, as they are entitled to, to be pro­

7

viding proper care and supervision.

8

of the Department of Social Services that they are not, and

9

the Department brings this action to court.

10

The child is still with the parents,

It comes to the attentior

Because it is the initial and most, I would argue,

11

significant intrusion into the family unit, the Legislature

12

of North Carolina has provided that both the parent and the

13

child be provided with an attorney if they cannot afford one.

14

That is the purpose of the statute, Mr. Justice Marshall,

15

that you asked about earlier.

16

Now, there is a different statutory scheme in North

17

Carolina for the termination of parental rights.

18

totally separate proceeding from the abuse, neglect, depen­

19

dency custody proceeding.

20

21

22

QUESTION:

That is a

This statute quite definitely does not

apply in that proceeding?
MR. ODOM:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.

23

At the initial custody hearing, if the court determines that

24

the child is to be removed and placed in the custody of the

25

Department of Social Services, which is what happened in this
22

1

case in May of 1975, the Department's interest tends to shift

There are provisions in the lav? that are being

There are provisions in the law now that require

10

that the custody decision that removed the child be reviewed

11

every six months to make sure that the court's mandate is

12

being followed.

13

Now, that did not happen in this case.

That statu­

14

tory provision has been enacted subsequent to this.

But what

15

happened in this case was that the family, once the child was

16

removed from the home, the family abandoned this child, in

17

foster care.

18

or twice, she had in fact visited with him once at the request

19

of the social worker,

20

And there was a period of more than a year from the time that

21

the child was in fact removed from her custody until she went

22

into prison, at which time or during which time you could pre­

MR. ODOM:

21

that the statutory scheme on balance would make their effec­

It can be construed in that fashion sub­

sequent to the effective date, but of course this all started

15

before then.

MR. ODOM:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what happened --

QUESTION:

Under the new statute, that's correct?

20

In a custody proceeding?
MR. ODOM:

21

He did under the old statute, and I'll

22

explain why.

The Department, as I pointed out, takes on the

23

role of in loco parentis, the parent role to the child, and

24

is therefore presumed to be acting in the best interest of

25

the child.

In the majority of these cases in the index to
26

1

our brief we try to point out some statistics that we were

2

able to find --that in the majority of these cases the

Department has long since exhausted all other alternatives

for reuniting the family, and that by the time they bring

It's possible, I suppose, that the

What would happen, I think, what would

create an administrative body to make a determination as to

whether or not the Department can make a decision as to whe­

15

ther the woman's rights to the child would be totally and

16

permanently severed.

17

They chose to make it, in fact, a judicial proceeding to take

18

out of the hands of the Department of Social Services the

19

right to make that determination, and they did that because

20

of the recognition of the Legislature of the importance of

21

the family right.

22

QUESTION:

But they chose not to do that.

Mr. Odom, I just want to be clear.

MR. ODOM:

Yes, it does.

It shows that she contacted the mother

and discussed with her the idea of perhaps giving the child

up for adoption or terminating her rights or asking her what

MR. ODOM:

QUESTION:

Yes, that's the question I asked you.

25

She was in jail the year before?
MR. ODOM:

Immediately preceding.

But the first

year after the child was removed from her custody, she was
36

1

not in jail, for in fact, for some 13 or 14 months after he

2

was removed and placed in a foster home, she was not in jail,

3

she was out on the street.
QUESTION:

4

But the record says she was in jail.

5

At that time, you said, she didn't see him for the first

6

year.

For the last year she only saw him twice.
MR. ODOM:

7

What the transcript shows is that she

8

hadn't seen him at all since he had been removed, but two

9

or three times,

10

those occurring when, in fact, she was out

on the street.

11

QUESTION:

Well, I'll take a look at it and give

12

you the benefit of the doubt.

13

MR. ODOM:

In fact, though, the petition was brought

14

on two grounds and the court concluded as a matter of law

15

that she had failed to maintain concern or responsibility as

16

to the child's welfare.

17

the fact that a parent is in prison does not prevent them

18

from maintaining concern or responsibility as to the child's

19

welfare.

20

wouldn't argue that it would have prevented a finding that

21

she had willfully abandoned him, and that was not alleged

22

in this case.

23

And I would submit to the court that

And she had made no effort to do that.

Now, I

I think, in trying to sum up, the obverse of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN MANSFIELD SHABER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF NORTH CAROLINA AS AMICUS CURIAE

17
18

Mr.

MR.

SHABER

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Perhaps I might begin, Justice Rehnquist, by fol­

20

lowing up on your question about whether or not the state

21

could dispense with counsel altogether in these hearings.

22

frankly, sir, I think not, notwithstanding Parham v. J.R.

23

And the reason I think not is that the degree of importance

24

that's attached to the family relationship in Stanley v.

25

Illinois and the other child custody cases Is such that the
38

Anc

1

Court would not be able to hold that counsel could be barred

2

from the hearings.
Justice Brennan, you asked if counsel that are

appointed in neglect cases carry over?

5

in practice they sometimes do.

6

the state that they necessarily are entitled to carry over,

7

although that is the practice of many state district court

Mr. Odom says that

It is not the position of

The question simply has not been addressed in North

QUESTION:

Has there been any effort to have the

11

Legislature address it?

12

between the custody and the termination procedures?

13

MR. SHABER:

I just wonder, why the distinction

Your Honor, I can suggest a couple of

14

possible distinctions. I should say more than possible; I

15

think they are the distinctions.

16

First is this, that the intrusion at the time of

17

the neglect hearing is really the more important intrusion

18

because that's what separates a child from the parent and dis­

19

rupts the care and companionship of the child.

20

really sunders the family, and from that point on

21

parent has is not an interest in the companionship of the

22

child but the expectation that with the help of the state the

23

child may come back some time in the future.

24

is a much lower interest.

25

That's what
what the

That interest

The second point is this, that the County Department
39

1

of Social Services being charged with this obligation to try

2

and restore the family, and having this obligation not only

3

from the time of the neglect hearing on, but prior to the

4

neglect hearing, finds itself in sort of a conflict of inter­

5

est situation. It's supposed to protect the child on one

6

hand and on the other hand it's supposed to try and put the

7

family back together.

8

ment of Social Services out of trouble

9

And one way to keep the County Depart­
given this inherent

10

for the child and an attorney for the parent, and that's

1 1

what the state does.

12
13
14
15
16

The third point, I think, is that very often,
although not always, the neglect -- sir?
QUESTION:

May I just interrupt?

Why isn't the

same conflict present at the termination hearing?
MR. SHABER:

By the time the termination hearing

17

comes along, Justice Stevens, the County Department of Social

18

Services has made a decision that the child cannot go home

19

and should not go home.

it no longer has --

24

QUESTION:

25

It no longer has an obligation to
It is exclusively concerned

And so it's not divided;

It's kind of ironic, because at the first

hearing it has a greater interest in the parent's side of the

potential controversy and yet the parent has an independent

right to counsel.

do so effectively.

5

At the second hearing nobody speaks for

MR. SHABER:

Yes, sir, Your Honor, I concede the

6

irony in that, and I would nevertheless suggest that the rea­

7

son is that by the time you get to the termination action,

8

the state's interest is really not readily distinguishable

9

from the interest of any other private person who under the

10

termination statute might also have had standing to bring a

1 1

termination of parental rights action.
