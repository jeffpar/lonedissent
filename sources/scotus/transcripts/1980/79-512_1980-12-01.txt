ORAL ARGUMENT OF GRAYDON S. STARING, ESQ.,

MR. STARING:

'

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

■ , > -

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents to the Court one of the four prin­

10

cipal purposes for which the 1972 amendments to the Longshore­

1 1

men's Act were made,

12

and that purpose, as the report stated it, was to provide a

13

special cause of action for damages against third parties.

according to the Senate committee report,

14

The court below, and the respondent here

15

QUESTION:

16

17

Well, another purpose was to get rid of a

Sieracki-type cause of action, wasn't it?
MR. STARING:

Yes, Your Honor, it was.

I was simply

18

quoting from the four stated purposes, stated principal pur­

19

poses in the Senate report, and I think that probably that pur­

20
21

22
23
24

25

pose of getting rid of Sieracki was subsumed in that statement
in this purpose, to provide a new or specified cause of action.
I quite agree that that was the intent.

Very much a part of it,

The court below, and the respondent here in defin­
ing that specified cause of action would, we submit, impose
upon the vessel a responsibility for longshoremen's injury
3

1

which is without counterpart in any significant body of law,

2

and let me explain it.

3

First, I'd like to remind the Court of the relations

4

involved.

5

not an employee of the shipowner, and thus the shipowner was

6

not by virtue

7

of care which employers traditionally have toward their direct

8

employees.

9

ployee of an expert independent stevedoring company.

The longshoreman here, as in most such cases, was

of that relationship under those special duties

The longshoreman was, instead, as usual, an em­
This

10

Court in Italia, some years ago, noted that such companies

11

are usually in the best position to enforce safety for their

12

employees.

13

practical control of the area that's been turned over to him,

14

is in control of the operations he's conducting there, and of .

15

the men who are doing it.

16

This is because the stevedore contractor is in

But more than that, the stevedore contractor here

17

as in other cases has imposed upon him by positive law under

18

Section 41 of the Longshoremen's Act and the numerous regula­

19

tions which are issued by the Department of Labor, a primary

20

and very positive duty of care for the safety of his employees

21

in the work.

22
23
24

25

And before we get farther into this case, let

me point to the specific regulation which bears most sharply
on this case.
There is, or was at the time of this case, as there
still is, a regulation issued by the Department of Labor under
4

1

the Longshoremen's Act, that any defect or malfunction of a

2

winch be reported immediately to the officer in charge, of the

3

vessel.

4

says that in the case of an electrical winch, when the electro­

5

magnetic or other service brake is unable to hold the load, as

6

is alleged in this case, the winch shall not be used.

7

thus the stevedore contractor was confronted with positive law

8

commanding him to report immediately and not to use the winch

9

if that defect manifested itself.

10

But what is much more, the regulation goes on and

And

Against that background, then, we ask what was the

1 1

duty of the vessel owner?

12

says that the essential question is not one of duty but whether1

13

his "interests are entitled to be protected against the defen­

14

dant's conduct," and to that we ask rhetorically, what conduct.?

15

Because there is a great deal of difference, in this field be­

16

tween conduct and --

17

24

QUESTION:

The respondent here in his brief

Isn't even simple negligence traditionally

outlined in terms of duty and breach of duty owed to a parti­
cular person or group of persons?
MR.

STARING:

I think that is -- yes, I do think that

is very common, and I think that in any ordinary negligence
case one must first find the duty based upon some status or
relationship which imposes upon the defendant an obligation
to look out for another.

Now, in some instances, the status

or relationship is simply proximity, such as my proximity to
25

5

1

another man which puts me in a position to hurt him.

MR. STARING:

Yes.

That's not maritime law7, though.
I beg pardon?

That's not exactly maritime law.
That has not been the traditional

That's true of maritime law or land-based

MR. STARING:

a duty can exist; yes.

MR. STARING:

Yes.

MR. STARING:

A duty not to conduct ours elves' in a

way which carelessly or recklessly endangers those about us;
yes.

I quite agree with that.
QUESTION:

For example, if you stumble on a piece of

23

grease on the sta.irw?ay going, up to your office,' you don't
24

recover the same way as you do if you stumble on a piece of
25

grease on the Queen Mary.

Is that right.
6

1

MR. STARING:

2

QUESTION:

I believe that's right, Your Honor.

Mr.

Staring, what in your view, what was

3

the duty of the vessel owner with regard to the condition of

4

the winch?

5

what was it?

Did he have any duty to the longshoreman and if so.

MR.

6

STARING:

If the condition of the winch -- in the:

7

circumstances of this case, I do not think that the vesssel

8

owner had any duty to the longshoreman with respect to the con-’

9

dition of the winch.
QUESTION:

10
11

12

gerous, he knew that people would be working with it.
MR. STARING:
QUESTION:

14

18

19

Ah, now --

And I'm saying, what the duty is, not

what the facts show.
MR.

16
17

No duty whatsoever, even if the winch

were defective, he knew it was defective, he knew it was dan­

13

15

I would --

STARING:

All right.

The vessel owner has no

duty, I submit, with respect to the condition of the winch un­
less he was in a position of superior knowledge or superior
means of preventing harm.
QUESTION:

Not merely

knowledge but superior know­

20

21

ledge?
MR. STARING:

Superior knowledge.

If, therefore, he

22

was as -23

QUESTION:

whom?

24

MR.

STARING:

Superior to the stevedore company.

3

thing about it?

4

MR. STARING:

If

Is there any duty to do any­

I think he has none.

I think that in

5

that situation I would pose the question whether the shipowner

6

cannot reasonably hire a stevedore who is subject to the legal

7

mandate that I've described and look to the stevedore to see

8

that his longshoremen are not subjected to the danger.

9

QUESTION:

Well, what is the purpose of the Secretary

10

of Labor's requirement that defects in the: winch be reported

11

to the vessel owner?

12

13

Why do they have that requirement, then?

MR. STARING:

then make repairs if repairs should be made.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STARING:

16

he has an opportunity.

Then he has the duty to repair, right?

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. STARING:

In order that the vessel owner can

Well, he doesn't have a duty as such,
He has an opportunity to repair.

No duty?
Since the stevedore, if he has obeyed

stopped work, it's a question whether

Maybe the stevedore hasn't.

Maybe the

stevedore says, the winch seems to be acting up a little bit.
I don't know much about this particular winch, but it looks
fishy to me.

And what does the vessel owner have to do then?

MR. STARING:

The vessel owner then has, I would say.

25

8

1

an opportunity to repair it and certainly --

2
3

QUESTION:

MR. STARING:
a duty.

I agree.

He has

Well, but if you say he has a duty, then

you've got Sieracki right back.
MR. STARING:

8
9

I beg -- Your Honor.

In certain circumstances -QUESTION:

6
7

Does

he have any duty?

4

5

No, but I want to ask about duty.

No, I don't believe so.

I believe

that he has a duty, then, to look into the condition of the

10

winch and exercise due care with respect to whether it is

11

operating properly before the stevedore goes forward and works

12

with it further.

13

under Sieracki

16

MR. STARING:

23
24

No.

Your Honor, is Your Honor using

the term stevedore here to mean the longshoreman?
QUESTION:

The longshoreman.

MR. STARING:

20

22

Do you say that -- do you concede that

the stevedore can recover from the shipowner?

19

21

What if the shipowner and the employee

had equal knowledge?

17

18

to see if that winch is free of defect.

QUESTION:

14

15

But he does not have an absolute duty as

If the knowledge is equal, then we do

not concede that a recovery can be had from the vessel.

Let

me -QUESTION:

Let's suppose, when the job starts, they

hire the stevedore and the shipowner says , by the way, this
winch is acting up a little, but I think if you're really

25

9

1

careful with it, it'll be all right.

2

well, I'll watch it.

3

Now, all the shipowner's done is to point out a piece of de­

4

fective machinery and the stevedore says, well, we'll go ahead

5

anyway, in effect.

6

HR.

And the stevedore says,

And it does what it did in this case.

He goes ahead and somebody gets hurt.

STARING:

What has happened, Your Honor, in

7

that case, is that the vessel owner has pointed out a report

8

of, let us say, a winch that operates less than perfectly.

9

I don't know whether that's a defect or not, but it doesn't —

10

maybe not be operating perfectly.

11

an expert in this field and in the matter of safety for his

12

employees in this field, is then asked to consider whether it

13

is or is not a safe operating winch.

14

we submit, to make that determination.

15

QUESTION:

And the stevedore, who is

And he may be looked to,
And if he thinks --

So you -- the short answer is that the

16

extent of bis duty is to make known any unsafe things that are

17

known to him, the shipowner, that is?

18

MR.

19

QUESTION:

20

21
22
23
24

25

STARING:

Yes, Your Honor.

And that be has no affirmative duty to

repair the winch?
MR. STARING:

He has no affirmative duty in that

circumstance to repair the winch for the benefit of the steve­
dore and the longshoreman.
QUESTION:

Or for the benefit of the longshoreman?

MR. STARING:

That's right.
10

1

2

QUESTION:

Now, Mr, Staring,

where is it in the

statute you said supports this interpretation?

3

MR. STARING:

The statute that I point to is not in

4

the amendments, Your

5

shoremen's Act, which has been there somewhat more years than

6

the 1972 amendments.

7

QUESTION:

Honor, but is Section 41 of the Long­

This being the duties you read us.

8

I thought you said those were regulations of the Secretary of

9

Labor?
MR. STARING:

10

Your Honor, the statute is the general

11

direction and the authority for the regulations , and then

12

regulations have been issued under that statute, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

13

And we don't find this in the. '72 amend­

14

ments, we find it in these regulations issued under the older .

15

statute?
MR. STARING:

16

That's right, Your Honor.

The respon­

17

dent, here, of course, says no to the: question whether the

18

vessel owner may look to the stevedore in the circumstances

19

which we have just been discussing;

20

pose on the vessel a novel responsibility, one which if accept­

21

ed would be peculiar to the maritime law. And so it would be

22

contrary to the legislative history that counsels us that

23
24

25

and we say, seeks to im­

under Section 5 of the Act, as amended, landbased law is to be
applied, and we are to reject -- and

And I submit that in the context of the maritime

1 1

industry, and the Longshoremen's Act, what Congress meant here

12

when they rejected the nondelegable duty was to insure that a

13

shipowner hereafter would have the capacity to contract work

14

out free of a retained duty to oversee that work, to protect

15

workmen involved from the consequences of the work.

16

vided, of course, that the shipowner has truly delegated the

17

work, turned over the control of it, which of course means

18

that he must have disclosed what he: had superior knowledge of

19

or made available the superior means which he might have had.

20
21

22
23
24

25

Now, pro­

Because if he has not done that, he has not fully delegated.
But surely Congress intended, if nondelegable duty means any­
thing, that the shipowner was in the future to be in the posi­
tion of contracting work out with those consequences ~QUESTION:

So in my example to you you would say, is

that the stevedore, if he didn't like it, he didn't want to
12

1

work with it, if his judgment was that the winch was unsafe or

2

that he didn't want, to take the risk, that he would just not

3

work.

He'd say, either fix it or get another stevedore.

4

MR.

STARING:

Oh, he would say, fix it, and he would

5

go on standby and collect his charges for doing nothing until

6

you have.

7

And -- or until you've got another stevedore.
QUESTION:

Do you think that's what the restatement

8

standard means?

9

landbased restatement standard, duty of the: landowner.

I did not handle the case in the Court

QUESTION:

But was it urged?

MR. STARING:

At this --

it was urged in the Court

of Appeals.
QUESTION:

And do you agree that it's --

MR. STARING:
dard to apply.

I agree that that would be a good stan­

But may I say, Your Honor, that --

QUESTION:

Well, I'm wondering, because the last

part of that standard says, with regard to the landowner, "He
should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm

23

and fails to exercise reasonable care to protect the invitees
24

against the danger."

Now, you say all he has to do to protect

25

13

1

the invitees against the danger is to tell them about it.

MR. STARING:

QUESTION:

Your Honor, if he should, in many in­

Well, in this case, for example, all he

would have to do is tell them about the -MR. STARING:

If he had known about it in advance.

But in this case, Your Honor -QUESTION:

A fortiori, in this case, if he didn't

know about it in advance but suppose the stevedore told him

10

that, gee, you've got a defective crane here, and he just

11

shrugged his shoulders.

12

MR. STARING:

It's the same thing.
In this case, Your Honor, the stevedore

13

knows it and is asserted to have known it throughout the rec­

14

ord and did not stop work,

15

and it would do no good to tell him.

16

the judge below had no record to indicate that the vessel knew

17

this in advance of the stevedore, and it didn't matter, because

18

the stevedore knew it well in advance of the accident.

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

as he was commanded by law to do, .
We have no record, and

Mr. Staring, incidentally, on the issue of

superior knowledge, does the shipowner before he turns ships'
equipment over to a stevedoring company, have, any duty of in­
spection of the equipment, to find out if there is anything
wrong with it?
MR. STARING:

None has been established by law,

none is shown in the record of this case.
14

There is no general

1

legal duty of inspecting the premises, inspecting the equip­

2

ments other than what is imposed by Coast Guard and other

3

applicable regulations.

4

QUESTION:

But they do not enter the record here

Unless he happens to stumble on knowledge

5

of the defect, he has nothing in the way of a duty to say a

6

word to the stevedore about it?

7

Does he?

MR. STARING: That is generally correct.

He has no

8

way to do this, but he engages the stevedore as was cited in

9

the Hugev case as an expert in the field who knows that he

10

meets vessels that come in in all kinds of conditions and for

1 1

all sorts -- because of all sorts of stresses , and may encoun­

12

ter many of these things as familiar conditions.

13

I'd like to dilate a little bit more, on this dis­

14

tinction between latent and obvious or known defects which you.

15

are focusing on.

16

tention here that the doctrine of assumption of risk is some­

17

how involved.

18

distinction between latency and knowledge or obviousness.

19

This Court, years after it had disposed of the question of as­

20

sumption of risk in the maritime lav;, has continued tc recog­

21

22
23
24

25

This is very much at the heart of the con­

The key to the question is the validity of the

nize in its jurisprudence the distinction between latency and
knowledge and the significance of those facts.
In Weyerhaeuser v. Nacirema in 1958, the Court noted
the significance of latency as giving rise to a need to warn,
and by implication in contrast, to a known, obvious condition.
15

1

The following year, 1959, in West v. United States,

2

this Court observed the same distinction again.

3

Court decided Federal Marine Terminals v. Burnside, and in that

4

case quoted in full the portions from the Hugev case in the

5

9th Circuit and the Mickle case, which we have relied on and

6

quoted in our briefs -- quoted them, I venture to say, with at

7

least a modicum of approval.

8

tations were explicit on the distinction between latency and

9

knowledge obviousness.

In 1969, this

And those sections of those quo­

This case: quoted the:m in close conjunction with Cita­

10
11

tion and quotation, and indeed application of its Kermarec

12

case, which has also been urged here by the respondent, and

13

incorrectly, we think, as a reason why our formulation cannot

14

be applied.
Let me come back for’ a moment tc a question that

15
16

Mr. Justice White focused on which concerned the 343 and

17

343(a).

18

they have been embraced somewhere and rejected somewhere.

19

When the state court cases which form the body of law from

20

21
22
23
24

25

We do not embrace 343 and 343(a), precisely because

which these rules must be drawn are examined, we find, of
course, that some of them deal with real property, some of
them deal with other matters.

The restatement synthesizes

them and formulates their rules, and if we choose to use the
restatement, as a number of courts below have done, we still
have choices within the restatement.
16

But the result doesn't

1

make much difference, or any at all.

Whether you choose from

2

the restatement those sections which have to do with real pro­
3

perty and analogize the vessel tc re:al property, or choose
4

sections which relate to chattels, since the vessel is in law
5

and in fact a chattel, the result comes out the same way, be­
6

cause the principle is the same, and it's expressed in both
7

sections, that the vessel is only liable in those case.

The

8

occupier, the furnisher of the chattel, the vessel is only
9

liable on the basis of superior knowledge, means, and control.
10

QUESTION:

May I ask, when you say "superior know­

11

ledge," superior to whom, to the stevedore or the longshoreman'’
12

MR. STARING:

Superior to the stevedore.

QUESTION:

Because the restatement talks about the

14

invitee who's injured.

Mr. Justice Stevens, it seems to us that if you are going to

I'm sure it's possible if they'd enter

I say that the

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. GRUTZ:

10

Mr. Staring, you have

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
My name is James Grutz.

1 1

I represent the respondent,

12

Lauro De Los Santos, individual longshoreman, who was injured

13

in the way that is described in the statement of facts in the

14

brief.
I would like to start with what I believe the .

15
16

amendments, 1972 amendments, did in this case, or as they

17

apply to this case.

18

there was negligence and that negligence of a shipowner injured

19

a longshoreman, that he had a suit for negligence against the

First of all, the amendments said that if

shipowner.
Secondly, it did away with any indemnity actions by
the shipowner against the stevedoring company for the breach
of the warranty of workmanlike service.

That's: the Ryan' case.

And thirdly, it did away with the doctrine of,unseaworthiness.
There is no mention in the statute about standards involving

landbased duties.
invitees.

There is no mention in the statute about

There is no mention in the statute about indepen­

3

dent contractors, and so forth.

4

that negligence actions are permitted by longshoremen who are

5

injured against shipowners.

6

QUESTION:

There is simply the statement

Well, Mr. Grutz, if we apply landbased

7

principles of negligence in this area as set out in the re­

8

statement or in some other treatise or some other line of

9

cases, do you lose this case?

10

MR. GRUTZ:

Landbased, Your Honor, is not a term of

11

art.

12

within the law of invitees, the premises liability areas of

13

landbased law probably -- there are 50 different tests within

14

the United States.

15

subtests within each of those tests within the United States.

16

So, I don't know what landbased means, Your Honor.

17

It can mean probably 15G different things.

QUESTION:

For instance,

There are probably three or four different-

So you say, Congress has in effect given

18

us no guidance and we've simply got to choose from among the

19

various courts of appeals, or --

20

MR. GRUTZ:

No, I think Congress has given us some,

21

guides, Your Honor.

22

the statute is clear, and unambiguous.

25

I think the Congress intended and I think

It preserves the maritime negligence action which existed
prior to the amendments.

MR. GRUTZ:

It doesn't say what it is but I think

that it's -QUESTION:
MR. GRUTZ:

That's the argument.
That's correct.

It doesn't say what it

was aware of the negligence cases which existed prior to the

9

amendments, and that they are said then to have adopted what

the courts had said about what those duties were.
QUESTION:

Is there anything at al]

in the legisla­

Yes, Your Honor, there is.

Now, I would

take the position that the statute is clear and the legisla­

MR. GRUTZ:

That was just a refusal to overrule

Sieracki did not do away with the negligence action.
QUESTION:

5

No, except most of the cases are seawor­

MR. GRUTZ:

QUESTION:

10
1 1

Much easier to prove?

That's correct.

So you could always go with unseaworthi­

ness, if you were a plaintiff's lawyer.
MR. GRUTZ:

12

That's correct.

And so, most of the

13

cases that come up are in that vein: that is correct.

14

think that -QUESTION:

15

But I

Well, what I was asking, Mr. Grutz, is

16

there anything in the; legislative history that addresses it­

shoreman?

19

20

21

MR. GRUTZ:
QUESTION:
MR. GRUTZ:

Absolutely, Your Honor.
Well, what does it ssty?
It says that the shipowner owes a duty

of due care under the circumstances tc maintain a safe place to
work and to correct dangerous conditions aboard the vessel.

GRUTZ:

QUESTION:

7

MR. GRUTZ;

Is it a Joint House-Senate report?
Yes, yes.

The language is exactly the

But it's not in the statute?
It is not in the statute.

The language

8

in the Senate report -- and it's identical ir the House report

9

-- is that nothing --- "Thus, nothing in this bill is intended

10

to derogate from the vessel's responsibility to take appro­

1 1

priate corrective action where it knows or should have known

12

about a dangerous condition."

13

QUESTION:

14

Well, what's the previous sentence mean,

Mr. Grutz?

15

MR.

GRUTZ:

16

QUESTION:

And the one before that -"Will still be required to exercise the

17

same care as landbased person in providing a safe place to

18

work."
MR. GRUTZ:

19

All right.

I think it means that the

20

shipowner has an obligation to exercise reasonable care to

21

make sure that the working place is safe.

22

guage is used -- it's in several instances in the legislative

23
24

history.

The landbased lan­

And I would submit, Your Honor, that the landbased

language is not used as a term of art, it is used as a
descriptive term which differentiates it from the Sieracki
26

1

unseaworthiness cases which are being done away with by the

2

amendments to the Act.

3

QUESTION:

Weil, what would be the difference if the

4

shipowner has an obligation tc provide a safe place to work

5

and Sieracki is done away with?

6

MR. GRUTZ:

Well, the difference is, Your Honor,

7

notice.

8

negligence case is basically notice.

9

reading of the committee report points out the difference, and

The difference between a seaworthiness case and a
Ynd I think that a full

10

I think this Court in cases has recognized the difference.

1 1

In Gutierrez there's a discussion of the difference between

12

negligence and unseaworthiness.

13

negligent must be put on notice or halve an opportunity to know 5

14

either actual or constructive notice, of the the danger.

15

Otherwise, he cannot be said to have the duty.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. GRUTZ:

18

QUESTION:

19

20
21

In one case the actor’ to be

And to whom must the notice run?

To the

To the shipowner.
Well, on the other side, to the stevedore

employer or to the actual longshoreman?
MR. GRUTZ:

Oh. the notice as regards contributory

negligence or comparative negligence?

22

QUESTION:

Well, the notice of the unsafe condition.

23

MR. GRUTZ:

It is my position that the notice would

24

have to run to the individual longshoreman, because he's the

25

one -- for instance, in this case -- that the district court
27

1

said, knew and appreciated this particular risk, and sub­

2

jected himself to it.

3

on a motion fcr summary judgment barred the plaintiff from any

4

recovery or from even going to the jury on the basis, simply,

5

of was there an open and obvious danger?

6
7

8
9

10

QUESTION:

So that he barred the district court

Well, if the plaintiff knew there was an

open and obvious danger, why shouldn't he haive been barred?
MR. GRUTZ:

As a matter of law, Your Honor, he can­

not be barred because the open and obvious danger becomes
assumption of the risk.

1 1

QUESTION: Well, it could just as well be a fellow

12

servant or a failure to submit sufficient proof tC' the dis­

13

trict court.

14

MR. GRUTZ:

Your Honor, it seems to me that if there

15

is evidence put on that there was negligence, that there was a

16

failure to remedy

17

the ship, and the shipowner reserved the right by regulation

18

and by practice to repair1 that winch, that to simply say that

19

if a longshoreman recognized some danger, an individual

20

longshoreman recognized some danger, that he as a matter of

21

law cannot recover, is simply tc say that he then knows and

22

appreciates a risk, accepts the risk, and then we're: into the

23
24

25

the winch, which was an integral part of

assumption of risk argument, which Congress in the legislative
reports has proscribed.
QUESTION:

Well, I must say, Mr. Grutz, that at page28

1

2

1-10:

"Nothing in this bill is intended tc derogate from the

vessel's responsibility tc take appropriate corrective action

3

where it knows or should have known about a dangerous condi­

4

tion" seems to be contrary to the argument of your colleague,

5

that all they have to do is, if he knows about something, tell

6

the stevedore about it?

That's the difference between unseaworthi-

That language that my brother Brennan has

responsibility to do it.
MR. GRUTZ:

16

And the oil spil] example

re.ad says nothing of liability to anybody else..

11

13

Absolutely.

MR. GRUTZ:

all to a joint congressional com­

I think Congress did net put it in the

statute because they assumed that negligence had a meaning,
29

1

that the significant meaning of negligence -- tha+ there had

2

been a negligence action preserved in the Longshoremen

3

Harbor Workers' Act ever since its inception -- and that it

4

had a meaning which they were willing to acce^pt.

5

QUESTION:

and

Well, I don't know why you don't rely on

6

what they said on 1-11: "Under this standard" -- that is, the

7

negligence standard -- "as adopted by the committee, there will

8

of course be disputes as to whether the vessel was negligent

9

in a particular case.

Such issues can only be resolved through

10

the application of accepted principles of tort law and of the

11

ordinary process of litigation, just as they are in cases

12

involving alleged negligence by landbased third parties."

13

MR. GRUTZ:

I think that they're saying that to re­

14

solve these questions, there are going tc be: trials, there are

15

going to be cases submitted to factfinders to decide whether

16

there was the failure to operate with ordinary care.

17

QUESTION:

Well, it sounds like the Committee at

18

least thought that under ordinary

longshoreman would recover on this oil spill matter.

20

MR. GRUTZ:

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
They may have been wrong about what they

thought landbased law was.

23

MR. GRUTZ:

24

QUESTION:

Or thought it was.

MR. GRUTZ:

That's correct.

25

That's right.

30

I think --

There's no doubt that

1

they are indicating their belief that Sieracki -- they take

2

two oil spill examples and juxtapose them.

3

they say there is no notice but under Sieracki the longshore­

4

man could recover.

is the negligence action.

he can recover.

The second one, they describe, as

And so they believe -- yes -- that

And earlier in the discussions they advocate

So that

10

Mr. Staring's approach would be that if the danger is open and

11

obvious enough, that a longshoreman walking up the gangplank

12

could or should have seen grease on the. deck or you-na.me.-it,

13

the winch is rusty, there is a hole in the: deck, and so on and

14

so forth, or there's a sign saying, here are all the defi­

15

ciencies of this vessel, that at that point they're immunized.

16

Now, that is not consistent

MR. GRUTZ:

Absolutely.

It was there long enough --

so that in terms of reasonable care, the owner of the estab­
lishment could have discovered the situation.
QUESTION:

Well, then that's certa.inly a rejection

of the landowner-invitee landbased test.
MR. GRUTZ:

There's no question in my mind, Your

Honor, that the landowner-invitee test is absolutely
25

34

1

inconsistent and incompatible with the amendments to the

2

statute.

There's absolutely no question about it.

That's correct, and I think they're

wrong.

7

adopting 343 and 343 (a) but there is a lot of cautioning going or

QUESTION:

Well, that's just the way the cookie

crumbles under the statute, maybe.
MR. GRUTZ:

The statute does not talk about invitees

landbased law, independent contractor, et cetera.
about maintaining the negligence action.

It talks

The legislative his­

tory talks about retaining the negligence action.

And the

retention of the negligence standard, I would submil, means
that if the shipowner has failed to exercise reasonable care
to fix something -- in other words, there is a duty to do

23

something about it, it isn't simply to warn, it isn't simply
24

to say, you should have seen it, therefore it's your problem.

MR. GRUTZ:

It's been suggested in some of these

simply a descriptive term which differentiates the former sea­

years, I had a number of them.

MR.

GRUTZ:

I think t:ha+ the state courts are all

tending toward the duty of a person, of a landowner, to exer­

7

cise reasonable care under the circumstances, which is exactly

8

the standard of care which the 9th Circuit adopted in this

case.

So that the tendency is that direction, Your Honor,

10

even though there are remnants of the old, of the feudal idea

11

that the landowner is king on his premises and nobody shall

12

tread there, and he's in a. special status.

There's no question about

9

10
1 1

QUESTION:

Did you yourself advance the theory that

the 9th Circuit adopted.
MR. GRUTZ:

Absolutely.

At

the

'9th

Circuit

it

12

was asked., well what about all of these opinions?

13

of the opinions were the other direction at that time, and T

14

stated that I believed that they were in left field and that

15

they simply were wrong.

16

in its use of assumption of risk and contributory negligence

17

with what Congress was ssiying here.

18

in the reports that assumption of the; risk has no place in

20

25

Because most

You cannot reconcile 343 and 343(a)

Congress said very clearly

these cases and that contributory negligence has no place an
these cases, and yet the district court in this case as a
matter of law said that once Mr. Santos saw some danger, he
was forever foreclosed from going any further.
QUESTICN:

Under this standard is summary judgment

really ever possible?
MR. GRUTZ:

Under the standard of the; 9th Circuit?
39

Oh,

1

yes,

certainly

there

is,

if

there

is

2

-- in other words, if a motion for summatry judgment is brought

3

as a respondent I would have the obligation of putting on some

4

evidence that there was some notice to the shipowner of a

5

defect.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Grutz, it's agreed in this case, as I

7

understand if., that the stevedore had control of the workplace

8

Is that correct?
MR. GRUTZ:

9

No.

It isn't, Your Honor.

The Joint

10

Appendix in, I think it's paragraph 7, page 11, the pretrial

1 1

states that the -- I think it says control of the: workplace.
QUESTION:

12

It says, "and particularly the foreman,

That's correct.

They were in

They were in control, but they were allowed -- pardon?
QUESTION:

Is it clear that they were not in control

of the: winch?
MR.

GRUTZ:

Yes.

I think the regulation that I have

cited in my brief indicates that in the: case of a malfunction­
23

ing electrical winch, the stevedore company has absolutely no
24

right to touch or try to repair that winch.
25

40

So the only

1

person or entity that has the power to remedy what we advocate

2

is going wrong on the ship at the time of this injury is the

3

shipowner.

4

5

QUESTION:

the analogy of a storeowner would be incomplete, would it not?

6
7

MR. GRUTZ:

The analogy of what, Your Honor? I'm

sorry.
QUESTION:

8
9

As to whatever the stevedore had control,

You discussed at one point a little

earlier in the argument the possible analogy of a landbased

10

store owner for, say, a grease spot on the floor, but in this

1 1

case, to the extent that the stevedore company control]ed

12

the workplace, that would be different from a store, where the

13

storeowner himself controlled the: workplace.

That's correct.

That's correct.

Thait' s correct.
So, what's -- shouldn't it also be open

to question as to whether the stevedore has the

duty, as soon

as reasonably possible, to notify a shipowner about a. defec­
tive winch?

Why should it be left to, "should have known"?

Couldn't the stevedore have tcld him, as soon as he knew the;
winch was defective?
MR. GRUTZ:

He knew it for 2-1/2 days.

evidence that he did tel] him, but it's an inference, I suppose..

Why visit that responsibility on the

Injured longshoreman.
Even though the longshoreman is covered

that, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I'm still nuzzled.

I hate to reveal my

The evidence, again, is -- this was sum­

25

Very well.

Mr. Staring.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
MR. STARING:

May it please the Court:

There was discussion here as tc whether the passage
of time should be taken as charging the vessel, passage of
time alone should be taken as charging the vessel with notice
of a defect.

That was exactly the problem in the Albanese

case which we cited in our brief, where the trial court chargee
the jury that if it determined the condition had existed long
45

1

enough, to charge the shipowner with notice of it; they could

2

hold the shipowner.

3

said, that was erroneous.

4

judgment of the Court of Appeals was erroneous, and therefore

5

set it aside, citing as the single case of Gutierrez v. Water­

6

man Steamship, which was aptly cited for the purpose..

7

one of the cases which was cited as in the legislative history

8

as one which -- it was not supposed tc happen again, in prin­

9

ciple at least.

10

The Court of Appeals for1 the 2nd Circuit
This Court said, we believe the

This was

Now, the Gutierrez case, which had been cited here

1 1

as authority for the Albanese case, was a case which itself

12

explicitly rested upon nondelegable duty.

13

said, as a basis for its decision, the shipowner had an abso­

14

lute and nondelegable duty of care toward petitioner.and not

15

to create this risk for him.

16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

Well-,- this Court

And you were dealing with negligence at that time.
There are, however, other negligence cases, not so many for
the reason that Hr. Justice Stewart and others pointed out,
but there are other negligence cases before 19 72 , which we have:
cited in the brief and which we submit are harmonious with the
formulation of duty which the restatement would lay down and
which we have adopted here.
QUESTION:

Hay I just interrupt you right, there?

As I understood your opening argument, you did not buy 100
percent the restatement's formulation of the standard of duty.

25

46

1

MR. STARING:

2

QUESTION:

No.

I said, we don't have to buy it.

You don't have to?

Well, is there any­

3

thing in the written materials that tells us precisely what

4

your position is?

5

6

MR. STARING:

We have.

stated -QUESTION:

7

8

Yes, indeed, Your Honor.

Because I sort of had

the ' view

you

were adopting the restatement position.
MR. STARING:

9

No.

We have stated it separately, and

10

not in restatement terms, and

we feel it

can be reconciled

1 1

or can be supported by the restatement, by any of a number of

12

other sources.
The oil spill was discussed and I'd like to point

13
14

out that as we read the oil

15

the difference between unseaworthiness before and negligence

16

after.

17

in negligence notice is necessary, but it doesn't mean that

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

spill illustration, it illustrates,

And where it refers to notice, what it means is that

notice is always sufficient.

There are instances, of course,

in which the vessel owner would be held for the oil spill, and
instances in which he wouldn't.

It depends on whether the

spill is obvious or not, whether it's in am area that's under
the control of the stevedore, whether’ it was created by the
vessel's personnel, when it was created, and so on.

If it's

an oil spill in an area over which the vessel has retained
essential control but which longshoremen have to pass through,

47

1

that presents an entirely different situation and one which

2

arises in the course of work.

3

far' as oi] spills are concerned.
Finally,

4

it

was

So, there's no pat result so

suggested --- it's been suggested

5

that there was a big difference, here, whsither -- as to what

6

rule you might apply to the stevedore and to the longshoreman

7

himself.

8

by this Court in Federal Marine Terminals v. Burnside, if

9

Kermarec does mean anything in these circumstances in abolish-

And I'd like to suggest that, as was explicitly said

10

ing the distinction between licensees and invitees and other

1 1

irrational distinctions, it means as was pointed out in Federa

12

Marine Terminals v. Burnside that the same rule of duty, the:

13

same duty of care

14

his employees and that that distinction should not be made.

15

That was quite explicit there..
The fortuily, finally, of presence of someone on the

21

22
23
24

25

applies to the stevedore contractor and to

vessel should not determine the duty.

There is no duty to be

there and inspect, as this Court recognized in West, and
therefore

no special duty because one happens to be there.
Thank you, Your Honors.
