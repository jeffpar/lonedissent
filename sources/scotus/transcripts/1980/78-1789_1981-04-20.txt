ORAL ARGUMENT OF REUBEN GOLDBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OE THE PETITIONER

MR. GOLDBERG:

Mr. Goldberg, you

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
This case involves a suit filed by the respondents in
the State Court of Louisiana

with

respect to a contract that

is on file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as the
respondent’s Rate Schedule No. 4.

In that suit they sought dam­

ages which were in fact a claim for a retroactive rate increase
under the Natural Gas Act.

The respondents were successful in

that suit and it is petitioner's position that the decision of
the court below violated the Filed Rate Doctrine, violated the

16

primary jurisdiction of the Commission and its exclusive rate
17

jurisdiction and Commission regulations.

And I should say to

18

the Court that these positions were steadfastly maintained
19

through each of the courts through the State of Louisiana, the
20

trial court as well as the courts of appeal.
21

The contract between petitioner and respondents pro­
22

vides for the sale by respondents to petitioner at the wellhead
23

of the entire stream of wet gas from respondents' wells located
24

in the Sligo field in North Louisiana.

I should say at this

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

3

1

point that gas is known as wet gas when the gas stream contains

2

liquefiable hydrocarbons.

3

in the gas stream in a gaseous state and they are extractable

4

through a simple process at a processing plant at the surface.

5

When these liquefiable hydrocarbons have been extracted, the

6

gas stream is known as dry gas or residue gas, and the terms

7

are used interchangeably.
Now, to return to the contract which is at the seat

8

9
1
11
12
13
14

These liquefiable hydrocarbons exist

of this case,

the negotiations leading to its execution were

quite lengthy.

The respondents wanted a provision included in

the contract which is known in the industry as a favored nation
provision.

They wanted one that would escalate fixed prices

that had been agreed to in the contract if any buyer of gas in
the Sligo field paid any seller a price higher than the fixed
prices in the contract.

They also wanted the favored nation

15

provision to apply to liquefiable hydrocarbons and to conden­
16

sate, which is a form of crude oil that at the surface without
17

any processing drops out; it becomes a liquid and drops out
18

in the separator.
19

The favored nation provision that finally emerged when
20

the petitioner rejected these proposals of respondent is the
21

one that appears in the contract.

It's in the Joint Appendix

22

at page 99.

It does not apply to hydrocarbons and condensate

23

and is triggered only by the purchase of gas by petitioner in
24

the Sligo field from -- and I quote these words, because they
25
North American Heportinq
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

4

1

are important -- "another party seller" at a price higher than

2

the fixed prices established in the contract for the wet gas.
The favored nation provision provides that in deter­

3
4

mining whether a given price is in fact a higher price, the

5

provisions of the contracts being compared bearing on that de­

6

termination such as point of delivery, delivery pressure, are

7

to be compared and adjustments made for the differences between

8

them.

9

made for them can it be known whether in fact the favored natior

10

was triggered.
Petitioner also agreed to a proposal that had' been

11
12
13
14

Only when the differences are found and adjustments are

made by respondents for the elimination from the contract of
payments for extracted liquids in return for an increase in the
price for the gas of 1/4 of a cent.
The favored nation provision during the negotiations

15

received so much attention and was so carefully dealt with by
16

the petitioner that it actually became thereafter the model for
17

petitioner's favored nation provisions in contracts.

In 1954,

18

after this Court in the Phillips Petroleum case had declared
19

that producers of natural gas selling gas in interstate commerce
20

were subject to the Natural Gas Act, the respondents filed a
21

contract and secured from the Commission certificates of public
22

convenience and necessity to make the sales as required by the
23

Act.

And as I have said before, at the outset, it's the respon­

24

dents' Rate Schedule No. 4 on file with the Commission.
25

1

Some years later, in 1961, the petitioner acquired an

2

interest in a United States Government mineral lease of lands

3

in the Sligo field, the very same field.

4

quired that interest, thereby became obligated to make royalty

5

payments to the United States for the value of the extracted

6

liquid hydrocarbons and condensate and for the value of the resi

7

due or dry gas.

8

been withheld for a time by the Government from production and

9

development but it developed that adjacent landowners were

10

11
12
13

Petitioner, having ac­

The lands involved in the government lease had

draining the minerals from underneath the Government lands and
the Government opened them up to development and that produced
the government lease.
And it is interesting that the Hall group -- I refer
to the respondents sometimes as the Hall group -- had land adja­

14

cent to the government lease.
15

Petitioner's acquisition of the interest in the govern'
16

ment lease was not concealed from anyone.

The petitioner had no

17

reason to keep the matter hidden; it did not keep it hidden; and
18

it could not have been kept hidden from knowledgeable, active
19

oil and gas men such as existed in the Hall group.
20

Additionally, the papers assigning the interest to the
21

petitioner and the approval of the assignment was a matter of
22

public record.

It was recorded in the Recorder's Office of

23

Bossier Parish, and actually, in the 1962 report to Its stock­
24

holders, the petitioner discussed in that report its interest
25

1

in the lease and its activities thereunder.

2

right here that despite the charges of fraudulent concealment by

3

the respondents in the lower courts, the trial court made no

4

findings on the point.

5

the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, found that there was no frau­

10

11

And I should say

The intermediate court of appeal,

dulent concealment and that finding was affirmed by the Supreme
Court of the State of Louisiana, and the fact is there was no
concealment of any kind of the facts with respect to the lease,
fraudulent or otherwise.
QUESTION:

Well, but the respondents' position as I

understand it, Mr. Goldberg, is that Arkla had a duty under the
contract to report that they were getting a higher price from

12

the United States than they were getting from the respondents.
13

That's their position, isn't it?
14

MR. GOLDBERG:

I'm not sure that they expressly

sta­

15

ted that claim but our position is -16

QUESTION:

I don't find the complaint here -- I under­

17

stood from the briefs that, in effect, what they're saying is,
18

you breached the contract by not formally advising them you were
19

getting a higher price from the United States than you were
20

getting from them?

and that this is a breach of contract.

21

MR. GOLDBERG:

No, their claim of a breach of contract

22

Is that the royalty payments made under the government lease
23

constituted a purchase from a party seller, the Government, of
24

gas, and that therefore, since that's the language of the

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

7

1

favored nation provision, and they claim that it was a higher

2

price than the fixed prices in the contract, and therefore,

3

they said, the favored nation provision was triggered.
QUESTION:

vision came within purchase until that was decided in '78,
wasn't it, or something like that?
HR. GOLDBERG:

8

10

Well, as I recall it, you argue in the

No, it's our position that settled

Louisiana law as well as federal law says that a royalty payment
is not a purchase of gas.
QUESTION:

11

The reason is that a --

But in 1978 did not the Louisiana courts

construe the word "purchase" as including what happened here?
12

MR. GOLDBERG:

Oh, yes, yes.

13

QUESTION:

And you didn't know about it, you say,

14

until 1978?

But wouldn't that be a defense to a contract

15

action?
16

MR. GOLDBERG:

Our defense to the contract action --

17

QUESTION:

Well, I know, you're arguing that primary

18

jurisdiction, they have no jurisdiction to do this at all. But i f
19

it's a simple contract claim, breach of contract claim.
20

MR. GOLDBERG: Well, we also -21

QUESTION:

And you had that defense.

22

MR. GOLDBERG:

We also say that under the terms of

23

the contract, the favored nation provision was not triggered
24

because the royalty payments did not constitute a purchase and

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

the decision of the court below was in error.

2

Mr. Justice Brennan, the Court of Appeal agreed with the peti­

3

tioner that under settled state and federal jurisprudence the

4

royalty payments did not constitute a purchase, but it went on,

5

nevertheless, to hold, that there was a triggering by reason of

6

the royalty payments, we say, and that decision ignored the

7

commonly understood and accepted usage of the phrase "pur­

8

chase" -QUESTION:

MR. GOLDBERG:
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but is that anything we can

review?

In actual fact,

What we've asked you to do here --

What's the federal question involved in

that?
MR. GOLDBERGi Whether the award of the< court below vio­
lated the Filed Rate Doctrine, violated the primary jurisdictior
and exclusive rate jurisdiction of the Commission, and regula­
tions of the Commission.
QUESTION:

But if the respondents had known that the

favored nation clause was triggered, if you had told them so,
9

or at least had given them the information on which they could
20

conclude that, I take it between '62 and '72 they might have
2

gone to the federal commission and got approval of the rates.
22

MR. GOLDBERG:

I don't know

what

they

would have

23

done but that's what they should have done.

That's what they

24

should have done.

QUESTION:

Well, maybe they -- well, they didn't know,

they didn't know; you didn't tell them.
MR. GOLDBERG:

And even if they didn't know it and

4

found out for1 the first time in '74 -- let's assume that for the

5

sake of argument

-- their proper course of action was to go to

6

the Commission.

The fact of the matter is,

7

to the Commission recently asking for a waiver of the filing

8

requirements, recognizing that they were in jeopardy without

9

that waiver.

10

11
12
13
14

they finally did go

So that if they had asked for the waiver at that

time, at any time earlier than 1974, they would have been con­
fronted by the same proposition, that the Commission has denied
on the merits that request for a waiver in a very well reasoned
order which is an appendix to our reply brief.
But I think we started
whether they had

out on the proposition as to

made some other claim, and I don't recall that

15

they made any other claim other than the royalty payments con­
16

stituted the purchase.
17

QUESTION:

Do you contend, Mr. Goldberg, that the

18

reasoning of this recent order would have applied if they had
19

asked, or if they'd filed back in 1962 or '63?
20
MR. GOLDBERG:

In 1962 they were asking for an increas e

21

back to 1961 -22
QUESTION:

But you think the reasoning of this order

23

would have applied?
24

MR. GOLDBERG:

Yes, I --

25

2

QUESTION:
they were so late.

3
4

I thought it was based on the fact that

MR. GOLDBERG:

We would have had the same considera­

tions that the Commission refers to.

5

QUESTION:

If they came in '62 and said, we want to

6

get the higher rate for the period '62 to '72, the next ten

7

years.

8

MR. GOLDBERG:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. GOLDBERG:
QUESTION:

12

16
17

We do not.

We do not.

You don't deny that it was at least possi­

ble the Commission would have let them do that?
MR. GOLDBERG:

14
15

We don't know whether the Commission would

have let them do it or not.

11

13

I don't think they could come in and --

Well, the present Federal Energy

Regulatory Commission as presently constituted has said in their
order that they hesitate to speculate on what the Commission
would have done.

I do, too.

QUESTION:

18

Well, doesn't that mean that it was at

least a possibility that it would have been done had they been
19

able to act promptly?
20

MR. GOLDBERG:

I suppose that possibility could

21

exist.

The possibility could exist also that they might not

22

have been able to demonstrate either that there was triggering
23

or that It was in fact a higher price.
24

QUESTION:

But who's responsible for the fact that

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

11

1

they were unable to go in in '62?

2

MR. GOLDBERG:

Not the petitioner.

The petitioner,

3

we submit, did everything that was required of it, and there

4

is no provision in the contract, nothing --

5

QUESTION:

But if you read the contract the other

6

way.

7

we assume that the Louisiana court correctly reads the contract

8

and that you did have a duty to notify them, then are you not

9

responsible for the delay?

10

11
12
13
14
15
16
17

Now, that depends on how one reads the contract.

MR. GOLDBERG:

But if

If you assume that we had a duty, then

I suppose it would be we would be responsible for the delay
If that is the federal jurisprudence, because this contract
Is not controlled by state jurisdiction, state jurisprudence.
It is a contract on file as a rate schedule.

As a rate schedule

under the Natural Gas Act it is the federal jurisprudence that
determines how that contract is to be handled and interpreted,
particularly in the light of the public interest requirements
of the Natural Gas Act.

This is one of the difficulties with

18

the state court's decision.

The state court referred to

19

Article 2040 of the Louisiana Civil Code and determined that
20

under that civil code provision there was a duty upon -- that
21

being, not a duty, but that the petitioner had prevented the
22

respondents from complying with the rate change filing require­
23

ments of the Act, and that therefore they should be deemed as
24

having fulfilled those requirements.

And I point out in that

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

12

1

connection that the court also recognized when it said that,

2

that it was dealing with the Natural Gas Act and that it had to

3

meet the next requirement, would the

And it concluded, yes, the Commission would have allowed

QUESTION:

The state court said, on the preponderance

of the evidence we think it's more likely they would than they
would have not.

And as I understand, the Commission said, well,

we don't know what we would have done.
MR. GOLDBERG:

I think that we could have demonstratec

to the Commission -QUESTION:

But you didn't.

MR. GOLDBERG:

We didn't because they made no filing,

but if you're asking me to speculate -QUESTION:

No, all I asked you was whether or nol­

15

it were possible as a matter of law that they could have ruled
16

in favor of allowing the higher rate, back if they'd made a
17

timely filing?
18

MR. GOLDBERG:

If they also met the qualifications

19

of the favored

--

the

Cfimmission

would have had to find

20

that the favored nation was triggered because the royalty pay­
21

ments constituted a purchase from any party seller.

I have

22

difficulty seeing how the

Commission could have decided that.

23

The jurisprudence was against that decision and a royalty
24

interest has no gas to sell.
25
North American Reporting

13

1

QUESTION:

I thought the way the case comes to us we

2

assume for purposes of whether the Filed Rate Doctrine applies

3

or not that there was a violation of the favored nations agree­

4

ment, the duty and all the rest.

5

theless, the Filed Rate Doctrine precludes the higher rate.

6

7
8

9
10
11
12
13

MR. GOLDBERG:

And you argue, well, never­

That's right, because the allowance

by the court below violates the determinations under the Filed
Rate Doctrine.

It violates the Commission's ceiling prices.

I would point out also that the Commission in that
order of November 5, 1980, which is part of, attached to our
reply brief as an appendix, that the Commission points out that
its review of the record reveals to it, and it concludes, that
Arkla could reasonably have assumed that the royalty payments
did not trigger the favored nation provision.

And I submit that,

14

under those circumstances, if we could have reasonably assumed
15

that, I think the more reasonable inference is that we could
16

have demonstrated to the Commission, if back in 1962, perhaps,
17

and the Commission would not in 1962 have found that the favored
18

nation provisions had been triggered.
19

The file doctrine says, the Filed Rate Doctrine says
20

that no one can claim a rate as a legal right that is other thar
21

the filed rate, and that not even a court can authorize commerce
22

in the commodity on other terms.

Now, the courts below sought

23

to avoid the Filed Rate Doctrine by labeling respondents' claim
24

as a claim for damages.

QUESTION:

1

I suppose, Mr. Goldberg, your position

2

would be that it applied even, even had Arkla here deliberately

3

and intentionally not informed the respondents that they were

4

getting a higher rate in a situation where they should have

5

given it?

6

7
8
9
10

I guess you'd still say that under the filed rate

doctrine, nevertheless, they can't prevail.
MR. GOLDBERG:

Yes, but I'd like to say first, we

don't have to go that far, back to the states.
QUESTION:

I know. But answer my question. Am I right?

MR. GOLDBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

That's

how far you would go?

11

MR. GOLDBERG:

Yes.

12

QUESTION:

All right.

13

MR. GOLDBERG:

And we say, also, that if you read

14

Montana-Dakota, in that situation, where the Filed Rate Doctrine
15

was held to apply, the complainant in that case, the plaintiff
16

in that case was under the thumb of a parent corporation, was
17

clearly prevented from going before the Commission and protest­
18

ing the rates involved.

Nevertheless, it was held that the File d

19

Rate Doctrine precluded them from having a claim.

And we say

20

that that is no less the situation in this case.
21
22
23
24

QUESTION:

Isn't it correct that that case really just

held that that precluded them from having a claim under the
federal statute.

It didn't really decide whether there might be

a state law claim of some kind?

MR. GOLDBERG:

MR. GOLDBERG:

QUESTION:

Correct.

MR. GOLDBERG:

8

10

They sought to draw a right to their

cause of action from the terms of the federal Power Act itself.

7

9

That case did arise in the federal judicial

system and the. first .question is whether federal jurisdiction --

5

6

No, we think that if you read the case

But a reading of that decision clearly

demonstrates that even if they had gone to the state court they
could not have maintained that action, and that they -QUESTION:

11

They could not have maintained an action

for violation of the Federal Power Act in the state court but the
12

court really didn't have any occasion to decide whether there
13

was any breach of fiduciary relationship that might give rise
14

to a common law claim.
15

MR. GOLDBERG:

I think the --

16

QUESTION:

Which

wasn't before the court.

17

MR. GOLDBERG:

I think the language of the court in

18

that case clearly says that by reason of the fact that there is
19

a Federal Power Act there Is no recourse available to the state
20
court either.

If they had any recourse it would have been only

21

to the Commission.

If the respondents here had any recourse

22

it was only to the Commission and they have gone to the Commis­
23

sion and the Commission has pretty well indicated in that order
4

24

of November 5, 1980, that they are not entitled to the relief
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

16

1

that they claim.

2

assert that the contract is to be interpreted on the basis of

3

state law and that it derives its force and effect from state

4

law.

5

fect, particularly with respect to rate matters, from the

6
7
8

9

The decision of the court below undertakes to

.The fact of the matter is, it derives its force and ef­

Natural Gas Act, and it is federal jurisprudence that determines
how that contract is to be interpreted.

And under federal

jurisdiction -- I refer particularly to the Mobile case -there is no purchase of gas associated with the payment of a
royalty.

10

When the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that the
11

Commission would undoubtedly have allowed the rate

had thev

12

gone to the Commission at an earlier time, we think the court
13

was induced to make that statement by a statement by the
14

Commission in an earlier order it had issued in which it said
15

that the rates did not exceed the ceiling prices.

The Commis­

16

sion has since that time advised that it was in error because
17

it thought the sale was a sale at the plant and not a sale at
18

the wellhead.

As a sale at the wellhead it clearlv exceeded

19

the ceiling prices and the Commission says very clearly it was
20
21

22
23
24

a violation of the Filed Rate Doctrine.
With respect to the matter of primary jurisdiction,
the Commission's exclusive rate jurisdiction extends not only

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES FLEET HOWELL, ESO.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

8

MR. HOWELL:

9
10

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
Respondents respectfully submit that the core funda­

11

mental issue presented in this case involves the separate and
12

independent obligation of the petitioner herein, Arkansas Louis­
13

iana Gas Company, to respond in compensatory damages out of its
14

own assets and profits for the. actual losses that it wrongfully
15

caused the 15 individual respondents herein to sustain and
16

incur from September, 1961, through December, 1975, by continuou s17

ly

breaching

and violating their favored nations rights under

18

the '52 contract and by uncooperatively and effectively with­
19

holding all of the true, relevant, and material facts concern­
20

ing that breach of contract from respondents from 19 6.1 through
21

1975.

We respectfully submit that the statement of the situa­

tion concerning the payments that Arkla made to the United
States Government by opposing counsel are not preciselv consis­

tive lease contract, Exhibit P-45, reflects that that contract

3

anticipated the situation that actually existed between Arkla

An examination of Section 2(n) of the 1961 protec­

4

and the Government.
In other words, Arkla was in a dual capacity.

5

It was

6

not the typical lessee.

7

line purchaser that owned and operated a pipeline system and a

8

gas processing plant in the Sligo field, and under Section 2(n)

9

of that Government lease contract Arkla was obligated contrac­

10

11
12
13
14

It was a lessee that was also a pipe­

tually to purchase the Government's gas at reasonable rates and
reasonable prices.

And the Government did require Arkla to pay

the prices the Government felt was reasonable for the Govern­
ment's royalty gas as delivered into Arkla's Sligo pipeline
system.

As evidenced by Exhibit P-82, Arkla and the Govern­

ment negotiated as to the price that Arkla would have to pay to
15

the Government for the Government's royalty gas and the explicit
16

language of that letter contract, Exhibit P-82, sets forth so
17

many cents per Mcf to be paid by Arkla for the Government's
18

royalty gas.
19

Now, with respect to the problem that these respon­
20

dents had in discovering and obtaining the true facts concern­
21

ing Arkla's payments of

higher prices to the United States

22

Government for the Government's royalty gas produced in the
23

Sligo field and delivered into Arkla's Sligo pipeline system
24

and into Arkla's Sligo gas processsing plant, I think we must
25
North American Heportinq
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

19

1

begin with the fact that at the time it became necessary for

2

Arkla to arrive at a price that it would pay the Government,

3

one of their officials, Mr. J. C. Templeton, a vice president

4

who was in charge of negotiating price on behalf of Arkla with

5

the Government, wrote a memorandum on November 17, 1961, to

6

Mr. B. E. Harrell, the senior vice president who actually nego­

7

tiated our '52 contract on behalf of Arkla, and inquired of

8

Mr. Harrell, what price should we pay the Government?

9

Mr. Harrell came back with a memorandum dated Novem­

10

ber 20, 1961, which is in evidence as Exhibit P-58, wherein he

11
12
13
14

said, "I have no particular opinion as to what price Arkla
should pay the Government but I do wish to point out that we
hqve a favored nations contract with Mr. W. E. Hall et al. and
they are receiving approximately 8-1/2 cents at this time."
Here is the company official who was very familiar

15

with the negotiations that led to the perfection of the '52
16

contract and he said, I do not know whether payment of a higher
17

price to the Government would breach, activate, or trigger this
18

favored nations clause.

But if it does, it could cost Arkla

19

millions of dollars during the life of the '52 contract.

So,

20

in Arkla's -- in the mind of their chief vice president who
21

negotiated the contract with respondents in '52, there was a
22

serious question about whether the payment of a higher price to
23

the Government would activate or trigger this favored nations
24

clause.

One month later, on December 27, 1961, the corporate

2

counsel, Mr. Robert Roberts, Jr., had received a copy of

3

Mr. Harrell's warning memorandum, wrote the company, and said,

in connection with the government lease contract -- and this

5

memorandum is in evidence as Exhibit P-62, he said, it's a very

So, with

As testified to by Frank Hall, he and his now-deceasec
father, W. E. Hall, Sr., went to Arkla's office month after
month, year after year, from '61 to '73, to seek to determine
if Arkla was paying anybody else a higher price in the Sligo
field, obviously to see if they had any rights under their
favored nations clause.

Each time Mr. Harrell and Mr. Miles,

primarily on behalf of Arkla, told them that they were receiv­
ing the highest prices that Arkla

paid to anyone else in the

16

Sligo field, that Mr. Hall was a royalty owner, he was an
17

overriding royalty interest owner, and a working interest owner,
18

and he didn't delineate, are you paying a higher price for
19

royalty gas or are you paying a higher price for working inter­
20

est gas, he just said, are you paying anyone else in the field
21

a-higher price?
22

On each occasion, they were told, you're getting the
23

highest price that we're paying to anyone else in the field.
24

Now, these people relied upon this, they believed it in good

Yes, sir.
Even if it were conceded that the contract

is say, prospectively, you may charge higher rates?

MR. HOWELL

Well, at the time we found out about it,

13

Your Honors, in 1974 -14

QUESTION:

Well, that's the problem.

15

MR. HOWELL

Yes, sir, that is the problem.

That is

16

the problem.

And it s our position that Arkla's breach of the

17

contract and withholding of the facts gave rise to a separate
18

and independent cause of action under state law for recovery of
19

damages to be paid by Arkla and the stockholders and not to be
20
included in Arkla's rate base or passed on to consumers.

And I

21
believe this Court in 1961, as I read the Pan American Petroleun
22
v.

Superior Court of Delaware, recognized that the Natural Gas

23

Act, which effectuated a stream of regulation based on private
24

contracts, held that these common law contract rights were not

in the damages awarded for the liquids and the condensate,
based on what the Government received.

We are interested in

14

the damages awarded on the dry residue gas by the Louisiana

courts.

And they ordered us to file copies of our complaints,

16

our amended complaint, and all copies of all the damages evi­

dry residue gas, the difference between what we received and
19

what the Government received during this period '61 to '72.
20

And we filed that and they issued an order on May 18, 1979,
21

saying that our damages were measured by what the Government
22

received and what the Government received was fair and square

with the Natural Gas Act, below the area rate ceilings, and no

So after the

the dry residue gas from '61 to '72, we should seek a waiver
of the Section 4(d) notice filing based upon Arkla's withholding
of the facts in the prevention of performance in estoppel.
So, we filed for the waiver alleging that our prices
were below area rate ceilings, that we were prevented from

14

filing, there was no humanly possible way that we could make
15

the filing. And the Commission ruled that in

essence we're

16

denying the waiver because it goes back 20 years.

And that

goes into the Catch-22 -- it goes back 20 years because they

MR. HOWELL:

Your Honor, the other side,

We made a filing to

we had taken the appeal to the 5th Circuit.

prices for its gas sold in interstate commerce.

contract is completely destroyed, 15 citizens who contracted in

just think the result is so inequitable, especially in light
of the fundamental principle that this Court has passed down
case after case, starting with United States v. Peck in 1880,
that a party to a contract that prevents the performance of
that contract may not rely upon its own breach of contract,

Because breaching contracts or

A pipeline company is supposed to honor

It's supposed

to honor people's civil rights as well as their private rights.
And if the Court is worried about the consumers having to pay
any of these damages by Arkla passing it through, Arkla has to
pursue that through a separate proceeding before the Commission
and receive Commission approval.

If the Commission is concernec.

12

about Arkla trying to pass any of this corporate damage obliga­

tion on to the public, the Commission can simply deny the
14

attempt to pass through and make Arkla, the wrongdoer that
15

caused these losses and damages, simply stand behind its obliga­

tion to make these people whole.
17

QUESTION:

Would you think that if this were a com­

18

pletely private contract, no filed rates, just a contract be­
19

tween two private parties, that the doctrine of laches might
20

move in and cut you off at some point in that period or not?
21

MR. HOWELL:

Your Honor, not as long as they were

22

withholding the facts, and I was getting to that a while ago.
23

Mr. Frank Hall, one of the respondents, was having lunch at the
24

Freeport Petroleum Club in January, 1974, when he inadvertently
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

36

1

overheard a conversation between two gentlemen assumed to be

2

employees of Arkla talking about the prices that Arkla was

3

paying the Government.

4

respondents had any idea that Arkla was paying a higher price

5

to the Government or paying any price to the Government at all,

6

and so, if laches would occur, it would seem like January of

7

'74 would be the earliest time that they could have taken any

8

action, and what they did after that was, they wrote letters to

9

Arkla and called Arkla and asked them to give them the facts.

10

11
12
13
14

That’s the first time any of these

And Arkla continued to withhold the facts.

Will Hall, Jr.,

wrote letters to the Department of the Interior and asked them
to tell him what prices Arkla was paying the

Government.

The

Department of Interior took the position that that was privilege d
proprietary information, what the Department of Interior was
receiving for

we, the people's royalty gas, and refused to

15

give them the information.
16

So they had to hire me in May of 1974 to simply obtair
17

the facts.

They didn't have the facts when they retained me

18

in 1974, and pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act I fi­
19

nally received the information.

MR. HOWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

1

the Court:
Immediately before the noon recess I was addressing

2
3

some questions about laches, and would like to follow that

4

through, Your Honors.
As I was saying, that I had not been able on behalf

5

6
7
8

9
10

11

of my clients to obtain the true facts until I received a letter
from the United States Department of Interior dated June 24,
1974.

That's in evidence as Exhibit P-142, where the Department

of Interior advised me on behalf of these respondents as to the
actual prices that the Government had been receiving from Arkla
for its royalty gas in Sligo field.

At that time I made a

written demand upon Arkla for a full disclosure of all of the
12

true facts, specifically, copies of their contracts with the
13

Government and specifically all of the information concerning
14

the prices that Arkla had been, was then paying to the United
15

States Government, copies of checks, and other sales reports
16

and production reports.

And that amicable plan was rejected.

17

In essence they forced us to file a lawsuit to judicially dis­
18

cover all of the truth, relevant material, and necessary facts
19

from Arkla's own files and records.
20

And as the record in this case will reflect, we went
21

through about two years of litigation which were devoted solely
22

to discovery.

We had to file motion after motion and obtain

23

order after order in order to obtain all of the true facts
24

necessary to prove the breach of contract and to prove the
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

losses and damages.

2

waiver of the notice filing requirement only came up, as I said,

3

in 1979, when the FERC staff counsel suggested that in order to

4

obtain the damages for the dry residue gas from '61 to '72, that

5

we should think of obtaining a waiver of the notice

6

requirement, which we very promptly filed for in May of 1979.

7

And the waiver application was based on two contentions, one

8

in light of the Western Natural v. Cities Service litigation

9

that a waiver should not be necessary when it's a breach of

10

11

12
13
14

And the issue concerning obtaining a

filing

contract that prevented you from making the filing in the first
instance.

But that if it was, we were entitled to it, because

Arkla, by breaching the contract and withholding the facts from
respondents for 14 years and then requiring respondents to go
through six years of litigation to discover and prove the true
facts, certainly the 20-year period that had elapsed was the

15

fault of Arkla and not the fault of these respondents.
16

And, of course, after the waiver was denied on
17

November 5, 1980, we immediately filed a petition for rehearing
18

with the Commission which was denied on January 2.
19

QUESTION:

Are there many precedents, Mr. Howell,

20

waivers by the Commission?
21

MR. HOWELL:

Yes, sir.

The two leading appellate

22

decisions from the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals are the Pla­
23

quemines case, decided in 1971.

The Commission had declined

24

to grant a waiver of a Section 4(d) notice filing for a five-year
25

39

1

period prior to '71, and the Court of Appeals, the D. C. Circuit

2

Court of Appeals ordered the Commission to grant a waiver if it

3

found that the prices provided for under the contract were belov,

4

area rate ceilings.

5

Commissiqn to grant the waiver.

And so it reversed and remanded to the

In the Piqua case, decided by the Commission in 1978,

6
7

the Commission granted a waiver saying that the Commission had

8

a long history of granting waivers where through some inequity

9

there was the noncompliance with the procedural notice filing

requirement.

And

they

said, in order to protect the integri­

ty of the contract and the true intentions of the parties, they
should grant a waiver to clear up the absence of the prospective
notice filing

requirement.

QUESTION:

14

So that --

So you were surprised when you got the

denial?
15

MR. HOWELL:

I've never been more shocked in my life,

16

Your Honor, to be quite frank.

We felt that -- and even the

17

Commission recognized that the Louisiana courts had held, the
18

courts to whom the Commission had deferred, had held that Arkla
19

In breach of its contractual obligations failed to disclose the
20

facts.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REUBEN GOLDBERG, ESQ.,
24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
25
North American Reporting

1

MR. GOLDBERG:

2

Counsel referred to Section 2(n) of the Government

Just a few things here.

4

5

would have had to purchase.

8

option to take gas in kind instead of accepting royalty payments

9

If it had exercised that option, it would have had gas to sell,

gas it would have sold.

15

The Government had no gas

Arkla produced its own gas and it

The Government under the lease had the

And in order to have, to assure itself

of a purchaser, Section (n) was in the provisions, but if it
did not exercise that option Section (n) was entirely irrelevant
Counsel keeps saying that they purchased residue gas

13
14

It has absolutely

and the Commission was misled at one time too, and it has cor­
rected itself.

It was basing its opinion that there was no

breach in the ceiling prices, based upon the fact that it
16

thought residue gas had been purchased.

And if the Court will

17

refer to our reply brief at pages 11 and 12

you will find the

18

Commission's statement retracting their earlier statement and
19

explaining why they had been misled.
20

Now, counsel also referred to a legal opinion which
21

he said demonstrated a reference to the difficulty of the prob­
22

lem.

That legal opinion had nothing to do with triggering.

It

23

was related, triggering of the favored nation clause.

It was

24

related to balancing takes from other producers, from a number
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

41

1

of producers, how you balance takes.
There was a legal opinion dealing with triggering.

2
3

When the Government demanded rents or royalty payments in ex­

4

cess of the fixed prices in the contract, Arkla was concerned

5

about agreeing to that without first knowing whether it would

6
7
8

9

10

trigger favored nation provisions and it submitted the question
to its counsel and its counsel said, favored nations will not
be triggered by the royal payment.

A royalty payment is not a

purchase of gas under well-settled federal and state jurisdic­
tion.

Now -QUESTION:

11

But counsel, a moment ago you referred to

the fact that the Commission was misled and cited us to a foot­

in your brief on page 11, I believe.

And as I read

13

that footnote -14

MR. GOLDBERG:

Page 11 of the reply brief.

15

QUESTION:

Oh, of your reply brief?

And is that an

16

FERC proceeding?
17

MR. GOLDBERG:

Yes; yes.

That's at the bottom of

18

page 11 and the top of page 12; there's a two-paragraph quota­
19

tion .
20

QUESTION: Is there any argument in this case about
21

-- or I'll put it the other way -- must we decide whether these
22

companies are small companies that are freed from the filing
23

requirements as of '72?
24

MR. GOLDBERG:

Is there an issue about that?
Yes.

There is a small producer issue

25

in the case.

2

haven't had the time to get to it.
QUESTION:

4

We discussed it in our brief, but I just simply

But you mean, if someone is a small pro­

ducer, then from '72 on there is no dispute?
MR. GOLDBERG:

5

Not unless they can demonstrate --

6

there still is the question, even if you're a small producer.

7

The small producer exemption says, you don't have to make a

8

9
10

filing to get the rate increase but you still have to demon­
strate, you still have to show that the increase is contrac­
tually authorized and that it is reasonable.
QUESTION:

11
12

So that --

Well, then, it'd all go back to the state

court?
MR. GOLDBERG:

13

Well, that's a question for the

Commission.
14

QUESTION:

Why is that?

15

MR. GOLDBERG:

Because it's within the Commission's

16

primary jurisdiction and ih its exclusive -17

QUESTION:

I thought the Commission in this very case

18

said that to the extent these companies are small producers,
19

then it's up to the state court after '72?
20

MR. GOLDBERG:

No,

I don't think the Commission said

21

that.

The Commission did say, in some order, that there were

22

five of the respondents that had small producer certificates
23

but that the benefit of the small producer exemption was
24

available to all of the respondents.

It did say that.
