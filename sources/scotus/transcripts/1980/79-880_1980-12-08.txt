ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. McCREE, JR., ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

We will hear- arguments

MR. McCREE:

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:

9

This case requires this Court for the first time in

10

the history of the nation to determine the: extent of the per­

11

sonal immunity of the President: of the United States and his

12

closest advisors

13

violation of constitutional rights resulting from the perform­

14

ance of his official duties.

15

In ButZ

for money damages arising from the .claimed

V.

Economo-Uj

decided during the 19 7 7 term,

16

the Court held that although a qualified immunity from damages

17

liability should be: the general rule for executive officials

18

charged with a violation of the Constitution, there are some

19

officials whose special functions require a full exemption from

20

such liability.

21

States, the constitutional head of the second branch of govern­

22

ment, is preeminently such an official, and that officers car­

23

rying out his express directions should be protected by an

24

immunity derivative of his.

25

We submit that the President of the United

The facts in this case may be succinctly stated.
3

1

Between February and April, 1969, when the nation was engaged

2

in armed conflict in Southeast Asia, the President and several

3

of his top advisors were deeply concerned about unauthorized

4

disclosures to the news media of confidential information, in­

5

cluding foreign policy documents.

6

the unauthorized disclosure of this material would jeopardize

7

the Government's foreign policy initiatives, and would ser­

8

iously undermine the confidence of our allies in our relia­

9

bility about classified disclosures to us.

The President feared that

The nature of some of the unauthorized disclosures

10
1 1

made the National Security Council a likely source of the

12

security leaks.

13

Attorney General, the Director of the National Security

14

Council, and the Director of the FBI , to discuss remedial mea­

15

sures,

16

surveillance would be. a method of discovering the source of

17

the; leaks,

18

Accordingly, the President met with the

Upon the advice of the FBI Director, that electronic

the President authorized the use of wiretaps.
The FBI Director prepared a list of officials in

19

the office of the National Security Council Advisor who had

20

access to documents similar to those that were released, and

21

who possessed other characteristics that suggested that they

22

might be likely soux’ces of the unauthorized disclosures.

23
24

25

This list included the; name of Dr. Halperin, principal
respondent in this case.
The Attorney General approved the installation of

4

1

a tap on the residence phone of Dr. Halperin and that was ac­

2

complished in May, 19G9.

3

from this disclosure were prepared and disseminated, ultimately

4

through the Assistant to the President, Mr. Haldeman, another

5

one; of the petitioners , who would bring pertinent data to the

6

attention of the President and to the Director of the National

7

Security Council.
The tap failed to reveal that Dr. Halperin was the

8
9

10

source of the leaks, and it was removed from the telephone on
his residence, in February, 19 71.
QUESTION:

1 1

12

Summaries of information obtained

Was that 21 months after

it

had

been

installed?

13

MR. McCRFE:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

14

Two years later, when Dr. Halperin learned of the

15

tap, he, his wife, and children filed in the United States

16

District Court for the District of Columbia this action,

17

alleging that the wiretap was unlawful under the Fourth Amend­

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

25

ment and under Title III of the Omnibus Crime and Safe Streets
Act of 1968.

Petitioners, other federal defendants, and the

telephone company were named as defendants and monetary damages,
declaratory and injunctive relief, were sought.
After extensive discovery, petitioner's motion for
summary judgment on the Title III

claim

that's the Omnibus

Crime and Safe Streets Act -- was granted, and that issue is
not before the Court in this appeal.

Addressing the Fourth Amendment cla.ims, although it

12

recognized that there was justifiably grave concern in 1969

13

over leaks and -- and I'd like to quote -- "even granting the

14

inapplicability of the general warrant requirement, the

15

district court held that the wireta.p was constitutional ly un­

16

reasonable because it was continued for 21 months wi.thout an

17

effort to minimize the number or type of conversations over­

18

heard.1' The court imposed liability in the following manner:

19

upon the former President

for not imposing temporal or infor­

20

mational limits on the taps; upon the Attorney General for

21

having failed to carry out review; and renewal obligations over

22
23
24

25

the 21-month period; upon the Assistant to the President for
having reviev/ed the information for over a year wi.thout recom­
mending termination, for disseminating information, and for
purposes unrelated to the original justification.

We did not petition.
You did not petition that; right.
That's correct, Mr. Justice Stevens.

The district court found no liability on the part of

10

Dr. Kissinger.

1 1

President and the other petitioners were not entitled to an

12

absolute immunity for damages liability and although their

13

conduct was not -- and I would like to quote -- "a wanton,

14

reckless, or malicious disregard" of respondents' rights,

15

theless they were not entitled to a qualified good faith im­

16

munity from damages liability because -- and I'd like to quote

17

again -- "their activities relating to the wiretap's con­

18

tinuance were unreasonable, and in violation of established

19

Fourth Amendment rights" and because "they are charged with

20

knowledge of established law."

The district court also determined that the

Since respondents proved no actual injury, they were

22

given the relief of having certain exonerating material placed

Now, at the outset, we contend that to subject the
President of the United States to personal damages for official
acts in his capacity as the nation's chief executive is
8

1

contrary to compelling reasons of public policy as well as to

2

the design of the Constitution.

3

munity is absolutely necessary to protect the decision-making

4

pi'ocesses of the President in his conduct of the official busi­

5

ness.

6

less and decisive exercise of presidential authority which the

7

nation has a right to expect.

We submit that absolute im­

The risk of personal liability would inhibit the fear­

8

Just as a judge, who this Court has determined enjoys

9

absolute immuni.ty, must make decisions in controversies fraught

10

with passion, and so must' Presidents often make discretionary

1 1

decisions about controversial issues that a.ffect the lives of

12

virtually every American, especially in areas of national

13

defense and foi'eign affairs,

14

gation, the President's discharge of these duties should be

15

motivated solely by his concern for the good of the nation,

16

and not at all by the fear of damages awards.

17

24

which are involved in this liti­

And these fears, we submit, are not de minimis.
In Butz v. Economou, the ad damnum was $32 million.

It is

manifest, we submit, that a qualified immunity is inadequate tc
protect the public interest in the. vigorous and fearless per­
formance of a president's constitutional duties.
The skillful pleader can easily avoid a motion to
dismiss by alleging malice, bad faith, and unreasonableness,
and impose, on the President the burden of the time, the ex­
pense, the personal anxiety, and the inevitable distraction

25

9

1

of litigation.

2

a member of the appellate panel in this caste, directed our at­

3

tention to what he called the increasing frequency by which

4

pla.in1.iffs are "filing suits seeking damage awards against

5

high government officials in their personal capacities, based

6

on alleged constitutional torts."

7

doubt.s whether the usual tests apply to determine the existence

8

of genuine issues of controverted fact would afford any pro­

9

tection to a president from extensive discovery delving into

Judge Gesell, the only district judge who was

We submit that in a subsequent matter, as we. point

13

out in Footnote 34 on page 37 of our brief, that this Court's

14

expectation in Butz, that "insubstantial lawsuits can be

15

quickly terminated by federal courts," alert to the possibility

16

of artful pleading, and that, "firm application of the Federal

17

Rules of Civil Procedure, will insure that federal officials

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

a.re not harassed by frivolous lawsuits," has not been realized,
as a separate opinion of Mr. Justice Powell asserts in Hanrahan
v. Hampton, which has been characterized as the longest jury
trial in the history of United States courts, and must go back
again for several months of trial to determine whether a quali fied immunity which was given to the federal defendants in that
case was available to them.
We next contend that absolute presidential immunity
10

1

should extend t6 officials who acted at his direct and express

2

direction to carry out his authority.

3

president can only act per alios and if his a]ter egos do not

4

enjoy the same absolute immunity which we submit he should re­

5

ceive, then the; public interest in his fearless discharge of

6

his constitutional duties will be utterly frustrated.

It is obvious that a

7

We also contend that an absolute immunity for damages

8

should attach to the giving of advice to the President pursuant

9

to Article II, Section 2, of the United States Constitution

10

by the heads of his departments.

1 1

bility on the part of a. department head who is asked to render

12

advice to the President would deprive the chief executive of­

13

ficer of exactly what the Constitution intended for him to re­

14

ceive, the best judgment, the honest, frank and considered

15

opinion of his subordinate.
However, in this case, to deny absolute immunity

16
17

18

would dry up the source of the kind of advice that would be
necessary for the discharge of the public's business.

Does this go for the entire staff of the

MR. McCREE:

Mr. Justice White, we think that we can

avoid that question here, because we submit -QUESTION:

down the line?
MR. McCREE:

That's right.

QUESTION:

Well, is it your submission that it

MR. McCREE:

QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

For either or both, but we think the

Court can avoid determining whether the subordinate has an
absolute immunity at all.
QUESTION:

I understand that; I understand that.

But which is it in this case?

Is it carrying out the orders

of the President or giving him advice, or both?

MR. McCREE:

another day to determine whether someone with lesser rank in

QUESTION:

I think the whole

is -- I per­

6

sonally think the whole thing's involved, as to how far a

7

president can go in authorizing individuals to violate people's

rights.

9

MR. McCREE:

Well, the derivative immunity which we.

10

claim for him would protect these persons here without deter­

1 1

mining what inherent immunity they themselves possess.

12

QUESTION:

And this is true', because they're acting

13

in effectuation of a specific program for which he, personally,

14

was specifically responsible?

15
16

17
18
19

20

21
22
23
24

MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.
And because the same argument, I suppose,

could be made for any White House aide, who's acting in accord
with general authority given by a president.
MR. McCREE:

We submit, tc focus on another branch

of government, it's clear that a. judge acting in his judicial
capacity has an absolute immunity.

We suggest that if he

directed a member of the staff of the court,

specifically, to

do something which if he did himself would afford him the abso­
lute immunity, that that person would enjoy an immunity
derivative of him.

The Clerk of the Court', for example.

25

14

1

2

QUESTION:

What kind of derivative immunity have we

allowed to members of the Senate or the Congress?
MR. McCREE:

3

Where the -- in the Gravel case, where

4

the legislator himself would enjoy immunity, if the chief coun­

5

sel of a. committee acted at his direction, he would be protect-

6

ed by the derivative immunity.

7

legislator w-ould not under the Speech or Debate Clause, then

8

neither would the person who acted at his express direction.

9

We contend here that this is specifically within the President's

10

constitutional authority, the areas in which he acted, and that

1 1

he expressly authorized this step to take place.

12
13

think there's any question about that.

QUESTION:

18
19

And therefore, that

MR. McCREE:

he should have, these persons should have a derivative --

If, on the other hand, the

cally, it

I think it should.

I think, analyti­

should, if expressly directed.
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

And the phone company?
Well., the telephone company is out of

the case, Mr. Justice Marshall, and I would prefer to let them
20

speak for themselves if I don't have to.
21

QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, you have mentioned

22

the Speech and Debate Clause.

Does the absence of something

23

similar to it in the Constitution so far as the Executive
24

Branch is concerned have any significance?
25

MR. McCREE:

I don't think so, Mr. Justice Rlackmun.
15

1

although the opinion in this case and the Court of Appeals for

2

the District of Columbia dwelled at some length on the absence

3

of a specific constitutional grant of immunity.

4

the third

5

every judge, justice enjoys an absolute immunity acting in his

6

judicial capacity; but there's nothing in the Constitution that

7

speaks of that.

9

cuting attorney also enjoys an absolute immunity and there's

has

We submit that

no express gerant of immunity, yet

This Court has also decided in Imbler v.

10

nothing in Article II of the Constitution that affords him

1 1

that immunity either.

12

QUESTION:

So we think it's not of consequence -Mr. Solicitor General, I have a vague

13

recollection that Chief Justice Warren addressed this question

14

in some case; that is, the derivative immunity.

15

off the top of your head what case that was?

16

MR. McCREE:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

MR. McCREE:

Do you recall

It may have been the Gravel case.
No, he wasn't here then.
He would not have been -- that would

have been after.
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

Well, no matter.
1 do not.

No matter.

It may occur to me, and if

it does, I would like the privi].ege of calling it to the Chief
Justice's attention.
We also suggest that even if the Court should decide
that petitioners are entitled only to a qualified immunity,
16

1

they are nevertheless entitled to a qualified immunity as a

2

matter of law.

3

when two elements are satisfied:

4

absence of malice or bad faith: and second, there must be an

5

objective test that the conduct is reasonable, that there was r o

6

settled

7

violation.

8
9

or

Qualified immunity occurs, as we understand it,
first, there must be the

clearly established law relating to the alleged

Now, the Court here did riot hold that there was
malice or bad faith.

The Court instea.d claimed that there was

clear established law violated which we contend, and we believe

1 1

we demonstrate in our brief, is erroneous.

12

1969 when the.se taps , were established, it was far from being

13

clear and established what the requirement was , either for

14

warrants or reasonableness in rational security wiretaps.

15

We submit that in

As a matter of fact, it was only tw'o years before

16

these wiretaps were initiated that this Court first held that

17

electronic surveillance was covered by the Fourth Amendment,

18

and the first case to impose a warrant requirement for

19

electronic surveillance of this sort was the so-called Keith

20
21

22
23
24

25

case which was decided after the taps were terminated here,
and that concerned surveillance for domestic security, and not
foreign national security surveillance.

And it wasn't until

after that that any court first spoke to the question of the
application of the Fourth Amendment to the national service
surveillance for foreign security purposes.
17

1

And as this Court itself said in the Keith case,

it was addressing a matter which had never been addressed be­

10

Wasn't that the new

question?
MR. McCREE:

That's correct.

Well, but that's in­

12

volved in this case, too.

We're just saying that the law was

13

14

reasonableness from criminal cases, and apply it.

2

For example, I ssy it without knowing this to be the

3

fact, but I believe that there is a basis for it, that we may

4

be conducting national security wiretaps that have had several

5

years' duration, in some areas; and it may be reasonable in the

6

context of foreign surveillance for national security reasons.

7

Whereas to conduct surveillance for a criminal law purpose of

8

a domestic person, might be unreasonable if it's more than a

9

matter of a few days.

And so we submit that this is an

10

evolving area of the law, and that it certainly isn't settled

1 1

or clearly established lav?, and that the court below erred in

12

asserting that it was, in denying even a qualified immunity,

13

which it would have in the absence of malice, and in the ab­

14

sence of bad faith, in the absence of violation of clearly

15

established law.
We also suggest that, as

16

Butz v. Economou suggested,

17

the Doctrine of Qualified Immunity is not rigid, it's also an

18

evolving doctrine, being a court-made doctrine.

19

varies with the scope; of discretion and responsibility of the

20

office.

And that it

And although the form it took in Butz v. Economou

was a bad faith, the existence of bad faith or the violation
of settled or clearly established. law, we suggest that for the
President and his closest advisors, a much more useful formu­
lation of qualified immunity would, eliminate the. subjective
element of bad faith, or malice, and hold only the objective

25

19

1

test of a violation of settled or clearly established law.

2

And we suggest this for the following reason.

This

3

would permit a court to determine the question of damages

4

liability as a matter of law, and make unnecessary the depos­

5

ing of the President and his closest aides, the submission to

6

them of interrogatories to answer, and possibly the necessity

7

of trial.

8

violation of settled or clearly established law which could be

9

determined objectively would cux^b the kinds of excesses that

And still it would afford protection, becetuse any

10

this Court should be concerned about in balancing the right

1 1

of the citizen

12

entire nation in the conduct of the: office of the President,

13

which we. submit is seriously undermined by either the absence

14

of an absolute immunity or the fa.ilure to construct the kind

15

of qualified immunity thett he might have, which could be de­

16

termined as a matter of law rather than as a matter of fact.
Finally, we argue that judicial, decisions establish­

19

20
21

22
23
24

to recompense against, the interest of the

ing constitutional standards for1 national security surveillance
which were announced after the Halperin wiretap should not be
applied retroactively to permit an award of personal damages
for federal officials.

Clearly, those decisions are all

subsequent to the termination of the tap on Dr. Halperin's
phone, and y^et the Court of Appeals applied them retroactively,
mistakenly, we believe, under the standards expressed in
Chevron.

25

1

The standards in Chevron were three.

The first was

2

whether the new rule was foreshadowed by existing law, or whe­

3

ther it established an overruling of a longstanding’precedent.

4

And we suggest that this Court's opening language in the Keith

case indicates that this certainly is not an ai’ea that was

6

foreshadowed.

7

is whether it serves the purpose of the new rule.

8

of the; new rule, as we; understand it, is to deter conduct, and

To begin with

Petitioner Kissinger, our case against
Indeed, our case against any
In

Our case against Petitioner Kissinger is based on
his role in selecting Morton Halperin as a surveillance target.
I believe the Solicitor Genera] misspoke when he said that
FBI Director Hoover assembled the list of wiretap targets.
In fact, the list was assembled by Dr. Kissinger at the
22

1

National Security Council, that put Halperin on the list to be

2

wiretapped.

3

despite the fact that Dr. Kissinger knew that Halperin did not

4

have access to the information related to the B-52 bombing

5

story, which was the leak that triggered the wiretaps.

6

fact, Dr. Kissinger also knew that Mr. Halperin had very little

7

access to the», information which appeared in previous leaks.

He put Halperin on the list to be wiretapped

And in

In fact, when Dr. Kissinger asked his aide, General

8
9

Haig, to prepare a list of people who had access to the B-52

10

bombing story, Haig did not put Halperin's name on the list,

1 1

but instead, at Kissinger's direction, Halperin's name was put

12

on the list and it was transmitted over to the FBI.

MR. LYNCH:

18

21

22

Well, it was Colonel Haig

Furthermore, with respect tc our case against
Kissinger, it is based on his role in keeping the wi.retap on.
There were a number of instances when the FBI suggested that
the wiretap be taken off, in the very early days, because it
was not revealing any indication that Halperin was a leaker.
Yet, Kissinger persisted through Haig in keeping a tap on
Halperin.

I'm sorry.

at that time, and later he was promoted to general.

16

17

That was Colonel Haig at that time?

6

7

indication that Halpirin is a leaker, we should keep his wire­

8

tap on for at least two more weeks to establish a pattern of

9

innocence.

And -there is one

So he was very directly involved.

And the testi­

10

mony from the FBI officials indicates that they regarded

1 1

Kissinger as the person who would put the taps on, and indeed

12

make the decisions to take the taps off.
There is also testimony from Attorney General

13
14

Mitchell that Kissinger was the person who had the authority

15

to finger targets and to decide when it was time to take them

16

off.

MR.

LYNCH:

The actual logs were kept at the FBI and

summaries were made, and sent over to the White House.

Early

in the surveillance Haig went to Sullivan's office and liter­
ally sat down and read the logs.

25

24

Sullivan also testified at

1

one point Kissinger came over to read the log.

2

disputes that; we're not sure. This is all on summary judgment

But later on this took too much of Haig's time to

come over and read the log so the FBI began preparing summary

letters and sending them over to the White House.

On May 12, 1970, Nixon met with Hoover.

This was

the height of the controversy over the President's decision
to insert troops into Cambodia.

Hoover prepared a brief of

the highlights of the surveillance that had been gleaned in
the two weeks since the Cambodian invasion decision, and he
reviewed those with the President at this meeting.
With respect to Halperin, the highlights of the sur­
veillance included the information that Halperin planned to

resign his consultant status with the National Security

Council in order tc protest the invasion; that Halperin planned

to go to work for Senator Fulbright to work against the war:

organization to oppose the war.

MR. LYNCH:

They want to -That's what we're talking about?
That's right.

Turning to the policy

rationale for the qualified immunity applying to the President,

6

which is the position we urge, in favor of qualified immunity,

7

of the policies which this Court recognized in Butz v.

8

Eoonomou, the first, of all is the importance of enabling a

9

citizen to recover for the violation of his constitutional

10

rights.

11

undertaking actions which violate the constitutional rights of

12

citizens.

13

Secondly is the interest in deterring officials from

And in Butz the Court stressed that the higher an

14

executive official is, the greater his power and the greater

15

his capacity to inflict harm, and therefore the need for deter­

16

rence is correspondingly great.

17

analysis that the deterring interest is at its peak when you're

We submit that under thaH

dealing wi1 h the President, because he of course is the chief
executive officer with tiie greatest degree of wherewithal to
inflict harm on people.
And third, and most fundamentally, the principle that
in this country no man is above the law, and al] executive
officers should have to face suit if in fact they clearly
have, engaged in a violation of constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

But you seem to concede that judges are

above the law.

nity.

LYNCH::

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, they're not above:

They're in an area -- yes, they have absolute immu­

I don't want to quibble about that.

5

But the policy justification for that is much differ­

6

ent.

As the Court said in Butz, the cluster' of immunities that

7

attach to participants in the judicial process arises from the

8

nature of the judicial process.

9

and above all, errors are generally correctable on appeal.

It's open, it's adversarial,

10

And therefore the balance has been struck in favor of absolute

11

immunity.
Whe:n you're dealing with, the executive branch, fre­

12

13

quently the actions are not open, and when you're dealing with

14

violations of constitutional rights, there is no appeal.

15

Mr. Justice Harlan said in Bivens, for people in the Halperin

16

shoes, it's, damages or nothing.
Against these interests, the Government identifies

17

18
19

a number of countervailing interests which in our view are not
sufficient to alter the balance that was struck.

QUESTION:

lic if you were trying to decide whether you were going to take:

3

some particular military action or diplomatic sanction against

4

another country?
MR.

5

6

LYNCH:

No, generally that has to be conducted

privately.
QUESTION:

7

So that, while all of our proceedings

8

and all other judicial proceedings can be conducted in the

9

open, you concede that all the executive functions cannot be

10

in the open?
MR.

1 1

LYNCH:

Thai 's right.

And that's one of the

12

distinctions between executive and judicial proceedings that

13

argues against absolute immunity for executive officers.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR.

LYNCH:

does it not also argue equally for?
Well, I think if you're worried about

16

the disclosure of state secrets, for example, that privilege

17

is absolute, and if a damage claimant runs into a properly

So those interests will be pro­

The principal countervail!ng interest which

That was a question, whether he was deal­

it was a very violent

as an insurrection, I may have overspoke on that.
QUESTION:

7
8

Whether it could be legally defined

Do you consider that comparable to deal­

ing with some of our active adversaries in the world?
MR.

9

LYNCH:

No, I think the President, because the

10

President’s responsibility in dealing in foreign policy is

1 1

even more, complex, more difficult to put your finger on the

12

optimum right course, as Judge Leventhal called it, the

13

President's immunity is very great at that level.

14

the point, where as I was speaking with Mr.

15

was probably alive with absolute immunity, as a practical

16

matter.

QUESTION:

Mr.

And gets to

Justice Stevens, i1

Lynch, let's think about World Weir II.

Assume that President Roosevelt had reason to believe that one
of his personal staff members who was conscientiously opposed
to any war was leaking information with respect to military
operations.

Would the President's efforts to locate or iden­

tify that individual be political, as I think your argument
suggests, or would they be in connection with national security
and foreign policy?
MR.

LYNCH:

If it was -- if the effort was solely to

25

40

1

identify the source of the leak during World War II, I would

2

say that’s a national security foreign policy problem.

3

the wiretaps continued for 21 months and no information, no

4

evidence of leaking had come in, then you'd begin to suspect

5

that the purpose had shifted.

6

QUESTION:

7

So the purpose could shift, even though

it started out quite properly, could it?
MR.

8
9

But if

LYNCH:

That's entirely possible.

And the theory

of our case depends very heavily, as the Court of Appeals

10

recognized, on the various time sequences over this 21-month

1 1

period.

12

the first week.

13

strong good faith showing at that point.

14

to the end of the 21 months, we think we should have a much

15

easier time to recover, assuming we get ever this absolute

immunity hurdle.

The petitioners may be able to make a very

One of the other interests that the Government

It may be in fact very difficult for us to recover for'

has identified as militating in favor of an absolute immunity
is the artfulness, or the danger of artful pleading, and the
fact that the President will be ensnared in insubstantial
lawsuits.

Again, this is, the empirical evidence does not

support this argument, and in this case we have very solid
evidence to support our claims, and I think it's worth noting
that Judge Gesell in his concurrence propiosed a higher stan­
dard for a plaintiff's overcoming summary judgment, while he
41

1

advocated that higher standard he certainly didn't suggest tha1

2

we hadn't met it in this case.

3

The courts in our view have such, the district courts

4

have such great discretion in the timing and scheduling of

5

suits that they can use their ingenuity and the flexibility

6

that's vested in them under the Federal Rules to make accommo­

7

dations fcr the President's time, so that if you get one of

8

these situations where the President is deeply involved in a

9

clear violation of constitutional rights and it is necessary tc

10

procure

his.

evidence, that can he done with a minimum of

1 1

imposition on his time.
If contrary to our submission the Court decides that

12
13

absolute immunity is appropriate for the President, we of

14

course urge the Court to reject the contention that the peti­

15

tioners Kissinger, Mitchell, and Haldeman enjoyed derivative

16

immunity.

17

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

If the Court

were

to

accept

this doctrine

it would substantially erode the system of deterrence that
the Court has sought to foster in Butz.

In other words, if

the President is free tc violate constitutional rights with
impunity, it's essential and absolutely important that his
associates be constrained from doing so.
I think, unless the Court has further questions, I
don't have anything further I need to say,
