ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. FREY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

please the Court:
One of the criticisms most frequently leveled against

11

the operation of the federal criminal justice system concerns

12

the manner in which sentences are meted out to persons con­

13

victed of crime.

14

These criticisms focus on the nearly unbridled dis­

15

cretion that is currently afforded a single individual, the

16

district judge.

17

tion, gross disparities may frequently occur in the sentences

18
19
20

As an almost inevitable result of this discre­

handed out to similarly situated offenders for comparable
criminal conduct.

These disparities adversely affect the pub­

lic perception of the fairness of the administration of criminal
justice and they also engender understandable bitterness on the

21

part of those defendants who receive harsh sentences when they
22

look at others similarly situated who have received much more
23

lenient ones.
24

There is, in sum, a widespread feeling that something
25
3

1

2
3
4
5

should be done to deal with this problem of unequal sentencing.
Now, one obvious means of accomplishing this goal is a system
of appellate review of sentences.

In fact, the adoption of such

a system is one of the principal reforms proposed in the pending
Criminal Code revision.

6

QUESTION:

Where does that stand now, Mr. Frey?

7

MR. FREY:

Well, I believe it's passed the Senate and

8

I'm not sure that it's passed the House.

9

or may not get passed during the lame duck session after the

10

election.

11
12

17
18
19

So you are sure that it hasn't passed the

MR. FREY:

Well, I am sure that if it passes the

House and the Senate that Conference will be required --

I am told that it may

QUESTION:

But it hasn't passed the House at this

MR. FREY:

I believe it hasn't passed the House yet.

point?

Now, under the Senate version of the bill, there would
be a sentencing commission.

And this commission would estab­

lish ranges of sentences for various offenses.

And when the

20

district court went to sentence it would have the unfettered
21

discretion to sentence within those guidelines.

But if it im­

22

posed a sentence above the guideline, the defendant would have
23

a right to appeal and if it imposed a sentence below the guide­
24

line, the Government would have a right to appeal.
25

4

And in

1

2
3

either case the judge would have to make a statement of reasons
for departing from the guidelines, and those reasons would be
subject to review for abuse of discretion.

4

QUESTION:

Are you bringing this material up because

5

you feel that an affirmance here would jeopardize the whole

6

concept of appellate review of sentencing?

7

MR. FREY

Absolutely.

Certainly an affirmance based

8

on the decision of the Second Circuit would cast in serious

9

doubt the validity of the proposed approach.

10

QUESTION

11

appeal under 3576?
MR. FREY:

12
13
14

Incidentally, is this the first Government

It is the first appeal of a sentence it-

self as distinct from the determination of the Court not to
treat a particular defendant as a dangerous special offender.

15
16
17
18

QUESTION:

And when was 3 57 6 adopted?

MR. FREY:

I think it was 1970.

QUESTION:

Was it that far back?

MR. FREY:

I believe so.

In what year?

Now, I think -- it is my

view that the constitutional power of Congress to adopt this
19

kind of reform is likely to depend on the disposition of this
20

case.

Now, it's true that an affirmance of the Court of Appeals

21

would not prevent Congress from allowing defendants to appeal
22
sentences that are considered excessive, but I think it's
23

apparent that this will not solve the problems created by a
24

perception of irrational sentencing discrepancies because those
25

5

1

are equally a product of undue leniency as of undue severity.
2

QUESTION:

One problem that bothers me is, Mr. Frey, is

3

all of the procedures that -■t some of them perhaps have never be
4

held to be constitutionally required; others at least impli­
5

citly have -- that attend the original sentencing, such as
6
7

allocutions and probation reports and so on, none of those
apparently is available in the appellate court.-

8
9

MR. FREY:

Well, I'm not sure the statute does not

speak to that, but of course what we are talking about in the

10

Court of Appeals under this statute is not a de novo sentencing

11

proceeding but an appellate review.

12

QUESTION:

No, but it's an increased sentence, and --

13

MR. FREY:

Well, my view --

14

QUESTION:

-- what everyone calls it, and I -- let's

15

accept your statement that it's not a de novo sentencing pro­

16

ceeding but it could be an increase from ten years to 30 years

17

and it's --

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. FREY:

Yes.

In my view, Mr. Justice Stewart,

QUESTION:

When one thinks that a sentence generally

I --

has been surrounded by all sorts of procedures in the trial
courts such as presentence investigation, allocution, the
demeanor of the defendant during the trial, and all those var­
ious things -MR. FREY:

Well, there are elements -6

QUESTION:
these things.

None of these is available in the Court of

Appeals, is it?

4
5

-- and Rule 11, which incorporates some of

MR. FREY:

I think it's generally true that a hearing

on a suppression motion also has many protections which are not

6

available when the Court of Appeals reviews it, but there is an

7

allocation of function to the extent a sentence may properly be

8

based on the demeanor, on the statements of the defendant, aid

9

allocution.

I think those would, those considerations --

10

QUESTION:

-- would be in the record.

11

MR. FREY:

-- would essentially — No, but to the ex­

12

tent its based on things that the Court of Appeals doesn't have

13

before it, I think those factors would be unreviewable.

14

the Court of Appeals finds that there is a legal error -- let

15
16
17

19

But if

us say, for example that the District Court decides that hearsay
is not to be considered and therefore it says, I would have sen­
tenced you to 25 years had I considered this information about
your organized crime connections, but I don't believe I can con­
sider it, and therefore I will only sentence you to five, then
that would be --

20

QUESTION:

And that would be a legal error.

MR. FREY:

— a pure legal error.

21

Or if a judge said,

normally I would give you a very severe sentence, but because

7

It might

be an unconstitutional legal error.

MR. FREY:

It would be an abuse of discretion, a legal

error, however, that I think could perfectly well be reviewed

by an appellate court.

Well, then it wouldn't be a Government

Now, it's not my job today to persuade this Court

10

that prosecution appeals of sentences are a good policy, because

11

that decision in the case of the dangerous special offender

12

statute has been made by the Congress after careful study of the

13

problem, and what this Court has to decide is whether the

14

Double Jeopardy Clause bars Congress from implementing such a

15

policy even though Congress has determined it to be in the pub­

16

lic interest.

17

In the present case, respondent was convicted of vio­

18

lation of the Rico statute as a result of his role in an arson-

19

for-hire ring.

20
21

22

Because of his extensive criminal record and

his major role in the ring, the Government invoked the provi­
sions of the dangerous special offender statute, and after a
hearing before the district court, findings were entered which
included the following, and I read from page 43 of the appendix:

23

"This criminal history of the respondent, based upon proven
24

facts, reveals a pattern of habitual and knowing criminal conduct

This is material.

What is there at the hearing on

MR. FREY:

Well, there is information relating to

any witnesses at all.
MR. FREY:

No, there are not witnesses.

QUESTION:

That's right.

MR. FREY:

And there was no -- but this was in essence

stipulated to, and his status as a special offender was predi­

10

Is there anything in the sentencing hearing

that could not have been put into the original trial in the
original sentence?
MR. FREY:

Yes.

Well, the original trial before a

jury, it would be prejudicial to put in.
QUESTION:

Well, the original sentencing was before

the same judge.
MR. FREY:

No, no; no, no.

There was no previous sen-

tencing of this defendant prior, on these charges prior to the
dangerous special offender.

He was tried before Judge Pratt in

connection with -QUESTION:

How come he gave him ten years?

MR. FREY:

He was tried before Judge Pratt in connec-

tion with the so-called Columbus Day Bombings in Rochester.
24

He was convicted by Judge Pratt and he was given nine years for
25

10

1

the offenses related to that.

QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

MR. FREY:

He was tried before Judge Burke on the

racketeering charges involving the arson-for-hire ring. He was
convicted.

Then this hearing was held before the Court under

6

the dangerous special offender statute, which was a special

QUESTION:

That's what I thought; after that trial.

9

MR. FREY:

After that trial.

10

QUESTION:

At which time he could put all of this in

11

And at that trial he could have gotten 40 years, couldn't he?
MR. FREY:

He could have gotten -- well, there is a

4

QUESTION:

Well, isn't it -- you could have gotten 40?

5

MR. FREY:

Well, that would depend on the answer to

12
3

question.

6

the question whether the Rico conspiracy and the Rico substan­

7

tive offense are separate offenses where the enterprise that's

8

alleged is an association in fact.

9

could have gotten 40 years.

20
21

I'm not certain that he

But in any event --

What was the maximum he could have gotten?

the Rico conspiracy and the Rico substantive offense carry 203

clear.
In fact,

what he got was ten years concurrent with the sentences in the
bombing charges, so in effect what he got as a result --

11

QUESTION:

-- was one year --

12

MR. FREY:

-- of the arson ring was one year in addi-

13
14

tion to sentences he already was required to serve.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, under your understanding of the

15

appeal procedure, if the trial judge makes an error of law that

16

the Court of Appeals wants to reverse and does reverse, may the

17

Court of Appeals remand for a second sentencing hearing?

18

MR. FREY:

The statute authorizes it; yes.

19

QUESTION:

Does that create any -- well --

MR. FREY:

Well, I don't believe that would create a

20
21

22
23
24

constitutional problem because I don't believe -- I think it is
clear, for instance, that if you had a post-trial suppression
hearing which -- and the evidence was suppressed as in Ceccolini
and the Government appealed and the appellate court concluded
that further hearings were required and a remand to clarify

25

12

1

certain
2
3
4
5

points,

I

think the Court of Appeals could do that

and a further hearing could be held.

Now, it is true that in

the present case we are not challenging any finding of fact, we
are not asking for any further hearing.

We are seeking purely

an appellate-type proceeding and not a second trial if you are

6

going to equate the sentencing with the trial.

7

stronger for us, although I believe that a remand hearing would

8

be permissible under the Double Jeopardy Clause.

9

get to these arguments.

10

11

QUESTION:

So this case is

We'll try to

But the statute permits the appellate court

on the Government's appeal to impose a different sentence?
MR. FREY:

12

It permits the appellate court on either

13

the Government's or the defendant's appeal to impose a differ­

14

ent sentence.

15

QUESTION:

Or to remand?

16

MR. FREY:

Or to remand for further proceedings.

17

QUESTION:

And, just in a word, why do you think

18
19
20

another sentencing proceeding doesn't infringe on the Double
J eopardy?
MR. FREY:

Because I think what the Double Jeopardy

Clause prevents the defendant from being required to do is to be
21

tried again after he's been acquitted.
22

QUESTION:

I guess then it's for the same reason

23

that would permit the Government appeal in the first place?
24

MR. FREY:

I think it's not --

25

13

1
QUESTION:

the sentence is not final

2
MR. FREY:

The sentence is not final.

QUESTION:

-- until the Court of Appeals --

MR. FREY:

This is a kind of -- if jeopardy is in­

3
4
5

volved at this point, if it hasn't terminated with the verdict
6

of guilty, this is a kind of continuing jeopardy theory.

7

8
9

QUESTION:

The sentence of the district court, then,

is not final until the time to appeal has expired or until the
Court of Appeals has reviewed it.

10

11

MR. FREY:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Now that you've been interrupted, Mr. Frey,

12

I notice that the bracketed material on the bottom of the

13

second paragraph of what you read to us on page 43 of the

14

appendix, you say that that phrase was printed in the findings

15

but a line had been drawn through it by hand.
MR. FREY:

16

I take it it's fair to conclude that there

17

was some inconsistency in Judge Burke's findings and his sen­

18

tencing.

19

Appeals would have to consider in the event we --

20
21

22
23
24
25

Indeed, that would be the part of what the Court of

QUESTION:

In your submission the bracketed material

ineluctably followed from what he said.
MR. FREY:

That would be our position, and that his

findings were amply supported by -QUESTION:

And since on the other hand he ultimately

determined not to give a longer sentence, he or somebody under

14

1
his direction , presumably, scratched that out.

3
4

not a dangerous special offender.

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FREY:

We would have a right to appeal the ques­

tion, whether that determination was supported.

8
9

But we would, under the statute, we would

have a right to appeal if he's determined that respondent was

7

FREY:

QUESTION:

So it's -- here it's sort of ambiguous.

He seemed to have determined it but he didn't with the obvious

10

he scratched out the inevitable conclusion from that determina

11

tion.
MR. FREY:

12

I do believe that the consequences of all

13

that would be a problem for the Court of Appeals if it has

14

jurisdiction to entertain our appeal, and not a problem that

15

should delay this Court in its consideration of the case.
QUESTION:

16

And you're -- it's your point that the

17

only question before us is, did the Court of Appeals have juris

18

diction to entertain the appeal?

19
20

21

MR. FREY:

To entertain the appeal; that's correct.

QUESTION:

Nothing as to the merits of the appeal?

MR. FREY:

Nothing as to the merits.

QUESTION:

Is there any doubt whatever that on the

We are not

asking -22

record in this case the bracketed material is fully supported?
24

MR. FREY:

I don't think it's any help in this Court.

I think it will be helpful to us in the Court of Appeals.

Is there any doubt that that is

may wish to argue the contrary, but our position is that it's
amply supported by the record that shows an extended career of

QUESTION:

But your first position is, as I under­

stand it, that that's not a matter for us to determine.

Well, I guess my colleague will probably --

It's not a matter for you to determine;

absolutely.

QUESTION:

We don't have to reach a --

13

MR. FREY:

Now, before I begin with my main legal

14

argument, I'd like to point out that there are three articles

15

that have either just come out or about to come out that the

16

Court may find helpful, dealing specifically with the DiFran-

17

cesco case.

18

of the American Criminal Law Review.

by Ron Stern, starts at Volume 18, page 51.

20

Two of them appear in the December, 1980, edition
The first one, which is

out, and that one supports the Government's case.

By Ronald Stern, did you say?

MR. FREY:

Ronald Stern, your former law clerk.

QUESTION:

My former law clerk?

supports the Court of

appeals.

Mr. Stern's agrees with our position.

QUESTION:
doesn't he?

He did.

MR. FREY:
now.

He works for the Department of Justice,

No, he did but he is in private practice

There is also an article by Professor Weston in the June,

myself and to opposing counsel and to the Court, and I under­

9

treatment of this problem.

10

It's a fairly lengthy

Now, we're dealing here with the constitutionality of

11

an Act of Congress.

12

burden is on those who attack the statute to demonstrate how it

13

offends the policies of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

14

to me that there are three possible objections.

15
16
17
18
19

And, of course, it's our position that the

It seems

The first is that the appeal itself constitutes an
impermissible second jeopardy.

The second is that the Double

Jeopardy Clause vests the defendant with the right to have his
sentence treated with the same kind of finality as an acquittal
would be treated.

And the third is the argument that an in­

crease of the sentence on appeal constitutes a form of multiple
20

punishment that's prohibited by Double Jeopardy concepts.
21

Of course, we believe that none of these objections to Govern­
22

ment sentence appeals is well-founded.
23

The first objection relates, I think, to the notion
24

that the defendant should be spared the expense and anxiety and
25

17

1
uncertainty of a proceeding that may result in an increase of

2
3
4
5

his sentence, a second proceeding after the original sentencing
proceeding.

Of course, as I have mentioned, in this case at

least the second proceeding is not at all like that but it is
o.n appeal argued by lawyers which the defendant does not even

6

attend and which is limited to a review of the record made in

7

the district court.

8
9

The second difficulty with this argument that the
appeal itself is something which a defendant has protection froir

by the Double Jeopardy Clause is that it's well settled by the

11

decisions of this Court such as Wilson and Scott that the Double

12

Jeopardy Clause doesn't protect against appeals as such.

both Wilson and Scott the defendant had won a dismissal of the

charges which would have made him a free man, and in each case

the appeal threatened to jeopardize that and cause the rein­

statement of a conviction or possibly even a second trial.
The appeal entailed, it seems to me, precisely the same degree
of ordeal and anxiety and expense as the appeal that would be
entailed in this case, and yet the Double Jeopardy Clause was
not offended.

20

What is offended by an appeal, if anything, is the
21

relief that the Government requests.

That is, let's say, a new

22
trial following an acquittal.

Of course, if the Government is

23

requesting relief that it is not entitled to have, then there
24

would be no case or controversy before the appellate court.
25

18

But it is the relief itself and not the appeal.

The appeal is

2
not a second jeopardy that the Constitution bars.

whether a sentence is like an acquittal, let me briefly turn to

the question of multiple punishment.

on the anxiety interest and so forth on the appeal thing, it
just ran through my mind, taking the language of the Double Jeoparty Clause, jeopardy of life or limb and so forth -- rather

strong language, am I correct in assuming that if we accept your

argument we would also -- because it's a constitutional provi­

it.

And I have to admit that I simply don't understand

The Government appeal in this case raises the question of

25
20

1

the proper single punishment for respondent's offense.
2
3
4
5

The

issue is not at all like the issue in cases like Whalen or
Jeffers where the defendant received two sentences and the
claim was that there was only one offense.

It's not at all like

the seminal case of Ex parte Lange where the defendant received

6

two sentences

7

in addition the problem that was involved in the companion case

8

in North Carolina against Pearce, he received one five-day sen­

9

tence and one one-year sentence, although the statute only

10

11

when only one was permitted by the statute, and

allowed one year.
Now, there is, of course, the dictum in the United

12

States against Benz, and I am not sure how to explain that

13

except to say that the dictum is clearly based on Ex parte

14

Lange; it contains no independent explanation of the source of

15

its conclusion.

16
17
18
19

We have no difficulty with the conclusion that

there is a multiple punishment problem in Ex parte Lange.
And, of course, neither Benz nor Ex parte Lange dealt
with the question of Government appeals of sentences, but they
both dealt with the question of the trial court calling the
defendant back and changing the sentence.

20

Now, there might be a problem with the trial court
21

having imposed the sentence and a few weeks later saying, I've
22

changed my mind, I'm calling you back, but that is not the issue
23

that we have.
24

And another peculiarity of the Benz issue is that it
25

21

1

apparently applies only if the defendant has begun serving his
2
3
4
5

6
7
8
9

sentence.

But if the defendant is on bail, apparently under

this rule his sentence can be increased.

Now, that doesn't make

very much sense to me, and particularly in light of the require­
ment that he be given credit for time served.

And of course, on

the Government's appeal, any sentence that's imposed by the
Court of Appeals would have to under Simpson against Rice give
credit for the time served.
It doesn't make any sense to say that it turns on

10

whether or not the defendant has begun serving his sentence.

11

I think that matter was a judge-made nonconstitutional rule

12

dealing with the power of the district court to call somebody

13

back for resentencing.

14

power to overrule any such principle as long as it's not of

15

constitutional dimensions.

16

And of course Congress would have the

Now then, we have the third and what to my mind is

17

probably the only substantial argument that can be made in sup­

18

port of the decision of the Court of Appeals and that's the

19

20
21

contention that the imposition of a sentence constitutes in
effect an implied acquittal of any higher sentencing.

Therefore

the defendant's interest in the finality of that sentence would
be comparable to his interest in an acquittal.

22

I think the best statement of this position is Justice
23

Harlan's dissent in North Carolina against Pearce on this point,
24

but I note that the Court did not accept that position and I
25

22

1
further note that the position would not necessarily apply to

2
Government appeals.

There was nothing wrong with the first sen­

3

tence in North Carolina against Pearce and therefore an argument
4

could have been made and was made by Justices Harlan and Douglas
5

that there was no adequate justification for depriving the de­
6
7

fendant of what he had acquired at the first trial, which was a
ceiling on his sentence.

8
9

Now here we are talking about a case in which it's the
Government's contention that there's something legally wrong

10

with the sentence that was initially imposed and that the Govern'

11

ment should be entitled to correct it.

12

contrary decision rests on a mistaken impression, as I've said

13

before, about the relationship of the Double Jeopardy Clause

14

to the defendant's finality interests.

15

are not generally protected against the Government appeal but

16

are protected only where the relief that the Government seeks is

17

to set aside an acquittal and have a retrial.

20

21

22
23
24

Those finality interests

This point can be made clear by comparing Pearce with

18
19

The Court of Appeals'

Green.

In Green there was an implied acquittal of a greater

offense and the prosecution was barred from retrying the defen­
dant for that offense.

In Pearce there was arguably an implied

acquittal of a greater sentence and the prosecution was not
barred.
Similarly, in Bozza against the United States, the
Court held that the correction of an illegal sentence to increas e

25

23

1

it to minimum legal requirements was permissible under the
2
3
4
5

6
7

Double Jeopardy Clause, but an illegal dismissal or acquittal
entered by the judge in Fong Foo before the Government had
barely begun the presentation of its evidence was held not
reviewable.

Now, what this suggests is that there is for Double

Jeopardy purposes a recognized and substantial difference be­
tween the finality interest that a defendant has in an acquittal

8

and the finality interest that a defendant has in his sentence,

9

just as there are differences for Due Process purposes between

10

the kinds of procedures that must be afforded to a defendant at

11

trial and to a defendant in connection with sentencing.

12

I think I should reserve the balance of my time.

I represent the respondent, Eugene DiFrancesco, who is
serving ten years in this matter in Atlanta.

in response to the remarks of Mr. Frey point out that the
Federal Parole Board now has a severity index scale which they
apply nationwide, which I submit is a much better way to even

22

sentences out.

Now --

23

QUESTION:

But how is that relevant to our problem?

24

MR. NeMOYER:

Well, his first point, as I understood

25

24

1
it, Mr. Chief Justice, was that there's a disparity in sentences.

2
He said the public is complaining about it, it's one of -3

QUESTION:

Well, that's not.

He was just mentioning

4

that that's the genesis of congressional concern that led to
5

the passage of the statute.

6

MR. NeMOYER:
Justice.

That's nothing more than that.

I misunderstood him then, Mr. Chief

In any respect, I think there is now a procedure to

8

even out sentences without an appellate review which has a lot

9

of problems in it.

10

11

QUESTION:

But the Parole Board's power doesn't in­

clude any power to enlarge a sentence, does it?

12

MR. NeMOYER:

13

No, that's true, Judge.

And is it a procedure or just some guide­

MR. NeMOYER:

in the federal parole system, Justice White.

Justice White, I

MR. NeMOYER:

No, this is what happens to a

prisoner after he is incarcerated and it's a leveling nation­

What they seek would only be a leveling circuitwide.

Now, Mr. Frey has made reference to the Senate version --

But it also, however, might lead to some

uniform application of this special offender statute.

MR. NeMOYER:

That's what they're talking about, isn't

it?

MR. NeMOYER:

No, I believe that they're talking --

Well, it's part of what they're talking

about.
MR. NeMOYER:

12

Part of -- yes, Judge.

No question

13

about it.

14

Judge, in the final analysis is they're complaining, occasion­

ally there's too lenient a sentence imposed by some judge and

16

they want the right to appeal it.

17

21

MR. NeMOYER:

Ignoring the statute or they say -- for

example, they think Judge Burke ignored Mr. DiFrancesco's
background.

22
23

A judge's ignoring the statute; that's

what the claim is.

19

But I think what they're complaining about, I think,

When you say "they," you refer to Congress,

But it's the Department that decides whe­

MR. NeMOYER:

That's true, that's true.

Right.

And their claim is that the judge is mis­

applying the statute.

12

that in the particular instance they think the defendant got

13

too lenient a sentence.

Mr. Frey meant when he said there will be a conference.
QUESTION:

Well, it isn't -- no assurance it's going

22

MR. NeMOYER:

No; none at all.

Now, he also read at

23

length, sir, from the findings he said that Judge Burke made.
24

What those are, Justice White, were their findings they
25

27

submitted to Judge Burke.

He signed them, striking the last

2

four lines out.

So when he reads that he's reading, in effect,

what they prepared below, which Judge Burke signed, striking

out, I think, the most significant thing, namely, that the

defendant should be incarcerated for a longer period than pro­

Well, you don't suggest that the judge

just rubberstamped those statements about his past record?
MR. NeMOYER:

Judge, the transcript of the hearing

might be more illuminating, in which they went into all of that

that really mattered -- namely, that "the defendant has to be

felony."

In fact, Justice Rehnquist, I don't know, it might be

like a medical report where you don't read it all, you read the

And I submit that

Judge Burke well could have found, as he indicated at the hear­

knew that he thoughtfully considered that, that is one thing.

14

But I submit two things:

15
16
17

one, he struck out the last part of

the findings; and two, I think the clearest evidence of Judge
Burke's disposition was this sentence that he imposed, which
was clearly less than provided for the underlying felonies.

10

MR. NeMOYER:

Right.

That's our first position. And

11

I might say, in the same vein, Justice Stewart, our second

12

position was that the underlying felonies carry at least 20

13

years, 25 years under 3575, and 40 years under, I think, the

general consensus, which was an ample sentence if Judge Burke

chose to impose it, and he didn't.

I think the issue was never -- the court never addressed itself
to that issue.

MR. NeMOYER:

Now, Justice Stewart's point about the

right of allocution and appeal to the 2nd Circuit,

I think, is

a real problem with this statute.

Rule 32(a)(1) has a right to speak at sentence.

QUESTION:

Of course, Mr. NeMoyer, one of the things

that 35 76 authorizes an appellate court to do on the Government's
appeal is to remand for further sentencing proceedings and
imposition of sentence by the trial court.

And none of the

arguments you are making would question the validity of that
provision of the statute, would it?

None of these things, I submit, would be by and

anything in this case, does it?
MR. NeMOYER:

No.

Well, yes, it does.

I think that

the provision of -- I think it's a clear -- I think the Fifth
Amendment is clear in this area, that they're not permitted to
go and appeal sentence, to twice put the defendant in jeopardy.
And I think it's dead clear, and I submit that's why it has
never been attempted.
QUESTION:

Well, if there's never been any case,

then surely there's no controlling precedent, is there?
MR. NeMOYER:

I think there is no controlling prece­

I think that's correct.

21

I think what's on point is the Fifth Amendment itself.

But I

22

don't -- as far as our position, and I think their position is,
23

there is no case.

Mr. Frey has cited many cases, Judge, but

24

none of them stand for the proposition he is urging this Court

QUESTION:

asking here.

As it is now, when he sentences it has a degree of finality to

I think it somewhat demeans his authority and stature.

Mr. Chief Justice, that it had constitutional problems, and that

19
20

was discussed when it was enacted.

And I'm saying that this

Court I would like to consider these factors.

Congress well

might have considered them, but their viewpoint and this Court's

viewpoint might not necessarily be the same, for some of the

reasons we've stated.

In addition, I submit that permitting in

I submit, Judge, I'm troubled with an Act of Congress directing

the court to do, to make certain written findings, appellate

But in any event, Judge, I submit that it would create

5

an awesome burden to our appellate courts to, one, make them

behest of the Government; make written

findings; review lengthy presentence reports; maybe make some
provision for the defendant to have the right of allocution;

sort of testaments.

It would subject all defendants to an apprehension

regarding their sentences.

They well might have pled guilty

to avoid that apprehension, or they might not have the funds to
go on appeal.

It would subject all trial judges, their deci­

sions regarding sentencing, to review.

It would subject the

circuit courts to making findings.

And if somebody disagreed

20

with those findings, there's only one place they could come,
