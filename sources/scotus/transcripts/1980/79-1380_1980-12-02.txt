ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOTT SCHULDER, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

6

MR. SCHULDER:

7

8

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

9

This case is before the Court on direct appeal from

10

the United States District Court for the Northern District of

11

Illinois.

12

of the Social Security Act violates the equal protection com­

13

ponent of the Fifth Amendment's due process clause by excluding

14

from certain public assistance benefits under the Supplemental

15

Security Income program otherwise eligible individuals who

16

are residents of public institutions and whose care and

17

treatment are not funded under the Medicaid program.

18

to gain a proper understanding of this question, it is neces­

19

sary to explore the interaction of Medicaid and SSI statutes

20

that give rise to the equal protection issue here.

21

22
23
24
25

The question presented is whether Section 1611(e)(1]

In order

Under Medicaid, the federal government provides
financial assistance to those states that choose to reimburse
certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.

The

Medicaid program generally covers in-patient and out-patient
care for physical and mental illnesses, but it excludes
3

1

2
3
4
5

6
7
8
9

coverage for treatment of persons aged 21 through 64, in an
institution for treatment of tuberculosis or mental diseases.
Since Appellees are between 21 and 64 years of age and are
patients in mental institutions, their treatment is not funded
under Medicaid.

The validity of the Medicaid mental insti­

tution exclusion was upheld in this Court's summary affir­
mance in Legion v. Richardson, and Appellees do not challenge
their exclusion from Medicaid coverage in this litigation.
Under the SSI program, which was in effect on

10

January 1st, 1874, the federal government provides monthly

11

cash assistance to indigent, aged, blind and disabled persons.

12

A person is considered disabled within the meaning of the

13

statute if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful

14

activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or

15

mental impairment.

Currently a standard SSI benefit amounts

16

to $238 per month.

-- following up on what Justice Blackmun

No, that's the only cost that was

considered here, but it was done on a, I believe, a nationwide

basis. The class that was certified in this case is limited

Administration.

Do you know how many people are -- have an

MR. SCHULDER:

Well, don't try to --- if

As I was saying, Section 1611(e)(1),

6

the statute at issue here provides for an exclusion from SSI

7

benefits generally, of all persons who are residents in public

8

institutions.

9

$25-a-month benefit for ''comfort items" to those individuals

However, the statute provides that a small,

10

who reside in a medical facility which is receiving a payment

11

under the Medicaid program to pay for the costs of their care

12

and treatment.

13

The purpose of this reduced monthly benefit, as

14

expressed in the legislative history, is to allow the recip­

15

ient to purchase small comfort items, such as magazines,

16

stationery or clothing, not supplied by the institution.

17

statute, the statutory exclusion and exemption at issue here

18

has the effect of denying SSI payments to all residents of

19

public institutions whose treatment, for whatever reason, is

20

not funded under Medicaid.

Appellees brought this lawsuit for declaratory

10

relief on April -- challenging the constitutionality of

11

Section 1611(e)(1) on equal protection grounds.

12

Court, as I mentioned earlier, certified the case as a class

13

action and granted summary judgment for Appellees.

14

District Court first concluded that the statute invidiously

15

discriminates against the mentally ill, it then determined

16

that classifications based on mental illness are sufficiently

17

similar to suspect classifications, such as race or natural

18

origin to require a stricter standard of review than is nor­

19

mally applicable in reviewing social welfare legislation.

20
21

22

QUESTION;

District

The

This Court has never held that mental

illness is a suspect classification, has it?
MR. SCHULDER:

That's correct.

Actually what the

23

District Court held in this case was that mental illness was

24

a quasi-suspect classification and thus entitled to an inter­

25

mediate or heightened level of sci’utiny.
7

The only two federal

1

courts of which I am aware, that have specifically addressed

2

the- question, have held that mentally ill individuals -- or

3

classifications, are not entitled to any kind of heightened

4

or strict scrutiny.

5

We have cited those in our brief.

The District Court ruled in this case that mental

6

health classifications must serve important governmental in­

7

terests and must be substantially related to achievement of

8

those objectives.

9
10

11

QUESTION:

Well that’s pretty much the Boren test,

I guess, isn't it?
MR. SCHULDER:

That's correct.

The Court held that

12

the statute in this case failed to pass muster under this

13

heightened standard.

14

view that the statute appeared to be an accidental by-product

15

of the legislature rather than a deliberate means of serving

16

a legislative end.

17

In addition, the Court expressed the

The case here presents a problem of line-drawing

18

in enactment of social welfare legislation.

19

statutory provision at issue here, Congress drew the line at

20

providing SSI benefits to public institution residents whose

21

treatment was partially funded by the federal government under

22

the Medicaid program, while leaving it to the states and

23

local governments to provide for the comfort needs of public

24

institution residents whose care was wholly funded by state

25

and local government sources.

In enacting the

We submit that the statute is
8

1

rationally based on considerations of conserving economic

2

resources and of respect for the responsibilities of state

3

and local governments for caring for those who are within

4

-- caring for the comfort needs of those within public insti­

5

tutions that are wholly funded by those local governments.
The District Court, however, held that the classi­

6
7

fication at issue here is based on mental health.

We submit

8

that the Court's conclusion that this statute discriminates

9

on the basis of mental health, is incorrect, and in fact the

10

Court's conclusion that the

statute discriminates on the basis

11

of mental health ignores the fact that individuals such as

12

Appellees , who are disabled by reason of mental impairment are

13

included within the SSI program in the first place, precisely

14

because their mental condition is severe enough to warrant --

15

to constitute a disability, and to warrant benefits under the

16

SSI program.
Appellees arguments and the conclusions of the Distri ct

17
18

Court, therefore, rest and fall on this tortology.

19

it is important in this case to focus on precisely what kind

20

of -~
QUESTION:

21

Moreover,

I have some difficulty following that

22

argument.

Supposing that they said you are eligible for SSI,

23

one ground would be mental illness, but then they said,

24

however, mentally ill pepole get half the benefits everybody

25

else gets.

They would get in because they are mentally ill,
9

1

but then they only get a lesser benefit.

2

still claim the classification was based on mental illness?

3
4

MR. SCHULDER:

Couldn't they then

But that's not the classification at

issue here.

5

QUESTION:

But I'm just, I'm just directing my

6

question at your point that because they get initial eligi­

7

bility by reason of mental illness, therefore nothing else

8

done by reason of mental illness can be based on mental ill­

9

ness .
MR. SCHULDER:

10

That may be true, that merely because

11

a class of people are included within the statute initially

12

and then not given equal treatment with other beneficiaries,

13

that would not necessarily mean that the statute did not

14

discriminate against them.

15

trying to make here is that the District Court's conclusion

16

that the statute invidiously discriminates against them and

17

the Court's ascribing some kind of antipathetic attitude on

18

the part of Congress toward the mentally ill, simply is un­

19

founded in the context of

20

who are mentally impaired for special treatment and inclusion

21

in the program in the first instance.

22

tory exclusion at issue here does not exclude the mentally

23

ill across the board; in fact, there are large numbers of

24

mentally ill individuals who do qualify for the reduced SSI

25

benefit.

But one of the points that we are

a

statute that singles out people

Well, we're not --

Aren't you saying we didn't discriminate

MR. SCHULDER:

No.

exclusion that we're dealing with here does not single out any

14

one group of individuals.

public institution residents who are receiving Medicaid fund­

Mr. Schulder, let me go at it another

is, and that it is one based in, just in part on mental

illness, that isn't the end of your case, as I understand it?

Suppose you are wrong on the type of classification this

down on this first point.

7

of it.

8
9

No, it certainly would not be.

MR. SCHULDER:

I'd like to hear more on the rest

Okay.

Well, we would argue that if

the SSI exclusionary provision is read together with the Medi­

10

caid eligibility provision that specifically applies to these

11

Appellees, the only factors that are really at issue here are

12

age, and presence in a public mental institution.

13

submit that neither of these two factors require any kind of

14

heightened scrutiny.

15

And we

First of all, this Court held in Massachusetts

16

Retirement Board v. Murgia and Vance v. Bradley, that age is

17

not a factor that requires heightened scrutiny.

18

sence in public mental institutions, the fact that certain

19

individuals may have to go to a public mental institution

20

because of indigency does not require heightened scrutiny, as

21

this Court pointed out in Harris v, McRae.

22

a factor that calls for any kind of heightened judicial review.

23

Similarly, presence in a public mental Institution is

As to pre­

Indigency is not

not an immutable condition determined by accent or birth.

25

Some of Appellees, as the record points out, were voluntarily

committed to public mental hospitals.

2

brief points out on page 28, footnote 12, that the medium

3

length of stay in a mental hospital is 41 days.

4

of that bit of evidence, we submit that presence in a mental

institution certainly Is not an immutable characteristic.

In fact, Appellees

On the basis

benefits to those it was already helping under other programs,

20

such as the Medicaid program here, and it could determine that

21

the needs of these -- of others who are not covered under

22

Medicaid should continue to be met by the states.

23

Appellees argue that the same reasons that support the Medi­

24

caid exclusion that was upheld in Legion do not support the

25

SSI exclusion here.

As we've shown in our
Congress could limit

Now,

But we do not argue that precisely the

same reasons support both exclusions; Medicaid and SSI are

two separate programs.

limiting the exclusion to those within a particular Medicaid

QUESTION:

In enacting the statutory exclusion

The line in this

To say that Congress had to consider a

Do I correctly understand that if

11

Congress did fund the mental institution program with Medicaid,

12

that the government would concede that they could not consti­

13

tutionally deny the mental patients the $25?
MR. SCHULDER:

14
15

Well, under the operation of the

statute -QUESTION:

16

I understand the statute would take care

17

of it, but assume that they have adopted a plan -- with

18

amendment that provided federal funding for mental institutions

19

and for these mental patients, but nevertheless, retained the

20

exclusion of the $25 for these people -- as I understand

21

your argument, that would be unconstitutional and irrational.
MR. SCHULDER:

22
23

an

I believe it probably would be and we

would --

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

So you rest entirely on the fact

25

that the funding is provided

by the states exclusively withoul
15

1

any federal support?

2

MR. SCHULDER:

3
4

5

6

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And does that mean that there is a pre­

sumption that the state is given the equivalent of $25, or
just the mere fact that because it's a different source of
funding, we don't care whether they get the $25?

7

MR. SCHULDER:

I think the latter would be the

8

proper consideration, although the amicus brief filed by the

9

States of New York and Pennsylvania point out that -- at

10

least, the State of New York does provide this type of benefit

1 1

out of its own funds.

12

similarly provide for this benefit.

I'm not sure whether other states

13

In sum, our submission is --

QUESTION:

15
16

here.

Well, that's why New York is against you,

They want to be relieved.
MR. SCHULDER:

That's correct.

That's correct.

17

Our position in a nutshell is that at least where a statutory

18

distinction is based on a neutral factor such as Medicaid

19

eligibility, the classification should be judged on its own

20

terms and not in terms of the specific impact on the various

21

subgroups that happen to be affected by it.

22

Finally, we submit that contrary to the suggestion

23

of the District Court, the statute here is not the product of

24

Congressional inadvertence.

25

that contained the SSI provision at issue here, Congress also

6

The brief of the private psychiatric hospital asso­

7

ciation supports us in our contention that Congress knew what

8

it was doing and knew the impact of what it was doing when it

enacted the statute at issue here.
QUESTION:

10
1 1

Well if Congress inadvertently enacts a

piece of legislation, does that make it unconstitutional?
MR.

12

SCHULDER:

Not necessarily, Justice Rehnquist.

13

In fact, the next thing I was about to say was that if Appel­

14

lees have any problem with the statute and believe that

15

Congress did inadvertently exclude them, then their remedy is

16

with Congress and not with the Courts.

17

I have stated here and we have stated in our briefs, we

18

respectfully submit that the judgment of the District Court

19

should be reversed.

The Supplemental Security Income program is a wholly

indigent, aged, blind and disabled people.

One important

component of that program is this grant of $25-a-month income

maintenance for those people who reside in public or private

6

medical institutions.

7

The government has tried to characterize the program

8

as excluding residents of public institutions generally, and

9

as involving no discrimination at all against the mentally ill

10

But this ignores the broad grant of eligibility to virtually

1 1

all aged, blind and disabled residents of medical institutions

12

whether public or private, and the contrasting special exclus­

13

ionary rules for certain mental institution residents.

14

framework is created by the incorporation of the receipt of

Medicaid as the trigger for SSI eligibility. But under the

Medicaid statute, virtually all residents of medical institu­

In Legion, the Court looked to specific'

That's right.

No dispute.

But it is

Appellees, who are 22 to 64, and in public mental hospitals,
who are excluded from SSI because they are excluded from
Medicaid.
The SSI program, let me first talk a little bit
about the nature of the discrimination.

The government has

argued that this doesn't discriminate at all against the
mentally ill.

We agree

the statute discriminates to some

extent among mental patients as well as against mental patients
but that doesn't alter the nature of the case.

This Court

has frequently considered cases in which statutes discriminated
22

both among and against women, illegitimate children, and aliens
23

But the Court- in each case identified the discrimination --the
24

discriminated group., as aliens, women or illegitimate children.

The statute and the legislative history of the
medical assistance provisions that have been incorporated
into SSI, demonstrates mental health status of Appellees
plays a key role in the discrimination.

The original medical

assistance provisions excluded persons who were diagnosed as
having psychosis and being treated in a medical institution

7

as a result thereof.

8

the current provision, excludes the Appellees from Medicaid

9

because they reside in an institution for mental diseases.

Those provisions have been narrowed sinc^

10

And it is this exclusion that Section 1611(e)(1)(B) incorporat^

1 1

into the SSI statute.

12

mental health status of Appellees is irrelevant to the SSI

exclusion is incorrect.

Thus, the Secretary’s suggestion that

But Congress, I keep returning to the

point that Congress has made a determination here that people
in medical institutions need this grant.

Congress has not said

why residents of mental hospitals aged 22 to 64 as residents
of medical institutions, don't need this grant, that all other
residents of medical institutions get, assuming that they are
aged, blind, disabled and indigent.
23

Okay.

And this denial

1

has occurred not only without the slightest suggestion from

2

Congress of a reason for it, but the Secretary has also not

3

articulated any rational relationship to a legitimate govern­

4

mental interest.

5

Unlike many of the public assistance cases on which

the Secretary relies, in this case Congress did not differen­

basis of a judgment of differing economic need.

In that situation there's no violation

MR. WEILL:

If there were a statute that said any­

body could work on a federal dam except -- they had to be
employed or be a contractor for a federal dam, except women,
or except blacks, or except persons who were in a mental insti
tution within the last ten years; that raises equal protection
questions.

There's an entitlement there and an exclusion from

that entitlement.

Not all federal programs, funding programs,

create the types of entitlement that Social Security and
SSI do.

And in certain circumstances, some exclusions from

those entitlements are subject to equal protection -- become
equal protection violations.
QUESTION:

What sort of entitlement is it that you

that the 30 -- in answer to the first question, Mr. Schulder,

the 30 million dollar estimate is an estimate that the

government made of what the cost would be if every mental

patient in a public hospital aged 22 to 64 in the country got

SSI.

There are about 100,000 such persons, if each person got

question.

The amount of the money, unless the amount is tre­

mendous, as was a factor in Medicaid exclusion, where it

came to billions of dollars a year, money alone has not been

gives some deference to legislative judgments, because the

10
11

QUESTION:

of deference.

MR. WEILL:

does not make line-drawing itself a rational basis for an

exclusion.

that, oh well, Congress drew the line there.

MR. WEILL:

That’s right.
While the Court, the Court could cer­

rational basis for discrimination, if there is one, there are
