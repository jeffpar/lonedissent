MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Grossman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY M. GROSSMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. GROSSMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

This case presents two basic questions.

summarize the nature of the factual backgrounds that give rise
to them.

In essence, Attorney John Risjord represents the

plaintiff in certain personal injury suits against Firestone.
Mr. Risjord's firm also has a long-standing relationship with
the insurance dompany, Home Insurance Company, which insures
Firestone against those very claims.

The record reflects that

for some 20 years Mr. Risjord's firm has represented Home,
the insuror, on a case-by-case basis and throughout that time
has held Home out to the public as its foremost insurance
client by listing it first in a non-alphabetical listing of

25

3

1

2

insurance clients in the Martindale-Hubbell Directory.
In prosecuting his personal injury suits against

3

Firestone, Mr. Risjord has included a theory of intentional

4

tort, and based on that theory Home has disclaimed coverage

5

under its policy.

6

fication, contending that in his management of the personal

7

injury cases he inevitably would be affected, consciously or

8

unconsciously, by his awareness of Home's interest in defeating

9

coverage, and that even if it were assumed that his original

Firestone moved for Mr. Risjord's disquali­

10

selection of that theory of intentional tort weren't prompted

1 1

by Home's interest in determining whether or how aggressively

12

to pursue it, he would necessarily be affected, clouded as it

13

were, in his judgment , because he would know that pursuit

14

theory would be helpful and its abandonment harmful to his

15

firm's longstanding client, Home.
QUESTION:

of that

Mr. Grossman, may I interrupt you for a

moment to ask you a question that doesn't really go to the
merits of this case at all?

In the respondent's brief I notice

on page 2 the second very short, one-sentence paragraph said
that, "Risjord has Filed complaints on behalf of a plaintiff
against Goodyear Tire

£

Rubber Company, alleging identical

21

claims ..."
Now, would a judge who had an interest, legal or
equitable, in Goodyear Tire S Rubber Company, should such a
judge consider disqualifying himself from this litigation?

regard.
The trial court recognized on the undisputed facts

22

MilRisjord did in fact face a conflict of interest, but the
23

court then went on to say, in substance, that he nevertheless
24

could continue to represent the personal injury plaintiffs
25

5

1

against Firestone if he obtained the consent of those plain­

2

tiffs and of Home Insurance Company.

3

Firestone appealed from that determination, contend­

4

ing that not only was this not a situation where a consent

5

approach was really a viable solution, but the trial court's

6

approach to the consent was flawed in any event.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GROSSMAN:

9

Why was it any concern of Firestone's?
Because, Your Honor, Firestone viewed

the matter, or had to view the matter not only in terms of

10

whether the case might be won or lost, but also from the stand­

1 1

point of insurability.

12

Mr. Risjord's conflict of interest on the outcome of the case,

13

it would at the very least create a greater risk that any

14

recovery, even if more remote overall, would more likely be

15

fashioned in a manner to defeat coverage.

16

that would be a gamble that Firestone ought not to be required

17

to take and that even if Firestone were willing to take it

18

21
22
23

And we submit that

the public interest shouldn't permit it.
QUESTION:

19

20

And irrespective of the impact of

Well, let's assume Firestone, for a mo­

ment, doesn't represent the public interest but just itself.
Why is it that Firestone would suffer if he were not disquali­
fied?
MR. GROSSMAN:

Well, assume that -- well, there areat

least three .ways that Firestone would suffer, We would contend.
24

First of all, of course, if in fact his conflict led him to
25

6

1

pursue the case in a way that was guided in terms of insura­
2

bility.

We think that factor would prejudice Firestone be­

3
4

cause they are entitled to have the case presented by ah attor*
ney who is guided by the interest of the plaintiff, not of the

5

insurance carrier.
6

QUESTION:

Would the options open to the plaintiffs'

7

counsel as to insurability or not, affect recovery against
8

Firestone?
9

MR. GROSSMAN:

As I said, they could affect the pros­

10

pect that any recovery might be fashioned in such a way as to
11

12

13
14

15
16

17

avoid coverage under the policy.

burden, I would cite to the Court, and that is that even if
Firestone ultimately prevails on the merits, Firestone could
be prejudiced by being required to defend against claims which
but for Mr. Risjord's conflict of interests would not have
been pursued or if pursued would have been abandoned at an
earlier stage of the proceedings.

Firestone had an action against Home for breach of
Is that action still pending?

MR. GROSSMAN:

That action is still pending,

Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Is it being held for resolution of this

case, or just clogged in the calendar?
MR. GROSSMAN:

No.

It is simply pending in the lower
7

1

court and it has not been set for trial at this time.

2

I might add -- well, excuse me.

3

QUESTION:

Your answer is basically that Firestone

4

might have to pay a greater or lesser amount depending on

5

how much insurability there was in its policy with Home, is

6

that correct?

7

MR. GROSSMAN:

Our position is that Firestone is put

8

at risk because it stands a greater chance that recovery or

9

the prospects of recovery might more likely be guided, or I

10

should say the recovery might more likely be fashioned in such

1 1

a way as to avoid coverage under Home's policy.

12

that's a risk which shouldn't enter into the case.

13

shouldn't face the risk that the case will be guided, not just

14

in terms of the victory of the plaintiff -- that's a risk that

15

they obviously would have to take, but they shouldn't have to

16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23

And we think
Firestone

take the risk that the case would be guided in such a way that
if plaintiff recovers the recovery would be more, likely fash­
ioned in a way that would prejudice the position of Firestone
as against Home on its insurance policy.
QUESTION:

Mr. Grossman, suppose this lawyer had

withdrawn his name and had in turn given all of his plans, all
of his trial briefs, to another lawyer.

Would you have a

complaint against that lawyer?
MR. GROSSMAN:

If he imparted his matters of public

24

record to another lawyer, we would have no quarrel with that.
25

If he handed anything he wanted to him,

seem ordinarily we would not be complaining about that.

And to further answer the question posed by Hr. Justice

in our view would be contrary to

10

Marshall, I would say that we don't feel the question is hypo­

11

thetical, in the sense that it is inevitable

12

that Mr.Risjord being human, knowing of Home's interest, that

his judgment will be clouded by that awareness.

problem we face is that we cannot determine, and really can't

can

clarify

that

its1 own counsel.

matter

The problem here is not

that Home has picked an attorney to represent Firestone, but
rather it's the link between Home and the plaintiff attorney.
And our concern, and I think the reason that the Court ought
to be concerned with that situation, even though it differs
10

1

from the usual case where the insurance company selects an

2

attorney to represent the defendant and the conflict arises in

3

that context, is that where the insurance company is linked to

4

the plaintiff's attorney, number one, he has greater control

5

over the case than does the defendant's attorney; number two,

6

there are two interests at jeopardy, the plaintiffs he repre­

7

sents -- and we submit that the risk toward plaintiffs, for

8

example, ought to be represented by counsel whose judgments

9

are not prompted by divided loyalty.

That may not be Fire­

10

stone's motives, but we believe that their interests coincide

11

with those of Firestone in this instance.
And thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, where

12

13
14

the insurance carrier is linked to the plaintiff in the case
as

in

this

instance, the plaintiff's attorney -- it's

15

much more difficult to police the effect or impact of a con­

16

flict of interest on the myriad of tactical and strategic

17

choices that an attorney like Mr. Risjord is going to make,

18

or will have to make, in the course of the case.

19

20

21
22
23
24

25

And, of course, there's the danger that -- let's
assume that Firestone ultimately attains reversal, there's
still the danger that since a retrial doesn't start with a
really clean slate, that in the interim the proceedings would
have been indelibly painted with acts or omissions of
Mr. Risjord prompted by his concern for Home.
And at this point I'd like to address a question I
11

1

think implicit in a question asked by Mr. Justice Blackmun

2

earlier, and that is the possibility of a suit by Firestone

3

against Home.

4

first of all, that the conflicts question we're concerned with

5

in this instance is really separate from whether or not Home

6

is accountable to Firestone.

The reason we don't feel that's an answer is,

And secondly, we believe the most appropriate place

7

8

to determine the effectiveness of a consent approach which the

9

trial court adopted here is the very proceeding where those

10

consents are relied on -- and Firestone ought not to be rele­

1 1

gated to the vagaries of whatever relief if any it might be

12

able to obtain against Home, given the problems of proving

13

damages, the impact of the action of Home on the outcome, and

14

so on.

15
16

17

18
19

21

Now -QUESTION:

Is your claim abuse of discretion?

MR. GROSSMAN:

We don't believe any discretion was

involved, Mr. Justice Marshall, because the trial court
acknowledged that the conflict existed.
tially undisputed.

The facts were essen­

The trial court erred, or went off base,

so to speak, because it didn't render appropriate redress for
the conflict, and we think in that context -QUESTION:

That it wasn't discretionary?

22

MR. GROSSMAN:

We don't believe that there was any

23

appropriate place for the trial court to exercise discretion
24

in, that situation,.

We don't believe that it was called upon

25

12

1

to exercise discretion in that context, just as we don't be­

2

lieve that this was a case where the trial court has decided

3

any disputed fact issue which might be entitled to deference.

4

It's simply a case where the trial court misperceived the con­

5

sequences of its own findings of fact.
Now, the Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit next

6
7

considered the matter.

8

tion was that the trial court's consent approach was flawed be­

9

cause they looked to the wrong party's consent, and consent

10

And as I mentioned, Firestone's posi­

wasn't viable.

1 1

The Court of Appeals for the.8th Circuit, without

12

hearing argument, only addressed the merits in one sentence

13

in which they stated, in substance, the trial court's action

14

was an abuse of discretion and as I just mentioned, I don't

15

think that really even addressed the problem.
Basically, what that court addressed was the ques­

16
17

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

25

tion of appealability and held in effect that in that circuit
appeals from orders denying disqualification would no longer
lie.
I should mention one other fact.

At the time of the

motion the record reflects that Mr. Risjord was representing
Home in one case, the Cannova case.

Subsequently, he withdrew

from that case and ultimately the case has been disposed of.
Well, we submit that it doesn't really obviate the conflict,
because irrespective of whether Mr. Risjord or his firm are
13

1

representing Home at a given instant, Mr. Risjord would be

2

aware that his firm's potential future business with a long­

3

standing client, Home, could be affected by whether his actions

4

in the personal injury suits against Firestone tend to further

5

or defe'at

Home's efforts to avoid coverage.

6

Now, turning first to a question raised at the out­

7

set, the threshold question of appealability, we contend that

8

not only are the Cohen criteria satisfied but that the treat­

9

ment of appeals of orders denying disqualification as appeal-

10

able would be consistent with sound judicial administration.

1 1

Inasmuch as it's generally conceded that the Cohen

12

criteria of finality and separability are present, the key

13

question is whether the Cohen test of urgency is met.

14

words, do we have a situation in which the appeal can wait

15

until the judgment on the merits of the case or not?

In other

We submit we can't wait, because in the interim the

16

17

parties and the public interest will have suffered irreparable

18

inj ury.

19

20

21
22
23
24

QUESTION:

You would come out differently, then, on

the appealability of an order disqualifying a lawyer, because
there would be no finality under Cohen?
MR. GROSSMAN:

It is correct that I believe a

stronger case can be made for appealability of orders denying
disqualification than of orders granting,, but I think I'would
frankly acknowledge that even as to orders granting

25

14

1

disqualification, the general view that their appealability is

2

not one that I would be prone to take issue with, although I

3

think we have a stronger case under Cohen in the case of

4

orders denying disqualification.
QUESTION:

5

6

But you lack the finality element in

Cohen, in an order granting disqualification, don't you?
MR. GROSSMAN:

7

Well, I believe that would be a valid

8

concern.

I believe that would be a valid concern which isn't pre­

9

sent here and as a matter of fact I believe that concern points

10

up the fact that in our view the courts which have held that

11

appeal is to be permitted where disqualification is granted,

12

not where it is denied, really are proceeding

13

topsy-turvy, because the stronger case can be made when the

14

denial occurs, rather than where the grant occurs.

15
16

17

18

19

in

a

sense

Now, again addressing the urgency factor, the reason
we believe this injury occurs is essentially this, and why we
believe appealability should be permitted.

If we wait until

the final judgment on the merits, there is the danger — and
obviously no one can say; it is a matter of prediction, because
no one can say with certainty just what's going to happen in

20

any case--but there is a real danger that the case will become
21

indelibly stamped or shaped by the fruits of a breach of confi­
22

dence or by acts or omissions prompted by divided loyalty,
23

as in the present case.

And there's no way that an appeal for

24

the final judgment on the merits could really remedy that.
25

15

1

And in terms of the public interest -- and we think

2

that it is appropriate to address that question, irrespective

3

of Firestone's personal concerns here -- the very fact that a

4

case proceeds in the face, with the taint of a conflict, in our

5

view would tend to undermine the public policy which proscribes

6

conflicts of interest and would adversely color the public's

7

perception of the administration of justice.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, do you think someone who might be

sitting in a courtroom at this hearing, in the spectator's

10

part, could get up and move for disqualification of one of the

1 1

attorneys on the grounds that it was contrary to the public

12

interest ?
MR. GROSSMAN:

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

cases suggesting that any attorney, at least -- leaving aside
the question of a lay person -- any attorney who in a case, whc
was aware of a conflict of interest, because of the public
policy considerations involved, does have a duty to call that
to the court's attention.

22
23
24

I believe that view is sound if that

is the question.
QUESTION:

20

21

While there is authority and there are

No, that wasn't the question.

The ques­

tion was whether a lay person who■presumably has as much
interest in the public interest being enforced as attorneys do
could get up and move for disqualification of one of the
attorneys to the case being heard on the grounds of conflict of
interest ?

25

16

1

MR. GROSSMAN:

I would submit, Mr. Justice, that if

2

in fact that did occur it would be appropriate.

3

would state that in this instance, fortunately, we needn't

4

address that situation because we feel that Firestone does have

5

a very strong personal interest which entitles it to raise it,

6

the question, for the reasons I have indicated.

7

words, we feel there is a degree of private prejudice, so the

8

Court in this case doesn't have to address the question whether

9

a public interest concern alone would be sufficient.

However, I

In other

I believe

10

it ought to be; I don't believe it's necessary to rest the de­

11

cision here .or. that ground.

12

Now, the suggestion has been made that we don't have

13

to allow appeal under the Cohen Doctrine here because the par­

14

ties can secure relief under alternative means.

15

is writ proceedings; another, permissive appeals under

16

1292(b) of the Judicial Code.

One suggested

We submit, however, that if writs are kept within

17

18

the limits that this Court has prescribed,

19

limits, they don't afford a proper means of redress in this

20

21
22
23
24

instance.

and they're very narrow

And on the other hand, we believe it would be un­

wise for the

Court to disregard the limits on writs and allow

them to be used in effect as substitute appeals because that
would set the lower courts adrift

without the benefit of the

Cohen guidelines.
And as for permissive appeals, the very criteria the

25

17

1

statute lays down for such appeals would tend to preclude their

2

use in many instances involving orders denying disqualifica­

3

tion.

4

eral might be viewed as an indication that the disposition of

5

the order -- or appeal from the order, I should say, would not

6

necessarily further the ultimate disposition of litigation, as

7

required under 1292(b).

8
9

For example, the very fact that those orders are collat­

And finally, on this question of appealability, I
would submit that this isn’t a situation where deferring appeal

10

until final judgment is really helpful because, no matter what

11

stage of the proceedings we look at the matter, there's just

12

no way to tell what the impact of the conflict would have been.

13

So we don't gain any benefit by waiting.

14

Now, if this is the case, the question is, why, if it

15

would seem appropriate to nip a proceeding in the bud where

16

it's tainted, have some of the courts failed to allow appeals?

17

I think the answer rests on two misconceptions.

18
19

20

The first,

that this sort of appeal would deluge the appellate courts.
The experience of the 2nd Circuit, which we cited, supposedly
the worst case, does not bear out -- 11 published opinions in
six years certainly doesn't account .for the deluge.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. GIBSON, ESQ.,

12

15

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
In this case Firestone, that has never been a client
of Risjord's, seeks his disqualification..

This case involves

no question of breach of confidential information.

That admis­

sion is made abundantly clear in the reply brief filed by
Firestone in this case.

The only question relating to conflict

is that -- and again, it is speculating what might be -- that
Risjord in representing these plaintiffs could guide or
fashion the case in such a way that would be harmful to Fire­

23
24

stone and helpful to Home.
Now, this assumption is based on this factual

25

22

1

situation, and it is one in which the complete story has not

2

yet come out.

3

based on what he continuously refers to in his brief as a

4

highly unusual intentional tort theory, and that Home has

5

denied coverage for this theory.

6

that Risjord has also pleaded counts in negligence and counts

7

in defective products under Restatement 402(a), alternative

8

counts.

9

these same theories against other defendants, Goodyear, Budd,

Firestone is saying that the Risjord theory is

Now, what is not said is

He has also pleaded, as was brought out a minute ago,

10

Kelsey-Hayes, and we simply don't know who has their coverage.

11

There has certainly been no record made in this case that

12

Home has anything to do with those parties.

13

Now, the fallacy j

‘not only has there been this,

14

lack of disclosure of this: information, but the fallacy that

15

Mr. Grossman, that Firestone must face, is this -- and I

16

think the district judge knew when he heard the motion for

17

disqualification, the common practice in products cases, in

18

most litigation, is that the plaintiff's attorney is going to

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

submit all of the evidence he has, he's going to submit his
cases in the alternative, and the jury then or the judge will
determine what the basis of liability is going to be.
So it is an alternative submission which is undoubt­
edly what we're going to have in this case, not simply a
guiding and fashioning and a pursuing of one theory and an
abandoning of the other theories.
23

That simply isn't the

1

practicality of what is going to happen.

2

Now, the real conflict, as has been observed, is

3

between Firestone and its insuror, Home.

4

suit that has been filed that raises that particular question.

QUESTION:

We never get to this conflict situation

11

12

Risjord was not appealable?

13

MR. GIBSON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

If this

14

Court decides this case is not appealable, in the recent case

15

of Coopers £ Lybrand,

16

found that the Death Knell Doctrine didn't apply, the Cohen

17

Doctrine didn't apply, there was no appeal, and you don't get

step and decided that question.

Some of them haven't.

certainly there is no need to do this.

But

But all of these facts

were before the district judge, when he made his order in this
case, and following that he fashioned the remedy of either
24

1

withdrawal from representation of one or the other of the

2

clients, or obtaining consents.

3

Risjord first obtained those consents from the

4

plaintiffs and from Home and then, following that, Risjord was

5

asked to withdraw by Home, and he did withdraw, and following

6

that, that case, that one case was the one case that Risjord

7

had represented Home in for about a 10-year period.

the deeply rooted argument, we have the Martindale-Hubbell

the 12 9 2 certification.

19

Firestone elected not to do so.

But here it was given by the court anc.

But the real underlying question on the issue of

20
21

appealability in this case, I would suggest to the Court, is

22

simply this, the Cohen Doctrine applies to a small class of

23
24

25

cases.

It is an exception to the rules of final decision and

appealability, and the question before this Court, I suggest,
is should this limitation, this exception, this small class of
26

1

cases be expanded to include a type of case that the courts of

2

appeals have found is disguised harassment5 an abused proce­

3

dure, that which is used as a tactical and a strategic weapon.

4

Now, when we filed our brief in this case, I think

5

on page 21 we cataloged some five circuits that had so charac­

6

terized appeals in disqualification cases.

7

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, don't all lawyers use tactical and

strategic weapons in trying to beat their opponents?
MR. GIBSON:

They certainly do, but the courts have

10

particularly pointed out that this is a particular subject of

11

abuse, and the five circuits have -- in the last month two

12

more circuits have joined the procession.

13

the P. Stone case which we have in our supplemental brief

14

joined in this observation.

And if I may,

But the 1st Circuit on the 31st of

October of this year, In re: Continental Investment Corpora­
tion, Case No. 80-1362, also made a similar observation,
and also determined that cases of this nature, where there was
a denial of a motion to disqualify, were not appealable.
There has been a consistent movement since about
1976 away from the rule of appealability.

When this case came

to this Court on petition for certiorari, Firestone referred
to the Silver Chrysler case from the 2nd Circuit as the leading

25

27

1

case for the rule that disqualification denials were appeal-

2

able.

3

the Armstrong case in the 2nd Circuit, and that joined the

4

procession of Community Broadcasting from the District of

5

Columbia, Melamed from the 6th Circuit, this case below, and

Who is their insurance carrier?
The record is silent on that subject.

I would certainly think, if Home had been their carrier, we
would have known about it, but the record is simply silent as
to who their -- we know that Home is Firestone's carrier, but
the record is silent on the Goodyear carrier, and I simply have
to assume that had Home had some relation to any of the other
defendants, it would have been made part of the record in this
case.

MR. GIBSON:

And you don't know, personally?
I do not know, sir.

And I

in this case, where we are dealing with what

could be and what might be the possibility that the case would
be guided or fashioned in a way favorable to Home and unfavor­

after trial,

because we don't know what's going to happen in

the trial of this case.

And these courts of appeals decisions that have led

QUESTION:

And

Is the trend the same way with respect to

orders granting disqualification?
MR. GIBSON:

Several of the cases, Community Broad­

casting, Melamed, I think the 8th Circuit in this case, and
Armstrong, all held that because the orders granting disquali­
fication parted a client from the lawyer, and because the order
granting really certified that there was merit, that there was
a reason for treating them differently.

Now, Armstrong recog­

nized that maybe this was an inconsistent position, and the -I think Chief Judge Feinberg in his majority opinion simply
accepted the fact that it might be logically inconsistent, but

23

the practicality of it made this a desirable course.
24

I think the 1st Circuit in this recent opinion simply
25

30

1

determined that it would not reach that question.

2

there is, of course --

The trend generally is to treat them both -- is not -- no,

To treat them differently?
MR. GIBSON:

ferently.

Yes.

The trend is to treat them dif­

That's correct, Your Honor; that's correct.
Armstrong, particularly, pointed out that in cases

of this kind the trial court can always reconsider the motion,

10

that protective orders can be issued, and that, of course,

1 1

reversal and a new trial on the appellate level are sufficient

12

remedies to take care of the particular problem involved in

13

this kind of case.

14

Now, the recusal cases that were the subject a minute

15

ago are one specific incident where courts have refused appeal-

16

ability -- and I would say that there is far more problem from

17

the public perception of justice so far as recusal motions of

18

the trial judge

19

Certainly, if they're even, the recusal cases are strong evi­

25

than is involved in the attorney situation.

dence that there should be no appeal in this type of case.
Mr. Justice Stevens in Coopers S Lybrand observed
that rulings on venue, summary judgment, and discovery, really
were not different from determinations of class action issues
that were involved in that case and certainly they are not
different from disqualification motions.
31

1

There are other issues.

Now, the 1st Circuit, the

2

new 1st Circuit decision, Armstrong, both pointed to the im­

3

portant legal issue as an aspect of the Cohen Doctrine.

4

Armstrong recognized that there was a split in this reasoning.

5

Cohen did say that it was the right to security for cost that

6

was the issue in that case that merited appealability, and if

7

it had been a discretionary ruling, this would not have been

8

an appealable order.
Again, Armstrong goes back and forth on whether this

9

10

is an issue.

The 1st Circuit new decision does say that this

11

is an issue.

In the Coopers £ Lybrand decision, Mr. Justice

12

Stevens was particularly writing about the Death Knell Doc­

13

trine.

14

turned on the facts throws the appellate court into the trial

15

business, and obliterates the distinction between the function

16

of the trial court and the function of the appellate court as

17

has been set out in the statutory scheme.

19

20
21

22
23
24

But he said there that to allow appeals from cases that:

One other reason for the importance of the issue
being a factor in this case is that 1292(b), the discretionary
appeal statute, did not exist when Cohen was decided.
does exist.

It now

And in those cases where there is the possibility

of irreparable harm, 1292 is available and 1651 mandamus is
also available.
QUESTION:

As an element necessary for certification,

you would have to say that, it is a probably dispositive issue
25

32

1

in the case,.don't you?

2

MR. GIBSON:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
How could you ever say that the disquali­

4

fication of a lawyer was a probably dispositive issue in the

5

case ?
MR. GIBSON:

6

Well, not -- I think under 1292(b)

7

a legal question has to be shown, but I think all of these

8

circuits have discussed the fact that these discretionary pro­

9

cedures will be available where there is irreparable damage

10

posed.
QUESTION:

1 1

12

that I just put to you?
MR. GIBSON:

13
14

Well, how have they answered the question

I don't think they do.

Your Honor, I don't think they do.
To my knowledge they've not.

Two other issues where Cohen is not met in cases of

15
16

this kind:

17

that's the very wording, that's the very description of it --

simply doesn't apply in this case, and the Solicitor General's
brief that has been filed deals with this question because the
entire theory of Firestone is that the
be fashioned, or could

tridl of the case could

be guided, in a way that is going to

be harmful to Firestone and helpful to Home.

And we're not

going to know, really,

until after the case has been tried.

So their very argument

in this case is tied up with how the

case is going to be tried.

15

Mr. Gibson, do you happen to know, has

the trial been held in abeyance pending the outcome of this

appeal?

MR. GIBSON:

The trial has not been held in abeyance,

and I understand discovery has proceeded on.

In this particu­

lar case it has not resulted in the delay that many of the.courts
of appeals say attend the filing of such a motion.
QUESTION:

But --

Some trial courts view an appeal under

1291 as requiring that the trial proceedings stop, whereas an
appeal under 1292(b) permits the trial proceedings to go on.
But they went on here in either event.
35

1

MR. GIBSON:

In this case discovery activities have

2

proceeded on and I think they are still a ways away from the

3

trial of the first case.

4

But, of course, in this case Risjord has been before

5

the court of appeals, Firestone has been before the court of

6

appeals, and the discretionary finding

7

has been passed upon by the court of appeals, and Firestone

8

has had the very appeal and the very review that it says the

9

appealability question would entitle it to.

of the trial court

And we have cited

10

cases in our brief that this Court frequently has said, where

1 1

two courts, where a trial court and the court of appeals have

12

Dassed on the factual considerations, this Court will not open

13

them up and look into those issues.

14

QUESTION:

Well, this is a troublesome point for me

15

because in both the recent 2nd Circuit case here and the 8th

16

Circuit here they first hold the order as

17

then they go ahead and decide it.

MR. GIBSON:

nonappealable, and

I think as a matter of procedure in

those circuits, these orders had been appealable and they were
ruling that from this point on they would not be appealable,
so that the lawyers would know what the rule is going to be,
and they went ahead to pass on the merits, because the change
was made in these cases.
Now, the 1st Circuit didn't do that.
did, the 6th did, the 8th did.
36

But the 2nd

QUESTION:

Well, Judge Lay certainly spelled it out

specifically, that it was prospective and not applicable to

this case.

That is correct, Your Honor.

court, to go the extra mile, that led the 8th Circuit as well

10

as the 2nd and the 6th to take this procedure, because then

1 1

the new procedure was spelled out.
But the consents were obtained and were filed.

The

withdrawal took place and really, DR-5.105.

today in the highest court of the land that is a court of law,

should be filed with the state court disciplinary mechanism.

And here we are

We have one in Missouri that is appointed by the Missouri
Supreme Court.

And I suggest that's an appropriate place

for advancing the public interest.

In this case I think there

is the aspect to the case of attempting to rid oneself of a
very vigorous advocate, a lawyer that has probed deeply, that
is -- I think publicity in a companion Goodyear case was one of
the

grounds

in this motion that went its way.

They have

probed into the Watergate documents deeply to find a connection
with the slush fund theory, and where they're going with that
37

1

I don't know, but we have a vigorous advocate, and as these

2

courts in the appealability issues rule, the tactical, strate­

3

gic use of this, the disguised harassment, the artifice of

4

what I think Armstrong refers to as "the artful movement"

5

is much with the case.
QUESTION:

7

Of course, Mr. Risjord was a member of

the Missouri Bar.

MR. GIBSON:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.
If he

were not, suppose he were a visit­

10

ing lawyer, what you have just said would be rather inapplica­

11

ble, wouldn't it?
MR, GIBSON:

12

Well, of course, I think, under the

13

new rules, the new Uniform Rules of Attorney Conduct, the

14

district court would have the means at its disposal to take

15

care of the problem.

16

dures they would refer to the State Bar organization where

17

that exists.
QUESTION:

MR. GIBSON:

Judge

Judge Collinson.

In one of the cases, the relief that is requested by

23

Who is the district judge here?

Collinson?

20

22

And of course I think under those proce­

Firestone in this case in the trial court simply was that
Risjord be disqualified in any case in which Home had coverage
or in which confidential information had passed from -- in
any way.

Now, the admission is clear that there was no passage
38

1

of confidential information, because Risjord's only represen­

2

tation of Home was in the totally unrelated fire case. And the

3

other basis for the motion was not satisfied because Home did

4

not provide coverage in the Hale case.

the overbroad reach of the motion that is filed in this case.

6

And this simply shows

But the whole issue on merits, the whole issue on

7

who has the right to consent -- and I might say that this

8

question of consent is discussed in the 4th Circuit opinion in

9

the Aetna Casualty case that's referred to in the Solicitor

10

General's brief.

1 1

it is the client that is required to give the consent.

12

that case, a foreigner to this attorney-client relationship

13

is attempting to assert this theory.

14

held that it is the right of

15

consent, and that's exactly what was done in this case.

16

sents were obtained from Home, they were obtained' from1 the

17

personal injury claimants.

18
19

And they point very clearly to the fact that

Con­

And I might say,1 in discussing the question of the
discretion of the trial court, one other fact that has not come

20

before this Court, there is much assertion in the argument of

21

Firestone that Risjord obtained consents from the unsophisti­

22
23
24

25

cated plaintiffs.

And this Court was not told in the briefs

that three of those unsophisticated plaintiffs had referring
counsel and that those referring counsel had discussed the
consents with their clients, and had obtained the consents from
39

1

the clients and the referring counsel had also given their

2

consent.
But it is omissions of fact of this kind, and of

3
4

course there are assertions that Home and Risjord are acting

5

in tandem.

6

district judge said, there are many speculative matters that

7

he is not going to get to, but here we have the question of

8

purely a factual determination.

There is no evidence of that at all.

And the

10

from the facts, fashioning a remedy of either withdrawal from

1 1

the representation of one or filing the consents.
Risjord did both of those things.

12

There simply is

13

no issue in this case that requires disqualification, and the

14

entire issue really can turn on the fact that this is a case

15

that should not be appealable, and that ends the entire dis­

16

cussion .
I ask this Court to affirm the ruling of the district:
