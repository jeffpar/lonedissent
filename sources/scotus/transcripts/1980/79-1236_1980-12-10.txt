In our brief, petitioners presented two arguments in
support cf the appealability of the district court order.
First, we believe that the order is appealable as an order
denying an injunction under Section 1292(a)(1).

Secondly, we

believe that it is appealable under the collateral order excep­
tion that this Court announced with regard to Section 12 91 in
Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Company.

Before I present my argument on the -- Mr. Justice?

MR. WILLIAMS:

Would you feel that it qualifies under

MR. WILLIAMS:

QUESTION:

3

Yes, I do, Your Ponor.

You don't feel there is any inconsistency

in that position?
MR. WILLIAMS:

4

No, I do not, Your Honor1, for the

5

simple reason that this is a case where the order said so many

6

things that it had the effect of deciding some things on the

7

merits and some things that were collateral to the merits.

In any event, you would be willing to win

at the decision

The matter was presented to the Court
Also, if Your Honor would take a look

by the 4th Circuit belcw,

it's quite clear

that one of the decisions that the 4th Circuit felt wa.s
dispositive of the matter was the 2nd Circuit decision in
Seigal v. Merrick, which was decided entirely under Section
1291.
Your Honor, let me give you some of the background

20

to this case.
21

QUESTION:

Before you do that, counsel, since as I

22

understand the Cohen Doctrine it has to be not related to the
23

merits, if you were successful in appealing this order under
24

the Cohen Doctrine, could you appeal that part that related to
25

the merits, too

5

1

MR. WILLIAMS:

Your Honor, I think it's quite clear

2

from the decisions of this Court that once an appellate court

3

has jurisdiction by virtue of the ancillary jurisdiction that

4

the Court has it can then reach out and decide all other issues

5

in the case that require reversal.

6

Your Honor, this suit concerns

employment discri­

7

mination in the tobacco industry.

This is an industry which

8

has had a long history of official segregation and discrimi­

9

nation with respect to blacks.

The parties have reached a

10

proposed consent order in this case.

1 1

Honor, which was reached after long discussions and after

12

extensive discovery.

13

the parties were quite aware, in part because of the discovery,

14

of the basic strengths and weaknesses of their case.

15
16

17

18
19

20

This is an order. Your

It was a matter that was reached after

The heart of the consent decree was contained in a
series of provisions which enjoin the employer and the unions
from further discriminating against the plaintiffs.

Moreover,

that consent degree had provisions which require the employer
and the unions to take remedial action with respect to changing
the seniority and the transfer rules so that those rules will
not further discriminate against seasonal workers.

21

22

In common with other

consent decrees, Your Honor,

that settlement also had an exculpatory clause whereby the
23

respondents could suffer the injury of a judgment against them
24

without admitting liability.
25

6

1

Because this action was a class action, it was neces­

2

sary to get approval of the district court under Rule 2 3(e)

3

of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

4

tue of this rule went to the district court.

5

point, and for the first time, Your Honor, the parties found

6

themselves at loggerheads with the district court over the que

7

tion'of the legality 1 of 'the proposed settlement.

8

court by virtue of its powers under Rule 23(e) decided that the

9

proposed consent decree with respect to those injunctive pro­

10

visions to which I referred a moment ago was illegal, because

1 1

those provisions, it said, violated Title VII and the enforce­

12

ment of those provisions by a federal court, it said, would be

13

arbitrary and capricious actions which would violate, the; Fifth

14

Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

decree.

7

Now, let me give you some of the reasons for refus­

1

2

ing that decree, which were stated by the district court in

3

the opinion that accompanied this order.
First, the district court said that preferential

4

5

treatment on the basis of race was unlawful except in those

6

cases where the defendants had themselves committed discrimina­

7

tion against those persons who were part of the plaintiffs'

8

class.

10

QUESTION;

Mr. Williams?

MR. WILL],AMS:
QUESTION:

The merits aren't before us, are. they?

MR. WILLIAMS;
QUESTION;

Yes?

That's correct, Your Honor.

Just the appealability, whether the dis­

trict court was right or wrong in what he said about the pro­
priety of the decree,
MR. WILLIAMS:

That's correct, Your1 Honor,

The only

20

reason for going into the merits at all is so that this Court
21

can make a preliminary assessment as to whether or not with
22

respect to the argument under Section 1292(a) the merits were
23

touched upon by the decree, and also to see if the collateral
24

interests which the petitioners claim were adversely affected
25

8

1

were separate and apart from those merits.

2
3

QUESTION:

Had you asked for a preliminary injunc-

t ion?

4

MR. WILLIAMS:

Your Honor, we had not asked for a

5

preliminary injunction and in view of the determination made

6

by the district court, it is quite clear that a preliminary

7

injunction would not and could not have been granted, because

8

that court found that there were no vestiges of discrimination

9

to be corrected or remedied.

And given the fact that it is

10

necessary with respect to a preliminary injunction to estab­

1 1

lish that you have a prima facie case or that you have a. sub­

12

stantial chance of prevailing on the merits, it was clear to

13

the petitioners and I think it would have been clear to the

14

district court as well that that burden could not have been

15

met by petitioners.
QUESTION:

16
17

rary restraining order' was appealable?
MR. WILLIAMS:

18
19

20

21

Would you say that a denial of a tempo­

A denial of a. temporary restraining

order?
QUESTION:

Did you ask for ex parte pending a hear­

ing on a request for a preliminary injunction?
MR. WILLIAMS, No, we did not, Your Honor, but with

22

respect to the denial of the temporary restraining order,
23

I think the law is quite clear that that is not appealable
24

under Section 1292(a)(1), although the denial of a preliminary
25

9

1

injunction is of course', appealable.

2

One further thing which the district court said, and

3

I think I basically mentioned this before, Your Honor, is that

4

despite the long history of segregation and discrimination

5

which had existed in the tobacco industry, that there were no

6

vestiges of discrimination to be: overcome.

7

Now, as I tried to indicate before to Your Honors,

8

petitioners have two arguments which they wish to present to

9

this Court, one based on Section 1292(a)(1) and one based on

10

the collateral order doctrine.

1 1

certain policy considerations which I think must be kept in

12
13

mind as you make a determination as to whether or not this
order was appealable.
The first point which I want to emphasize is that

14

15
16
17

Common to these arguments are

there comes a time in every lawsuit when the parties have to
make a basic decision as to whether or not this is a case which
will be settled or a case which will be litigated.

Petitioners

believe that sound judicial administration requires that
18
19

artificial barriers not be put in the place of parties attempt­
ing to reach settlement in a case.

Whether a settlement can

20

be reached in any case, Your Honor, is

a

function of many

21

factors.
22

One factor that the parties will always consider
23

is the expense of further litigation, especially the expense
24

of further litigation in relationship to the expenses which
25

10

1

have already been incurred.

2

factor, we think, Your Honor, which is quite important in ra­

3

cial discrimination cases and in labor management cases, and

4

that is the desirability which the parties have to keep down

5

forces of civil strife in the workplace.

6

Honor, that this is one of 1he reasons why the Congress of the

7

United States hits endorsed

8

ment and cooperation should be preferred means of resolving

9

racial discrimination cases brought under the Civil Rights

10
1 1

Another factor -- and this is a

the

idea

We think, Your

that voluntary settle­

Act of 1964.
A

third

factor which aiffects settlement possi­

12

bilities would be the parties' assessment of their chances of

13

winning or losing a lawsuit.

14

Honor, which will of course depend upon the time.

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23

Now, this is an assessment, Your
The fur­

ther a lawsuit progresses, the more likely the parties will
tend to reach ai different assessment as to their chances of
prevailing, and therefore the terms of a settlement will vary
with the progress of time.
Therefore, Your Honor, in ax case like this, if the
parties are denied

the settlement that they themselves want

and are forced to litigate further them the parties are being
put irt a position whereby they may never be able to retrieve
the opportunity which they once had.
QUESTION:

Which way, Mr. Williams, do you think the

24

negative aspects of piecemeal appeals cuts in this case?
25

11

1

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, I think, Your Honor, in light

2

of your past decisions, it is quite clear that one of the

3

reasons why this Court has decided that piecemeal adjudication

4

is bad is because of the expense and the time that it consumes,

5

and a] so the cost to the parties and the Court c.nd the public

6

interest as a whole.

7

sidering is the question of cost and the question of time and

8

expense.
So,

9

ii

And here one of the factors we're con­

this particular instance, Your Honor, I think

10

that where you have parties who do not themselves want to

1 1

litigate and who are trying not to litigate, that to give

12

them the opportunity not to litigate is the policy that best

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

furthers the policies behind the avoidance of piecemeal liti­
gation .
If in a case like this, where the district court
erects a legal barrier to the parties'

ability to settle

the

case, that matter should be reviewed, we believe, by an
appellate court so that the parties can determine if they can
or should not go further.
QUESTION:

I suppose part of your argument is that

20

if you allow an appeal you avoid piecemeal litigation, because:
21

if the appeal comes out a certain way the case is over,
22

MR. WILLIAMS:

That's correct, Your Honor, and that

23

is exactly the case here.

If an appeal were allowed and if

24

this case were decided favorably to the petitioner’s, that would
25

12

1

be an end to this litigation.

2

would result in litigation for at least the next two or three

3

years.

4

QUESTION:

Any other course, we think,

Is it not generally true that on the

5

problem of piecemeal appeals that one of the propositions is

6

that if it comes out one way, it wi]1 terminate the litiga­

7

tion, and if it comes out the other way, it does no+ ?

8

that always true?

9

10

1 1

12
13
14

15
16

17

18

MR. WILLIAMS:

Isn't

Well, Your Honor, the only thing

that the parties would have suffered in that particular case
would have been a certain amount of delay if it comes out ad­
versely, in this case, for example, to the petitioners.

Rut

here you have parties who have been willing, certainly up until
now, to settle their claim, so that if it were determined that
the district court was wrong in its ascertainment of the legal
principles that govern decision in this case, then that would
have helped the parties tc. have resolved this matter orior
to the matter coming to this Court.
QUESTION:

But, you're making more of a. Cohen's argu­

19

ment now than anything, I take it, and this kind of an argument
20

would lead you to say that

any denial of a motion for summary

21

judgment would be appealable; because if that denial is re­
22

versed, the case is over.
23

MR. WILLIAMS:

No, we don't think the argument leads

24

to that conclusion. Your Honor.
25

13

We think that it's, for the

1

reason that was indicated in Goldstein v. Cox.

2

points out that your decision in Switzerland Cheese was not an

3

order denying an injunction because the decision in that case

4

turned upon an assessment of the facts, not on a determination

5

of the legal principles.

6

is made and it is denied as a matter of law, then Goldstein v.

7

Cox makes it clear that is for this Court an open question.

Where a motion for summary judgment

But also, Your Honor, in this narticular case it's

8
9

Goldstein

clear that the order of the district court reached the merits.

10

Your Honor, I would like to reserve for further discussion five

1 1

minutes of rebuttal time.

12

concluded.

14

MR. WILLIAMS:
QUESTION:

16

18
19

20
21

22

Could I ask you one question,

Mr. Williams?

15

17

Thanh you.
QUESTION:

13

My white light is on, my time is

Yes, Your Honor.

What if the district court had said

there is now pending in the 4th Circuit a case which will
deci.de the legality of this consent order and I think it will
be decided in about three or four months so I'm going to with­
hold my consent until the 4th Circuit hands down its opinion.
Would you say that that sort of a refusal to enter a consent
decree by the district court may allow you to appeal?
MR. WILLIAMS:

It would not be appealable, Your

23

Honor.

That would simply be a step towards further litigation

24

of the case, and also it would not nass on the merits of the
25

14

1

case.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARLON L. DALTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AND EEOCTAS'AMICT CURIAE
MR.

5

6

Mr.

DALTON:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
More often than not Title VII suits brought by the

7

8

Government end up in consent decrees, thus encouraging volun­

9

tary compliance and maximizing limited federal law enforcement

10

resources.

1 1

Justice Department typically cohta.cts potential defendants and

12

invites them to sit down and discuss settlement, and advises

13

them that should settlement be reached, that agreement must-

14

be memorialized in a consent decree.
Thus to the extent that the Government is forced to

15
16

17

18
19

20

try cases which but for the district court's unreasoned objec­
tion would result in a settlement that's fair to the defen­
dants and that advances the. rights of the p>arties , our ability
to vigorously enforce Title VII and related, statutes is ser­
iously undermined.
Now, we submit that this is appealed from -- is

QUESTION:

Mr. Dalton, you don't suggest that EEOC

QUESTION:

17

23

Well, I can ask Mr. Williams when he

resumes his argument.
MR. DALTON:

19

20

For example, the requirement that super­

me a bit.

I can do it but it's going to stretch

Common tc all appealability theories, in our view,

is the question of whether or not the order at issue is reviewable following final judgment.

As my brother Mr. Williams

indicated, settlements are based upon the parties' assessment
of the strength and weaknesses of their own cases,

their

24

assessment of the facts that the court is likely to find
25

16

1

credible.

2

Indeed, they're replaced by knowledge of the strengths and

3

weaknesses of cases, of the parties’ respective cases, by

4

knowledge of what aspects of your -- what vulnerabilities in

5

your own caise have managed to escape detection.

6

final judgment is in, as a practical matter, the Court of

7

Appeals can never return to the state of facts or perceptions

8

that existed at the time the consent decree was entered into.

9

Because if the litigated judgment is not defective for reasons

After the evidence is in, those perceptions change.

And once the

10

under it, in order to return to the settlement proposal that

1 1

arguably was improperly rejected by the district court, the

12

Court of Appeals would in essence have to base its reversal on

13

facts other than those proved at trial, and on merits other

14

than those, if they appear foliowing a fully litigated case.
Nor can prejudgment review be presumed as the Court

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23

of Appeals did in this case.

There's no parallel in this kind

of situation to Rule 23(c)(1) in the class action context where,
the: rule invites the court to periodically reconsider the
propriety of the: class.
decree is final

Certainly a refusal of a consent

as to the terms in that particular consent

decree.
Moreover, the notion that the Court of Appeals
touched upon of reconsideration of the consent decree, in this
case by the district court, is meaningless in cases such as

24

this one, and such as the City of Alexandria case which we cite
25

17

1

in our brief, in which the district court

itself has unlawful provisions and has no basis in fact,

to enter the decree on more equitable kinds of considerations

8

rather than legal, reconsideration -- the possibili.ty that

9

that order may be

10

reconsidered at some point by the district

court is not an appropriate basis for denying appealability.
For example, the case of Santana v. Collazo, a case

1 1

12

that began in the District Court of Puerto Rico and that ulti­

13

mately wound up in the First Circuit Court of Appeals,

14

Index No. 79-1531, the private plaintiffs and the Justice

15

Department as interver.ors on their side submitted three suc­

16

cessive, entered into three successive consent decrees with,

17

their adversaries, who were the authorities in the Commonwealth

18
19

20
21
22

of Puerto Rico responsible for the juvenile justice system.
On each occasion -- the first "occasion was the district courtasked the parties to make certain modifications in the consent
decree.

The parties returned to the table, made modifica­

tions, and in each instance the Court of Appeals rejected that
consent decree.

So even where the court ostensibly is not

23

basing its rejection on a view of the scope of Title VII,
24

this motion for reconsideration is not the
25

18

boon

that one

1

would guess from the Court of Appeals --

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Dalton.. I take it that under your

3

argument and that of your colleague, that the denial of the

4

consent decree would be appealable by either party?

5

MR. DALTON:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. DALTON:

8

QUESTION:

9

Oh, jf'es , absolutely.
Or both?
Yes.
And does that cause you any kind of

problem?

10

MR. DALTON:

1 1

QUESTION:

12

MR. DALTON:

No.
They'd both’be taking the'same'position?
There may be 'difficulties1, as indeed

13

there were in this case, where no one wants to -- well, in

14

this case what happened was that the plaintiffs sought to

15

appeal the denial of the consent decree and the respondent-

16

defendants wanted to take no position on that in the Court of

17

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

Appeals, because they felt there were not in an adversary
posture.

Courts have tried various means of dealing with that

problem.

Some courts have invited the U.S. Attorney to file

a brief.

Others have appointed counsel for purposes of the

appeal to ta.ke the other side.
QUESTION:

I would suppose that in some cases it

might be the other side that would be most eager to have the
consent decree entered?
MR. DALTON:

Indeed, indeed.

25

19

As this Court said in

1

Weber, there are often business reasons why employers very

2

much want to enter into consent decrees.

3

QUESTION:

Is there any reason why the parties could

4

not abide all the terms of the consent decree, if they were in

5

the posture Mr. Justice White suggested, abide those condi­

6

tions voluntarily even if a district judge would not accept

7

the decree?

8
9

10

MR. DALTON:

Well, it is certain il 's true that par­

ties can enter into private settlements of lawsuits and any
time a party --

1 1

QUESTION:

12

MR. DALTON:

Most times they do, in private litigation.
Indeed.

And it is certainly true that

13

when parties come to the point where they are willing to agree

14

to terms of a settlement, they are much more inclined to abide

15

by them voluntarily than not.

16

routinely enters into consent decrees because they are

17

18

20
21

However,’ the ''Justice Department

enforceable by, among other sanctions, contempt, and because
in the event of changed circumstances it ’s often much more
useful to put the question of whether or not the agreement
should be modified or indeed dissolved to an impartial judicial
tribunal rather than to parties.

So while it is certainly pos­

sible that parties could enter into a private agreement, consent
22
23
24

decree is in the judgment cf the Government a. much more
useful device all around, from the standpoint of all the
parties and'the court.

25

20

1

I'd like to touch upon briefly, Mr. Chief Justice,

2

your question about which way the evils of piecemeal adjudica­

3

tion cut.

4

that interlocutory appeals slow down the trial process is not

5

in this context a terribly useful sense.

6

trying to do in a consent decree is to end the litigation.

7

It's true, as Mr. Justice White points out, that the sane can

8

be said of the summary judgment motion.

9

a summary judgment motion even if a denial is upheld on appeal

10

are only those issues as to which there is legitimate dispute,

1 1

so that even though there may be a trial afterward it's a very

I agree with my brother that the general notion

What the parties are

on the merits.
Moreover, there are other independent reasons why
this Court unanimously concluded, I think correctly, that
a refusal to enter a summary judgment motion is not. appealable, and those factors are not present here,.
Moreover, I don't think that the floodgate of liti­
gation feared by the

Court of Appeals is an appropriate, is

19

on balance a reasonable fear, when we're talking about refusals
20

to enter consent decrees.

To the extent that other reasonable

21

alternative decrees are available, it seems to me i1 's in the
22

parties' perceived interests to search out and reach for
23

those agreements.

The very factors that led the parties to

24

enter a settlement in the first place that Mir. Williams
25

21

1

outlined and the desire to avoid the expense and delay of liti­

2

gation would lead them to reach other reasonable agreements.

3

The kinds of cases that would result in an appeal are precisely

4

like those at bar where the court's refusal to enter the de­

5

cree is based upon a misapprehension of the scope: of the stat­

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

If there are no fur­

Chief Justice Burger and may it please

the: Court:
I'd like to suggest that counsel left out another
very good reason to avoid piecemeal litigation, and I think
that the two opinions filed in the 4th Circuit Lear this out,
and that is they'reinterfering with the orderly processes of the
trial court.

And I think the reading of the two opinions in

the 4th Circuit shows exactly the: type of jungle that we're
getting ourselves into, permitting appeals of the nature that
stands before this Court.

MR. WICKHAM:

QUESTION:

MR. WICKHAM:

Mr. Wickham, I don't understand.

If the

Court of Appeals is correct in holding the order was not

appealable, I don't why a notice of appeal would deprive the

10

district court of jurisdiction, because the notice of appeal

1 1

would be a nullity.

But in the interim, between the time the

MR. WICKHAM:

Well, isn't that the issue we're called

upon tc decide today?
QUESTION:

court would have jurisdiction, but hardly would the district

court assert such jurisdiction pending the decision of the

5

4th Circuit.

6

QUESTION:

I understand that second point.

7

QUESTION:

You won't know that for some little time

8
9

10

yet, will you?
MR. WICKHAM:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

If the district court was deprived of

11

jurisdiction and in fact the order -- then it must be because

12

there was a right to appeal, and if it retained jurisdiction,

13

it must be because the appeal was improper and it just chose

14

to await the outcome of the Court of Appeals decision.

15

MR. WICKHAM:

That's correct.

But we did not make

16

any decision to withdraw our consent until after the Court of

17

Appeals had handed down its mandate, Your Honor.

18
19

20
21
22
23
24

I guess

that's the point I'm trying to make is that -- because I don't
think it's very material to, really, what we've got to get at
here, insofar as to whether or not the 4th Circuit has applied
the proper test laid down by Coopers S Lybrand and by
Gardner, to see whether or not this order was indeed appealable under either Section 1291 or 1292(a)(1).
QUESTION:

If you didn't withdraw your consent,

wouldn't the agreement that you entered into be enforceable
25

27

1

as a Drivate contract?

2

MR. WICKHAM:

Well, we take that position, that that

3

is one aspect of withdrawal of consent is a contractual rela­

4

tionship, rand if we violate it is the remedy a suit for

5

damages or what?

6

as far as we could find out.

7

so-called Weber-tyne rights that the petitioners claim they

8

have lost by this denial of appeal are, after all, private

9

rights.

The law is not clear on that subject at all,
But we contend here that the

It's a voluntary, Weber-type right, which was made

10

between the unions and the Company, and that, same right could

1 1

be agreed upon between the parties, and this case could be.

All T want to know is -We agreed.

Yes, sir.

About the one provision.

Didn't you

agree to the entry of the consent decree?"
MR. WICKHAM:

We indeed agreed to the entry of the

consent decree; that's correct.
QUESTION:

And so that is part of your contractual

obligation ?
MR. WICKHAM:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And yet that part of the obligation,

1 1

because of Rule 23, can be negated by the trial judge if he

12

refuses tc approve it, I suppose.

13

MR. WICKHAM:

Well, the only part that would be ne­

14

gated, it seems to me.-- we ~ coilld' still dntef into a private,

15

agreement-like --

16
17

18

20
21

22

asoneone pointed out a little while ago,

many cases are settled, agreed, and the cases are dismissed.
So the only thing that's really

we're lacking here insofar

as the plaintiffs are concerned would be a contempt proceeding
if the respondents had indeed violated their agreement.
QUESTION:

But if you entered a 25-paragraph settle­

ment agreement and one of the paragraphs says, we will enter
a consent decree, and the district court rejects the consent
decree, that doesn't necessarily void the other 24 paragraphs

23

of the agreement that you’ve entered into voluntarily.
24

MR. WICKHAM:

It doesn't necessarily do so unless one

25

29

1

of the parties would insist upon a consent decree should always

2

be protected by a contempt proceedings for a violation.
QUESTION:

3

Well, I take it the Government suggests

4

that it wouldn't enter into any settlements except in connec­

5

tion with a consent degree.

Is it correct, then, Mr. Wickham to say

that the consent decree contained the settlement agreement of

the parties?

MR. WICKHAM:

That's correct, sir.

And you wished to have the court approve

it.

7

MR. WICKHAM:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WICKHAM:

The district court, yes, sir.

Yes, yes.
Yes, sir.

That's correct.

It seems

10

clear that this is not a final order under 12 91 for’ the --

1 1

the court did make a collateral determination and that ---

12

it's also equally clear that it's not a final order under 1291

13

because the order did not conclusively determine claims for

14

injunctive relief, and also it's clear that it's not final

15

under 1291 because the petitioner can have an effective review

16
17

18
19

20

21
22

of this order prior to and after final

judgment.

Now, the

same test seems to apply as laid down by Gardner fc-r the
refusal of the injunction relief.
QUESTION:

Well, the proposed decree here, the first

paragraph, is that, your client agrees that -- arid a permanent
injunction entered against them enjoining discrimination, and
then, paragraph 3,

it

provides

for

further

injunctive

relief, doesn't it?

MR. WICKHAM:

Well, I think that if you read it --

No question about that, Your Honor.

But it's our position that under Rule 1292(a)(1) the test is

5

whether or not these petitioners were --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. WICKHAM:

Right.
And if not, this type of injunctive

8

relief Is not such that it's covered by the provisions of

9

1292(a)(1), and it's very clear that if it had effective

10

review, number one, as you pointed out, they could ask for a

1 1

preliminary injunction.

12

before or after the refusal of consent decree.

13

certainly be appealable, the refusal of that.

They could have asked for that either
That would

14

QUESTION:

Why would that be?

15

QUESTION:

But normally when three people go into

16

court together to get a consent decree, it's not normal for

17

one side to also ask for preliminary injunction, is it?

18

that the usual procedure?
MR. WICKHAM:

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Is

I don't think it is usual procedure,

but it shows that -- it shows theit if you don't ask for a pre­
liminary injunction you must not feel that you have any

interest

to protect, or to lose, so to speak.

All I'm saying to you, Justice Marsha]1, is that under the
test laid down In Gardner, that is an avenue open to the
petitioners, and then -34

withdraw consent is because the district court judge had re­

QUESTION:
MR. LEVIT:

Yes, down at the bottom.
We did sign it, Your Honor, the unions

25

did sign that.

And we joined in that motion.

But we felt,

2

at least i1 was our position, that no formal withdrawal was

3

necessary for those reasons.

7

MR. LEVIT:

Actually, you filed a motion, or you'd

We made a -- well, at the time that the

8

consent decree was proposed to the district court, there were

9

supporting memoranda filed by the parties in support of the

10

entry of the decree, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

1 1

16

court a letter indicating that a consent decree would be forth

coming to the court, that the parties were proposing to the

18

court.
QUESTION:

19

We stated that we had a

saying, that you withdraw -- you're interested in withdrawing

21

your motion that the consent decree be entered.

22

MR. LEVIT:

QUESTION:
MR. LEVIT:

24

25

Honor.

Well, the two things occurred in such

That's the time that the district -- the consent
39

1

decree was presented and the time that it went -- and the

2

appeal time, and the remand back, was a couple of years, and

3

of course, one of the things I wanted to mention was that the

4

evils of piecemeal litigation certainly involve the appellate

5

court getting involved in the trial process.

6

the petitioners distinguished the Court's decision in Switzer­

7

land Cheese, on the ground that that was just a denial of

8

motion for summary judgment, that there were material issues

9

of fact. But I submit to you that we may have and do have

Now, counsel for

10

basically the same thing here.

11

consent decree, you'll see recitations in there where it's re­

12

cited thatt the district, court judge hais reviewed the extensive

13

discovery, and there was extensive discovery in this case.

14

There were numerous depositions and extensive written inter­

15

rogatories, and production of documents.

16

19

20

So, the district court in denying entry of a consent
decree may very well have done so for principles and on stan­
dards which would be quite similar in denying a motion for
summary judgment.

And it recites that

And in that respect -But Mr.

Levit, didn't he tell us why he

Didn't he give his reasons?

Weren't his reasons

legal reasons rather than the reasons you now describe?
MR.

LEVIT:

I think that the reasons that he gave

would very well encompass precisely what I'm presenting to you
25

40

1

that he felt that it was improper for several reasons that he

2

stated but there's no question that he did review the record,

3

that he did review the extensive discovery involved in the

4

case.

5

away from him when he may feel that there's a material issue

6

of fact -- and I think it's apparent that he did feel that.

7

And for the appellate court to take that prerogative

QUESTION:

Well, but that goes to the merits of

8

whether he acted properly in refusing to enter the decree,

9

it seems to me.

10
1 1

12

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

MR.

LEVIT:

Yes, Your Honor, but the point is that

the appellate court would have to get involved in the trial
process, and the appellate court obviously didn't go through
the discovery.
QUESTION:

Anytime you review a complicated matter

you have to look at the record.
MR.

LEVIT:

Well, I don't think the appellate court

reviewed the discovery in this case.

And that's the point

that we're trying to make, is that the appellate court did not
review the discovery in this case the way the district court judge
did, and that's why the appellate court would not properly

20

get involved in the trial process here.
21

QUESTION:

Let me ask you one other question.about

22

your point that two years went by after you made your motion,
23

and so that you didn't think it was necessary to allege changed
24

circumstances --

if the Court should hold that the order was

25

41

1

appealable and sent' it back to the Court of Appeals, and if

2

the Court of Appeals should hold that the district court com­

LEVIT:

QUESTION:

And therefore', it would have been necessary

Well, Your Honor —
But I suppose the review wi]1 take place

10

as of the date that the district judge acted, arid he either

11

committed error on that date or he acted properly, one of the

12

two.
MR.

13

LEVIT:

I don't think that that's necessarily so.

14

Your Honor, because we can't ignore: the terms of the proposed

15

consent decree.

sent decree the parties state that they want to avoid the time

18
19

20
21

22

And right at the outset of the proposed con­

and expense of litigation.

And perhaps even more than the

expense of litigation in this case is the time.

After all, the

union has a collective bargaining agreement tc administer and
the Company has a business to run, and when these parties
entered into this proposed consent decree it was with the anti­
cipation it would be entered within a reasonable period of
time.

And it may very well, from the union's point of view as

23

a collective bargaining contract administrator result in utter

chaos.

There was no need to discuss it.

Where do you find the agreement that the

MR.

6

WILLIAMS:

Well, Your Honor, we think that's

7

manifested by the conduct of the parties, and. we think that's

8

manifested by their written signatures to the agreement that

9

was being moved for the court tc accept.
But, Your Honor, one of the things that I want to

10

11

point out with respect to allowing a district court to make a

12

legal determination as to what is allowable or not allowable

13

without giving the power of review with respect to that deter­

14

mination, is that in effect it does affect the parties' agree­

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

ment'. to come to terms even out of court.

Were the parties

in this case to. try to enter into an agreement that would
basically achieve the same thing as this proposed consent
decree, then the parties would

find

that with respect to

third parties, there would be: a question as to the legality
of what they were doing because of noncompliance with Rule
23(e).
Two, they would find that the opinion of the district

22

court could be used as a basis to collaterally attack the
23

validity of that out-of-court agreement which they were then
24

trying to voluntarily comply w7ith.
25

47

1

Your Honor, we think that a consent decree is needed

2

in addition to any type of agreement that the Darties might

3

reach voluntarily in a case like this, in part because of the

4

need, as this Court found in United Steelworkers of America

5

v. Weber, tc decide the rights of third parties.

6

Secondly, we think that it is needed because of the

7

need for enforcement with respect to those kinds of mandatory

8

things that the parties are supposed to do or rot to do.
QUESTION:

9

The Weber case didn't involve any consent

10

decree, that was simply an agreement between the employer and

1 1

the labor union.
MR. WILLIAMS:

12

did decide the rights of third parties with respect to the
validity of that agreement.
Thank you very much, Your Honors.

That's correct, Your Honor, but it

Mr. Williams, before you sit down, maybe

it's in the papers, but I did want to clear up one thing about
the procedure.

The nroposed decree purports, as I understand

it, to get rid of all damages -- for all members of the class.
Did the procedure that was contemplated involve notice to the

20

21

class ?
MR. WILLIAMS:

Yes, it did involve some notice, but

22

there's a question as to whether or not those provisions are
23

adequate, Your Honor.

But we don't think that, that would

24

affect the parties' ability to settle the case as such.
