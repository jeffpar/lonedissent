ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. IAN HUNTER, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HUNTER:

7

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue submitted to the Court in this case is

10

limited to a determination whether individual employees who

11

engage in a violation of a collective bargaining agreement

12

and who acted without the authorization of their labor organ­

13

ization are responsible for damages sustained by their em­

14

ployer and liable to it arising out of their individualized

15

breach of that collective bargaining agreement.

16

And I might note that it would appear that is the

17

very issue reserved by this Court in its decision of Atkinson

18

v. Sinclair Refining.

19

20

QUESTION:

I think a -Is this exclusively a question under

Section 301?

21

MR. HUNTER:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. HUNTER:

Yes, Your Honor.
Of the 1947 Act?
Yes, It is, Your Honor.

A brief reci­

24

tation of the facts, I think, are important to a determinatior

25

of this issue.
3

In June of 1967 the respondent employees engaged in

1

2

a work stoppage against the three petitioners for up to and

3

including two weeks in time.

4

respondents admit that at no time did their labor organiza­

5

tion, aid, abet, condone, or authorize this work stoppage,

6

that this was indeed an individual action on their part.
QUESTION:

7

8

MR. HUNTER:

13

I'm equating it to the violation of

the agreement that contained a no-strike clause.
QUESTION:

1 1
12

You're equating that to ordinary breach

of contract between private parties?

9
10

Now, petitioners alleged and

Just as though there was no union entity

involved?
MR. HUNTER:

Well, I can't involve a collective

14

bargaining agreement without acknowledging the role of the

15

union, but I do know that the no-strike clause should be

16

equally enforceable against the employees as well as the union.

17
18

QUESTION:

Just as though 124 Individuals had

signed a contract with the employer without any union?
MR. HUNTER:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. HUNTER:

To the degree that they signed a no­
Yes, Your Honor.
Yes.

That's what I'm driving at.

Petitioner employers now attempt to

23

hold these employees responsible for the damages directly

24

resulting from their individualized breaches of the collec­

25

tive bargaining agreement pursuant to this lawsuit brought in

4

1

accordance with Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations

2

Act.
Now, although 301 on its face contemplates suits

3
4

alleging violation of collective bargaining agreements,

5

petitioner concedes that the language does not expressly

6

address the issue of individual liability arising out of

7

those violations.

8

in the opinion of petitioners, indicates that Congress did

9

not specifically authorize or prohibit such actions against

10

individual employees, when their conduct was not authorized

11

by their local unions.

A review of relevant congressional history,

QUESTION:

12

Well, I gather though the statutes,

13

the genesis, initially, was that there wasn't any way pre­

14

viously of suing unions.
MR. HUNTER:

concerns.
QUESTION:

And 301 was enacted so that unions might

be made subject to suits.
MR. HUNTER:

22

Yes, that was one of the principal

QUESTION:

That's right.

That was one of the

That was one, as I understand, not the

Well, I know, but -- it may not have beer,

23

the only one, but was there one that individual employees

24

should be subject to suits?

25

MR. HUNTER:

Was there -- ?
5

1

QUESTION:

Was one of the reasons to make indi­

2

vidual employees alleged to have violated collective bar­

3

gaining agreements subject to suits?

4

MR. HUNTER:

No, I don't believe that there was any

5

specific discussion covering that subject matter in the Taft-

6

Hartley.

7

The purpose of the Taft-Hartley, as I understand

8

it, and in reading this Court's decisions, not attempting

9

to tell you what you meant, but attempting to read as what I

10

understand it to be, is that Section 301 was intended to per­

1 1

mit the enforcement of labor agreements against labor organi­

12

zations, as pointed out by Justice Brennan; to hold these

13

agreements equally binding upon all parties to that collec­

14

tive bargaining agreement; to foster a collective bargaining

15

process as the desired method of resolving industrial disputes

16

in this country.

17

QUESTION:

Now, as I recall it, there was a lot of

18

discussion in the legislative history of the Danbury Hatters

19

case, wasn't there?

20

MR. HUNTER:

There was, particularly in the Case bill

21

and to some degree as it related to Section 301(b).

22

there was indeed some congressional concern about that, but

23

petitioners respectfully suggest that the facts confronting

24

the Court in this issue are considerably different and not

25

analogous to Danbury Hatters.

Now,

As I understand Danbury Hatters
6

1

it was a decision which arose out of a consumer or secondary

2

boycott by the Hatters' Union against Danbury Hatters.

3

my understanding that the members of the union who were ulti­

4

mately held responsible for damages may or may not have known

5

of the actions of their union.

6

But by their association with the union the court held that

7

they were responsible for the damages Imposed by the union.

8

And this was the spectrum --

9
10
1 1

QUESTION:

It's

It was a consumer boycott.

But that the union.,, as union, could not

be held responsible?
MR. HUNTER:

No, the union could have been held

12

responsible but in that time they couldn't have because it

13

was under court-abridged association; right.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. HUNTER:

That's right.
And therefore they had to go to the

16

employees to seek the assets to fulfill for damage remedies.

17

Congress was concerned about that and sought in 301(b)

18

specific language which said that a damage judgment against

19

unions is not to be held -- the individuals are not to be

20

held responsible.

21

to invade that, or this Court's prior decision in Atkinson

22

v. Sinclair.

23

And we are not attempting by this decision

But we are addressing another issue.

Now, respondent and amicus, we believe, erroneously

24

attempt to convert some legislative history dealing with the

25

Case bill as dispositive of the present issue.
7

And in that

1

sense they attempt to persuade the Court that the Case bill

2

discussions, which did deal with the issue of discipline be­

3

ing the sole remedy available to employers in an unauthorized

4

strike, is applicable to the Taft-Hartley bill.

5

the Congress's discussion as to 10(d) of the Case bill as the

6

points in question that respondent attempts to emphasize.

7

And I direct

They contend that this language and the congres­

8

sional discussion attendant to this language provides a basis

9

for the premise that Congress must have intended that disci­

10

pline should be the sole remedy available to the employer.

11

I believe these arguments avoid two very significant facts.

12

One,the provisions of 10(d) of the Case bill did not survive

13

the Taft-Hartley and, in fact, show up only briefly in the

14

early days of the Taft-Hartley and disappear inexplicably.

15

And we can't find out why, in reading the congressional his­

16

tory, but it disappeared.

17

the respondents as well as the three circuit courts which have;

18

discussed this matter, do not recognize that this discussion

19

was not repeated, it was not an integral part of the congres­

20

sional history of the Taft-Hartley.

21

Effort

And the discussion relied upon by

to impose upon the Taft-Hartley the meaning

22

of a provision not included within it seems to be erroneous

23

in the opinion of petitioners.

24

congressional silence as the adoption of a controlling rule

25

of law is less treacherous, as I reflect the verbiage of

Moreover, the role of

8

1

this Court in Boys Markets.

2

tive of the present issue, is the discussion in the House

3

conference report, in the Taft-Hartley itself, where the

4

House rejected the Senate's proposed unfair labor practice

5

involving breaches of collective bargaining agreements, which

6

ostensibly would have encompassed a violation of a no-strike

7

clause;

8

ment of collective bargaining agreements by the usual pro­

9

cesses of law, a principle noted by this Court in Dowd Box

10

We believe

that

more disposi­

omitted that provision, in deference to the enforce­

and reflected in the House conference report, No. 510, p. 52.
Petitioners respectfully submit that a damage

1 1
12

remedy against the proven violators of a contract certainly

13

is more consistent with the usual processes of law than the

14

total absence of such remedy or the total dependence upon a

15

disciplinary device which is suggested by the courts, the

16

circuit courts and respondents.

MR. HUNTER:

No, I would mean that the facts of

there would be no way that petitioners could seek to hold

My question is, suppose that the union was liable in this

Suppose on the facts of this case the union could be

MR. HUNTER:

QUESTION:

16

Fine.
Could the employer also sue with the

union the employees?
MR. HUNTER:

I would suggest that 301(b) establishef

17

a firmer foundation for precluding that remedy than it does

in this case.

20

The union itself would be held responsible

QUESTION:

But would you just say, would you say

21

that the -- you say that if the union were liable, the em­

22

ployees, the action against the employees should be dismissed

23

for failure to state a cause of action?

24

MR. HUNTER:

Yes.

Yes, I would say that that would

It is the

Why couldn't you sue the employees directly

MR. HUNTER:

Again, I suppose you could and maybe

13

that's the next step in this development of the law, but,

14

seeing as the union's responsible for the fact that it's in­

15

of principle, because the --

MR. HUNTER:

All under the auspices of their local

21

where they avoid that device along with a no-strike clause

22

that I feel that they put themselves in jeopardy and leaving

23

the employer without a remedy.

Well, don't you have a remedy in the

state court?

It's

MR. HUNTER:

QUESTION: Well, if you say it, if the federal law

That's my understanding; we do not.
Why not?
The federal law is exclusive under 301.

5

covers it and there's no cause of action against the employees

6

that’s the answer, and if that's your relief, that would be

7

true whether there was jurisdiction under 301 or not.

8
9

MR. HUNTER:

The state court maybe at that point,

but then, say, in light of a determination that there is no

10

cause of action against employees in the federal law, there­

11

fore we have jurisdiction and we could --

12

QUESTION:

Well, the question would be, whether a

13

federal law affirmatively says there is no cause of action

14

against individual employees --

MR. HUNTER:

QUESTION:

17

MR. HUNTER: Well, could there be a remedy available
In the state court under either of those circumstances?

20

21

QUESTION:

No, and the first one there, it clearly

would not be.

22
23

Or whether the holding is that federal

law just is nonexistent in that area.

18
19

Then I would —

MR. HUNTER:

Not be, and the other one there might

be.

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Well, why wouldn't there be, if federal
12

1

law is simply nonexistent, then there would no barrier to a

2

state law, if you have -- isn't that right?

3

MR. HUNTER:

4

QUESTION:

Exactly.
But if federal law affirmatively says

5

there cannot be a right of action against individual employ­

6

ees, then there can't be in a state court either.

7

MR. HUNTER:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's right.
But in our Boeing decision of some years

ago, didn't we say that it wasn't up to the NLRB to decide

10

whether the fines levied by a union on members who crossed a

11

picket line were unreasonable or not, that that was an action

12

that would have to be brought in a state court?

MR. HUNTER:

It did, but I don't know how that

points on to the issue.

And you wouldn't suggest then that you

could turn around and sue them in state court?
MR. HUNTER:

No, I certainly would not at this point.

I feel I am limited to whatever remedy is available under

14

the federal law at this point in the development of the

federal labor laws.

current state of the law.

And the problem that we have as peti­

In the context of the absence of any explicit con­

history, we look as petitioners to the language of this Court

to determine the logic of our suggested remedy.

22

QUESTION:

Well, could I ask you, is it clear under

23

the lower court cases -- I'm not sure that we have a case --

the employer.

MR. HUNTER:

18

I believe it was Senator Taft that

19

even suggested that in some of his dialogue that after all,

20

if an employee quits, he's quitting when he violates the no­

21

strike clause and he ought to assuming that's what he wanted.

22

And he concurred with that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HIRAM S. GROSSMAN, ESQ.,

17

Mr. Grossman.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

18

QUESTION:

You might at some point, if you would,

19

touch on that legislative history, but at your own time and

20

convenience.

21

22
23

MR. GROSSMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Respondents respectfully urge this honorable Court

24

to affirm the decision of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals

25

and conclude that petitioner is not entitled to a damage
24

1

remedy under Section 301 against its employees who breached

2

a collective bargaining agreement by participating in an

3

unauthorized work stoppage; and that the petitioners' remedies

4

and relief under Section 301 are discipline and discharge of

5

employees, which I may add, it has already done; it obtained

6

a Boys Market injunction; and it quickly did end the unauthor­

7

ized work stoppage which it has already obtained; and they

8

had the cooperation and the assistance of the union in not

9

authorizing or sanctioning the work stoppage, and also urging

10

the employees to return to work.
QUESTION:

1 1

Well, Mr. Grossman, what if a producer

12

had a contract with Ingrid Bergman and she walked off the

13

lot honoring a no-strike clause, or a sympathy strike, or

14

something like that, and do you say that there would be no

15

action even in diversity in a federal court against her

16

for damages?
MR. GROSSMAN:

17

Are we somehow saying that Ingrid

18

Bergman is also covered under this collective bargaining

19

agreement?
QUESTION:

20
21

Yes, that she's a member of the Screen

Actors' Guild.
MR. GROSSMAN:

22

She's a member of the Screen Actors'

23

Guild.

I would say then, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

24

that the provisions of the Act, although not expressing it,

25

the legislative history, and the policy behind the Act
25

1

would not allow a damage remedy.

2

QUESTION:

In other words, the Congress affirma­

3

tively prohibited damages by simply conferring jurisdiction

4

on federal courts under 301?

5

MR. GROSSMAN:

Well, I think the purposes of the

6

enactment of Section 301 are -- when I say limited, are —

7

It was to

9

ments, it was to also assure the union -- let me back up.

10

It was also to assure employees that even if they did violate

11

terms of the collective bargaining agreement, they would not

12

be subject to a damage action but --

13
14

QUESTION:

Where do you find that in the language

of 301?

15

MR. GROSSMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

Okay.

Well --

That a party whose agent negotiates an

agreement for them is not subject to damages -- ?

18

MR. GROSSMAN:

The language does not expressly

19

state that, Your Honor, but what I am saying the purpose of

20

the statute, the enactment of the statute, it was to accom­

21

plish certain limited ends.

22

make unions responsible under the terms of the collective

23

bargaining agreement.

But why aren't they subject to damages

the way any other person signing an employment contract is?
MR. GROSSMAN:

Under Section 301, I am maintaining,

they would not be, because Congress in enacting the legisla­

9

tion created these rights that can be used to enforce the

10

terms of the contract to a specific group.

11

bound the union, it made the union responsible for its actions

12

It makes -- when I say it makes the employees responsible,

13

it makes it that if the employee breaches the terms of a

14

contract and the employer acts by disciplining or discharging

15

the employee, the employee has, what I say, no recourse.

16

The enactment, at the time Section 301 was enacted, the

17

Taft-Hartley Act added union unfair labor practices, it also

18

stated that if an employer discharges an employee and the

19

employer has cause, the employee does not have a right of

20

action under the National Labor Relations Act to allege that

21

his discharge was violative of that.

22

QUESTION:

And I say, it

Does an employee have a right to sue

23

in a federal district court, not under 301, but under diver­

24

Now, to take

example, made a private contract, is not a member of any

11

union, then walked off the scene when they'd done half of the

12

film and spent millions of dollars, would there not be a

13

suit for breach of contract for damages against her?
MR. GROSSMAN:

14
15
16
17
18

Well, if there would, it wouldn't be

under 301.
QUESTION:

No, no, but, there's no question about

if there would be, would there not? A breach of contract?
MR. GROSSMAN:

There conceivably could be, if their

19

rights were violated.

20

front of us now is that this action was brought under Section

21

301, it wasn't brought under diversity, it wasn't brought

22

under any --

23

QUESTION:

But the focus that we have to put in

Then the question arises, whether 301

24

precludes -- now, you, you, I take it, concede that there

25

being no union contract, there being no 301 problem, the
28

1

producer could have an action for breach of contract against

2

the actor or actress.
MR. GROSSMAN:

3
4

Okay, I can't see any reason why

they could not.

5

QUESTION:

There's no equitable remedy available

6

because they can't compel the painting of a picture or the

7

performance of a work of art.

8

then, because there happens to be a collective bargaining

9

contract?

10

Unless you can point to something that Congress

intended to wipe out that private action.

11
12

So, what is the difference,

MR. GROSSMAN:

Okay.

I'm not going to contend --

that I'm unaware whether Congress Intended to wipe out --

13

QUESTION:

Well, the question here is, isn't it --

14

or am I mistaken? -- whether or not Section 301 confers

15

federal jurisdiction over a case such as this?

16

MR. GROSSMAN:

But that is -- okay, that is a

17

matter that, how this matter originally arose, and it arose

18

in 1976.

Yes, it was --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GROSSMAN:

21

Well, is that the question or not?
It is that whether it's under

Section 301 --

22

QUESTION:

Whether or not Section 301 confers the

23

jurisdiction of a federal district court over an action such

24

as this?

25

MR. GROSSMAN:

Over a damage action against
29

1

2

individual employees.
QUESTION:

Mr. Grossman, if you look at the statute,

3

what the statute says is, jurisdiction is conferred on dis­

4

trict courts of suits for violation of contracts concluded

5

as the result of collective bargaining between an employer

6

and a labor organization representing employees in an indus­

7

try affecting commerce. And the question is whether this is

8

a suit which is maintainable under that language, isn't it?

9
10
11

12
13

MR. GROSSMAN:

It's a suit that is maintainable

under 301 -QUESTION:

That's what I say, is it -- it's a

question of construction of that language, isn't it?
MR.

GROSSMAN:

In construing Section 301(a), the

14

type of suit, to seek the remedy of damage, I would say that

15

Secton 301(a) does not intend that type of --

16
17
18
19

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Cannot be construed to authorize a

suit of this kind or confer jurisdiction over -MR. GROSSMAN:

No, it would not confer jurisdiction

on a federal district court to entertain a suit of this type.
QUESTION:

Now, that's what you have to persuade

us, isn't it?
QUESTION:

May I just add one question?

Is it not

23

also true that if 301 does not authorize this suit, then the

24

suit may not go forward, because there's no other basis for

25

federal jurisdiction here?
30

1

MR. GROSSMAN:

2

QUESTION:

True.

So we don't have to reach the question

3

whether it's 301 prohibits the suit.

4

decide whether it authorizes a suit.
MR. GROSSMAN:

5

6

That's right.

We just have to first

If Section 301 does

hot authorize the suit, then --

7

QUESTION:

That's the end of this case.

8

MR. GROSSMAN:

9

QUESTION:

That's the end —

And whether they could sue in a state

10

court or sue Ingrid Bergman would be in another lawsuit, not

11

this one.

12

13
14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Grossman, on that other thing

you're saying that the remedy is to discharge?
MR. GROSSMAN:

Well, the employer has the option

of disciplining or discharging the employees.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you, if 90 percent of the

17

employees go out on an illegal strike, is firing them an

18

adequate remedy?

19

MR. GROSSMAN:

20

QUESTION:

21

Because he couldn't run on ten, with

that, can he?

22

MR. GROSSMAN:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

If the employer so --

I'm sorry.

I said, if 90 percent are out, is his

only remedy to fire 90 percent of his labor force?
MR. GROSSMAN:

No, he can do what this employer did
31

1

is go into federal district court and seek an injunction whicl

2

it obtained.
QUESTION:

3
4

Why do you

How -- why can he do that under 301?

concede that?
MR. GROSSMAN:

5

Because in this particular action

6

the employer in his filing of the lawsuit filed it against

7

both the union and the employees and we did not raise the

8

particular question at the time.
QUESTION:

9

It would seem to me if he can, and if

10

you concede that he can, then you're conceding away your law­

11

suit .

12

MR. GROSSMAN?

13

QUESTION:

14

Okay, I --

Well, you're conceding away the juris­

dictional point that the federal courts set --

15

QUESTION:

Which is the only point here, isn't it?

16

QUESTION:

Well, you're not conceding the cause of

17
18

action?
MR. GROSSMAN:

No, I'm not conceding the cause of

19

action, Your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

Otherwise you would be out of our --

21

QUESTION:

Well, the reason he could go into

22

federal court and get an injunction is that Boys Market held

23

that he could, if what he had was an arbitration clause in

24

the agreement.

25

MR. GROSSMAN:

With Boys Market this Court concluded
32

1

that if the matter is subject to the parties' collective bar­

2

gaining agreement, and the walkout involves a dispute that is

3

covered by the collective bargaining agreement, then an in­

4

junction can be obtained.

5

on the second hearing concluded, that the employer was en­

6

titled to a Boys Market injunction.

7

8
9

QUESTION:

And that's what the district court

Now --

Did the injunction in Boys Market run

against the employees as well as the union?

Do you remember?

MR. GROSSMAN: Yes.

10

QUESTION:

Against both?

1 1

MR. GROSSMAN: It ran against the employees, it ran

12

against the local, it ran against the international.

13

as soon as the injunction was issued they went back to work.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

And

So to that extent we have recognized

that there is a 301 action against the employees.
MR. GROSSMAN:

See, the 301 action would refer to

17

the ability under 301 to obtain a damage -- the remedy of

18

damages against employees participating in an unauthorized work

19

stoppage, it seems to me.

20

which created

21

tain types of actions against a union, that to presume because

22

the language does not specifically say that the employer,

23

you cannot sue individual employees individually for their

24

participation in an unauthorized work stoppage, thereby you

25

can read that into it because it doesn't explicitly say

And I say that under Section 301,

certain type of rights which permitted cer­

33

1

you can't.

2

are rights that are created, you should -- if it was Congress'

3

intent to have a remedy such as a damage remedy against indi­

4

vidual employees who participate in unauthorized work stop­

5

pages, it should have been explicitly stated and expressly

6

stated.

7

I'm saying, in a statute of this tyre where there

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Grossman, is your basic argu­

8

ment that there is no 301 jurisdiction in federal courts for

9

this kind of an action, or that this kind of an action simply

10

cannot be brought because Congress has prohibited imposing

1 1

liability on individual members ?

12

MR. GROSSMAN:

Okay, I would say that the language

13

of the statute doesn't permit it, the legislative history

14

doesn't say that Congress intended to allow it, and what

15

petitioners are attempting to have this Court do is by the

16

inventive -- because this is an area that's in the penumbra,

17

is to use the

18

sue and obtain a money damage action, remedy, against employ­

19

ees where the language doesn't say they can.

20

judicial

QUESTION:

inventiveness to allow them to

Well, but -- so your argument is basic­

21

ally, no 301 jurisdiction, not that if there were diversity

22

jurisdiction in a federal court?

23

but might be in some other cases, that federal substantive

24

law prohibits the maintenance of this sort of thing?

25

MR. GROSSMAN:

Which there wasn't here,

Yes, I would say, even if there were
34

1

diversity, if it was under a collective bargaining contract,

2

that there would be a prohibition.

3
4

5

QUESTION:

How do you explain Smith v. Evening

News, then?
MR. GROSSMAN:

Smith v. Evening News?

Okay, it

6

was basically a question of double jurisdiction.

And you

7

can -- this Court could have arrived at the decision at Smith

8

v. Evening News without determining, for example, whether the

9

employees, the employee who was suing for a wage claim,

10

basically, was "a party" to the contract, I said, a party to

1 1

the contract.

12

301(a), we talk in terms of jurisdiction of the parties.

13

Is it one of the -- when you talk in terms of

Now, does that just mean the employer and the

14

labor organization who are "the parties" who, to the contract';

15

Would It permit in an individual who is a beneficiary of that

16

contract to sue for rights under the contract?

17

rights under the contract, this Court, I would say, allowed

18

in suits such as Smith, allowed in suits such as --

19

QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't you. --

Suing for

in the Smith

20

and Lucas, those kinds of suits in a state court, under 301,

21

they are governed by federal law.

22

MR. GROSSMAN:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, they are, Your Honor.

And I don't suppose you could get a

24

remedy in a state court that, for example, against a union

25

that Carbon Fuel said you couldn't get?
35

MR. GROSSMAN:

1

No, it would be inconsistent, it

2

would not -- it would be inconsistent with the federal deci­

3

sions that -QUESTION:

4

Yes.

So, your real submission, it seems

5

to me, is that under the federal law damage recoveries from

6

individual employees are simply forbidden.

7

cause of action against them for that.

8

MR. GROSSMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

There's just no

Yes, sir, that is true.

Whether under 301, or whether in state

court, or whether in federal court, or -- ?
MR. GROSSMAN:

11

Yes, I would say if you're going to be

12

going under, if the theory of the lawsuit involves collective

13

bargaining and a breach of the collective bargaining agreement.
QUESTION:

14

Then that's as true of Ingrid Bergman who

15

may have damaged the employer by $2 or $3 million, as by

16

someone who quits voluntarily and can easily be replaced?
MR. GROSSMAN:

17
18

Well, I don't know -- okay, If she's

covered under this contract.

19

QUESTION:

Well, this is a hypothetical.

20

QUESTION:

The assumption is that she is, and then

21

your answer's the same.

22

MR. GROSSMAN:

Right, my answer would be the same

23

again.

Now -- and, what I see, employer-petitioner really

24

has obtained all the relief that it can under the statute.

25

As I mentioned, they did obtain a Boys Market injunction,
36

1

they did discipline and discharge employees, and they ob­

stoppage.

Congress indicated what it wanted to do is, it tended to

make unions accountable.

of the contracts; I think did not want to impose a damage

7

action remedy against individual employees who participated

8

in unauthorized work stoppages; and again, it allows the

9

employer the ability to discharge employees who were involved

The -- okay, in enacting the Section 301, the

They wanted to insure enforcement

10

in an unauthorized work stoppage by disciplining them and/or

11

discharging them.
QUESTION:

12

As I recall the Taft-Hartley provision,

13

one of them was to say that no worker should be penalized for

14

engaging or for not engaging in collective activity.

15

your construction of 301 would immunize workers who

16

worked under a collective bargaining agreement that was ob­

17

tained by collective activity from any damage remedy.

18

as a single worker who signed an agreement to work would be

19

liable.

20

MR. GROSSMAN:

And yet

Where­

If the single worker was covered

21

under the collective bargaining agreement, I don't -- okay,

22

what I'm -- I guess, if you could imagine a situation where

23

there were 100 employees and only one walked out, yet caused

24

the employer damages, and what I would maintain is, that

25

employee could only be discharged.
37

The fact that he caused

1

his employer monetary damages, the employer could not bring a

2

301 action against the employee for the damages imposed.
QUESTION:

3
4

Do you concede or do you not that this

lawsuit comes within the literal language of 301(a)?

5

MR. GROSSMAN:

6

QUESTION: Well, do you -- perhaps you didn't under­

7

stand my question.

8

language of 301(a)?

Does the lawsuit come within the literal

MR. GROSSMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

It was brought under 301(a), yes.

Okay, it involves --

This was a contract between an employer

11

and the laborers' organization --

12

MR. GROSSMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

Representing employees in an industry

affecting commerce, wasn't it?

15

MR. GROSSMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

Right.

That's correct, Your Honor.

And this is a suit for violation of that

contract.

18

MR. GROSSMAN:

19

QUESTION:

That is true.

And therefore, do you concede that it

20

comes within the literal language of 301(a)?

21

that a suit for violation of that contract can as a matter of

22

law be brought only against the labor organizations?

23

MR. GROSSMAN:

Or do you think

Well, I think that it can be brought

24

against -- okay, it has been brought against both.

25

looked -- looking backward, I may have in 1976 raised certain

questions at the point of time that initially the employer

decided it wasn't going to pursue it any further against the

sation and the court enjoined it and enjoined everybody at

the time, including the employees.

But both parties were initially brought under the law­
The lawsuit was filed against individuals as well as

QUESTION:

How did the international and the local

drop out of the case?
MR. GROSSMAN:

The petitioners elected not to pur­

sue the cause of action against them.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GROSSMAN:

Once the --

Proceed only against the employees?
Once the work stoppage ended, every­

14

body went back to work and the petitioners pursued the damage

15

remedy against the employees.

16

that the petitioners made was much, in point of time, earlier

17

than this Court's decision in Carbon Fuel.

18

QUESTION:

And may I add, the decision

Well, was there ever any decision or

19

any claim that the union couldn't have been liable even if the:

20

employees were?

21

MR. GROSSMAN:

22

QUESTION:

23
24

25

I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

Was there ever a decision by a court

that the union couldn't have been liable in all cases?
MR. GROSSMAN:

No, it was, the only decision that

the court made was to order everybody back to work.
39

QUESTION:

1

Because certainly Atkinson v. Sinclair

2

said you can't avoid 301(b) by just suing the employees, if

3

the union is liable.
MR. GROSSMAN:

4

No, that's correct.

And this law­

5

suit, I guess, could have continued with the petitioner suing

6

both the local and international -QUESTION:

7

Well, why don't you -- why isn't,

8

why aren't you arguing -- maybe you are -- that you really

9

can't tell, at least you can't hold the employees liable,

10

until it's been legally determined that the union is not

11

liable?

12

MR. GROSSMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GROSSMAN:

Okay.

Had they elected to continue

with the lawsuit, I would have -- no, it would have had -QUESTION:

17
18

Because if it is, Atkinson v. Sinclair

says 301(b) bars it.

15
16

Well --

Well, they can't elect -- Atkinson says

you just can't elect to sue employees.
MR. GROSSMAN:

19

No, what I'm saying to you is that

20

had petitioner elected to continue keeping all the parties

21

in the lawsuit --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. GROSSMAN:

Yes?
-- what would have happened is, I

24

guess

25

saying that you could not, by respondents, that you could not

the same type of motions could have been brought,

have, permit a damage action against individual employees.
QUESTION:

You couldn't have had judgment against

both of them?

4

MR. GROSSMAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. GROSSMAN:

Well, yes, under --

Under 301(b)?
Well, you could have precipitated

7

the matter by saying that 301 would not permit a damage remedy

8

against individual employees; as I did.

9

QUESTION:

And, or, and the employer could have

10

said, could have said, well, we think they're both liable,

1 1

but if the union isn't, certainly the employees are.

12

MR. GROSSMAN:

Right.

13

faced with the same matter --

14

QUESTION:

15
16

the union would

Exactly.

Then you would have been

Well, how do we know whether

ever have been liable or not?

MR. GROSSMAN:

We don't know.

Your Honor, in look­

17

ing at the legislative history, there was a congressional

18

concern to avoid the repetition of Danbury Hatters, and as

19

this Court recognized in the Atkinson case, that what the

20

way the lawsuit developed was that it was only the individual

21

employees who were sued, and it was only the individual em­

22

ployees who had a judgment against them.

23

that the Danbury Hatters employees were sued pales in signif­

24

icance to the amount of dollars that are being sought in this

25

particular case.

And the $250,000

Now, that really has no bearing, but, see,
41

1

Congress was concerned that under Danbury that they didn't

2

want to have a repetition of Danbury Hatters, and my conten­

3

tion is, with respect to that, is that not only in the situa­

4

tion where you could say conceivably it was the union that

5

was at fault.

6

want to have a situation where individual employees would be

7

responsible in damages for even unauthorized work stoppages,

8

their breaches of the collective bargaining agreement.

9
10
1 1

I think Congress spoke and said, we do not

QUESTION:

What section do you rely on for that?

What language?
MR. GROSSMAN:

Okay.

I relied on the fact that

12

had Congress intended to include and allow damage actions

13

such as petitioner is seeking, it would have said so.

14

Now, the reason that I say that is that it was, what I say,

15

creating these rights in this legislation.

16

to do it, it would have said it.

17

plication say it is there because there's nothing in the lan­

18

guage of the statute one way or the other.

19

I feel that in 301(b) there's the language that says that if

20

a union is responsible for a breach you should not look to the

21

employees, is that that was the only type of remedy, monetary

22

remedy that Congress was willing to allow.

23

to allow a damage action against unions if they had breached

24

the terms of the contract.

25

breached the terms of the contract, you can get a money damage

Okay?

42

Okay?

So if it intended

that is the only type of money damage remedy that in effect

But the individual members are immune

From financial liability.

They are

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GROSSMAN:

From financial -Right; financial liability, and

17

as I said, the reason that that was the case is that Congress

18

recognized, and acknowledged, that employees who do partici­

19

pate in unauthorized activity, who breach the contract, are

20

subject to discharge and discipline, and they have no protec­

21

tion under the Act.

damages thereby entitles the employer to sue the employee

for money damages.

No, but we have an overwhelming --

We have an overwhelming policy to

promote, to promote the adherence to the terms of the con­

tract .

QUESTION:

That's been read into the statute, not­

withstanding the Norris-La Guardia Act -- ?
MR. GROSSMAN:

That is correct.

Under Boys Market.

12

We read it, in those limited situations that the Court out­

13

lined in Boys Market.

14

knowledged that even -- and one of the reasons maybe that it

15

was granted, that injunctive relief was granted in Boys

16

Market, was this Court's acknowledgment that even to permit

17

a damage action which happens when an employer sues a union

18

is not conducive to promoting industrial stability, and that

19

was a main purpose of the Act, to promote industrial stability

20

Now, you will not promote -- I maintain you will not promote

21

industrial stability by allowing the damage remedy action.

22

This Court, in Boys Market, also ac­

This petitioner has discharged employees, it's

QUESTION:

Well, of course, then a wildcat strike

also exacerbates industrial peace, doesn't it?
MR. GROSSMAN:

It does.

I'm not going to say that

it doesn't, but within two weeks -- and that's a long time

5

-- the entire matter was settled in terms of the, from the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. IAN HUNTER, ESQ.,

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL

16

MR. HUNTER:

Note that on page 25 of the Joint

17

Appendix the respondents admitted in the answer that the

18

local union did not authorize or condone the strike.

19

that's not at issue.

20

that the local union did not authorize the strike.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

So

Respondents admitted in their answer

Well, is that -- do you think that's

tantamount to admitting the union was not liable?
MR. HUNTER:

It certainly Is,

it admitted that

24

they did not condone it.

And we have no foundation of as­

25

serting they hadn't, based on our understanding of the facts.
45

The injunction did go against the employees.

The local union was only party to one of the three consoli­

3

dated lawsuits so the injunction was intended to go against

4

the employees in that the -QUESTION:

5

I think the -- I see a recitation in the

6

Court of Appeals opinion that the district court actually

7

found that the union had not authorized the strike.
MR. HUNTER:

That's right.

And it was found by

the court; right.
And the jurisdiction of a matter of this nature
