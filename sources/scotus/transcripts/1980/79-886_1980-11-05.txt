ON BEHALF.. OF THE PETITIONERS

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

in this case to rdview

of the Court of Appeals of the 6th Circuit in
in

applying the attorney-client privilege and

the work product rule sharply curtails the ability of a client
13

to obtain informed legal advice.
14

I shall devote the bulk of my argument to that part
15

of the decision which limits the scope of the attorney-client
16

privilege in the case of the corporation.

And thereafter I

17

will briefly discuss what is left of the work product issue in
18

the light of the Solicitor General's concession that the 6th
19

Circuit erred in holding that there was no such protection in
20

response to a summons from the Internal Revenue Service.
21

The court below held in the case of a corporation,
22

the attorney-client privilege protects only communications be­
23

tween a limited number of corporate officials and the corpora­
24

tion's lawyer, those officials being the ones who have the
25

authority to act for the corporation upon such advice as is

2

given by the lawyer.

Those circuits have adopted the so-called subject

12

The decision of the 7th Circuit adopting this sub­

13

ject matter test, Decker v. Harper S Row, was affirmed here

14

almost ten years ago by an equally divided Court.

15

It is

petitioner's contention that this test, the subject matter

test, is more consistent with the underlying purpose of the

17

attorney-client privilege in the administration of justice.

Now, this case arises in these circumstances.
Upjohn is a manufacturer and seller of pharmaceuticals in the
United States and some 150 foreign countries .

Early in 1976

Gerard Thomas, Upjohn's general counsel, who is also a director
and officer of the Company, was informed by the Company's
independent accountants that there was reason to believe that
some of Upjohn's foreign affiliates had made payments to or for
the benefit of foreign governmental officials in the promotion

25

4

1

of Upjohn business.

2

counsel and with the full support of the chairman of the board

3

set about conducting an investigation to put himself in a

4

position to render legal advice to the corporation concerning

5

all aspects of these payments, including the possibility of

6

civil and criminal litigation.

7

Mr. Thomas with the advice of outside

The investigation that Mr. Thomas and outside counsel

8

conducted consisted really of two parts.

9

naire prepared by them which was sent to some 53 managers

10

of Upjohn's foreign affiliates asking them to put down on

11

paper whatever knowledge they had about possible payments to

12

or for the benefit of foreign governments.

13

was advised that his response would be treated as confidential

14

and to this day it has been so treated.

15

One was a question­

Each of these men

Now, the second part of the investigation consisted

16

of interviews conducted by Mr. Thomas and outside counsel

17

some 86 employees of Upjohn and its subsidiaries which had

18

responsibility of one kind or another with respect to payments

19

made in foreign countries.

20
21

22
23
24

of

Some of those were within the

United States and some of them were outside the United States.
The interviewing lawyers made handwritten notes
during the course of those interviews.

The record shows that

those notes reflect factual information obtained from the
employees as well as the lawyers' impressions, conclusions,
opinions, and speculations at the time.

25

5

1

Shortly after this investigation was completed,

2

Upjohn filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange

3

Commission which described in generic terms without naming

4

countries or specific amounts that there had been some payments

5

That was the last heard from the SEC.

7

on the part of Upjohn.

8

At no time did the SEC

Now, a copy of this report was simultaneously sub­

9

mitted to the Internal Revenue Service.

10

commenced an investigation of Upjohn --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GRIBBON:

Thereupon the Service

By the SEC or by your client?
It was submitted by my client.

Upjohn

13

submitted it to the Internal Revenue Service at the same time

14

or simultaneously with the submission to the SEC.

15

Service very shortly thereafter commenced an investigation

16

of the tax years that were involved in this report and at the

17

24

25

The Revenue

very outset of its investigation, before any witnesses had
been interrogated, any documents examined, a special agent
served upon Mr. Thomas the summons in question here.

That

summons specifically asked for production of the questionnaires
that had been obtained from Upjohn's employees and for all of
the notes of interviews conducted by Upjohn.
QUESTION:

Is it your submission, Mr. Gribbon, that

both items requested were
MR. GRIBBON:

work product?

Yes.

QUESTION:

and'.one,

Yes.

And since I've already interrupted you,

1 1

quite apart from what the scope of the privilege may be in this

12

context or any other, who is the beneficiary of the privilege?

13

MR. GRIBBON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR.

The client; the corporation.

Not the lawyer, the client?
Yes.

It is the corporation and Mr. --

MR. GRIBBON:

There is that difference.

25

7

I don't think there

1

is any dispute on that one.

2

QUESTION:

Right.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Gribbon, while we have you inter­

All right.

4

rupted, does the record show how many of the interviewees have

5

been talked to by the Government?

6

MR. GRIBBON:

The record shows it to this extent,

7

at the time the summons was issued some 25 of the 86 inter­

8

viewees had been talked to by the Service.

9

since that time approximately 20 more have been talked to, so

I am informed that

10

that a number, but less than half, have been interrogated by

1 1

the Internal Revenue Service.

12

QUESTION:

13
14

So that the Service has found a way to

get to them?
MR. GRIBBON:

Well, they should have.

They appar­

15

ently are not satisfied that they have found a way, and this

16

is really the point I want to make here, that during the

17

course of this investigation and before an action was filed in

18

court to enforce the summons, Upjohn cooperated with the

19

Internal Revenue Service and really gave them everything they

20

could reasonably ask for except the questionnaires and the

21

lawyers' notes, and responded to almost 300 document requests.

22
23
24

25

They gave them a list of the people who had been interviewed
and had submitted questionnaires, told them what their posi­
tions were, cooperated in permitting them to be examined.
On one point they did have a difference with the
8

1

Revenue Service.

2

that they instructed their witnesses not to respond to ques­

3

tions that did not have an impact on Upjohn's United States

4

income tax returns.

That is, Upjohn's lawyers took the position

Now, the Revenue Service never did pursue that

5

6

matter.

They never

sought

7

witness and indeed subsequently the Service in a published

8

opinion just really acquiesced, substantially, in that position

9

that '.is ; the

s.cope

of

the . summons directed to the

the inquiry of the Internal Revenue

10

Service, something that has to do with U.S. income taxes.

1 1

Ultimately, of course, this action was filed in

12

court

seeking

13

tionnaire and the interview notes.
QUESTION:

14

15

Mr. Gribbon, one minor detail.

MR. GRIBBON:

But no answers yet?;.
No answers.

The District Court adoptee,

the view of a magistrate to whom he had referred this matter,
which held that the control group test should apply as far
as the attorney-client privilege was concerned, and further
that none of the people who had been interviewed or sent
questionnaires were within the control group.

He also found

that there had been a showing of need on the part of the
9

1

Service for the work product and directed that all of the

2

interviews and questionnaires be turned over to the Internal

3

Revenue Service.

4

The Court of Appeals affirmed the finding of the

5

District Court and the magistrate so far as the control group

6

test was concerned.

7

whether any members of this group could be regarded as within

8

the control group.

Now, on brief -- I'll treat this briefly -- the

Solicitor General has tendered two reasons why he says,

18

acquiescence in the grant of the

25

writ

I submit that

that neither of them

has merit.
It is now urged that the investigation conducted
by Mr. Thomas, Upjohn's general counsel, with the assistance
of outside counsel, was not for the purpose of rendering
legal advice.

Now, this contention was not even advanced by

any of the government people in the courts below.

The magis­

trate found, as did both the District Court and the Court of
10

1

Appeals, that the purpose of the investigation Was to put

2

Mr. Thomas in the position to render legal advice to the

3

corporation with respect to all of these matters.

4

finding is amply supported by the record and there is no

5

evidence to the contrary.
QUESTION:

And that

If Mr. Thomas, even though he'd gone to

7

law school were, say, vice president in charge of personnel,

8

and had sent out this questionnaire, would -MR. GRIBBON:

And that could have bderi delegated, at least argu­

ably, just as well to the vice-president in charge of finance?
11

1

MR. GRIBBON:

2

as human beings are concerned -QUESTION:

3

I think conceivably, at least as far

Even though that vice president might be

4

a member of the bar somewhere, he wouldn't be acting as a

5

lawyer.

6

He was getting factual information.
MR. GRIBBON:

But I think that Mr. Thomas as a

7

trained lawyer and the Company's chief lawyer, particularly

8

with the assistance of outside counsel, was in a far better

9

position to ask the right questions and to get the answers, anc

10

to formulate what was necessary for him to give the corporation

1 1

truly decent legal advice.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GRIBBON:

14

15
16
17

18
19

20

21
22

Weren't they factual inquiries?
They were factual, largely, but inqui­

ries as to when did you do it, who was present, were you aware
of the laws, things of that kind, the very things that a law­
yer would do when

a

client walks into the office

and says,

I may be in trouble here.
QUESTION:

Other people might do it too.

MR. GRIBBON:

But I don't think they do it as well,

Your Honor, and that's why the privilege has been given to the
lawyer and not to the financial adviser.
QUESTION:

What did you do, and when did you do it?

MR. GRIBBON:

No, that's a preliminary question, but

23

in asking him what he does he maybe comes up with something.
24

Well, I was there, I wasn't there, so-and-so was there, three
25

12

1

other people were there.

2

are factual inquiries.

3

QUESTION:

In all legal investigations there

Are you saying that the first thing a

4

lawyer should do when he is confronted with a problem by a

5

client is to get the facts?

6

MR. GRIBBON:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

10
1 1

I am, Your Honor.

And then he can't have any opinion about

the law until he has some facts to which to apply the law?
MR. GRIBBON:

Or any opinion he has about the law

without the necessary facts isn't worth very much.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gribbon, what if the general counsel

12

without the authorization of the board simply felt that

13

there's something wrong here and I'm going to blow the whistle

14

on this board because I think they're covering up some stuff,

15

and went around and conducted exactly the same interviews?

16

Would you claim the same privilege for him then?

17

18
19

20
21

22

MR. GRIBBON:

If he was acting for the corporation

and I think in the case you have given he would be acting for
the best interests of the corporation, I think the corporation
would have the privilege.

Now, he wouldn't be able to waive

it, but the corporation would have the privilege for whatever
materials and whatever opinions and whatever impressions he
gathered; with respect to his inquiry.

23
24

QUESTION:

What would happen if you get two corpo­

rations and one gets his general counsel to do it and another
25

13

1

one gets its vice president who is not a lawyer to do the

2

exact same thing?

3

is not.

One's governed by one rule and the other

MR. GRIBBON:

4

I think the indications are that in

5

that situation where a senior official not a lawyer did the

6

job that no privilege would attach.
QUESTION:

7

And then the next corporation did the

8

exact same thing with a man who happened to be a member of the

9

bar?

10

MR. GRIBBON:

1 1

12

MR. GRIBBON:

But I say -- well, It might be or it

To the client it would be the same.

MR. GRIBBON:

17

The same question now.

That's -QUESTION:

16

More than a member of the bar?

Well, if you'd --

If you buy that, you're going to be'.in

I can't hold you to it.
MR. GRIBBON:

I can't hold you.

If a finance president can do exactly,

20

the same job that a. trained lawyer

can

do, then I have to

21

go along with your answer.

But the theory on which the privilege:

22

has

been

there, the theory on which lawyers work is that they

23

bring some insight, they bring some skill to this matter, in

5

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Mr. Gribbon, supposing when he got all

7

through when his investigation, he said to the president, my

advice to you is to fire the ten branch managers.

Would the

10

MR. GRIBBON:

I think the privilege would survive as

1 1

to the communications.

I'm not sure that there's privilege on

12

the advice, fire the 10 managers. But I think on the communi­

13

cations that the managers I presume you're speaking of, Your

14

Honor, may --

15

QUESTION:

What I'm really inquiring is, how do we

16

know whether the advice that this executive, who is both a

17

lawyer and an executive, gives is properly considered

18

advice, because it may well be kind of a blend of management

19

and legal advice?

20

MR. GRIBBON:

Well, I suppose that's probably true

21

even if an outside counsel had done it entirely.

22

airtight compartments.

23
24

25

legal

We're not in

But in this case, where there clearly

were legal problems, not only domestic tax problems, SEC
problems, shareholder suits, but local problems in the country
in which they were operating, you clearly needed a trained
15

1

lawyer to find the facts and assess them.

2

Mr. Thomas did.

3

suggesting is an in camera examination by a judge to see whe­

4

ther the matters that were here are privileged or not.

5

I think most judges prefer not to do that and I think in this

6

case it wasn't necessary and it wasn't done.

7

of it, what Mr. Thomas assisted by outside counsel was doing

8

was a lawyer's job and not -- he's not a financial man anyway.

10

I suppose the ultimate answer to what you're

QUESTION:

9

below, I take it, whether it was legal advice or not?
MR. GRIBBON:

12

QUESTION:

14

But on the face

But this is -- this wasn't the rationale

1 1

13

And that's what

No.

But the Government would like to make

it -MR. GRIBBON:

The

Government now feels that they'd

15

like to back away from the scope question by saying it wasn't

16

legal advice.

17

I submit that it is .clearly

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

That's a rather late entry in the matter and
on . this record in both the

courts below and the magistrate, who were not particularly
sympathetic to Upjohn's position, assumed and found that it
was legal advice.
QUESTION:

Do you think the Government is entitled tc

make, as a respondent entitled to make this argument?

Or would

it change their relief?
MR. GRIBBON:

I think they're probably entitled.

I believe under the decisions of this Court they can make
25

16

1

almost any kind of an argument of this kind.

2

QUESTION::

3

MR. GRIBBON:

Unless it would expand their relief.
No, I don't think it would, necessar­

4

ily.

5

their, tardiness in bringing :it forth is a very good indication

6

of the validity of the argument that they're putting to you.

It's just another ground.

QUESTION:

7

I raise it because I think

Well, they couldn't rely on it at all if

8

they had not preserved it on their appeal from the District

9

Court to the Court of Appeals.
MR. GRIBBON:

10

Well, they didn't, they didn't preserve:

1 1

the matter of whether it was legal advice or not.

12

into the case in the Supreme Court in the respondent's brief.

13

Now,

14

Government below but it was rejected by the Court of Appeals.

15

The second reason they have suggested for not getting to the

16

scope of the privilege is that Upjohn by cooperating with the

17

Internal Revenue Service and giving them various facts

18

regarding these payments waived the privilege.

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

That came

the graver point, the second point, was made by the

And to that

one, the law is clear that it is only when you give up communi-,
cations that you are in a position to waiver, and not simply
when you give facts that may have been disclosed, may have beer,
obtained,

even in the course of an investigation.

But on

that one the Court of Appeals did find against them, and there
was nothing in their response to the Petition for cert, which
said anything about that point.
17

1

In that respect, the lower federal courts have re­

2

cently in a number of opinions said.that where a corporation

3

or anybody else is voluntarily cooperating with the law en­

4

forcement authorities, that that in and of itself would not

5

be regarded as a waiver of whatever privilege that they might

6

have.
But, basically, the waiver comes down to waiving

7

8

something that was communicated, and that wasn't done here.

9

I submit, therefore, that the Court should proceed to resolve

10
1 1

this matter of the scope of the privilege which has bred con­
fusion in the lower courts for about 20 years now.
And while this case involves a corporation, I submit

12

13
14

15
16

there is no reason in principle why what is decided here should
not be equally applicable to any other organization whose
structure is such that many people can act for it and bind it,
but only a relatively few are able to make the decisions.
Now, examples of such organizations would be agencies

17

18

of the Federal Government, labor unions, fraternal organiza­
tions.

This point is particularly emphasized in the brief

19

filed here on behalf of the Federal Bar Association, which
20

If the control group test were to be

adopted, I am sure there will be a great deal of professional
frustration on the part of lawyers in trying to advise corpo­
rations .
But the real losers, if that test is applied, is not
going to be the lawyers.

QUESTION:

Do you think it would have a tendency to

lead lawyers to write less and have long distance telephone

MR. GRIBBON:

5

I think it would, Your Honor.

I can't

6

say certainly that it would but it seems to me that if every­

7

thing they do in advising their client is going to be turned

over to their adversary, it's just human nature that they're

Two reasons, basically, as I understand it in all

16
17

18
19

20

that has been written about the control group test since
Judge Kirkpatrick first set it out about 20 years ago, two
reasons appear to be what come forward as the reason why the
control group test should be adopted.
First of these

21
22
23
24

The ethics call for them to be can­

for it.

It

is; simply that there's no necessity

is1 argued that corporate employees, unlike

other individuals, will speak candidly, voluntarily, whether
there's a privilege or not.

They don't have the apprehensions

of ordinary individuals, or if they do, they will subordinate
25

20

1

them to the will of the superior officer.
Now, I think one looks back at the privilege itself

2
3

insofar as an individual is concerned, it probably never could

4

be established that in fact the privilege is necessary in order1

5

to encourage people to be candid and frank with their lawyers.

6

There are a! lot of..reasons apart, from the privilege which would

7

indicate such candor.

8

people do not speak candidly.

have embraced the notion that it is helpful not to the indi­

their lawyer is not going to be used the next day against

14

them.

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

22

So therefore, I think the no necessity argument
really is without merit.

It is true, as the proponents of

the control test urge, that the employee does not get complete
protection.

The protection

the client protects, the privilege

is not his, it's the corporation's.

That is true, of course,

not only of the subordinate employees but also of the manage­
ment employees.

And just because they're management today

doesn't mean that they're going to be management tomorrow,
because the directors are not going to waive that privilege.

23

The privilege is for the benefit of the corporation.

But in

24

this respect the employees are in this position of tension
25

21

1

between their individual likes and dislikes and those of the

2

organizations to which they belong,-but it's not at all

17

18

Because the corporation as you

I think that's right.

suggest it was so abstract,

the board

I didn't mean to

but there are a lot of different

people that are involved and ultimately, I presume, the share­
holders.

And in some instances shareholders have come in

and waived the privilege.

That isn't so likely in a big,

publicly held corporation, but it's not impossible.

And cer­

tainly the directors, certainly a new management can come In,
so that on this ground there is really no solid basis for
distinguishing between the subordinate employees who fairly
frequently will have the facts that are necessary to give
informed information, and the top management people.

Neither

19

group has complete protection in the way that an individual
20

does.

But they do have some protection, and experience shows

21

that it has been exceedingly helpful in obtaining their
cooperation and experience shows that in most instances the
corporation does not lightly waive that privilege.

It behaves

as Upjohn is behaving here, zealously guarding the privilege
22

1

of some 80 employees throughout the world.
The second argument that is made for the control

2
3

group test is something in the nature of saying that it hides

4

facts from discovery and it also enables the top management to

5

close its eyes to disagreeable facts.

6

argument, I submit, though it has often been made it is without

merit, because the privilege does not hide facts from dis­

The privilege generally carries both the

So

the privilege, quite apart again from the particular scope of
the privilege with respect to a corporate client, the privilege
generally covers the two-way communications brtween lawyer and
client ?
23

MR. GRIBBON:

Yes, Your Honor.

And that is the way

2

that we would have it interpreted here.

3

say that in this case, rather than hindering the Internal

4

Revenue Service in its efforts, what Upjohn has given to the

5

Internal Revenue Service as a result of this precautionary

investigation that it undertook, has given them an ideal

short of that, and in most instances that's one of the risks

1 1

that a corporation takes when it embarks on an investigation

of this sort.

13

Now, so far as insulating the top management from

14

disagreeable facts, I submit that that is sheer speculation.

There was no evidence of that in this case, there's no evi­

But

I would submit that whatever changes are made in the rela­

public interest is still going to require that observance of

best served by having a corporation get a full opportunity to

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9

MR. WALLACE:

10
1 1

12

Mr. Wallace?

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The principal question before the Court is how to

13

accommodate the attorney-client privilege to the corporate

14

form of doing business.

15

Analytically, at one logical extreme, the privilege

16

would not apply at all to corporations, because it's only

17

the corporation who is the client and it is only to the entity

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

that the lawyer owes his professional responsibility and the
communications by necessity are with individuals to whom the
lawyer does not owe this kind of fiduciary responsibility.
We do not advocate this approach to it, but this is
one analytical, logical extreme.

At the other logical extreme,

all communications between an attorney for the entity and any
employee of the entity would be privileged. Because the entity
can communicate only through its employees, this would result

25

25

1

in a much more expansive scope of the privilege in the corpo­

2

rate form of doing business than what we understand the privi­

3

lege to be with respect to employees of a proprietorship or

4

of a partnership and indeed, what the Court in Hickman v. Tay­

5

lor understood the scope of the privilege to be with respect

6

to employees of a partnership.

7

9

QUESTION:

Doesn't the privilege extend to any agent

of a client who's acting as an agent of the client?
MR. WALLACE:

Acting as an agent.

But there is con­

10

siderable ambiguity in the law about that.

1 1

to get to that a little bit later on, but there's a difference

12

between acting as an agent and communicating what the client

13

knows and wishes to communicate.

The graphic example is the

Imparting his own impressions.

MR. WALLACE:

-- himself

—

imparting his own

knowledge that the client may not know.
QUESTION:

Which the principal may not know.

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

And there has been

much confusion in analysis about this.
Between the two extremes that I have posed, no ap­
proach to accommodating the privilege to the corporate form of
doing business is without some analytical inconsistency.

23

And yet we think that a reasonable accommodation should be
24

made, and that the privilege does apply, and the courts have
25

26

1

2
3
4

strained to make a reasonable accommodation.
QUESTION:

We're dealing here only with a proposed

evidentiary rule in the federal courts.
MR. WALLACE:

Is that correct?

That is correct, Mr. Justice, under

5

Rule 501 of the Rules of Evidence this Court and the other

6

federal courts are to apply the common law interpreted in the

7

light of reason and experience to federal question cases.

8

QUESTION:

And that's -- those are the metes and

9

bounds of our inquiry.

10

MR. WALLACE:

1 1

12

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20

That is the metes and bounds.

Now,

there is an attraction for the legal profession, one might
even say a temptation, to take an expansive view of this par­
ticular privilege, a view that would encourage communication
as much as possible to attorneys and thus enable them to
Improve their representation of clients, and incidentally
reduce the possibilities that they may have to be in the
capacity of witnesses at any time.
QUESTION:

Can a lawyer from whom advice is sought

properly perform his function if there isn't a complete
and free flow of information, factual material from the
client to the attorney, whether it's a corporation, an indi­

21

vidual, or whatever?
22

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the lawyer has to get informatior

23

from whatever sources he can and of course -24

QUESTION:

But isn't the primary source the client

25

27

1

in most cases?
MR. WALLACE:

2

It is the primary source, but the

3

point I was about to make, Mr. Chief Justice, was that indeed

4

the information that the lawyer is able to secure and the

5

services

6

would be enhanced if the privilege were to extend to third

7

party witnesses that the lawyer wants to interview in doing

8

the client's business, and it has never been contended that

9

the privilege extends that far.
Our position is that the proper starting point in

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

that he would be able to perform for the client

approaching the question of how best to accommodate it is the
starting point that this Court has used with respect to all
privileges, and that is that the public has the right to
every man's evidence and that each privilege should be con­
strued no more broadly than necessary to protect the weighty
and legitimate competing interest.

This is the approach that

has been used in construing the President's executive privi­
lege and construing privileges asserted on behalf of the
press
QUESTION:

Well, you don't have to go outside of

20

the attorney-client field for a precedent, do you?

How about

21

Cardozo's opinion in United States v. Clark, where he says that
22

if the information communicated suggests fraud or crime, it's
23

not privileged.
24

MR. WALLACE:

Well, indeed, in a more recent opinion

25

28

1

this Court said that the same principle applies to this

2

privilege and to the legal profession, and that is an issue

3

against the United States.

4

a view toward the need to encourage legal advice to corpora­

5

tions and to encourage corporate self-regulation and with a

6

view toward concerns of the Federal Government itself, we

concluded after a survey of the views of a large number of

8

government agencies -- I might say, an unusually large number

9

in preparing the brief for this Court -- to ask this Court to

It's the test that has been adopted by the Uniform

Rules of Evidence, which six states have adopted by statute
during the 1970s.

MR. WALLACE:

So that's the way it went to Congress?
That's the way it went to Congress.

I think directly because of this Court's decision.
Indeed, the 8th Circuit's en banc decision in

And both of them have adopted the

31

1

The court below is the second of these.

of the courts to do this was the 3rd Circuit in 1979 in an

3

opinion by Chief Judge Seitz, a former chancellor of the

State of Delaware, who is certainly one of the most informed

5

judges on the federal bench about the realities of corporate

life, and of corporate legal practice.
QUESTION:

19

And it was a replacement, or at the time

it was being considered as

an alternative that was con­

sidered was the Radiant Burners test of no privilege at all.
So there isn't really any law :in common law that supports it.
MR. WALLACE:

17

18

You are correct, Mr. Justice.

There's not a law in common law but we

have to under Section 501 use whatever common law has been
developed.
QUESTION:

Well, what was the test or was there be­

20

fore that, before the control group test was invented?
21

MR. WALLACE:

Other than what Mr. Justice Stevens

22

has suggested, the possibility that there was no privilege at
23

all, there really hadn't been developed any test in the

corporate context.

MR. WALLACE:

5

I'm not aware of it, Mr. Justice.

Other than Radiant Burner I'm not

6

aware of early law on the question.

7

most legal writings have proceeded on the; assumption that you

know who the client is and it's the communications from the cli

MR. WALLACE:

Yes, that is correct.

It's possible

that the Court's decision here could be distinguished in some
way in a future case, depending on how it s written, but
nothing has occurred to me that wouldn't require the Court to
consider the rationale of the two principal tests that have
been developed, other than the alternative grounds for

affirmance, which we have raised.

But we're not urging the

2

Court to avoid the principal question on which it granted

certiorari.

of what was presented here.

QUESTION:

May I ask one other question -- two kind

7

of factual questions, if I may.
8

First of all, do you have the identity of the people
9

who received the questionnaires for the Government?
10

MR. WALLACE:

I believe so.

1 1

QUESTION:

Is there any reason why the Government

12

couldn't have — it has the questionnaire,

I understand.

13

It couldn't have just sent the same questionnaire to all these
14

people?

I was wondering what --

15

MR. WALLACE:

If we have the current addresses.

I'm

16

not sure we have the current addresses.

Some

of them are no

they would not be under legal compulsion to answer them, nor
would we have any way of knowing whether the answers are the
same as the answers that they gave to Mr. Thomas.
QUESTION:

No, but presumably they'd be truthful

answers; that's all.
MR. WALLACE:

If they were answered.

There is

testimony to the effect that the Company has instructed them
not to disclose anything except with respect to those
34

1

transactions that the Company has decided bear on the Company's

tax liabilities.

3

The problem with these payments is that for the

4

most part they're to third persons -- and what the Company was

5

trying to -- rather than to government officials.

6

Company was trying to find out, according to its testimony,

7

whether those were legitimate commissions; to non-governmental

persons or whether those persons were in effect a conduit for

payment to a public official.

And the

And the Company having sorted o>ut for itself, is

asking the Internal Revenue Service to accept its judgment

12

about which ones may be pertinent to its tax liability.

13

QUESTION:

May I also ask, on the interview aspect

14

of the inquiry, it's the Government's view, I gather, that if

these people had been, say, grand jury witnesses or something

like that, but junior employees,

after testifying before a grand jury for the purpose of

The opinion of the 3rd Circuit, to which I want to

And if I may, I'd like to refer briefly to some

interspersed with some comments of our own.
QUESTION:

Does this direct itself to both the

privilege and to the work product?
MR. WALLACE:

It does not relate to the work

product question, although work product is referred to in
the course of the discussion.
And the first thing that the Court of Appeals
recognizes is that criticism of the control group test usually
begins with the observation that in the corporate setting the
people who know the relevant facts and the people who make the
decisions are seldom the same.

And if an attorney is to give

sound advice to the control group, he must secure information
from outside the control group.
And the Court says,

"Although we agree that an attor­

ney often needs to secure information from lower echelon
employees, we are not convinced that extension of the corpora-

36

1

tion’s attorney-client privilege would enhance his or her

2

ability to secure that information.

3

ed to non-control group employees would be quite illusory

4

from their standpoint, because they have no control over the

5

privilege itself.

6

only in the sense that they are not released to outsiders, and

7

only as long as the corporate control group desires to assert

8

the privilege.

9

The confidentiality offer­

Their communications remain confidential

"If the employees had engaged ini questionable activity

10

the corporation clearly would have the power to waive the

1 1

privilege and to turn the employees ' statements over to law

12

enforcement officials.

13
14

15

"Privilege or no privilege, low/er level employees
would confide in corporate counsel at their own risk.

Con­

versely, where no questionable activity is involved, non-con­

16

trol group employees have little reason ruot to relate informa­

17

tion to corporate counsel, especially where a superior has

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

instructed them to do so."
Now, this seems to us to be directly relevant to
the usual approach of trying to determine whether a substantia],
and weighty competing interest requires a privilege to be
more broadly construed than its applicability to those who
have the authority to seek the advice of counsel, to act on the.
advice that is sought, and indeed to waive the privilege.
Ordinarily, in a lawyer-client relationship, the

25

37

1

attorney can disclose the confidential communication to no one

2

else. Here you start off on the premise that it's being

3

secured in order to be disclosed to other higher officials in

4

the corporation, or in this case, perhaps, to be acted on by

5

the general counsel himself in one of his other capacities.
QUESTION:

6

Would you think that in some circum­

7

stances, Mr. Wallace, the lawyer would be precluded from even

8

conceding or responding with an answer that he was representing

9

the client?
MR. WALLACE:

10

Well, that is what the American Bar

1 1

Association is now struggling with in revising the Code of

12

Ethics that was adopted as recently as 1970, but one of the

13

shortcomings that the committee working on them now has found

14

15
16
17

is that it doesn't adequately address this problem of who is
the client, and the draft now being circulated includes a
provision for giving a so-called Miranda-type warning to the
employee when counsel is interviewing the employee so that the
employee knows that he's not really going to have1 the benefits

18
19

of the confidential communication.
QUESTION:

Well, I'm thinking of a situation specifi­

20
21

cally where a government agent would come to a lawyer and say,
I want to talk to you about this client, naming the client.

22

And first, I understand you are representing this man or this
23

company.

Is the lawyer free or not free to say, I will not

24

discuss anything with you including whether I am or whether I
25

38

1

2

am not representing him?
MR. WALLACE:

My understanding is that the attorney-

3

client privilege never has extended to the fact of representa­

4

tion, that it did not protect from disclosure whether or not

the attorney represented the individual.

QUESTION:

Well, surely, many lawyers have acted on

that assumption that they would not respond to any questions
about whether they represented a given client.
MR. WALLACE:
Mr. Chief Justice.

If they did, they were in error,

But as I say, it's not a matter we looked

into with reference to this case.

The attorney in this case

is the attorney for the corporation.
QUESTION:

But it bears on how far the relationship

can be penetrated, does it not?
MR. WALLACE:

They can be --

I always thought that it did not extend

either to the identity of the client or to the fees, if I
recollect the law correctly.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, under the subject matter

test, if the lawyer makes the investigation and collects the
statements from the witnesses and then writes an opinion letter
to a member of the control group who asked him to do it , and

23

who had told the employees to cooperate, he writes a letter
24

but he attaches all the statements.
25

39

Are those statements

1

privileged in the hands of the member of the control group

2

from discovery from that member by the Government?

3

MR. WALLACE:

I think that's an arguable question

4

under the subject matter test.

5

the subject matter test.
QUESTION:

6

You posited the question under

Mr. Wallace, suppose a member of the

7

control group himself had carried out the investigation and

8

had collected all the statements from the witnesses, surely

9

you could get them then?

10

MR. WALLACE:

1 1

QUESTION:

.
Surely.

But instead he tells the lawyer to gather

12

them, and the lawyer gathers them and then gives them to the

13

control group member.
MR. WALLACE:

14
15
16

that using the attorney as a conduit in that fashion would not
insulate from discovery, what would otherwise be discoverable.

you'd

that,

Mr.

Wallace.,

under either test?
MR. WALLACE:

20

Well, we would certainly want to argue

Under either test we would make that

argument.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, this question arises, I sup­

pose, most frequently, or at least frequently, not in the
international context of this case but rather in the more
mundane case of a truck owned by the corporation getting in­
volved in an automobile accident or a products liability claim
40

1

or something like that, in which the lawyer is going to talk

2

to the employees of the corporation that are directly involved,

3

and probably the top officers or directors of the corporation

4

don't know or care anything about that particular lawsuit.

How would your test apply there?

MR. WALLACE:

13

Well, I think the: control group with

14

respect to that question is whoever in the corporation has the

15

authority to direct counsel as to what to> do in the case,

16

whether to settle for a certain figure or to litigate, or

something.

18

QUESTION:

Well, nobody directs -- the foreman, the

22
23

25

Nobody’who's very high in the corporation

MR. WALLACE:

Well, someone has directed the foreman

about who will represent the corporation in these circumstances
so that the foreman knows what to say to the person on the
other side and it seems to me that the control group has to be

the decision with respect to how the litigation should be

QUESTION:

The contention that in some way the use of legal

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. GRIBBON, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL

7

MR. GRIBBON:

8

I should like to remark on two matters covered by

9

opposing counsel.

May it please the Court:

First, Mr. Justice White, in answer to your

10

question, there was law before Radiant Burners and Judge

it was consistent with what had been in the law before then.
Now, it is this distinction' of, who is the .client and
who is the witness or observer that I think is basically in­
correct in the control group test, because I don't think it
meets the question that the lawyer has got to be completely

2

talking with those who were doing the questioned action --
