ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. LEE REEVES, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. REEVES:

8
9

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent Petitioner J. Truett Payne Company.

10
1 1

We filed this secondary line Robinson-Patman Act price dis­

12

crimination case, resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor

13

of the petitioner.

14

standing verdict was denied, in the 5th Circuit

15

pealed and the 5th Circuit reversed on the grounds that the

16

plaintiff, petitioner in this instance, must prove the spe­

17

cific lost sales or lost profits.

18

of proving the fact of the injury. And a second and underlying

19

factor in the reversal was that the petitioner failed to

20

prove a reasonable estimate of the amount of the price dis­

21

crimination or damage and that the actual amount of the dis­

22

crimination was not sufficient

23

timate the damage, or by which the jury could estimate the

24

damage.

25

After a motion for judgment notwith­
it was ap­

And that is the only methoc

by which the court could es­

This Court is faced with the damage issues under the
3

1

Robinson-Patman Act and Section 4 of the Clayton Act, which

2

bring into focus the 5th Circuit's requirement of a plaintiff

3

proving specific lost profits or lost sales as the only means

4

of recovering under the Robinson-Patman Act, and whether or

5

not that requirement imposes an inflated standard of proof

6

thereby effectively denying private attorney generals the

7

Ability

8

wrong; and secondly, whether or not the amount of the price

9

differential is sufficient evidence to give a reasonable and

10
1 1

to

enforce

the

Act

and

recover

for

a

proper estimate of the amount of the damage.
The 5th Circuit in its opinion misconstrues not

12

only the law but I believe in misconstruing the law underlying

13

the problem

14

that Payne claimed that in a total vacuum price discrimina­

15

tion alone was sufficient to give rise to an injury under

16

Section 4 of the Act, of the Clayton Act.

17

was misconstruing Payne's position.

It stated

And I submit that that is the basis upon which the

18

court totally ignored this Court's findings and holdings in

19

Bruce's Juices case, in 1947, and the FTC v. Morton Salt

20

case in 1948.

21

QUESTION:

Well, do you concede that findings of

22

discrimination under the Act, without any evidence suffi­

23

cient to survive a motion for a directed verdict,dealing with

24

causation and damage, would be insufficient to support a

25

monetary award?
4

1

MR. REEVES:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would say

2

that if price discrimination alone with absolutely no other

3

evidence is the only evidence before the Court, then I would

4

say that that's true; that price discrimination in a vacuum

5

cannot be found to cause injury.

6

QUESTION:

Well, what about price discrimination

7

plus the fact that the two customers are competitive?

8

Is that enough?

9

10

MR. REEVES:

I think you have got to go farther.

I would not mind that finding.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. REEVES:

Well, I wouldn't think you would; yes.
But I would submit to Your Honor,

13

Mr. Justice White, that in this case there was substantial

14

corroborating evidence supporting an inference of injury

15

resulting from substantial price discrimination taking place,

16

occurring in a market where there was keen competition and

17

in the face of tight profit margins, and where the substan­

18

tial price discrimination could have been reflected in the

19

retail sales price.

20

Circuit didn't address that, it just said, the only way that

21

you could prove injury is to show proof of lost sales and

22

lost profits, but under the circumstances in this case the

23

jury, the fact finder, whether it be a jury or a court, could

24

have inferred injury from the existence of those factors, plus

25

the price discrimination itself.

Now, under those circumstances the 5th

5

So, in answer to your question, I think that this

1

2

Court need not address whether or not price discrimination

3

standing alone in a vacuum gives rise to injury or competi­

4

tive injury.

5

tial supporting -- substantial corroborating evidence sup­

6

porting not only the proof of actual competitive injury, not

7

just a finding of a likelihood or probability of injury,

8

but testimony that competition itself was harmed,

9

port an inference that would support the jury's finding which

Because the facts of this case show a substan­

and sup­

10

could give rise to an inference of damage to the disfavored

1 1

purchaser.

12

QUESTION:

Do you think that Mr. Payne's testimony

13

itself without the testimony of Dr. Ignatin would have re­

14

quired the district court to submit the case to the jury on

15

the issue of damages and required it to accept an award of

16

damages that was within the range of his testimony?

17

MR. REEVES:

Under the -- no other rebutting evi­

18

dence whatsoever, yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I do. Because

19

that would then be a case where you would have price dis­

20

crimination, not in a vacuum, but disregarding Mr. Payne's

21

testimony, which the 5th Circuit discounts by saying that

22

this is a conclusion of one of the injured parties, I still

23

say that It is corroborating evidence which put together

24

with the vast amount of other corroborating evidence would

25

permit at least, at the very least, the jury to determine
6

1

the fact of whether or not there was damage.

2

Circuit says, it doesn't address these other -QUESTION:

3

And the 5th

Well, what if you have only these two

4

questions on the damage issue,

5

by Mr. Payne's counsel, "Mr. Payne, were you damaged by this

6

price discrimination?"

7

much?"

8

submissible to the jury on the damage issue and sustainable?

9

Answer:

Answer:

"$75,000."

MR. REEVES:

and they're put to Mr. Payne

"Yes."

Question:

"How

End of direct; no cross.

Is that

I believe, under even the standards

10

that this Court has established on proof of damage and proof

11

of amount of damage, that you would have to go farther than

12

just mere self-serving conclusions in the absence of any other

13

supporting evidence.

14

However, if -- like in this case -- the amounts of

15

the price discriminations which resulted -- Chrysler, in a

16

rebate program -- let me just go into the background just a

17

moment, if it please the court.

18

Rebate programs were formulated by Chrysler whereby

19

the amount of money that was paid to the competing dealers

20

in the Birmingham market was determined by a quota that was

21

reached, or not reached, by the competing dealers.

22

were different for each dealer, and the price rebate would

23

thereby lower the price and cause the discrimination, if

24

everybody were not rebated the same price on the same model

25

automobile.
7

The quotas

1

And in this case there was evidence of substantial

2

amounts of discrimination occurring, sometimes several hundred

3

dollars per automobile, in a period -- we're talking about

4

50 or more automobiles a month, and these rebate programs

5

lasted two and three months in duration.

6

that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, together with Mr. Payne's testi­

7

mony, the actual fact of the price discrimination, the dura­

8

tion of the substantial nature of it, and the amounts of it,

9

then I say that that would be an issue that should be sub­

So, when you put

10

mitted to the trier of fact, as to whether or not the trier of

11

fact could infer damage without proof of specific lost sales

12

or lost profits.

13

The testimony in this case showed that during a

14

3-1/2-year period from approximately December, 1970 --

15

November, 1973 -- May, 1974, when Payne went out of business,

16

that the price discrimination totalled about $81,000.

17

There were 16 rebate programs which caused the price discrimi­

18

nation, and of those 16 programs 13 caused damage to Payne,

19

and that damaged -- that Payne was not favored, he was a dis­

20

favored dealer in those 13.

21

one of the programs was a program that had a quota establishec

22

by Chrysler by which the dealer had to reach that quota in

23

order to get paid and Payne reached that one quota and did

24

not get injured in that program.

25

where there was no discrimination were an across-the-board

Of those other three programs,

The other two programs

1

percentage rebate to everybody on a per car basis, so there

2

was no discrimination at all.

3

over a 3-1/2-year period, Payne was injured, was a disfavored

4

dealer in 13 of them.

So, out of those 16 programs

There was testimony not only by Payne that

5

his

6

company lost business in the form of lost sales, but also

7

that his company in order to maintain sales had to overallow

8

on the used car tradein, and that was a factor in the testi­

9

mony of Dr. Ignatin and in the testimony, as

a matter of

10

fact, of Chrysler's witnesses which analyzed the used car

1 1

business of Payne, saying that, one, that the main problem

12

with Payne was its used car business was losing money.

13

So you've got the fact that Payne testified that he was over­

14

allowing in order to get business coupled with the corrobo­

15

rating testimony that there was a real problem in the used

16

car business, coupled with a factor of substantial, sustained

17

price discriminations over 3-1/2 years.

18

of an actual decline in the market, percentage of the market

19

that Payne had from 1971 and 1972.

There was testimony

There was also testimony that the price discrimina­

20
21

tion adversely affected competition and injured competition

22

because it had a two-pronged effect.

23

it did not permit Payne to compete on an even and equal

24

basis.

25

more than the other competing dealers.

The first thing was that

He was at a trade disadvantage because his cars cost

9

1

Secondly, the price of a new car is determined by

2

the discounting off of the list price, and everybody knows

3

that, and the economist that analyzed the industry in

4

Birmingham determined that because the competing dealers,

5

the favored dealers, did not have to discount off list price

6

quite as much as they otherwise would have since they were

7

favored and Payne was not favored with the rebate, with the

8

price discrimination, and because Payne could,, not discount off

9

list price as much as he otherwise would have done because

10

of the lack of the price rebate, that that raised the price,

11

the ultimate retail price to the consumer in the market to

12

a slight degree.

13

And the 5th Circuit in its opinion did not consider

14

all of this evidence as giving rise at least to the submis­

15

sion to a jury as to whether or not injury in fact under

16

the antitrust laws could be caused.

17

that the only way you can prove injury is to prove lost

18

profits or lost sales.

19

The 5th Circuit said

This Court considered the same issue in a different

20

context in Bruce's Juices v. American Can Company, and in that

21

case, although the ultimate finding was much narrower, the

22

Court was faced with an analysis exactly the same as in this

23

case, because the plaintiff in that case had said that the

24

price discrimination statute ought to void the contract in­

25

volved in the transaction where there was price discrimination.
10

1

The court said, and the plaintiff also said, that

2

the treble damage remedy under the Robinson-Patman Act was

3

ineffective.

4

would be normal, or all that would be necessary in the

5

absence of extraordinary circumstances would be to prove the

6

substantial price differential, and that would be damage, and

7

the amount of that damage would be that differential.
In that finding, and it's more than

8
9

This Court said, no, because all that there

mere dictum

I know that Chrysler characterized it as dictum -- but this

10

court had to analyze how you would prove price discrimination,

1 1

how you would prove damage under the Act that would be an

12

effective remedy.

13

Chrysler ignores, and what the 5th Circuit ignores, and that

14

is that the defendant in a price discrimination case would

15

always have the chance of rebutting the inference of injury.

16

It's not an automatic injury rule, despite their characteriza­

17

tion of it; it gives rise to an inference of injury.

18

And it recognized that, it recognized what

The factfinder should be allowed to determine

19

whether in fact there was injury or not.

20

evidence is introduced by the defendant showing that these

21

"extraordinary circumstances" exist in the marketplace, then

22

price discrimination, whether it be substantial or sustained,

23

is not going to give rise to the damage.

QUESTION:

15

other dealers who were competing in that very same time frame

16

under that very same program for the sale to the very same

customers in that market, and that put Payne at a total dis­

18

advantage in sales.

policy behind enforcing the antitrust laws.
QUESTION:

9

And therefore, to require proof of an

In Bruce's Juices, on page 746 the Court

10

is discussing the refusal to outlaw these discounts flatly,

11

and it says, at the top of the page, "They become illegal

12

only under certain conditions and when they are illegal it is

13

as much a violation to accept or receive as to allow them.

14

Bruce, in one of the years included in its balance of

15

account, purchased more than a half-million dollars of cans

16

on which it received precisely the kind and amount of dis­

17

count that now it asserts to be illegal."

18

Isn't that to a certain extent true of your client?

19

MR. REEVES:

To a certain extent it's true that

20

Chrysler's rebates lessened'the price, the Ultimate price of

21

the car

22

disadvantage, because our client had a higher cost on those

23

very same cars than the favored dealers.

24

you may be getting at is whether or not the fact that there

25

was a benefit to my client, does that countervail away against

to my client. But it didn't, it put our client at a

13

I think that what

1

the fact that there was a larger benefit to his competitor?

2

And I submit that the answer is an unqualified no; it doesn’t

3

matter that Payne received a benefit, because ultimately

4

the other people, the competing dealers, received a less-

5

priced automobile and were able to take away either sales

6

either profits, or either use more customer-attracting ser-^

7

vices and get the business and let Payne

Well, counsel, suppose before a discrimi­

11

nation takes place, two competitors are each selling 500

cars a year and then the manufacturer lowers the price to

13

one of the dealers but not to the other.

14

are both selling 500 cars a year, and the only thing that's

15

happened is that the disfavored dealer is not making the

16

same profit as his competitor,

17

he hasn't lost any sales.

Yes, Mr. Justice White, it is.
Well, is that an injury to competition?
It's an injury to competition; yes,

it is.

24

injury to competition but then just say, the injury to com­

your client?
MR. REEVES:

opinion correctly, stated that the proof of price discrimina­

4

tion by itself does not prove competitive injury, nor does

5

it prove -QUESTION:

6

It began Its opinion by saying that it

7

didn't need to decide whether or not there had been a viola­

8

tion of the Robinson-Patman Act.
MR. REEVES:

9

QUESTION:

10

That's correct.
And if there had been a violation of It

11

-- but I guess it proceeded to assume that there had been one,

12

and if there had been one, then there was an injury to com­

13

MR. REEVES:

15

QUESTION:

16

17

It did not -So if necessarily said that even if

there was a violation there was not causation.
MR. REEVES:

That's -- right.

They never addressed

18

whether or not under the elements of Section 2(a) of the

19

Act were met.

20

injury, according to it, was proved, because no lost profits

21

and no lost sales were shown.

22

QUESTION:

But it simply went off on the fact that no

Well, if -- why didn't you just take

23

the -- if you really are prepared to support your answer to

24

my question of a while ago, I suppose you would say that

25

whether your client lost sales in this case or not, he paid
15

1

more for his cars, and therefore he lost some profits.

2

MR. REEVES:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. REEVES:

5

Absolutely.
That's all you have to say.
I think that the 5th Circuit recog­

nized that.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. REEVES:

Well, but they didn't.

They said that --

Well, they distinguished paying more

8

for cars and lost profits.

They distinguished that by saying

9

under the enterprise doctrine that just means that my client

10

was not as well off as the more favored dealers.

It did not

11

-- this is their rationale, this is the 5th Circuit rationale

12

-- that it didn't damage Payne because he had to pay a higher

13

price, it merely made the other competitors in a better posi­

14

tion.

15

crimination on its head, as it were, because the evil that

16

price discrimination is designed to remedy is the difference,

17

the lower cost, to the favored dealer.

Well, that's turning the whole theory of price dis­

It doesn't matter whether you say it's an overcharge:

18
19

or an undercharge, it's still an injury in the form of even­

20

QUESTION:

Well, my example to you, though, the

22

500-car example, the disfavored dealer is making the same

profit, after the discrimination.

profit his competitor is.

25

MR. REEVES:

He just isn't making the

Can you say he lost profits?

Yes, you can, Mr. Justice White.
16

1

That ignores the economic reality of the marketplace in that

2

had the disfavored dealer received a lower cost, it might

3

have and could have theoretically in a competitive market

4

reduced its sales price, retail sales price, maximized its

5

volume, keeping the same profit margin, and thereby, since it

6

had more volume and more profit -- more volume times the

7

same profit margin, it lost profits.

8

theory of our economic system.

9

QUESTION:

And that is the whole

The fact is, though, that after the

10

discrimination, in my example, the favored dealer didn't

11

pick up any sales.

12

MR. REEVES:

Well, the favored dealer may not have

13

wanted to pick up sales.

14

I believe that's what your hypothetical envisioned.

15

therefore it could have done a lot of things.

16

cut back on its advertising, it could have pocketed the addi­

17

tional profit, it could have done a lot of things.

18

end result is that because the favored dealer has a lower

19

cost the economic opportunities, the position in the market

20

of the disfavored purchaser is injured.

21

It could have kept its same price.
And

It could have

But the

That's what this Court said in Morton Salt.

And it

22

used the words, "There is an obvious inference of damage" to a

23

merchant that pays a higher price for the same product than

24

its competing merchants and the competing seller.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Reeves, is there any evidence in
17

1

this record of injury to competition other than the injury

2

to your client?
MR. REEVES:

3

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe

4

I mentioned just briefly that the economist testified that

5

the price discrimination resulted in a two-pronged effect.

6

Number one, it made my client less able to compete, less able

7

to have as much profit.

8

retail sales price to the ultimate consumer in the market.

9

Therefore you have two types of injuries to competition.

Secondly, it raised slightly the

cient use of resources to get the lowest price to the ultimate

12

consumer.

whole was raised by reason of the discrimination?

of that type of. rebate program.

QUESTION:

I see.

Mr. Forman, you may

We will resume there at

the Court:
The issue in this case is what must a private plain­

17

tiff prove in order to be entitled to recover treble

18

for an alleged violation of Section 2(a) of the Robinson-

19

Patman Act?

20

damages

The 5th Circuit in its holding in applying the

21

teachings of this Court in the Brunswick decision held

22

that more than a mere threat of anti-competitive injury had

23

to be shown to entitle recovery of treble damages.

24

that the plaintiff had to go further and show that it had in

the sales incentive programs, and provide some useful measure

2

of the amount of such injury.
The court analyzed what the Robinson-Patman Act was

3
4

designed, or the injury it was designed to prevent, and held

5

that in order to prove a case of damages the petitioner, or

6

the plaintiff, had to show that competitive use was made of

7

a price advantage by a favored competitor, and that as a

8

result of this competitive use competition was injured by

profits being drawn, or sales being drawn from the injured

this case on the assumption there was a violation of the Act?
MR. FORMAN:

that, well, he really had to go further.

QUESTION:

5

Well, what about in my example of the

two dealers with each selling 500 cars?

Suppose I vary that.

7

Each of them is selling 500 cars before a discrimination takes

8

place.

9

disfavored dealer, keeps the price the same to the favored

And then the manufacturer raises the price to the

10

dealer, and afterwards they both sell exactly the same number

1 1

of cars; the only thing is, the disfavored dealer isn't mak­

12

ing the same unit profit, net profit, that he was before.

13

Is; that proof of injury to his business?

14

MR. FORMAN:

Not necessarily, if it didn't affect

15

the competition, it if was no -- it seems to me there may

16

not have been competition in that hypothetical, but I say,

if you --

afterwards, but the disfavored dealer isn't making -- he's

22

just lost profits, that's all.

23

I certainly will put that in, in it.

MR. FORMAN:

But the only

24

structure of the Robinson-Patman Act, there probably would

25

not be a violation.

I think the Act is not designed to -23

QUESTION:

MR. FORMAN:

8

favored dealer is disrupted because of a payment of a lower

9

price.

10

I think the Act is only there to remedy a situa­

But some competitive use has to be made by the

favored dealer.
QUESTION:

11

But if his -- the lowering of his profits

12

certainly makes him less effective, threatens his effective­

13

ness as a competitor?

14

MR. FORMAN:

It may threaten his effectivness, but

15

until something actually happens I don't believe he has a

16

cause of action.

17

go ahead and prove that it did threaten his ability to com­

18

pete.

19

paying more, it may have inhibited his ability because he

20

couldn't lower his price and thereby draw more sales, and

21

so forth.

22

this case that Mr. Payne would have lowered his price, there's

23

no proof of what would have happened if he had lowered the

24

price of his cars, whether he would have attracted new sales.

25

There's no evidence as to what profit he may have realized

Plus, I think in this case he would have to

I know Mr. Reeves used the example that, well, if he's

That's purely hypothetical.

24

There's no proof in

1

if he had done that.

2

that he did suffer any antitrust injury.

3

QUESTION:

There's simply no proof in this case

Therefore, in answer to my brother White's

4

question, your answer would be that in his hypothetical case

5

there wouldn't be a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act,

6

because there would not be injury to competition, since each

7

dealer continued to sell the same number of cars as he had

8

in :the past.

9

MR. FORMAN:

10
11

QUESTION: Therefore, you wouldn't get to the next
step of whether or not the plaintiff had shown injury?

12

MR. FORMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

I think that's correct, sir.

To himself.
Because there wouldn't be a violation of

the Act.

15

MR. FORMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

that the two dealers handled

18

General Motors cars, and General Motors and Chrysler agreed

19

to charge a higher price to one than the other.

20

that, and they nevertheless continued to sell 500 cars

21

apiece.

22
23
24
25

Correct.
Let me ask you, Mr. Forman, supposing
both the Chrysler cars and also

And they did

Would there be any violation of law?
MR. FORMAN:

I think then you've got a price-fixing

conspiracy.

Would you have any injury to either one of them?

MR. FORMAN:

MR. FORMAN:

how does it differ in

I think the difference is in the

design of the two acts.

In the overcharge cases it's always

14

good example, in this case, when Mr. Payne and the other

dealers in the Birmingham area purchased their cars, they

were paying the same price, there'd be no violation or alleged

17

violation of the Robinson-Patman Act.

18

a car is later sold' under one of these sales incentive pro­

19

grams can there even be any arguable price discrimination.

20

Now, if there had been no incentive programs the fellow would

not have been paying a lower price, Mr. Payne would not have

22

been paying a lower price for his cars.

23

He's paying more than he would have if there had been
If there was no conspiracy he would have

If there hac

26

Instead of charging

1

initially a higher price followed by rebate, you might start

2

out with a lower net price in the first instance to avoid the

3

violation.

4

MR. FORMAN:

5

QUESTION:

So if Chrysler had lowered the -I suppose instead of initially charging

6

$5,000 and later rebating $500, you might initially just

7

charge $4,500.

8

of having a rebate program, I suppose that the disfavored

9

purchaser would have been better off.

That would be -- and if you did that, instead

MR. FORMAN:

10

Well, he'd have been a little bit

11

better off, but I think the key in the Section 2(a) case is

12

how much worse off you are because somebody else received a

13

lower price than you did.

purely to look at the benefits to one dealer, it probably

would have been worded differently.

QUESTION:

And In the first case there would not be

In the second

case there would be, because you'd have a conspiracy to fix

prices, which is a violation of the Sherman Act.

case there might be proof of injury.

the plaintiff, is there really a difference, a meaningful

difference between the two cases?
MR. FORMAN:

4

I think there is in terms of antitrust

5

injury, which is the injury that is defined in Brunswick

6

that flows from the anticompetitive effects of the violation.

7

And I think you could perhaps look at the reasoning behind

8

the enactment of Robinson-Patman, and what was Congress try­

9

ing to do?

And I think the answer is, they were trying to

10

prevent an underselling.

What they were concerned about was

11

the growth of the chain stores at the expense of the

12

independent retailer-

13

ability to undersell the independent retailer and draw sales

14

from the independent retailer or draw profits if the fellow

15

tried to compete, match that competition.

They were concerned about their

But there you're not concerned with treble damages.

recovering substantial amounts of damage.

you've got to prove that you were in fact damaged.

MR. FORMAN:

I would submit that you probably do.

You should have some evidence there to corroborate what he

says .
QUESTION:

3
4

You need corroboration in some rare kinds of cases but -MR. FORMAN:-

5

6

Well, why do you need corroboration?

Because if you don't, I don’t think

you have any protection for the defendant.
QUESTION:

7

Well, the court could say, I just don’t be

But are you going to say, well, we believe you,

but you need some corroboration, or what?

Pardon me?
Well, what if the court believes him,

12

that he did lose sales?

MR.

FORMAN:

Could they give judgment?
I don’t see how.

14

this case, of what that damage was; unless he shows some

15

lost sales or some measure of it.
QUESTION:

16

Well, he says, I lost sales in the amount

17

of $80,000, out of which I could have have made $80,000 in

18

profit.

Is that enough?
MR.

19

FORMAN:

He said, I would have made $80,000 in

20

profit?

I would hope he could substantiate that by some

21

records

22

Otherwise the plaintiff could say anything.

I think that’s the only protection a defendant has.

QUESTION:

23

Well, If the judge were to say to him, I

24

believe you all right, but you have to prove it with some

25

papers?

Is that what you suggest?
32

I think that's right.

I think you

have to prove it with some evidence, some statistical evi­

3

dence .

QUESTION:

5

MR. FORMAN:

Well, why isn't his testimony evidence?
It isn't evidence because there is

6

not enough there to protect a defendant.

anything he wants to say, and unless -- where you're attempt­

us, Your Honor.

He allowed that document into evidence which

11

is one of our, another grounds on appeal in this case.

But it says to me basically that if Mr. Payne can merely say

undersold by his competitors, that he lost sales, that he

ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. LEE REEVES, ESQ.,

7

9

Mr. Reeves.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL
QUESTION:
the outset?

Mr. Reeves, may I ask you a question at

In the summary of your argument, the first

10

sentence states, "The plaintiff in a private price discrimi­

11

nation action must only prove sufficient price discrimination

12

from which a jury can infer injury to competition."

13

And in the Court of Appeals, the opinion, as I

14

read it, proceeded on the theory that you were arguing and

15

relying on the automatic damage concept.

16

your position on that?

17

MR. REEVES:

Have you changed

I don't think so, Mr. Justice Powell.

18

We contend that injury to a business is in fact injury to

19

competition.

20

out of the market, if one is less able to compete, or for

21

whatever reason, then that in itself weakens competition and

22

is injury to competition as well under Section 2(a) of the

23

Act, as well as the injury under Section 4 of the Clayton Act

24
25

If you have less competitors, if one is put

QUESTION:

So that if you prove discrimination,

you're entitled to damages?
46

MR. REEVES:

1

If you prove discrimination that is

2

sufficient to show or allow a jury to reach the inference of

3

injury, yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

4

this is not a per se, this is not an automatic, it's got to

5

be sufficient discrimination to permit the reasonable in­

6

ference.

7

Morton Salt.

9
10

That's exactly what this Court was holding in

QUESTION:

8

Not just -- for instance

Well, are you saying that even if this

owner hadn't got on the stand and said he lost sales or
profits, that you should win?
MR. REEVES:

1 1

I am.

I'm saying it both ways.

There

12

is adequate evidence, statistical evidence of tight profits,

13

testimony of lost sales, testimony that people came into the

14

shop and were shopping competition saying that they couldn't

15

buy at Payne because it was high, or wouldn't buy at Payne.
QUESTION:

16
17

Would you defend the 9th Circuit's

view of the Robinson-Patman Act?
MR. REEVES:

18

I do, and the 8th Circuit's, and the

19

7th Circuit's, in Bargain Car Wash, Mr. Justice White, as

20

not permitting -- or not saying automatic damage, because

21

it is, there's always the possibility of rebuttal by the

22

defendant if the extraordinary circumstances this Court

talked about in Bruce's Juices are present.

there is such an inelastic market that it really doesn't

1

What do you do with the congressional

2

history, where they had a presumptive damage provision and

3

they eliminated it during the course of enacting the

Robinson-Patman Act?

5

That is the presumption -- the pre­

6

sumptive damage rule was in the Senate's version of the

7

bill.

8

9

And I say to Your Honors that if

10

originally in there, without finding out the real reason

11

behind why it was eliminated, then you totally disregard

12

the purpose of the Act.

13
14

15

QUESTION:

Well, then you say there is a presump­

tion of damage?
MR. REEVES:

I say that this Court should reaffirm

16

the minimum damage rule that it indicated in Bruce's Juices

17

and in Morton Salt which permits an inference of damage, at

18

least in that amount, subject to rebuttal, and that the mere

19

fact that there was at one point a provision of presumptive

20

damages does not mean that that, the elimination of it by

21

Congress meant that Congress didn't want that type rule, be­

22
23

cause that rule was redundant.
It was always extant under
)
the Clayton Act, Section 4 of the Clayton Act, as is pointed

24

out in our original brief and reply brief; I think the

25

Ladoga decision permitted it.
