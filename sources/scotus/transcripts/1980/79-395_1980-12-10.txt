ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. BUSCEMI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case presents the question of whether it is

10

proper to dismiss a criminal indictment as a sanction for mis­

11

conduct by government agents that did not affect the pending

12

criminal prosecution.

13

to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

14

The facts and simple and essentially undisputed.

15

The case is here on writ of certiorari

In April 1977, Respondent sold approximately one

16

ounce of heroin to a government informant.

17

was indicted for that offense and for another similar sale

18

that she allegedly made to the same person in May of '77.

19

two-count indictment was returned in the District Court for the

20

Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

21

indicted, Respondent retained her present attorney.

22

continued to represent her throughout these proceedings.

the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Respondent's case.

They visited her in order to request her

cooperation in their own separate investigation of a major
heroin dealer in the Philadelphia area -QUESTION:

This was a substantial time after she had

been formally charged, wasn't it?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, the indict­

ment was returned on June 28, I believe, 1978.
QUESTION:

And the visit was --

10

MR. BUSCEMI:

1 1

QUESTION:

12

MR. BUSCEMI:

And the visit was August, 1978.

And was her trial date set by that time?
I think the trial date was set for

13

about -- around the middle of September.

14

Respondent that she faced a lengthy jail sentence on the charges

15

against her and that if she cooperated, they would make that

16

fact known to the U.S. Attorney.

17

that by cooperating, she would improve her chances for a favor­

18

able sentence.

21

whether she was represented by a public defender.

The agents told

They apparently represented

They also advised her of the Witness Protection

QUESTION:

Agent Hopson inquired

Does the record show whether the United

States Attorney was aware of these visits?
MR. BUSCEMI:

I think the record shows that the United

States Attorney was not aware of these visits, Mr. Chief

4

1

Justice.

2

the Assistant United States Attorney responsible for the case

3

before the indictment was ever returned, but there's nothing

4

in the record to suggest that the Assistant U.S. Attorney knew

5

that the agents were going to visit Respondent.

There was a contact between Respondent's attorney and

QUESTION:

6

Didn't the agents also tell her that this

7

judge before whom she was scheduled to be tried was notoriously

8

tough,

or -MR. BUSCEMI:

9

The Respondent testified at the hearing

10

that the agents did refer to the District judge as a tough

1 1

sentencer.

12

whether he had made any soecific comments about the judge

13

personally, but that he certainly had told her that she faced

14

a severe sentence.

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

The agent himself said that he couldn’t remember

With respect to any of these discrepancies in the
testimony, Mr. Justice Stewart, there is a footnote right at
the beginning of the Court of Appeals' opinion, in which the
Court says that it decided the case on the basis of the undis­
puted facts, in addition to any other facts in the record
considered most favorably to the government, because the
District Court had made no factual finding.

So the Court of

Appeals would dismiss the indictment even before factual infer­
ences, if you want, for the government.
Respondent told Agent Hopson the name of her attorney
and Hopson asked her how much she paid him.

She said $200.

1

2
3
4

Ke asked her whether she'd ever seen the attorney's work, and
he said that he had seen it in the past and that she should
think about the kind of representation she should get for
$200.

And he advised her that if she was interested in cooper­

5

ating, she should seek the assistance of a public defender.

6

Now Respondent gave the agents no information.

7

8

QUESTION:

Well, if he was right on his premise,

then he was sound on his conclusion, I suppose.

9

MR. BUSCEMI:

I suppose so, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

Respondent in any event, didn't say anything to the agents

11

and they left; they left a phone number where they could be

12

reached.

13

house and at his instruction and in his presence she called

14

Agent Hopson and said she'd like to arrange a meeting for the

IS

next day.

16

returned several hours later and the Respondent was home by

17

herself, or she said she had company and therefore couldn't

18

speak with them at the time.

19

later to set up an appointment for the following day.

2C

and it's not clear from the record whether another agreement

21

was made to meet, but in any event the agents returned for the

She immediately called her attorney, he went to her

They set a time and the agents returned, but they

Agent Hopson promised to call
He did,

third time on August 25th, '78, and had essentially the same
conversation with Resnondent that they had had two days before.
Again, Respondent didn't give them any information, she told
them that she only wished to speak with them in the presence
6

1

of her attorney and the agents left, saying that any future
2

discussions would be in the U.S. Attorney's office, with
3

Respondent's attorney present.
4

Now a few days after that, right at the beginning of
5

September,

'78, Respondent entered into a conditional plea

agreement with the government.

QUESTION:

In the reproduction of Judge Hunter's

opinion for the Court of Appeals, on page -- 2A of the certior­
ari opinion, this is described as saying, "immediately after
the announcement of the District Court's decision denying the
motion, Morrison entered an opinion-conditional plea of guilty
to one count of distribution, what does that mean?

MR. BUSCEMI:

She entered a conditional plea of guilty?
That's right.

Thank you.

MR. BUSCEMI: In any event, Respondent's plea was
conditioned on her right to appeal the denial of her motion to
dismiss the indictment in the event the. District Court denied
7

1

that motion.
2

QUESTION:

Is there any statutory authority or

3

authority under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for
4

a conditional plea of guilty?
5

MR BUSCEMI:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the

6

Courts of Appeals are divided on that question.

Some circuits

7

permit these conditional pleas and some circuits do not.

The --

QUESTION:

Do they regard it as a matter that they

can decipher themselves apart from the statutes or the Federal

Rules of Criminal Procedure?

--- Mr. Justice Stewart just referred
discuss the matter at some length and

I don't think that -- they don't find any authority in the
criminal rules for this procedure, but they point out that the
appeal is from the final judgment and the sentence that is
entered by the District Court and they point -- they analogize
that situation to this Court's decision in the United States
v. Haines, and Lefkowitz v. Newsome, they acknowledge that

22

it's not exactly the same because there's no constitutional

23

infirmity with the charge against the defendant.

24

not a matter of --

25

QUESTION:

I mean, it's

Well, Lefkowitz v. Newsome too, was a case

7

that originally came up through the New York courts -MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Right.

-- where the New York Court had allowed

this sort of plea.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, well the federal case that the

Court of Appeals relies on is United States against Haines.
In any event, I'd like to inform the Court that there is

8

currently pending a revision of Rule 11 that would permit

9

conditional pleas.

The current version of that rule would

10

require the consent of both the defendant and the government

1 1

and it has been endorsed, I believe, by both the ABA and the

12

reporter for the criminal rule.

13
14

IS

QUESTION:

Let's assume there's a plea of guilty

that isn't conditional. Is it appealable?
MR. BUSCEMI: Well I would think that if this plea of

16

guilty was not conditioned, this -- denial of this motion would

17

not be appealable, no.

18
19

QUESTION:
appealable?

Why?

I mean, why isn't the plea of guilty

The judgment is entered on the plea.

20

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well ordinarily --

21

QUESTION:

Well,

22

MR. BUSCEMI:

Ordinarily, Mr. Justice White, the

why isn't it appealable?

23

rule is that the plea of guilty waives any other objections to

24

the admissibility of evidence --

25

QUESTION:

Well what about the McCarthy case, the
9

1

2
3

original case on Rule 11, wasn't that a direct appeal?

Where

you challenge the procedure of the arraignment.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, well I think that that's just

4

another example of the general proposition that there are some

5

matters that remain open for appeal, even after a guilty plea.

6

I'm not sure that an evidentiary matter would be one of those,

7

this kind of situation perhaps falls somewhere in between the

8

constitutionality of the statute on which the person has been

9

convicted or just the matter of suppression of evidence.

10

In any event, that was the procedure that was adopted

11

and the District Court thereafter conducted a hearing on Respon

12

dent's motion to dismiss and then he denied it, the District

13

judge denied it without rendering any opinion.

14

pled guilty to Count I, and at the Rule 11 proceeding that

was held, she admitted selling heroin to the government infor­

any way, or

whether her criminal -prosecution had been affected by the
agents' visits.

Nevertheless, the Court held that the indict­

ment should be dismissed because of what the Court called the
10

1

2
3

agents' deliberate attempt to destroy the attorney-client
relationship.

And to subvert the defendant's right to the

assistance of counsel.

4

Now apparently, because Respondent's conviction had

5

not been affected by the agents' conduct, the Court concluded

6

that this dismissal was the only sanction available that would

7

remedy the alleged constitutional violation.

8

vanced two alternative arguments that the Court of Appeals

9

decision is incorrect.

But we've ad­

They are parallel in many respects.

10

First, we've argued that the DBA agents' actions did not vio­

1 1

late Respondent's right to counsel because her criminal pro­

12

secution was not affected, and some discernible prejudice is

13

an essential element with a Sixth Amendment violation.

14

we’ve said that even if the agents' conduct did infringe

15

Respondent's constitutional right, dismissal of the indictment

16

is not an appropriate remedy here because the violation caused

17

Respondent no injury.

18

QUESTION:

Second,

Does the government disagree with Judge

19

Garth's statement dissenting -- granting en banc consideration

20

at page 21(a) where he says "the panel's analysis reduces to the

21

following non sequitur since the DEA agents' conduct was
reprehensible, the defendant must be granted some relief and
since there was no disclosure to suppress or trial to retry, a
dismissal is proper."?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that's
11

1

the essence of the government's second argument, that regard­

2

less of whether or not this conduct is thought to violate

3

Respondent's Sixth Amendment rights in some abstract sense,

4

to dismiss

5

prejudice whatsoever, is to essentially reverse all the rules

6

of relief and remedy that have been developed through the years,

7

because the more effective --- I mean, the more drastic relief

8

is given in the case where the harm is the least serious, in

9

fact, non-existent.

10

the indictment in this case where there's been no

Before we even get to that point, however, the

1 1

government's position is that the Respondent's Sixth Amendment

12

rights weren't violated at all.

13

that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the

14

right to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.

15

Resondent had the assistance of counsel for her defense at all

16

stages of the prosecution.

17

counsel's assistance was in any way impaired and therefore the

18

literal command of the amendment seems to have been satisfied.

19

The Sixth Amendment provides

She doesn't suggest that her

The Court of Appeals' error was that it focused on

20

the impropriety of the agents' conduct, rather than on the

21

effect of the conduct on Respondent.

22
23
24

25

And that's not to say

that these attempts by the government's agents to 'interfere
with the attorney-client relationship should be condoned; it.
is only to say that the attempt in and of itself is not enough
to violate the right to counsel.

The Sixth Aunendment comprises
12

1

a number of these procedural guarantees to ensure fairness of
2

criminal prosecutions.

If a government agents' attempt to deny

3

a defendant

of

those guarantees fails, the defendant's right

4

is fully exercised, the fairness of the proceeding is not
5

affected and no constitutional violation has occurred.
6

QUESTION:

Well suppose, suppose someone to whom this

7

happened wants some kind of vindication and brings a civil

14

IS

19

suit, claiming that the agent violated his or her constitutional
right to counsel and he wants a declaratory judgment to that
effect and a penny.

He just wants the people to know that they

shouldn't do that sort of thing.

And your submission is that

unless she can show some interference at the trial that there's
just been no violation whatsoever?

That's your first argument,

that there is no violation of the right to counsel, so the case
would be dismissed on a motion for failure to state a cause of
action.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, assuming that there was no pre­

judice alleged -QUESTION:

That's all she says.

She just says these

20

things happened and she says, "P.S. there was no intereference

21

with a fair trial."

22

MR. BUSCEMI:

That's right, Mr. Justice White.

The

23

burden of this first argument is that no constitutional viola­

24

tion has occurred.

25

it's just to say that the constitutional rights haven't been

Again, that's not to say that this was right,

13

1

violated.
2

QUESTION:

Or you say

it was constitutional for

3

them to do what they did?
4

MR. BUSCEMI:
5

6

I wouldn't put it that way.

8

12

QUESTION:

Can we rule on the remedy point without

Or we could say whether or not it vio­

certainly could say that whether or not this violated the Sixth

Well, that's saying the same thing.

MR. BUSCEMI:

13

14

that it was improper

QUESTION:

the Sixth Amendment point?

10

11

I would say

but it didn't violate the Constitution.

7

9

Well, that's an affirmative statement;

Well that's essentially what the Court--

Even though it didn't violate any pro­

vision of the Constitution.
MR. BUSCEMI:

That's what the Court of Appeals' panel

said, -- the Court of Appeals' panel said that the Constitution
had been violated.

Now if the Constitution hasn't been vio­

lated, and no statute has been violated, we've run into the kind
of problem that's raised in a case like Jacobs, for example,
14

1

where we're trying to decide what the power of the federal

2

courts is, to dismiss criminal charges in the absence of any

3

constitutional or statutory violation.

4

as the case comes to this Court that situation is not presentee

5

here .
QUESTION:

6

And that's -- at least,

Well this action on the part of the Third

7

Circuit has to be justified under supervisory power, doesn't

8

it?
MR. BUSCEMI:

9

10

Well, I don't believe so, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

11

Well, I'm not saying it is justified,

12

it must be justified in order to have it stand.

13

isn't that your position?
MR. BUSCEMI:

14

That's --

Well, it depends on how you use the

15

phrase supervisory power.

but the Court neverthe­

Well, isn't supervisory power basically

the power that any Appellate Court has in formulating a body
of law and deciding cases that it reviews from lower courts?
15

1

MR. BUSCEMI:

I think that's probably a good way to

2

look at it, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because it really is no
3

different than the general decisionmaking power that the
4

Court has to decide the case or controversy before it.
5

6

supervisory power, seems to me to be little different in many
ways from the common law development of cases.

QUESTION:

Are they a little different from the ordi­

nary power of a reviewing court to correct an unconstitutional
error?
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart --

I never

thought there was any magic in

the phrase supervisory.
MR. BUSCEMI:

I agree that there's no magic in that

14

word, the question of whether the supervisory power should be

15

used to dismiss indictments when --

MR.BUSCEMI:

QUESTION:

But they have it by virtue of the right

given by Congress to any litigant who loses in the District

Court to appeal to the Court of Appeals, and to anyone who loses

5

not?

I mean --

6

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well that's right.

I mean, there's

7

no question that the Court's supervisory power is dependent

8

upon the acquiescence of Congress.

recognized that in the absence of any -- if Congress decides

10

to change this Court's supervisory power in some way, it can

I mean that point was discussed at some length in our

QUESTION:

13

I mean, this Court has

So what you're really saying is that

14

there's no constitutional violation as long as all -- that

15

this was just an attempt?
MR.BUSCEMI:

16

That's the burden of the first argument,

17

is there's an attempt to violate the Constitution but it didn't

18

succeed and so there's no violation.
QUESTION:

19

Now --

And that even if there is -- even if it's

20

a violation, you say the remedy is just excessive, and I suppose

21

you say, even though there's no other remedy?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, I would, although in this case, I

-- I mean, as we informed the Court in our reply brief, there
has been civil recovery of a substantial nature, but in any
event -17

1

2

QUESTION:

I suppose that the fact of

violation

would be not open to relitigation, in a civil suit?

3

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, I don't see how there could be

4

a civil suit, because as part of the terms of the settlement

5

there's been a waiver of all future claims against the govern­

6

ment or its agents as a result of the conduct that's involved

7

in this case.
Now, I think I'd like to turn to the government's

8
9

second argument.

The only other point that I thought I'd make

10

on the first argument, to refer the Court to Massiah, which

11

I think is instructive because of the way in which the Court

12

decided the case focusing on the use of the evidence at trial

13

rather than the way in which the evidence was obtained.

14

recommend -- I commend that part of Massiah to the Court's

15

attention, I think we quoted from it at some length in the

16

brief.

I

17

Now on the second point, to pick up where Mr. Justice

18

Rehnquist left off in his question earlier, it seems to us that

19

this remedy is thoroughly disproportionate to what actually

20
21

happened in this case.

As Judge Garth observed in his dissent,

the panel's decision effectively puts Respondent in a better
position because she wasn't prejudiced by the agents' conduct
than she would have been in if she had suffered some harm.
Because in that event, the existing more common remedies would
have relieved her of any unfairness in the criminal prosecution;
18

1

evidence that had been obtained could have been suppressed,
2

or a new trial could have been ordered, if her trial had been
3

tainted, but in this case, since she suffered no prejudice she
4

winds up better off

and

the charges against her are com­

5

pletely dismissed.
6

Even in Gideon, where there was no attorney at all,
7

at any time, in the prosecution, the remedy was a new trial
8

with an attorney, not dismissal of the indictment.

And I

9

think that, as we say in our brief, it would be inconceivable
10

for this Court to hold that a Fourth Amendment violation that
11

resulted in no -- in the acquisition of no evidence, should
12

result in a dismissal of the indictment for that reason, rather
13
14

15
16

17
18
19

than the suppression of any evidence that might have been
found.
Even in, in the Fifth Amendment context, in United
States against Blue, where there allegedly was some evidence
obtained in violation of the

privilege against compulsory

self-incrimination, the Court specifically said that dismissal
of the indictment was too drastic a remedy; the only remedy

20

to which the defendant would have been entitled was suppression

21

of that evidence.

22

Now, I think that in this respect the Court of

23

Appeals'main error is that it assumed that whatever remedy

24

there could be had to be a remedy in this criminal proceeding.

25

This criminal proceeding involves events that occurred 16
19

1

months earlier, that had nothing to do with this agent's visit.

2

The agent's visit was wrong, but it didn't affect that pro­

3

ceeding and there's no reason to think that any relief awarded

4

has to be awarded in the pending criminal proceeding.

5

6
7

QUESTION: ’ There has been a civil recovery, I think
there's a reference to that -MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, there's been -- the reply brief

8

describes the civil recovery at the very beginning, I think,

9

on pages 1 and 2.

10
1 1

12

13

Respondent received, I believe, $4500, 25%

of which was to be paid to -- was designated for attorneys fees.
QUESTION:

Did the attorney get something in additior

to that, or was that -MR. BUSCEMI:

The attorney in the criminal case filed

14

an independent lawsuit against the DEA agents, charging them

IS

with defamation in the course of their conversation with

16

Respondent and he did recover $2,000, again, 25% of that to be

17

paid to his attorney in the civil suit.

18
19

Now, I'd like to conclude by addressing myself for
a moment to the Court of Appeals'

asserted

need for

20

prophylactic action in this area.

21

said before that this was not proper conduct and no one for

22
23
24

25

I want to emphasize as I've

the government has ever asserted that it is proper conduct,
it's also not the law enforcement policy of the DEA or any
other federal agency.

And I'd like to refer the Court in that

connection to the letter from Deputy Attorney General that
20

1

we've printed in the Appendix to the brief, which discusses
2

the general problem of agents contacts with represented defen­
3

dants in the absence of their attorney.

And it states unequiv­

4

ocally that the government's general rule is that there should
5

be no such contact without the consent of the attorney.
6

There are some peculiar situations that may arise
7

that might necessitate such a contact, and they are discussed
8

in some detail in that letter.

But the general rule is that

9

there should be no such contact.
10

QUESTION:

The $4500 settlement in the civil suit

1 1

has some tendency, does it, do you think, to suggest that the
12

13
14

15
16
17

18

19

Court of Appeals was wrong saying that there was no other
remedy available for the misconduct of the agents?
MR.

BUSCEMI:

Well that's certainly true as to the

second prong of our argument, Mr. Chief Justice.

Of course, if

this Court rules in accordance with the first part of our
argument that there was no constitutional violation here, there
would be nothing to remedy, and the unavailability of another
procedure would not be a problem.

But at least if there was a

20

violation I think that this civil recovery is very significant,

21

with respect to the availability of an alternative remedy.

22

Finally, even if -- we've cited some Court of Appeals

23

cases in our brief that generally support the government's

24

position here, but leave open

25

of an indictment may be permissible if the Court finds itself

the possibility that dismissal

21

1

-- as a last resort, unable otherwise to change a longstanding
2
3
4

5

6

repeated pattern of government misconduct, even if that is
correct, there is no allegation or evidence of any such
pattern of government misconduct in this case and we think that
that's an inappropriate basis on which to affirm the Court of
Appeals' dismissal.

7

8

I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for
rebuttal, if the Court has no further questions.

Of course not, Your Honor.

What was the $4500 for?

CUCINOTTA:

The $4500 is -- was a settlement,

Your Honor, but how can that pay for selling the adversary
system or avoiding the adversary system?

Does that not allow

the government to make purchases for heroin and then use a
little more money to pay the individual for the attempt of
avoiding the adversary system, all they're going to do is ask .f4>r
more funds to do away with trials.

QUESTION:

No ,

If they are allowed to pay

you are in a situation that is

Well, I thought the Court of Appeals

would refer you to the remedy for this person, not a broad-

17

scale remedy for society?

18

MR.

19

QUESTION:

20
21

CUCINOTTA:

Well --

So the $4500 was the remedy for what the

Court of Appeals thought that no remedy existed.
MR. CUCINOTTA:

Mr.

Chief Justice,

I thought that

22

the remedy as far as the system was concerned, and as far as

23

Hazel was concerned, was the dismissal of the prosecution and

24

also, together with that dismissal, it was an additional remedy.

25

It was not an either/or, because if it becomes .aneither/or then

23

1

we have the -- a mockery of justice, to a very large extent.

2

As I said, you will allow the government to make these attempts

never know who represents which side.

I don't agree with that as the

I don't agree with that as the

Those are not the facts.

She was only told she could

get a public defender after she cooperated with the government.
So she really was asking for her attorney to be pr'esent, and
she was told by the government agents that it was only them and
not her attorney or any attorney who could help them get throug n
that S.O.B. in federal court who hates black people.
24

It was

the government agents and not through her right to counsel,

2

and when she asked for her right to counsel, she was told that

3

she would face a harsher jail sentence and she stood with five

years as the first conviction.

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Mr. Cucinotta, if I might interrupt you

for a moment, certainly the adversary system of which you -which you champion is important, albeit -- but it's a part of t|he
administration of the system of criminal justice, and your
client had been indicted by a grand jury for possession of
29

drugs and certainly society has an interest in seeing that
she is punished as prescribed by Congress if proof can be
produced in the normal way, and under standards prescribed
by the Constitution and the statutes.
MR. CUCINOTTA:

Society has a greater interest in

protecting their own right to counsel.
QUESTION:

Well, society -- it's not just one right

as opposed to nothing on the other side, it's the system of
how the laws shall be enforced in this country.

And as

certainly society, as a whole, if it's going to be governed
by the majority of the people and by the legislative branch,
has

an interest in seeing conduct that is proscribed as

penal by the legislative branch, punished as prescribed by the
legislative branch so long as the Constitution is not vio­
lated, does it not?
MR. CUCINOTTA:

Yes, I agree with the Court.

And

I’m -QUESTION:

I’m not the Court, I'm only one ninth of it.

MR. CUCINOTTA:

I would respectfully suggest to

Justice Rehnquist that the interest of each of one us is what
the lower court and all the judges down there were seeking to
protect.

They weren't really interested in the fact that my

client pled guilty or did it, or didn't do it.

That wasn't

really as important as the fact that you have to protect so­
ciety's interest to make sure that this activity doesn't occur
30

1

again.

To say that a civil remedy that has been argued in

2

briefs by the government, would be some sort of alternative
3

relief, I wish it would be that easy.

Because I'm asking for

4

some real drastic relief.

But it's not really that easy,

5

because civil remedies lead -- first of all, they allow it to
6

occur, they say -- set forth, as I said earlier, you can pay
7

it, pay it, and then the next question is well how much money

do we think Hazel Morrison's rights were infringed upon mone­

MR. CUCINOTTA:

MR. CUCINOTTA:

Oh yes, they are.

Do you know what's in them, or not?
Peripherally, I am sure that there

any further than that, Mr. Justice.

Yes, and I -- urge the Court to find

that whether they were settled, whether the right exists and
31

1

whether it doesn't exist, does not treat the problem here.

2

It's merely an extra form of relief.

3

If I felt in any way that exchanging certain amounts

4

of money would be selling out the adversary system, I'd feel

5

sort of like Judas, giving up Christ.

6

would be all over.

7

tell the Court that in the release, there's a statement that

8

says that this release has nothing to do with the criminal case

civil case.

MR. CUCINOTTA:

Oh yes, yes.

the civil suit.

QUESTION:

That doesn't quite bind us, does it?

MR. CUCINOTTA:

Nothing binds the Court, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Okay.

Thank you.

QUESTION:

You know, the reference to the civil

litigation brings to mind other situations which are not ones
32

1

the bar is terribly proud of, but there are occasions when

2

claim adjusters, for example, go to a plaintiff in a personal

3

injury suit without telling counsel and make the same kind of

slanderous remarks about counsel.

12

sions with my colleagues in the civil bar.

Maybe by analogy what you should do is

enter judgment against the insurance company in those cases?
MR. CUCINOTTA:

You can get into all sorts of specu­

17

lations.

18

if Hazel went to Steve Hopson and said if you don’t get a new

19

prosecutor who is a little more easy on me, then you are not

20

going to see your kids anymore.

21

I want to raise with the Court is that when you see this kind

22

of activity in a record, that it's up to the government to

23
24

25

I sometimes speculate about how, what would happen

So, -- but one of the points

show whether or not the prejudice has been harmful or not.
It's not up to me to go around and say we've been prejudiced
because of Fact (a), (b) or (c), with all that discussion
33

1

regarding motions to suppress, illegal evidence, tainted
2

evidence, the fact that a new trial here would not be the apprc
3

priate remedy because that would particularly allow the

4

situation to go on, to give you two bites out of the apple.
5

8
9

10

11

12

A civil remedy doesn't help it.

There's only one remedy, and

that is dismissing the prosecution.
QUESTION:
government?

Well why do you say the burden is on the

Certainly on a motion to suppress, the burden is

on the party desiring suppression.
MR. CUCINOTTA:

Well, when you file a motion to

suppress, if the burden is on the government to show that the
evidence has been constitutionally gleaned, whatever it may

13

be, whether it be the statement or it would be the fruits of

14

the evidence.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR.CUCINOTTA:

I thought the law was the other way?
No, it's not the burden on the

17

defendant, or the defense counsel, to show that the item has

18

been unconstitutionally acquired.

19

Justice, it is when you have situations such as this, which

20

are really violations of due process, you don't want to get

21

involved in what I call nice calculations as to the extent of

22

the denial, of the right to counsel.

23

suddenly turn around and say well, it hasn't been denied for

24

this, this and this reason.

25

QUESTION:

But be that as it may, Mr.

It's up to them, to

Well, they haven't said that.

Well, whatever burden -- whoever has got
34

two things:

have carried it, because the Court concluded that there wasn't

14

any prejudice.
MR. CUCINOTTA:

15

If the Court please, I suggest in

16

terms of the motion to dismiss the indictment, the Respondent

17

did carry the burden, he did prove his case.
QUESTION:

18

Since you put this so heavily in your

19

argument, on exposition and defense of the adversary system,

20

what if this Court had said the next five drug cases are all

21

to be dismissed as a result of this misconduct of the govern­

22

ment?

23
24

25

Would that be an excessive remedy?
MR. CUCINOTTA:

I think that really comes to the next

part of my argument, Mr. Justice.

And that is, I wouldn't go

along with that sort of opinion.

I would respectfully ask the
35

1

Court to decide that it'stime to dismiss them now, and not wait
2

-- and to a certain extent, look at what the government is

only difference between what happened here and what happens
when we have these regulations, is that we allow a U.S.

Hopson went to my client and he wasn't interested in the
adversary system, he raced through his mind, he had a jury, a
trial, litigated, all the process went right through his head,
and he decided that he was going directly to my client.

And

indeed, they told my client and said, we'll give you a dis­
missal or we'll give you -- we'll really be harsh against

you.

Under your argument, wouldn't -- in
