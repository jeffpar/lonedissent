CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

next in Steadman v.

Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mr. Mickies, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. MICKLES, ESQ.,

5

OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6
MR.

7
8

We will hear argument

MICKLES:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue presented in this case is whether the

9
10

Securities and Exchange Commission should be required to apply

11

a clear and convincing standard of proof, rather than a pre­

12

ponderance of evidence standard,

13

ings alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the

14

Securities statutes.
The Petitioner, Mr.

15

in its disciplinary proceed­

Charles Steadman,

is the presi­

16

dent,

17

voting stock of Steadman Security Corporation.

18

is registered with the SEC as investment advisor, advisors and

19

managements, a number of mutual funds called the Steadman

20

Funds.

21

chairman of the board and sole beneficial owner of the
That company

More than 10 years ago, the SEC commenced a pro­

22

ceeding against Mr.

Steadman and SSC, and over the objections

23

of the Petitioner, it applied a preponderance of the evidence

24

standard, defined violations of the anti-fraud provisions

25

of the Securities statutes.

On the basis of those violations

3

1

the SEC imposed the most extreme sanctions at its disposal.

2

Those sanctions would bar Mr. Steadman from association with

3

any investment advisor.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

But the case was sent back for recon­

sideration of the sanctions, wasn't it?
MR. NICKLES:

The case was sent back on remand becaus e

7

of the problem the Fifth Circuit had with the articulation of

8

reasons for the extreme sanctions.

9

Mr. Justice Blackmun, the sanctions related not only

10

to a bar on association with an investment advisor, they went

11

on to bar Mr. Steadman from association or affiliation with a

12

registered investment company, would suspend,

13

association with a broker-dealer for one year.

14

QUESTION’:

him from any

Mr. Nickles , assume for a moment that the

15

sanction had merely been a reprimand, a very mild sanction.

16

Would you argue that the same clear and convincing standard

17

would be required?

18

MR. NICKLES:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Yes, Your Honor.

So that the severity of the sanction

is really totally irrelevant to our consideration of the case?
MR. NICKLES:

It is not irrelevant, because one

22

gets into gradations of relevant factors dictating what stan­

23

dard of proof should be applied, and it will be our argument

24

that when one has in this case, a combination of important

25

factors such as the extreme sanctions and such as the
4

1

allegations of fraud, that that is a much easier case for

2

this Court to impose a clear and convincing standard of

3

proof.
QUESTION:

4

What your argument really is, I guess,

5

Mr. Nickles, that in view of the fact that a sanction of this

6

severity is potentially imposable, then a clear and convincing

7

standard is necessary before offending

8

assumed.

9

MR. NICKLES:

the statutes can be

That's correct, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION: Because --

11

MR. NICKLES:

12

QUESTION:

And we have that exact --

-- the sanction, for one thing, as my

13

brother Blackmun said, has been remanded, and for another thing

14

just in logic, the -- your argument would be the same, whether

15

the sanction actually imposed had been this one or some less

16

severe one.

17

a sanction of this severity can be imposed?

But it is a relevant part of your argument that

18

MR. NICKLES:

19

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

Certainly one of the reasons, as I have

20

understood it, that in a criminal case the proof must be

21

beyond a reasonable doubt, is the fact that the sanction upon

22

conviction can be loss of personal liberty and confinement in

23

an institution, and in some extreme cases, death.

24
25

MR. NICKLES:

That's correct, Your Honor.

If one

does not stand with that proposition, one gets into the
5

1

problem the D.C. Circuit was confronted with, after it issued

2

its decision in Collins v. SEC, in which it said we want a

3

clear and convincing standard of proof, and the SEC the next

4

time around, in a case involving Whitney, said well, in this

5

case we're only imposing a nine-month suspension on a broker-

6

dealer, and so in< this case, since the sanction is less than

7

we imposed in Collins, we'll apply a preponderance of the

8

evidence standard.
QUESTION:

9
10

But that isn't quite consistent with

your initial answer to Mr. Justice Stevens.

11

MR. NICKLES:

12

QUESTION:

13

You said it would-

I don't --

-- make no difference to you, to your

case, if there had been simply a reprimand.
MR. NICKLES:

14

I believe, Your Honor, that the

15

authorization to impose extreme sanctions is the triggering

16

device to impose a higher standard of proof, but I am also

17

saying the fact that the SEC imposed extreme sanctions is

18

relevant in this context for the Court to understand the

19

nature of the damage to reputation and profession that can be

20

imposed by the SEC, on the basis of the lowest standard of

21

proof known to the judicial system, preponderance of evidence

22

standard.

23

I might also add that the net effect of the order of

24

the SEC that was recognized by the SEC, is to force a sale

25

by Mr. Steadman of his multi-million dollar enterprise,
6

1

Steadman Security Corporation, in effect a distress sale,

2

and the SEC provided a 90-day period in which to sell the

3

assets.

4

sale of the assets.

So you have not only a bar, but you have a distress

Now when the case went up on appeal to the Fifth

5

6
7

Circuit -QUESTION:

Mr. Nickles, I take it you feel that the

8

-- in this case and on the facts of this case, a different

9

standard would have led to a different result?

10

MR. NICKLES:

Absolutely.

Your Honor, and the reason

11

we say that, and I'll get into that in more detail, when the

12

case went up to the Fifth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit said

13

there's no question that but under Section 17(a)(1) of the

14

1933 Act, scienter'is required, and they said the SEC made a

15

finding of intent to deceive.

16

findings of the SEC to

17

is the mere existence of the fact that Steadman and SSC had

18

loans outstanding to certain banks of national reputation that

19

held the custodianship of these funds.

20

puzzled and said, why didn't the SEC make a finding that Mr.

21

Steadman or SSC had intentionally offered the custodianship

22

of these funds to the bank in exchange for the loans?

23

interestingly, they dropped a footnote, which relates to

24

another point, and the footnote said the reason presumably why

25

the SEC did not make those findings is because all of the

But what do we have in the

sustain that finding?

7

All we have

And the Fifth Circuit

And

1

2
3
4

evidence was to the contrary.

All of the bank officials that

were put on the stand, testified that in every case the loans
were made solely on the basis of the borrower's ability to
repay at normal competitive interest rates and that there was

5

in fact, no connection, no connection between the loans and

6

the custodianships.

7

What matters is that there is a potential for'conflict of

8

interest.

9
0

But the SEC said, that doesn't matter.

What matters is that Mr. Steadman potentially might

keep excess amounts of the Fund's assets in non-interest bear­
ing checking accounts and what matters is that he did not

11

disclose that potential conflict of interest over a period

12

of years.

But I observe to the Court that at no time did the

3

SEC even charge Mr. Steadman with keeping excess amounts of

4

funds in non-interest bearing checking accounts and indeed,

5

there was no finding and indeed, the finding was to the effect

that the funds benefitted to a tune of several hundreds

So there was no benefit, as such, to Mr. Steadman,

there was no harm to the funds, and on that basis, the Fifth

Circuit said, we see little basis for a finding of intentional

misconduct.

We have second the allegations of fraud.

And we have third the very substantial, institutional and
procedural advantages that are accorded the SEC in its admini­
strative proceedings.
Let me start with that last item -QUESTION:

Mr. Nickles, before you get into the

MR. NICKLES:

Are you making a statutory argument?
Not exactly, Your Honor.

We are saying

That's right.

standard of proof?
Just as in the --

23

the denaturalization cases, the expatriation cases, we're

24

saying, as in Woodby, the Court has the power, this is a tra­

25

ditional power of the judiciary, to fashion a standard of
10

1

proof to administer federal statutes and litigation under

2

federal statutes.
QUESTION:

3

Now the government relies rather, toward

4

the end of their brief, on the language of the Administrative

5

Procedures Act?

6

MR. NICKLES:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, on Section 7(c)

And do you contend that that language

8

should be construed to impose a clear and convincing burden,

9

or that that language has nothing to do with the burden of

11
12

13

proof?
MR. NICKLES:

We contend it has nothing to do with

this case, and this Court held in the Woodby case that
language --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. NICKLES:

That was a different statute.
It's the Immigration and Nationality

16

Act, Your Honor.

17

Court said, that that language means to us scope of review and

18

quality of evidence, and if the Court reviews

19

lative history, it will find that at least its stated very

20

clearly in the Attorney General's Report which was primarily

21

relied on in the APA development, that one was talking about,

22

in Section 7(c), scope of review and quality of evidence, not

23

burden of proof.

25

But essentially the same language and this

12

Your Honor, what we have

here, and if I might analogize to the Aaron kind of case that

the Court had, you have substantive provisions that are

3

alleged to be in violation, in this case 17(a) of the '33

Act, 10(b) of the '34 Act, 206(1) and (2) of the Investment

Advisors Act.

6

provisions, in effect, enabling provisions or enforcement

7

provisions pursuant to which the SEC commences the disciplinary

8

proceedings.

9

And then you have, on top of the substantive

And what you have is a double layered analysis.

Under 9(b) of the Investment Company Act and 203(e)

10

and (f) of the Advisors Act, there is a requirement that

11

prior to the imposition of a remedy,

12

sanction upon a respondent found to have violated a provision

13

of the Securities law, the SEC must find that that violation

14

was willful and that it is in the public interest to impose

15

such a sanction.

16

the argument not only that under common law it's clear that

17

in fraud cases you impose a clear and convincing evidence.

18

But under this Court's holding in Aaron, and with the statu­

19

tory provisions in question here, you have a requirement that

20

scienter be found; that is, intentional misconduct.

21

that is, any kind of

QUESTION:

This is, undoubtedly, my own ignorance

and no one else's fault, but what is the statutory language

23

or statutory citation that enables you to appeal at all, or

24

petition for review at all, from a finding of the SEC to the

25

Court of Appeals?
13

1

MR. NICKLES:

I don't, I don't have the specific

2

U.S. Code annotation for the Court, but there's a standard

provision permitting us to appeal to the Court of Appeals,

as to -- why Congress didn't say anything about what standard

SEC, since the NLRB standard is substantial records supported

18

by substantial evidence supported by the record and

agency actions.

So you're satisfied that the Fifth

MR. NICKLES:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Let me start with the --

One other question, while we've got you

interrupted, Mr. Mickles.

It is true that Section 706 of the

Administrative Procedures Act dealing with scope of review,
does contain the normal provision that the lack of substantial
evidence shall be grounds for reversal on the facts?
MR. NICKLES:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And are you saying that's a substantial

duplication of what's found in Section 556 -MR. NICKLES:
Your Honor.

We're not saying that necessarily,

I think --

QUESTION:

What is the difference in the function

of 556(d), the language the government relies on, and the
language in 706 defining scope of review?
MR. NICKLES:

706 is clear and simple

a scope of

18

review provision.

I believe that 7(c) goes not only to the

19

question of how the Court of Appeals reviews the findings

20

below, but to the quality of the evidence.

21

while the SEC admits all kinds of evidence, hearsay, double­

22

hearsay and all the rest, these items of evidence would not

23

ordinarily be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

24

The Court of Appeals would be entitled to insure itself that

25

the SEC has relied upon probative evidence, substantial,
15

To be specific,

1

2
3

reliable and probative evidence, as distinguished from hearsay
and other kinds of evidence which is not probative, in reaching
its findings.
It goes, I think, as much to the question, Your

4
5

Honor, of admissibility --

QUESTION:

7

and substantial" --

But the phrase is "reliable, probative

8

MR. NICKLES:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes.

And substantial is surely not a test of

admissibility.
MR. NICKLES:

11

Your Honor, I think while the choice of

12

words may not be as fortunate as we would hope, both in the

13

Woodby case and in the Attorney General's Report, which

14

is a key feature of the legislative history of the APA, it's

15

indicated that's precisely what the Congress had in mind in

16

using those terms.
Let me talk for a moment about the institutional

17
18

and procedural advantages of the SEC -QUESTION:

19

Well, let me ask you, where do you think

20

this standard applies that you're looking for, before the SEC,

21

isn't it?

22

MR. NICKLES:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. NICKLES:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

It's not on review.
No.

It's just whether it's from the -- what
16

1

Standard the administrative agency should use?

2

MR. MICKLES:

Admissibility, yes.

3

The SEC's principal argument, really, is that

4

the standard of proof is designed to allocate the potential

5

for error in a fact finding proceeding.

6

talking about probabilities in any kind of fact finding pro­

7

ceedings, the SEC says that we should use a preponderance of

8

the evidence standard because that leaves everything about

9

equal to both sides.

10

One is inevitably

And in that way we produce the most

correct decisions.
Now that may be true of when we're dealing in a

11

12

civil or criminal trial under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

13

But I submit to this Court that the evidence at the end of an

14

SEC proceeding is Very different than the evidence would be

15

at an identical proceeding if that proceeding were held in a

16

civil trial or a criminal trial before federal and state

17

courts.

18

Let me tell the Court why.
The SEC has immense investigative powers, pretrial.

19

The Respondent has none.

A Respondent has no rights, in SEC

20

proceedings, to depositions, no rights to -- access to the

21

voluminous ex parte material that is developed by the SEC,

22

during its investigation, no right to a list of prospective

23

witnesses to be called by the SEC, no right to obtain exculpa­

24

tory materials from the SEC until a witness testifies and after

25

he testifies, and then beyond that, the admission of all kinds
17

1

of evidence that would not be admissible under the Federal

2

Rules of Evidence.

3

The SEC

is

investigator, it is prosecutor, it is

4

judge, it is jury.

This Court knows the SEC, quite commendable,

5

has sought to broaden the scope of its statutes.

6

cases, particularly when the SEC has gotten into the area of

7

anti-fraud violations, this Court has seen fit to limit the

8

SEC's interpretation.

9

these types of cases, where the individual is not accorded the

But in some

And we submit that it's particularly in

10

rights that an individual is accorded in civil or criminal

11

trials in a courtroom, that clear and convincing is required.

12

And we say also that because of the allegations of fraud,

13

clear and convincing is required.

14

We have findings of violation in this case of 17(a),

15

of 10(b) of 206(1).

Each of which, under the holdings of this

16

Court, require a finding of intentional misconduct, and the

17

two enforcement provisions, 9(b) of the Investment Company Act

18

and 203(e) and (f) of the Advisors Act require a showing of

19

willful violation.

rights are at stake, to impose a higher standard of proof.

And you make no constitutional claims?
Absolutely.

But Addington was recent,

Mr. Justice Stewart, Addington reviewed the types, the three

MR. NICKLES:

No.

No, we have a situation, Mr.

Justice Stevens, here, where we have an individual being

You can get both of those things in a

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH C. FERRARA, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. FERRARA:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

0

Mr. Ferrara.

The Securities and Exchange Commission agrees with
the Petitioner when he asks, or when he says, that this Court

11

should mandate a standard of proof more stringent than the

12

preponderance, and that his only basis for doing that is that

3

the Court should exercise policy considerations to support its

decision.

5

stitutional question involved in this case and there is no

6

statute whatsoever that the Petitioner can point to, and say

7

that it serves as a basis for his argument that the clear and

8

convincing standard should apply to commission proceedings.

9
20
21

For, as' he correctly points out, there is no con­

QUESTION:

Is there any basis for him to suggest

a supervisory power of the Court over the regulatory agency?
MR. FERRARA:

There is, Mr. Chief Justice, and the

22

Court has exercised its supervisory powers in other cases,

23

particularly the cases that the Petitioner has cited to the

24

Court in the course of his argument.

25

deferred in exercising its supervisory powers , when there has
20

But the Court also has

1

been a statute.

And we have learned, through many cases that

2

this Court has taught that the place to begin analyzing a

3

securities case is with the language of, the statute itself.
QUESTION:

4

But this Court doesn't have the super­

5

visory authority over agency proceedings

6

lower federal courts, does it?
MR. FERRARA:

7

that it does over

It does not, Your Honor, but I believe

8

what Mr. Nickles was referring to, was the Court's supervisory

9

procedures to establish standards of proof in lower court

10

proceedings and perhaps by analogy, to agency proceedings.

11

the Court has only --

QUESTION:

That's the question.

That's what my

13

question was directed at.

14

Justice Rehnquist .'

15

over regulatory agencies that we do over district courts and

16

courts of appeal?

17

But

And it apparently concerns Mr.

Do we have the kind of supervisory power

MR. FERRARA.:

Once you eliminate the constitutional

18

question and take, as a given, that there's a statute that

19

governs the situation, then the Court in the past has said

20

it would not exercise any supervisory power that it might have.

21

The Court said, in Vance v. Terrazas, for example, when the

22

Congress legislated a specific standard of proof to be

23

employed in that case, the Court would defer, absent any con­

24

stitutional considerations which it said was not involved in

25

that case.

In our case, as I said a moment ago, we have a
21

1

statute whose specific language prescribes a preponderance of

2

the evidence standard of proof, that specific statutory language

3

is supported by relevant legislative history and the varying

4

interpretations of that language and that history have to be

5

looked at in order to determine whether or not the interpre­

6

tation that we believe is the correct one supports the under­

7

lying statutory scheme.

8

Commission, .time and time again, is the proper mode of analysis;

9

for securities cases.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

That's what this Court has told the

What do

you say about the relevance of

the Addington holding here?
MR. FERRARA:

Well, we believe that the Court never

13

need reach Addington.

14

and we never have to reach the question of whether the Court

15

need balance --

16

the interest of Mr. Steadman in determining what the correct

17

standard of proof is.

18

The APA governs here, it clearly governs;

balance the interest of the public against

Here, the APA governs.

It's undisputable that -- let me back up for a

19

moment in response to a question that Mr. Justice Rehnquist

20

asked of the Petitioner.

21

provide a scope of review provision; Section 25(a) of the

22

Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is typical and it provides

23

that any person who is aggrieved by an order of the Commission

24

may appeal that order to the Court of Appeals.

25

goes on to provide that the Commission's findings of fact

3

governs.

4

Commission adjudicatory proceedings unless the Federal Secur­

5

ities laws displace it in some respect.

6

Federal Securities legislation though, is such that the APA

7

substantially governs these proceedings including Section

8

7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.

9

As we know,

Beyond that, the APA

the APA clearly covers all aspects of

The scheme of the

That section specifically provides that no sanction

may be imposed except in accordance with reliable, probative

11

and substantial evidence.

the language mean?

13

became the Administrative Procedure Act, and that inserted

14

the critical language to that Section 7(c), the words

15

accordance with" and "substantial", explicitly characterized

16

those words in 7(c) as a standard of proof to be applied in

17

administrative adjudicatory proceedings.

18

It says it very clearly.

What does

The House Report, underlying the bill that

"in

Mr. Justice Clark, who at the time of the passage

19

of the Administrative Procedure Act, was attorney general,

20

in his dissenting opinion in the Woodby case, noted that

21

language in the Immigration and Nationality Act which was

22

similar to the APA should be construed as the APA language

23

had always been construed.

24

"reliable, probative and substantial" is a standard of proof.

25

The majority in Woodby did not agree with that.

And that is that the language

23

Curiously,

1

the D.C. Court of Appeals, the very court that has decided

2

the Collins and Woodby cases, and the Sea Island case, which

3

was a case involving the Federal Communication Commission,

4

where the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals applied a clear and

5

convincing standard, it

6

7(c) set a preponderance standard of the proof and then

7

completely ignored the language and went on to apply the clear

8

and convincing standard.

9

too recognized that the language in

Well, that's why we believe the

words of Section

10

7(c) and the appropriate legislative history supporting those

11

words, confirm that the preponderance of the evidence standard

12

is supported.

13

QUESTION:

Could I ask you what is the -- is the

14

board that did the adjudication in Woodby, was that an

15

administrative agency?

16

MR. FERRARA:

to the Administrative Procedure Act.

MR. FERRARA:

21

22

It was not an agency that was subject

Expressly?
That's correct.

As a matter --

And that's why Section 7(c) was irrelevant

in that case?
MR. FERRARA:

That's correct.

Mr. Justice Clark

23

had argued in his dissent that the words that had been put intc

24

the Immigration and Nationality Act were similar to the words

25

in 7(c), and that 7(c) had historically been interpreted as
24

1

requiring no more than preponderance.

Now --

Scope of review.

-- related to review in the -- not

to adjudication?
MR. FERRARA:

That's correct.

That, Mr. Justice

8

White, is the critical difference between this case and Woodby

9

In Woodby, the words "reliable, probative and substantial"

10

were added to the Immigration and Nationality Act, in order

11

to provide a scope of review provision for the courts.

12

not included in the Administrative Procedure Act for that

13

purpose at all.

14

quite separately, for a scope of review section; that's Sec­

15

tion 706 or Section 10(e) of the Act.

16

I guess, to the --

17

It was

The Administrative Procedure Act provides

QUESTION:

And that brings you,

Well, what did, apparently there was no

18

statutory guide then for the standard of proof, before the

19

administrative agency in Woodby?

20

MR. FERRARA:

In Woodby, that's absolutely correct.

21

But as I said a moment ago, that's what distinguishes this

22

case so dramatically from Woodby.

23

prior teachings of this Court in analyzing securities cases.

24

What does the SEC's interpretation do to the underlying statu­

25

tory scheme of the APA?

Again, I draw from the

25

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. FERRARA:

3

QUESTION:

4

But the APA wasn't passed until 1946
That's correct.

-- and the SEC Acts in question were

passed in the '30's.

5

MR. FERRARA:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So, what was the standard -- rather, what

7

was the standard of proof before the SEC, between the time the

8

SEC Acts were passed and the APA was passed?
MR. FERRARA:

9
10

evidence

The scope of review was substantial

for facts.

11

QUESTION:

Standard of proof.

12

MR. FERRARA:

Standard of proof.

Standard of proof, was historically

13

always preponderance of the evidence standard.

14

had always utilized that standard of proof.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FERRARA:

The Commission

Even in a fraud case?
Even in a fraud case.

Had always used

17

it, and since 1967, the Commission's opinions have articulated

18

its standard of proof rationale in terms of the Woodby case.

19

QUESTION:

And even if, in -- I suppose you could

20

argue the Administrative Procedure Act would govern, regardless

21

of what the standard was before it was passed?

22

MR. FERRARA:

Absolutely.

Because the provisions,

23

the standard of proof and the scope of review provisions of

24

the Administrative Procedure Act apply to all administrative

25

adjudications by the SEC, unless another law applies.
26

And the

1

SEC law, the Federal Securities Laws do not apply, then the

2

APA's application is pervasive and absolute.

3

Again, I think you have to look at the APA very

4

carefully to distinguish it from the situation that we had in

5

Woodby.

6

ately, for burden of proof which it places on the agency,

7

quality of evidence that is, the admissibility of evidence,

8

it proscribes irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitive

9

evidence.

Note that the APA beautifully provides, quite separ­

It provides separately for standard of proof in

10

the words that I cited to you before, that is, reliable,

11

probative and substantial, and then provides, quite separately

12

again, for scope of review.

13

dence for factual findings, and arbitrary, capricious, and

14

other standards for predictive or quasi-legislative judgments.

15

It talks about substantial evi­

Now the Commission's position is that even if this

16

Court disagreed, that the APA didn't by its language, its

17

words, apply to this proceeding, then nonetheless, the Court

18

should defer to the Commission's judgment to apply a standard

19

of proof no greater than preponderance in this case.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask one other question about the

21

statutory language in the APA?

22

construed other than by an agency, to require nothing more

23

than a preponderance of the evidence?

24
25

MR. FERRARA:

Has that language ever

been

Yes, as a matter of fact, it has.

And it's been construed by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
27

1

In the Sea Island case, remarkably, the D.C. Circuit Court

2

of Appeals looked at the language in Section 7(c) and said

3

that it traditionally has been found to require no more than

4

a preponderance and in the very next -QUESTION:

5

6

That's a strange way to describe prepon­

derance, in all candor.

7

MR. FERRARA:

8

QUESTION:

9

I'm sorry?
If

the Congress had meant pre­

ponderance, I don't know why they just didn't say that.
MR. FERRARA:

10

Well there's, I think, a reason for

11

that.

12

the words "substantial" and "in accordance with" were added

13

to Section 7(c), there's a note to the House Report that I

14

recall, that says something to the effect that the additional

15

words "substantial" and "in accordance with" were added

16

for the same reasons that words were added in the preceding

17

footnote.

18

and you see that what Congress was about in both this part of

19

7(c) and in the part of 7(c) referred to by the prior note,

20

was conforming the language as best it could, rationalizing

21

the language as best it could, between the standard of proof

22

and scope of review provisions of the APA, so that courts

23

wouldn't be confused with respect to standards of proof and

24

scope of review.

25

The reason is that when you look at the words, when

5

6

based on the entire record of the proceeding to the agency

The standard

So that Congress added the words

10

should rely on the entire record

11

for the appellate function, agencies might run amuck and not

12

specify it on the entire record.

13

because it did specify it

By similar reasoning, what the Court did when it

14

reached the standard of proof section was to say we'd like to

15

use the same words, the same notions, in the standard of proof

16

section that we used in the scope of review section.

17

Congress done what you suggested, Mr. Justice Stevens, and

18

that is, say the word preponderance in the standard of proof

19

section, what that would have created in the Congress' mind,

20

and this is what they said their problem was in doing that,

21

is that ambiguity between the standard of proof and scope of

22

review section, the standard of proof section would have said

23

agencies are to decide by a preponderance.

24

section would have said, courts are to review on the basis of

25

substantial evidence.

Had the

The scope of review

And what I think the Congress was

1

2
3

7

8
9

worried about, although now I'm getting away from what the
actual words of the legislative report say,

is that

appellate courts would have drawn on the preponderance
standard that they would have specifically included in the
scope of review provision and made it a scope -- I'm sorry,
the standard of proof provision, and made it a scope of review
provision.

And the Congress didn't want that; they wanted

substantial evidence to be the exclusive test for judicial
review.
Now that's a rather complex answer, but unfortunately

10

11

what you're tearing at are the tissues of legislative history

12

to understand why Congress very carefully and -- in this very

13

carefully honed act -- chose the words that it chose to express

14

the meaning that.it intended to convey in sorting through these

15

various provisions, that the -- I know the Petitioner, in his

16

reply brief, as I recall it, says that the Attorney General's

17

manual, the authoritative guide to the APA, doesn't character­

18

ize Section 7(c) as a standard of proof section, but rather

19

characterizes it as a scope of review section.

20

doesn't include in his reply brief is that the Attorney

21

General's manual was written before the bill was enacted.

22

And the critical language , the language about -- the addition

23

of the language of "in accordance with" and "substantial" was

24

not added until after the Attorney General's report

25

written.

But what he

was

And now we have Mr. Justice Clark's dissenting
30

1

opinion in Woodby where he actually, and I think correctly,

2

characterizes what the meaning of that language is.

QUESTION:

Of course, the Attorney General's manual

4

may be a little bit one-sided too.

But that -- that may very well be,

12

Justice Rehnquist.

13

silence of the Attorney General's manual on whether 7(c) is

14

a standard of proof provision is easily explained by the fact

15

that the provision didn't exist in its present form at the time

16

the Attorney General's manual was written.

17

a very small point.

18
19

20

But I think the relevant point is that the

I'm making there

We are not the ones relying on or discrediting the
Attorney General's manual for purposes of this proceeding.
The, as I said a moment ago, even if the -- even if

21

this Court determined that the APA specific language of 7(c)

22

was not applicable here and it did not prescribe a specific

23

standard of proof as we think that it did, we relieve that the

24

agency's discretion in utilizing the preponderance of the

25

evidence standard of proof should be respected.
31

Our position

1

there is that this Court, in the Vermont Yankee case, noted

that the Administrative Procedure Act admittedly in a rule-

vided the essentials.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. NICKLES, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

12
13

MR. NICKLES:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Justice Stevens asked whether there was any

14

authority for the proposition that the words in Section 7(c)

15

of the Administrative Procedure Act have been construed to

16

require a preponderance of the evidence.

17

If the Court will look at Sea Island, which is the case cited

18

by my brother, what the -- what the late Judge Leventhal

19

said in Sea Island at page 243 was that that was the tradi­

20

tional standard used in civil proceedings, no reference at

21

all to the APA, but that for reasons relating to sanction,

22

relating to allegations of fraud, it thought Collins should be

23

applied in that particular case.

25

QUESTION:

The answer is no.

The other point is that this

Mr. Justice Clark, in his dissenting
33

opinion in Woodby, spoke as though it was well established

2

that that language did establish a burden of proof within the

agency.

MR. NICKLES:

I don't think so, Mr. Justice Clark --

Mr. Justice Stewart.

MR. NICKLES:

It was.
-- and it was a footnote, without

further citation.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. NICKLES:

That's right.
The footnote said, this pattern,

12

pattern was to limit the agencies to acting on reliable,

13

probative and substantial evidence, as traditionally had been

14

held satisfied when the agency decided on the preponderance

15

of the evidence.

That was an argument specifically rejected

MR. NICKLES:

Well --- by the majority.

QUESTION:

There's no --

-- maybe he was mistaken, but the fact

4

that it was a dissenting opinion doesn't mean that he was

5

disagreeing with the Court as to that.
MR. NICKLES:

6

Mr. Justice Stewart, I don't think

7

there's any opinion of this Court or any other Court that has

8

held that a preponderance of the evidence standard is the

9

required standard when one is talking about reliable, proba­

10

tive and substantial evidence.
The majority in Woodby took the same language and

11
12

said that means to us quality of evidence.

13

our brief to the Attorney General's report and to the legis­

14

lative history, which we think makes it crystal clear that

15

Congress and the Attorney General were talking about quality

16

of the evidence.
