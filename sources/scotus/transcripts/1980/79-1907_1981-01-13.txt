ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

9
10

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This income tax case comes here on a writ of

1 1
12

certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the

13

Tenth Circuit.

14

well established formula method set out in the Regulations for

15

more than 40 years, for measuring the gross income from mining

16

of

17

manufactured product, the so-called integrated miner-manu­

18

facturer.

19

proportionate profits method is to determine the price at

20

which the taxpayer would have sold his mined ore to itself

21

in a hypothetical sale, so as to confine the depletion deduc­

22

tion to its intended purpose of compensating for the exhaustio

23

of the mineral deposit, the depletion deduction is a fixed

24

percentage of gross income from mining.

25

proportionate profits method is employed as it was in this

a

The questions involve

an application of a

taxpayer who mines and thereafter produces a finished,

The object of the formula which is called the

3

The method, the

1

case, where there is no representative field price or sales
2

of -- actual sales at the cutoff point, at the point in which
3

the mining activity ceases, or where there's -- essentially

4

at arm's length.
5

And the underlying theory of the propor­

tionate profits method, which is a cost-ratio method, which

6

is set out in our brief at page 3, it's a formula which
7

essentially multiplies a fraction, the

numerator of which

8

is

mining costs over total costs -- that is, mining plus

9

non-mining costs, times the gross sales of the first market­
10

able product which here is finished Portland cement and
1 1

that figure -12

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you right there,

13

that gross sales figure?

That is the actual -- that isn't a

14

constructed figure, is it?
15

MR. SMITH:

No, not at all.

16

QUESTION:

That is an actual figure representing

17

the sales price of the finished product, whatever that product
18

is ?
19

MR. SMITH:

Exactly, exactly.

20

QUESTION:

Of the first marketable product?

21

MR. SMITH:

Of the first marketable product.

22

QUESTION:

And so that if it, normally, that price

23

would be enough to cover all costs, anyway?
24

MR. SMITH:

Yes.

25

QUESTION:

Or they will go broke -4

1

MR. SMITH:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

4

QUESTION:

All right.

5

MR. SMITH:

Yes, exactly.
So It's the gross sales price?

And the theory of the -- the underlying

6

theory of the method is that each dollar of cost earns its

7

proportionate share of gross sales and thereby, of profits.

8

And the questions in this case are two, and they involve a --

9

they both involve detailed applications of the method.

10

The first question involves, is whether the gross

11

sales figure, that is, the multiplier of the first marketable

12

product includes bulk and bagged cement as the regulations

13

require, or whether, as Respondent contends, simply bulk

14

cement.

15

of the fraction, that is, the total cost and whether the --

16

whether that denominator should include costs of bags, bagging,

17

storage, distribution, and sales.should be included as the

18

regulations require.

19

20

And the second question involves the denominator

QUESTION: While the two questions are separate, they
are

interrelated, are they not?

21

MR. SMITH:

22

QUESTION:

23

Absolutely, absolutely.
And they have to kind of be answered the

same way?

24

MR. SMITH:

25

QUESTION:

Exactly, exactly.
Well, you couldn't lose the first
5

1

2
3

5

6
7

8

question and still not change the denominator, could you?
MR. SMITH:

No, no.

While the> [questions are inter­

related, I think the -QUESTION:

Well so if -- if your first marketable

product is bulk cement, you're certainly not going to include
in thd denominator the cost of bagging?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No, exactly.

The facts --

Let me ask one fact question, Mr. Smith.

9

MR. SMITH:
10
11

QUESTION:

Sure.
On his tax return, did the taxpayer,

with respect to sales costs and office administrative costs,

12

did the taxpayer seek to exclude them entirely or to place
13

some of them in the numerator?
14

MR. SMITH:
15

My understanding is that he sought to

exclude them entirely; that's basically the position that the

16

Court below, which as we set forth in our petition and in our
17

brief, is really -- has been out of line with not only the
18

regulations, but with all of the other Courts of Appeals.
19

QUESTION:

Does the taxpayer take a different

20

position on that than it did in the court below?
21

MR. SMITH:

I think so.

My understanding in looking

22

at the briefs now, is the taxpayer is seeking a prorated -23

QUESTION:

Yes.

24

MR. SMITH:

-- a prorated approach.

25

QUESTION:

agreed with you that the first marketable product was both
bulk and bagged cement, I'm not sure it would have excluded
any costs from the denominator.
MR. SMITH:

Well, it's hard to tell.

I mean, I

can't put myself -QUESTION:

Well I know, but it said that the first

marketable product was bulk cement -MR. SMITH:

Yes, yes, so it more or less then --

QUESTION:

-- in this event, you should throw out

some costs from the denominator.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, and I -So your first question, if you win

on

the first question, you win.
MR. SMITH:

I think if I win on the first question,

as a logical matter the second question is a subsidiary quesion which takes care of itself.

But it's hard to know exactly

how the court below felt about this question.

Generally,

because it had-- this question has been kicking around in
the Tenth Circuit ever since the Ideal Basic case.
QUESTION:

There's no suggestion that they would

throw those costs out of the denominator even if -MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No.
-- even if the first marketable product--

MR. SMITH: No, well what the Tenth Circuit has
said, which we take strong disagreement with, is that the

25

first marketable product was bulk cement.

So let me just

simply sketch out the facts which are relatively simple.
QUESTION:

Which do they sell most of, by the way?

MR. SMITH:

They sell mostly bulk cement, the

bagged cement accounts for about 7 or 8 percent of its -let me put it this way, the cement in bags, it's the same
product, it's whether it's sold in a railroad car, whether
it's packed in bags, pursuant to particular kind of customer
demand for cement in bags.
The facts are relatively simple.

This resporident,

like all others in the cement industry, is an integrated
miner-manufacturer of Portland cement.

The mining process

involves a quarrying and a digging of this cement rock, it's
a calcium carbonate kind of rock, it's reduced in size.

It's

then ground to a high degree of fineness, water is added,
to produce something called the slurry.

And then that slurry

is stored in tanks and agitated to maintain uniform mixture
until such time as it passes to the manufacturing process.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, is it agreed that the mining

phase stops at the point where slurry is -MR. SMITH:

Yes, I think that is -- that is agreed.

Because the mining process,

and Congress has, you know,

ratified this in Section 613(c)(4)(f) which was enacted in
response to the Court's Cannelton decision, the mining pro­
cess stops at the kiln

feed, everything after that is

non-mining.

And then this liquid slurry as I've averted

is then fed into these rotary kilns which are fired and a
hard substance called a clinker is ultimately formed, that
clinker is cooled, ground up with purchased gypsum, to produce
the finished cement.

And then there is a final grinding and

then the finished cement is stored in silos.
Some of the cement is sold in bulk in tankcars , or
piggyback, or gondola cars, a variety of different forms for
large consumers that need cement in that kind of quantity.
But the important thing is that cement has to be kept dry,
otherwise if it becomes wet it becomes worthless, so some
people don't need that much cement and for those customers
this manufacturer as well as all others in the integrated
industry, pack

the bag, pack

the cement in bags of --

which are a standard 94-pound weight as I understand it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, I suppose it never happens,

but suppose this manufacturer sold everything in bags, would
you have a different case?
MR. SMITH:

Then I would have a different case, but

I don't think there would be a quarrel, I mean, essentially
it would be the same marketable product; in our view, it
would still be cement, the bagging costs would be a cost of
sale and we would contend that that would be -- that would
have to go into the denominator and the bagging -QUESTION:

So the Commissioner;would take the same
9

1

position that he took --

2

MR. SMITH:

Right, but I assume that this taxpayer

3

couldn't really argue that anything else was a first marketabl e

4

product.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, it has nothing to do with

6

this case at all, but what's the difference between concrete

7

and cement?

25

MR. SMITH:

Concrete as I understand it -- and I

should know this because I'm a city boy, I think is what
happens when the cement is, you know, put in the building and
it hardens.

I think you talk about a concrete sidewalk, I

don't think you talk about a cement sidewalk.

But I could be

wrong on that.
Well, this taxpayer, the Respondent computed its
gross income from mining, in accordance with the proportionate
profits method; indeed, it had to, because as I said, there
is no representative field price, and it did not sell as -nor did anyone in this industry, sell kiln feed,

so there's

no way to know how much kiln feed would sell for.

But

contrary to the command of the regulations, and I have to
emphasize that these regulations which are set forth in
detail and are the appendix to our brief, are detailed and
more or less pre-empt this area, and pre-empt it in accordance
with a command of Congress in Section 611(a), that the Commis­
sioner promulgate such regulations, the Respondent computed
10

1

its gross income by excluding bagged cement from the compu­
2

tation, and by excluding the costs of bagging, storage, dis­
3

tribution, and sales from the total costs element in the
4

formula of the so-called denominator in that fraction.
5

The Tax Court in this case upheld the

Respondent

6

because the Tax Court has a rule in which it will follow the
7

relevant circuit to which a case will go, the so-called
8

Golsen rule.

And since this Court of Appeals had already

9

expressed itself, in the Ideal Basic

case, that's why the

10

Tax Court held the way it did

and the Court of Appeals

11

followed its Ideal Basic decision.
12

Now in our view with respect to the first question,
13

the Respondent's first marketable product is finished cement,
14

regardless of the form of packaging.

As I said, the theory

15

of the proportionate profits method is that each dollar of
16

cost produces the same percentage of profits .

To exclude

17

any costs or any element through any aspect of gross sales
18

received

in production or sale of the first marketable

19

product compromises the integrity of the formula.
20

QUESTION:

Well what about the companies that sell

21

on delivered price basis, and they pay for the transportation?
22

You don't include transportation?

You deduct transportation

23

costsfrom gross sales price, don't you?
24

MR. SMITH:

Only certain kinds of transportation,

25

11

1

Mr. Justice White.

The

2

QUESTION:

So long as you don't make a profit on

3

it?
4

MR. SMITH:

Well essentially, if they are delivered

5

over to a transporter, it's the transporter's profit.

That

6

is an accomodation that the regulations make with respect
7

to purchase -8

QUESTION:

So you do not include all elements of

9

gross sales?
10

Well that as I understand it is the only

MR. SMITH:
1 1

element of gross sales that is not included.
12

QUESTION:

Why isn't it included?

13

It's not included as I --

MR. SMITH.
14

QUESTION:

Because the company doesn't make a profit

15

on it?
16

Because the company -- basically,

MR. SMITH
17

because it's the transporter's profit.
18

QUESTION:

Well,

so yes, I'm right.

The company

19

itself doesn't make a profit on it?
20

The company does not make a profit on

MR. SMITH
21

transportation, but -22

QUESTION:

Well what if it didn't make any profit

23

on its ba:gging?
24

MR. SMITH

It -- well, I don't think we'd have to

25

worry about that in this case, because -12

1

QUESTION:

I know you don't want to worry about

2

it, but that's the very worry in the case.
3

MR. SMITH:

No, it's not the very worry --

4

Well then it's one of them.

QUESTION:
5

MR. SMITH:

Well no it isn't, Mr. Justice White.

6

And the reason it isn't, is because the Respondent -- because
7

it's been stipulated in this case that the Respondent realized
8

a net profit on the sale of each bag of cement and -9

That is not, it is not stipulated that

QUESTION:
10

his

he made a profit on

bagging expense?

11

On the bags.

QUESTION:
12

MR. SMITH:

Well, if you -- yes, yes --

13

QUESTION:

Is it?

14

MR. SMITH:

It is not sipulated that he made a

15

profit -16

As a matter of fact, the claim is that

QUESTION:
17

he loses; that it costs him more to bag than he adds to the
18

price from the bagging.
19

MR. SMITH:

Yes.

But the point of the proportion of

20

profits method is that it has to measure the sales of a
21

finished product.

And part of the -- and this Respondent,

22

as well as all other cement Integrated producers sold bagged
23

cement in response to a customer demand for cement in bags,
24

and there is no suggestion here that -- and it seems to me,
25

that the relevant fact is that this Respondent earned a
13

12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

profit on each bag of cement that it sold.

And once it is

assumed that that is a profitable aspect of its business,
all of that has to go into the equation -QUESTION: Except transportation because he doesn't
make a profit on it?
MR. SMITH:

Well except transportation, because

transportation basically is taken out of his hands and put
into the hands of the transporter and our

point

is with

respect to transportation that I know that the -QUESTION:

The point is that he doesn't make a

profit out of it.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly, exactly.

But he did make a

profit on the sale of bagged cement, and I think that makes,
all the difference in the world.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

I know you do.
The conditions of the regulation, the

purchase transportation regulations, are set forth at page
13(a) of our appendix to our brief, and you can see that the
conditions are very narrow.

It says which -- it's not trans­

portation conducted by the taxpayer, but which is performed
in conveyances owned or leased

by persons other than the

22

taxpayer rather than conveyances owned or leased by the tax­
23

payer, which are performed solely to deliver the taxpayer's
24

minerals and mineral products to the customer rather than to
25

transport such minerals or products from packaging or other
14

1

additional processing which are charged to the customers in
2

such a way that the taxpayer does not ordinarily earn any
3

profit with respect to such transportation.
4

Now that is the, as I understand it, the only
5

arguable exception to the integrity of the method, because
6

the method demands that all -- the method won't work with
7

respect to carving out that aspect of gross income from
8

mining unless the denominator in that fraction included all
9

of the costs and the multiplier includes the gross income
10

from mining.

And since this taxpayer sold cement in bags and

1 1

charged a price for it, that whole price has to be included
12

because if it isn't, you don't get -- it's an approximated
13

method but the approximation you know, starts to depart from
14

the intended ambit of the depletion allowance which is to com­
15

pensate for the'-exhaustion of the mineral deposit and not to
16

compensate -- and not to provide any deduction for non-mining
17

activities.
18

QUESTION:

Well what if the taxpayer's price list

19

said on it, I'll sell cement to you either in bags or in
20

gross for exactly the same price per 100.
21

MR. SMITH:

For exactly the same price per 100?

22

Then I assume that, you know, people would either take it one
23

way or the other.

That doesn't mean the taxpayer is not

24

making a profit of, or it means that he's selling bagged
25

cement for less.
15

1

QUESTION:

And so what if he's -- had a price system,

2

says I'll sell you bulk cement for $2.00 and bagged cement
3

for $2.10?
4

HR. SMITH:

Yes?

5

QUESTION:

And so it doesn't make any difference

6

what his price list is.

Or what the cost of bagging is.

7

MR. SMITH:

No, it doesn't make any -- well, it

8

does make a -- your example makes a difference, but the point
9

is that his gross sale of his first marketable product in
10

that -- in your latter example, is either $2.00 or $2.10.
11

And we assume as -12

QUESTION:

And you said it wouldn't make any

13

differende to your case if it were stipulated that the cost
14

of bagging was $.20, would it?
15

MR. SMITH:

It wouldn't make any difference to me,

16

that the cost of bagging and in fact, you know, it was
17

essentially that there was

a disparity between the bagging

18

premium and the bagging costs in this case.

But essentially

19

all that means is that he's selling the cement for less.

I

20

mean, we have to assume that this taxpayer sold bagged
21

cement and you know, the Third Circuit more or less inferred
22

that in Whitehall, and there's an array of appellate authority
23

that rejects the notion that you can simply say well the
24

bagging aspects of this thing are just an entirely different
25

business, and that we're going to ignore them.
16

Because the

1

regulations provide with explicit direction that the first

2

marketable product is cement, no matter how it is packaged,

3

in either bulk or bagged form.

4

Court to page 8(a) of our appendix, which says here the first

5

marketable product means the product produced by the taxpayer

6

as a result of the application of non-mining processes .

7

the formal condition in which such product or products are

8

first marketed in significant quantities by the taxpayer,

9

is meant with specific reference to the cement industry, they

10

say here, for example, if a cement manufacturer sells his own

1 1

finished cement of

12

also sells

13

containing additives of finished cement of various types in

14

bulk and bags, constitutes the first marketable product.

16

MR. SMITH:

ready-mixed aggregates,

And your suggestion is that's a per­

missible construction of the statute?

QUESTION:

Now if I can, to refer the

b ut if it is,

Absolutely.
And that's -- if it isn't, you lose,

you should win?

MR.SMITH:

I think we should win because the

statute simply permits the Commissioner to permit the reason­
able allowance in all such cases, being made under regulations

23

prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate.

MR. SMITH:

Based upon his reading of this Court's

decision in Cannelton Sewer Pipe, which talked about commer­
cially marketable products.

Well isn't it a little strange to say

that there are three products that are the first marketable
product, even thought bulk cement, you have to do something
else to it to get it into bags?

Cement, no matter how it is packaged.
I know that is what you say -Yes.

Because in our view, bagging is

22

not a chemical or a physical process that adds, that alters

23

the character of the manufactured product.

24

product is Portland cement, whether it's in a railroad car --

25

the Fifth Circuit stated this with excrutiating detail -19

The manufactured

1

whether it's in a railroad car, or piggyback, or whatever,
2

it's still cement.
3

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Smith, is that consistent

4

with the Tenth Circuit's opinion at 14(a) of the petition,
5

down toward the bottom, where the Court there says the
6

government seeks to have ''bagged cement" be the "first
7

marketable product" and to so include the expenses associated
8

with the bagging.

Did the government take the same position

9

as the Tenth Circuit -10

MR. SMITH:

Oh well, that's really a mischaracteri-

1 1

zation of the government's position.

The government argued

12

that the first marketable product is finished cement, no
13

matter how it's packaged.

And I -- reading this most

14

charitably, I would assume that what the Court meant is that
15

government seeks to have bagged cement included in the first
16

marketable product, because it's the same cement, it's simply
17

put in a bag.
18

QUESTION:

One answer might be that the reason you

19

are here is because the Tenth Circuit, from your point of
20

view, did not understand the case?
21

MR. SMITH:

I think that's right.

I mean, the Tenth

22

Circuit took the position that bulk cement was the first
23

product and bagged cement was the second product, but -24

putting something in a bag is not the chemical or physical
25

processing that the Court in Cannelton averred to when it

But is it not true that in your analysis of the case, even if
they lost money on the bagged cement, say the bags were so
terribly expensive

—

Exactly, exactly.

And the suggestion,

and the argument that I'm making is simply not one that's
based upon regulations that we contend deserve great defer­
ence as legislative regulations.

The Court has held in a

variety of depletion cases, that the Commissioner has special
powers in the depletion area because the legislative author­
ity delegated -- the authority delegated to him is so broad,
but the Respondent is faced with an array of appellate
decisions in which the Court below stands as the sole exceptio n ?
that the first marketable product in this area is bulk and
bagged cement; that is, finished cement.

I would like, since

the second question is a subsidiary one, and I assume that
costs necessarily included.in the denominator flow from the
first opinion -- from the first question, I would like to save
my remaining time for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

Well just one more question.

Is your

case really boiled down and perhaps oversimplified, something
like the difference between buying a loaf of bread in Paris,
where you put it under your arm, and buying one at the
22

1

supermarket here, where it's all wrapped up in a package?

2

MR. SMITH:

Exactly, it's the same bread.

And if

3

there are tax deductions that -- or computations that flow

4

from that, that involve gross sales; if the supermarket

5

in the United States has to sell some -- has to raise the

6

price to take into account the bag, or if it doesn't those

7

sales have to be included in gross sales.

And I'd like to save the rest of my time for

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15

Mr. Bedell.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS P. BEDELL, ESQ.,

12

14

Very well.

MR. BEDELL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The question in this case seems to have been cast

16

in terms of preserving the integrity of a mathematical,

17

automatically functioning formula rather than in terms of

18

preserving the integrity of the purpose for which that formula

19

is being applied.

20

an integrated miner's gross income from mining.

21

The purpose, the purpose is to ascertain

QUESTION:

Well, let me put -- I am alternately

22

confused and find the case simplified.

23

that can first be sold, what can first be sold here?

24

MR. BEDELL:

25

QUESTION:

Bulk cement.

When and what is it

And bulk cement --

Is the case any more complicated than
23

1

that?
2

MR. BEDELL:

Not really.

That is, that is the

3

product that is sold in a substantial quantity.

And indeed,

4

as the Tenth Circuit has correctly recognized, bagging is
5

something that occurs additionally and it has a discreet
6

income component -7

QUESTION. Well this sounds as though you agree
8

with Mr. Smith, which I -9

MR. BEDELL:

I do not agree with Mr. Smith.

10

QUESTION:

-- it sounds as though you do, though.

11

MR. BEDELL:

No, --

12

QUESTION:

You say bagged cement is not a -- one

13

of

the first marketable products, or even part of it?

14

MR. BEDELL: I certainly do, because bulk cement is
15

sold in significant quantities.
16

QUESTION:

More bulk than bag.

17

MR. BEDELL:

Indeed.

Approximately 95 percent in

18

bulk.

This is the first product --

19

QUESTION:

Well now what if the situation

were

20

reversed, suppose there were more in bags than in bulk, only
21

one percent of bulk, would your position here be exactly the
22

same?
23

MR. BEDELL:

No, it would not.

Because you have to

24

have sufficient sales to establish the price so that you have
25

a meaningful first marketable product.

Well where Is that --

MR. BEDELL:

Just as in the case of our represen­

tative field price where the product is sold after mining
ends -QUESTION:

Where is that line of demarcation,

50 percent, 40 percent?
MR. BEDELL:

Cases in the depletion area under the

representative market or field price generally are found
10, 15, 20 percent.

It has to be determined with reference

to the realities of the market.
QUESTION:

What do you want to be included in your

gross sales figure, the multiplier there?

You just want the

-- your gross sales of bulk cement in that or not?
MR. BEDELL:

The sales figures should include the

gross sales of bulk cement and the sales value of the cement
which is sold In bags, because that also is the product of
cement rock which was mined by the taxpayer and manufactured
into finished cement.
QUESTION:

So you say that -- you say, along with

Mr. Smith then, that you include in the sales figures the
cement sold in bags?
MR. BEDELL:

You have to include an income figure

for cement sold in bags, and the proportionate profit formula
contemplates this, because it takes actual sales of the first
marketable product, sales of cement in bulk and with respect
25

1

to products that are second or third, a further processed
2

or product after first marketable product, they take the
3

constructed sales value derived from sales value applied to
4

the first marketable product.
5

QUESTION:

You used the word process, what was the

6

process in putting it in the bag?
7

MR. BEDELL:

It is the activity of putting it into

8

a bag, Mr. Justice Marshall.
9

QUESTION:

That's not a process is it?

10

MR. BEDELL:

It is not in the sense usually used

11

in the depletion area, it is not.
12

QUESTION:

Mr. Bedell, on the portion of the gross

13

sales that represent product that was bagged, what is the
14

constructive sales price that the taxpayer contended for?
15

Is it the equivalent of the unbagged cement, or is it the
16

actual price less the bagging cost?
17

MR. BEDELL:

The taxpayer took what is the less

18

favorable position; namely, less favorable to itself, of the
19

actual sales price less the bagging costs, because in this
20

case, as the Court has noted, the bagging cost exceeded the
21

bag premium

and the additional revenue generated by selling

22

the cement in bags rather than in bulk.

So the taxpayer took

23

sales figure of cement sold in bags, reduced that by the costs
24

of bagging, which was greater really than the additional
25

income generated by it, and put that in the sales figure that
26

1

then was allocated in accordance with the proportionate profits
2

formula.
3

QUESTION:

It doesn't seem to me that's consistent

4

with your basic position, that the sales cost is the cost of
5

the unbagged cement.

I mean, the sales price is the price

6

of the unbagged cement.

It may have been good tactics to do

7

it that way, because I see what you're saying, but I think
8

it's somewhat inconsistent.
9

MR. BEDELL:

The taxpayer was following the law

10

as had been set forth by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals,
1 1

in 1968 in the Ideal

Basic case.

When it interpreted the

12

manner in which the proportionate profits formula functioned
13

in the case of a cement manufacturer.
14

QUESTION:

Do you agree, by the way, that the govern

15

ment's position is the one that the regulation commands?

So

16

you must attack the regulations?
17

MR. BEDELL:

No, I do not agree with that.

It seems

18

to us that there is within the regulation, room to find a
19

result which is consistent with the purpose of the regulation
20

The language Mr. Smith read to us which said that the bulk
21

and packaged products are considered to be essentially the sam
22

product -- it doesn't say they are, it says they are con­
23

sidered to be -- that is language of presumption, not language
24

of absoluteness.

And when a result occurs under regulatory

25

language, that clearly is at conflict with a purpose of the
27

1

2
3
4

5

language, that it seems to me that this language is sus­
ceptible of being interpreted in a manner as to cure the
distortion which will result under Mr. Smith's interpretation.
And indeed, I think that distortion should be focused on,
because it is material to realize the manner in which the

6

purpose of the -- applying the formula is being frustrated.
7

Let's return momentarily, the purpose is to determine the
8

gross income from mining that is, the value of the taxpayer's
9

mineral that could have been realized had it been sold after
10

mining processes end, so we're looking to a market value for
1 1

the raw mineral product.

That's the purpose for which the

12

formula is being applied.
13

QUESTION:

And when did. the process

end, in your

14

view?
15

MR. BEDELL:

The mining process ends at the point

16

of kiln feed -- when that is introduced into the kiln, there
17

is no dispute between the government and the taxpayer with
18

respect to that.

But the taxpayer's cement

rock,

under

19

the government's interpretation, would have one value, if
20

that cement rock was manufactured into finished cement and
21

sold as bulk cement.

But a different value, the same identical

22

mineral, would have a different value if it was manufactured
23

into finished cement and sold in bags.

Or look at it differ­

24

ently.

In a given year, the taxpayer sold five percent of

25

its cement rock in the form of finished cement in bags, the
28

1

cement rock on an overall basis would have one value.

The

2

next year it sells 20 percent in bags from.the same cement
3

rock from the same quarry, assuming the same economic condi­
4

tions, drops in value.

On the other hand, if it went down

5

to zero instead of seven percent it had here, the cement
6

rock changes value.

This is the identical mineral, which

7

under the government's theory is having a change in value
8

because of this bagging activity, an activity which occurs
9

after all mining and all manufacturing processes have been
10

completed.
11

QUESTION:

What, to echo my brother Blackmun's

12

question, what if your client sold all his cement in bags,
13

and always had and always will?
14

HR. BEDELL:

15

bagged cement would be the first marketable product, because

22

taxpayer -23

QUESTION:

What if a competitor sold all his cement

QUESTION:

Although it would be an identical pro­

4

MR. BEDELL:

Under the proportionate profits

formula, yes.
6

QUESTION:

To carry it one step further, what if

7

the industry as a whole sold largely or totally in bulk?
8

And this one manufacturer sold it just in bags?
9

MR. BEDELL:

There would be -- because of the

10

manner in which the formula, mathematical formula operates,
11

there would be a different result.

Now the question is, in

12

this case, there are actual facts -13

QUESTION:

Right.

14

MR. BEDELL:

There are actual facts which can be

15

looked to, to avoid what is an unrealistic result from the
16

application of mechanical formula.

And that really is the

17

question:

can actual facts be taken into account?

The

18

bagging cost and the amount of additional income because it
19

is clear, on the record, that the taxpayer realized a certain
20

increment of revenue when it sold cement in bags rather
21

than in bulk.

An additional amount of revenue.

22

QUESTION:

Well how is that different from, say,

23

you have three or four methods of sales.

Some you sell throug|h

24

distributors and some on commission, and some through door25

to-door salesmen, and there are different sales costs for
30

1

ten percent of your business and another 20 and another 50,

2

but still all cement.

3

vary from year to year, the value of the mined product would

4

also vary from year to year, I suppose, would you say that

5

nevertheless, those are -- would you say that's all one

6

marketable product, or does it change from time to time?

7

Say

8

in smaller quantities at somewhat different prices because of

9

different sales techniques -- How is that any different than

10

that none of it was in bags but some of it was sold

the bagging problem?

itself, and so -QUESTION:

I'm leaving out transportation because

I'm just working on sales price.

17
18

One -- since the -- well, it seems

to me it is different in two reasons, because in the first,

15
16

Would you -- and those proportions

MR. BEDELL:

The other, the other thing is that

sales costs, sales costs are costs which a number of the
Courts that have looked at it, the lower Courts, have decided
are cost

allocable both to the mining and the manufacturing

activity.
QUESTION:

Well' that's exactly what -- say the

bags are allocated to both, too.
MR. BEDELL:

Right, they allocate -- well, the

government though, under its interpretation of the formula
31

1

2

would allocate the cost of bagging solely to the manu­
facturing non-mining side.

3

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Bedell --

QUESTION:

That goes into the total figure,

4

5

6

doesn't it?

Just as the sales costs go into the total figure.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that -- say you have a

7

general sales manager, where is his salary?
8

MR. BEDELL:

The salary of a general sales manager

9

should be treated as both in the numerator of the formula
10

and in the denominator.
11

QUESTION:

Is that what you did in your tax

12

return?
13

MR. BEDELL:

Again, following the Tenth Circuit,

14

the Tenth Circuit interprets -15

QUESTION:

Yes, or no, did you or did you not?

16

MR. BEDELL:

No.

Because that is not the matter

17

which the Tenth Circuit interprets.
18

QUESTION:

If one reads the statutory language

19

itself, 611(a), the general rule, in talking about mines,
20

it says that the -- a large depletion for depreciation

in different cases.
Obviously, administrative convenience and simplic­
ity require ignoring some variations, but when you have
variations that are supported by definite facts such as
in this case, peculiar circumstances, what we have here,
ascertainable income items and ascertainable costs asso­
ciated with the bagging activity, then that is the type of
case which it should be dealt with.

Exactly, exactly.

And indeed that is what the Tenth Circuit has
consistently held, the Ideal Basic case in 1968, the Port­
land Cement Company of Utah case in 1979, and then in
this case.

Becuase this actual fact, it is a factor which

can be taken into account and supports the determination
as the Tenth Circuit has held that the first marketable
product was cement in bulk.
The confusion between the premise, the premise
of the proportionate profits formula and the purpose which
it serves of trying to find gross income for mining, has
clouded the issue and in many contexts that's been looked at
up until now.
There

is

distortion

ORAL REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
1 1

12
13
14

15
16

MR. SMITH:

on actual facts is belied by the provisions of the regulation
which provide that the Commissioner may determine that a
method of computation is more appropriate than the propor­
tionate profits method or the method being used by the tax­
payer, and that the taxpayer can request such a determination,
of an alternative method.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

I think that the Respondent's emphasis

Here, the taxpayer has, because of its integrated
status and the absence of a representative field price,

has

invoked the proportionate profits method of computing its
gross income from mining.

It hasn't sought to bring any

actual facts to the Commissioner before going into this liti­
gation.

The proportionate profits method provides in detail

as in the language I read to the Court about a cement manu­
facturer and we talk about the flexibility of the regulations.
The regulations provide at page 21(a) of our appendix with
35

1

precise reference to this case, if a cement manufacturer
2

et cetera, et cetera.

There was no room for any flexible

3

reading, what

the Respondent seeks in this case is nothing

4

less than an invalidation of these regulations which three
5

Courts of Appeals have approved and which the Court below
6

stands in sole and persistent invalidation of and there's no
7

way that one can read these regulations in a flexible way to
8

take account of what Respondent

seeks in this case, which

9

in our view is nothing less than an expanded

depletion

10

allowance that would include part

of its non-mining income.

11

The cost ratio method is indeed an approximation,
12

but it is an approximation which is designed to take into
13

account the fact that each dollar of costs produces a pro­
14

portionate amount of gross sales -15

QUESTION:

Well that in itself is something of a

16

fiction.
17

MR. SMITH:

Well of course it's a fiction, but --

18

QUESTION:

Or at least --

19

MR. SMITH:

-- it's an approximation which is based

20

upon the fact that there's no really better way to do it,
21

and regulations like that, the choice that the Commissioner
22

makes in areas like technical area like depletion, and in
23

othe areas of the Code, has been consistently upheld by this
24

Court and by the Court and basically -25

QUESTION:

Your point is that this taxpayer

Putting a cement -- putting cement in a bag is,

in our view and in the view of the regulations, not processing
It doesn't alter the character of the cement, the cement
whether it's in a tankcar, or whether it's in a bag, is still
Portland Cement.

That was the Respondent's first marketable

9

product and the gross sales of those things -- if the taxpayer
10

had sold Portland Cement at a great killing at a very high
11

price, whether it would still be in gross sales -- in other
12

words, you know, it may produce some variations or some
13

distortions, or if the;market goes down it would still be in

14

gross sales.

And the fact that, you know, it sought to

15

satisfy a particular kind of demand of

small customers in

16

the construction industry for 94 pounds, bags of cement,
17

that was part of its business.

QUESTION:

Did you say that --

19

MR. SMTIH:

And if it's part of its business --

QUESTION:

Did you say for the same reason that

20

21

sales expense after bagging is included?
22

MR. SMTIH:

Sales expense after bagging to get it to

23

the customer is -- goes into the denominator, exactly.
24

QUESTION:

For the same reason, the same reason.

25

MR. SMITH:

Exactly, exactly.
37

And for all -- for

1

all those purposes we think think that the judgment should

2

be reversed.
