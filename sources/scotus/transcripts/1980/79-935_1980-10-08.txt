ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. FITZGIBBON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

10

We'll hear arguments next

MR. FITZGIBBON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is a multi-facet case which arose out of

11

the 8th Circuit.

12

not collateral estoppel applies when a prisoner seeks to invoke

13

the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court under 42 United

14

States Code Section 1983.

15

It concerns the proposition as to whether or

In this particular case the 8th Circuit held that

16

because of the special role of the federal courts in protecting

17

civil rights and because habeas corpus is now unavailable to

18
19

20

the appellant in this case under the decision of Stone v.
Powell, it is the duty of that court to consider fully, unen­
cumbered by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the appellant's
1983 claims.

21

This goes back to a number of decisions of this Court,
22

and I guess you would have the starting point would be the
23

original Ku Klux Klan Act, or the Civil Rights Act, wherein the
24

Congress gave the power to federal courts to determine
25

3

1

constitutional rights and to give persons remedies for damages
2

and a federal forum to air their constitutional claims, the
3

reason being that there was great distrust that the state courts
4
5

would not comply with federal constitutional law, and make a
mockery of justice.

6
7

However, this particular Act has been somewhat modi­
fied.

I believe this Court has stated that the state courts

8

are able to

9

constitutional law, and that some trust has to be placed in

10

rule

constitutional issues involving federal

state courts concerning this issue.

11

Going back to the Civil Rights Act, I believe that in

12

this day and age things have drastically changed and that state

13

courts are applying constitutional law, federal constitutional

14

law, and are complying with all decisions of this particular

15

Court, especially in the role of search and seizure.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Fitzgibbon, can I ask you a question

17

about the procedural posture of this case?

18

the respondent in this case was convicted in the trial court,

19

or his motion to suppress was denied, and he had an appeal

20

21

22
23
24
25

As I understand it

pending to the Missouri state courts on that point at the time
he brought his 1983 question.
MR. FITZGIBBON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And the Court of Appeals for the 8th

Circuit didn't -- although it said you can't use collateral
estoppel once the state process is finished, it directed the
4

1

Federal District Court to abstain
2

perfected his appeal through the Missouri court system.

5

6
7

9
10

while he, the defendant,

MR. FITZGIBBON:

Right.

And also the 8th Circuit has

reference to the Missouri Court of Appeals decision in that case
regarding the hearing that he had on his motion to suppress the
evidence.

They were aware of that particular decision and it

so states in their decision.
QUESTION:

And did the case go to the Missouri

Supreme Court, Mr. Fitzgibbon?
MR. FITZGIBBON:

No, it did not.

It is limited on

11

this particular issue to the Missouri Court of Appeals so that

12

there was no further --

13
14

QUESTION:

Could he have gone to the Missouri

Supreme Court?

15

MR. FITZGIBBON:

16

QUESTION:

Pardon me?

Could the defendant have taken his convic­

17

tion to the Missouri Supreme Court?

18

MR. FITZGIBBON:

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

No, Your Honor, not under our law.

It would have to stop at the Missouri Court of Appeals, and it
would not go to the Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

Or could it have come here from the

Missouri Court of Appeals?
MR. FITZGIBBON:

From the Missouri Court of Appeals?

It could have come here by way of certiorari.

And of course,

under Stone v. Powell, it couldn't very well come here under
5

1
habeas corpus.

2
QUESTION:

No, but cert, might have been sought here

3

from the Missouri Court of Appeals?
4

MR. FITZGIBBON:

It could have come very well by

5

petition for certiorari to this particular Court.
6

QUESTION:

Bring me up to date.

What is the status

7

of the criminal case on the state side?
8
9
10

11

MR. FITZGIBBON:

Has it been affirmed?

It was affirmed by the Missouri

Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Was cert, applied for?

MR. FITZGIBBON:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. FITZGIBBON:

Pardon me?

Was cert, applied for?
I am not familiar with that particu­

14

lar point because I am not the prosecutor in the case, I repre­

15

sent the police officers.

16

or not I really don't know, in this particular case.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

When you speak of cert, are you speaking

of cert, to the highest court in Missouri?
MR. FITZGIBBON:

20

Court of the United States.

21

or not that's —

22
23
24
25

Whether or not cert, was applied for

QUESTION:

No, sir.

Certiorari to the Supreme

I am not familiar as to whether

Well, certiorari from the Missouri Court

of Appeals which for this case is the highest court in Missouri.
There is no right to go to the Supreme Court of Missouri on
the criminal case, as I understand that.
6

Am I correct?

1

MR. FITZGIBBON:
2
3

is final.

It appears that in the -QUESTION.:

I'm sorry, Mr. Fitzgibbon, did the Missouri

Court of Appeals decide the Fourth Amendment claim?

6
7

No.

The Missouri Court of Appeals determines those issues and that

4
5

No, not under our state law.

MR. FITZGIBBON:

Yes, Your Honor, they did.

They

decided that the search and seizure was lawful and that he was

8

convicted upon constitutional standards of search and seizure

9

and therefore his conviction should be affirmed.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FITZGIBBON:

12

On federal law, and they so cited

the federal rules concerning that in federal cases.
QUESTION:

13
14

And that turned on federal law?

Couldn't that issue have been taken to the

Missouri Supreme Court?

15

MR. FITZGIBBON:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. FITZGIBBON:

No, Your Honor.

I see.
I guess you'd have to go back to

18

the Civil Rights Act to find out what the effect was and whe­

19

ther or not collateral estoppel should apply.

20
21

22
23

The federal rules,

federal cases, cases of this Court, I guess seem to indicate
that there are some common law defenses available in a 1983
action.

And some of those defenses would be, for instance,

judicial immunity under Stump v. Sparkman and recognized de­
fenses to 1983 actions.

And this is imbedded into the common

24

law.

And the question is whether or not should the common law

25

7

1
2
3
4
5
6
7

defenses be now abandoned because of 42 U.S. Code Section 1983?
There are recognized defenses to that.
the statute of limitations.

For instance,

If you don't file your claim with­

in a certain period of time, you don't have any claim any more.
Of course, that being statutory law it is imbedded that stale
claims should not be heard by courts.
In this particular instance, I think there is no

8

doubt that the common law always did recognize that collateral

9

estoppel will apply, that if you have had a fair and full

10

hearing on an issue, in my words, you only get one bite at the

11

apple, the idea being to give some finality to litigation.

12

has to stop somewhere.

It

13

Now, the issue in this particular case is if the

14

prisoner in this particular case was given a full and fair

15

hearing in the state court's suppression of the evidence case.

16

Does he now have a right, notwithstanding the fact that it has

17

been shown by the Missouri Court of Appeals that the search

18

was legal and constitutional, can he now go to the Federal

19
20

21
22
23

District Court on a petition for damages and relitigate that
same issue which has been litigated before in a state criminal
proceeding?
QUESTION:

Counsel, certainly that issue is here, but

straighten me out on one other little detail.
assault claim here also, isn't there?

24

MR. FITZGIBBON:

Right.

25

8

There is an

1
QUESTION:
2
3
4

And there is a statement in some of the

briefs on the other side that Judge Meredith, if it was Judge
Meredith, bypassed or failed to pass upon that issue.

What's

your comment on that one?

5

MR. FITZGIBBON:

When we started off this case I

6

asked the court for partial summary judgment on the issue that

7

we're here on today, and the court, I guess inadvertently,

8

granted me full summary judgment, which I really didn-'t ask for.

9

I was willing to go to trial with the assault.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FITZGIBBON:

12

So that may have to go back?
That -- yes; yes.

That probably will

be tried.

13

QUESTION:

That was remanded by the Court of Appeals?

14

MR. FITZGIBBON:

That was remanded and that issue

15

should be tried.

16

this issue into the eye of the Court so they could rule on this

17

particular thing in our Circuit.

18
19
20

I didn't address that issue; I wanted to get

Now, some of the cases have made distinctions on
whether or not you voluntarily go into a court, submit to their
jurisdiction, get a result which you don't like, and then try
to relitigate that same issue.

I don't think the test is whe­

21

ther you voluntarily go into court.

In Montana v. United States

22
the United States Government voluntarily went into court, into
23

a state court involving a constitutional issue and asked the
24

court to rule on those issues, and the court did.
25

9

1

Then the United States tried to get into the federal

2
3
4
5

system, to have another bite at that particular apple when the
court in the state court had ruled the federal constitutional
issues in that particular case.

Now, the cases that were cited

by the 8th Circuit, or where they say that -- well, these cases

6

were before Stone v. Powell, and therefore, since Stone v.

7

Powell has taken away habeas corpus on Fourth Amendment viola­

8

tions, virtually, that therefore we have to have a federal foruir

9

and some of these cases go off on the theory, well, since it’s

10

a criminal case, the prisoner didn't ask to be in the courtroom

11

and the prisoner didn't really ask to have these particular

12

issues decided but he was forced to be there and he was forced

3

to bring up these issues -- and they take off on a tack saying,

4

well, if he wants to have a 1983 action for damages, then he

5

can't litigate that in the state court, he's going to get con­

6

victed because he's not going to bring that up.

7

absolutely false.
If a person is in court and is going, may have to do

8
9

20
21

I think that's

some time,

he is going to bring up that particular issue of

suppression of the evidence and litigate that as fully as pos­
sible.

I think the last thought in somebody's mind who is in

that courtroom is, oh boy, my damage claim is going to come up
22
23

now, they are vitally interested in having an acquittal in that
particular case.

24

QUESTION:

Is his damage claim for assault against the

25

10

1

officers that he shot or some other officers?

2
3
4

MR. FITZGIBBON:

In his motion -- he had a cross mo­

tion for summary judgment and in that cross motion for summary
judgment he identified another police office who he alleges

5

assaulted him while he was lying on the ground with his hands

6

behind his back.

7

didn't have anything to do with the particular assault because

8

they were immediately, got medical aid and they were taken off

9

to the hospital.

10

The two officers that he shot, of course,

So it would be a third officer who he identi­

fied in his cross petition for summary judgment.
I don't think that the test is whether an issue is

11
12

decided, whether you're there voluntarily or involuntarily.

13

I think that the test that should be applied in state court

14

proceedings is to whether or not he had a full and fair oppor­

15
16
17
18

tunity to litigate this particular issue, to present witnesses
on behalf of himself on the suppression issue, and that that
should be binding,

and if the state court finds that this is

constitutional.
QUESTION:

19

What would you say if the state court

finding had been the other way and that the evidence was
20

excluded?
21

MR. FITZGIBBON:

If the evidence was excluded —

22

QUESTION:

And then this suit were brought against

23

these particular police officers and the plaintiff claimed
24

that the issue had been concluded in the criminal trial and he
25

11

1

needn't present any evidence?
2
3
4

MR. FITZGIBBON:

lieve, that the transcript of the testimony in that case could
be by stipulation introduced to reach a result.

5

6

QUESTION:

You say that the police officers can use

MR. FITZGIBBON:

8

QUESTION:

Right.

But you wouldn't say that a plaintiff

could use a contrary judgment offensively?

10

11

But the --

this judgment in the criminal case defensively?

7

9

There is one case which holds, I be­

MR. FITZGIBBON:

He could go back, if

the issue is

decided in his favor, certainly, under 1983.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. FITZGIBBON:

We have different parties then.
It could go in.

I don't think the

14

courts have distinguished in collateral estoppel or what they

15

call issue preclusion; or — you have three things -QUESTION:

16

When the police officers had never had an

17

opportunity to litigate and argue in good faith and so forth?

18

That could be precluded.
MR. FITZGIBBON:

19

20

were determined in his favor that the search was unlawful -QUESTION:

21

-- then he could fully litigate his

1983 claims in the Federal District Court.
QUESTION:

24
25

Right.

MR. FITZGIBBON:

22
23

As I understand the question, if it

ment?

Litigate, but could he get summary judg­

I think that was what Justice White was asking.
12

1

MR. FITZGIBBON:
2
3
4

7

You couldn't get summary

judgment because then it depends on whether or not there was
good faith and probable cause to recognize defenses to actions
for illegal search and seizure.

5

6

No, no.

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume that in the criminal

trial it was predetermined there was not probable cause.

Would

that issue be open in a 1983 suit?

8

MR. FITZGIBBON:

9

QUESTION:

10

It would be open in a 1983 suit?

Yes.

MR. FITZGIBBON:

Or he could proceed to trial, in a

11

jury trial against the police officers.

12

upon the police officers.
QUESTION:

13

It's not preclusive

But typically, in your criminal trial, a

14

motion to suppress may be granted notwithstanding the good

15

faith immunity of the officers in a 1983 action, and if

16

there were then, the motion to suppress were granted, wouldn't

17

that be conclusive as to the violation of the constitutional

18

rights in a 1983 action, so that the only matter open would be

19

the good faith of the officers?
MR. FITZGIBBON:

20
21

22
23

I think at that time the good faith

of the — many times the officers may violate the Constitution
inadvertently through lack of knowledge on their part of what
the law is,
officer.

the law is such a morass of rules for the police

I don't think they intentionally try to violate any­

24

body's rights, they violate by inadvertence.

fensive collateral estoppel.

QUESTION:

Well, actually, isn't that issue here

because isn't it true that the Missouri court did suppress evii

dence found in the drawer and in a tire?

11

MR. FITZGIBBON:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And suppose they have therefore decided

13

as a matter of collateral estoppel that to that extent there

14

was a violation of Fourth Amendment rights?

15

MR. FITZGIBBON:

No, Your Honor, because the whole

16

posture of this particular case was based on a conspiracy of

17

the two officers to conduct an illegal search, the two officers

18

that were shot by this prisoner.

19
20

21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

And we have a state court adjudication that

there was some violation of the Fourth Amendment rights in this
MR. FITZGIBBON:
QUESTION:

Not by them.

Not by them?

MR. FITZGIBBON:

No.

The whole tenor of the thing is

that these two police officers who came up to the door to buy
narcotics conspired to illegally have a search and seizure of
14

1

this particular property.

2
3

QUESTION:

looked in the tires is not a defendant?

4
5

The officer who opened the drawer and

MR, FITZGIBBON:
Brand.

Is not a defendant.

That's Officer

He is a different -- he was called the seizing officer

6

in the case.

7

The posture is that he started, he alleges that our two police

8

officers conspired to illegally search his home.

9

But that is not the particular issue in this case.

QUESTION:

I know it's really not relevant but I have

10

some problems with your damage theory that you're going to, that

11

they're going to wrestle with if they win; but -MR. FITZGIBBON:

12
13

If you're talking about the stuff

which was suppressed, it's narcotics.
QUESTION:

14

What are his --

I'm trying to understand if it was not

15

suppressed, if they -- I would hate to be the trial judge trying

16

to decide how to apportion, how to award damages if you ulti­

17

mately lose.
MR. FITZGIBBON:

18

QUESTION: Mr. Fitzgibbon, no reference is made, is

19
20

Well, that's another problem that we have .

there, in the appellate court's decision to Mincey v. Arizona?
MR. FITZGIBBON:

21

of Mincey v. Arizona?

No.

In the appellate, in the 8th Circuit,
The 8th Circuit made no mention of

22
23

that.
QUESTION:

I just wonder on the issue of collateral

24

estoppel, because that's intervening law; it's relevant here.
25

15

1

What then was the posture of your collateral estoppel?
2

4

MR. FITZGIBBON:

the Missouri Court of Appeals went into this particular issue
and said that --

5
6

QUESTION:

Doesn't Mincey v. Arizona have some bearing

on the resolution of that?

7
8

Are you saying that because -- well,

MR. FITZGIBBON:

on that particular issue --

Under Mincey?

10

MR. FITZGIBBON:

QUESTION:

Oh, did it?

QUESTION:

Which court of appeals are you referring

And said -- yes, Your Honor.

to now?

4

MR. FITZGIBBON:

5

of Appeals, not to the 8th Circuit.

6

didn't even get into the issue as to whether or not these facts

7

show that there was an illegal search and seizure.

It wouldn't be in the brief, it would be in

proceeding, the criminal proceeding.

4

QUESTION:

Ordinarily in Missouri, if the court holds

that the contraband was unlawfully seized, do they give it back
to him or is it --

7
8

I think he was only interested in the

9

It's contraband; it has to be destroyed.
QUESTION:

That's what I was thinking.

MR. FITZGIBBON:

If you want to get into the issue of

what was the street value of the heroin, and that's the ques­

12

tion of damages, I don't see how we're going to reach that.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. FITZGIBBON:

I have come to a further conclusion

on this case concerning the exclusionary rule, and in Stone
v. Powell this Court went into the exclusionary rule and the
results concerning this, that there is probably some displeasure
with the exclusionary rule because it, I guess it shunts away
whether or not a person is guilty or innocent and goes into the

evidence, whether or not this evidence was seized legally or

illegally.

It seems that if the exclusionary rule were abolished

MR. FITZGIBBON:

I don't think it's a -- under 1983

I don't believe that there is any history, that the framers of

6

that particular law and the congressional reports on this show

7

any indication that they wish to abolish collateral estoppel.

8

10

QUESTION:

Well, historically, hasn't collateral

estoppel required some mutuality or not?
MR. FITZGIBBON:

I believe the courts have gone fur­

11

ther, and mutuality -- you mean the mutuality of the same

12

parties and the same issues?

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

14

MR. FITZGIBBON:

No, that would be res judicata.

15

But they talk of collateral estoppel where the issue is put

16

into focus and there's a full trial, full, fair-hearing

17

on that, that that should be collateral estoppel on this par­

QUESTION:

Let me ask you, do you know what the result

would be in the Missouri courts if there was a suit under state
law against these officers for illegal search and seizure?
MR. FITZGIBBON:

They could go either way in our

state courts.
QUESTION:

Well, would the state courts say that the

legality of the search had already been determined in the
19

criminal trial and so dismiss the case on collateral estoppel
grounds or not?
MR. FITZGIBBON:
QUESTION:

If a full and fair hearing were --

Is that the Missouri rule?

MR. FITZGIBBON:

Yes.

I think counsel has given me

the case of LaRose v. Casey and the answer is, yes.
QUESTION:

So you think that if a 1983 suit were

brought in the state courts, the Missouri courts would dismiss
the case on collateral estoppel grounds?
MR. FITZGIBBON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

If you had no assault element.

MR. FITZGIBBON:

Right.

I'm just talking about the

search and seizure matter.
QUESTION:

Well, your colleague on the other side

doesn't agree with that, does he, or not?
MR. FITZGIBBON:
QUESTION:

I don't think he does.

Do you think it makes any difference what

Missouri law is in this case, or is it just a question of
federal law?
MR. FITZGIBBON:

It's a question of collateral estop­

pel under the common law.
QUESTION:

Well, should we look to see what the result

would be in Missouri or .would it be just a uniform rule country­
wide, a matter of federal law?

mention the decision of this Court in Stefanelli v. Minard at
342 US which strikes me as being very much on point with your
case, except there there the injunction was sought under 1983

before the evidence was introduced and it was an effort to

9

enjoin the use by the prosecution of the evidence in the crimi­

10

nal case .

11
12

MR. FITZGIBBON:

There's an adequate remedy in the

Mr. Fitzgibbon, assuming that the defendant

suppressed the evidence in a state court proceeding and then he
was indicted on a similar charge brought in the federal court,
would he be able to plead in the federal court collateral
estoppel and prevent the federal prosecutor from using the

Then we're really not talking about the

broader concept.

MR. FITZGIBBON:

QUESTION:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm not saying it's wrong, but it's not

apply in other areas too.
MR. FITZGIBBON:

The doctrine, the common law doctrine

of collateral estoppel.
22

Well, your point is that 1983 actions

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

We asked

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

11

No.

MR. SHANK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I think it particularly appropriate at this time,

14

possibly, to review briefly the factual setting for clarifica­

15

tion purposes.

16

Respondent filed his civil rights action alleging

17

three general areas, one,the assault matter, which has been

18

discussed with the Court; secondly, he raised a search question

19

in two areas, one, a conspiracy situation and secondly alleging

20
21

22
23

individual defendants.
The petitioner filed his motion to dismiss and motion
for partial summary judgment.

He alleged in the motion to dis­

miss as to the assault, failure to state a cause of action, and
as to the remainder in that motion to dismiss, res judicata.

24

As to his motion for partial summary judgment, he

to dismiss and used the terminology under the summary judgment.

10

That's unclear.

11

The District Court said that the only issue that it

12

had was whether or not the entrance into the respondent's home

13

was lawful and that this was litigated in state court.

14

state court in the criminal proceedings at the trial level

Well, are you — was this just, was this

an inadvertent oversight, are you suggesting, that no review

Or how

are we to take your answer?
MR. SHANK:

I don't think the respondent had the

knowledge or the ability at that time to proceed with the writ
22

of certiorari before this Court.

I can't tell the Court that it

23

was an intelligent or a knowing decision not to seek a writ of

If the Court would be asking, would that be providing a

remedy, as opposed to the federal court, to proceed in a civil
rights action to review the matter, we would suggest that the
congressional and legislative history of 1983, the fact that
the District Court would be able to give a more inclusive fact­

QUESTION:

When was the damage action against the

police officers commenced, approximately again?

Before or after

the Court of Appeals decision?
MR. SHANK:
QUESTION:

Before it.
Well, then, he was aware at the time the

Court of Appeals decision came down that he was, had a suit
22
23

pending for damages against the officers involving the very
elements concerned in the Court of Appeals.

Isn't that so?

He would have been aware of that; yes, sir.

Well, would you think his counsel was aware

MR. SHANK:

If the Court is asking me if he was aware

if counsel was aware that a civil rights action had been filed,
I would tend to believe he probably was not, because the respon­

assistance of counsel, I'm sure, at that time.

12

Federal District Court's decision.
QUESTION:

the tenor of the petition filed, or the complaint filed in the

Mr. Shank, returning for a moment to the

failure of your client to seek certiorari here from the Court of
Appeals of Missouri judgment

affirming the conviction, isn't

one of the underpinnings of our opinion, Stone v. Powell, the

right that -- the fact that this Court is open to remedy

erroneous rulings on search and seizure? And if you allow a

Well, sir, in the Stone v. Powell matter

I believe the Court indicated that if a state court provided a

Of course, if there was a
if there was, if the court

found that there was that denial, then of course habeas would
be available.

And likewise, if we get into the realm of the

collateral estoppel issue, the ruling on the habeas might well
22
23

void the conviction itself, so collateral estoppel would never
come into play.

24

QUESTION:

But do you make any claim that there was

33

not a full and fair hearing in the Missouri courts on the

search and seizure issue?

3

MR. SHANK:

No, we did not raise that claim before

this Court.

5

QUESTION:

Well, indeed, you have to assume that

6

there was a full and fair hearing, otherwise federal habeas

Appeals for the 8th Circuit would be inapplicable.

MR. SHANK:

We would have proceeded through

11
12

Correct.

QUESTION:

Of course, the other side of this coin

that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has raised is that if collateral

first place, because I don't believe there was mutuality of the
parties, so the federal court never would have been able to
present the issue.
QUESTION:

All I'm asking -- if you are urging that

as part of your position?
24

MR. SHANK:

No, sir.

Our position would be in the

issue before this Court, collateral estoppel is inapplicable.

QUESTION:

3

MR. SHANK:

4
5

But not for that reason?

QUESTION:

Not for that reason.
Doesn't the 8th Circuit opinion really

fall between two stools, in effect, and they leave what could

6

be arguably the worst possible result?

7

for the Federal District Court not to intervene in 1983 until

8

the matter has gone all the way through the state courts, but

9

then it may intervene.

10

MR. SHANK:

11

QUESTION:

It says, in effect,

That's correct.
So that if you're talking about considera­

12

tions of federalism or comity, perhaps there is a greater

13

affront to the state systems if the federal court does not

14

intervene until it's, say, gone to the highest court of the

15

state, and then the federal court decides differently than the

16

highest court of the state.
MR. SHANK:

17
18
19
20

But we feel that we would not be inter­

fering with the comity of federalism because we would never be
in a position asking necessarily for the state conviction to be
overturned, we're not asking that a person in respondent's
case be removed from jail, we're not asking that the state limit

21

or

revise

the

application

of, say, the exclusionary rule.

22
23

So we don't feel that we're really interfering with the state
court.

Collateral estoppel.

About mutuality.

There is no mutuality in my understanding

of collateral estoppel in the State.

QUESTION:

So that if there were a suit in the state

6

courts similar to this suit here, it wouldn't be thrown out on

7

-- or there would be no mutuality requirement?

8
9

MR. SHANK:

Correct, sir, and we would have a set of

circumstances similar to that's before this Court, the defen­

10

dant in that case could raise the doctrine of collateral

11

estoppel quite possibly.
QUESTION:

12

And what would the Missouri -- well, and

what do you think the state courts would say?

MR. SHANK:

No, sir, I don't.

I'd be glad to brief

that to the Court.
QUESTION:

15

Mr. Shank, I take it from what you say

16

that if instead of having a Fourth Amendment issue you had a

17

Fifth -- say you were bringing a 1983 case on the theory that

18

a confession had been extorted by force or violence, would

19

collateral estoppel apply in that situation?
MR. SHANK:

20
21

22
23
24
25

In that situation a habeas corpus remedy

would be available and in that circumstance the federal forum
would be available and we would -- again, our position would be
the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act clearly pre­
cludes it.

But quite possibly that would be a logical course

to follow.

QUESTION:

Mr. Shank, I'm not clear on one thing.

You

argue that the collateral estoppel defense does not apply in the
1983 action for the reason that a federal forum must be avail­
able to try these issues.

Now, would that reasoning apply

if you brought a 19 8 3 action in the state court, which, as one
of my colleagues suggested, you could?

QUESTION:

I gather

what you're saying is the

contour of the 1983 action, whether brought in federal or state

QUESTION:

Even though your reason for asserting the

13

need for disregarding the defense would not apply if you electee

14

to sue in the state court?

15

MR. SHANK:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And even though you could come here from

17

the highest court of Missouri if you felt the highest court of

18

Missouri had misinterpreted 1983?

19
20

21
22
23
24
25

MR. SHANK:

Correct, but I think that choice would be

as open for respondent.

He was compelled into the state court

situation by whatever reason.

His first opportunity to make a

choice as to which court he wants to go into would be after
the Missouri -- in this case, the Missouri Court of Appeals had
filed its ruling.

There would be no other way for him to pre­

serve his federal claim.

He's basically forced to have it
40

1

ruled upon in the state court, because if he does not he cer­
2
3
4
5

tainly would risk conviction.

And I don't think as a practical

matter that many people would want to take that risk involved.
We then get to — to follow that up, if I may, we then get to
the point, then, if the state courts are able to preclude the

6

litigation of civil rights under the Civil Rights Act, under

7

those circumstances the Civil Rights Act for all intents and

8

purposes would be dead in the majority of the cases.

9

QUESTION:

Well, what do you do with Stefanelli v.

10

Minard, which refused to enjoin the use of evidence in a state

11

court even though the contention was that it had been seized

12

contrary to the Fourth Amendment?
MR. SHANK:

13

Well that, I would say, if it's come to

14

those certain set of circumstances, the Court was merely ab­

15

staining to let a state court make its determination, then cer­

16

tainly I don't think that would necessarily have to preclude

17

the litigation of the issue later on once the state court had

18

finished.

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

If I may, to restate the issue we are asking this
Court specifically to rule on, it is whether or not collateral
estoppel is inapplicable in 1983 actions alleging Fourth Amend­
ment violations when the collateral estoppel would violate 1983
legislative intent to provide a viable federal forum in which
someone could vindicate his Fourth Amendment rights.

As the

Court is well aware, this Court has never considered this
41

1

particular issue on point.

Prior to 1976 in the Stone v.

Powell decision, there had only been two federal appellate
courts that had ruled.

Subsequent to 1976, other than the

court below in this matter, there has only been two matters
ruled on, two cases ruled on.

Recently a 9th Circuit case,

6

in August, 1980, ruled that collateral estoppel would be inap­

7

plicable, and in particular it noted that because there was

8

no right to appeal to the Supreme Court, it felt that the

9

collateral estoppel would not be applicable.

10

All those cases, these latter cases, rely heavily on

11

the legislative history, which clearly show that the Civil

Rights Act was intended to -MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Right, I understand.

I'm not talking about

I'm talking about the 1983 suit for damages

trary to the position your client would take in 1983. You say nc
collateral estoppel there, also?
MR. SHANK:

Yes, sir.

44

In a broad sense of it, I would

be in a position to suggest that we don't feel that the legis­

Suppose there's

a Fourth Amendment claim brought in on federal habeas claiming

that there wasn't a full and fair hearing in the state court

7

and the Federal District Court agrees, holds a new hearing, and

8

finds that there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment and

9

denies the petition for habeas corpus.

Then the petitioner who

is a defendant in the state court in the criminal action sues

on 1983 claiming a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and sues
