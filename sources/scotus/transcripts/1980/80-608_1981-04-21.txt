ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case is here on direct appeal from the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
That court held unconstitutional as applied to appellees an
act of Congress governing the deposit of materials into letter
boxes used by the Postal Service for the delivery of United
States mail.

The statutory provision involved is Section 1725

15

of Title 18, United States Code.

That section prohibits the

16

knowing and willful deposit of any mailable matter on which
17

postage has not been paid into a letter box that has been
18

established by the Postal Service or has been accepted or ap­
19

proved by the Postal Service for the receipt or delivery of
20

mail along any mail route.
21

QUESTION:

And that's true even though the box is

22

/

privately owned?

/

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.

24

QUESTION:

The box is privately owned, isn't it?

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, in general, the boxes are fur­

2

nished by the mail customer but the Postal Service regulations

3

require the furnishing of an appropriate receptacle for the

4

receipt of mail as a condition to the delivery of mail --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

At the customer's expense?
At the customer's expense.

There are

7

circumstances, I am informed by the Postal Service, in which

8

the Postal Service itself will construct letter boxes.

9

a program of relatively recent origin.

It occurs

This is

particularly

10

in new subdivisions where the builder has perhaps neglected to

11

put in what are called cluster boxes, which are groups of boxes

12

at the end of the block to serve all the houses up the block.
QUESTION:

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14
15

And who pays for those?
The Postal Service will pay for those

letter boxes because there occasionally have been disputes as
to whether the builder or the homeowners or whoever --

16

QUESTION:

And the Postal Service has the keys?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

The Postal Service has the keys; that's

18

correct.
19

QUESTION:

And the owner does not have the keys?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Excuse me?

21

QUESTION:

The owner does not have a key to the back

22
of it.

He only has a key for the door.

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

The owner would — the person

24

to whom the mailbox

pertains would only have a key to his own

do they not?

MR. KNEEDLER:

They don't have locks on them.

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, they don’t.

13

QUESTION:

Everyone drops newspapers and everything

14

else in them.
15

MR, KNEEDLER:

Well, under the statute, other persons

16

are not permitted to deposit other materials into those boxes.
17

QUESTION:

Even in those?

Even though they’re not

18

lockable?
19

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

Yes, this statute

20

applies to boxes, whether they are locked or unlocked.

QUESTION:

Well, what are non-lockable bins or troughs

under that regulation?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the non-lockable bins and troughs:

are really a very narrow category of situations.

apartment buildings where there is frequently a line of boxes,

one for each individual apartment, where letters are received.

But if the carrier brings larger parcels that won't fit into

5

the box, then they are frequently deposited in a trough or occa­

QUESTION:

Therefore, I take it, a civic association

that drops a leaflet on that trough or table doesn't violate

the statute?
MR, KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

That's correct.

And

14

there was testimony in the record in this case, in fact, that
15

several civic associations had left leaflets on the trough or

I believe that a person may go into almost

any hardware store and buy a metal box which has imprinted on

it in some way, usually by relief, "U.S, Mail."

Now, are those

— I seem to recall, they have some indication that they are
21

approved by the Postal Service?
22

MR, KNEEDLER:

Right.

The Postal Service in its

23

domestic mail manual which contains the regulations for these
24

and a number of other functions of the Service, provides

MR. KNEEDLER:

But

this

statute doesn't apply to those?

Excuse me?

This statute doesn't apply to those?
Yes,, it does.

It anplies to any mail­

box which is either put up by the Postal Service or any letter
box that is furnished by the individual postal customer to
receive the mail.
QUESTION:

11

Even though it's not locked?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Even though it's not locked.

That's

12

13

correct.
QUESTION:

Well, what's the reason for that?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the reports on the statute when

15

it was enacted in 1934 — that's when it was adopted — specify
16

several reasons.

One was the protection of the mail revenue.

17

What was happening in the 1930s is that a number of business
18

concerns were delivering their own bills or circulars, that
19

type of thing, which they were authorized to do under the pri­
20

vate express statutes.

Those statutes permit a person to carry

21
his own mail to a home, and what happened is these companies
22

were having their circulars and bills delivered to premises
23

outside of the mails, but they were using the letter box that
24

had been established or erected on mail routes for the receipt
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

of the U.S. mail, and Congress determined that this practice

2

of delivering things outside of the mail, yet using the mailbox,

3

was depriving the Postal Service of revenue.

The statute does not extend to mail

What would the difference

be?

Well, I'm asking, what' would' the‘difference

You could put anything you want in the slot, but you

couldn't put anything in the --

What is the reason for

singling out the box as compared to the slot?
MR. KNEEDLER:

14

Well, I think one practical difference

is that there is really no receptacle, no equivalent of a
15
mailbox when something is put through the slot.

It just goes

16
into the home.
17
QUESTION:

The receptacle is the home.

18
MR. KNEEDLER:

That's right.

The receptacle is the

19
whole home and I think the -20
QUESTION:

The slot is just an aperture in the door,

21
isn't it?

22
MR.

KNEEDLER:

Yes, exactly.

And there is a recogni­

owner getting other things through the mail.

QUESTION:

Isn't there another factor?

It happens

that my mailbox is some distance from my house.

mail is placed in the box in the morning before the mailman

You can't do that with a mail slot.

QUESTION:

Would not the revenue protection rationale

apply equally to the door slots?
MR. KNEEDLER:

It could conceivably but this statute

has to be considered against, for this purpose, the private
express statutes which have

■ Traditionally the 'Postal Service

has had a monopoly in the areas where it operates since the
19

1790s, but these private express statutes allow other persons,
20

as I mentioned, to deliver their own mail, and the carrier can

1

protection claim in this case, do we?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, we don't.

And there's another fac­

3

tor I would like to mention, though, and that is that, as I men­

4

tioned, the domestic mail manual requires the customer to fur­

5

nish a letter box as a condition to receiving the mail, and as

6

a result of that acceptance of the letter box by the Postal

7

Service, that letter box in effect becomes part of the postal

8

delivery system.

9

both the sender and recipient of mail benefit from federal crim­

10

11
12

inal statutes which bar a person from destroying a letter box
that is on the outside of the house or by the curb and also from
tampering with the mail that is inside such a letter box.
QUESTION:

13
14

For example, as a result of that acceptance

I gather.

Now, there's one other thing, Mr. Kneedler,

This statute is violated only when the deposit is of

mailable matter?

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Without having stamped it?

ME. KNEEDLER:

Without --

QUESTION:

Which I gather would not include porno­

graphic material, for example?

That's not mailable matter, is

20

it?
21

QUESTION:

Or explosives, or snakes.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I would think on — perhaps on

23

a literal reading of the statute.

I'm not aware that the statute

24

has come up, or has been applied in that fashion.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, if it's mailed it would not be.

Is the recipient of this illegal mail guil­

tell them.

MR. KNEEDLER:

As I mentioned, the statute was enacted

in 1934, but the Postmaster General had adopted regulations
going back as far as 1907 to prohibit the deposit of mailable
matter in postal boxes without the payment of postage.

One of

16

the purposes that I mentioned of the statute has been to raise
17

revenue but there are others.

Another purpose noted by Congress

18

in 1934 when it enacted the statute was to prevent the accumula­
19

tion of clutter in mailboxes.

And this concern is elaborated

20

upon in a statement issued by the Postmaster General in that
21

same year when he adopted a similar prohibition by regulation
22
for city and village routes.
23

The Postmaster General stated that the Post Office
24

Department — this statement, incidentally, is in the appendix

3

that their private mailboxes were being filled with political .

4

advertisements, other advertisements, circulars, bills, and

the Postmaster General noted that this clutter particularly in

urban areas had caused some delay for the letter carriers, and

QUESTION:

The delay is just built in today, isn't it?

MR. KNEEDLER:
QUESTION:

Well, there are --

Still, I mean, it wouldn't matter, would it ?

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I'm talking about the delay in the

letter carrier's making his rounds.

There was testimony at

15

trial in this case that if a letter carrier had to come up to a
16

box and it's filled with circulars and other items that have
17

been deposited by others, the letter carrier could not simply
18

deposit the incoming mail into the mailbox.

He would have to

19

withdraw the other materials, sort through them, and see if per­
20

haps some of them had been left by the postal customer to be
21

taken away, and also sort through them to see whether there
22
might be violations of the private express statute.
23

QUESTION:

Is it fair to infer, Mr. Kneedler, that

24

the clutter problem that gave rise to the statute maybe hasn't

2

clutter after the statute was passed than before?

3

obeying the statute, I suppose is what I’m asking?

4

Does the record tell us whether there's any less

MR. KNEEDLER:

Are people

Well, Volume III of the record in this

5

Court contains dozens of copies of letters sent out by the

6

Postal Service just in the Northeast Region to people who had.

7

deposited materials in postal boxes without the payment of

8

postage on them, and what the Postal Service will typically do

9

rather than prosecuting someone is to demand the payment of

10

11
12
13
14
15

postage on these materials.

There was testimony in the record

that in the overwhelming number of cases the person who had
deposited the materials will comply and pay the postage.

So

that the record does establish a pattern of enforcement.

That’s

not to say that there are not some occasions in which the
statute is perhaps violated, but there’s nothing in the record
to suggest that it is being ignored in a wholesale fashion.

16

QUESTION:

Are there many prosecutions

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

There have — I’m informed that there

18

has just been one attempted prosecution, and as I understand it
19

did not result in a judgment of conviction.
20

QUESTION:

Doesn't anybody move around at election tiir e

QUESTION:

Also, the fact that

Mr. Kneedler, I wasn't familiar with that

part that you called my attention to, about all the requests

10

for paying postage on unmailable matter.

Does the record tell

MR. KNEEDLER:
QUESTION:

No, it does not.

But is it in the millions of dollars?

Or is is a few hundred?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it's more than a few hundred.

As I recall, there's a discussion of a thousand or several thou­
sand in just one postal inspection area.

The difficulty with

18
statistics, though, is that the responsibility for enforcing
19
the prohibition at the first level rests with the postmaster of
20

each post office, and it's frequently done on an informal
21
basis, even a telephone call to the person who deposited the

22
material, and then that person may pay in several dollars, or
23
if it's just several pieces, it may be less than a dollar.

So

Would it be any violation of any federal

statute to take something out of that bushel basket?
22
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it would not.

And in fact the

23

alternative of furnishing a separate receptacle for the receipt
24

of items other than the mail was one of the alternatives that

In our view this ad hoc balancing approach fails to
give sufficient deference to Congress's judgment regarding the
need for the statute in the generality of cases and it would
also make vulnerable many statutes or regulations of general
applicability adopted by the Postal Service or by Congress to

regulate a mail delivery system of nationwide scope.

I know it was remanded, but I -Yes, and there was a trial. So this case,

this appeal is directly from the district court.

Now, the dis­

Amendment rights.
aspects.

This assertive infringement could have two

One, that the statute somehow inhibits other alterna­

tive means other than deposit of something in the mailbox, for
communicating.

Or it could be a contention that charging postage

18

for the use of the mailbox itself violates the First Amendment.
19

The district court seems to have believed that because there
20
was testimony for appellees that these other methods of delivery
21

were unsatisfactory, that the statute somehow inhibited or
22

infringed on the appellees' right to deliver materials.
23

QUESTION:

Do you think the district court held that

24

the appellees had a right to have the Post Office Department

carry their circulars free of postage?

•

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mo, it did not,

but

it

did

hold

3

that appellees have a right of access to a part of the postal

4

system, not the entire part, not the delivery part, but to the

5

letter box, which is the terminus or the end of the delivery

process.

7

these appellees have a right of access to that without paying

the established postage.

And as to that, the district court clearly held that

QUESTION:

And the Post Office will carry any of

appellees' circulars if they just pay some postage on it?
MR. KNEEDLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, it will.

Now —

Well, there's no general prohibition

against anybody but a mailman putting anything in the box?
I take it this statute wouldn't be violated if somebody put a
stamp on it and delivered it himself?

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

16

QUESTION:

Because, just because he doesn't trust the

17

Postal Service to get it there.
18

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's right.

Or, one of the justifi­

19

cations appellees advanced below for using, for depositing items
20

in letter boxes free of charge was that if they used the mail
21

the process would be too slow and they couldn't inform residents

of the need to attend meetings that were coming up very quickly.

QUESTION:

So that certainly is no reason

But it does sort of undercut the notion

that one of the reasons for this statute is that it clutters
up the mailbox.

You can clutter it up as much as you want if

you put a stamp on it?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, Mr. Justice White, I don't believe

it does undercut that rationale, because one of the concerns
is that it will increase the cost to the Postal Service if the
letter carrier has to go to the box and sort through materials.
But if the person who deposits something in the letter box

12

pays postage on it, then the Postal Service is being reimbursed
13

to the extent of the postage for the additional effort of the
14

letter carrier going through the box.
15

QUESTION:

But still part of your argument is that he

16

has to sort it out, sort out this stuff that is dropped in.

He

17

has to sort that out from the outgoing mail?
18

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct, but --

19

QUESTION:

That part of it is not — he'd still have

20

to sort out the mail?
21

MR. KNEEDLER:

He still has to do it but the basis

22

of that argument was that this would increase the cost of the
23

mail delivery
24

system.

But to the extent someone puts postage

on the letter, then the Government is being reimbursed for

25
North American Reportinq
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

22

1

that extra effort.

2

garding the asserted infringement on First Amendment rights.

3

And that is that the other alternatives that are available to

4

appellees, such as placing circulars on doorknobs, or behind a

5

screen door, or knocking on the door and handing a circular

6

directly to the customer or to the resident, these other al­

7

ternatives exist whether or not the resident erects a mailbox.

8

And therefore the erection of the mailbox and the Postal Ser­

13
14
15
16
17

I did want to make one point, though, re­

mail has absolutely no effect on all the other alternatives
that are open to an individual for the delivery of messages.
So the erection of a mailbox cannot be said in any respect to
infringe upon the appellees' First Amendment rights.

So the

claim would have to be reduced to the assertion that appellees
have a right of access to the mailbox itself irrespective of
how available other alternatives may be to them.

It's a claim

that they have a right of access to the mailbox itself, and this
Court has never held that Congress cannot establish reasonable

18

postage fees for the use of facilities related to the mail.
19

The Postal Service has existed as long as the First
20

Amendment in this country and has charged postage for the use
21

of the mails, and it is too late in the day in our view to sug­
22
gest that significant First Amendment questions are raised when

Congress establishes a rate classification system for the use

We believe that there are significant First Amendment
issues presented by this case.
QUESTION:

Do you think you have a First Amendment

right to — does anyone have a First Amendment right to walk
into a private property and open the door and put something be­
hind the screen door?
MR. HAMMER:

We don't believe, Mr. Chief Justice,

that the rights that we seek to assert permit us to invade any­
15

body's sacred rights of privacy.

I believe that the decision

16

of this Court in Rowan indicates that the homeowner may make
17

that decision.

There are local law devices such as no trespas­

18

sing signs and things of that nature whereby the homeowner can
19

preclude any type of distribution.

QUESTION:

Must the homeowner put a no trespassing

issues if the Court sees fit.

10
11
12
13
14
15

And I would like to allude to

that briefly.
My adversary indicated in referring to 1725, the
various provisions of the statute;

but he did not refer to

the fact that it requires an intent to avoid the payment of
the postage, an intent, a criminal statute requiring intent.
The companion section of this chapter, 18 USC 1696, provides
an exemption to the private express statute which permits an

16

uncompensated individual to deliver mail.
17

QUESTION:

Where is that in the appendix?

18

MR. HAMMER:

The statute is 18 USC, Section 1696.

19

I believe it's quoted in the brief of the amici, of the Civil
20
Liberties Union, at page 21, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
21

QUESTION:

What color?

22
MR. HAMMER:

That's green.

And I believe that that

23

section provides that in effect a noncompensated volunteer
24

may deliver postage, may deliver matter. If that is the case,

It is, Mr. Justice Brennan.

It’s the same chapter.

MR. HAMMER:

5

Well, Mr. Justice, I believe that what

6

we have tried to do in this action, even though we could not

7

bring a class action for logistical purposes — the problems

8

were too great, that the testimony of the civic representatives

9

who testified in this case were not simply from Sawmill Valley

10

11

or from Greenburgh.

They were from other areas, Connecticut,

New Jersey, White Plains, Queens -QUESTION:

12

MR. HAMMER:

13

All over the country.
Yes.

And in addition, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, on the prior court of appeals proceeding, which was
14
remanded back, Mr. Justice Stevens, as you point out, there
15
were affidavits submitted in that case from civic representa­
16
tives in New Hampshire and in Colorado who testified, this is
17
the common procedure, the way it is pursued throughout the

obtained testimony from representative groups of civic associa­

12

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that someone who is

13

not paid for violating a statute doesn't violate it?
14

MR. HAMMER:

Because the private express statute

exemptions state that a person may deliver if he receives no

And if he receives no compensation, and if he

may thereby deliver, how under the section which is before the

And I would have two

One is a statutory con­

I think that the provisions of this statute

which refer to circulars, statements of account, and sale bills,
and the legislative history confirms this, indicate

that this

statute was intended in 1934 to cover only commercial material,
not noncommercial material.

I think the plain language of the

19

statute indicates that.

And this Court could determine this

20

issue without regard to the questions of commercial distribu­
21

tions.

That's one answer, Mr. Chief Justice.

The second

answer is that I think that this Court in the cases last term,

Amendment right and I believe that the trend of the decisions

in this Court confirms that, there is still a greater degree of

3

protection necessarily afforded to noncommercial distributions:

the political, civic, and public interest material which we seek

5

to distribute, which the amici seek to distribute, and which

all the representative civic groups throughout the United States

seek to distribute.

there are several answers to that.

If a person can deposit, or

distribute as a volunteer under 1696, regardless of how ambigu­
ous that statute may be, then there cannot be any concern for
loss of revenue.
In the second case, and in answer to your question,

14

Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe that there has been wholesale
15

violation of this statute for many years.

We don't claim any

16

invidious discriminatory nonenforcement, but the trial judge
17

took judicial notice of the fact that this statute appears to
18

be more honored in the breach than in the enforcement

since

19

its enactment in 1934.

And if that be the case, then I think

20

there is very little possibility of any revenue or adverse

revenue -22

Brennan, that it should be commercial only.

MR. HAMMER:

Rehnquist, we have to look

questions can be considered by the district court.

correct?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESQ.,
15

OR BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT -- REBUTTAL
16

MR. KNEEDLER:

I'd like to make several points.

One,

17

earlier when I was questioned about the criminal statutes pro­
18

hibiting the taking of materials out of a letter box, I looked
19

back at 1.8 United States Code 1702 and 1708 , which both refer
20

to the taking of a letter from an authorized receptacle without
21

regard to whether that letter was sent through the mail.

So,

22
according to the terms of these statutes, it would appear that
23

even appellees' materials once placed in a letter box would
24

then, if they had placed postage on them, would then be protectejd

MR. KNEEDLER:

10

11
12

14
15

carried

It just says, "letter, postal card', or
i

package," without qualification.

But also, with respect to the

argument based on the private express statutes, 18 United States
Code 1694 and 1696, I think it's important to keep in mind that
Section 1725, which was involved here, was enacted against
the background of private utility companies who were relying on
the private express statutes to carry or transmit their own

16

materials outside of the mail.

And yet Congress enacted this

17

statute to prohibit those companies from using a facility of the
18

mail, in this case, the letter box, to effectuate the delivery
19

of the materials they had carried.

So, as a matter of statutory

20

construction, there's, I think, simply no room for the argument
21

that letters that are delivered to a home under the private
22

/

express statutes are somehow exempt from the prohibition of
23

1725.

That would be directly contrary —

24

QUESTION:

Well, that question hasn't been briefed

and is brought up here for the first time in oral argument.

It was never considered by the district court or the court of

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Justice Stewart, that was Footnote

7

10
11

our jurisdictional statement, and there the
Now, this was in

to the court of appeals.
One last point I would like to make is that our argu­
ment regarding the validity of the statute does not depend on
factual showings in the district court regarding the adequacy
of alternatives.

In fact, we believe the district court pro­

12
13

perly dismissed the complaint the first time around.

And that

is because the effectiveness of the alternative means of
14

delivery that appellees have is totally unaffected by the
15

presence or absence of a mailbox.

Congress is not obligated by

16

the First Amendment to provide a postal service or mailboxes
17

and in the absence, if Congress declined to do so, there could
18

be no First Amendment argument that Congress was somehow re­
19

quired to furnish postal boxes for the delivery of mail.

And

20

since the mere placement of a postal box on a residence does not
21

change the effectiveness of the available alternatives.
