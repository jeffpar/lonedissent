PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2

We'll hear arguments first

3

this morning in Robbins v. California.

4

may proceed now, whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARSHALL W. KRAUSE, ESO.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. KRAUSE:

7
8

11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Good

morning, and may it please the Court:
This case is not about whether petitioner should go to

9
10

Mr. Krause, I think you

prison for 30 pounds of marijuana.

It's about my right to carry

my private papers without government search even though I choose
not to carry them in luggage or briefcase, even though I choose,

12

for instance, to carry them in a heavy paper folder, which I
13
normally do when I go to court on behalf on clients -14
QUESTION:

Do you ordinarily carry them in a plastic

15
sack?
16
MR. KRAUSE:

I don't ordinarily carry my papers in a

17
plastic sack.

However, should it be raining and I would want to

18
protect them from the rain, Justice Rehnquist, I would certainly
19
want that option without a policeman coming up and saying, I wan t
20
to see what's inside that sack.
21

QUESTION:

The question here is not how you do It but

22

how Mr. Robbins was doing it and the circumstances under which
23
he was doing it.
24

Isn't that the question before us?

MR. KRAUSE:

That's quite right.

But, of course, that

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

3

1

question has great implications, and Mr. Robbins was doing it

2

in this way.

3

in the luggage compartment of his station wagon.
QUESTION:

first place?

How did he happen to get stopped in the

Let's begin at the beginning with the facts.

MR. KRAUSE:

6

7

He had some packages, oblong packages, which were

He happened to get stopped because a

policeman named Officer DePue thought that he was driving erra­
tically, that he had crossed the center line, dotted center line
of a highway, and so pulled him over for investigation.

And as

soon as he pulled him over for investigation petitioner Robbins
got out of the car and showed him his driver's license and
Officer DePue then asked for his registration, which Mr. Robbins

2

had in, I believe, the glove compartment of his automobile.

So

3

he opened the door and went back into his car.

Officer DePue

4

followed him and smelled marijuana, the strong pungent odor of
5

marijuana which was coming from the passenger compartment of the
6

car.

He then very soon placed Mr. Robbins under arrest for

7

driving under the influence of marijuana, a charge, by the way,
8

which he was later acquitted on.
9

After Mr. Robbins was placed under arrest, he was put
20

outside of his own car, spread-eagled right above his exhaust
21

pipe, and where he had to inhale the fumes of the exhaust, and
22

soon was overcome by these exhaust fumes, became badly ill, and
23

collapsed on the road.
24

QUESTION:

Is that established in the record, that it

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

4

1

was the exhaust fume that caused this illness?
MR. KRAUSE:

2

I believe it is established that he was

3

placed right at the left rear of the car where the exhaust came

4

out.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. KRAUSE:

7

The motor was running?
The motor was running. That is definitely

in the record, Justice Blackmun.

8

QUESTION:

9

that it was due to the fumes?
MR. KRAUSE:

10

11
12

I suppose you're just drawing a conclusion

Well, I think this was a conclusion from

the fact that the motor was running and that he was spreadeagled right over the exhaust.
QUESTION:

13
14

Yes.

Well, is this important to your position in

anyway?
MR. KRAUSE:

It would only be important if we were

15

worried about probable cause, which -16

QUESTION:

Well, there's no question of probable cause

17

to arrest, was there?
18

MR. KRAUSE:

Well, there's no question of probable

19

cause to arrest, no, but there is some question of probable
20

cause to search, which in all frankness is not presented in our
21

petition,, so it's not that significant. What is significant is
22

that soon Mr. Robbins found himself handcuffed and in the back
23

of the patrol car, and the police started searching his car.
24

Now, this is, of course, without a warrant at all.

about that?

Would he have drawn any inferences

Would he be entitled to draw any inferences that

the erratic.driving of the car might have been related to the
missing part of the whiskey in the bottle?

12

MR. KRAUSE:

drawn from such a discovery, Justice -14
QUESTION:

Well, if he smelled the marijuana and found

15
a cigarette, could he draw any inferences that the marijuana

smoking might have contributed to the -- ?
17
MR. KRAUSE:

Yes, sir. That's why he was perfectly

18
justified in arresting Mr. Robbins

for

driving under the influ­

19
ence of marijuana.

No question about it.

20

QUESTION:

In this case, as I understand it, we assume

21

there was probable cause for the search.

But the issue is whe­

22

ther or not a warrant was required?
23
MR. KRAUSE:

That's the issue.

And I want to describe

24
the way in which the 30 pounds of marijuana came to the attentio n
25
North American Heportinq
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

6

1

of the officers, because that's the only issue really before

2

this Court.

3

is not really before this Court in my opinion, because the

4

Attorney General did not cross-petition for certiorari and that

5

cookie tin marijuana formed the basis of an entirely separate

6

charge, possession of marijuana, which was dismissed, which was

7

ordered dismissed by the court of appeal in California because

8

in that court the Attorney General conceded that the cookie tin

9

was covered by Sanders and also the tote bag,

10
11
12
13
14
15

I might say that what was found in the cookie tin

there was a can­

vas tote bag that contained a little more marijuana. Finally,
after the police officer unlocked the back door of the station
wagon with the petitioner's keys, opened up the luggage compart­
ment and went through a briefcase and the tote bag, he came
across two securely wrapped plastic packages.
plastic packages.

They were opaque

No one could see inside those packages to

determine what they contained.

There is no issue about that;

16

they were opaque.
17

QUESTION:

How did he happen to go into the trunk?

18

MR. KRAUSE:

He was making basically a general explora

19

tory search.
20

QUESTION:

Well, what I'm driving at is, did not your

21

client say to him, what you're looking for is in the back?
22

MR. KRAUSE:

Yes.

He said that after the cookie tin

23

had been entered and after it was obvious that the police offi­
24

cers were making a general exploratory search.

Now, that goes

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

7

1

to the issue of probable cause.

2

officer's probable cause?

3

raise that issue in our petition for certiorari, so really the

4

warrant question is the only one that is fully before this Court

5

although we do not concede that there was probable cause to go

6

into the trunk in the first place, but we didn't want to bring

7

that up precisely because we weren't sure that that would be an

8

11

And as I've said, we didn't really

issue that you would be interested in at this time.
QUESTION:

9
10

Does that add to the police

Let's focus on that warrant now for a

minute.
MR. KRAUSE:
QUESTION:

All right.
I have a question to put to you.

You have

12
13

conceded that if the policeman saw what appeared to be a bottle
and on retrieving the bottle found that it was half consumed or

14

half filled, what about -- is that in plain view?
15

MR. KRAUSE:

If the bottle is in a paper bag it pre­

16

sents the difficult question which was just handled by the
17

Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in United States v. Ross
18

in that en banc decision that was handed down March 31.
19

QUESTION:

But that wasn't a bottle of whiskey, was it ?

20

MR. KRAUSE.

No. That was, I think, some sort of

21

controlled substance that was in the bag.

I think my answer to

22

the paper bag having a half-consumed bottle of whiskey is that
23

this would truly be one of those question that depended on the
24

individual facts and the testimony.

If the policeman testified

25
North American Heportinq
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

that he could smell whiskey, had picked up the bag and it felt

2

like a bottle of whiskey to him, that it was on the floor of

3

the car and he thought it was trash, all of those things, I

4

think, would add to the factual issue and on the basis of those

5

facts you would, some judge would make the decision as to whe­

6

ther a warrant was required.

7

In this case, I would say we have considerably stronge r

8

and better facts for requiring a warrant.

9

we have a sealed opaque package.

We have a package,

We have a package which we be­

10

lieve qualifies, under the Jackson case, which Chief Justice

11

Burger cited and relied upon in Chadwick. And the Jackson case,

12
13
14
15
16
17

of course, involves a package, a package in the mail, but this
Court said in Jackson that packages in the mail are protected
in the same manner as if the individual still had control of
them before putting them into the mail.

So I don't think that

the Jackson case is specifically a mail case.

The Jackson

case Is a package case, and it's very clear from the Jackson
case that Justice Field who wrote the case and the other jus­

18

tices on the Court at that time were clear that packages were
19

protected by the warrant clause back in the 19th century.
20

QUESTION:

Yet, if the defendant in this case had been

21

arrested on probable cause and searched pursuant to a custodial
22

arrest, there's no question that a package on his person could
23

have been searched, is there?
24

MR. KRAUSE:

Yes, Justice Rehnquist, I would question

25

North American Reporting

1

that.

2

package, unless there's some emergency I see no reason why pro­

3

bable cause for that package should not be presented to a magis­

4

trate .

5

7

If a person is validly arrested and is carrying a sealed

QUESTION:

How do you distinguish the Robinson case

and the Gustafson case?
MR. KRAUSE:

Well, I don't think that that case in­

8

volved a sealed package.

9

the emergency, once it's clear that the package has been taken

10

11
12
13
14

I would say that

once you get rid of

away from the arrested person so he can no longer present any
threat to the police officers, then I believe that that package
should be taken down to the station.

If I'm wrong on that it

still doesn't make any difference for our case, Justice Rehnquist, because there's never been any contention that this was
a search incident to an arrest, in the Robbins case.

Nor has

15

there every been any contention that this was a consented search
16

QUESTION:

No, but there has to be some sort of line

17

somewhere which police officers and ordinary citizens and magis­
18

trates can operate under without having it fluctuate, based on
19

the facts of each case.
20

MR. KRAUSE:

Yes, and I think that I would like to

21

suggest such a line, and we have suggested such a line.

That

22

is that where there is no emergency or no consent or other
23

waiver, that if a person, if a policeman has probable cause as
24

to a package or takes it into his custody incident to an arrest
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

10

1

that the warrant rule should apply, because this Court for well

2

over 100 years has said that the warrant is the rule.

3

less there is an exception found there must be a warrant.

4

Court has said many, many times that no amount of probable cause

5

will serve as a substitute for a warrant.

6

Rehnquist, that that is the easy line that can be applied by

7

the officer in the field, that if there is an opaque package

8

9

10
11
12
13
14

And un­
The

And I think, Justice

that he can't see, take it to a magistrate, get permission to
open it, make sure that your arrest will stick.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you do in the meantime if

you're by yourself, as a' law enforcement officer?
MR. KRAUSE:

You're going to put the person you ar­

rested in your patrol car and you also put the package in the
patrol car, Justice Rehnquist.

I think that it certainly

couldn't be considered to be a burden on the officer to take,
15

for instance, the two packages in this case and put them in his
16

patrol car.

He was going to take the defendant, the arrested

17

defendant in to the station anyway.

He wasn't going anywhere.

18

He had a second officer with him.

There was absolutely no bur­

19

den or inconvenience.

It would have been good law enforcement

20

for that officer to do that.

It would have validated his arrest

21

instead of bringing it before the Supreme Court of the United
22

States, as it is now.
23

QUESTION:

What if they had three heavy suitcases?

24

MR. KRAUSE:

We thought about that, Justice Stevens.

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

11

1

What if the suitcases are like the trunk in Chadwick that's so

2

huge that it can't be moved?

3

QUESTION:

And there are, you know, there are four or

4

five of them, it would be rather bulky to stick in the back of

5

the -MR. KRAUSE:

6

Yes, if there is that problem, then I

7

think that we have the same kind of a situation as is present

8

under Chambers for an automobile search.

9

the automobile search exception has, I think that same exception

0

11
2
3
4

And to whatever force

should apply to packages or piano cases or safes or suitcases
that are too heavy to move.

I think that the officer should

have some attention paid to him.

If he tells the court, the

trial court, that, yes, he realized that he perhaps could have
lifted up this suitcase but it was too heavy and too bulky to put
in his car and it would have caused him some inconvenience, I

5

don't think that there's a court in the country that wouldn't
6

give credence to that kind of a judgment.

Because it's an offi­

7

cer in the field.
8

This is not that kind of a case.

This is a simple

9

case.

This is a case of a constable's blunder, and now both

20
the state government and the federal government are trying to
2

erode the Fourth Amendment to protect this simple arrest that
22

should have been handled in the first place.
23

QUESTION:

Suppose an officer has concededly probable

24

cause to believe that someone either walking on the street or
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

12

1

driving in an automobile has illegal drugs in a plastic bag,

2

an opaque plastic bag, and everybody concedes that there was

3

perfectly good reason to believe that he was carrying such drugs

4

in a plastic bag.

5

plastic bag, or he stops the car on probable cause and he sees

6

7

that there's a plastic bag there.

Now, I take it you agree he

can arrest the man?
MR. KRAUSE:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

And the officer seized the man, he has the

Yes, sir.
He can arrest the man based on the proba­

ble cause that he is carrying drugs?
MR. KRAUSE:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.
But he may not open the bag?

12

MR. KRAUSE:

He may not open the bag.

13

QUESTION:

He has to -- it may be that if he opened

14

it and found that it didn't have drugs in it he could let him

MR. KRAUSE:

That's the same issue that was discussed

17

by Justice Powell in this Arkansas v. Sanders.
18

QUESTION:

Right, right.

19

MR. KRAUSE:

And he said, if — and I think Chief

20

Justice Burger said this, too — if the man under arrest feels
21

that he wants to surrender his right of privacy he can do that

22

at any time and say, look in my bag.
23
24

QUESTION:

So you say to the man, I'm either going to

13

What about the statement, "What you are

9

That gives our citi­

Do you have any comment about what

I don't know.

I know that the petitioner

had collapsed on the street and had vomited and was very ill at
the time and I don't know what it meant.

Certainly, there

could be some very strong inferences drawn, and if the state
had argued that that was a consent, then perhaps we would have
a more difficult case.

But the state has never argued that that

14

is a consent.

And that leads me to believe that even the state

15

concedes that the statement was involuntary because the man had
16

just been rendered unconscious by being forced to inhale his own
17

exhaust.
18

QUESTION:

Well, now, you have said that several times

19

Is there anything in this record that says he was unconscious
20

because he inhaled exhaust or because he inhaled marijuana?
21

MR. KRAUSE:

All I can is that he seemed to be func­

22

tioning before he had to stand over his exhaust pipe.
23

QUESTION:

Mr. Krause, you don't challenge the open­

ing of the trunk itself, do you?

3

Arguendo, by assumption, by hypothesis,

everything that happened up until the search of this particular
container, you don't question?
MR. KRAUSE:

4

No, not legally.

I would like to also

point out that there are a couple of other important cases that
5

apply the Warrant Clause to packages.

One of them is the Walter

6

case as to which there may not have been a clear majority opinion
7

but it seems that five justices did join in those parts that say
8

that those cardboard cartons that contain the allegedly obscene
9

films were protected by the Warrant Clause, and then there's the
20

van Leeuwen case involving some boxes in the mail.
2

I would also like to say that the Warrant Clause seems
22
to me to be extremely important for another reason mentioned by
23

Chief Justice Burger in Chadwick, and that is the separation of
24

powers.
25

The big problem with the writs of assistance was that

they were executive warrants in England.
North American Reporting

They were Issued by an

1

executive officer to be enforced by an executive officer and I

2

think that the separation of powers concept is extremely impor­

3

tant, that wherever possible we want a representative of the ju­

4

diciary to pass upon whether our privacy should be violated,

5

not a policeman acting on the street.
And I say, "wherever possible," because those are the

have a situation where it's not possible, where there's an
emergency, where there's a waiver, where there's a problem,
then let the police officer do his duty.

But I say, Justices,

that there is no such situation in this case.
In this case you had a situation of a very simple fact

of putting two packages or maybe three packages in the back of
a patrol car with the defendant.

14

I would like to get a little bit to Footnote 13 of
15

the Arkansas v. Sanders case.

That seems to be an unlucky

16

footnote, because although the Court below relied upon it, the
17

Solicitor General does not rely upon it and the Attorney General
18

of California merely makes the barest passing reference to Foot­
19

note 13.
20

Footnote 13, it seems to me, has two meanings. One is,
21

where there is something in plain view -- and there was nothing
22

in plain view in this case.

There is no testimony about plain

23

smell or plain feel or anything.

The officer just said, he saw

24

these opaque plastic packages and he opened them.
25
North American Heportinq

whatsoever about the officer could tell what the contents are.

way does not add to any plain view showing.
Then there's the part of Footnote 13 that says, where

12

That was never put forth as a

the contents can be inferred from the very container, that can­
not support a reasonable expectation of privacy.

And Justice

Powell gave us two examples, a gun case and a kit of burglar
tools.

QUESTION:

I suppose a bottle with some brown liquid

16

in would be something like that too, wouldn't it?
17

MR. KRAUSE:

Yes, if you had a whiskey bottle, its

18

contents could be inferred from its outside appearance.

In our

QUESTION:

But preceding that you had the odor of

marijuana identified by the officer and the marijuana cigarette.
22
MR. KRAUSE:

Yes.

In the front part of the car.

But

23

nothing, no odor at all from the rear luggage compartment, which
24

was entirely separate.

It's a station wagon and the testimony

explain that, if you choose to carry something in something

I don't think you should expect that that container

would not be inspected.

You have identified, you have invited,

you have waived by that kind of a container.

Contrast that with

the footlocker in Chadwick where we had leaking talcum powder
15

which the experts who had looked at it said was a sure sign of
16

marijuana, and we had a dog who smelled that and said, in
17

his own inimitable language, there's marijuana in this foot­
18

locker.

Still, that was not self-identifying, Your Honors.

19

A warrant was required, a warrant was required because it was
20

closed, it was opaque, and the contents could not be viewed.
21

I would say the same thing is true in this case.
22

I think, relevant to Footnote 13, also, is that
23

petitioner had protected his privacy very carefully by the way
24

he packaged the containers and where he put them, and I think

yes.

And you just -- you could have a hunch,

We assume it.

11

And I might point out that anything could be packed

We assume that there's probable cause;

Right.
QUESTION:

The question is, whether or not a warrant

12

was required.

That's the only issue before us, isn't it?

MR. KRAUSE:

Yes, and, of course, we rely on no amount

14

of probable cause standing alone can justify a warrantless
15

search absent waiver of emergency, Coolidge v. New Hampshire,
16

and many, many other cases.
17

QUESTION:

You're assuming, I gather, then, that if

18

this same package had been carried as he walked down the street,
19

under his arm, without being in any other larger container,
20

there would have been probable cause to arrest him for posses­

sion of marijuana?

If you're assuming probable causes for pur­

1

Well, you did awhile ago.

I asked you

2

exactly the same question and you said, yes, there would be

probable cause to arrest him even if you couldn't open the

HR. KRAUSE:

No, I think your question assumed, Jus­

cause for arrest.

MR. KRAUSE:

10

11

Oh, yes.
And I think Justice Stevens -Well, I asked you if there was probable

cause to arrest, because there was probable cause to believe
that he was carrying drugs in an opaque sack?

12

MR. KRAUSE:

Oh, well, then I completely misunderstood

13

your question.

I thought --

14

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't there be probable -- oh, ex­

15

cuse me; you can go ahead with Justice Stevens.

MR. KRAUSE:

That's all right.

I think both —

QUESTION:

I think you've already answered the ques­

tion .
19

MR. KRAUSE:

Both can be answered at the same time,

20

because merely carrying a plastic-wrapped package is not pro­
21

22
23

bable cause that that package contains contraband.
QUESTION:

Well, ho-, but I said that — I asked you

that, suppose that anybody would agree that the officer.had

Well, apart from this particular package

which apparently some officers would consider probably to con­
tain marijuana.
MR. KRAUSE:

Right.

12

QUESTION:

The reason I ask you is, I'm wondering if

13

he could get a warrant.

Do you assume or do you not assume

14

that if they took the package out of the trunk and brought it
15

in and set in on the magistrate's desk and said, I'd like a war­
16

rant to open this, what would the magistrate do?
17

MR. KRAUSE:

I think the magistrate would turn down

18

the warrant unless the additional facts were presented to him
19

that also this man was smoking a joint of marijuana, a cigarette
20

that smelled to me like marijuana, and here it is, and I can
21

identify it as marijuana.

Once you have connected the possessor

22

of the package with other marijuana, I think your probable cause
23

for the package increases.

I'm not prepared to --

QUESTION:

Would it be probable cause if it weren't in

But standing alone, no.

And standing alone, a man walking down the street
carrying Mr. Robbins' two plastic-wrapped packages, it would be

5

outrageous to consider that a magistrate would issue a warrant
6

for the search of that.
7

QUESTION:

Then, I take It, the magistrate should not

8

have issued a warrant for the cookie tin or

the tote bag either

9

if they'd been brought in?
20

MR. KRAUSE:

If it weren't for the odor of marijuana,

2

I would say the probable cause would be zero.

But unfortunately

22

for petitioner, there was the odor of marijuana and what appear­
23

ed to be marijuana cigarettes.
24

QUESTION:

See, this thing I'm trying to think through

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

is whether the issue here is whether a warrant is necessary or

whether a search can take place.

6

tion of privacy has come up a lot and I think that's an extreme­

7

ly important area for this Court because too many people assume

8

that you want the policeman on the street to make some judgment

as to a legitimate or a reasonable expectation of privacy.

Well, the issue as we presented it is

the way in which you determine whether there has been a search
or whether the person complaining about the search has the stand­
ing to complain about it.
QUESTION:

15

What kind of judgments must the policeman

on the beat make before he makes a Terry type of search?

MR. KRAUSE:

I think that he has a lot of leeway there

17

and I think his -18

QUESTION:

Now,

all of the factors 'are subjective,

19

are they?

Or are some objective and some subjective?

20

MR. KRAUSE:

I think there are certainly some objec­

tive facts and in the particular case you had to have individ­
22

uals acting suspiciously, walking up and down in front of a
23

store, as if they were going to rob the store. And the police­
24

man -- maybe an ordinary citizen might not have thought too

much about that, but the policeman can use his expert knowledge

and can infer that something's going on.

So I think it

But, once again, justified.

In a Terry search, could he enter any

package that might contain a gun?
MR. KRAUSE:

No, sir, I don't believe so, unless the

suspect could get to it.

If he had a sealed package, for

instance, it's highly unlikely that he could unseal the package
1

before the policeman could do something about it,

I would say, if he

13

was carrying an open shopping bag

that he could reach in and

14

pull out a weapon from, and the policeman had good facts from
15

which he could say that there might be a danger to himself if
16

he detained this man and questioned him about his suspicious
17

activities without first protecting himself, I would say that
18

he would have a right to pat down that shopping bag to make
19

sure that there wasn't an easily reachable gun in it.
20
The last thing I want to say before I sit down and
1

reserve the rest of my time is that the legitimate expectation
22

of privacy, when you analyze it carefully, has nothing whatso­
3

ever to do with the Warrant Clause.
4

It is entirely independent.

The Warrant Clause depends on entirely different considerations

mainly dealing with the exigencies of the situation.

2

mate expectation of privacy deals with the person's ability to

3

come to this Court or any other court and say, my privacy has

been invaded, my Fourth Amendment rights have been taken away

5

from me.
That is the confusion that the respondents have en­

They have tried to confuse this Court to say that

legitimate expectation of privacy has something to do with,
number one, the Warrant Clause, and number two, the policeman's
decisions on the street.
QUESTION:

11

Well, I don't quite follow you as to the

confusion that you say has been generated.

Doesn't the legiti­

2

mate expectation of privacy govern as to whether or not your
3

materials, or your possessions are protected from seizure by the
4

police?

MR. KRAUSE:

That is not the test that the policeman

6

should use.
7

Isn't that

8

what it adds up to?

MR. KRAUSE:

That's the test that the Court used, but

that's not the test the policeman should use.

If it's not in

North American Reporting

Well, but in Rakas we held that it was not

MR. KRAUSE:

8

It's a standing question.

It's quite true, but it's not the kind

of test that you anticipate a policeman to use on the street.
The test that you want a policeman to use on the street is whe­
ther there is some exception, whether there's plain view or
whether there's consent.

If not, when he's dealing with a

sealed package, he should take it to a magistrate.

He should --

in your view?

anything to do with that test.

I would say the courts should

That is the test for courts to follow, not for the

20

policeman on the field.

And that's where the respondents have

2

confused the issue.

They have asked the policeman on the field

22

to make a judgment on reasonable expectation of privacy.

They

have asked the policeman on the field to look at my folder here

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

11

14

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD E. NIVER, ESQ.,

10

13

That's exactly what

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The search in this case, a roadside search of an auto­
mobile early in the morning, based on probable cause to believe
that the car and its contents contained marijuana, occurred
6-1/2 years ago.

At the time of the search California and

federal law was clear, it was unanimous, that probable cause to
18

search an automobile for evidence of crime gave to the searching
19

officer the justification to search containers for the same evi­
20

dence of crime.

It was in reasonable reliance upon this rule,

21

this California and federal rule, that the warrantless search
22

took place.

And it's for this reason alone that the judgment

23

of the lower court should be affirmed.

The officer reasonably

24

relied on the law in existence at the time, in conducting the
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

27

1

search.

2

search took place in 1981, we believe that the search was still

3

lawful.

4

Court in Chadwick and Sanders announced a per se rule that all

5

containers, all opaque containers, may not be searched without

6

a warrant.

7

not see into any of the containers, petitioner concludes that he

8

should have gotten a warrant and his failure to do so requires

9

the suppression of the evidence.

12
13
14
15

Petitioner has contended otherwise, arguing that

this

In this case, of course, since the officer could

We read the case as not to go nearly as far as peti­

10
11

But even if the search took place today, even if the

tioner.

In Arkansas v. Sanders, in this Court's Footnote 13,

the Court said that not all containers and packages found by
police during the course of a search will deserve the full pro­
tection of the Fourth Amendment.

And this Court acknowledged

that it would be difficult to determine which parcels taken from
a car require the issuance of a warrant and which do not.

16

So, the task in this case is to determine which con­
17

tainers are protected by the warrant requirement and which con­
18

tainers may be searched upon probable cause alone.

And at this

19

point it

should be made clear that we are talking by hypothesis

20

about probable cause searches.

California is not arguing that

21

a search of a container may be made without probable cause.
22

Again, by hypothesis, there is probable cause in all search
23

cases.
24

So, then, we have to determine what standard should
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

be employed to decide when a warrant is required and when it is

2

not, and we believe that we should return to the rule in Katz,

3

Katz v. United States, the formulation set down by Mr. Justice

4

Harlan.

5

reasonable expectation of privacy in the container so great

6

that before the governmental intrusion can occur a warrant must

7

be issued.

8

tations of privacy are reasonable?

9

and in Justice Harlan's dissent in United States v. White and

10

11
12

It brings us then to the question, just what expec­

in Rakas v.

And this Court in Katz

Illinois has told us that an expectation of privacy

is reasonable when society deems it to be reasonable, when it is
prepared to accept that expectation as legitimate.
Now, the societal determination is based on the

13
14

And that is, whether the possessor the container has a

customs and values of past and present and the extent to which a
reasonable person's sense of security would be breached by the

15

governmental conduct.

Or, to put the matter even more simply,

16

will the search diminish the amount of freedom and privacy to
17

a level inconsistent with the goals and values of this society?
18

Now, we submit that the answer to this question Is,
19

no, the search in this case would not offend society's sense of
20
security.
21

QUESTION:

Well, is that the sort of test -- harking

22
back to the colloquy that my brother Rehnquist had with your pre
23

decessor here at the podium, is that the sort of test that we can
24

expect an officer on the beat to apply?
25

QUESTION:

Doesn't the officer on the beat, shouldn't

8

he welcome clearcut rules one way or the other?
MR. NIVER:

9

QUESTION:

10

11

Rather than a test that depends upon the

expectations of society and for him to evaluate that?
MR. NIVER:

12
13

He should welcome --

He should welcome a test which is clearcut

but the test must also be faithful to the history and the pur­
poses of the Fourth Amendment.

You have to accommodate both

14

the values that the-'Fourth Amendment was intended to protect;
15

you have to accommodate the interests of the private citizen in
16

a

sense

of security.

17

QUESTION: That' s what courts must do , but what an enforce­
18

ment officer wants and needs, I should suppose, is working rules.
19

MR. NIVER:

That's right.

That's right. And so we

20
first turn to this Court's cases to determine just what are
21

working rules, and we believe that a working rule and a value
22

which is granted a high preference by the society are those re­
23

positories which are intended to contain personal effects.

To protect one's valuables.
Well, that's their personal property,

Isn't it?
14

MR. NIVER:

Yes.

For example, a tool box.

A person

15

puts a lock on his tool box because his tools are expensive, not
16

because he has a privacy interest in the tools.

Most people do

17

not care if other people see their tools.
18

QUESTION: I don' t know howyou draw this line.

I have trou

19

ble along this line of trying to say it's so simple.

I guess the

20

police have to decide what's best for society.

And do you have

21

a course in California teaching police what's best for society?
22

MR. NIVER:

We have training for --

I think that society places a great importance in protecting

QUESTION:

12

Turning to this question, what is the difference

The problem is that what you and I might

carry in a suitcase, people in a different socio-economic strata
carry in a grocery bag.
MR. NIVER:

14

QUESTION:

Perhaps.

Yes.

There is that possibility.

And yet, we're all protected by the Consti­

15

tution .
16

MR. NIVER:

That's right.

I think that the test that

17

we have proposed is that if the officer reasonably believes
18

that a grocery bag is being used as a repository for such con­
19

tents, it may not be searched without a warrant.

But, for

20
example, if the officer saw somebody come out of a grocery store
21

with a grocery bag and also had probable cause to believe that
22

drugs were in the bottom of the grocery bag, he would have no
23

reason to believe that it was that person's suitcase.
24

QUESTION:

If he came out of the grocery store with a

With a little glassine bag inside of it.

MR. NIVER:

8

Even a large brown bag.

I see.

Yes.

He wouldn't have much trouble with it?
No, he wouldn't have any trouble with that

nor would he have any trouble with a larger brown bag into which
he could not see, because, again, there would be no expectation
of privacy so intense as to require a warrant.

Now, it is true

that this is a value choice that we are proposing but we believe
that it's supported by this Court's cases, from Katz through
Rakas, Chadwick, Sanders, and the like.

14

QUESTION:

When we talk

about an expectation of

15

privacy, do we need to distinguish between a legitimate expec­
16

tation of privacy and an expectation in the abstract?

Let me

17

enlarge on that a little.

I suppose, if you've got marijuana

18

in the bag, you certainly have a hope that it's going to be
19

private.

Is that not so?

20

MR. NIVER:

That's true.

21

QUESTION:

Suppose it's a pistol, loaded pistol?

You

22

certainly hope that that is not going to be detected by anyone.
23

The question is, whether

there is a legitimate expectation of

24

privacy if you're carrying a pistol or a piece of contraband,
25

marijuana or opium or cocaine.

2

MR. NIVER:

3

QUESTION:

That's right, sir.
I don't see, I don't recall in your brief

4

that you have undertaken to treat the difference between the

5

legitimate expectation of privacy and a hope, what might be

6

called a hope of privacy.
MR. NIVER:

7

8
9
10

Do you care to'comment on that?

Yes, I think, Your Honor, that we did dis­

cuss the fact that under the Katz expectation of privacy formu­
lation there are two considerations.

First, the discussion is

contained on pages 32 through 37 of the Respondent's brief,
and that is that there is a two-fold requirement, see Mr. Justice

11

Harlan's statement:

first,that a

person have exhibited an

12

actual or subjective expectation of privacy and second, that
13

the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as
14

reasonable.
15

QUESTION:

That was just a concurring opinion in that

16

rule, wasn't it?
17

MR. NIVER:

That's right, but the formulation also

18

appeared in the Court's majority opinion in Rakas v. Illinois.
19

QUESTION:

Tell me, I'm still worried about this pur­

20
pose.

You've got a briefcase with a lock on It, but it's not

21

locked, it's open.

And you've got a package that's wrapped up

22

with sealing wax and tape and all.

The briefcase has more

23

privacy than that package?
24

MR. NIVER:

Probably.

QUESTION:

shape, consistency of a 15-pound block of marijuana.

Now,

though it was not litigated in the trial court, it could not be

it emitted a smell of marijuana.
QUESTION:

Now --

That's in the record?

15

MR. NIVER:

It is not in the record.

It is an infer­

16

ence that we draw from the fact that the marijuana brick weighed
17

15 pounds.

Under these circumstances there is absolutely no

18

reason for the officer to believe that that was any kind of a
19

personal effect other than a marijuana brick.

There was no

20

reason for the officer to believe that this was luggage or that
21

It contained a man's clothing, his papers, or anything remotely
22

similar to personal effects.
23

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that the profile or

24

silhouette of a marijuana block is comparable to the profile or

MR. NIVER:

does not necessarily tell you that it contains liquor.
QUESTION: Well, but you start with the profile and the n
you find that it's got' some brown liquid in it, and then by tak­
ing the cork out you draw some inferences as to what kind of
brown liquid -- you detect the difference between iced tea or
tea, and bourbon.
MR. NIVER:

Oh, I see.

QUESTION: Now, I'm asking whether you're arguing that
the shape of that block, which a policeman understood is the

12

way marijuana is transported, is something like the shape of a
13

bottle that sets him off on the series of deciding whether he
14

can make a search.
15

MR. NIVER:

The shape of the package -- in this case,

16

the shape of the package would certainly tell the officer, toge­
17

ther with the surrounding circumstances, that it was marijuana.
18

That gives him probable cause; there's no question about that.
19

But also, the shape of the marijuana together with what was
20
almost certainly an odor of marijuana would defeat any legiti­
21

mate expectation of privacy in the contents of that bag, of the
22

green plastic bag.

So, yes, Your Honor, there is an analogy to

be drawn between between the shape of the brick and the shape of

a liquor bottle.

QUESTION:

Mr. Niver, this car

was a station wagon,

14

as I understand it.

And I've heard repeated reference by both

15

you and your cocounsel to the trunk of the station wagon.

The

16

station wagons I've been familiar with, and perhaps I'm just not
17

up to date on them, have had decks, and you can get into them
18

by the rear door, by unlocking and raising the door.

But they

19

don't have a trunk the way an ordinary car has.
20

So, getting back to our standard, repository of per­
sonal effects, I think that

this

is

supported by this Court's

cases, the cases which we have enumerated, Cardwell, Chadwick,
15

and Sanders.

And it is also -- although somewhat openended --

16

is nevertheless a rational test, because there is -- it is incon
17

gruous, I would think, to permit an officer to search the trunk
18

of a car or a glove box of a car, but yet if he finds, for
19

example, a cookie tin or a candy box or a soda cup in the trunk,
20

QUESTION:

Does he have to haul those out of the car and haul

Of course it depends on the facts in the

individual case. If it is highly impractical to haul such a

container down to the police station, that might very well be
22

exigent circumstances such as we recognized in Katz.

just simply impossible to haul it anyplace.

2

I suppose, would be to isolate it, be to isolate it on the highway

3

and call for additional help, some sort of a large van. But of

4

course that is not the problem in this case.

5

QUESTION:

The alternative,

Well, instead of one large suitcase, say

6

there are about eight medium-sized suitcases, any one of which

7

would be easy to handle, but you kind of convert a police offi­

11

cer into a bellboy, lugging all this stuff back and forth,
filling up his car.

It’s your view that he would have to do

that, if there's a lot of luggage in the car, and he wanted to
look in any of the suitcases?
MR. NIVER:

It's my view that at that, we have to

12

decide that on the basis of the particular circumstances.

In

13

this case of eight suitcases, perhaps if it could be 'done, if1
14

It could be carried to the police station, then I suppose that
15

that's what he would be required to do.

If it was simply too

16

impractical, too inconvenient to do it, then I would argue that
17

it creates an exigent circumstance.

QUESTION:

You don't ask us to take another look at

24

Arkansas v. Sanders, do you?
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

43

MR. NIVER:

1

I think that Arkansas v. Sanders is cor­

2

rectly decided on its facts, the facts being that luggage may

3

not without exigent circumstances be searched without a warrant.

4

What we are arguing is that luggage does not include every sin­

5

gle opaque package within the memory -- within the ability of man to

6

7
8

9

conceive, that there are certain packages which society has de­
cided are so important, that contain articles of intrinsic
value, intrinsic privacy, that they may not be searched without
a warrant.

In this case we don’t have such packages.
The argument

10

has

been

made

by

counsel

that

such a test which we have proposed is open-ended, is unpredict­
11

able, it would be difficult for a police officer to apply in
12

each individual case.

that can be answered by referenc e

I think

13
to the hypothetical in the dissent in Sanders, at page 772.
14
Mr. Justice Blackmun listed eight containers and asked, would a
15
warrant be required to search these?

And he listed

orange

16
crate, lunch bucket, attache case, duffle bag, cardboard box,
17
backpack, tote bag, and paper bag.

I think that under the test

18
we propose the orange crate and the lunch bucket could be
19
searched without a warrant upon probable cause.

An attache

20
case and a duffle bag could not be.
21

22

A cardboard box probably

could be searched without a warrant, depending on the circum­
stances under which it was found,

A backpack and a tote bag

23
could not be searched, and a paper bag could be searched without
24

a warrant.

Now, again, returning to the facts of this case,

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

44

1

there was absolutely no reason for the officer to believe that

2

this contained anything remotely in the way of personal effects.

3

But returning to the issue which we first raised at

4

the beginning of the argument, retroactivity, I think that it

5

bears repeating that this search occurred 2-1/2 years before

6
7
8

9
10
11

Chadwick and 4-1/2 years before Arkansas v. Sanders.

And apply­

ing the test of Peltier, 422 U.S., unless we are to hold that
parties may not reasonably rely upon any legal pronouncement em­
anating

from sources other than this Court, we cannot regard

as blameworthy those parties who conform their conduct to the
prevailing constitutional or statutory norms.
QUESTION: Well, isn't it accurate that the original

12

decision in this case by the California court was founded upon a
13

theory that was later found to be invalid in Chadwick, and that
14

that decision, that judgment, was set aside by this Court and
15

the case was remanded to the

California court to reconsider the

16

case in the light of Chadwick.

And upon reconsideration, they

17

totally abandoned the theory that since this was found in an
18

automobile it could be searched, and espoused a quite different
19

theory, on which their judgment is now founded.

And therefore,

20

aren't we faced, regardless of the retroactivity, vel non, of
21

Chadwick, aren't we faced now with determining the validity
22

of the foundation upon which the judgment of the California
23

court now rests?
24

MR. NIVER:

No, I don't think so.

of us in Chadwick thought it was an automobile case.

4

That's right.

But if the probable cause had not existed

before the trunk was put in the taxicab, did anything about the
movement from the loading platform to the taxicab add to the
probable cause for arrest?
MR. NIVER:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. NIVER:

In Sanders, you mean?
In Chadwick?
In Chadwick.

I don't believe so.

12

QUESTION:

The character of the material that fur­

13

nished the probable cause existed before any taxicab was even
14

in sight, presumably.

Is that not so?

15

MR. NIVER:

That is a fair statement of the facts of

16

Chadwick, as I recall them.
17

QUESTION:

So, perhaps you should have answered me

18

that we in effect overruled Draper in Chadwick and Sanders?
19

MR. NIVER:

Perhaps so.

20

QUESTION:

But Draper has been cited since then, with

21

approval.
22

MR. NIVER:

Yes, it has.

AS AMICUS. CURIAE

1

QUESTION:

Right while we're on that point, what's

2

your view of whether the probable cause was enhanced in any way

3

in Chadwick by virtue of an automobile being involved or was the

4

probable cause complete before the automobile came into the

5

picture?

6

MR. FREY:

It was complete before the automobile came

7

into the picture.

8

automobile came into the picture, and you still could say that

9

once it was placed in the automobile, I think it's a matter of

10

11
12
13
14

But it was complete in Sanders before the

semantics whether you would say there was probable cause to
search the automobile or to search the bag.

There's probable

cause to search the bag whether or not it's in the automobile. T|he
rationale of Sanders, which I think is important here, is that
luggage and automobiles have very different privacy characteris
tics and values that are assigned to them by our society, so

15

that the fact that the rule allows the search of the automobile
16

on probable cause but without a warrant will not carry the day
17

when what is inside the automobile is something which has more
18

substantial privacy attributes than the automobile.
19

Now, I would like, in the limited time I have today,
20

first to discuss why petitioner is wrong in saying that privacy
21

expectations have nothing to do with the Warrant Clause.

Now,

22

the Fourth Amendment does not -- its terms require warrants as a
23

precondition for searches, but the Court has held that certain
24

classes of searches will be unreasonable per se under the
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

50

1

Reasonableness Clause of the Fourth Amendment, unless a warrant

2

is procured in advance.

3

QUESTION:

Well, what the Court has really said, that

4

all searches are unreasonable without a warrant, with certain

5

well-defined and limited exceptions, hasn't it?

6

certain classes are --

7

MR. FREY:

Not that only

Well,the Court has said several things, and

8

I suppose we could go back and forth.

9

ments that look In several directions, and what I would like to

I think there are state­

lesser societal privacy values attached to them, it is appro­
priate for the Court not to require a warrant but to permit -QUESTION:

The question is, what does the Constitu­

Isn't that it?

16

MR. FREY:

Exactly.

Yes.

QUESTION:

And the basic constitutional provision

17
18

speaks in terms of reasonable, not in terms of what.
19

MR. FREY: Exactly. But the Court has , in some circumstanc es 9
20

and in the case of the search of a home, to take the paradigma­
21

tic. cases, it is unreasonable to search a home without a war­
22

rant because of the way our society views the interests of the
23

individual in

the home, and the costs that are involved in

24

giving the police free rein to go into the home based on their
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

51

1

2

own judgment.

Now, this case --

QUESTION:

Well, just last week, or within the last

3

two weeks, we have indicated that point, have we not, in terms

4

of the home being a place entitled to greater protection than

5

an automobile or some other vehicle, a moving vehicle?

6

MR. FREY:

Yes. Now, this case, I'd like to begin by

7

stressing that this case is not about the substantive criteria

8

that govern a search.

9

looking for the same question, whether there is probable cause.

The police officer and the magistrate are

10

The question therefore is not whether there is no expectation

11

of privacy, in which case you're dealing with no search, but

12
13
14
15
16

the magnitude of the privacy expectation.

So the case is about

Fourth Amendment procedure.
Now, the decision whether or not to require a warrant
involves, I believe, weighing the costs of requiring the police
to secure a warrant against the potential benefits to be derived
from the procedures.

Let me talk first about the costs.

17

I think people sometimes assume that the warrant
18

procedure is entirely cost-free.

That is not in fact true.

19

Now, the costs are not prohibitive, and in many circumstances
20

the costs are well worthwhile.

But the most obvious cost is

21

the cost in police time.

When a police officer seizes an item

22

and it's required that he procure a warrant, he must carefully
23

be sure that he puts in his search warrant application all the
24

facts that he knows in order to make sure that he's shown
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

52

1

probable cause.

2

or misstatements.

3

the time that this is happening, if he were not required to

4

procure a warrant, he could be on the street performing law en­

5

forcement and community caretaking functions.

6

whether this cost, which I don't want to exaggerate its magni­

7

8

cases.

He must be sure not to include inaccuracies
It is a time-consuming procedure.

During

The question is

Now, there is also a cost to innocent suspects, I be­
And I'd like to refer to Footnote 12 in Sanders.
The state made the argument that for an individual

who is stopped on the street and is about to be arrested because
the police have probable cause to believe that a package, container,
or item that he has with him has contraband , the state said , it's bet­
ter for the police to make that determination then and there
than arrest him and take him down to the station house.

And

15

the court's response was, well, he can simply consent.
16

Now, I'll just mention one difficulty with that and
17

that is that a police officer does not have to accept a consent
18

and if a police officer has probable cause and he came to me
19

for advice in an important case, I would tell him to decline
20
the consent, arrest the individual, and take him and the con­
21

tainer down to the magistrate, because the consent is a questior

22
of fact which will be litigated at the suppression hearing and
23

may provide a basis for suppression of evidence that would not
24

be available If the officer went ahead and obtained a warrant.

3

Now, turning to the benefit side of the equation, the
courts -QUESTION:

Well, are you saying any more there than

4

that it is the shrewd, the safe thing to do, is always get a

5

warrant, if you've immobilized the contraband or the object of

6

your search?

7

MR. FREY:

If you believe you have probable cause. If

8

you don't have probable cause, then you would accept the consent

9

if a voluntary one is secured.

10

11
12
13
14
15
16
17

QUESTION:

You're not suggesting that you always must

have a warrant if it's convenient to get a warrant?
MR. FREY:
definitely not.

But

I'm suggest that requiring -- no, no,
I'm

suggesting that requiring the offi­

cer to procure a warrant will result in some class of cases in
people actually being arrested and detained for a considerable
period of time while the warrant is procured, even though either
the warrant application will be rejected or in most cases will
be granted, and it may tiurn out that there was nothing in the

18

container after all that justified the arrest.
19

QUESTION:

By 1that do you mean, if he's arrested on

20

Saturday afternoon, he might be detained until Monday?
21

MR. FREY:

I would hope not.

QUESTION:

Well, that's the practical --

MR. FREY:

It's possible here at one, two o'clock in

24

the morning, although there were independent grounds for
25

54

1

the arrest, he might have been detained.
Well, let me move over to the benefit side, because I

2
3

think that is even more important to focus on.

4

the warrant that involve elimination of general searches by

5

specifying what is to be searched and seized are wholly inappli­

6
7

8
9
10

11

The benefits of

cable, it seems to me, when you're dealing with a container
which has already been seized, and you know exactly what it is
that's to be searched.

The benefit of the warrant that it pro­

vides notice of authority to the homeowner or person whose pro­
perty is to be searched is again wholly immaterial.

That per­

son has in most of these cases seen the seizure and he is
sitting in the jail while the warrant application is being pre­

12

pared .
13

Now, the third and the most important and relevant one
14

here, of course, and I think generally the most important bene­
15

fit of the warrant requirement, is that it serves a prophylactic
16

function, and when the magistrate performs his role properly
17

there will be a certain number of cases in which the determina­
18

tion by an overzealous police officer that there is probable
19

cause will be corrected by the magistrate, and an unreasonable
20

search will be prevented.
21

Now, this benefit fully justifies the warrant require­
22

ment in case where the costs associated with the unreasonable
23

search are substantial in terms of an invasion of privacy values.
24

On the other hand, it does not, it seems to us, justify the

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

55

1

costs of the warrant procedure when you are dealing with con­

2

tainers that have lower privacy value.

3

senting judge in this case likened this container to a package

4

of highway flares that he had recently purchased at a store that

5

were similarly wrapped.
Now, I think the point that the Court has to focus

6
7
8
9

10
11
12

on is, suppose that a police officer thinking that it was
marijuana, but not having probable cause, searched and found a
package of highway flares.

How much benefit would have been

obtained to society and to the important privacy interests that
the Fourth Amendment is designed to protect by going through
the warrant procedure with the magistrate?
So that I do think that the warrant requirement must

13
14

For instance, the dis­

be assessed in terms of the magnitude and nature of the privacy
interest.

I don't have time to get into whether these kinds of

15

containers are of that nature, but I would like to address a
16

point that Justice Stewart raised earlier, which is the clarity
17

point.
18

It's been suggested that if the rule is that you must
19

always get a warrant for any search of a container, that will
20

clarify things and make it easier for the officer on the beat.
21

I agree that clarity is desirable but I have two difficulties,
22

I guess, with that.

The first is that you must find that the

23

Constitution requires that clarity alone is not a sufficient
24

virtue to require it under the Fourth Amendment unless the
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

56

1

Constitution does.

2

The second point, however, is that it will not elimi­

3

nate the uncertainties that are associated because it will sim­

4

ply move the focus of inquiry from the present focus, which the

5

courts of appeals, we submit, have done a reasonably good job

6

with, to a different place, to a shopping bag, a blanket, a

7

paper bag, and so on.

8

I see my time has expired.

MR. KRAUSE:

warrants.

I would like to report to Your Honors that they are being really

country should be grateful for that, and they can be used, and
19

they can be used effectively.
20

On the retroactivity point, there are lots of things
21

to say.

First, Chadwick and Sanders, by their own language,

22

say that they are applying existing warrant requirements.

And

23

they are not new law.

Secondly, the states are free to decide

24

whether a particular decision of this Court shall or shall not
25
North American Reporting

QUESTION:

Well, If you're correct in your first

point, then the retroactivity question doesn't even exist, be­

4

5

vel

MR. KRAUSE:

Yes, that's my feeling also, and I agree

7

with you, Justice Stewart, but some justices don't agree, and

8

there are two cases that say that regardless of retroactivity

9

the states have the right to choose themselves, and I'd just

10

like to mention that.
QUESTION:

11

12
13
14

Well, states certainly, if there was

no change in the law, no state has the right or the freedom or
the privilege to disregard a constitutional decision of this
Court, does it?
MR. KRAUSE:

No.

No state does have the right to do

15

that.

And I'm sure they wouldn't.

What is a legitimate expec­

16

tation of privacy is something that's come up quite often and
17

Justice Rehnquist has defined it in the Rakas case in a way
18

which is very good, and I don't think it has -- it's the kind
19

of test, Justice Rehnquist, that you would want the policeman
20

in the street to apply.

It's In Footnote 12.

"Legitimation of

21

expectations of privacy by law must have a source outside of the
22

Fourth Amendment either by reference to concepts of real or
23

personal property law, or to understandings that are recognized
24

and permitted by society."

Now, those -- that's a delicate, delicate concept.

And the best test for the policeman on the street is whether

he can see what's in the package or not.

5

If he can't, he should

And that's an easy test that he can apply.

QUESTION:

Was the bag in this case, referred to as

all.

No, you can't say that it was a bag at

All you can say is that they are oblong-shaped packages

that are sealed with masking tape and they are covered with
something like burlap and then over that there is a green plas­
tic.

We don't know where the green plastic came from, so they

were not garbage bags, and it would be a misstatement of the
records to say that they are.
And also, it's a misstatement of the record to say

15

that there was any smell in connection with these packages,
16

Justices.

There was not any smell in connection, nor was there

17

any feel

in connection with this package.

And nor, Chief

18

Justice Burger, was there any evidence that any tests were done,
19

that there was any, that this met any profile of marijuana.

As

20
we have pointed out, the courts have gone to great lengths to
21
say that marijuana is normally wrapped in butcher paper and

marijuana is normally wrapped in burlap and marijuana is normally
