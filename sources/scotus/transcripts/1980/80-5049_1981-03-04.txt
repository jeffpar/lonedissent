7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER CLAYTON IN NO. 80-5049

8

AND OF RESPONJDENT CLAYTON IN NO. 8 0-54

9

MR. McTERNAN:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a Section 301 action instituted by

12

petitioner Clayton, my (client, claiming that his employer,

13

petitioner ITT, discharged him without just cause in violatior

14

of the collective agreement and that his bargaining agent,

15

the UAW, violated its diuty to represent him fairly by with­

16

drawing his discharge girievance from the arbitration process.

17

Clayton's act:ion seeks what has been called by this

18

Court in Vaca v. Sipes

19

tual rights, and to us tthat means either a hearing -- it

20

means a hearing before aa tribunal which can either reactivate

21

his grievance or determiLne his right to reinstatement.

22

judicial enforcement of his contrac­

In the court tbelow both the ITT and UAW asserted as

23

affirmative defenses Cleayton's failure to resort to his in­

24

ternal union procedures..

25

tion that issue was trieed first and the district court held

By virtue of an order of trifurca­

3

1

that the union procedures were adequate to afford him the

2

remedy he sought and dismiss the action against both defen­

3

dants.

4

union was affirmed and the dismissal of the claim against the

5

employer was reversed and remanded for trial.

6

On appeal the dismissal of the claim against the

It is true and uncontestable that Clayton did not

7

resort in any way to his internal union procedures.

He was

8

justified in that, we contend, because to have done so would

9

have been an utterly idle act.

The UAW procedures, we submit,

10

were inadequate as a matter of law; they were inadeqaute in

11

the facts of this case because they could not effect a reacti­

12

vation of his grievance or his reinstatement; and they were

13

inadequate because they were incapable of rendering a deci­

14

sion within the four-month period allowed in Section 411(a)(4)

15

in the first proviso.

16

First, as to> our position that the union procedure

17

was inadequate as a matter of law, we rely first upon princi­

18

ples enunciated by this Court in NLRB v. Marine Shipbuilding

19

Workers to the effect that where the employee's complaint

20

raises matters in the public domain and go beyond internal

21

union procedures, the union procedures cannot be used to

22

delay his resort to the court, to the National Labor Relations

23

Board, for vindication of his rights under Section 8(b)(1)(a)

24

of the amended National Labor Relations Act.

25

Here, too, Clayton asserts rights in the public
4

1

domain,

his right to fair representation, the union's duty

2

fairly to represent him, a duty as developed by judicial in­

3

terpretation and application of Section 9(a) of the amended

4

National Labor Relations Act. And we think that the rights

5

involved stand on the same footing as the rights involved in

6

NLRB against the Marine Shipbuilders.

7

have just tried to enunciate or elaborate was applied by the

8

9th Circuit in Bise v. the I.B.E.W. with a similar result.

The principle that I

9

But perhaps more fundamental than this and going to

10

the competence of the union tribunal is the fact that we deal

1 1

here with rights governed by federal law.

12

enunciated in a number of cases -- Vaca v. Sipes, and Motor-

13

coach Employees v. Lockridge, the automobile case, the name

14

of it escapes me for a moment -- Humphrey v. Moore -- that

15

there's a duty of fair representation.

16

breach of that duty is part and parcel of the Section 301

17

action, and it is controlled by federal law, and the last

18

formulation of that in the Lockridge case was to the effect

19

that whether the proof established the requisites of the

20

breach of duty is a matter of federal law.

21

QUESTION:

This Court has

The claim of the

Well, has the Court really held that

22

these are 301 actions?

Wasn't the genesis of the Vaca v.

23

Sipes doctrine the cases of Tunstall and Steele, years ago,

24

under the Railway Labor Act, when there was no 301?

25

a failure to represent employees fairly and squarely.
5

That is,

1

MR. McTERNAN:

But Vaca v. Sipes, Mr. Justice

2

Stewart, went far beyond the Steele and Humphrey v. Moore,

3

and held that where that breach exists, that is the condition

4

precedent to the employee's right of action under 301 in the

5

court for breach of the collective agreement.

6

QUESTION:

Well, first of all, he has to show and

7

prove that he was not properly represented through whatever

8

the grievance and arbitration procedure may have been by his

9

representative, the union organization.

10

MR. McTERNAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

And only then, after he's proved that,

may he sue the employer.

13

MR. McTERNAN:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Right.

Is that the -- ?
Right.

And in that --

And any suit against the employer would

be a plain vanilla 301 action.
MR. McTERNAN:

Well, but:the language in Vaca v.

17

Sipes -- there are two sections, and one I recall precisely

18

is that the Court said in that opinion that the claim of the

19

breach of the duty of fair representation is part and parcel

20

of the Section 301 action.

21

opinions from this Court as well as many in the courts of

22

appeals which say that the breach of the duty claimed is part

23

of the Section 301 action.

24

seem to me necessary to conclude that if proving that breach

25

is a condition precedent to going on to the claim of --

And I think that there are other

And as a matter of fact, it would

1

2

Well, except that the Tunstall and Steele

cases were decided in the total absence of anything like 301.

MR. McTERNAN:

QUESTION:

5

MR. McTERNAN:

That's right.

As I recall, that's

true.

8
9

And they were actions only against the

union, were they not?

6
7

Quite so; quite so.

QUESTION:

I don't think you're right there.

10

weren't they?

or not.

17

18

cept as true, yes.

19

Oh, excuse me, they were in Humphrey v. Moore, but
But the rest of what you said I ac­

That's the way I recall it.

But what I want to emphasize in response to

20

Mr. Justice Stewart is that the claim of breach of the duty

21

of fair representation Is coupled with the claim of breach of

22

the collective agreement.

23

the employer in court, thus not being involved in the arbi­

24

tration proceeding, only by virtue as proof that the union

25

has breached its duty to him.

And the employee is allowed to sue

So I say that if we deal here
7

1

with matters of federal law under Section 301 both with

2

reference to the claim of the breach of duty and the claim

3

of breach of the collective agreement, we deal with matters

4

which are entrusted to the courts under Section 301, the

5

statute explicitly to this effect,

6

interpret and apply that law; the UAW tribunals are not com­

7

petent to do so.

8

will, that responsibility to the courts would be a violation

9

of the principles of Lincoln Mills, and therefore I say that

And

only the courts can

And for the courts to delegate, if you

10

for all of these reasons that this UAW procedure was inade­

1 1

quate as a matter of law.

12

QUESTION:

Well, do you concede, Mr. McTernan, that

13

the liability of the employer under an action such as this

14

is necessarily conditioned on the liability of the union also':

15

MR. McTERNAN:

Well, it's conditioned upon proof

16

that the Union breached its duties, and this Court has held

17

that the employee may sue the employer alone and prove in

18

that action the union's breach of duty, and therefore estab­

19

lish his right to go ahead on the merits of his breach of the

20

collective agreement claim.

21

Now, when we get to damages we have another problem

22

and as the Court said in Vaca v. Sipes, the union's liability

23

to the employee in these cases is only for the increases, if

24

any, and the pecuniary damage done to the employee by reason

25

of the union's conduct, but the union cannot be held liable or
8

1

damages for the damages caused by the employer's conduct.

2

And so the doctrine of comparative fault, if you will, is

3

established in Vaca so as to involve an apportionment of the

4

damages as between the employer and the union.

5

swered your question, sir?

6

QUESTION:

Have I an­

Part of that, I suppose, is that if he

7

sues the employer alone and that case went to judgment, the

8

judgment against the employer should not include any damages

9

that were caused by the union.

10

MR. McTERNAN:

I would think so, yes.

Well, you

11

see, if he got a judgment against the employer, that might

12

very well be an order of reinstatement with back pay at least

13

up to the point where the union's conduct took over.

14
15
16
17
18

QUESTION:

Well, not if the union was responsible

for the discharge.
MR. McTERNAN:

Oh, well, now, you've raised a dif­

ferent point.
QUESTION:

It's not a different point if the union

19

had maliciously caused the discharge.

20

employer's going to be liable for back pay.

21

MR. McTERNAN:

I don't know that the

Mr. Justice White, this Court has

22

been very careful to distinguish those cases in which the

23

conduct of the employer and the conduct of the union were

24

independent and discrete, and where each would be then liable

25

for his proportionate share of the damage caused.
9

But where

1

they act together, as was pointed out in the opinion in

2

Czosek v. O'Mara, there you have a different problem, and

3

there can be joint liability because they acted jointly.

4
5

6

QUESTION:

And what if the union tells a lie to the

employer about an employee and the employer discharges him?
MR. McTERNAN:

This Court has affirmed in a number

7

of cases NLRB orders where it is quite clear that the employer

8

acted under pressure from the union, but yet the employer is

9

responsible for its conduct.

Now, the apportionment of it is

10

a different matter and I'm not arguing that now.

1 1

that the employer can be liable and has --

12

QUESTION:

But I say

Well, in those cases the employer knows

13

that it's acting under pressure from the union.

14

acting in perfectly good faith and the union just tells it a

15

lie about -- ?

16

MR. McTERNAN:

Suppose it's

Then I think the apportionment rule

17

would apply, but I don't think the employer would be relieved

18

of his duty to reinstate the man.

19

20
21

22

QUESTION:

No, no, but he certainly wouldn't be

paying back pay.
MR. McTERNAN:

I think that if all of the back pay

losses stemmed from the union's conduct, then I would say --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. McTERNAN:

25

QUESTION:

All right, all right.
Yes?

Mr. McTernan, may I ask you a kind of a
10

1

preliminary question?

If you assumed, contrary to your argu­

2

ment, that the union did provide a completely adequate remedy,

3

that they had some totally impartial review situation and

4

would give an answer within two weeks, say, would you concede

5

or would you not that in that situation there's a duty to

6

exhaust?
MR. McTERNAN:

7

Well, sir, I don't think that it's

8

consistent with Lincoln Mills for the judiciary to delegate

9

to union tribunals the interpretation and application of

10

federal law under Section 301; number one.

1 1

I think that however detached and dignified the union tribu­

12

nal is and however fast it could act, it simply is unable

13

functionally to effect the most important aspect of the

14

restoration of this employee's contractual rights, namely,

15

his right to have his job back.

16

QUESTION:

And number two,

Well, supposing the collective bargaining

17

agreement has a provision in it that if that review board

18

found there was inadequate representation there's a duty to

19

reopen the arbitration proceeding, and so on.

20

assume for a moment that you could conceive of an adequate

21

remedy.

22

-- which I don't see why you couldn't, but I just want to kno^

23

what your view is -- would you still say there's no duty to

24

exhaust?

25

a duty to exhaust, what's the source of it?

I want to

I want to know whether or not you would still argue

Or does this depend on inadequacy?

11

And if there is

MR. McTERNAN:

1

I think that there is no unqualified

2

duty to exhaust.

I think that exhaustion which involves the

3

union tribunal and the interpretation and application of

4

federal law would be a miscarriage of the doctrine under

5

Lincoln Mills.

6

if the union tribunal had the power to reactivate the grievant

7

by finding that the union breached its duty, there might be

8

some room there for requiring exhaustion, assuming that the

9

time limitations could be satisfied.

However, I can see the situation in which,

In that we have a prob­

10

lem here.

In this case, Mr. Justice Stevens, there is no

1 1

provision in the collective bargaining agreement for the arbi­

12

tration or further processing of grievances which the union

13

decided it had withdrawn in breach of its duty.

14

As a matter of fact, as I intended to say later,

15

there is evidence in this record of an intent quite to the

16

contrary.

17

the

18

the end of the road so far as the contract remedies were con­

19

cerned, and my colleague here advised the trial court that

20

ITT conceded

21

the grievance even if the union found that there had been a

22

breach of its duty.

23

QUESTION:

There was a stipulation at the trial that one,

'grievance

was

withdrawn from

arbitration.

It was

that it had no obligation whatever to reconsidei

But you do concede, do you not, under

24

this agreement that the employee couldn't go directly into

25

court?

He had to first go to the union and see if the union
12

1

would press his claim to arbitration?

2

MR. McTERNAN:

3

QUESTION:

4

Oh, yes; we're talking about the griev­

ance procedure.
MR. McTERNAN:

5

6

procedure?

QUESTION:

8

MR. McTERNAN:

Yes; the first stage.

QUESTION:

But did the employee ask the union to

1 1

take it to arbitration?

12

MR. McTERNAN:

Oh, yes, and as a matter of fact

arbitration was requested and then withdrawn by the union.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. McTERNAN:

16

Well, the grievance procedure under

the collective bargaining contract provides for a three-step -

10

13

The collective bargaining agreements

Is that what we're talking about?

7

9

I don't concede that in this case.

Yes, but he had to do that, didn't he?
Oh, no question about that.

He had

to invoke his contract remedies.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. McTERNAN:

Right.
That's very clear in all of the cases

19

yes.

20

step those at all.

21

It's when he's deprived of those remedies by union conduct

22

that breaches --

23

And we don't claim that he would be entitled to side­

QUESTION:

Of course he's required to do that.

Well, Mr. McTernan, in prior cases, I

24

recall, when it was suggested that if the union breached its

25

duty, and therefore the employee shouldn't be bound
13

1

by defective grievance and arbitration procedures, I recall

2

the arguments on behalf of the employee were that he shouldn't

3

be sent back to arbitration either, because he would be there

4

being represented, or at least accompanied by, or at least

5

with a party in the picture that had shown it incapable of

6

representing him.
MR. McTERNAN:

7

Yes, there is that problem, and

8

that problem exists, it seems to me, in any reactivation case.

9

I don't think we have to meet that problem here.

10

QUESTION:

No.

1 1

MR. McTERNAN:

But let me say that in your opinion

12

in Vaca v. Sipes, you considered the question of whether the

13

Court should decide the collective bargaining contract issue or

14

whether it Should be remanded for arbitration, and the Court held

15

there, in your language, that this was a remedy for the trial

16

court to consider in light of the circumstances of the partic­

17

ular case.

18

to it, because I don't think it's possible to make an inflexi­

19

ble rule.

20

now and resume later?

And It seems to me that's a very sound approach

I had hoped to save some of my time.

21

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

22

QUESTION:

May I desist

Very well.

Mr. McTernan, before you sit down, there s

23

been called to my attention a recent 2nd Circuit case decided

24

about two weeks ago, Johnson v. General Motors.

saying it's positive one way or the other, but I think it

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVERETT F. MEINERS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER ITT .GILFILLAN, ETC.
MR. MEINERS:

10
11

Thank you.

Mr.

IN NO.

80-54

Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I would like to initially direct my comments to the

12
13

very difficult if not impossible situation which the lower

14

court decision has left the employer in.
The employer must defend the union's good faith as

15
16

a result of that decision in refusing to go to arbitration.

17

The employer, of course, was not a party to that decision,

18

wherein the union made the determination that there was no

19

cause in their mind, no justification, to take that grievance

20

that Mr. Clayton had filed and that they.had. initially'requested

21

arbitration.

22

that matter to arbitration, that they could not prevail on

23

that case.

24

In the grievance procedure and arbitration procedure the

25

union is the party that investigates that procedure and makes

They concluded that there was no reason to take

But the employer was not a party to that process.

15

1

that determination.

2

was not involved in any manner in a

3

attempt to convince the union not to proceed to arbitration.
QUESTION:

4

The company did not take any action and
determination or an

I might have missed it, but the Union

5

didn't give any reason for withdrawing, it just withdrew;

6

isn't that right?
MR. MEINERS:

7

Well, Your Honor, they did, the union

8

steward did write a letter to the National Labor Relations

9

Board advising them that they had investigated the case.

On

10

page 78 of the Appendix there's a copy of that letter indi­

11

cating that they found no just cause, or that there was just

12

cause for the termination, and indicating also that Mr. Clayton

13

was a union steward and was held to a high standard of care

14

with respect to activities of that type.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Meiners, as I've tried to think

16

through this argument that the employer is in an impossible

17

position

18

it correct that the employee has the burden, rather severe

19

burden, of showing arbitrary conduct by the union and what it

20

really amounts to is, you have two defenses?

21

your defense that you didn't reach the contract in the first

22

place, and you have the additional defense that maybe

23

can't prove arbitrary conduct.

tract issue should be reached in that lawsuit where -QUESTION:

MR. MEINERS:

Well, it's certainly relevant to the

8

issue of proving no damages, but if the employee only proves

9

that there's been a breach of the duty of fair representation,

10

certainly under Vaca there would be this allocation problem.

11

But his next step then would be to establish that there has

12

been a breach of the contract.

13

My personal feeling is that neither the company nor

14

the union should be in a situation where either is required tc

15

defend the actions of the other in the discharge situation.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Well, they don't have to.

I mean, you

still have your own defense that you had no breach of contract.
MR. MEINERS:

That's correct.

However, that de­

19

stroys the efficacy of the arbitration grievance procedure

20

which normally is a complete block to the issue of the under­

21

lying, reaching the issue of the underlying grievance unless

22

there's a breach of the duty of fair representation by reason

23

of the lower court's decision in this case.

MR. MEINERS:

Well, I'm assuming that.
And in that situation if the union

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And you're able to prove that, if the

fairly simple case.

15

MR. MEINERS:

Well, that may be true, yes.

We woulc

16

hope so, if we were ever called upon to present that case.

17

But the problem here is one of whether or not the union's

decision not to proceed to arbitration is one which the

employee at will can avoid?

that's the -- we're skipping over the defense which has to be

-- I guess maybe we can get back to this -- why should the

employee be able to go to arbitration and require a resolu­

tion of this issue if the union in good faith had made a

determination that this is not an issue that should be re­

solved in arbitration?

7

QUESTION:

Why should the employee

Well, I thought that the employee has

8

got the burden of proving a breach of duty, and you don't

prove a breach of duty just by saying that the union failed

10

to take it to arbitration.

11

MR. MEINERS:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So, it's a rather -- if reasonable men

13

could have differed about the validity of the claim, the

question that the employer has got to get over.

MR. MEINER:

reasons that we have indicated that this presents

company would have to commence some type of a discovery pro­

is you take a deposition of the steward and he says, I inves­

tigated the claim and I thought the company was right; that's

why I abandoned it.
MR. MEINERS:

7

Except, the union may well not be in

8

a position that they feel that it is either politically or

9

appropriate for them to take an active role in this.

And it

10

may be one where it is difficult for the employer to obtain

1 1

the cooperation

of the union in presenting their claims.

QUESTION:

12

The real issue in these breach of duty

13

cases, as I understand it, at least in an awful lot of them,

14

is whether or not there was real substance in the claim that

15

the employer breached the contract.

16

MR. MEINERS:

QUESTION:

Well, but

then, in our view --

Your employer is the one that knows

18

that.

19

case, that you fired him for cause, like the contract requirec,

there's not going to be any breach of duty in the union, is

there?

24
25

And if you can substantiate, even make a reasonable

MR. MEINERS:

No.

There's not going to be a breach

of the duty in the union; that's correct.
QUESTION:

But the --

But there's also -- if one were to adopt

the principle that the employee can go directly into court,
23

1

you're going to inevitably be involved in a lot of line­

2

drawing problems.

3

says, that the union simply decided there was no merit to the

4

claim, but there could be conceivably some very complex rea­

5

sons why the union decided not to process the claim.

While some may be simple as Justice Stevens

MR. MEINERS:

6

Yes, there could.

And I think that

7

from the employer's viewpoint, this gets back to the basic

8

problem that we see whereby this type of a case may end up for

9

resolution before a court and/or a jury.

It is our belief

10

that the better method to resolve this controversy would be

11

to have a remand of the case to arbitration and for the arbi­

12

trator to review the issues and to make the ultimate decision

13

which he should have made, should have been called upon to

14

make.

15

MR. MEINERS:

Has expired during the process of -- ?

How can you get him back?
Because I believe that the Nolde

1

Brothers decision raises a substantial question as to whether

2

or not because of the national labor policy that is deemed to

3

be incorporated in the collective bargaining agreement when

4

it is written, that -- and in that case the decision indicated

5

that unless the agreement expressly or directly negated the

6

possibility of the grievance in that instance -- of course the

7

contract had expired -- I think that the same situation can be

said to apply here.

and based on the strong national policy which favors arbitra­

suggest that the processing of

MR. MEINERS:

So that, we can see a situation under your

Nolde Brothers decision and looking at Vaca v. Sipes, that the

5

employee does have a right that if there is a determination by

6

an internal union remedy, that the employee does have the

right to reinstitute the grievance and to proceed back into

8

arbitration.

9

be examined is the posture of the employee when he goes back

And I think that one of the points that needs tc

10

to the arbitration procedures.

I think that the employee

11

should raise if -- there are a number of different cases,

12

some cases where the union is clearly discriminating against

13

the individual.

In other cases they have merely let lapse

14

the time limit,

in a situation where they've let a time limit

15

lapse negligently or whatever the standard is that makes that

16

act

be a breach of the duty of fair representation.
QUESTION:

17

Would you agree that after the letter

18

that was written, Appendix page 78, that he hasn't got a very

19

enthusiastic advocate in the arbitration proceeding?

20
21

MR. MEINERS:

Yes, that's correct, I would agree

with that.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. MEINERS:

He'd have topo out and get his own counsel.
I think that one of the possibilities

24

is that the employee may obtain his own counsel in an appro­

25

priate case.

I think that this is a matter which should be
26

1

raised before the internal union remedy,

2

this instance, to determine that maybe there is an internal

3

discrimination against him, and he needs additional protec­

Anything in union regulations or the

QUESTION:

Of course, you agree that the predicate

3

to getting back to the arbitration table or getting to the

contract claim at all is contingent on proving the breach of

duty by the union?

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Which, in the first instance, if you

8

don't require them to -- or, in any event, is going to have

9

to be decided by a court.

MR. MEINERS:

Well, I don't believe that's true

1 1

that in any event it would have to be decided by a court.

12

I think that that is the ultimate --

That's a separ

QUESTION:

If there's a suit filed against the

19

employer and the union claiming the union breached its duty

20

and therefore the employer breached the contract, the courts •

Well, then, if that's going to have to

be tried out, an awful lot of the facts in the case are going

there was a breach of the contract.

have to face the contract provisions.

If I were an employer I would think that

15

MR. MEINERS:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, I agree with that.

Yes.

Well, then, this has to be tried out in

a court, and an awful lot of the facts and the circumstances

MR. MEINERS:

Yes.

That the union is considered

The union, of course, has a
29

1

broad range of authority here and is only held to a very

2

stringent standard, and it is generally authorized, of course,

3

under Vaca v. Sipes to be the exclusive agent and to repre­

sent the employees in all of their cases, and to make deter­

minations if sometimes the case that the employee is wanting

This is a no-attempt case.

The third sort of case is a case where the attempt

of their operations were allowed to function, the grievance

of cases where there is a dispute as to whether or not the

23

matter is arbitrable.

Those are the sorts

Now, I can address, if I will, all those cases, but
I would like to stress that the issues that have been

discussed earlier, many of the issues

only on that third set of cases, which is not this case.

What's the source of the duty

The source of the duty, Your Honor,

10

is the discretion of the federal judiciary in Article III.

It's an Inherent discretion of the district court to stay its

hand until the controversy is ripe, consistent with federal

13

policy and consistent with Republic Steel v. Maddox, to see

ground, if it's futile, I mean, if he's told, as was the case

in Glover, that this is not for blacks, that's a different

Maddox to hold their hand, at least for that period.

to prove the breach of duty by the union, he can't proceed.
MR. WHITMAN:

No, the question is whether he is

not able to prevail against the union because he didn't at­

20

tempt the internal procedures and didn't give that opportunity

21

to the union.

22

QUESTION:

You think this holding, this exhaustion,

23

just protects the union, and that he could still be free to

prove your breach of duty in his suit against the employer?

QUESTION:

Does the employee have the same choice

as the employer to choose litigation over arbitration?

MR. WHITMAN:

That's right, Your Honor.

Then he doesn't have to name the union

as a party?
MR. WHITMAN:

This Court held in Vaca, as I read it,

7

that he doesn't.

In Vaca, in fact, there was a separate

8

piece of litigation pending at the trial court level.

9

was only brought against the union.

in the reverse situation, or it can occur, and it most com­

13

QUESTION:

Dr. Whitman, then, these upper levels of

14

the union appellate process, if I may call it that, that

15

you've described, is the employee very often successful after

16

defeats in the lower levels?

17

MR. WHITMAN:

Well, Your Honor, yes, he often Is.

18

In fact, it's ironic that his percentage of success is greater

before the Convention Appeals Committee and the delegates

20

than it is before the Public Review Board.

that a fellow ought to be able to get a lawyer and sue, now,

20

Even if the grievant is not wronged by this claim, there may

be a greater wrong, a wrong to the collective interest.

the union and the individual ought to have a chance to
