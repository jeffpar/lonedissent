ORAL ARGUMENT OF RODERICK E. WALSTON, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

8

We will hear arguments

MR. WALSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

9

This case raises very important issues of federal­

10

ism with respect to the control of water resources in the

1 1

west.

12

case with respect to the meaning of the Rivers and Harbors

13

Act of 1899.

14

of that Act the Army Corps of Engineers has authority to

15

override state water rights laws, even where there are no

16

impacts upon federal navigation interests.

17

is whether the 1899 Act affords a private

18

that is available to the plaintiffs in this case.

19

There are actually two major Issues raised in this

The first question is whether under Section 10

The second issue
right of action

Is that really, logically -- isn't the

20

second issue that you mentioned really logically the first

21

issue?

22

MR. WALSTON:

It is indeed.

I've arranged them

23

chronologically, Justice Stewart, for the reason that I will

24

argue only the first question, because we did not raise the

25

second issue in our briefs.

The United States will argue
3

1

the second issue in behalf of the Petitioners.
Briefly, the facts of the case are very complicated

2
3

but I will try to just very briefly skip over them as I may.

4

The case involves water exports by the State Water

5

Project, which is a massive reclamation project in Califor­

6

nia, that essentially exports waters from the northern part

7

of the State to the central and the southern parts of the

8

State.

9

stream into the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta, and then pump­

The projects actually release waters that flow down­

10

ing plants on the south end of the delta pump the waters to

11

the users in central and southern California.

12

is extremely vital to California's economic health.

13

vides a water supply to about 14 million people, which is

14

over half of California's population; provides irrigation

15

water to about one million acres of prime agricultural land.

16

And in fact the State project has been in operation since

17

1967 so it's been exporting water since that period.
QUESTION:

18

This project
It pro­

The Central Valley Project was authorized

19

before the Federal Government made any contribution to it at

20

all, wasn't it?
MR. WALSTON:

21

That's correct.

The Central Valley

22

Project is a federal reclamation facility that essentially

23

parallels the state facility and it's been operational since

24

the 1930s.

25

The precise issue in this case is whether Section 10
4

1

of the Act authorizes the Corps of Engineers to control the

2

allocation of water from this project, as I say, pursuant to

3

Section 10 of the Act.

4

Section 10 essentially contains two clauses that

5

are before the Court.

6

major clause.

7

obstructions to navigable capacity without the approval of

8

Congress.

9

condition of navigable waters without approval of the Army

10

The first clause is in our view the

It establishes a general prohibition against

The third clause makes it unlawful to alter the

Corps of Engineers.

1 1

And the State's argument may be briefly summarized

12

as follows.

13

is an effect on navigable capacity as that term is used withir

14

the meaning of the first clause.

15

applies only where there is an effect upon federal navigation

16

interests.

17

Section 10 in our view applies only where there

And therefore Section 10

Now, the question, does Section 10 apply to water

18

allocations that are adopted by the states under the water

19

rights laws?

20

alternative arguments.

21

not apply to state water allocations at all.

22

gue that if Section 10 does apply in that context, the Court

23

should develop a kind of common law or rule of reason test

24

governing its meaning in that kind of situation.

25

this rule of reason test, we argue that Section 10 should

And on that question we raise essentially two
First, we argue that Section 10 does

Second, we ar­

And under

1

apply to state water allocations only where there is a sub­

2

stantial effect upon the capacity of waters to support actual

3

4

To state it very briefly, we argue that Section 10

applies only where, to state water allocations only where

there is a substantial effect upon federal navigation inter­

Now, the Court of Appeals rejected our

12

to the existence of federal navigation interest.. And it fur­

13

ther held that Section 10 fully applies to state water allo­

14

cations and that the Court should not develop any kind of

15

common law or rule of reason test with respect to the meaning

16

of Section 10 in that situation.

17

In other words, Section 10 applies without regard

QUESTION:

When you talk about federal common law,

18

do you mean something different than a construction of

19

Section 10?

20

Do you want us to overrule Erie v. Tompkins?

MR. WALSTON:

No, we mean precisely a construction

21

of Section 10, Justice Rehnquist.

22

of Section 10 indeed that this Court rendered in 1899 in the

23

Rio Grande case, and at that time the Court held that the

24

Section 10 applies only where there is a substantial effect

25

on navigable capacity in an area where navigation is a

It is the same constructior.

1

recognized fact.

That's precisely the language of the Court's

2

decision.

3

of reason test which we regard as kind of a common law test.

4

If the Court of Appeals' interpretation of Section

5

10 is correct, then we concede that Section 10 fully applies

6

here,

7

condition of navigable waters; and we concede that.

8

our own interpretation of Section 10 is correct, then Section

9

10 does not apply in this case because the State Water Project

So the Court in that case appeared to adopt a rule

16

that part of the delta.

The exports at most reduce water levels in the

And this reduction has no

Now, a rule of reason test is in essence an attempt

18

to accommodate conflicting, or at least, potentially con­

19

flicting goals on the subjects of navigation and reclamation.

20

Specifically, we are urging this Court to attempt an accommo­

21

dation between federal navigation interests

22

and the congressional policy on the other hand of deferring

23

to the water right laws and the water supply systems that

24

have been developed by the western states.

25

on the one hand

Indeed, the very purpose of the Rivers and Harbors
7

1

Act of 1899 was to prevent obstructions of navigable capacity,

2

and thus to protect federal navigation concerns.

3

has held that that Act was passed for the very purpose of

4

overcoming this Court's decision in the Willamette Bridge

5

case, a case in which this Court held that there is no federal

6

common law with respect to obstructions to navigation.

7

fore, in our view, the 1899 Act should be applied at least

8

in this situation only where there is an effect, an actual

9

effect on actual visible federal navigation interests.

10

This Court

There­

This result, we believe, is reinforced by the con­

11

cept that Congress has historically delegated broad authority

12

and control to the western states to control their water

13

rights system.

14

several laws that were passed by Congress in both this century

15

and in the prior century relating to the subjects of reclama­

16

tion, desert lands, mining, and a vast array of other types

17

of subject matters.

18

This delegation of authority is based upon

And under this delegation of authority the western

19

states have actually developed administrative water rights

20

systems in which they have been trying, and successfully

21

trying, to control and manage their water resources.

22

deed the water exports in this very case have been authorized

23

under California's own water rights system.

24

own water rights system is controlled by the State Water

25

Resources Control Board, which has authorized the allocation

And in­

California's

of the exports of water in this case, subject, however, to

2

conditions that were intended to protect the environmental

3

quality of the delta itself.
These state water allocation systems that have

4
5

been developed by the western states are absolutely vital to

6

their economic growth and prosperity.

7

many ways, and Congress has dealt with the west in a unique

8

way.

9

western states have, in effect, developed reclamation systems

The west is unique in

The west has much land but very little water, so the

for the purpose of transporting water from where it originates

11

to where it may be used and where it is needed by human

12

beings.

13

QUESTION:

14

as far as Stockton?

When you say, the delta, does that go up

15

MR. WALSTON:

Yes, it does, Mr. Justice.

16

Under the Court of Appeals decision, the Corps of

17

Engineers, however, could override potentially any state water

18

allocation that is authorized under state water rights laws

19

as long as there is an effect on the condition of navigable

20

waters, even though there may be no effect whatsoever upon

21

navigation or navigable capacity.

22

Well, in practical reality, most state water allo­

23

cations affect the condition of navigable waters.

24

practical matter, the Court of Appeals' decision would allow

25

the Corps of Engineers essentially to control most water

Thus, as a

western states.

If this is so, then the Corps of

It would be responsible for ultimately con­

For example, it could determine the allocation of
water between competing agricultural groups, or between com­

peting urban groups, or between competing agricultural and

11

urban users.

12

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you there for a moment?

13

It could not properly do so, could it?

Because its only in­

14

terest in the allocation would be in protecting the navigable,

15

the Interest in free navigation.

16

MR. WALSTON:

That would our position, Justice

17

Stevens, but the Court of Appeals held that the Corps of

18

Engineers could go beyond that situation and could control

19

water allocations even where there is no effect on --

20
21

QUESTION:

Control it only to the extent that you

have to get a permit before you go forward?

22

MR. WALSTON:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.

And if they reviewed the facts and said,

24

well, the only thing that's at stake here is an inch change

25

in the water table or something like that, wouldn't we expect
10

1

them to grant the permit?

2

think they'd rather have Stockton have the business than

3

San Joaquin, or something like that?

4

MR. WALSTON:

They wouldn't deny it because they

Well, it's difficult

to say exactly

5

what the Corps of Engineers would do with that kind of situa­

6

tion, but under the Corps of Engineers regulations, it could

7

look to any public interest factor in determining whether

8

the water should be used for one purpose or the other.

9

other words, the State would determine if the water should be

In

10

used by one particular group of farmers in one particular

11

region.

12

of Engineers could effectively --

13

And under the Court of Appeals' decision, the Corps

QUESTION:

Do you think the Corps of Engineers --

14

say you're going to build a bridge across a. river and some­

15

body says, we've got to have a permit.

16

could deny the permit if they found that there would be no

17

interference with navigation, but they just didn't think it

18

was in the public interest to build a:bridge?

19

20

MR. WALSTON:

Do you think they

That's what the Court of Appeals said,

Justice Stevens.

21

QUESTION:

Well, do you think the Corps of Engi­

22

neers could override the provisions of the Reclamation Act

23

of 1902?

24

MR. WALSTON:

25

QUESTION:

No, we don't believe that --

Do you think the Court of Appeals thought
11

1

2

it could?
MR. WALSTON:

Yes, I think the Court of Appeals

3

assumed that the Corps of Engineers is not governed by

4

Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902.

5

recently in California v. United States that Section 8 of

6

that 1902 Act gives the states very broad control of reclama­

7

tion, but the Court of Appeals addressed that question and

8

said that the State's power simply does not apply in any

9

situation where the Corps of Engineers is exercising its

10
11

This Court held

powers under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.
In effect, the Court of Appeals read Section 8

12

out of the Act insofar as it applies to water diversions that

13

might fall within the parameters of the Corps of Engineers'

14

authority under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.

15

To pursue the point, the power that is thus given

16

to the Corps of Engineers under the Court of Appeals decision

17

is immensely broad.

The Corps could determine, for example,

And under the Court

the Corps of Engineers could make that

There is nothing in the language or the legislative
history of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 that provides
12

1

any indication that Congress ever intended for such a massive

2

federal intrusion into an area that has been traditionally

3

regulated by the states themselves.
QUESTION:

4

Did this lawsuit originate as a suit by

5

the Corps of Engineers against the State of California, or

6

was it a privately instituted lawsuit?
MR. WALSTON:

7

It was a privately instituted law­

8

suit.

The plaintiffs in the case are the Sierra Club and

9

other groups in and around the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta.

10

The Corps of Engineers -- or I should say, to be more precise

11

certain federal officials were sued as codefendants along

12

with the State of California.

13

QUESTION:

So the federal Corps of Engineers acting

14

under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 was not complaining

15

about what California was doing by way of diversion through

16

the Tracy plant and so forth?

17

MR. WALSTON:

No.

The Corps of Engineers was not

18

complaining at all.

19

It was a private lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club and other

20

private groups against the State and the Federal Government.

21

That's correct, Justice Rehnquist.

The Corps of Engineers' own regulations, by the

22

way, provide an indication of the potential breadth of the

23

Corps' authority over the state water right systems that

24

have been adopted by the western states.

25

own regulations, the Corps is authorized to consider any
13

Under the Corps'

1

factor relating to the "public interest" in the process of

2

approving or denying a permit applications.

3

even define the factors that relate to the public interest.

4

And these factors are, among other things, water supply, food

5

production, land use, aesthetics -QUESTION:

6

The regulations

Well, how much of this is speculation

7

as long as the Corps with this broad body of regulations was

8

simply leaving you alone until a private cause of action was

9

asserted?
MR. WALSTON:

10

Well, it's difficult to say what posi­

1 1

tion the United States and the Corps of Engineers would now

12

take with respect to the State water diversions in this case,

13

to

MR. WALSTON:

about the State

QUESTION:

Now you know that the Corps of Engineers

believes that the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit was correct,
MR. WALSTON:

That's exactly correct, Justice
14

Stewart.

And for that reason we would strongly urge that

2

this Court reach the merits of the case, regardless of what

3

disposition it might make with respect to the procedural

4

question of whether the courts have a -QUESTION:

5

How could we?

How could we if there's

6

no private right of action, how possibly could we reach the

7

merits?
MR. WALSTON:

8
9

Stewart, but we would hope that the Court might point --

MR. WALSTON:

13

Naturally you hope so.
--something in the way of --

You hope we'll decide the private cause

of action the other way.

14

MR. WALSTON:

15

QUESTION:

16

Well, perhaps you could not, Justice

Yes, that's correct.

And if we don't, how can we possibly

reach the merits?
MR. WALSTON:

17

Well, the Court has on occasion made

18

alternative holdings, and that's the kind of thing we would

19

look to in this case if the Court upholds our private right

20

of action.

21

22

QUESTION:

But we have to get over the threshold

first before we can get to alternative holdings, don't we?

23

MR. WALSTON:

24

QUESTION:

25

That is, perhaps, correct.

Well, if we said it wasn't a private

cause of action, I suppose y6u'd set aside all the opinions
15

1

and judgments in the case, and wouldn't you win, then, or not?
MR. WALSTON:

2
3

Well, we wouldn't really win, Justice

White, because --

4

QUESTION:

Why?

5

MR. WALSTON:

Why is that?

-- we have to go back to California

6

and then we wouldn't know whether we are subject to Corps of

7

Engineers jurisdiction or not.

8

9

the meantime we -QUESTION:

10

We wouldn't know that for

You mean the Corps of Engineers might

then say, might say to you, might bring an action to enjoin

MR. WALSTON:

13

Yes.

I would assume that the Corps

14

of Engineers in the future would take the same position that

15

it is taking -- as now.
QUESTION:

16
17

As now; and then that the delta plant

needs a permit?
MR. WALSTON:

18

Right.

And that we would obviously

take the same position that we take now, to the effect that

20

the pumping plants do not need a permit.

QUESTION:

2

MR. WALSTON:

You didn't ask for it either, did you?
No, that's correct.

3

for a permit in this case, but only under protest and in

response to the decisions of the lower courts in this case.

We do -- our application has been under protest.

MR. WALSTON:

No.

In light of its present position

23

I would except that it should have done that, and I think it

24

did not do that for the reason that Its position on the

25

issues in this case was apparently not clear at the time of

the district court action.
QUESTION:

Well, what if it filed -- had said in

its brief here, we would like the case remanded so we can

MR. WALSTON:

We would have no objection to that.

if the merits can be reached that way, then we would welcome

4

QUESTION:

5

6

All right, I will.
I think they're --

I don't want to waste your time, then.

Go ahead.
MR. WALSTON:

Okay.

The approach which we're sug­

7

gesting to this Court, again, I emphasize focuses

on the

8

existence of federal navigation interests and concerns.

9

This approach is intended to preserve the traditional insti­

10

tutional roles that have been carried out by the Corps of

11

Engineers in the western states with respect to the control

12

and management of water resources In the west.

13

The Corps of Engineers has traditionally focused on

14

navigation, and has traditionally been concerned with naviga­

15

tion, but not with water allocation.

16

states have traditionally focused on water allocation and

17

under the congressional delegation of authority that I men­

18

tioned earlier have traditionally been responsible for allo­

19

cating water among competing needs in the west.

By the same token, the

20

Therefore, the Corps has no particular expertise

21

over this subject matter, and the states on the other hand

22

have a lot of expertise on this subject.

23

Appeals decision would effectively allow the Corps to essen­

24

tially usurp this historic role occupied by the states and

25

begin to take over this role for the Corps of Engineers itself
22

But the Court of

1

It would allow the Corps essentially to occupy a role that

2

has been historically occupied by the western states.

3

approach is designed to achieve some kind of accommodation or

4

balance between federal and state interests, federal naviga­

5

tion interests and state reclamation interests.

6

So our

On the one hand, our approach would prevent the

7

states from incurring federal navigation interests and there­

8

fore would protect the federal concerns that underlie the

9

Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.

But on the other hand our

10

approach would authorize the states to reclaim their arid

1 1

lands in situations where there are no impacts upon federal

12

navigation interests.

13

that this Court seek some kind of accommodation or balance

14

between federal and state interests.

15

So, in that sense, we are urging

And I emphasize, once again very strongly, that

16

this Court has in effect followed and adopted the very ap­

17

proach which we are urging.

18

this Court appeared to adopt a rule of reason test in de­

19

fining the meaning of Section 10, and its definition of that

20

test is essentially the same that we are offering to this

21

Court today.

22

In 1899 in the Rio Ghande case

In the Sanitary District in Wisconsin cases, the

23

Court held that Section 2 was applicable to water diversion

24

from Lake Michigan that reduced the shipping capacity in the

25

Great Lakes region by about three million tons each year,
23

1

and thus had a substantial effect on the rights of the many

2

states that border Lake Michigan.

3

QUESTION:

But that was because a state was a party

4

and when states are parties this Court has original juris­

5

diction and we have to fashion a body of common law.

6

MR. WALSTON:

Yes; well, that's correct.

So the

7

Court obviously had to reach the question in that case and

8

you're suggesting the possibility that the Court may not have

9

to do so here.

But nonetheless, the Sanitary District case

10

stands for the proposition that where there's an effect on

11

federal navigation interest, as there were in that case in

12

Lake Michigan, then Section 10 surely applies.

13

have that kind of an effect in this case.

14

But we don't

So, essentially, we are arguing that the Court

15

should accommodate federal and state interests in this case

16

by seeking an accommodation or balance of these Interests in

17

the fields of reclamation and navigation.

18

test the Court followed in the Rio Grande case.

19

it be followed here.

20

reserve a few moments for rebuttal.

the Court:
The federal respondents were brought into this case

as defendants, as counsel for California has indicated, with

against them.

is supporting the judgment below?

MS. STILLMAN:

We are here supporting petitioners

QUESTION:

But your primary argument is that the

with directions to dismiss it.

QUESTION:

Did the Government take this position

with respect to the delta plant in the lower courts?
MS. STILLMAN:

10
11

But you --

The Government took not much of any

position with respect to the delta plant in the lower courts.

12

QUESTION:

So, your answer Is, no, it didn't?

13

MS. STILLMAN:

14

QUESTION:

No, but it didn't take -- well, it

Well, it did not press this argument about

15

the delta plant in either the district court or the Court of

16

Appeals?

17

MS. STILLMAN:

Correct.

That's correct, Your Honor,

18

But it certainly never at any time took the position that the

State Is exempt from the Act or that State water allocation

systems are exempt from the Act, or the types of arguments

the State has pressed today.

In this Court, therefore, as they did below, the

19

federal respondents are challenging the right of the Sierra

20

Club to bring the suit, and they're saying that the State is

21

wrong in suggesting that there is some sort of special

22

exemption for states or for states with state water alloca­

23

tion systems, or for state water allocation systems that

24

don't substantially impair navigation.

25

I will devote the first part of my presentation to
27

1

the private right of action issue, since we agree that that's

2

the threshold issue and we don't reach the question on the

3

merits, if you agree with us on that issue.
In'

4

recent decisions of this Court concerning the

5

question of whether a private right of action under a federal

6

statute may be implied from the terms of that statute, this

7

Court has made it clear that the critical question is con­

8

gressional intent.

9

Mortgage Investors' Association, Touche Ross, Cannon v.

10

I refer to cases such as Transamerica

University of Chicago, and the Amtrak case.
This Court has indicated in those same decisions

1 1
12

that there are various critical categories of evidence

13

respecting congressional intent, critical in showing an ab­

14

sence of any intent to create a specific implied remedy under

15

the Act.

16

the statute contains within itself a specific remedy, and

17

moreover, a remedy that is specifically entrusted to federal

18

officers to enforce.

19

One of those two -- one critical factor is whether

Another critical factor is whether it appears that

20

Congress enacted the statute for the benefit of the public

21

at large or whether it enacted the statute for the benefit

22

of a special class.

23

We submit that with respect to Section 10 of the

24

Rivers and Harbors Act, that both of those factors are

25

present and that they indicate that there was no intent on
28

1

the part of Congress to include an implied private remedy to

2

enforce the statute.

If it appears that someone is in violation of the

11

Act and efforts by the Corps to secure compliance are un­

12

availing, the Corps can go to the U.S. Attorney, to the

13

Justice Department, and suggest to them that action in court

14

is advisable.

15

QUESTION:

But you say that this very expert body

16

let this mischief, if it be a mischief under the Court of

17

Appeals' decision, go on unchecked for a long period of time

18

until its attention was called to it by private litigants.

19

MS. STILLMAN:

I'm not sure how long it went on,

20

I'm not sure that it appeared -- it didn't appear overnight,

21

but a decade ago I think it might have been gradual.

22

don't assert -- we think that the Corps is expert.

and morals?
29

MS. STILLMAN:

Only when speaking of matters of

navigability.

3

then, if the Corps thinks that court action is necessary, it

4

may ask the U.S. Attorney to seek appropriate relief, and

5

this may be criminal penalties; it also may be injunctive

6

relief.

7

provision for Section 10, specifically provides for both.

8

If it appears that someone is in violation,

And Section 406 of the Act, which is the enforcement

I might call the Court's attention to the fact
that, of course, Section 406, where it says that the courts

10

will have jurisdiction to enjoin the removal of structures in

11

the waters, found illegal under Section

12

in Republic Steel has construed that as much broader, that is

13

that the U.S. Attorney when he is seeking remedies against

14

violations of the Act, is not in fact limited to the literal

15

language of that sentence.

16

9 and 10, this Court

And in making that judgment the Court emphasized

17

that the reason he is not limited to that is because Congress

18

in this statute was securing the interests of the United

19

States, and in Section 17 of the Act they said that the

20

Department of Justice shall conduct these proceedings to

21

enforce, all necessary proceedings to enforce the provisions.

22

And it was a very strong strain in the Republic Steel case,

23

emphasizing that we have to have a broad remedy here, because

24

this is the interests of the United States that are being

25

enforced here, and that powers of the Attorney General are
30

1

brought to bear in these proceedings.

2

can read from that case a sense that the broad types of

3

equitable relief which might be sought by private parties

4

are contained in the Act because Congress wanted private par­

5

ties to have those powers.
Second, nowy

6

some

And I don't think you

of the courts, and the Sierra

7

Club, say, well, Section 17 only concerns criminal proceed­

8

ings.

9

is the one to bring these criminal proceedings.

That's

only

saying

that the Department of Justice
But this

10

means that the phrase, "all proceedings necessary to enforce

11

the Act," doesn't include injunctive relief, and that just

12

can't be true, because injunctive relief is obviously quite

13

critical to the enforcement of the statute.

14

says the Department of Justice shall control those proceed­

15

ings.

16

statute to federal officers, of course, is not absolutely

17

preclusive of a private right of action, although it is ex­

18

tremely strong evidence.

And Section 17

Language expressly assigning enforcement of the

But here, as we have noted, it is strengthened by

19

20

the second consideration, that this statute was enacted to

21

protect the right of the public, the public at large.

22

was not enacted for a special class, as this Court has found

23

in other statutes such as the Voting Rights Act in the Allen

24

case.

25

the Cannon decision, the Court specifically describes the

And it

And in fact, in the Cannon decision, in Footnote 13 of

31

1

Rivers and Harbors Act as a statute enacted to protect the

2

rights of the public at large.
The Sierra Club has argued that Congress must have

3
4

intended to authorize suits under Section 10 of the Act by

5

private parties suffering special damages, because Congress

6

would have been aware of the principle that persons suffering

7

a private nuisance may sometimes enjoin a public nuisance

8

where they have special damages.

9

that Congress must have contemplated such private enforcement

They have also suggested

10

of the Act because it was concerned with this Court's decision

1 1

in the Willamette Bridge case, a case that was brought by

12

private parties and dismissed because there was no federal

13

law for them to bring the case under.

14

QUESTION:

Did you suggest that injunctive proceed­

15

ings under 17 may be brought only by the Department of

16

Justice?

17
18

How about the Corps of Engineers?
MS. STILLMAN:

Well, request.

But can Justice turn

them down?

MS. STILLMAN:

MS. STILLMAN:

Yes, I believe Justice could.

And similarly, with Interior?
Yes.
32

QUESTION:

1

Well, that's always been a hotly con­

tested matter within the Executive Branch, has it not, whe­

3

ther or not the Department of Justice shall control the liti­

4

gation of federal claims or whether other agencies within the

5

Executive Branch shall have the right to their own repre­

6

sentations?

7

MS. STILLMAN:

That's correct, Your Honor, but in

8

this case it says in Section 17, the Department of Justice

9

shall control all proceedings to enforce the provisions of

10

this Act.

1 1

here.

12

So I think it's -- I think it's less of a question

QUESTION:

So, if somebody goes forward with a

13

diversion without a permit, the only thing the Corps can do

14

about it is to ask Justice to bring suit?

15

MS. STILLMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes.

And if the Justice Department says,

sorry, no permit is required, that's the end of it?
QUESTION:

However hotly contested, the Department

19

of Justice, the Attorney General has invariably prevailed,

20

has he not?

21
22
23
24

25

MS. STILLMAN:

Yes, I would think so.

They're not

sensitive to second-guess policy decisions of agencies, cer­
tainly, in the Justice Department.
The Sierra Club also relies, as I say, on the
Willamette case.

These arguments might have some force if
33

c .S

1

Congress had written a statute different from the one that

2

they wrote.

3

thus-and-such a structure shall be a nuisance, or an uncon­

4

sented structure shall be unlawful.

5

that creates a system of review.

6

the problems, to illustrate the problems with the Sierra

7

Club's argument, we might profitably look at the Willamette

8

Bridge case itself.

But they didn't write a statute simply saying,

They wrote this statute

And I think to emphasize

That case involved plans to construct a bridge

portions of that river were entirely within the State of

Oregon.

After the Rivers and Harbors Act was passed, if the

19

20

statute is construed as we say it should be construed, what

21

Senator Dolph's clients, Mr. Hatch and his coplaintiffs would

22

have done, is go to the local Corps of Engineers and say,

23

these people are planning to build this bridge over the

24

Willamette River and they haven't gotten their plans approved

25

by you.

And the Corps could go to the bridge builders and
34

1

say, you can't build that bridge unless you show us your

2

plans, and then we approve them.

3

noncompliance, the Corps of Engineers could go to the Depart­

4

ment of Justice and say, enjoin the building of that bridge,

5

because they're going to build it on improper plans.

If there was refusal and

However, if the Corps of Engineers looked at the

6
7

plans and said, those plans look fine to us, go ahead and

8

build your bridge; even if Senator Dolph's clients, Mr. Hatch

9

and his coplaintiffs didn't like it and thought the bridge

10

would still be inconvenient to them, they would have no rights

11

under this Act to say, that bridge is a nuisance, don't

12

build It, because this Act doesn't protect the individual's

13

convenience, it protects the rights of the public.

there had been private action to try and prevent bridges

enacted to make something unlawful that the court had not

been willing to hold unlawful, but not to change the reme­

MS. STILLMAN:

But we think it did change the reme­

dial setup because of the way the statute was constructed.
QUESTION:

It took away a remedy that was pre­

viously available?
MS. STILLMAN:

Yes.

And we think that if you look

17

at Senator Vest's comments, he thought really what you needed

was federal enforcement here, that that's what would take

care of the situation.

Did he say, though, that sure, he wanted

potential, we believe that's what Clause 3 really means,

these are things that might have the potential for disturbing

If I may, I would like to address first the ques­

tion of the private right of the plaintiff to bring this suit.

13

And at the outset I would like to emphasize that unlike the

14

situation

15

Cannon, and the Transamerica cases, we are not proposing

16

that this Court try to discern from the legislative language

17

of the plaintiff in the Amtrak, Touche Ross, the

19

We agree that the test here is legislative intent,

20

and unlike the dilemma that we frequently find ourselves in,

21

here we are able to gauge legislative intent quite accurately.

22

And I think it's possible In this case to actually determine

23

the state of mind of the Congressmen who enacted the Rivers

24

and Harbors Act of 1890, which was the predecessor of the

25

Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and which all counsel agree,
43

1

I believe, is the relevant statute for determining the legis­

2

lative intent behind the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.

3

Counsel has agreed, and I think the federal defen­

4

dants have acknowledged in their brief, that the purpose of

5

the Congress when they enacted the Rivers and Harbors Act of

6

1890 was, in effect, to overrule a decision of this Court in

7

Willamette Iron Bridge Company v. Hatch.

8

think it instructive to go back to Willamette Iron Bridge v.

9

Hatch and examine how that case would have been decided with

For that reason I

10

the change that was wrought by Congress when it enacted the

1 1

Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890.

12

Willamette Iron Bridge v. Hatch was a suit brought

13

by a citizen of Oregon against another citizen of Oregon to

14

abate a nuisance.

15

statute of the United States that rendered unlawful the con­

16

struction of a bridge that obstructed navigation.

"That bridge is a nuisance because it obstructs navigation

18

and it is made unlawful by an Act of Congress."

QUESTION:

He said,

He didn't need to add the latter, I take

it, did he?
MR. CLARK:

He did, I believe, Your Honor, in that

case, because he was suing in a federal court, and he sought

23

federal relief in --

24

QUESTION:

Well, he only said it was a nuisance.

25

MR. CLARK:

But, Your Honor, his only basis of
44

1

federal jurisdiction -QUESTION:

2

You can conclude it was a nuisance becaus

3

it was Obstructing navigation.

4

MR. CLARK:

Yes, Your Honor, but it was between the

5

citizens of the same state.

He had no jurisdiction in federal

6

court unless he could show that his case arose under a federal

7

statute.

8

Oregon into the Union and contained some language that

9

recited that the Willamette River would be forever free for

So he relied upon that statute which admitted

10

navigation. He said, "The construction of that bridge ob­

1 1

structed navigation and it provided the necessary element of

12

a private cause of action for nuisance, that is, that the

13

obstruction

was

unlawful."

And this Court said to him, just as it had said in

14
15

a string of very similar cases decided in the 19th Century

16

in language that sounds like it was directed at Congress

17

rather than to the private litigants, that "you are right

18

every step of the way with one exception, there is no federal

19

statute which makes the obstruction of a navigable waterway

20

unlawful."

21

Now, that was the culmination of a series of cases,

22

many of which, or a number of which at least came to this

23

Court and were decided the same way.

24

Congress had enacted the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890.

25

I believe that what Congress intended quite clearly from the
45

And within two years
And

1

enactment of that particular statute was to put Mr. Hatch in

2

the position where if that lawsuit had been brought after the

3

enactment of that particular law, he would have prevailed. He

4

would have prevailed on the theory of a private nuisance, and

5

he would have to have shown that he was specially injured

6

just as anyone would have to have done at that point in time

7

and today in order to prevail on a claim of a private nui­

8

sance .

10

QUESTION:

He wouldn't have had to show that the

navigability of a navigable stream was obstructed?
MR. CLARK:

11

He would have, Your Honor.

He would

12

have had to show some sort of obstruction.

13

obstruction was the only ground of nuisance at that point in

time.

16

thing other than injury to himself.

There were other

23

case, for example, that Congress intended to protect the

24

interest of the nation in both navigable waterways and pure

25

waterways, when it enacted the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899

I believe this Court has held in the Standard Oil

46

1

and that is the reason that in addition to Sections 10 and 12

2

upon which plaintiffs rely here, it also enacted a number of

3

other sections designed to prevent dumping and pollution --

4

did not use the word pollution -- and it enacted a number of

5

other sections designed to keep our waterways clean.

6

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that kind of a suit

7

were you saying that that kind of a case would technically

8

arise under a federal statute and give a federal district

9

court jurisdiction?

10

MR. CLARK:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, all you're saying, it's a cause

12

of action for nuisance.

13

what you're arguing is that this isn't, that kind of a case

14

wouldn't be a private cause of action under the Rivers and

15

Harbors Act at all?

16

MR. CLARK:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CLARK:

And you aren't saying -- I guess

If you are, then there -Well, Your Honor, it's largely --- wouldn't be any federal jurisdiction?
That is largely true.

What

Congress

19

intended to do and I think quite clearly intended to do was

20

provide a federal statute so that this kind of action would

21

in fact arise under federal law.

22

of the alternative to that conclusion indicates very strongly

23

why Congress must have so intended.

MR. CLARK:

courts, but we would not have a uniform development of a law

12

were preserving a particular right rather than simply allow­

13

ing Congress to create rights.

14

MR. CLARK:

Your Honor, that may be.

I think what

15

I am attempting to do primarily is to determine what Congress

16

actually intended,

17

I think it is true, and I think it is the most logical and

18

probable interpretation of the intent of Congress back in

19

the last century, that when it enacted this particular law

20

it did contemplate the bringing of actions of this kind.

13

only of the legislative history of this Act but the contem­

14

It was somewhat different back then from what it

I think our brief

is today.

federal agencies was the exception.

reversed in the 80 years since the enactment of the Rivers

unusual at all.

MR. CLARK:

Yes, he fishes in San Francisco Bay.

He is not affected by the lowering of water levels by having

21

such as on any solely environmental grounds.

22

The Sierra Club has stated that assuming that the

For at page 31

of the United States brief, last full sentence, the United

3

that an alteration or modification must be of a type with

4

the potential for affecting navigation; i.e., that water

MR. WALSTON:

I suppose it's hypo­

QUESTION:

The lower court

You don't -- Is it true that the delta

21

pumping plant will reduce the level of the water in the river

22

at that point and down river;to ascertain extent?

23

MR. WALSTON:

According to the district court's

24

findings, the pumping plant would reduce water levels in the

25

delta in the interior delta channels where commerce actually
65

1

takes place by about one inch, and that is the combined

2

export of water both by the State pumping plant and by the

3

federal pumping plant.
QUESTION:

5

At the present levels, isn't that

right ?
MR. WALSTON:

6

That's correct, yes.

But the district

7

court also held that in the area near the pumping plants

8

where there is no commerce the water exports, the combined

9

exports from both the federal and state projects would there

10

reduce delta water levels by about this much, a foot and a

half.
