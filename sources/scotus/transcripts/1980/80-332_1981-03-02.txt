ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN P. ADLER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF :0F THE PETITIONERS
MR. ADLER:

8
9

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the

11

United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit for that

12

court's affirmance of a decision of the United States District

13

Court for the Southern District of Ohio holding that double-

14

celling at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility is uncon­

15

stitutional .

16

The single issue before this Court is whether the

17

double-celling of prison inmates constitutes cruel and unusual

18

punishment.

19

QUESTION:

I thought that the District Court at one

20

point in its opinion says it was not holding that double-

21

celling per se was unconstitutional?

22

MR. ADLER:

That's true.

The District Court said

23

that it was not holding double-celling per se was unconstitu­

24

tional, but at three or four different places in that opinion

25

it held that double-celling was unconstitutional.
3

In the

1

record in the case the judge states another three or four

2

times that the question before the court is a question of

3

double-celling.

4

QUESTION:

You say in effect that since he found

5

nothing but double-celling as a disadvantage to the Drisoners

6

he must have held double-celling was unconstitutional?

7

MR. ADLER:

Well, he found a few other unrelated

8

things not to be to his liking.

9

the area of necessary services to be deficient.

10

He

found

nothing

in

He only founc

that double-celling was unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

1 1

Mr. Adler, would you say that there are

12

some inconsistencies in the district judge's discernment ■.

13

here?

14

MR. ADLER:

I definitely would.

As I was saying,

15

the single issue before this Court is whether the double-

16

celling of prison inmates constitutes cruel and unusual Dunisl

17

ment where the inmates were provided with reasonably adequate

18

food, clothing, shelter, sanitation, medical care, and per­

19

sonal safety.

20

The District Court found SOCF to be a top flight,

21

first class institution, built in the early 1970s.

22

the institution to be quiet, light, and airy,

23

food service facilities to be completely adequate.

24

the institution to be comfortable, not to be hot or stuffy.

25

It found no excessive noise, and few odors.
4

It found

the food and
It found

The visitation

1

facilities were more than adequate.

There had been no in­

2

crease in the level of violence in the'institution, the inmate

3

to guard ratio was better than that recommended by various

4

experts, the lighting was adequate, the plumbing was adequate.

5

1,150 inmates were working, 426 inmates were attending school.

6

School facilities were light, airy, and well equipped.

7

was a modern library containing 25,000 volumes, and the law

8

library was adequate; there was no evidence of indifference

9

to the inmates' medical needs.

There

Medical care was adequate.

10

The question of the adequacy of clothing'was not raised, nor

11

was the question of disease or illness.
Because the District Court found that prisoners at

12
13

SOCF were provided with all the services necessary to maintair

14

their lives and health, it cannot now be argued that -the

15

institution was unconstitutionally overcrowded.

16

argued that the District Court

17

18

ameliorate what it saw to be overcrowded conditions.

QUESTION:

It has been
double-

General Adler, can I ask you just a ques­

tion about the facts for a moment, ahd the relief?
The case was decided, I think, in 1978, if I'm not

21

22

mistaken.

23

population by 25 inmates a month, as I remember the relief.

24

And if my arithmetic is correct, I assume that the order pro­

25

bably brought you down so you don't have any double-celling

And I think the judge ordered you to reduce the

5

1

2
3
4

anymore?
MR. ADLER:

That's correct.

They achieved a popula­

tion of 645 sometime in July of 1979.
QUESTION:

So we're kind of arguing -- I understand

5

the State still has an interest and it's not moot but it's kinc

6

of a theoretical problem now, I gather.

7

MR. ADLER:

Well, the inmate population of the

8

State of Ohio since this case has been decided had gone up

9

and not down, so we have more of a problem now on a statewide

10
11

basis than we did at the time.
QUESTION:

But ndt actually -- but not in this par­

12

ticular institution?

13

transfer people back in, I guess?

14

MR. ADLER:

You're really fighting for the right to

That's correct.

It's the only adequate

15

maximum security institution the State has.

16

the case was tried the State of Ohio felt, or the administra­

17

tors felt, that they had 2,300 maximum security prisoners.

18

By reducing that population that would mean maximum security

19

prisoners in the medium security institutions, which has

20

heightened problems in those institutions.

21

QUESTION:

And at the time

General Adler, actually, of course, it's

22

the Court of Appeals' decision which we're reviewing, which

23

is somewhat perfunctory.

24

of Appeals says, ''Upon consideration of the record on appeal

25

together with the briefs and oral arguments of counsel the

At A-3 of the petition, the Court

6

1

Court concludes that the findings of fact of the District

2

Court are not clearly erroneous on this, that its conclusions of

3

law are permissible from the findings of fact."

4

Now, isn't that a somewhat unusual statement from a

5

court of appeals to say that a conclusion of law is permissi­

6

ble from a finding of fact?

7

narily say it's either right or wrong?

8
9

10

MR. ADLER:

Doesn't a court of appeals ordi­

I would much prefer if they would say

either it's right or its wrong.

To tell you the truth, I was

very disappointed in that opinion, contrasting with all --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ADLER:

Well, take this or any opinion you lose.
Well, in contrast with the recent opin­

13

ion that came out of the State of Colorado, an opinion of the

14

10th Circuit that ran on for, I think, 80-some pages, this

15

case was dealt with in less than a page and a half.

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, on that basis you might say that

the 10th Circuit was 50 times as wrong?

18

MR. ADLER:

19

QUESTION:

Possibly.
Mr. Adler, now that we have you inter­

20

rupted, may I ask something?

21

Hogan's findings of fact, he recites a number of empirical

22

social science studies, as I understand them:

25

as to what would be an adequate amount of floor space per

Fifteen square feet?
MR. ADLER:

3

Ten square feet, or what?

Well, my suggestion would be that where it

4

can be shown that because of the lack of floor space there is

5

a deprivation in one of these areas, these core areas --

6

sanitation, personal safety, shelter, that's where the cutoff

7

should be, and not just because someone picked 60 feet out of

8

the air and sets that as a minimum standard.

I'm no expert in that area and I,

16

Because the District Court found the prisoners at

17

SOCF were provided with all the services necessary to maintain

18

their lives and health, it cannot not now be argued that the

19

institution was unconstitutionally overcrowded.

20

argued that the District Court did not end double-celling,

21

therefore, only reduced the inmate population to alleviate

22

what it saw to be overcrowded conditions.

23

never found SOCF to be unconstitutionally overcrowded.

24

It has been

But the Court

The District

1

objectionable but only ordered the inmate population reduced

2

to what the court perceived as the single-cell capacity of the

3

institution, thereby insuring that each inmate had private

4

sleeping quarters.
The institution contained 1,620 cells measuring var­

5

6

iously

7

than

8

63 square feet and 68-1/4 square feet.

There are more

20 acres under one roof.
At the time of trial SOCF had approximately 2,300

9

inmates. Although it was claimed that SOCF was overcrowded

10

because of a great number of conditions, including double-

1 1

celling, the court found deficiencies in only four areas:

12

jobs; a delay in education; the number of social workers and

13

psychologists had not increased along with the population of

14

the institution; and it found some past deficiencies in the

15

area of dental care.

16

QUESTION:

One has to reason from the Constitution

17

in a case like this, I suppose, and is overcrowding a synonym

18

for cruel and unusual punishment?

19

MR. ADLER:

Assuming this case was decided' in the wa y

20

other cases have been decided, the courts have held that the

institutions are unconstitutionally overcrowded.

QUESTION:

All of them do, don't they?
All of them do.
Well, in answer to my brother Rehnquist,

12

I guess the answer is, the unconstitutionality has been found

13

in a holding of violation of the Eighth Amendment.

14

The Court of Appeals didn't use the term.

MR. ADLER:

Is that the way you read it?
The way I read it is that the District

Court found the institution to be unconstitutional.

They

24

never found the institution to be in violation of the Eighth

25

Amendment.

He mentions the Eighth Amendment in the preface
15

to his findings of fact and conclusions of law, but at the

2

end simply finds the practice of double-celling to be uncon­

3

stitutional .

4

QUESTION:

Well, it has to -- I would suppose, maybe

5

your sister can tell us otherwise, but I would suppose that

6

he must have found that it violated the Eighth Amendment's

7

ban on cruel and unusual punishments.

8

MR. ADLER:

9

QUESTION:

10

I would have to go -I can't think of any other basis on

which it would be unconstitutional.

Maybe we'll be informed -

MR. ADLER:

Absolutely.

13

QUESTION:

Well, of course, the Court of Appeals

But --

14

explicitly said, we do not read, we do not read the district

15

court holding that double-celling is unconstitutional.

16

So notwithstanding the District Court's apparent finding of

17

unconstitutionality, the Court of Appeals declined to read

18

it that way.

19

MR. ADLER:

"Under all circumstances."

20

they finish with that phrase.

21

QUESTION:

22
23

I believe

Well, this is the only circumstance the

court had any business dealing with.
MR. ADLER:

Well, I think that language comes right

24

out of the decision itself, where Judge Hogan says, I don't

25

find it unconstitutional under all circumstances, just the
16

ones before me.
QUESTION:

The only circumstance that the trial

MR. ADLER:

Right.

It was proportional to the

If there had been two different institutions

Isn't that a major

Now, the Court seems to hold --

Yes, but Wolfish was temporary.

These

men are in there for time.
MR. ADLER:

That's true, but it's still only incon­

QUESTION: Well, is there a difference between

inconvenience and discomfort for a week and inconvenience and

discomfort for 100 years?

MR. ADLER:

We're talking about average sentences

Absolutely.

That's what imprisonment is.
Going to jail is an incon­

12

something more for cruel and unusual punishment.

13

reading of Bell v. Wolfish is correct, and you certainly know

The court found that the population was greater

than the number of cells in the institution.

3

It also found that the average floor space available to

each inmate in each cell was half, and it found the practice

5

of double-celling to have been of long-term duration.

6

Court's fifth finding, that most double-celled inmates spend

7

most of their time in their cells directly contradicts the

evidence in the case, and the Court's previous finding that

MS. KAMP:

Mrs. Kamp.

Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the

Court:
The district judge here found that confinement of

12

13

two men in a 63-square-foot cell in the totality of conditions

14

which existed at Lucasville caused physical and mental injury

15

from long exposure and therefore violated the Eighth Amend­

ment.

17

20
21

QUESTION:

Now, do you think the Court of Appeals

acted on the constitutional issue?
MS. KAMP:

Yes, Your Honor, I think the Court of

Appeals looked at the findings of fact, as was quoted earlier.
QUESTION:

Well, then why did the Court of Appeals

22

say that they did not read the District Court as deciding the

23

case on the constitutional basis?

24
25

MR. KAMP:

I read the Court of Appeals to be saying

that the District Court did not hold that double-celling
23

1

per se was unconstitutional, but rather that under the speci­

2

fic factual findings made about conditions existing at that

institution, the double-celling was unconstitutional and that

the remedy of reducing population was therefore proper.

14

of Appeals in your view decide this case on the constitutional

15

basis ?

16

That's a subsidiary question.

MS. KAMP:

Did the Court

I think it did, Your Honor.

It found

17

that double-celling was not per se unconstitutional, just as

18

the District Court had done.

19

finding that double-celling in the conditions existing at

20

Lucasville, for the period of time they'd existed there,

21

was unconstitutional.

22

QUESTION:

It affirmed the District Court's

They said double-celling -- the prohibi­

the 6th Circuit held that that was what the trial judge had

done here.

I think

Mrs. Kamp, do you get the feeling from

11

the penultimate sentence of the Court of Appeals' opinion

12

saying that the findings of fact are not clearly erroneous

13

and its conclusions of law are permissible, that, say, if this

14

case had come up before Judge Rubin in Dayton and he had

15

found exactly the same findings of fact but held there was no

16

violation of the Eighth Amendment, the Court of Appeals would

17

have affirmed him?

18

MS. KAMP:

I think, reading the 6th Circuit decision,

19

they might well have.

It's a time and totality of conditions test,

20

is a very factual and intensive test, and to the facts found here

21

which are not seriously in dispute about the length of time

22

in cell:, the length of time of confinement, the physical and

23

mental injury .caused by the confinement, the correct, standard

24

is clearly erroneous as applied.

25

totality of those conditions reach an Eighth Amendment

25

Now, as to whether the

kind of question which I think district courts are particu­

larly an appropriate forum to be deciding.

ferent district federal judges in 93 different districts.

7

MS.

KAMP:

No, Your Honor, because all of them have

8

to reach the question of whether the Eighth Amendment has

9

been violated, which means a finding whether, under the

10

totality of conditions, the plaintiffs have been able to

1 1

show an unnecessary infliction of suffering or --

12

QUESTION:

But you say it's an intensely fact-speci­

13

fic thing that one judge could come out one way and one on

14

the other on precisely the same facts.

15

MS.

KAMP:

Well, Your Honor, there could never be

16

precisely the same facts.

sons with somewhat similar conditions have come out with

19

different results.

20

21

totality in fact caused genuine privation and hardship, vio­

22

late contemporary standards of decency.

23

yes, then it was an Eighth Amendment violation.

24
25

QUESTION:

I think the four cases referred to

That's correct.

Well, Mrs.

Kamp,

They've looked at the

If the answer was

if the trier, the origi­

nal trier is looking at the totality or one specific conduct

26

1

like, let us say, the hanging by the thumbs.

The district

2

judge must say, yea, or nay, on whether there's an Eighth

3

Amendment violation, whether it's totality or a specific act.

4

Is that not so?

5

MS. KAMP:

Yes, Your Honor, it's so.

6

QUESTION:

Well, what difference does it make whe­

7

ther he did it on totality or on a specific finding of one

8

cruel punishment?

9

MS. KAMP:

Well, there are some punishments, we

10

would submit, that are so cruel as to by themselves violate

11

the Constitution, such as hanging by the thumbs, such as

12

housing people in 14 square feet, as was mentioned earlier.

13

But that's not what the judge here did.

14

the conditions together and found that double-celling as

15

practised in this particular institution did violate the

16

Eighth Amendment, and therefore he didn't need to reach that.

17

QUESTION:

He looked at all of

I hate to repeat it, but the Court of

18

Appeals said that that's what he didn't find.

19

Appeals said he didn't find that there was a violation here

of the Eighth Amendment under all circumstances.

22

MS. KAMP:

The Court of

Can I direct your attention to A. 36,

5

MS. KAMP:

Yes, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION:

In the last paragraph he says, he quotes

7

from the Gates v. Collier case -- ?

8

MS. KAMP:

That's right, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

And the quotation says, as I read it,

10

that it's a violation of "the Eighth Amendment prohibiting

11

cruel and unusual punishment."
MS. KAMP:

12

Can we just throw that away?

No, Your Honor, on that page he's refer­

13

ring to the third of the factors

14

to the decision in the totality of circumstances.

These are all based on

MS. KAMP:

That's right, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

And what's your suggestion as to the

25

propriety of relying on studies of that kind in determining
a cruel and unusual punishment matter?
28

MS. KAMP:

1

Your Honor, I think it's extremely ap­

2

propriate to rely on such standards.

3

in the AMA brief, which has been filed amicus here, shows

4

the reasons for these standards have been developed, not as

QUESTION:

Well, is there anything to suggest what

10

actually is the adequate amount, in this institution, of

11

floor space per prisoner, to avoid a violation of the Eighth

12

Amendment?

13

MS. KAMP:

Well, what the trial judge did here, he

14

found that in light of the length of time people were in the -

15

cells both on a daily basis and over the long term, that 50

16

square feet would be constitutionally required in order to

comply with this., kind of standard and and protect the mental

18

and physical health of the prisoners in the institution.

QUESTION:

Did you 'argue at the trial?

of which 50 is the minimum.

And these studies were all submitted,

MS. KAMP:

My understanding is that they were part

of the briefs.

QUESTION:

Part of the briefs?

6

MS. KAMP:

And that in the 6th Circuit some of the

7

standards which have been developed since were also presented

8

to the 6th Circuit.

9

QUESTION:

Was any evidence tendered to the court

10

as to the comparative amount of space for each seaman on a

1 1

submarine?

12

MS. KAMP:

I'm not aware of any of that kind of

13

evidence, although I am aware now because of the AMA brief

14

about the Army standard, which requires a minimum of 70

15

square feet and it says that if you have to go below that

16

on an emergency basis for more than a week, you're going to

17

have to assume that you're going to have increased disease

18

and increased disciplinary problems.

19

finding of that was true, certainly not clearly erroneous,

20

as amply supported by what was in the record here.

21

QUESTION:

I think the court's

Well, isn't there some rule that unless

22

you do it by stipulation, to 6ffer simply a book in evidence,

23

the opposing party has a right to cross-examine the person

24

who has collected the statistics or arrived at the conclu­

25

sions?
30

1

MS. KAMP:

Your Honor, to be honest, the is the

2

first challenge I've heard to the appropriateness of the

3

court considering the contemporary standards of decency

4

which are put out by organizations such as the American Cor­

5

rectional Association --

6

QUESTION:

But what if you had an American Ex-

7

Convict Society that said the minimum standards of celling

8

should be 300 feet long and 200 feet wide?

9

the state would have a right to examine the author of that?

10

MS. KAMP:

Don't you think

I would expect them to challenge those.

1 1

They have never challenged the fact that these are the stan­

12

dards of reputable organizations and that they're based on

13

sociological studies and medical and public health evidence

14

which is available and common knowledge.

17

QUESTION:

No one suggests, though, that they repre­

sent what is usual around the country.
MS. KAMP:

No, Your Honor.

There is no question

18

that in this country Lucasville is not alone in being over­

19

crowded and in being double-celled, and that's clearly why

Isn't some of this complicated by the

certification of the matter as a class action?

have a very particularized description of a punishment in­

was found to be cruel and unusual.

20

really not so much saying that a particular individual or

21

individuals are being cruelly and unusually punished, as that

22

an institution is being condemned as being capable of

23

inflicting, capable of cruel and unusual punishment.

24
25

MR. KAMP:

If you go

And here what you have is

Yes, Your Honor.

I think what we're say­

ing here is not that the punishment is disproportionate in
32

1

the Weems sense, but that as a method of punishment it is

2

cruel and unusual because of the way it impacts on the class

3

of people who are housed there.

4

QUESTION:

But yet there are some who, as I read

5

the District Court’s finding, he would not have found as to

6

them as individuals that they were suffering cruel and un­

7

usual punishment.

8
9

MS.

KAMP:

Yes, that's certainly true.

There were

approximately 300 people who were never double-celled and

10

who had never been at issue in this case at all.

right, there were some who were out and who were in school

and job programs who might perhaps -- he did, however, find

13

that 80 percent of the population could be expected to suffer

14

from some sort of mental or emotional disorder and that those

15

conditions would be aggravated by double-celling in the sense

16

of increasing aggressive behavior, increasing tension, in­

17

creasing violence in a fixed space, even though not geometric.

Yes, You're right.

The general popula­

tion were the three-quarters that had some freedom of movement

15

The other quarter were the people who were in protective

16

custody or were in what was called voluntary idle.

17

heard, there were not enough jobs available in the institu­

18

tion .

19

As we

I think the distinction between this kind of prison

20

system and a per se rule which Judge Hogan rejected can be

21

seen in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which has been set

22

forth in the memorandum filed by the United States Justice

23

Department.

Of the people who

QUESTION:

Of those five percent, of course, the

impact is the same as if it
MS. KAMP:

were the 95 percent, is it not?

No, Your Honor, because there's a dif­

4

ferent totality of conditions.

Five percent in an uncrowded

5

institution where services are available for a shorter period

6

of time because you don't have all of the cells double-

7

celled, is a completely different situation from the institu­

8

tion where double-celling is increasing all the time, where

9

most people are in their cells most of the time, where there

10

are minimimal social-psychological and that kind of services.

11

Five percent overcrowding is something that can be dealt

with totally differently than a 40 percent overcrowding as

here, or potentially, of course, much worse.

Well, no, Your Honor.

In the federal

system eight-tenths of one percent -QUESTION:

They sleep in the cells.

they're confined is for some disciplinary measure.

be in

So this is not like Bell v.

36

1

they were talking about anywhere from five to eight or nine

2

hours a day.
QUESTION:

3

But here the District Court concluded

4

that any reduction in the availability of dayrooms due to

5

double-celling was not significant in any respect, didn't it?
MS. KAMP:

6

He did find that with respect to condi­

7

tions in the dayroom.

8

that in his finding that most prisoners were in their cells,

9

all prisoners, for 14 hours a day or more.
QUESTION:

10

That's correct.

He clearly considered

Well, it's kind of circular in a way,

11

because he seems to say that because of the overcrowding the

12

dayrooms are less attractive and then because they're less

13

attractive fewer people used them, and it's very difficult

14

to get a handle on.

15

MS. KAMP:

Well, Your Honor, I think all of that

16

goes to the fact that this is a maximum security prison,

17

where there is so little freedom of movement, wherever

18

you go there's a threat of violence of the kind of assault,

19

homosexual behavior, rape, that he did refer to as increasing.

20

But this is not like the MCC in New York where people could

21

just wander in and out of their cells back and forth to a

22

dayroom.

23

I think that's how you make it consistent.
This, as has been pointed out, is one of many, many

24

cases where conditions in a prison have been challenged.

25

this Court in Hutto v. Finney impliedly approved the test

But this Court should

But this is the kind of question' that has to be viewqd

8

by the District Court taking into account that the Eighth

9

Amendment

prohibits unnecessary infliction of pain and vio­

10

lation of contemporary standards of decency-; that those are

11

standards which can be reviewed; that the District Court here

12

made explicit findings as to unnecessary injury, the viola­

13

tion of contemporary standards of decency, and that therefore

14

should be affirmed, because those findings are supported by

15

the record.

16

QUESTION:

I take it you'd suggest that some' of

17

these social studies at least bear on contemporary standards

18

of decency?

19

MS. KAMP:

I think they're extremely relevant to

20

contemporary standards of decency.

21

which the medical profession, the public health professions,

22

and the correctional experts have seen as necessary to run

23

a constitutional -- or adequate prison. Now, that's not clear­

24

ly thfe same as saying they defined the constitutional limits.

MS. KAMP:

I'm sorry -- yes, of course, we have to

15

In summary I want to say that the State has asked

16

the Court to adopt a test similar to the language in Newman

17

v. Alabama of minimum necessities.

18

that's the same test we're talking about here, that the

19

totality of conditions requires that you look at all of the

20

particular conditions within an institution and determine

21

whether it violates the Eighth Amendment, and that the place

22

to make that decision is in the district courts.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN P. ADLER, ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL

3

MR. ADLER:

First, I again need to point out that

4

Judge Hogan never found conditions at Southern Ohio Correc­

5

tional Facility to be cruel and unusual, nor did he find any

6

condition in that institution that shocked his conscience.

MR. ADLER:

QUESTION:

There is

no test like that, is there?

13

Why would he have done that?

If it's cruel and unusual punishment?
No.
I think someone's got -Talking of conscience, is that the

test under the cruel and unusual punishment?
MR. ADLER:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

I think

someone's conscience has to be shocked.
QUESTION:

Your understanding of the court of

Appeals, then, was quite different from

MR. ADLER:

QUESTION:

2

5

7

MR. ADLER:

That's true; very true.

Now

8

Mrs. Kamp has referred to physical and mental injuries as a

9

result of double-celling.

Now, four psychologists and a

10

physician testified during the course of this trial.

11

those five men knew or any relationship between double-celling,

12

crowding, and any increase in violence.

13

None of

Also, I'd like to address the AMA standards, since

14

there's never been an epidemic at the Southern Ohio Correc­

15

tional Facility, and if some mental damage was done these

16

prisoners, that damage did not manifest itself in any way.

17

There was no increase in behavioral problems, there was no

18

increase in violence, and there has never been a riot in that

19

institution.

20

Now, as to space standards, one of the organizations

21

cited is the American Correctional Association.

22

appearing as a witness in this case was a Mr. Seigler --

QUESTION:

Now, also

Mr. Adler, let me ask you a question

24

about, supposing you win this case and we say, on the record

25

before us none of these things have been shown.
42

And then you

1

continue the double-celling for ten years, and it gets even

2

a little bit more crowded.

3

from relitigation of the problem that the longer period of

4

incarceration and perhaps evidence of further harm resulting

5

from several years of this practice?
MR. ADLER:

6

I would hope so, as long as they could

7

prove no harm has resulted.

8

a specific harm has resulted from the practice, that we'd be

9

back in court on that question -QUESTION:

10

I'm sure if they alleged that

Now, say they do it in six months.

They

1 1

say, well, we really -- and they now allege, we now have a

12

lot more evidence of harm than we had in the first trial.

13

I suppose if you just have' to allege additional harm, you neve:

14

get the benefit of res judicata.

15

MR. ADLER:

16

QUESTION:

I assume that it would be a whole new case .
And I suppose it is possible that the

17

longer these conditions persist, the greater risk you have

18

that that might actually happen?

with some of your problems.

MR. ADLER:

I've talked to prison administrators

11

in other states and they feel the same way you do, although

12

I can't say that of ours.

13

Now, Mr. Seigler who at the time he testified was

14

a past president of the American Correctional Association,

15

when he was asked if he knew of the American Correctional

16

Association standards, he said, no, that he didn't.

17

Also testifying in this case was Mr. Norman Carlson,

18

who is the current Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

19

At the time he testified he was the president-elect of the

20

American Correctional Association, and he testified that he

21

didn't know what the American Correctional Association stan­

22

dards were, and

23

which his name appeared, he stated that he did not help

24

formulate those standards and that he disagreed with them.
