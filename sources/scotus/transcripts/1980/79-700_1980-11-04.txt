ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD T. MANPEARL, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. MANPEARL:

10

11

Mr. Manpearl, you may

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue before this Court is whether a state pro­

12

13

perty tax exemption statute so interferes with interstate or

14

foreign commerce that this Court must declare it unconstitu­

15

tional.

16

have ruled that the statute is a reasonable classification

17

statute and that it does not violate equal protection stan­

18

dards .

At the outset it should be noted that the state courts

19

Also before this Court is a question of whether the

20

County of Los Angeles has standing to raise a federal consti­

21

tutional objection to this legislation.

22
23
24

25

The County of Los

Angeles places great reliance on the argument -QUESTION:

Mr.. Manpearl, let me ask you, did you

argue the Sears case when it was here?
MR. MANPEARL:

No, I did not.
3

1

QUESTION:

2

of counsel there.

3

statute here?

I'd like to ask the same question I asked
The County of Los Angeles is attacking the

4

HR. MANPEARL:

5

QUESTION:

6

That is correct.

And I'm impressed by the utter absence of

the Attorney General of California.
MR. MANPEARL:

7

In California there is no requirement

8

that the Attorney General appear in cases in which a state

9

statute is under consideration or under attack.
QUESTION:

10
1 1

We did not --

Is it not his general duty to defend the

statutes of the State?
MR. MANPEARL:

12

We know of no such duty.

We've had

13

many instances in the state courts -- quite honestly, I've beer

14

litigating property tax matters in the state courts for over

15

16
17

18

ten years and I have never seen the Attorney General intervene
in a case. Although the

official reports, the Sears case was;

21

22

he was well aware of it.

I assume he was well aware of it.
QUESTION:

19

20

Fleisher case was not reported in the

Well, it isn't your responsibility, in

any event.
MR. MANPEARL:
QUESTION:

No.

But it does seem strange when he is the

principal legal officer of the State and he's not here.
23

MR. MANPEARL:

Well, I know there are many states

24

which have procedures requiring notification.
25

4

California does

1

2
3
4

not have such a procedure.
QUESTION:

It isn't likely that he's unaware, as

Mr. Justice Blackmun has suggested.
MR. MANPEARL:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I have to

5

make the assumption that the Attorney General's Office does

6

read the advance sheets in California and at least is fully

7

aware of the Sears case, although he may not be aware of this

8

case because it is unrecorded.

9

Economic and Business Development in California, which is a

10

branch of the State administration, was aware of this case,

1 1

and they were interested and concerned with it.

12

no communication between either party or, in the Sears case,

13

regarding the Attorney General.

14

However, the Department of

But I know of

The County of Los Angeles in this case places great

15

reliance on the fact that the statute before this Court dis­

16

criminates or makes a distinction between foreign commerce on

17

the one hand and inter- and intrastate commerce on the other.

18

However, a property tax exemption statute by its very defini­

19

tion must discriminate, make a distinction, against those

20
21

22
23
24

25

groups that are not similarly exempted.
The issue which must be resolved is not whether
there's a distinction; obviously there's a distinction.
The question that must be resolved is whether such distinction
is so burdensome, so unreasonable, that it places an undue
burden on interstate or foreign commerce and must be struck
5

1

2

down under the Commerce Clause.
QUESTION:

Is the material involved here in the same

3

relationship in terms of the movement in commerce as material

4

coming from -- let me put it another way:

5

that's moving into California or originating in California,

6

destined for interstate commerce, different in some respects

7

from the material coming from Korea or Japan, coming to rest

8

temporarily in warehouses in California, and then going into

9

interstate commerce?

10
1 1

12
13
14

15

16
17

18
19

20

MR. MANPEARL:

is the material

Well, economics would dictate that

there are different types of materials, there's different
products and commodities that are manufactured in Korea than
are manufactured in California.

But, you know, I assume we

could find an example where there might be some similarity, but
generally different products come to California from overseas
than are manufactured in California.

And to that extent, the

goods.that are manufactured in California do not receive this
exemption, even if they're being shipped out of state, while
the overseas goods would receive the exemption.
QUESTION:

And the exemption was enacted by the

California Legislature, wasn't it?
21

MR. MANPEARL:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

22

QUESTION:

So that whether the Attorney General of

23

California is here or not presumably it's entitled to the
24

benefit of constitutional presumption of validity unless your
25

6

1

opponent can show some constitutional defect .

2
3

MR. MANPEARL:

QUESTION:

And how are California's counties created';

Are they created by the Legislature?

6
7

Yes,

Your Honor.

4

5

Yes; we would agree with that.

MR. MANPEARL:
State.

Yes.

They are --

8

QUESTION:

9

than a creature of the State?

So Los Angeles County is nothing more

MR. MANPEARL:

10

They are creatures of the

That is correct; yes.

It is our

1 1

contention that as a creation of the State it has no constitu­

12

tional standing to attack the statute before this Court today,

13

and I would cite this Court to the decision in Williams v.

14

Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, decided by this Court in~

15

1933.

16

with the instant situation.

17

exemption for the Washington, Baltimore, and Annapolis Electric

18

Railroad Company because it was in receivership and it was

19

important to the state because it was the only link between

20
21

22
23
24

25

I believe that case is analogous, if not on all fours,

Annapolis and the Capital.

There Maryland adopted a tax

The cities of Maryland and Annapo­

lis proceeded to attempt to impose taxes on the railroad,
saying the statute was an unconstitutional exemption under the
Commerce Clause and due, process.
Justice Cardozo, speaking for this Court, stated,
"A municipal , corporation created by a state for the better

7

1

ordering of government has no privileges or immunities under

2

the Federal Constitution which it may invoke in opposition to

3

the will of its creator."

4

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Manpearl, I take it that as far

5

as the courts of California are concerned, they could permit

6

Los Angeles to challenge this statute if they wanted to,

7

and we have no authority to tell the California courts not to

8

entertain a challenge to this statute by Los Angeles County,

9

do we?
MR. MANPEARL:

10
1 1

tion was exactly --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Justice, I think that that ques­

You may be quite right in saying that we

13

have no -- you could be quite right in saying that there is no

14

standing, that Los Angeles would have no standing in this

15

16

17

Court, as a constitutional matter.

could set aside the judgment of a court of appeals in Califor­
nia, and that would leave you behind the 8-ball, wouldn't it?
MR. MANPEARL:

18
19

20
21

22

But I don't know how we

Well, Mr. Justice, I would contend

that standing to raise a federal question is itself a federal
question.
QUESTION:

A Case or Controversy type of thing?

MR. MANPEARL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But not in the state courts.

They don't

23

need cases or controversies.
24

MR. MANPEARL:

That's correct, but the question of

25

8

1

whether a subdivision of the State has standing to raise a

2

federal constitutional question, I believe, must be a consti­

3

tutional question in and of itself.

4

QUESTION:

You mean you're asking us not only to --

5

what you're really asking us to do is to vacate the judgments

6

of the California courts?

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MANPEARL:

9

10

On the standing ground?

Angeles does not have standing to raise a federal constitu­
tional objection.

If it were a state --

1 1

QUESTION:

12

MR. MANPEARL:

13

In a state court, even?
In a state court or a federal court;

yes.
QUESTION:

14

15

On the ground that the County of Los

Even though you have named the County as

a defendant?
MR. MANPEARL:

16

Well, we sued the vCounty for a refund

The County defended on a number of grounds.

didn't grant an exemption, and a number of others.
courts

They

The state

ruled against the County on all grounds except the

federal question, the federal question being the Commerce
Clause issue.
QUESTION: If we can segregate these issues, as Justice
Blackmun has implied,

how can you say they're a party for one

purpose but not for other purposes?
9

1

MR. MANPEARL:

Well, we're not saying that they're

2

not a party.

3

ly have an interest.

4

constitutional law, they have no right to raise a federal con­

5

stitutional objection to a statute on a ground in which they

6

have no direct interest whatsoever.

We believe they are a proper party, they obvious­

QUESTION:

7

What we're saying as a matter of federal

Well, isn't that a question of state law?

8

Suppose the state statute said specifically that the counties

9

who are enforcing state property tax laws can -- suppose the

10

statute specifically gave the counties standing to challenge

11

the state taxes, state statutes in the state courts, would you

12

be making the same argument here?

13
14

15

16
17

18
19

I think you would make the

same argument as far as your being able to come here; we might
not recognize standing.

But I don't know how you could argue

that as a matter of state law the County couldn't challenge
the State.
MR. MANPEARL:
pass a statute.

I don't know whether they could or not

I don't think they could, although that's not

our specific situation.
QUESTION:

Well, in effect, the California courts re­

20
21

jected your standing claim and they said -MR. MANPEARL:

Yes.

22

QUESTION:

-- ad a matter of California or any other

23

law, at least as a matter of California law, Los Angeles County
24

has standing.
25

10

1

QUESTION:

It's

-just, like saying, a state saying

2

that in our state a taxpayer suit can raise a federal constitu­

3

tional issue.

4

of state law, although a taxpayer as such might not have

5

standing as a matter of federal law in the federal court, or

6

specifically this Court.

And that would be wholly acceptable as a matter

7

MR. MANPEARL:

8

QUESTION:

9

10
1 1

12

suits.

Isn't this the same analogy?
Mr. Justice --

And many states do recognize taxpayer

The federal courts, generally speaking, do not.
MR. MANPEARL:

But I believe they do under state law.

You could have -QUESTION:

But a taxpayer can raise under state law

13

that recognizes taxpayer suits any sort of federal constitu­

14

tional claims.

15

MR. MANPEARL:

I believe that they cannot.

I be­

16

lieve it's analogous to the Williams v. Mayor and City of

17

Baltimore, where this

18

raise such a federal constitutional question in this Court.

19

QUESTION:

Court said that the cities could not

Mr. Manpearl, it seems to me that that

20

you may be arguing against your client's interest, because if

21

there is no federal jurisdiction to entertain a federal claim,

22

maybe we have a duty to dismiss the appeal, and maybe we

23
24

25

should look at your adversary's argument for that.

It seems

to me you've taken opposite positions on the case.
MR. MANPEARL:

No, let me very briefly address that
11

1

question, Hr. Justice.

2

generally you have an appellee arguing there is no standing,

3

and relief in those circumstances is to dismiss the action.

4

Where you have an appellant arguing that there is no standing

5

to raise a particular defense --

6
7

QUESTION:

Well, you're arguing there is no proper

federal question presented in this case --

8

MR. MANPEARL:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

I don't think that's the case, because

Right.

I --

-- which a federal court has power to

decide, isn't that correct?
MR. MANPEARL:

I believe there is a federal question

12

and that federal question is the issue, the very issue of whe­

13

ther a county has standing to raise a federal question.

14

15

16
17

18
19

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Who presents the federal question to us?

MR. MANPEARL:

The County of Los Angeles.

Well, we

-- the appellant has presented the federal question of whether
or not the County has the ability to raise a federal constitu­
tional provision as a defense.

However, I think that the ques­

tion of standing, the question of the County's interest in this
litigation is really as relevant or perhaps more relevant to
the question of whether there has been a Commerce Clause vio­
lation at all.

I think it goes at the very heart of this

very issue before the Court.
23

Because, if we look at the cases that have come be­
24

fore this Court in recent years under the Commerce Clause,
25

12

1

in every case the question has been the extent of the burden

2

of interference with commerce.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. MANPEARL:

But that goes to the merits.
That goes -- yes.

I was saying,

5

Mr. Justice, that I believe this question of the County's in­

6

terest in the litigation goes not only to the standing question

7

which I've argued, but I believe it goes to the merits of the

8

Commerce Clause question itself.
QUESTION:

9

If the standing question is resolved in

10

your favor and, as Justice Stevens has suggested, we find that

1 1

the County has no standing to challenge a state statute, we

12

don't then go further and decide the merits of the case.
MR. MANPEARL:

13

Yes, Mr. Justice.

I would agree with

14

that.

At that point I think it would be appropriate for this

15

Court to reverse the holding of the Court of Appeal of Cali­

16

fornia.

17

QUESTION:

How would we do that?

18

QUESTION:

How could we do that?

19

QUESTION:

We could just dismiss; we would just have

20

to dismiss and leave the judgment against you.
MR. MANPEARL:

21
22
23
24

25

a plaintiff an

I would submit that that would leave

appellant in the position of Walter Fleisher

Company without relief, to an improperly raised federal ques­
tion.

I believe where an appellant is entitled -QUESTION:

You're really saying one party to the
13

1

controversy has a forum and the other party doesn't.

2

what you're saying?

3

MR. MANPEARL:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

Is that

I believe

4

we're saying that the very issue, the very issue of who may

5

raise a federal question is a federal question itself, and

6

you can resolve that issue in favor of the appellant, and re­

7

to raise a federal Commerce Clause question.

14

standing, and therefore we wouldn't decide them.

15

We have simply said there was not sufficient

MR. MANPEARL:

Well, I believe, Mr. Justice, you

16

could do the same in this case, but the form of relief would

17

then have to take a reversal.

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

It could be a vacation.

You'd vacate the

judgment because you would argue that the state courts had no
jurisdiction to decide the federal question -MR. MANPEARL:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION:

despite the fact that under state law

--

the County would have power to challenge the statute.
MR. MANPEARL:

Well, I think the state court has

ruled on a question of federal constitutional law.
14

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. MANPEARL:

3

QUESTION:

4

And a question of standing?
Yes.

But we are not bound under federal law

by their rulings as to standing.

5

MR. MANPEARL:

I would agree with that, Mr. Justice;

6

yes, sir.

If I may proceed to the merits of the Commerce

7

Clause question itself, I think this case stands in contrast

8

to the numerous cases that have come before this Court in the

9

last ten years on the Commerce Clause.

I think in the cases

10

that have come before this Court, the major distinguishing

1 1

factor is that in every single case we had a party standing

12

before this Court saying, I have been injured by the Commerce

13

Clause violation.
In this case the County of Los Angeles is not saying,

14

15

I have been injured by the Commerce Clause violation.

16

the County of Los Angeles is losing tax money.

17

have an interest. They are not, however, an injured party under

18

the Commerce Clause violation.

19

20
21

24

25

Clearly

They clearly

They are the champion of some

hypothetical manufacturers that are not receiving a similar
exemption.

They are saying, we are protecting the rights of

others albeit we are doing it so we can save taxes or collect
more tax money.

They are championing somebody else and that,

I would submit, is a major distinction between all the cases
that have troubled this Court in the last ten years.
QUESTION:

You think they're not doing both?
15

1

MR. MANPEARL:

I don't believe they are saying, we

2

are a victim of the Commerce Clause violation.

3

champion for someone else.

4

distinction between cases that have come before this court,

5

like Lewis v. BT Investments, where you had Florida trying to

6

prevent out-of-state investment advisors, and you had before

7

this Court a New York corporation saying, Florida can't keep

8

us out.

9

They are the

And I would submit, that's a major

In Raymond Motor Transport you had an interstate

10

transport carrier coming before this Court and saying, I'm in­

1 1

jured by the statutes of Wisconsin which prevent trucks that

12

are over 55 feet in length; I'm injured.

13

at the statute and said, not only was there no basis for the

14

statute, but there was a favoritism of Wisconsin truckers vis-

15

16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

And this Court lookec

a-vis out-of-state truckers.
QUESTION:

What if the trucking company had simply

been a subsidiary and a creature of the State of Wisconsin?
MR. MANPEARL:
QUESTION:

You mean, involved in a --

Supposing Wisconsin decided, we're going

to socialize our trucking industry, and the trucking company
was simply an arm or a creature of the State of Wisconsin,
and it didn't like what — it lost the fight in the Wisconsin
Legislature and so it came here?
MR. MANPEARL:

I think you would have -- similarly,

you would have a case where somebody is injured, somebody is
16

1

fighting.

You would have a case similar to Reeves v. State,

2

where the South Dakota Cement Commission attempted to sell

3

their proprietary product only to South Dakota manufacturers

4

or users.

5

saying, I am injured by the Commerce Clause violation, I am

6

the victim.

7

But you would have before this Court a party

I think you've had that in every case.

QUESTION:

But in my hypothetical the. person who

8

would be saying it is a creature of the state just like the

9

Baltimore case in 1933.

10

MR. MANPEARL:

Mr. Justice, I agree that that would

11

certainly go to the standing question again.

12

I think the merits would be no different.

13

issue, you would have the same problem you have here.

14

would have a creature of the state attacking the state statute,

15

In Reeves v. State you had no such problem, because it was

16

the Wyoming consumer that was objecting to the Commerce Clause

17

inj ury.

18

As to the merits,

On the standing

My analogy was not as to the standing question but

as to the merits themselves.

20

party before this Court that is saying, look, I'm the victim

21

of this Commerce Clause violation, I am being injured because

22

of something the State of California has done to interfere and

23

burden commerce.

24

25

QUESTION:

On the merits we don't have a

But that's the meaning of standing, what

you have just said.
17

1

MR. MANPEARL:

I totally agree, but I also would

2

submit that such considerations go equally to the merits of

3

the Commerce Clause question, because ultimately, assuming

4

that this Court finds against me on the standing question,

5

that simply gets us to the merits of the case.

6

merits of the case I would submit that we still must find under

7

all of the decisions of this Court in the last ten years , we

8

must find, first, whether there is a burden on interstate

9

commerce.

Now, on the

And if the Court finds that there is a burden on

10

interstate commerce, that burden then has to be balanced

1 1

against the state interest, the state needs, and the Commerce

12

Clause considerations for free and unhindered commerce among

13

the states and foreign countries.

14

tion of the county's interest goes as much to the merits as

15

anything else, because without a party standing before this

16

Court saying, I am injured, I have been hurt, where is the

17

burden on interstate commerce?

18

Angeles shown a burden as the regional stock exchanges did in

19

Boston Stock Exchange v. the Tax Commissioner?

20
21

22
23
24

25

And I submit that the ques­

Where has the County of Los

Where is the

That is correct.

It is an exemption

the Court also did not address itself to the inter-intrastate

25

39

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. HICKOK:

Right.
It would be a very similar argument.

3

Now, I can't see the State simply defending a lawsuit and

4

raising that as an affirmative defense because the State

5

through the Legislature has the power to repeal and revise

6

the statutes.

was unconstitutional and the State then, because the tax col­

10

lection people are supposed to listen to the Attorney General,

1 1

they don't give the exemption.
MR. HICKOK:

12

That's true.

They would have a very

13

similar argument to ours, and I think that the State, also --

14

the State is in a little bit different position from public

entities.

16

regarding standing could and probably would be raised by the

17

State.

Why is the State in a different position

from the County in the context of this case?
MR. HICKOK:

However, the same issues and the same arguments

I'm talking about the State's authority.

First of all, under the Civil Rights Act it is not a person.
Second of all, the State has the authority not to appropriate
funds to pay damages.

The counties have no such luxury.

The counties can be held strictly liable, by my Catch-22
analysis.

That's an aside and that should not enter too much
40

into the decision in this case.
I would just like to conclude at this point by saying

that the case is a very important one.

QUESTION:

Even though we're public officials who are

MR. HICKOK:

That's true because they can always

justify their actions on a defense of the state statute. They
relied on a previously valid state statute.

Therefore they

are not going to have any individual liability.

MR. MANPEARL:

You have two minutes

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think Mr. Hickok has placed incorrect emphasis on

15

the distinction between interstate goods or intrastate and

16

foreign goods.

17

of whether or not California is discriminating, not against

18

different types of goods, but is attempting protectionist

19

legislation.

20
21

23

25

I think the real distinction is in the questior

Is it attempting to isolate itself?

I would refer this Court to the language of Phila­
delphia v. New Jersey, in which the Court said, "The opinions
of the Court through the years have reflected an alertness to
the evils of economic isolation and protectionism."
The Court went on:

"The critical inquiry therefore

must be directed to determining whether Chapter 363 is
42

basically a protectionist measure.

And don't you have to just say that the

State is empowered to make that kind of a discrimination?
MR. MANPEARL:

Yes, I agree, Mr. Justice, and I sub­

mit that the Court is empowered to make such discrimination --

13

QUESTION:

The State is.

14

MR. MANPEARL:

The State is.

-- the State is, unless it violates

15

equal protection standards, is an unreasonable classification.

about State attempts at protectionism, at isolation.

Yes, Mr. Justice, I agree that in

virtually every case decided by this Court in the last five
years, more, there have been protectionist overtones, a State
attempt to isolate itself in some economic manner to benefit
its citizens, its industry vis-a-vis out-of-state industry.
We do not have protectionist measures here.

There is no

attempt by California to isolate itself or its businesses.
The exemption is granted evenhandedly to anybody who wishes
to import foreign commodities, or export.
