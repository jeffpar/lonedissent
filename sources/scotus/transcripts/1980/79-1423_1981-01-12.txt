ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN R. VOGELER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

10

MR. VOGELER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

please the Court:
The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company is

11

one of 1,95.7 legal reserve life insurance companies that as of

12

January 1, 1980, were licensed to do business in one of the 50

13

states or the District of Columbia.

14

incorporated as a stock company in 1888 and in 1948 became a

15

mutual company.

16

17

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

Western and Southern was

At January 1 of 1981 it had assets in excess

of $3 billion, and life insurance in force of over $14 billion
and thus according to Best's Insurance Reports, it ranks
25th in size of companies and 45th of companies in size of
life insurance in force.

It's licensed to do business in 41

states, including the State of California.
It obtained the certificate of authority to do busi­
ness in California as of July 1, 1956, and has carried on its
business under that certificate of authority granted in 1956
for the last 25 years.

The California constitutional provi­

sions and the retaliatory tax laws of California, when Western
25

3

1

and Southern became qualified to do business there, levied a

2

tax upon out-of-state insurors which was called a retaliatory

3

tax if the state from which the foreign insuror to California

4

came levied a higher tax on California insurors doing business

5

in those foreign states than it did upon its own insurors.

6

And when the State Legislature implemented that statute in

7

1959, Western and Southern went to court, and it was deter­

8

mined in the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 1962 that no

9

retaliatory tax could be assessed against Western and Southern

10

under the California constitutional provision and law then in

1 1

effect because the State of Ohio did not levy higher taxes on

12

13
14

15
16

17

18
19

foreign insurance companies doing business in Ohio than they
did on foreign insurance companies coming into the State from
outside.
However, in November, 1964, the California constitu­
tion was amended to authorize a retaliatory tax on out-of-state
insurors in California merely when the state of origin of that
insurance company levied a tax on foreign insurance companies
that was higher than California levied.
QUESTION:

Now, in using this term retaliatory

20

throughout, how would you distinguish that from the traditional
21

reciprocity statute?
22

MR. VOGELER:

Reciprocity, Your Honor, is a situation

23

in which one state recognizes and defers to legislation or
24

some comity in another state.
25

4

QUESTION:

1

2

Well, as it's typically, we'll treat your

corporations the same way you treat ours, isn't it?
MR. VOGELER:

3

That's correct, Your Honor.

That is

4

not what our situation here is, because California does not

5

lower its tax if a foreign state has a lower tax.

6

raised their tax up to a foreign state's tax.

7

reciprocity. But this is what, of course, the Attorney General

8

of California would like this Court to believe.

9

pand on the fact that this is not reciprocity, this is not

It merely

There is no

on California corporations, and levies a higher tax on the

12

foreign insurance company doing business in California.

22

California taxes, whether or not Ohio discriminates

The California constitutional amendment in 1964 had
the effect of levying this tax on out-of-state insurors when
the out-of-state, the foreign state of origin of the company
doing business in California had a higher tax rate than
California did.

Now, California's tax rate, actually, is

higher than 32 other states.
than California's.

But Ohio's tax rate is higher

So the question of the validity of this

California retaliatory tax is therefore at issue in this case.
We claim, and the Los Angeles County Superior Court found,
that this kind of a tax, which he referred to as a comparative
retaliatory tax where the tax burdens of different states were

23

compared, is unconstitutional.
24

QUESTION:

Mr. Vogeler?

25

5

1

MR. VOGELER:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist?

In the opinion of the California Court

3

of Appeal, the taxes are variously referred to as discrimina­

4

tory, comparative, and now you characterize it as retaliatory.
MR. VOGELER:

5

Yes, Your Honor.

The discriminatory

6

tax is one which levies a tax when the foreign state discrimi­

7

nates.

8

is one that is levied when the foreign state merely levies

9

a higher burden.

The retaliatory tax, the comparative retaliatdry tax,

The discriminatory tax is one which is

10

aimed at the foreign state which levies higher taxes on for­

11

eign companies than on its own companies.

12

discriminatory retaliatory tax.

That is no longer the tax we

13

have in California, Your Honor.

We have the comparative tax,

14

the comparative retaliatory tax which merely measures the

15

comparative tax burdens in Ohio and California.

16

the tax which is in effect in most of the states of the Union.

17

We claim that this tax in California is invalid, violating not

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

That Is the anti-

And this is

only the Interstate Commerce Clause, but also the Due Process
and Equal Protection of the Law.

And this is also what the

judge found in the trial court.
Now, the Court of Appeal reversed that.

The Court

of Appeal reversed It on the basis of its understanding of the
decisions by this Court in Prudential v. Benjamin and Pruden­
tial v. Hobbs.
QUESTION:

but it is only one tax that we're talking

25

6

1

about?
MR. VOGELER:

2

It is one tax, Your Honor.

It is a

3

retaliatory tax.

A return is filed and an amount is paid.

4

It is a retaliatory tax.

5

all insurance companies pay.

6

which all of the insurance companies pay.

7

tax determined by the use of a retaliatory form which measures

8

the tax burden of California against the tax burden of the

9

state of origin of the incoming company.
QUESTION:

10

It is not the premiums tax which
It is not the real property tax,

Well, what if the tax in the other juris­

11

diction on California companies is lower?

12

keeps its tax the way it is?
MR. VOGELER:

13
14

17

18
19

20
21

22

California still

California still levies its normal tax,

It does not reciprocate, Your Honor.
Now, there is another issue in this case and that's

15
16

It is a retaliatory

another provision of California law in which California grant­
ed, a law that is now repealed as of 1977, granted a credit
against the premiums tax for all California insurors for
their real property taxes that they paid on their home office
buildings in California.

They also granted a credit to foreign

companies against their gross premium tax if the foreign com­
pany had an office in California and occupied 75 percent or
more of the office.

23

QUESTION:

But that washes out if the other one goes

24

one way?
25

7

1

MR. VOGELER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is

2

what the California Court of Appeal has said, but that is not,

3

however, Your Honor, what the local court, the Los Angeles

4

Superior Court, said.

5

QUESTION:

But that's been repealed, hasn't it?

6

MR. VOGELER:

It has been repealed, but in all of

7

the years in issue in this case it's presently in effect.

8

affects the years we have before the Court.

9

10

QUESTION:

It

It affects the judgment in this case?

MR. VOGELER:

Yes, Your Honor.

The Los Angeles

1 1

Superior Court also found that that was an undue discrimina­

12

tion, it violated due process, and it violated equal protec­

13

tion for the California companies to get this credit against

14

their premiums tax and for a company like Western and Southern

15

who did have an office building -- it's a lovely office build­

16
17

18
19

20
21

22

ing on Wilshire Boulevard which it spent a lot of money for
and pays a lot of taxes for, but It doesn't get the same credit
that the California companies get, because Western and Sou­
thern didn't occupy 75 percent of the building, and therefore
was limited to a credit equal to the percentage of its real
property taxes, equal to the percentage of the building occu­
pied by itself.
Now, as Mr. Justice Blackmun has stated, the Court

23

of Appeal of California reversed the Los Angeles County
24

Superior Court, and it is the validity of that reversal which
25

8

1

we are concerned with today.
Now, the legal issues we think are twofold.

2

One,

3

did this Court in Prudential Insurance Company v. Benjamin

4

and Prudential Insurance Company v. Hobbs in 1945 give free

5

rein in 1946 to the states to levy whatever burden they wanted

6

to on insurance companies doing business in interstate com­

7

merce?

8

then did those two cases also authorize the states to violate

9

the due process of law and equal protection as guaranteed by

10

And if that question is answered in the affirmative,

the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution?
QUESTION:

11

12

MR. VOGELER:
QUESTION:

14

I'm sorry; I did not hear, Your Honor.

There was an equal protection issue in

Benj amin.
MR. VOGELER:

16

QUESTION:

17

Well, I will explain where I think --

All right.

MR. VOGELER:

18

19

Well, the equal protection issue was in

Benjamin, wasn't it?

13

15

We submit --

-- where I think that there may not

have been the equal protection issue that is before Court.
QUESTION:

The words were there, anyway.

20

MR. VOGELER:

The words may have been there, Your

21

Honor.

Correct.

22

QUESTION:

And Congress does have power under

23

Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enact legislation
24

carrying out the Amendment, does it not?
25

9

MR. VOGELER:

1

That is correct, Your Honor, but this

2

Court has said it has not done that in the McCarran-Ferguson

3

Act.

4

California retaliatory tax to be discriminatory, and nobody

5

says that it isn't discriminatory.

6

Attorney General of California, nor any of the amici on their

7

side say that this isn't discriminatory.

8

this Court authorized this discrimination when it interpreted

9

the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1946.

12

13
14

Neither the appellee, the

What they say is that

Now, what they say really is that this type of dis­

10
11

There isn't any question that the trial court found this

crimination was approved by this Court in Hobbs, Prudential
Insurance Company v. Hobbs.

Now, the Hobbs case, decided on

June 10, '46, before any of the members of this Court had come
to the Court either as Justices or as clerks, said as follows:
"The entire case -- "

15

QUESTION:

16

But not long, though.

MR. VOGELER:

17

A couple of years.

"Appeals for the Supreme Court of Kansas.

June 10,

18

1946.

Per curiam, the judgments are affirmed.

Prudential

19

Insurance Company v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408; Robertson v.
20

California, 328 U.S. 440."
21

That's the entire language of this Court.

Now, let's

22

go down below to the Kansas Supreme Court.

There were 16

23

insurance companies who had cases involved in the court
24

entitled, "In re Kansas, in re insurance tax cases, at 160
25

were a fireman's relief fund tax, a premiums tax, and a retal­

iatory tax.

7

There were three types of taxes involved.

And what did the Kansas Supreme Court
Here's what they said

Our statutes pertaining to insurance were not

rendered void by the decision of the Supreme Court of the

10

United States in United States v. Southeastern Underwriters

11

Association."

Second, "Congress did not exceed its powers in

12
13
14

passing Public Law No. 15 of the 79th Congress, First Session.
That's the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
And third, "Mandamus will not be allowed to compel

That was their first premise of law.

an executive officer" -- they wanted a license to be issued.
"Mandamus will not be allowed to compel an executive officer
to do something contrary to a statute unless it is is clear
that the statute is void."
So the memorandum opinion issued by this Court in

20

Hobbs could do no more than affirm the foregoing propositions
21

of law.
22

What did the jurisdictional statement

23

raise as an issue?

There was a retaliatory tax there?
There was a retaliatory tax, Your

However, the Kansas Supreme Court said in

who are doing business as native companies."

So there is no

retaliation, there is no discrimination -- pardon me, Your
Honor.

There is no discrimination that was found to be

existing in the Kansas Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

Are you sure there weren't discrimina­

tions among foreign companies?
MR. VOGELER:

The Kansas Supreme Court, Your Honor,

in that case -QUESTION: No, that isn't what you said just now.
I'll put it to you another way.

Non-Kansas and non-Texas companies. Other

MR. VOGELER:

MR. VOGELER:

Yes, Your Honor.

The question is not

21

whether there is discrimination -22

QUESTION:

And the Supreme Court of the United States

23

said that was quite legal to do.
24

MR. VOGELER:

It has been interpreted that way,

California Attorney General, Your Honor.

You were going to get to that, so go

ahead.
MR. VOGELER:

What I wanted to say about both Benja­

min and Hobbs is that in the Benjamin case we were dealing with
a South Carolina premium statute.

We were not dealing in

Benjamin with a retaliatory statute.

So there was no question

in the Benjamin case of the validity of retaliatory tax laws.
QUESTION:

No, but there was a tax which for purposes

of decision was assumed to discriminate against interstate com­
panies as opposed to South Carolina companies, because it was
levied only on the premiums paid or collected by the out-ofstate companies.
MR. VOGELER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

However -•

23

QUESTION:

But that was done in an interstate com­

24

merce context.
25

14

1

MR. VOGELER:

That is also true, Your Honor.

The

2

doctrine of Lincoln Life Insurance Company v. Read was still

3

in effect, and the question is whether or not a corporation

4

could be charged coming into a state a different fee or a

5

different tax than a creature of that own state.

6

pany is coming into a state standing on the threshold, it may

7

be valid for a corporate tax to be placed on that corporation

8

which is higher or different from the tax that is levied on

9

the local corporation.

When a com­

Now, we are getting into somewhat of a

10

discussion of the unconstitutional conditions

1 1

this Court I believe is now fostering, and it may be that the

12

Lincoln Life Insurance Company case v. Read may not again be

13

decided in the same way that it was decided at that time.
But this is the concept that was involved in the

14

15
16

Benjamin case, namely, a company coming into the State of
Carolina was subjected to a higher tax than Carolina companies

Was it argued in that case that that

violated the Equal Protection Clause?

I thought you suggested

to Mr. Justice White that it was so argued, and I'm not sure
it was.
QUESTION:

Well, whether it was or not, didn't Mr.

Justice Rutledge say it didn't violate the Equal Protection
Clause either?
QUESTION:

Did he say that or did he say the

McCarran Act didn't violate the Equal Protection Clause?

MR. VOGELER:

Your Honor; yes.

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

13

MR. VOGELER:

I confess to the Court that my position

14

is stronger with my second point which is, on the Fourteenth

Amendment, Due Process, and Equal Protection of the Laws.

16

In any event, we suggest that this Court is the final arbiter

of the meaning and effect of its decisions.

lieve the California Court of Appeal

As I say, we be­

interpreted Prudential

v. Benjamin and Prudential v. Hobbs incorrectly, but if we are
wrong we urge this Court to reexamine those cases and to dis­
tinguish them on the basis that the McCarran-Ferguson Act
does not authorize discriminatory taxation against interstate
commerce where such discrimination constitutes a denial of
Equal Protection of Laws.

Apart from the Commerce clause,

Equal Protection of Laws.

Then as our second -16

QUESTION:

1

You're not asking us to reconstrue or

2

reexamine the construction of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, but

3

simply to say, contrary to what we said some years ago, that

4

that Act does constitute any violation of Equal Protection of

5

the Laws?

6

MR. VOGELER:

No, Your Honor, I am saying that I

7

want you to distinguish your former treatment of the McCarran-

8

Ferguson Act so that it does not apply to the other constitu­

9

tional guarantees.

I feel that if the McCarran-Ferguson Act

10

takes away all protections to foreign insurance companies of

1 1

the Interstate Commerce Clause, which is what the Attorney

12

General of California would have you say and what you may al­

13

ready have said, then it seems to me it is particularly im­

14

portant that this Court be zealous in reserving and protecting

15
16

17

18

20
21

22

the only remaining rights that there are to these foreign in­
surance companies under the Constitution, and those are the
rights guaranteed to them under the fourteenth Amendment:

Due

Process, Equal Protection -QUESTION:

Mr. Vogeler, in your equal protection ar­

gument, has the California statute had any impact on tax laws
in Ohio, to reduce them or -- ?
MR. VOGELER:
QUESTION:

I believe it has not, Your Honor.

Are they the same tax, same rate of tax,

23

whether it's a domestic or foreign corporation?
24

MR. VOGELER:

Oh, no, Your Honor.

25

17

Ohio levies on

1

foreign companies coming into the State a premiums tax of

2

2.5 percent.

QUESTION:

3
4

Well, what's Ohio do as to domestic cor­

porations?
MR. VOGELER:

5

6

California levies a tax of 2.35 --

With request to domestic corporations,

Your Honor, there is a complicated formula and it --

7

QUESTION: Different from the foreign?

8

MR. VOGELER:

9

10

-- has been held that the use of that

formula, in three different cases, meant that Ohio did not
discriminate against foreign insurance companies in Ohio.
QUESTION:

1 1

But the California laws had no impact on

12

reducing the tax rates for either domestic or foreign corpo­

13

rations?

14

15
16

17

18

19

20
21

MR. VOGELER:

No, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor.

And

that is, of course, one of the things that we discuss here,
because we feel that contrary to what the Attorney General
would have you believe, and contrary to what the amici in sup­
port of the California statute would have you believe, this
type of legislation, this retaliatory legislation does not
promote comity.

It doesn't promote equalhanded treatment,

evenhanded treatment.

It doesn't promote even taxation of

foreign corporations.
Let's look at the California law.

They say that

17 states only levy higher taxes on foreign insurance companies
than California, and therefore it indicates that there's a
18

1

great leveling of taxes on foreign corporations.

But 31

2

states levy a lower tax on foreign insurance companies than

3

California does, so that when those companies which are

4

created in California come into any one of the other 32 states

5

they have a retaliatory tax to pay.

6

about what California's doing.

7

comity is because you've got Oklahoma.

8

highest tax of all, four percent.

9

that does business in any other state pays a retaliatory tax.

So there’s nothing magic

The only time you've got
In Oklahoma that's the

So every Oklahoma company

10

In California, Western and Southern pays a tax of the

1 1

difference between 2.35, the California rate, and the Ohio

12

rate, 2.5, or 0.15 of a percent of their premium income.

13

Oklahoma pays a 1.65 percent, companies from Oklahoma pay a

14

1.65 percent of premium tax, eleven times what Ohio pays.

MR. VOGELER:

Ohio pays.

QUESTION:

I see.

6

MR. VOGELER:

If we look at the Exhibit B in the

7

Jerome Hellerstein brief which lists all the tax rates of all

8

the states, we could come up with all sorts of combinations

of what kinds of taxes are paid by the various companies from

QUESTION: And your due process argument emphasizes
what, Mr. Vogeler?
MR. VOGELER:

The due process argument, Your Honor,

emphasizes that the mere incorporation of a state in another
state is no warrant or authority for the imposition of dis­
criminatory taxation.

And you, Mr. Justice Brennan, said

that yourself in the Allied Stores case

and I think your

language discussed the matter of our federalism, the comity that
we have between

states,

and you said, our Constitution is an
You referred to the common and

continuing problem of constitutional interpretation, of ad­
21

justing the demands of individual states to regulate and tax
22

enterprises in light of the multi-state nature of our
23

federation.

The Equal Protection Clause, among its other

24

roles, operates to maintain this principle of federalism.
25

20

1

And you pointed out that the Wheeling Steel case held a tax

2

law unconstitutional because it discriminated against an out-

3

of-state company, whereas the Allied Stores case was held

4

valid because Ohio was discriminating against its own citi­

5

zens in favor of a foreign corporation.

I would like to reserve five minutes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY G. LADDISH, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

9

MR. LADDISH:

10
1 1

Mr. Laddish.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think first we should clear the record as to one

12
13

question which I do not think is determinative of this case

14

or actually, strictly relevant to the case.

15

raised many times by the other side and in an effort to ap­

16

parently color the case in the favor of Western and Southern,

17

and that is the question as to whether Ohio law itself dis­

18

criminates against foreign insurors.
Now, from the presentation we have heard today and

19

20

21
22
23
24

25

But it's been

the presentation in the briefs, one would understand that Ohio
does not discriminate against out-of-state insurors when they
come in.

This is not the case.
I would draw attention to the brief filed by the

American Insurance Association and their fellow associations,
and particularly the Appendix A of that brief.
21

There is set

1

forth the Ohio statutes which set forth what Mr. Vogeler has

2

characterized as this complex formula as far as Ohio domestic

3

insurors.

4

insurance companies coming into Ohio will be taxed at a rate

5

of 2.5 percent of their premiums' measure.

6

clear under Section 5729.03.

7

Appendix.

That's certainly

That's on page 2a of this

For domestic insurors, Sections 5725.18 and .19

8
9

It's clear, as Mr. Vogeler says, that foreign

cover the tax that is to be charged.

There there is a choice

10

excuse me, it's not a choice; there are alternatives given

1 1

far as how the tax will be computed for an Ohio insurance

12

company.

13

only basis upon which

14

state's companies will be taxed.

15

multiply the revenue, the premiums measured by the 8-1/3.

16

figure that's given in subparagraph (b) of 5725.18, multiply

17

the premiums measure

18

result again by the .03 that is given in the 5725.19, you end

19

up with exactly the same 2.5 percent rate that's charged out-

One of those alternatives is the alternative, the
California companies or any other

of-state insurors.

21

given to the domestic companies.

25

That's only one of the alternatives that's

5725.18 says you shall take the lesser of two alter­

22

24

It works out so that if you

by that 8-1/3, and then multiply that

20

23

as

natives.

The

other alternative is based on the surplus and

capital of the company.

You arrive at a figure and multiply

that by the .03 that is given in Section 5725.19.

QUESTION:

But in any event you've told us that the

Ohio tax is irrelevant?

3

MR. LADDISH:

4

QUESTION:

5

6

They are irrelevant, Your Honor.

What we're concerned with here is the

California tax?
MR. LADDISH:

California tax; that is true.

7

My point, however, Your Honor, I think it's as important in

8

that it colors the arguments from the other side, including

9

the Solicitor General's brief, emphasizes in its question pre­

10

sented and several times during the course of the brief, in­

11

cluding four separate times on page 10 of its brief, that the

12

Ohio tax is nondiscriminatory and there is a very serious

13

question in my mind from reading in that brief as to whether

14

15
16
17

18
19

the Solicitor General would be in this case if he understood
what Ohio law actually provides.
QUESTION:

But General Laddish, is it not true that

the discrimination in Ohio is between domestic companies and
all foreign insurance companies?
MR. LADDISH:
QUESTION:

That is true.

Whereas in California the discrimination

20

is, say, between an Oklahoma insurance company and an Ohio
21

insurance company and a Georgia insurance company; might pay
22

three different tax rates?
23

MR. LADDISH:

Yes, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

Quite a different problem.

25

23

1

MR. LADDISH:

2

QUESTION:

3

Right.

That is, the former claim that we had

in the Benjamin case.
MR. LADDISH:

4

But, Your Honor, I think where we need

5

to keep things straight is the fact of

6

about the basic premiums tax law or talking about the retalia­

7

tory tax law.

8

basic Ohio law.

Here, the Ohio law I'm referring to is the

QUESTION:

9

whether we're talking

I understand.

But the issue we have, as

10

I understand the equal protection issue we have, is whether

11

California may treat a group of insurance companies from dif­

12

ferent states differently because they're from different

13

states, not a distinction between local and foreign corpora­

14

tions?
MR. LADDISH:

15
16

move on to the -QUESTION:

17

18
19

20

That's correct, Your Honor, and I will

And while I've interrupted you, would the

issue be the same if, say, we thought of it in terms of indi­
vidual income tax and the State of Virginia used a retaliatory
scheme

against, say, Maryland and West Virginia, and so that

a Maryland citizen working in Virginia paid one tax rate to
21

Virginia and a West Virginia citizen working across the,
22

commuting across, might pay a different rate.

Is that the

23

same issue?
24

MR. LADDISH:

Well, it would certainly be a different

25

24

1

case, Youk Honor, because there's -QUESTION: But in equal protection terms, would it

2
3

be the same issue?
MR. LADDISH:

4

5

Equal protection terms, when we get

into that, it would be --

6

QUESTION:

The idea being that --

7

MR. LADDISH:

-- very similar, and yet you cannot

8

ignore the fact that here we have an interstate business, that

9

the business of insurance is an interstate, is in interstate

10

commerce, where the Congress has removed the Commerce Clause

11

-- upon the state.

13
14

all the Commerce Clause issues out of the case.

17

18
19

20

21

MR. LADDISH:

24

But remaining, Your Honor, is what is

left, and what can the states do to perhaps take up the slack
a bit and protect this interstate commerce on their own be­
half?

And there is where you find a very strong interest here

of the retaliatory tax in trying to encourage interstate in­
surance commerce and in trying to keep the rates somewhat uni­
form and -QUESTION:

22
23

We just have

an equal protection issue.

15
16

I'm assuming the McCarran Act has taken

California is trying to encourage inter­

state insurance commerce by charging out-of-state companies
more?
MR. LADDISH:

That's what I have to convince you of,

25

25

1

Your Honor, and I think --

2

QUESTION:

Well, may I ask --

3

QUESTION:

I just want to just leave one question,

4

and then I'll be still.

5

that it would not violate the Equal Protection Clause for

6

Virginia to discriminate between Maryland and West Virginia

7

nonresidents working in Virginia, for the same purpose under­

8

lying the statute, to try and induce those states to lower

9

their income tax rates?

10

MR. LADDISH:

Is it the same -- would you contend

Your Honor, I have not considered

1 1

that out of the current context of the case, which I think is

12

a very special case.

13

stances there are privileges and immunities would also be

applying, and this sort of thing.

And we, of course, under those circum­

But in the equal protection

standard, I think this is a very special case because of the
Commerce Clause facts, which I will refer to.
QUESTION:

Mr. Laddish, I just want to be clear in

your response to my brother Stewart a moment ago.

Is it your

position that appellant's equal protection argument is neither
helped nor hurt by whatever the situation may be in Ohio?
MR. LADDISH:

Your Honor --

for purposes of the

California tax, it is not a part of the mechanism that there
must be a determination in Ohio.
QUESTION:

That was changed in 1964.

Well, the reason I asked --

MR. LADDISH:

I think it is to the opinion of

25

this Court as to whether or not -- it certainly, the retalia­

2

tory tax is certainly more than one purpose, which I will be

getting to.

5

that it does indeed exist --

One of the purposes is to counteract discrimina­

QUESTION:

6

The point I was making right now was

Well, what that means to me, Mr. Laddish,

7

is that California's purpose is, if possible, to get Ohio --

8

since we're dealing with Ohio corporations doing business in

9

California -- so to adjust its tax structure as to -- over it,

10

so that you don't have to charge the higher rate, is that

right?
MR. LADDISH:

That's part of it, Your Honor, yes,

15

companies.

25

And the -- also, it's to keep the lid on from Ohio doing

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Vogeler suggested that he did

not think that the California tax had had any impact whatever
on the Ohio tax structure, to change it in any way.

Do you

agree with that?
MR. LADDISH:

There has not been a change in the

Ohio tax since the current California retaliatory tax statutes
came into effect.

Now, whether it has kept the lid on and

kept Ohio from doing more and increasing its insurance tax
rate, I would say that's a very, very good question as to
whether or not Ohio's insurance tax rate on foreign companies
27

1

might be quite a bit greater.

2

QUESTION:

Well, do you think it's a sufficient de­

3

fense for the California tax if the only purpose were to try

4

to get other states to lower theirs?

5

MR. LADDISH:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

You think that's enough of a defense

against -MR. LADDISH:

11

sary to support a tax such as ours.

12

issue, Your Honor, other than just the reducing.

13

I -- and I'll get off this now, as far as the Ohio taxes go,

14

the Court is -- the past practice of the Court has been to

15

take judicial notice of matters in appeals from state courts

16

that that state appellate court could take judicial notice of,

17

and in the current case, I would cite the Court to Section'

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

25

There are these other
The point

452(a) for taking judicial notice of the -- this is Evidence
Code of the State of California -- taking judicial notice of
the Ohio laws, and also Section 452 (c) which permits
California courts to take judicial notice of the official acts
of the executive department of the states involved.

I mention

that one because the amicus, American Insurance Association,
has also lodged with the Court in this document the tax forms
upon which the examiner for the Superintendent of Insurance
28

1

of Ohio, pursuant to the Ohio statute, to 5725.9, has computed

2

Western and Southern's tax liabilities for the past few years.

3

If one follows through this form, one will easily see that

4

Western and Southern itself has paid only 36 percent of the

5

taxes due Ohio that a California company would pay to Ohio

6

under the basic Ohio insurance tax.
Now, Western and Southern has mentioned in its

7

8

briefs the stipulation that we reached as to these earlier

9

California trial court decisions about Ohio law.

I would just

10

merely point out that the mechanics of the California retalia­

11

tory tax means that those decisions were reached on the basis

12

of the level of business Western and Southern was doing in

13

California at that time, and presumably this lower alternative

14

was not available to Western and Southern, would not be avail­

15
16

17

18
19

20

21

able to Western and Southern under those facts for years 1959
and 1960.

Until now there's been nothing in the record to shoi(/

any later years after 1960.
Now, I'll move on from what I have said that's irrel evant to begin with.

The purpose of the California retaliatory

tax is not to raise revenue.

That, as the California courts

have recognized, is purely incidental.
raised is purely incidental.

Any revenue that is

In fact, the more successful the

22

tax is -- as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out -- the less reve­
23

nues will be raised in that .if it were successful those foreign
24

taxes will tend to lower.
25

29

1

Now, that is true because the true purpose, which is

2

a multi-faceted purpose of this tax, is to help California

3

insurance companies attain evenhanded tax treatment when they

4

do business in the other states.

5

everyone's tax level will be the same -QUESTION:

6
7

Are you arguing now Equal Protection or

Commerce or both?
MR. LADDISH:

8
9

If this is fully achieved,

in all the rules.

Right now I am trying to -- I will tie

I really would -- I'm presenting in

10

abstract what the purpose is and what the mechanics are.

And

11

I think if we understand that, then the constitutional rules

12

and standards are easily applied to show the constitutionality

13

of the tax.
The purpose that I mentioned as fully achieved -- if

14

15

it is, then there is no retaliatory tax collectible, and I

16

would point out that the California premiums tax, the basic

17

tax California applies to all insurors, would only have to be

18
19

20

raised 0.01 percent from 2.35 percent to 2.36 percent in order
to take up the slack, if the retaliatory tax were repealed.
So the revenue is purely incidental.
The further purposes of the tax are to counteract

21

22
23
24

25

discrimination between -- internal discrimination of other
states

that California companies might experience, such as

could be experienced in Ohio.

They are to encourage -- retalia

tory taxes are to encourage uniformity of tax burdens throughout
30

1

the United States and thus to encourage interstate insurance

2

commerce.
Now, this is not the purpose that one normally finds

3
4

behind a state tax, although as pointed out in the briefs

5

there are other state statutes and there are federal statutes

6

in the Internal Revenue Code that have similar purposes.

7

The existence of that purpose as being the valid purpose in

8

this case and the relative effectiveness with

9

carried out is demonstrated here by who is supporting the

which it is

10

State of California in this case as to the insurance tax that

1 1

is at issue.

QUESTION:

12

13

MR. LADDISH:

18
19

No, this is the purpose of the

California retaliatory tax.
QUESTION:

16
17

Mr. Laddish, you have dealt at some

length with the purpose of the Ohio tax.

14

15

In addition to the --

Or of the California tax, and ordinarily

in a state tax case it's presumed, you know, one state may
tax income at ten percent, another at 30 percent, and we don't
inquire into why one state chose to tax at ten percent and
another at 30 percent.

So, why is your purpose argument rele­

20
21

vant here?
MR. LADDISH:

Well, It certainly will become clear

22

when we get to the equal protection argument, Your Honor, and
23

also it is I think quite important here because I don't know if
24

your reaction was the same as mine when I first heard of the
25

California retaliatory tax. It was imposed upon some foreign

insurors, and not upon California insurors.

elimination of this tax will indeed disrupt the relative uni­

their tax bills.
QUESTION:

I'm not sure how long it would survive under

the Commerce Clause.

I am not arguing here, although my

sister state Tennessee does argue in its brief that this tax
would be valid under the Commerce Clause without the McCarran
Act, so I don't feel as if I can concede that point and argue
against my co-state.
QUESTION:

However -But you're not arguing that there's

anything unique about insurance, other than the history with
the McCarran Act?

So, in terms of equal protection, it would

be the same with an automobile business or steel business or
whatever it might be?

24

MR. LADDISH:

It depends on exactly what we're

34

grouping in the McCarran Act milieu there.

in this area, then if these California insurance companies

are to avoid this sort of discriminatory taxes

6

that the tax was discriminatory against interstate commerce,

if they're going to try and keep a lid on that it's going to

be up to the states to do it.

9

that this does create a special context even in the equal

that this

And it's important to realize

protection issue in that if the Equal Protection Clause is

11

seen as having a federalistic element, this is a tax that is

12

trying to keep that sort of discrimination and an overburdening

13

of the insurance industry down.

14

QUESTION:

As I understand the Equal Protection

15

principle, it is that that discrimination that would otherwise

16

be impermissible may be justified as rational if the motiva­

17

tion of it is to motivate the legislature of the state from

which the nonresident comes to take some special action.
You discriminate against residents of California and Ohio be­

MR. LADDISH:

Yes, Your Honor, it's very similar to

the case of Hawkins v. Moss that is cited on page 27 of the
American Insurance Association brief.

in this case.

is an Ohio corporation, and so once the

business done by Western and Southern in California and doing
the same type of business, being the same type of company as
Western and Southern, what its burden in Ohio would be.
Now, if that burden is less or the same, there is

20

21

We take -- and this is what happened

no retaliatory tax on Western and Southern.

If that burden Is

more, which the record is clear and there's no dispute here,
the Ohio burden would be more on the California company, then
there is the tax, but only to the extent that the burden would
be more.
37

lower the burden on the California insurors, say to the -- or

give the California insurors the same alternatives that

they're giving to the domestic insurors in Ohio, then the

California retaliatory tax, as long as that Ohio burden was

6

the same or below what California's burden would be, would

disappear.

And I say this is reciprocal action.
QUESTION:

In other words, it wouldn't be enough, as

I understand It, to prevent the application of the California

tax that Ohio increased the rate for both domestic and foreign

companies to the same level, but higher than California?

MR. LADDISH:

It's slightly different, Your Honor,

11

states and Congress have acted together and that it would add

even more strength to the presumption that the state tax

As to the

application of Prudential and the McCarran Act to a substan­
tially similar retaliatory tax is clear through the decision
in Prudential v. Hobbs. So I leave to my briefs the arguments
as to the Commerce clause, unless there are questions of the
Court.
One point is that Congress, if it were unhappy with
the Prudential v. Benjamin case or Hobbs case, or if it were
unhappy with what the states were doing now

as to retaliatory

taxes, could change the system at any time by amending the
McCarran Act or repealing it, or taking over the field itself
of state regulation and taxation of insurance companies.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN R. VOGELER, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT -- REBUTTAL

7

MR. VOGELER:

Thank you.

First, let me say that

8

if we are in error about the Ohio law not discriminating

9

against foreign corporations, it is an error that has been

10

propounded by the California courts which on three different

11

occasions in suits to levy taxes upon Western and Southern

12

because of the Ohio law, found that the Ohio law did not dis­

13

criminate, and those cases are referred to in our brief.

14

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

Now, I don't know what the purpose is for talking
about Western and Southern's income taxes are, and the materia
which has been submitted by the brief for the property
insurors are obviously not Western and Southern tax returns
but they are workups from, perhaps those returns, by employees
of the Ohio Department of Insurance.
The question of discrimination is obvious in this
legislation.

Not only do we have discrimination between

states, we have discrimination within states.

For example,

under the California retaliatory tax law a life insurance
company from Virginia doing business in California pays no
retaliatory tax at all, but a property insurance company from

25

43

t

Virginia doing business in California pays a 0.4 percent of

2

premium retaliatory tax.

3

QUESTION:

Is that equal protection?

What do you do with sun belt non-reci-

4

procitative admissions to the bar?

5

to the bar in California or Arizona or Florida without taking

6

a test, although in most other states, if you've been admitted

7

to practice in one of them, you can get admitted to the other

8

simply on motion.

9

MR. VOGELER:

You can't get admitted

Yes, Your Honor.

As

’in., every case,

10

in every state with respect to attorneys, the jurisdiction of

1 1

the supreme court of the state which has the right to control

12

the practice of law within that state.

13
14

15

16
17

18
19

So I don't think

that the same principle is involved.
QUESTION:

Well, but we're talking about state power

whether it's exercised by a court or by a legislature.
MR. VOGELER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But

we're talking about in that case, I say, police power where
there is a particular interest within the state.

Now what

interest does the State of California have as to what a tax
levy is in the State of Ohio?

I say to you that no state

20

should have to conform its own revenue statutes to the configU'
21

ration of another state.

And this Court has said so also, in

Austin v. New Hampshire.

No state should try to impose its

22
23

insurance tax structure on another state.

A state should be

24

free to levy its insurance taxes on insurance companies in
25

44

1

accordance with its own needs, not because the State of

2

California wants to equalize the taxes all over the country,

3

or wants to equalize taxes among companies that are going to

4

be doing

5

business

there

but are from California.

The discrimination inherent in retaliatory taxation

6

found to exist in the unchallenged findings of the Superior

7

Court of California that it is unconstitutional

8

upheld by this Court.

9

10
11

12

It is fundamentally wrong.
