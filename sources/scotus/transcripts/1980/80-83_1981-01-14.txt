MR . McCREE :

Mr . Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court :
This case presents the question whether the Preside

10
11

of the United States acting through the Secretary of State

12

has the authority to revoke the passport of an American citi-

13

zen whose international travel ·activities concededly ·have

14

caused and will continue to cause serious damage to the

national security and to the foreign policy of the United
States .
The jurisdiction of this Court is found in 28 U.S . C.
2254(1) , and the facts that give rise to this controversy may
be succinctly stated .
For 11 years , from 1957 until 1 968 , respondent, an
American citizen , was employed by the Central Intelligence
Agency in the course of which employment he took an oath which
this Court considered in Snepp recently, not to divulge,
except upon prior approval, any information· gained in the
course of his employment.
3

During the course of his employment he became
2

acquainted with the techniques of intelligence gathering of

3

the Central Intelligence Agency, and learned the identities

4

of many covert operatives who were employed by or utilized

5

by that agency .

6

abroad by the agency .

7

his intention to disrupt and to destroy the Central Intelli-

8

Many of these persons are still employed
In 1974 respondent publicly announced

I'd like to direct the Court 's attention to Footnote

10

2 on page 3 of our brief in which, in an extraordinary press

11

release in London on October 3, 1974, he said -- and I'll

12

just mention the first paragraph:

13

''Today I announced a new campaign to fight the

14

United States CIA wherever it is operating .

15

campaign will have two main functions :

16

expose CIA officers and agents and to take the mea-

17

sures necessary to drive them out of the countries

the United States to have the CIA abolished."

It ' s in an affidavit that was filed

with cross -motions for summary judgment in the district court.

General McCree, when was the respondent

iss ued his passport?
MR . Mc CREE :

3

I believe his passport -- I can ' t

4

answe r that precisely without reference to the record, but

5

his passport was issued, I bel ieve, before he terminated his

6

empl oyment , which would be 1968 , because

Before the issuance of the press

But I can ' t tell you specifically , Mr . Justi ce

Rehnquist .

I can furnish that if it becomes relevant .
The respondent has traveled abroad extensively from

12

his current residence in the Federal Republic of Germany,

13

and is purported to identify CIA agents, employees , and

14

sources in several countries .

15

in a number of understandable consequences , including his

16

exclusion from four West European countri es because of these

17

activities .

These activities have resulted

On one occasion his coauthor of a book in Kingston,

19

Jamaica, identified 15 reported CIA agents whose homes - - the

20

homes of two of which were violently attacked by armed men

21

subsequent to the disclosure .

22

QUESTION:

General Mccree, may I ask you this ques-

23

tion , which perhaps I ought to know the answer to but don ' t .

24

What is the purpose of a passport?

25

ience in the couple of times I've been abroad other than in
5

It's been my own exper-

the Army that you don't need a passport to get out of this
2

country .
MR. McCREE:

3

A passport is currently required both

4

to enter and to leave the United States under an Act of Con-

5

gress in 1978, unless the President provides otherwise by

6

rule .

7

to any country, I believe, in this hemisphere except Cuba ,

8

and certain Western European countries do not require it

9

either .

10

And he has provided otherwise by rule with reference

But there is such a statute -QUESTION:

And with reference , I think, to all

11

members of the Armed Services who leave the country under

12

orders , because they ' re ordered to.

13

MR . McCREE:

MR . McCREE:

MR . McCREE:

And that would of course -A soldier doesn't need a passport.
Of course he does not .
To be sent to West Germany.
And that's, of course , not inconsis-

18

tent, either, with the presidential rule which exempts non -

19

military personnel from leaving the country.

20

QUESTION:

Do you think that if the President

21

should appoint Mr. X as his ambassador plenipotentiary to the

22

Middle East and direct the Secretary of State who

23

employee to issue a passport to him, that Congress could pro-

24

hibit the issuance of that passport?

25

MR . McCREE:

is

his

I think not , and I'm confident he
6

could not, and it may be that there is a general rule which
2

would exclude a person .

3

in the President in the Travel Control Act of 1978 would more

4

than cover that, because the President can exempt from the

5

operation of this statute, which forbids departure and reen-

6

try without a passport, according to rules and regulations

7

that he might promulgate .
There are -- to reply to Mr . Justice Rehnquist's

9

Certainly, the authorization vested

first question , the passport as I understand it serves

two

10

purposes .

First, the purpose of identifying the bearer as a

11

cicizen or a national of the issuing nation; and second, to

12

request free passage for him from a foreign nation as well as

13

the efforts of the foreign nation to facilitate his travel .
QUESTION:

14

In its origins, Mr . Solicicor General,

15

was it not in effect a letter of introduction from the

16

President of the United states?

17

MR . McCREE:

18

It was essentially that, Mr . Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

19

And are there not extant passports given

20

190 and 180 years ago that were personally signed by the

21

President?
MR . McCREE:

There very well may have been because

23

before 1856

the Congress did not enter this area of passport

24

control at all.

25

President of the United States, the Secretary of State, and

Before 1856, che first passport act, the

7

indeed other persons , including governors, mayors, and in
2

some instances notaries public executed, issued passports ,

3

and the purpose of the Act of 1856, as we point out in our

4

brief, was to restrict the issuance just to the Secretary of

s

State, acting under the President of the United States, under

6

such rules and regulations as he might promulgate .
QUESTION :

7

But even after 1856, for many years,

8

almost a century or more, a passport was not a travel control

9

document as such, was it?
MR . McCREE :

10

That ' s exactly right, and exceot in

11

time qf war, there were few instances when

12

As we show historically in our brief, in the War of 1812, for

13

e xample, for the first time that we could trace, a passport

14

was required for travel control, and this applied to persons

IS

who had crossed the enemy lines.

it occurred.

I think this was in 1815.

16

The second time I believe it happened was at the

17

time of the Civil War, when again a travel control statute

18

was enacted .

19

World War, when again a travel control statute was issued.

The third time was 1918, just after the First

And part of our argument, of course, is that when

20
21

these travel control statutes -- and I could take the others

22

from 1918 .

23

each of these travel control statutes was passed, they assume

24

that the President would be issuing and refusing to issue

25

passports, because

There was 1941, and 1952, and then 1978 .

a

When

travel control act would not make
8

sense to require a passport if it didn ' t emanate from some2

place, nor would it make sense if there was not the power to

3

revoke or, indeed, to decline its issuance .
And we contend that this is evidence that the

4

5

Congress intended the Secretary of State to have the authorit

6

which we insist he possessed here to revoke res pondent ' s

7

passport .

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, on the other hand , you can k i nd of

turn that argument around and say that so long as a passport

10

was no more than a letter of introduction, so to speak,

11

that maybe it was in <:he discretion of the President not to

12

give such a letter to anybody whose morals he didn ' t like ,

13

but it wouldn't affect that person very much.

14

MR .· ?lcCREE:

That's correct, and there have been

15

instances when the President has endeavored to do that , just

16

because he didn't aoprove of someone's polii:ical beliefs,

17

for example .

18

QUESTION:

19

MR . McCREE:

Right.
And that's the Kent case , where this

20

Court without reaching the constitutional contention that

21

was made there, held that a passport could not be denied a

22

person because of his political affiliation.

23

the Congress attempted to do that, in Aptheker and Dayton

24

this Court determined that it was unconstitutional to do it.

25

And later when

We ' re not contending for thought control, or the
9

control of associations here .

We're contending that when

2

a citizen ' s activities, not his thoughts, abroad are causing

3

or are likely to cause serious damage to the national secu-

4

rity and the foreign policy of the United States, that the

s

President has the power not to issue the passport or, if

6

having issued it, to revoke it .
That ' s exactly what happened in this case when in

7

e

December, 1979, just a month after the seizure of the hostage

9

in Teheran, and after this extraordinary statement at a press

10

conference by the respondent, the Secretary of State notified

11

respondent that his passport had been revoked and told him

12

that he was entitled to a hearing under the appropriate regu-

13

lat ion, and offered to hold an expedited hearing in West

14

Germany where respondent lives .
QUESTION:

15

And in this case the effect of the

16

revocation of the passport was to bring the man home and

17

make him stay there?
MR. McCREE :

18
19

QUESTION:

And that wouldn't have been the effect

of the revocation of a passport in the 19th century?
MR. HcCREE:

22

23

This would be the purpose of it . Or

certainly to deprive him

20
21

To his home, back in our country?

Without a travel control; that's cor-

rect .

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. McCREE:

In the 19th century?
Without a travel control statute,
10

concomitant travel control statute, which we say must be con2

sidered in pari materia with this passport control .

3

QUESTION :

What, as a practical matter, happened

4

when it was revoked?

Did he turn it in and did he come back

5

to the United States?· ·Does the record tell?
MR . McCREE:

6

I'm advised that he went to the con-

7

sulate where he tendered it for validation, and it was taken

8

up by the employee at the consulate, and he was given instead

9

an identification card which would permit him to return home,

10

but he cannot use for extended travels , and so physically

11

his passport has been cancelled .
QUESTION;

12

But isn't the question whether he can

13

use that card for exte nded travel a question of whatever law

14

he , the country he seeks to travel to or from?
MR . McCREE :

It has been amended, I believe, insofar as it pertains

to area , to permissible areas , where the holder of a passport
can go .

MR. McCREE :

Oh , yes , it' s been c ha nge d several

t imes , and our point , and our argument

t hat with the

ch anges , as Mr . Justice White has pointed out , where the
delegated power to be issued from court s to passport offices
and so forth, the Congress being aware of this practice by
the Secretary of State has never seen fit to withdraw the
power to deny the issuance on the one hand, or to deny the
power to revoke a passport once issued on the other, for the
reason involved here, and that is the national security of
the country, which -QUESTION:

Do you think that the Congress would hav

t he authority to do that?

Take this

that the

Congress decides that there are just too many people leaving
14

the country and traveling around and as a result we ' re having
·2

to provide too much protection in the way

o= military

force

3

abroad, because they're getting into trouble.

4

want anybody leaving the country and therefore we forbid the

5

issuance of passports .

6

MR. McCREE:

So we don't

Do you think
That would raise a consti tutional

7

question, at a minimum, because this Court has h eld that the

8

right to international travel is a constitutionally protected

9

right, although entitled to lesser protection than intrastate

10

travel .

11

QUESTION :

It ' s also held in Curtiss- Wright that

12

the President is the sole organ of execution in the area of

13

foreign affa irs, is it not?
MR . McCREE :

14

Well, that , of course, is the separa-

15

tion of powers argument, which would also be involved

16

there to be such a situation as the Court has propounded .
QUEST I ON :

17

were

Well , I gather, Mr . Solicitor General ,

18

that as to the subject of revocation, insofar as there are

19

any constitutiona l implications, it ' s irrelevant that Congres

20

has ·n ot expressly given the Secretary of State power to

21

revoke?

22

MR . McCREE:

Well, I would contend that .

But we

23

are not claiming for the purposes of this litigation the

24

inherent power to revoke, because we

25

QUESTION :

Well, you ' re not suggesting either, are
15

you, that the power to revoke depends upon some statutory
2

authority?
MR . McCREE :

3

Not at all , but we're willing to

4

address this question as the Court of Appeals address ed it,

5

which was to see whether the Congress impliedly granted the

6

authority to revoke when it granted the authority t o grant.

that there was not because there was not what it regarded as

the District of Columbia set forth with great feeling in his
dissenting opinion .

They are political activities and

They are certainly activities creating serious danger

QUESTION:

Incidentally, in that connection,

Mr. Solicitor General , I notice in Footnote 7 of
the Court of Appeals' opinion, a footnote at 14a which
recites, based on statistics supplied by the Secretary,
that in 1955 21 passport applications were refused, and in
17

1956 ten such applications refused because the applicants

were "participants in political affairs ... "

QUESTION :

15

Well, does this case involve something

more, like Kent v . Dulles, or are the areas of restriction

17

similar?

18

MR . McCREE:

No , this case involves identifying

a covert employee , an undercover employee of our intelligence

service, and leaving ' him to the tender mercies of whatever

21

might happen to a person so identified i n a country where we

MR . WULF:

Because

This case does involve the con stitutional right to

4

S

travel .

According to doctrine by this Court in Kent and

6

Zemel , the power to issue passports is a power that ulti -

7

mately is within the authority of the Congress of the

8

Unite d ' States,

9

explicitly or implicitly any curtailment on the right to

and

Congress

mu st

authorize

either

10

travel .

The Government, of course, concedes that there's

11

no explicit authorization in this case, and the task of this

12

Court is to see whether it can divine from the history pre-

13

sented to it by the Government and by ourselves as well whe -

14

ther tnere is any implicit authorization which has to be based

15

as the Court held in Kent and Zemel on a substantial and

16

consistent administrative practice.
I would like to just summarize our argument in a

17

18

nutshell and then treat each of the separate arguments indi-

19

vidually .

20

of-this case, because Kent, taken together with its companion

21

case Dayton, in fact was a case which dealt with matters of

22

national security and foreign policy considerations .

23

not merely a case confined to speech and association, as the

24

Government would have the Court see it.

25

Our first argument is that Kent itself disposes

It was

Two, should the Court disagree with our analysis

24

about the extent of Kent, then we can show histori cally that
2

there is a total absence of any substantial and consistent

3

practice , which is required to find that Congress implicitly

4

authorized the regulation involved in this case .

5

Both of those arguments are supported by the fact

6

that after Kent was decided by this Court in 1958, the then

7

Administration tried very , very hard , and very , very unsuc-

8

cessfuly to secure legislation which would authorize the very

9

kind of authority which it has exercised in this case against

10

Mr . Agee .
And finally, looking around for what the intention

11
12

of Congress actually is, we come to the amendments in 1978 ,

13

substantial amendments in 1978, of Section 2ll(a) , which is

14

the fundamental passport authority, and Section 1185, which

15

is the lineal descendent of all of the wartime national

16

emergency provisions .
QUESTION :

17

Mr . Wulf, to what extent do you think

18

that Congress can limit the President's authority to revoke

19

or grant a passport to someone whom he has previously issued

20

it to?
MR. WULF :

21

According to the decision in Kent, he

22

has plenary -- Congress has plenary authority.

23

resides in Congress, it does not reside in the Executive

24

Branch .

25

QUESTION:

The authority

Do you think that if the President
25

ap points an ambassador to Italy and trouble comes up in
2

Italy and the President summons the ambassador home, that the

3

ambassador can simply stay in Italy and keep his passport,

4

saying I've got a right to travel and I ' m not going to come

5

home?

MR . WULF:

Well , he can certainly be deposed and --

12

13

no longer ambassador .

14

In that case he would presumably have a

explicitly,

Congress

He ' d

expressed what its

15

intentions were, and its intenti ons there were to withdraw

16

whatever authority the Court had allowed it to exercise in

17

the area of geographical restrictions, in the Zemel case; and

18

secondly, it revoked Section 1185 of the Title VIII, which

19

was the travel control statute, and reversed the purpose of

20

that statute 180 degrees and required , although it still re-

21

quires that passports be used for entry and exit by citizens

22

of the United States , the purpose is not to allow the

23

Executive Branch to exercise travel control over citizens who

24

hold passports , but to facilitate -- and that is e xplicitly

25

what is in all of the congressional his t ory relating to 1185
26

-- to facilitate travel of American citizens because of the
2

now general requirement abroad that travelers present pass-

3

ports upon entry to foreign countries .
QUESTION:

MR . WULF :

13

of that period when travel by American communists and commun-

14

ist sympathizers was prohibited, during the ' 50s.

15

the expressions, all of the explanations about why that was

16

being done had to do with considerations which were identical

17

to the kind of national security and foreign policy concerns

18

expressed by the Government in this case .

that litigation get themselves involved in releasing classi-

The party in Dayton v . United States,

which was a companion case to Kent, the basis on which his

here, was that it was thought that he had something to do -27

Our brief essentially here today is that given the

Government's best case, in its brief , in terms of the histori

20

cal information which it has provided the Court, that this

21

Court cannot confidently conclude that the Congress has im-

22

plicitly authorized the power which the Government seeks to

23

exercise here , that the Government's best case leaves it very

24

doubtful, leaves it very ambiguous , leaves it very uncertain,

25

about whether the kind of implicit authorization which is

MR . WULF:

I think they are insignificant, Your

Honor, because there's no explanation about what they mean .

21

And they're as insignificant as are the other statistics

QUESTION:

You won't?

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Wulf, can I ask what your position

a

11

is with respect to the authority of the Secretary of State

12

to revoke a passport for matters such as writing bad checks,

13

being convicted of crimes, or something of that kind, non-

14

political in context, but is there authority for the Secretar

15

to do it?

16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23

24

25

MR. WULF:

I think he doesn 't have authority.

QUESTION :

He does not have?

MR. WULF:

That's right .

If that was done abroad,

if it's not a crime within the United States -- it might be,
under some statute; I wouldn ' t want to say conclusively -but if it ' s according to Kent, there are only two grounds
upon which the Executive Branch can refuse to issue passports
One , whether or not the applicant is a citizen; and two, whether the applicant is trying

to

escape the foils of the law, as th

It's pretty clear that what they mean is
31

whether the applicant has committed a crime within the United

States .
QUESTION:

Well, do you agree that that's a proper

basis for revocation of a passport, and if so, what's the

5

authority for that?

MR. WUL F:

QUESTION:

The authority for that is that Kent

MR. WULF:

Kent found the authority when it hadn't

Where did it find it?

MR . WULF:

In history.

14

QUESTION:

In history, rather than in any written

Absolutely; absolutely.

7

the Secretary at least for some reason may revoke a passport?

10

MR . WULF:

haven ' t argued

that there ' s -- we haven't argued a distinction between a
refusal to issue and a revocation .

11

I wouldn ' t deny that .

And if he can refuse for a reason he can

revoke for the same reason?

13

MR . WULF :

Well, are you suggest i ng now , Mr . vlulf,

as in Kent, that Mr . Agee ' s activit i es have First Amendment

17

MR . WULF:

Yes .

18

QUESTION:

Well, then you reject

19

MR . WULF:

But I go beyond that, of course, because

have stated in his press release in Londo n i n 1974 , including

11

the e xposing of CIA agents abroad?

12

MR . WULF :

MR . WULF:

Yes .

QUESTION:

But even if exposing the agents, as the

20

22

a proper exercise of the First Amendment?

23

MR . WULF:

There is no claim at all here that his

revelations have resulted in anybody's death .

25

there has been attempts continually being made for the last

it a crime to identify CIA and otl'ier covert action --

QUESTION:

It ' s very difficult to draw that sort of

legislation.
MR. WULF:

in doing it, and no bill has been acted on, no statute has

been adopted.

But if it adopted --

Until then, if such a statute should be

In the meantime, I believe that that

Not void for vagueness?

The First Amendment protects a right

to disclose publicly secret agents of the United States wher2

ever they may be?
MR. WULF :

That ' s your position?
In general that is my position .

In particular, I would say that Mr. Agee, like Mr . Snepp,

would be subject to the same terms of the secrecy agreement,

to the same terms of the secrecy agreement that he executed.

7

And in fact, he is now subject to that agreement.

8

an injunction outstanding against him, which he is complying

9

with.

So whatever -- as of the past few months .

There is

So what-

10

ever may have been the case before then, he is now bound by

11

that injunction.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Wulf , suppose then that Mr. Agee or

13

somebody else applies for a passport and he says , I know I 'm

14

subject to a secrecy agreement but I want to go to England

15

and reveal the names of people that I am forbidden to reveal

16

here, and if I go to England I can do it and probably get

17

away with it.

But I fully intend to breach my contract by

18

going abroad .

And the Secretary says, well, awfully sorry,

19

you're subject to the agreement and you're not going to get a

20

passport.

21

22

MR . WULF:

I would think that that's not the remedy

The remedy is not to deprive him of a passport.

The remedy

23

is to proceed on a contempt citation against him under the

24

injunction.

25

QUESTION:

Once he's in England.
36

Once he 's in

England.
2

MR . WULF:

When he comes back , if he comes back .

3

QUESTION:

Well, how can actions taken in England

4

violate the law of the United States?

5
6

QUESTION:

Suppose he killed somebody at the press

conference, could he be prosecuted over here?

7

MR . WULF:

No .

8

QUESTION:

That's a violation of the law of Great

10

MR . WULF:

Yes .

11

QUESTION:

Mr . Wulf , I don't th i nk you ' ve answered

12

Britain .

Mr . Justice Stewart or Justice White .
MR . WULF:

13

Well, the answer is that if he has so

l4

conducted himself that he is not

15

which is only a crime by the law of a foreign state, he

16

can't be, he cannot be prosecuted here .
QUESTION :

17

Well, suppose it's not a crime by the

18

law of the foreign state?

question.

MR . WULF:

I think that ' s Justice Stewart's

If it's a crime by the law of the United

States, he can be prosecuted here, of course .
QUESTION:

Even though the conduct's committed

abroad, where it ' s not a crime?
MR . WULF:

It might in some circumstances .

there are some extraterritorial probl ems

I think

QUESTION :

Well , if it were , if Congress did pass

2

the law you referred to and made it a cri me to do that, and

3

a person applied for a passport and the Secretary says,

4

what are you -- somehow the Secretary knew and he freely

s

conceded that he was going to go abroad and break t hat law,

6

could he refuse a passport?
MR . WULF :

7

I said I do not believe so, and I believ

8

his remedy is in the criminal law, or if there ' s an injunc -

9

tion , for contempt .

10

QUESTION :

Get an injunction before he gets on the

MR . WULF:

Perhaps they can get an i njunction to en

11
12

p l ane .

13

force the injunction

against him prohi bi t i ng him from re-

14

vealing information .

But apart from that, I believe that

15

there is no authority to withhold his passport .

16

QUESTION:

And you think that the in personam

17

restraint of an American court injunction would follow hi m in

18

London or Beirut or wherever?

19

MR . WULF:

An

in personam --

It might well, it might well.

I c ould

20

see that kind of an injunction which is breached abroad

21

being basis for a contempt citation here.

22

QUESTION:

Mr . Wulf, putting to one side --

23

MR . WULF:

That wouldn't shock me very much .

I mus

24

say, though, that this concentration on the facts of this

25

particular case, I beg your leave , doesn't have anything to
38

do really with the i ssue which is before the Court .

I mean,

2

I can understand why the Government has concentrated on the

3

facts in this case in trying to make

4

QUESTION :

Mr . Wulf , let 's put these facts to one

s

side for a moment and put to one side cases in which there ar

6

preexisting contracts restraints or violations of law ; just

7

the conduct of an American citizen while abroad .

8

United States have any control over what a citizen may do

9

other than by trying to restrict his right to travel by re-

10

voking his passport?

11

which is essentiaily your position --

12
13

14

MR. WULF:

If it has any .

Does the

Maybe it has none,

I think it has none unless there is an

extraterritorial crime has been committed.
QUESTION:

But if it has, other than extraterri-

15

torial crime , which is a rather

16

course, but other than that, if it is to impose any meaning-

17

ful control over what our citizens abroad may do that may

18

impact on national security or anything else, it must be

19

through this device, must it not?

20

MR . WULF :

there are instances, of

Yes , it must be .

But the issue today is

21

whether Congress declares that it will be .

22

issue today .

23

QUESTION:

I mean, that's th

Well , I know , but precisely, the issue

24

is whether the regulation issued pursuant to the statute that

25

Congress did enact was within the power of the President as
39

delegated to the Secretary of State under that statute .
2
3

MR · WULF·:

No, I disagree .

The issue is, whether

there was any authority for the regulation at all .
QUESTION:

4

The regulation purports to have been

s

issued pursuant to the statute which says, it gives the power

b

initially to the President , and he 's redelegated it to the

7

Secretary of State .

8

QUESTION:

9

'. /ell , Mr . Wulf, you would like to put

Mr . Agee in the same category as any other citizen, and treat

10

him like any other citizen .

11

any other citizen and still lose about Mr . Agee .

12

would be because he is subject to an agreement which you agre

13

binds him .

Well, I don't think that that has any

bearing at all , Your Honor .

I know you don't but he isn't, in that

regard he's not like just any other citizen .

For purposes of travel I believe he is

like any other citizen, and I don ' t see how
QUESTION :

Well , o ther c itizens aren't subject to

the agreement , though .
MR . WULF :

At least you have to concede that .

I concede that, but I also would argue

23

that that agreement is subject to independent enforcement,

24

which has no bearing on the question, the basic question here

25

about congressional authorization .
40

I mean , obviously,

I would like you all to forget about the facts of the Agee
2

case, and I think that you have to . and

QUESTION:

I suppose you'd take the same position

i f the secrecy agreement said , nor will I travel abroad to

do so?
MR . WULF:

9

I might take a different position, but

10

it doesn ' t say that, of course , so I don't have to take any

11

position .
QUESTION :

12

13

I take it all of your answers exclude

" in time of declared war" ?
MR . WULF :

14

We don ' t deny that in times of declared

15

war there can be restrictions, limitations imposed on travel

16

which would not be unconstitutional, and of course

17

has adopted such legislation in 1918, 1941, and related

legislation in 1952 .

22

Our second argument, of course, goes to the ques-

23

tion whether there is any proof presented, historical proof

24

presented to you by the Government which would persuade you

25

that there is the necessary consistent history of
41

adminis trative p r actice which is necessary to find authori2

zation .

You were talking about a history ,

it also lumps together those other

MR . WULF :

Well, there were 62 in their opening

as the basis for their support of an administrative practice .

They ' re in the brief and it was only one of them, in 1970,

18

which was in fact under the same regulation . The others

19

weren' t under a ny regulation at all , as a matter of fact .

was -- t hey were just under the claimed discretion of the

21

Secretary of State .

22

It turns out to be 100 in their reply
Specifically they

As I said in opening, I think that these examples

23

of administrative practice presented to the Court by the

24

Government are far too ambiguous, far too uncertain a basis

25

upon which this Court ought to rest its judgment
42

that they

It

will find implicit authorization.

I think that that --

2

QUESTION:

Implicit authorization to do what?

3

MR . WULF:

Implicit authorization for the regula-

tion applied here against Mr . Agee .

s

QUESTION:

You mean, to revoke for these reasons?

6

MR. WULF:

To refuse passports

7

QUESTION:

Because you agree that there is a power

9

MR. WULF:

Yes .

For the right reasons?

MR. WULF:

Quite; quite right.

And there's a historical practice of

Yes .

Precisely;

and the Court ought not make that decision on the basis of

19

ought to require, in light of the fact that this is a consti-

20

tutional right, that Congress exclusively say what

21

tentions are with respect to this kind of power which is

22

asserted in the regulation before the Court.

QUESTION:

That decision ought to be, the Court

in-

Well, anyway, Mr. Wulf, you would argue

24

that if there were explicit statutory authorization to re-

25

voke for this kind of conduct, the statute to that extent
43

was unconstitutional because this kind of conduct has First
2

Amendment protection?
MR . WULF:

3

I would make that argument, but then we

would deal squarely with the constitutionality in First

Amendment terms of the authority which was concededly granted

to the Executi ve Branch .

had given to the Government in the Zemel case regarding

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr . Solicitor General,

do you have any -- ?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. McCREE, JR . , ESQ.,

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

19

MR . McCREE:

20
21

Mr . Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court :
If I have 60 seconds left I'd like to call the

22

Court's attention to two matters.

23

counsel's claim about the effect and the intent of the 1978

24

amendments, I would refer you to page 47 of our brief, where

25

we set forth the Senate report which makes it clear, and
44

First, in response to

I read:
2

"The Committee recognizes clearly that the

3

passport authority should not be restricted in any

4

way which would limit the President's ability to

5

control the departure of United States citizens

6

to fore i gn countries when such travel is inconsis-

7

tent with a greater Government interest . "

8
9

The other matter to which I would like to direct
the Court's attention, if I may, is on this seven-page

10

reply memorandum that we filed to the Petition for

11

Certiorari, where we set forth the colloquy conducted by

12

the court and counsel in the district court, where counsel

13

under very careful questioning concedes that for the purpose

14

of the determination of the validity of this regulation, he

15

concedes that his client was causing or likely to cause

16

serious damage to the national security .

17

therefore, that he admits that he is fully within the ambit

18

of this regulation which means that this Court needn't decide

19

the question whether his conduct was within the regulation.

20

Of course, it leaves the constitutional question as well as

21

the statutory authorization question to be determined.
And with that, we would submit our case on the

22

And I suggest,
