ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE R. DERR, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DERR:

7

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question of whether sex-based

10

wage discrimination claims are subject to a different stan­

1 1

dard of proof when such claims are asserted under Title VII

12

of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than the equal pay for equal

13

work standard of the Equal Pay Act of 1963.

14

The respondents are former employees of the

15

petitioner, Washington County.

The respondents were jail

16

matrons who guarded female prisoners in the county jail and

17

had other clerical duties.

18

by deputy sheriffs and later by corrections officers.

19

The respondents filed this case in the federal district

20

court alleging that they had received compensation lower

21

than that received by their male counterparts doing substan­

22

tially the same work.

23

jobs had been terminated in retaliation for making that equal

24

pay claim and that they had been refused the right to be

25

rehired, also in retaliation.

The male prisoners were guarded

They also raised a claim that their

3

The trial court found that the jobs were substan­

1

2

tially dissimilar on the facts, and therefore denied the equal

3

pay claim.

4

tion, that there were good business reasons for the fact that

5

the jobs were terminated.

6

additional space in the jail to respond to an overcrowding

7

problem, an ACLU suit.

It also found that there was no retaliatory reac­

And those had to do with providing

8

In a post-trial brief after the facts were in, the

9

respondents raised for the first time the claim that even if

10

the jobs were not equal, that the great differential in pay

11

between the comparison jobs could only be at least partially

12

explained by sex discrimination.

13

to were the very pay scales which caused the source of the

14

comparison.

15

The only evidence pointed

The trial court held on the basis of the laws that

16

existed prior to this case that since the Equal Pay Act stan­

17

dards applied and since the jobs were substantially dissimi­

18

lar, that is, not substantially equal, that the judge had no

19

authority to override the wage rates set by the employer and

20

the union in this case.

21

The respondents appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of

22

Appeals and raised one other point of fact found in the

23

record, and that was a statement by the sheriff of the county

24

that at one point in time he felt that the matrons, the

25

respondents here, should have been paid more than they were
4

1

being paid.

No other evidence was asserted as supporting

2

this comparison of jobs as opposed -- unequal jobs as opposed

3

to equal jobs.
One other assertion was made for the first time on

4

5

appeal to the 9th Circuit by the respondents, and that is

6

that they were prevented during the trial from introducing

7

additional information to support their comparable job claim.

8

However, they have never pointed to what that evidence was

9

nor anyplace in the record where they were denied that right.

10

And, in fact, it's hard to understand how that could be the

1 1

case since the claim was first raised in post-trial briefing,

12

not in the complaint or the pre-trial order.
QUESTION:

13

Hr. Derr,

one thing that bothers me

14

about this case is the extent to which we are talking about

15

kind of an abstract distinction which may not boil down to

16

too much when it comes to actual application.

17

view is the difference between equal work and comparable

18

work?

19

MR. DERR:

What in your

Comparable work is simply the tip of the

20

iceberg of an open-ended interpretation of Title VII in the

21

area of sex discrimination.

22

one that is defined by the statute and through case refine­

23

ments, that’s a concept that's understood.

24

tation that started in the Equal Pay Act is not applied as

25

well to Title VII, then any theory is available to a plaintiff

The concept of equal work is

5

But if that limi­

1

or a claimant to attempt to show that there was discrimina­

2

tion based on sex.

3

and there are many versions and explanations of it.

4

sence, it amounts to comparing the value of different jobs to

5

the employer, then comparing the wages, and drawing a deduc­

6

tion from a difference between value and wages that sex dis­

7

crimination is the motivation, and I think by the explana­

8

tion -QUESTION:

9

Comparable work is one of those theories
In es­

In that area you could -- I'm sure your

10

sister will disagree with this, or the extent of this, but

11

in the extreme logic of it you could compare the wage rights

12

of truck drivers with that of secretaries, for example.
MR. DERR:

13

Very definitely.

There's absolutely no

14

limitation upon the comparisons that can be drawn, only in

15

the ability of the analysis to make any rational connection.

16

And of course,

17

proof that it has outlined and recently described in the

18

Texas v. Burdine case.

19

volves intent, is initially on the plaintiff only to show

20

a prima facie case, to show a set of circumstances that

21

create an inference that there may have been discriminatory

22

motive.

23

Into the type of a situation which Congress did not intend

24

them to get into, and that's attempting to evaluate different

25

jobs and the relative value of those jobs.

this

Court is well aware of the method of

The burden of proof, although it in­

At that threshold level the courts will already be

6

1

In other words, at the very threshold level of

2

determining whether there is a prima facie case in these

3

comparison-of-unequal-job sort of cases, the courts will have

4

to make an analysis, a subjective analysis that Congress did

5

not intend.

But you --

QUESTION:

6

I was just going to ask Mr. Derr, I ga­

7

ther on the Equal Pay Act where we deal,

T suppose, with sometl ing

8

like identical jobs In the sense, for example, of an airline

9

steward, it doesn't matter whether they are male or female,

10

they do exactly the same thing.

Here, I gather, there are

1 1

differences in the job duties of the female guards and the

12

male guards, are there?

13

MR. DERR:

That's correct.

14

QUESTION:

To that extent there's no identity of

That issue was --

15

duty between the male and female jobs here, as there would

16

be in my hypothetical of the airline steward?

17
18

MR. DERR:

presents the issue squarely,

19

20

QUESTION:

MR. DERR:

25

because --

That was a finding of the district court,

And that was upheld by the 9th Circuit

Court of Appeals.

24

This case

was it not?

21

22

That's correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals did not change

MR. DERR:

And that's not contested by respondents.

it.

7

QUESTION:

1

And the claim isn't that women are put

2

in these jobs, and men put in these, discriminatorilv?

3

The claim is just on the pay?

4

MR. DERR:

That's correct.

There is no claim of

5

denial of access, and in fact there is a finding in the

6

record by the trial courts and I believe noted by the 9th

7

Circuit that there was access to the higher paid jobs.

8

respondents are claiming larger pay for the jobs that they

9

were in and not disputing the fact that they had access to

10

These

the higher paying jobs.
QUESTION:

1 1

And your position would be that even

12

if you didn't have to rely on inference to prove intention,

13

even if they had the employer cold, so to speak, that there

14

would be no Title VII liability?
MR. DERR:

15

No, that hypothetical was raised by the

16

9th Circuit.

more.

22

They stated it as though the employer would

The 9th Circuit felt that that would not be covered

QUESTION:

Judge Van Dusen

Well, isn't it your position now,

23

Mr. Derr, that unless the guards have a case under the Equal

24

Pay Act, they have none under Title VII?

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

1

MR. DERR:

For wage-based sex discrimination.

2

QUESTION:

For anything, whether intentional or not.

3

MR. DERR:

The Equal Pay Act is an intentional

4

act.

It does require an attempt to discriminate on the basis

5

of sex, and that's true because one of the defenses is that ii'

6

the discrimination is based on -QUESTION:

7

8

I know, but the case doesn't get off the

ground unless the jobs are identical?

9

MR. DERR:

That's correct.

10

QUESTION:

Unless they're like my hypothetical of

1 1

the airline steward's job?

12

MR. DERR:

That's correct.

13

QUESTION:

Unless it's like that -- and since the

14

finding here by two courts is, it's not, you say there's no

15

Title VII claim?
MR. DERR:

16

That's correct, Your Honor, but if I may

17

respond to the hypothetical, there are remedies and one of th^m

18

is

9th Circuit, I believe, felt that uftless there was an

23

QUESTION:

1

2

Even though your current force is 100

percent female?
MR. DERR:

3

That's right.

The best example is a

4

situation where there was just one person holding the job.

5

If the person is a female and is terminated or leaves and a

6

male comes into that particular job, it's possible to make

7

that comparison.

8

of the Department of Labor and there are cases that have held.

9

The thing that takes the next step and makes the Equal Pay

That's consistent with the interpretation

10

Act the sort of remedy that it should be is to recognize that

11

if the employer hypothesizes a male employee as perhaps the

12

next incumbent, that should be no different than having to

13

wait until the time that that next incumbent comes along.
And so that the employer who makes the statement

14
15

that I would pay a man more, or, I will pay you less than I

16

would a man, has made a comparison of necessity and by defini­

17

tion to equal work and has shown a violation of the Equal Pay

18

Apt.

19

QUESTION: Is it true, then, Mr. Derr, that the

20

problem presented by this case only affects those job cate­

21

gories that are bona fide gender-based classifications?

22

Because if you have a history of passed male or female in

23

the opposite sex category, you can always find your remedy

24

under the Equal Pay Act, if I understand you?

25

MR. DERR:

So that --

I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I understand
10

1

2

the relationship of bona fide qualification, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, the problem that you're addressing

3

in this case is one in which there's a separate female cate­

4

gory of jobs and a separate male category of jobs, entirely

5

separate, and then -- you assume it won't be changed in the

6

future, and it's always been that way, in both categories?

7

QUESTION:

8

to the higher jobs?

9

MR. DERR:

Yes, definitely.

10

QUESTION:

Well, at least the category that we're

1 1

Oh, I thought you said there was access

talking about here is an exclusively female category?

12

QUESTION:

No.

13

MR. DERR:

The matron's job was an exclusively

14

female category of job.

15

to the females.

16
17

QUESTION:

But the higher-paying jobs were open

You mean the matrons might have had

access to the males' j obs ?

18

MR. DERR:

That's correct.

19

QUESTION:

Of superintending male prisoners?

20

MR. DERR:

Yes .

21

QUESTION:

Are there any?

22

MR. DERR:

The jobs do not exist -- well, the

23

matrons' jobs do not exist.

24

female incumbents in those jobs.

25

there are any female corrections officers at the moment.

The deputy sheriffs, there are

11

I'm not certain whether

1

There were notduring this period of time.

2

QUESTION

But they are open?

3

MR. DERR:

But they are definitely open; that was a

4

finding of the case -QUESTION:

5

6

Has there ever been one?

A female cor-

rections officer?

7

MR. DERR:

A corrections officer?

8

QUESTION

That's really the comparison here, isn't

MR. DERR:

And

9
10

it?
the

deputy sheriffs, because this

1 1

covers a period of time when the deputies in a rotation were

12

doing the jail guarding and later when the corrections offi-

13

cers were doing it exclusively.

14

QUESTION:

Then there have been -- ?

15

MR. DERR:

There are deputy sheriffs who are female.

16

I do not know whether there are any corrections officers.

17

There were not in the period of less than a year that that

18

was pertinent in this case.

19

20
21

22

QUESTION:

The reason that --

But this would be a perfectly straight­

forward Title VII case if there were no access.
MR. DERR

That's true, but under another provision

of Title VII which is unaffected by the Equal Pay Act.

23

QUESTION

Yes .

24

QUESTION

Let me just ask one here.

25

Assume that,

instead of this being a pay case, that they were complaining
12

1

they had to work Saturdays instead of -- and the corrections

2

officers did not, or they had to work till 6 o'clock and

3

they only had to work till five, omsething like that.

4

would clearly violate Title VII, wouldn't it?

5

anything but pay?

6
7

MR. DERR:

brought under Title VII.
QUESTION: "Whiteapple."

9

MR. DERR:

1 1

it's

It would present a case that could be

8

10

If

That

Yes; if it had to deal with conditions

of employment.
QUESTION:

Well, supposing they said they get paid

12

for overtime if they're male but they don't if they're female,

13

in the two categories?

14

MR. DERR:

That appears to me to be a compensation

15

case and most likely would be a case that could be brought

16

under the Equal Pay Act standard and therefore must be.

17

QUESTION:

Only under Equal Pay, if they said the

18

men get overtime and the females do not?

19

violate Title VII, in your judgment?

20

MR. DERR:

That would not

Well, that would present a question whe­

21

ther it involved some other factor other than wages and com­

22

pensation, and I would prefer not to venture a guess as to

23

how that might be interpreted by a court, but to the extent

24

that it was interpreted to be a legal question, it would not.

25

QUESTION:

Well, what would your position be?
13

1

MR. DERR:

On an overtime pay?

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

3

MR. DERR:

It appears to me that that would be

4

directly related to wages, and if they were denied the oppor­

5

tunity to work the overtime it would affect wages.
QUESTION:

6

Denied payment for the overtime?

7

males are paid time and a half and the females are paid

8

straight time for overtime?

If the

That's the only difference.

So you have no right under the Wage Act, under my

in that hypothetical case?
MR. DERR:

15
16

And they're in different categories, as they are

I don't believe so, Your Honor, any more

than the truck driver and the secretary situation.
QUESTION: Of course, the truck driver-secretary

17
18

wouldn't qualify under the 9th Circuit opinion either, because

19

those jobs are not substantially equal.

20

MR. DERR:

Well --

21

QUESTION:

They don't have to be; that's the point.

QUESTION:

The. 9th Circuit says they do.

MR. DERR:

The 9th Circuit is reading the substan­

tially equal limitation out of Title VII, which Congress in­

25

tended to be there as carrying into it from the Equal Pay Act.

MR. DERR:

Your Honor, they attempt to.

jobs, as they understand it, without other evidence.

13

other evidence would be evidence of intent and we submit that

comparisons that we draw, and they'd certainly be entitled to

or not it's sufficient to present a prima facie case.

23

ability to rewrite the statute and there's nothing to be

24

found in the statute that would say that.

25

QUESTION:

The 9th Circuit certainly has no

One of the problems, of

I presume the court would have to

20

take testimony, and make its own decision as a question of

fact.

22

MR. DERR:

That's correct.

The important point to

23

remember in understanding why Congress chose this to be the

24

state of affairs, that is, that sex-based wage discriminations

25

would be limited to the standards of the Equal Pay Act, is
16

1

that it considered these questions in 1962 and 1963.

The evi­

were allegations of dual standards of pay between males and

females,

original proposal before Congress, be adopted.

QUESTION:

What was that standard?

MR. DERR:

The standard was first worded as requir­

That was

13

the bare bones initial statement

14

modifiers as to skill.

15

and moved to the equal pay for equal work standard and in so

16

doing also added definitions and eliminated the per se or the

17

strict liability character of the Act by adding, as a defense,

18

that if the pay, even though for equal jobs, was disequal,

Mr. Derr?
MR. DERR:

Your Honor, if I may respond to that by

one word of introduction?

21

QUESTION:

Take your time.

22

MR. DERR:

When Title VII, of course, was before

23

Congress there was concern expressed, initially by others

24

and finally by Senator Bennett, that the decision reached in

25

the Equal Pay Act of 1963 might be abrogated or nullified in
19

1

some way by the broad sweep of Title VII, at the time that

2

sex was introduced as a protected classification.
QUESTION:

3
4

That was almost a happenstance, as I

recall, wasn't It?
HR. DERR:

5

It came after committee hearings had

6

ended in the House, while there was debate on the House floor.

7

It appeared in a proposed amendment by Representative Smith

8

and in the same afternoon was adopted with limited debate.

9

When the bill went to the Senate it never went through

10

committee hearing, it went straight to the Senate for debate,

1 1

and so there was very little really substantive discussion

12

of the sex amendment.
Senator Clark expressed the concern of others that

13
14

by so doing -- and since the coverage of Title VII is of

15

course, as we have mentioned, broader than the Equal Pay Act.

16

It covers such things as conditions of employment and access

17

to jobs -- that it would have the effect of

18

Equal Pay Act and of reading out of it the equal pay for

19

equal work limitation.

20

that concern by his understanding of the doctrine of in pari

21

materia construction which was simply to say that the subse­

22

quent enactment would not have that effect.

23

in Title VII as it was then before Congress that expressly

24

said that.

25

necessarily have been relying on in pari materia construction.

overreaching the

And so Senator Clark responded to

There was nothing

And that's why I say that Senator Clark must

20

1

However, Senator Bennett apparently was not comfortable with

2

leaving it at that, and so introduced an amendment.

3

tunately for the benefit of legislative history, that amend­

4

ment came after cloture had been invoked on the Senate floor

5

so that, for one thing, the date was extremely limited, and

6

for another, it was styled as a technical amendment.

Unfor­

That of course was consistent with what Senator

7

8

Bennett was doing, which was clarifying, not, as has been sug­

9

gested by other parties, narrowing the scope of Title VII, but

10

clarifying what Congress expected to be the narrow scope.
The Bennett Amendment refers to

11

Section 6(d) which

12

was the Equal Pay Act Amendment* to the Pair Labor Standards

13

Act.

14

Title VII to differentiate and pay on the basis of sex if

15

it's authorized by the Equal Pay Act.

16

interpretations put forth for what the Bennett Amendment

17

means.

18

by any party as this time is that all it did was incorporate

19

four defenses that are found as a part of the Equal Pay Act.

20

The reason that that can be discounted fairly simply is that

21

those four defenses already existed in Title VII as it was

22

proposed.

23

preceding the insertion of the Bennett Amendment in Section

24

703(h).

25

implicit in Title VII itself, which only creates a violation

And it states in essence that it is not a violation of

There have been three

The most narrow and I think one not strongly urged

The first three existed in a sentence immediately

The other one, any other factor other than sex, is

21

1

for discrimination based upon sex.
The second interpretation, and the one that's being

2
3

urged by the EEOC, is that they recognized that certainly

4

Senator Bennett and Congress intended more than the four de­

5

fenses.

6

defenses. And so they say that what he meant to do was simply

7

adopting the Equal Pay Act.

QUESTION:

Where he said specifically that it was

for the purpose of taking care of the exceptions? Didn't he?
MR. DERR:

He uses the word "exception" and in the

18

context in which he uses it, Your Honor, it's not clear what

19

he referred to.

20

any sense is that he intended to incorporate the equal pay

21

for equal work standard, all of Section 6(d), and used the

22

term "exception."

include the narrow employee and employer exemptions.

MR. DERR:

Yes, I do.

QUESTION:

What do you think Senator Bennett meant

4

when he referred to a "proper technical correction" of the

5

bill?
MR. DERR:

6

I believe that it's appropriate to view

7

the Bennett Amendment as a technical correction because it was

8

a clarifying amendment.

9

Title VII in the area of sex-based wage discrimination, it was

It was not a narrowing of the scope of

10

an explanation of Congress' intent and expectation that

1 1

Title VII would be that narrow.

12

QUESTION:

It's true, isn't it, that the '65 commenl

13

by Senator Bennett was never heard by the 97 other Senators,

14

or 99 other Senators, who had already enacted the bill into

15

law?

16

MR. DERR:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The reason

17

that it has relevance and weight is that there is nothing in

18

the legislative history to indicate to the contrary that that

19

was not the sense and intent of Congress when it was adopted.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but Mr. Derr --

21

MR. DERR:

Everything in the record is consistent.

22

QUESTION:

But haven't we quite frequently suggestec

23

that you have to proceed very cautiously in giving any weight

24

to post-enactment statements of what he meant by even spon­

25

sors of legislation?
24

MR. DERR:

1

Your Honor, that's very true, and it

2

certainly goes to an evaluation of the weight of the comments,

3

and we are not relying solely on that comment, although all

of the evaluative criteria that the Court has mentioned would

require that weight be given to it in this case.

that the defendants had

14

less.

appropriate way to pay the jail matrons was to pay them five

percent less than corrections officers.

time, were the persons performing services in the male section

of the jail.

He had previously

At trial we sought to pursue this matter further.

differential with the comment that, if the jobs are not

equal, the degree of pay differential or the reason therefor
25

has no relevance.

That is at pages 69 and 70 of the record.

The court also terminated testimony of two other
witnesses because he preferred to focus on other issues.

On the appeal, the 9th Circuit --

Did

No, I did not, Your Honor.

The judge -

That's usually the best way to preserve

a point like that, isn't it?
MS. HEWITT:

That is certainly true.

This was a

1 1

calculated risk in this case.

12

we felt confident we were going to win on other grounds.

13

I did not do it.

14

The judge was impatient, and

It was obviously an error, in hindsight.

The Court of Appeals remanded the case after re­

15

versing, stating that there should be further proceedings on

16

the question of what kind of proof there was of this claim.

17

Therefore, the question that is being reviewed is whether

18

Title VII prohibits wage discrimination for women by an

19

employer paying less than the rate that he has determined to

20

be appropriate for a job.

21

I think it's important in this case that the only

22

Issue of comparability comes because the employer sought to

23

determine the appropriateness of wages within the jail setting

24

by comparing one job to another and also by looking to

25

outside sources.

So it's the employer's system that we are
26

1

looking to, and we are saying, if the employer follows this

2

system and determines an appropriate rate of pay, then he

3

cannot lower that rate of pay because the incumbents are

4

women.

5

QUESTION:

Mrs. Hewitt, in a case where the employer1

6

has established a system of pay and set a certain rate for

7

secretaries and a certain rate for outside salesmen and the

8

outside salesmen's rate is higher or at any rate their gross

9

income is higher, do you think that could be attacked under

10
11

Title VII?
MS. HEWITT:

It could be attacked if there were some

12

reason to indicate that there were

13

into account in setting the wage rate, not --

And a classic example is

And

MS. HEWITT:

Do you think that a court can

My view of that is that that fact along:

21

would not state a prima facie case, because what Title VII

22

prohibits is discrimination because of sex, and the mere fact

23

that the plaintiff is a woman and she's comparing herself to

24

a man doesn't create any inference that there's discrimination

25

on the basis of sex.

The most obvious reason is discrimination
29

1

because the jobs are different.
QUESTION:

2

But your argument says, tells us, that

there could be a case of a discrimination even though the

jobs are quite different.
MS. HEWITT:

There certainly could be.

evaluation of what one person did versus another.

22

that they determined that the appropriate rate of pay for

23

corrections officers was one rate and for matrons was one

24

class below that, which was a five percent differential.

25

They then paid the women 35 percent less than they paid the

That system in this particular case consisted

30

Based on

1

corrections officers.

Now, I think it's quite possible in

2

this case that that raises an inference that there might have

3

been discrimination involved, given the fact that all the

4

matrons are women and all the corrections officers are men,

5

and it’s somewhat unusual for an employer to go to the prob­

6

lem of, go to the trouble of evaluating a job, determining

7

the appropriate rate of pay, and then pay one group who are

8

all women less and not men.

9

That -- it's possible that you have to come in and say --

But that may not be enough.

10

and I've got the sworn testimony of the employer that says,

11

yes, I did it, just because that person is a woman.
Now, there's a great variance in what might might

12
13

be sufficient to raise an inference of discrimination but

14

comparing it to the standards for discrimination in hiring

15

or promotion, the McDonnell-Douglas type of standards, the

16

threshold is relatively low, and the Court has found that

17

an inference of discrimination -QUESTION:

18

Are you saying that here, for example,

19

they priced the corrections officer, a male job, at $500 a

month; they priced the women's, matron's job at $400 a month,

21

but then they paid the corrections officers five but the

22

women 350?

MS. HEWITT:

Exactly.
That's what you say this case is?
That's exactly correct.
31

Yes, sir.

Now, the county can come back, certainly, and say, well, the

2

reason we paid the matrons less was something having nothing

to do with their sex.

threshold level, raising an inference at this point.

were made up of both men and women and paid equally, and the

deputy sheriff force were made up of men and women, and paid

system?
MS. HEWITT:

Do you think a matron or

I think the system is challengeable but

they're going to have to show something that would lead you tc

believe, even on a prima facie case, that discrimination was

involved.

The problem you have with -QUESTION:

Well, you answered me a while ago that

23

the matron could certainly make out a case on that basis, if

Well, as I understand the difference ir.

in the matron situation we have two factors:

one, it's totally sex-segregated, and two, you have a level

less, so that's determined.

jobs.

Now, as I understand, in your

QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

Are you saying that both are prima facie':

10

MS. HEWITT:

I think it's more questionable whether

you have a prima facie case when you have a mix of males and

12

females and you're paying that particular job category less.

13

I'm not saying you can't do it, but I'm not

as clear that sex may have played a factor in the different

I do not think that

there's anything in the Bennett Amendment which can possibly

be construed to have such a broad result.

The only legisla­

10

tive history on the Bennett Amendment that is relevant is that

1 1

which was at the same time it was enacted, and that was

12

Bennett's proposal, that it was being introduced as a techni­

13

cal correction in order to avoid conflicts between the Equal

14

Pay Act and Title VII, and

15

a good idea because it incorporated the exceptions, and all it

16

did was incorporate the exceptions of the Equal Pay Act into

Title VII.

18

on that basis.

Dirksen's comment that this was

different wages for the same job in four instances

or any factor other

And that's what it authorized.
QUESTION: What's your response, then, to your

opponent's argument that that was already in the Act?
MS. HEWITT:

The first three, the seniority system

24

and the merit system, and the quantity or quality of produc­

25

tion, are already in Section 703(h) of Title VII.
35

The fourth

1

one, any factor other than sex, is not.

2

has said that that doesn't really mean anything because it's

3

just surplus verbiage, but that was certainly not the intent

4

of the law.
QUESTION:

5

And the petitioner

Well, it wouldn't be a violation of

6

Title VII if the alleged discrimination was based on a factor

7

other than sex -- race or --

8

MS. HEWITT:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Any other statutory criterion.

MS. HEWITT:

10

It's interesting that the defense of

1 1

any factor other than sex came out of the Equal Pay Act and

12

the Equal Pay Act says the same thing.

MS. HEWITT:

QUESTION:

20

MS. HEWITT:

22

So they obviously thought it meant

something, and it must mean the same thing --

21

It's surplusage in those cases, is the

argument.

What do you think it means?
And it has been -- well, It has been

What do you think it means if it says

23

"there shall be no violation of this Act

25

You don't have a vio­

MS. HEWITT:

if there is no

Well, I think it's been interpreted to
36

1

bear on the burden of going forward for the parties, and the

2

inference of sex being a factor created in a prima facie case

3

can be rebutted by showing that it's some factor other than

4

sex, under either Title VII or under the Equal Pay Act.

5

6

QUESTION:

And that would be true whether or not

that statutory provision were there or not.

7

MS. HEWITT:

But, I agree -- I think that in the

8

drafting of both statutes that there are some words that may

9

not have needed to be there, but I don't think that there's

10

anything that indicates that Congress intended the wholesale

11

change of Title VII which the petitioners' construction would

12

have.

13

of discrimination which should by the clear language of

14

703(a) be

15

never thought of that in the Equal Pay Act, and if they

thought about them they were not trying to deal with them,

and certainly not at the time they incorporated the Bennett

Amendment.

19

tion

20

intended to completely change Title VII to so limit the rights

21

for women and to provide protections for other protected

22

groups.

23

Now, there are lots and lots of kinds of instances

'recoverable under Title VII, but I'm sure Congress

And bear in mind that these types of discrimina­

would only affect women, and I don't think Congress

QUESTION:

Do you attach any significance to the

24

fact that the provision banning discrimination on the basis

25

of sex in Title VII was introduced by Congressman Howard Smith
37

1

from Virginia?
MS. HEWITT:

2

I subscribe fully to the theory that

3

he had in mind that he wanted the bill not to be enacted

4

because sex was included, but that isn't what happened, and I

5

don't think that too much can be put for that now at this

time.

are the only group protected by

12

MS. HEWITT:

13

QUESTION:

Title VII, where, for whom

That's correct.
And also, I think, since I've already

14

Interrupted you, as I understand your colleague's argument,

15

it is that the Equal Pay Act is the sole criterion only when

16

the claim is a differential In compensation, not where the

17

claim is something else, a promotion, or hiring, or whatever?

18
19

20

MS. HEWITT:

That's correct.

The Equal Pay Act

clearly speaks only to pay differentials.
QUESTION:

And your colleague's argument, even at

21

its broadest extent, would tell us that the Title VII is

22

satisfied if the Equal Pay Act is satisfied in a claim devotee

23

exclusively to differentials in compensation?

24

25

MS. HEWITT:

That's correct.

But there are a wide

variety of places in which that does not do women any good anc
38

1

this is a prime example, because they are sex-segregated jobs

2

and they can't just go out and find either a male comparator

3

in their own job or, in this case, even go to the corrections

4

officers' position.

5

QUESTION:

Incidentaly, Mrs. Hewitt, I thought you

6

-- did you not say earlier, there's not ever been a female

7

in the corrections officer's job?

8

ther's suggestion to us, however, that access to corrections

9

officers' jobs is available to females?
MS. HEWITT:

10

But what about your bro­

Our contention is that access'is illus-

1 1

sory.

We did not pursue that in the trial because it was not

12

really an issue, but the fact is that there never had been

13

one that really discouraged -QUESTION:

14

Well, is there any finding by either of

15

the lower courts that there is access to the corrections

16

MS. HEWITT

the corrections officer's position was open to women.

As a finding?
As a finding.
By whom, the district court?
By the district court.

That's correct.

And there have been, or are, women deputy

sheriffs?
MS. HEWITT

There are women deputy sheriffs, but
39

1

now that the deputy sheriffs fQr a time were in the jail doing

2

the corrections officers' job.

3

time, so there have never been any women on the male side of

4

the jail, but there are now women who are deputies who do the

5

general police patrol work.

There were no women at that

6

I think it's important to keep in mind in this case

7

the kinds; of discrimination in pay which Title VII would pro­

8

hibit if the petitioners' contention were correct. And that

9

includes the situation that even he mentioned, which is some­

10

one saying to an employee, I'm not going to pay you as much

11

as if you're a man.

12

you would have a discriminatory impact. For instance, if ah

13

employer determined that he was going to pay extra pay for

14

combat experience, which obviously would prejudice women,

15

under the analysis of the petitioner, that wohld be perfectly

all right.

I'd like to state the Government's interest in this

Stewart's question about the BFOQ.

the BFOQ analogy doesn't carry you very far in this area be­

cause -QUESTION:

16

And it seems to me that

Well, really, I agree with you, and the

17

only reason I raised that was to qualify the claim that women

18

are treated exactly like every other protected group under

Title VII.

to that generalized statement in the BFOQ, which is applicable

21

only to women.

MR. SULLIVAN:

And you can't give the same

under the Equal Pay Act, can you?

MR. SULLIVAN:

That's right.

But if you assume that

7

work forces are not made up of people who all have the same

8

jobs, as the Court assumed in Manhart --

9
10

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SULLIVAN:

-- then the point is that a good deal

1 1

of discrimination could be allowed to occur simply because

12

the jobs were not equal under the Equal Pay Act.

13

you assumed that the factor that is causing this discrimina­

14

tion is a factor that has absolutely nothing to do with the

15

duties that are being performed by the various people who are

16

working here, then it clearly would violate Title VII in our

17

view, but it would not violate the Equal Pay Act.

18

QUESTION:

And if

Mr. Sullivan, as I understand Mrs.

19

Hewitt's argument, she says that for her purposes she is

20

taking the scale, wage scale, already set by the county and

simply seeking to show that there has been discrimination on

22

the basis of sex under Title VII in it;

not require the courts to evaluate the relative worth of

MR. SULLIVAN:

simply one paradigm for proving a prima facie case of dis­

we're saying here, is that that's essentially a fact-bound

Is it your view that the term "comparable

The real question, however, is that the respondents

of what will be the standard to determine sex-based wage

14

The answer is --

QUESTION:

Mr. Derr, could I ask you, just to be

which there can be found a comparison job, even a hypothetical

QUESTION:

Specifically, in this case, it would not

violate either statute?
MR. DERR:

That's correct.

And the reason that we

7

take that position and the reason that that is the correct

8

position is not necessarily because that that's the policy

9

that we espouse or anyone else espouses, but Congress, Con­

10

gress fully considered that possibility and others, it looked

1 1

at the comparative worth, the comparative value, and it
