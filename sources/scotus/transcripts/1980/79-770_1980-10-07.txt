ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. LEVANDER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. LEVANDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case is here on the Government's petition to re­

11
12

view two decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for

13

the 4th Circuit.

14

variance clause promulgated by the Environmental Protection

15

Agency with regard to the so-called 1977 effluent limitations

16

required by the Clean Water Act.
At the outset I'd like to emphasize that there is no

17
18
19
20

At issue in this case is the scope of the

question in this case about the reasonableness or practicabil­
ity or validity of any technical or substantive regulation
promulgated by EPA.

The only question concerns this variance

clause.
21

The court below concluded in both cases that the
22

variance clause promulgated by EPA is invalid because EPA re­
23

fuses to consider the inability of an individual discharger to
24

afford compliance with the '77 limitations as a basis for
25

4

1

granting a variance.

Those decisions are in square conflict

2

with the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the
3

District of Columbia Circuit in the Weyerhaeuser case.

4

This Court has considered on several occasions the
5
6
7

complicated provisions of the Clean Water Act, recognizing that
it represents a bold attempt by Congress to clean up this
nation's waters.

As I said, it is a complicated act.

I would

8

like to begin by outlining the statutory framework which in­

9

forms this case.

10

11

There are three critical provisions to keep in mind.
Section 301(b), Section 304(b), and 301(c).

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LEVANDER:

Section 301(b) --

What was that second -304(b).

Section 301(b) directs the

14

Administrator to promulgate two sets of increasingly stringent

15

effluent limitations.

Those are the so-called 1977 and 1987

16

effluent limitations.

The Court recognized in duPont, or held

17

in duPont, that the regulations are to be promulgated on an

18

industry-by-industry basis or category-by-category basis, and

19

not on a plant-by-plant basis.

20
21
22
23
24
25

And the language and legislative

history of the Act shows that the difference in the stringency
between the regulations is approximated by that the '77 limi­
tations are to approximate if appropriate the average of the
best performers in the various subcategories of an industry;
whereas the 1987 regulations are to be based on the best per­
former in an industry with an eye, if possible, to eliminating
5

1

discharges altogether.
2
3

promulgation of these two sets of industry-wide effluent limi­
tations .

4
5

So, as I said, Section 301 requires the

Section 304(b) in turn sets forth factors that EPA
must consider in promulgating the industry-wide effluent limi­

6

tations.

7

requires that EPA consider such factors as the differences be­

8

tween plants, the ages of plants, the technologies used in those

9

plants, processes, and other similar factors.

As to both the '77 and '87 limitations, Section 304(b)

And in both cases

10

and most pertinent to this case, EPA must take into account the

11

cost of application.

12

in setting the industry-wide regulations in the crushed stone,

13

sand and gravel, and coal industries, which are before this

14

Court, that EPA did take into account quite extensively the

15

costs, total costs, of application.

16

And there's no dispute in this case that

The extensive administrative proceedings leading up tc

17

the promulgation of the regulations contain several reports by

18

independent analysts regarding the various industries, and this

19

is the procedure that EPA follows in every case.

20
21
22
23
24
25

These ensure

that no effluent limitations promulgated by EPA will substan­
tially undermine an industry or in any way shut down an industry
in toto or any substantial part.
For example, in the crushed stone industry and sand
and gravel industry combined, EPA considered that the total cost
of the 1977 limitations would be approximately $21 million, and
6

1

there are 10,000 dischargers in these combined industries.
2

QUESTION:

When you say an industry, you're not talk­

3

ing about a particular firm, you're talking about all of the
4

firms in the industry?

5
6
7

MR. LEVANDER:

All of the industry.

That's right.

And there are 10,000 of those in the two combined, crushed stone
and sand and gravel, approximately, and the estimate was that

8

the total cost to those 10,000 different firms would be about

9

$20 million, and that this would have an effect on the price of

10

the product that they sell somewhere between 2 and 8 percent, at

11

most.

12

And further, EPA goes even further than just esti­

13

mating the total impact and total cost to the industry.

14

estimates how many marginal firms may be forced to close because

15

they cannot afford compliance.

16

are about 4,800 crushed stone facilities and EPA estimated that

17

at most 35 marginal firms would be forced to close because they

18

could not afford to comply or otherwise would not want to comply

19

And these are all very small firms.

20
21

22
23
24
25

It alsc

As I indicated before, there

The EPA also estimated, with regard to the sand and
gravel industry, for example, that only 26 out of the more than
5,000 dischargers might be forced to close as a result of the
effluent limitation.
QUESTION:

The '77?

MR. LEVANDER:

That's the '77; that's right.
7

1

Now, that indicates that EPA takes very seriously the
2

requirement that it take into account total cost when it sets
3

the initial industry-wide regulation.

In fact, the proceedings

4

in these cases show that EPA rejected various requests by
5
6
7
8
9
10

11

environmental groups and others to regulate other kinds of pol­
lutants than those it chose eventually to regulate because they
were prohibitively expensive.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose, then, the EPA does think

it's relevant and significant how many marginal firms will be
put out of existence?
MR. LEVANDER:

That's right.

I mean, EPA would not

12

promulgate a regulation which would close down the industry

13

entirely, that no one in the industry could afford.

14

not a very realistic possibility because, in the first instance,

15

the guideline for the '77 limitations are existing firms which

16

have technology and the limitations based on existing use of

17

technology.

18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

And that's

In arriving at that conclusion, what was

the concept of total cost?
MR. LEVANDER:

The concept of total cost as evidenced

in the legislative history primarily is a kind of economic total
cost, the outlay of firms, capital costs, operating costs,
and also -QUESTION:

It would include economic dislocation of

unemployment ?
8

1

MR. LEVANDER:

Yes.

2
QUESTION:

Did it?

3

MR. LEVANDER:

It did in these cases.

Representative

4

Jones indicated that total cost also means total impact on the
5

6
7

8
9
10

economy as a whole in the regional economics.

Nothing in the

word "total cost," however, or in the legislative history sug­
gests —
QUESTION:

Well, but did they do all this before ar­

riving at the conclusion that there were only 28, if that's
the number -MR. LEVANDER:

That's right. There are very thick,

11

huge reports that they put out which analyze in detail the
12

economics of a particular industry.

And only having judged

13

that, they will not dislocate industry in toto and there will
14

not be massive dislocation,

do they promulgate a reasonable

15

and practicable regulation.
16

QUESTION:

And now, is there any difference in this

17

respect between the '77 limitations and the '87?
18

MR. LEVANDER:

Well, to some extent.

Again, EPA takes

19

into account on the '87, the cost of application.
20
21

22
23
24
25

quired to do so by statute and it does so.

It's re­

But the emphasis,

there's a slightly greater emphasis on costs with regard to the
'77 limitations.

MR. LEVANDER:

There has -- since in these industries

up till now the '87 limitations are approximating the '77 limi­

other hand, then, in other cases, Mr. Chief Justice, there could

5
6

That's right.

Suppose, instead of 27 and 35 it was 270

How would that alter this case?
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, at some point, if EPA initially

promulgated on the interim basis, not a final regulation, and
then they went out and they did an economic survey and they

10

saw that a substantial portion of the industry was going to be

11

closed down as a result of that, they would have to rethink the

12

level of technology and make it more affordable and reasonable

13

for the industry as a whole.
QUESTION:

14

You do concede that the statute with

15

respect to the 1977 limitations does require the agency to

16

weigh the total cost to the industry?
MR. LEVANDER:

17
18

and there's no dispute about that.
QUESTION:

1

20
21

22
23
24
25

That's correct, and that was done here,

And if the figures were such as suggested

by the Chief Justice as a hypothetical question, that could
affect the total — that could affect -- the total cost to the
industry?
MR. LEVANDER:

I am informed by the Administration

that in no case under the 1977 limitations did the economic
forecast show that anything more than 1 percent of an industry
12

1

would be closed as a result of the industry-wide level.
2

QUESTION:

If you had those larger figures, there

3

would be a further subanalysis to be made to determine whether
4

those were the marginal operators or whether they were average
5
6
7
8
9

all the way through the industry.
MR. LEVANDER:

Or it could turn out that upon promul­

gation they'll find out that they didn't know enough about the
industry as a whole, and so they have to go back and get some
more information, because when you have an industry of more thar

10

5,000 or 6,000 dischargers, as you have in these cases, you

11

can't -- they don't take into account every single discharger.

12

And so they might have to go back and get some more data or

13

whatever, or they'd have to rethink the process.

14

I said, in this case there's no question that the effluent

15

limitations which are not at issue here were reasonable and did

16

take into account total cost of application.

17

QUESTION:

But today, as

Suppose a given member of the industry is

18

determined by EPA to be unable to meet the prevailing 1977

19

standards, must EPA then grant a variance?

But the reason is, the question is, why

QUESTION:

If the --

Well, suppose they determine they can't,

what I'm trying to get to, is it your position that they need
not, even in that situation, grant a variance but merely to

1

consider that as one of other factors?
2

MR. LEVANDER:

No.

It depends, Mr. Justice Brennan --

have to have tremendously expensive pumping equipment to get

greater, maybe sixty times greater, than the average.

MR. LEVANDER:

Wouldn't he have to show that he had some

other proposal that would improve?
MR. LEVANDER:

saying that it would be dispositive, but would it be considered

And, I want to point

22
out

that Section 8 of the Act creates a $800 million revolving

23

loan fund which is administered by the Small Business Adminis­
24

tration.

Any firm under 250 employees who would otherwise have

25

16

to shut his plant or close his operations because he could not

afford to comply can go and get an SBA loan.

And that is a very

active program.

Going back to the statutory framework for a moment,
as I said before, 301 requires the industry-wide effluent limi­
tations, '77 and '87.

304(b) sets forth the factors that must

8

be taken into account as to both '77 and '87 costs of applica­

9

tion as relevant.

And Section 301(c), which is quite critical

10

to this case, provides the kind of affordability variance that

11

respondents seek here, but it only provides it with regard to

12

the '87 limitations.

MR. LEVANDER:

Well, that was a -- that was underlying

the problem in duPont, I think.

In duPont we suggested that

factors between one discharger and another that we hadn't taken

into account in setting the regulation.

But because we

And in a sense, for

There is no specific variance provision, and the 10th
Circuit in the Petroleum Institute case and some commentators
have suggested that no variances need be granted at all, and
there is some strength to that.

First of all, duPont's discus­

21

sion of the new sources under 306 indicated that the absence of
22

variance meant that no variances should be granted.
23

We still believe, however, that some variances should
24

and will be granted based on this fundamental difference factor.
25

But the express language of 301(c) , which is the critical pro­
2

vision here, which allows an affordability variance with regard

to the '87 limitations, does not apply to '77 limitations and
Congress clearly intended that the inability of a discharger to
afford compliance was not to be a factor with regard to the
'77 limitations.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Levander, looking at the govern­

8

ment policy as a whole here and including the Small Business

9

Administration loan, it isn’t going to be the kind of mom-and-

10

pop crushed stone operators that are hit,

11

the marginal ones, because they can get the loans.

12

to be ones conceivably who employ more than 250 people.

13

MR. LEVANDER:

when you refer to
It's going

That is conceivable although I'd like

14

to point out two things, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

15

anticipated at a minimum that the imposition of the 1977

16

effluent limitations will require as many as 300 major firms

17

employing up to 125,000 people to be put out of business because

18

they couldn't afford or did not wish to afford compliance with

19
20

21

22
23

the regulations.

First, Congress

So that's Congress's judgment that the clean

waters of this nation are more important than some of those
marginal firms.
And the second point is that in the facts of this case
I believe that all the firms that EPA anticipated would be
forced out of business were in fact smaller firms and I take it

24

that they were in such positions and so penurious that they
25

19

1

could afford even with a Section 8 loan or didn't wish to try
2
under a Section 8 loan to afford to comply.
3

The respondents rely on Section 304(b)(1)(B) as the
4

basis for their argument.
5

6
7
8
9

They say, the statute requires EPA

to take into account total cost; we agree, on the industry-wide
level.

And that under our own version of the variance, we have

to retake into account and reconsider every single factor on the
variance level.

And therefore we are trapped in our own Languag

3

and we must therefore grant these economic variances.

10

Well, there are several problems with that argument.

11

First, both the '77 and '87 limitations, actually Section

12

304(b)(1)(B) and -(b)(2)(B) require EPA to take into account

13

"cost of application."

14

meant, "and you must reconsider on the variance level," there

15

would have been no need for Congress to expressly create this

16

Section 301(c) variance, which it did create and which it create 1

17

only with regard to the '87 limitations.
The second problem is that respondents have miscon­

18
19

20

strued EPA's variance clause and a well-stated and firm position
all along.

25

I'll argue with you on that. That '87 Variane

clause puts another condition on them.

I should think that the general observation

would be, although I would not notice it judicially, that most

MR. LEVANDER:

I would guess that is absolutely cor­

rect, Mr. Chief Justice, although in terms of production there

are few firms, like 1 percent or 10 percent of one industry

produces 40 percent of the production.

So there are a few large

firms out there producing over a million tons a year.

QUESTION:

They might be large firms but each unit

these units — but each of the units is not likely to be over

I think that's probably correct.

And they'd each be operating under differ­

12

ent conditions with different drainage problems and different

supply problems.

MR. LEVANDER:

Well, but the regulation was set by

taking into account these variances.

Justice White, to come to the point that you just

not evidence of affordability in a variance proceeding, standing
alone, justifies a variance.

That has never been an argument

that we have made, it has never been a holding --

20

24

That's what duPont

What duPont said was, you have to look at the

structure of the Act as a whole to derive

implied

authority

for EPA to issue those '77 regulations in the first place.
And what the 4th Circuit said and what you affirmed
in duPont was that that implied authority was conditioned.

as this Court characterized it, saying the same thing, there­
fore you have to have a meaningful variance clause.

And the

logic of duPont is, and the logic of the Government's brief in
the recent Appalachian Power case, which I just argued against

them, is that a variance clause proceeding under 1977 regula­

MR. FREEMAN:

affordability in a variance

Under '77, for '77?
Yes, sir.

One of the statutory criteria

14

under 304(b)(1)(B) is — and I will try to quote it to be pre­

15

cise about it -- I'm quoting from the statute, "Total cost of

16
17
18
19
20

application of technology is relevant to the effluent reduction
benefits to be achieved from such application."
statutory cost benefit test.

Now that is a

It says, not that, some total costs

come in and you look to see what the resulting social benefits
are going to be.

And we believe that the word benefits here

means social benefits because the legislative history of the Act
21

shows clearly that

Congress wanted unemployment effects and

22

impacts on the local economy to be considered.
23

Now, if you make that showing, that still doesn't get
24

you home free.

And the Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit

25

27

1

recognized that.

It showed you've got to bring in evidence

2

under the other statutory criteria.

There are other factors in

3

there too.

This is just one of them.

And viewing them all as a

4

whole, you have the right to try to persuade EPA or the state
5

6
7

that a different limitation represents best practical tech­
nology for your plant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Freeman, let me ask you this.

8

MR. FREEMAN:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

What inferences, if any, could reasonably

10

be drawn from the fact that such a small percentage of the --

11

such a small segment of the industry in each case here is ad­

12

versely affected?

13
14
15
16
17

MR. FREEMAN:

Sir, we don't know how many people are

adversely affected here.
QUESTION:

If you will compare --

Well, we were given some figures.

Do you

challenge those figures?
MR. FREEMAN:

I do not challenge those figures as

18

being figures in the record.

19

that line, to compare the meticulous subcategorization which

20
21

22
23

But I will ask the Court, along

EPA went through with for the paper industry in Weyerhaeuser
y

with the sort of hit-or-miss, few-sample-plant type of subcate­
gorization they went through in the crushed stone industry and
in the coal industry.

And that's spelled out in our brief.

What this variance clause is all about, it permits EPA because
24

of the time pressures involved in issuing those '77 regulations
25

28

1

to make the kinds of oversimplifications and generalizations
2
3
4
5

that it has to make to issue those industry-wide regulations.
QUESTION:

Suppose, for example, that the record

showed that 1/10 of 1 percent of all the employees in the
industry, the employees, would be unemployed, out of business,

6

under the regulations, would—would that reasonably suggest

7

that the regulations were not unduly stringent?

8
9

MR. FREEMAN:

Oh, sir, I think that would suggest that

the regulations were probably all right.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FREEMAN:

Or even too loose?
Well, but the regulations meet one test.

12

At the permit-setting stage what we are looking for is to see

13

whether or not those general regulations which were roughly set

14

will create an anomaly under the statutory criteria that will

15

not make it best available controlled technology at this par­

16

ticular plant.

17

of our coal mines is going to be closed down, all the miners

18
19
20

If the plant is going to be closed down, if one

that work at the mine are put out of work,

the one town that

is dependent upon them bankrupted, and if we can show through
other evidence that the limitation that EPA is proposing here
at that particular mine not only will have that economic effect

21

but it won't do the water or the fish or people or anybody any
22

good, then we think that in that special circumstance the
23

variance clause is supposed to allow EPA to correct on a case24

by-case basis for the overgeneralization that it had to go
25

29

1

through in issuing these regulations --

QUESTION:

What do you make out of the example that

your colleague gave a few moments ago that the man who is on

the edge of a cliff, and if you really enforce the regulations
5

against him, he wouldn't get a permit and if he had to live up

to it he couldn't afford it?

'77 variance procedures that they might give him a special
treatment ?

Didn't he indicate that under the

MR. FREEMAN:

I didn't in any way understand him to

say that.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. FREEMAN:

Oh, you didn't.
And I know that in the cases that I've

13

had where I have tried to present evidence of those economic

14

effects, that EPA clearly will exclude it.

15

QUESTION:

And I think that --

Well, I asked him if he weren't talking

16

about the '87 variance and he said, no, he was talking about

17

the '77.

Then I assume that he's, what he said is that he

would have to undertake a very expensive pumping operation.
And if that isn't taking into consideration evidence of cost and
affordability, what is it?

than you thought, then.
MR. FREEMAN:

it clear that -QUESTION:

I perhaps misunderstood him.

MR. FREEMAN:

— that evidence would not be admissible

in a variance proceeding.
QUESTION:

What do you think he meant by it?

What was

his cliff example all about?
MR. FREEMAN:

I don't know.

I would say this, sir.

3

The way I took his reference to mean, because my problem is,

4

I've argued this thing over and over again and I get different

5

examples each time -- it is not our argument -- and maybe he's

6

saying here, if all you can show is that you are on the edge of

7

the cliff and if you have to comply with the regulations, you

8

get pushed off the cliff under our theory and as I understand

9

the Government's theory, you get pushed off the cliff.

20
21

22
23

You have

to show something more.
So what's at issue here is, do we have evidence -- do
we have the right in a variance proceeding to show that we're
going to get pushed off the cliff as well as to show that we
shouldn't be pushed off the cliff because of the other statutory

24

factors as well in 304(b)(1)(B)?

In a variance clause proceeding.

That

is the logic of their position and -QUESTION:

13

And

do you say that they will decline to consider that?

10

12

350 of them will be out of work.

Well, do they in fact?
-- it' s what they state

clearly time and

time again.
QUESTION:

Do they in fact and in practice have they

refused tenders of evidence of that kind?
MR. FREEMAN:

Well, we have pointed out, sir, and in

16

certain cases of inconsistency on EPA's part -- because one of

17

the things that it has argued here is the presumption of

18

validity to its own regulation, which changes daily, but, in

19

some of the cases, we pointed out that they had admitted evi­

20

dence of that.

And in footnote 9 to their reply brief, they

said, yes, there was such a case.

interpretation and reading of our regulations.

And that means

And --

Mr. Freeman, it seems to me we've got

another problem that we haven't talked about yet.

13

MR. FREEMAN:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

At one stage of the proceeding I thought

15

the question was whether affordability was a sufficient ground

16

for a variance.

17

affordability was relevant at all.

18

they won't even admit evidence of unaffordability to be received

19

in a proceeding.

20

dealing with a regulation and not a specific concrete dispute,

21

22
23
24
25

Another stage I thought the question was whether
Now you're telling us that

And one of the problems I have is, we're

and I'm seriously concerned about the question of .whether the .con­
troversy is ripe.

And one of the reasons is, I think you kind

of shift the arguments as the proceeding goes, and your point
about whether or not there is disagreement between the Court of
Appeals for the D. C. Circuit and the 4th Circuit emphasizes
33

1

that to my mind.

I have difficulty knowing whether --

2
MR. FREEMAN:

If I may have — yes, sir -- well, if

3

I may address that because I think you are wrong, and I think
4

what happened is that the D. C. Circuit and the Court of Appeals
5
6
7

for the 4th Circuit arrived at the same point, namely that all
of this evidence under 304(b)(1)(B) had to be considered.
They both reached the same conclusion that evidence of afforda­

8

bility was relevant to total cost, that component in the cost/

9

benefit test that's in 304(b)(1)(B).

10

The 4th Circuit following -- you remember, it started

11

this whole thing with duPont — and it looked mainly in duPont

12

not to legislative history but to the overall scheme of the Act

3

to see whether EPA had this implied authority to issue the

4

regulations in the first place.

5

months after it decided duPont it picked up right where it was

6

and said, looking at the overall scheme of the Act as a whole,

7

we think the concept of affordability -- that is, evidence of

8

affordability -- clearly ought to be admissible under total cost

being able to get away to have it considered under the more
stringent limitation without having it taken into account under
'77.

We think that the reference in the 4th Circuit opinions in

Appalachian has to be viewed in that context, that is, its ref­
erence to 301(c) said that evidence of affordability has to be
considered under the statutory criteria language of total cost

25

in relation to resulting effluent benefit.

And it's clear to

2
us that Weyerhaeuser reached that point a different way, because
3

it had benefit of your decision in duPont and the benefit of
4

7

EPA's shift in its interpretation of the regulations to permit
the consideration of economic evidence. So it simply took the
shorthand route and looked at legislative history with regard to
total cost.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE L. GARRETT
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS NATIONAL CRUSHED STONE ASSOC. ET AL.

13

Mr. Garrett.

MR. GARRETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
QUESTION:

Before you go on, let me pursue the hypo­

14

thetical if not real question posed by Mr. Justice Stevens.

15

Should the Court try to decide this kind of issue on abstrac­

16

tions as distinguished from a case in which, a specific case in

17

which evidence were tendered that 350 out of 500 people in a

18

particular town would be unemployed because of the closure of

19
20
21

22
23

a coal mine, rather than trying to pass on the regulations in
the abstract?

If you'd care to comment on that at some point

in your presentation?
MR. GARRETT:

Well, I'll address it now, since it

seems to be on your mind.

It is true that the variance clause

as it was contained in the regulations before the 4th Circuit
24

had a certain amount of vagueness to it.
25

35

It talked about

1

fundamentally different factors without indicating what those
2
were.

And indeed, when we argued the case in the 4th Circuit,

3

one of the problems that we had with the variance clause is that
4

it was vague.
5

6
7

8
9

You couldn’t tell what the grounds were for the

granting of a BPT variance.

Now, with respect to the ripeness

question, I think that that problem has been solved because EPA
in 1979 published regulations under its MPDS program applicable
to all industries and specifying in detail what factors will
and will not be considered in granting a variance.

You can look

10

at 40 CFR, Section 125.31, and in particular Section 31(e).

11

In that provision of EPA's regulations, which are binding on

12

the agency and express its position, state unequivocally that

13

the inability of a particular plant to afford costs of compli­

14

ance will not be grounds for a variance.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Will not be grounds, but will it be receive d

and weighed, along with other factors?
MR. GARRETT:

The Agency’s regulations say not, and I

18

think that if you read the preamble to the Agency's 1979

19

regulations, it makes it absolutely clear.

20
21

22
23
24
25

The regulations

say that a variance will only be considered if there are funda­
mentally different factors.

And the Agency's regulations go on

to state that economic affordability under no circumstances can
be considered fundamentally different.
QUESTION:

This is for the '77 variance?

MR. GARRETT:

Yes.

This is for the 1977 variance.
36

1

QUESTION:
2
3
4

Different from the '87?

MR. GARRETT:

Is that right?

I believe that's right. Of course, the

Agency’s position is that 301(c) supersedes its variance clause
for '83.

5

QUESTION:

Well, is your response to be taken as

6

saying that if the EPA declined to receive evidence of the hypo­

7

thetical I suggested, economic factors on the town, that would

8

be error?

9

Or -MR. GARRETT:

Well, it would be consistent with its

10

own regulations and the Agency would be bound to follow those

11

regulations.

are invalid and that's why we're before the Court.

13

we would have a situation where this very issue before the Court

14

would be litigated in hundreds of individual proceedings and

15

indeed it's not clear that it could be litigated, because

How did you understand the example that the Solicitor General
presented, the 100-foot cliff example?
MR. GARRETT:

there was a technological factor -QUESTION:

It's just he's on a cliff

MR. GARRETT:

10

you read EPA's regulations as I just cited them.

11

to me clear on their face --

12
13

QUESTION:

And so you're suggesting the Solicitor

General isn't following his own regulations, in this example?

14

MR. GARRETT:

15

QUESTION:

16

And it seems

Well, I think that you'd better ask him.

Well, I thought it was fair, I thought it

was fair to ask you.
MR. GARRETT:

17

I had understood it in a different way.

18

I understood him to be saying that they would consider costs

19

but not the question of affordability.
QUESTION:

20
21

22
23
24
25

You mean, if the fellow who is putting in

the evidence couldn't go on and say, furthermore, I can't afford
this ?
MR. GARRETT:

That's exactly right.

And that's what

I understand the brief to say.
QUESTION:

But that they might give him a variance
38

1

because it was more expensive for him?
2

MR. GARRETT:

That's correct.

On the other hand, on

3

the other hand, if the Government could show that it were not
4
5
6
7

more expensive for some strange reason, then the affordability
question would be irrelevant and he might not be entitled to a
variance.

You have two companies, one

the two.

9

MR. GARRETT:

Well, I just think that all other

10

factors being equal it might be dispositive, yes, recognizing

11

the fact that there is a certain amount of discretion that the

12

Agency has and that it's hard to find two plants that are in

13

identical circumstances with respect to the impact on receiving

14

waters and other factors.

for us.
MR. GARRETT:

17
18
19

20
21

22
23

I'm sure Mr. Levander will clear it up

The difficulty that we have with the

Agency's regulations is that the Agency says that it will grant
the variance based on a number of factors, and they enumerate
them, including engineering, process factors, land availability,
and so forth.

Yet the one issue that they -- as we understand

it -- refuse to consider in current permits is the question of
whether or not the discharger can pay for the required control
equipment.

The Agency will not consider the issue even if the

24

resulting controls will result in no benefit to the environment.
25

41

1

Now, the Agency says, oh, yes, we'll consider finan­
2
cial inability as a factor in 1984 but not now.

This is hardly

3

any consolation to a plant that's forced to close now because
4

they cannot afford BPT permit requirements.
5

Now, Shakespeare once said, "Those who die seldom
6

do, or never recover."

7
8
9

We submit that it's totally arbitrary for EPA that
it will consider every relevant factor except the one that means
the very survival or extinction of a company.

Now, it seems

10

to me that there is a tradition of fair play in America that

11

allows persons to be heard on matters of significance.

12

think that EPA's position here is at odds with that tradition.

3

It's inconceivable to me that Contress would have delegated to

4

EPA the authority to shut down a plant without a hearing at

5

least on this issue, not in cases where they are in clear vio­

6

lation of tha law, not in a situation where a plant is endan­

7

gering human health, but simply because a small businessman

8

cannot obtain financing or otherwise afford the cost involved.
Now, there's been a lot said about the statutory

structure.
that.

I'd like to simply make a couple of points regarding

The 1977 standard is supposed to be practicable and in

turn the Agency notes that it's not anticipated that large
numbers of plants will be forced to close as a result of BPT.
In contrast, by 1984, the standards are supposed to be more
stringent and reflect the best available technology economically

25

42

1
achievable, and to ensure that firms will not be forced to close.

2
Congress provided in Section 301(c) for an explicit variance
3

from the 1984, or the Government refers to them as the 1987
4

limits on grounds of affordability.
5

Now there are two key respects in which the regula­
6
7

tions depart from this scheme and in turn those departures re­
late to two independent grounds for affirming the decision below

8

First of all, EPA's initial BPT regulations often go very far

9

beyond what is practicable.

In the case of the crushed stone

10

industry, for example, EPA adopted BPT regulations that require

11

zero discharge of process water, and they publish the identical

12

regulations planned for the 1984 standards.
Now, contrary to the Government's suggestion that the

13
14

regulations were upheld in all respects, certainly the 4th

15

Circuit found that in major respects the crushed stone regula­

16

tions were unreasonable.

17

hundreds of small privately owned businesses.

18

regulations would close many plants that cannot afford the costs

19
20

involved.

The crushed stone industry contains
And EPA's

We strenuously disagree with Government counsel that

the costs were fully considered by the Agency or that the
impact would be small.

21

And on that, I would point out a couple of factors
22
since it's been brought up as an issue this morning.

The Agency

23

acknowledges that the greatest impact of its regulations will
24

fall on small plants.

Indeed, the Agency predicted that there

25

43

1

would be 35 closures within its small plant category.

Its

2
economic analysis had several categories of plants, the smallest
3

of which was the so-called small plant category, and this con­
4

sisted of a 100,000 ton-per-year plant.
5
6

QUESTION:

How does that translate into number of

employees?

7

MR. GARRETT:

I'm not sure, Mr. Justice Burger, but

8

it's relevant with respect to EPA's economic analysis, and the

9

adequacy of that analysis, that on-third of the industry --

10

some 1,600 companies -- are composed of plants that produce

11

less than 25,000 tons per year, far smaller than studied by EPA

12

even in its smallest small plant economic analysis.

13

words, this is a category of plants that was never studied by

14

EPA.

15

have a financial psoition that is significantly different from

16

that studied by the Agency.

today, then plants in this subcategory will never have a chance

18

to have EPA or state or anyone consider whether they're funda­

QUESTION:

of statutory construction.
MR. GARRETT:

I think the case can be disposed of

as a matter of statutory construction but I -QUESTION:

I thought that's what the issues were.

MR. GARRETT:

That is the issue.

I would just simply

6

point out that, as I mentioned earlier, that I can't conceive

7

that Congress intended to delegate to EPA the power to make

8

these kinds of decisions without considering this factor and

9

without even affording the company an opportunity for hearing.

10

QUESTION:

But there's no due process argument, or

11

there's no argument that there's a taking without compensation,

12

or anything like that.

13

MR. GARRETT:

14

QUESTION:

15
16
17
18
19

Well --

Is there or isn't there?

MR. GARRETT:

Not as such, although the issue is

going to surface in one proceeding or the other, which was
getting to my second point.

There is a relationship here, an

interrelationship between the setting of the national standards
and the allowance of a variance.

The courts have in many

cases upheld national regulations considering EPA's data base
20

and the way in which EPA evaluated the evidence on the grounds
21

that, well, maybe this was less than perfect, but in situations
22

where it isn't perfect, where there might be a taking or there
23

might be a problem of insufficient consideration for statutory
24

factors, that'll be accounted for in the variance proceedure.
25

45

1
The implications of EPA's positions, it seems to me,

2
are going to be to put an enormous burden on the initial regula-'
3
4
5

6
7

tion-setting stage, because if companies realize that the possi­
bility of a variance is really illusory, that EPA has to have
done superb economic analysis in the first instance, otherwise
they're never going to be heard on the question of afforda­
bility, you're going to have extensive litigation and rule-mak­

8

ing proceedings on the extent to which EPA conducted an ade­

9

quate economic analysis.

10

11

It seems to us that at some stage these issues must be
considered.

12

Now, the Agency's justification apparently is that

13

since the statute allows for a variance and for BAT in 1984,

14

and it's silent for BPT as to 1977, that that's dispositive on

15

the question.

16

such a result and that the decision of the 4th Circuit should

17

be upheld.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Now you'll clarify this

problem for us, Mr. Levander.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. LEVANDER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
MR. LEVANDER:

Yes.

Before I do that I'd like to

make one point, if I might, Mr. Chief Justice, or two points.
The first point is that nothing in their brief — at
least I read it several times, and I could find nothing about
46

1

any constitutional question, any delegation question; this is
2
simply a matter of statutory construction.
3

The second point is, as this Court made very clear in
4

the duPont opinion, under the Clean Water Act the question is
5

6
7
8
9

not what we think is an appropriate way to regulate; it is what
Congress said and what Congress did.

And here the language of

the Act, although somewhat complicated, strongly supports EPA's
position and the legislative history, which has not been dis­
cussed here at all, is simply overwhelming.

The report, the

10

conference report -- Senator Muskie, who was quo.ted with

11

approval in this Court's dupont opinion at page 130 and page

12

129, and other consistent statements by Congressmen over and

13

over and over again reflect three things, one, that these regu­

14

lations would force certain marginal economically inefficient

15

companies out of business; two, that in order to sort of

16

appease that problem to some extent, Congress created Section 8

17

financing.

18

are a problem because -- and it's exactly the situation where

19

you have a little fellow who's going to go out of work and it's

20

very sympathetic, that it's hard to deny him a variance.
Nonetheless, Congress made a determination that he

21
22
23

Senator Nelson introduced that bill saying variances

would be denied a variance unless he could gel: the Section 8
funding.
And three, over and over and over again -- and I

24

direct the Court's attention to page 7 and 8 of the reply brief
25

47

1

in particular.

There's just statement after statement that the

2
economic affordability will not be reconsidered on a plant-by3

plant basis.
4

QUESTION:
5

legislative history?

6
7
8
9

Are there some contrary indications in the

MR. LEVANDER:

No.

The only contrary indications

that are put out by respondent are post-adoptive legislative
history.

And even as to that, I think it is indicative of the

weakness of their psoition.

They claim that in 1977 when

10

Congress amended the Act that it thoroughly considered and

11

approved and acquiesced in the 4th Circuit Appalachian Power

12

decision.

13

Now, the basis of that claim is three things.

First,

14

the Congress didn't expressly disapprove it in 1977, so we have

15

this legislative silence which is supposed to be dispositive.

16

Second, that a Congressman got up on the floor of the House and

17

waved a 126-page Library of Congress report which indexes 144

18

reported decisions, including the Appalachian Power decision

19

and including decisions that suggested that the variance clause

20

21

22
23

was valid on the same page, and said that this repor>t he found
it very useful to understand the Act, saying nothing about the
Appalachian Power decision.

And on the basis of this we are

supposed to assume that Congress was aware of and acquiesced
in this decision.

24

QUESTION:

Would the Government be satisfied if we

25

48

1

adopted the formulation of the problem of the D.C. Circuit
2
with which you say this 4th Circuit is in conflict?
3

MR. LEVANDER:

Yes.

I think the D.C. Circuit deci­

4

sion is correct that -- and this is the part I explain what the
5

6
7
8

difference is -- EPA will take into account all kinds of funda­
mental differences directly related to compliance which affect
the cost, that is, the financial outlay that a discharger would
have to spend in order to comply.

9

Another example --

So you take evidence of cost as relevant?
Cost of compliance.

And you do -- would you agree with Brother

Stevens that it will be determinative sometimes?
MR. LEVANDER:

16

That is correct.

What we will not

17

take into account, the discharger's bankbook, which is to say

18

we will not take into account affordability, his ability to

19
20

21

afford, so that if you had four dischargers in an industry,
all of them identical, and one of them was simply economically
inefficient and had wasted money or didn't have money or was
incompetent or whatever his problem is --

22

QUESTION:

23

costs?

Does the cost of compliance include capital

Interest costs?

24

MR. LEVANDER:

Well, that, of course, I answer by

25

49

1

Section 8 financing which is available, so that the person
2
who couldn't get monies for -3

QUESTION:

No, no, not in whether there's financing,

4

but in determining costs, are capital costs an item that you're
5
6
7
8
9

looking at?

Which in turn may vary from company to company, as

you know.
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, that's a closer question as to

whether his lack of money, we don't take into account.

Now, if

he were to show that for some reason he was different from the

10

rest of the industry in his ability to get financing and that

11

was not satisfied by Section 8, that's a question I don't think

12

EPA's passed upon, but my answer would be that he would not

3

be entitled to a variance simply because his cost of money was

4

11 percent versus 12 percent or 10 percent.

5
6

QUESTION:

So if he offers his operating statement

for the past five years, you reject it?

That's right.

What we want to know --

But if he wants to tell you how much it's

going to cost him?
MR. LEVANDER:

That we want to know, and that's the

basis for variances and that's what

will keep these claims of

all these industries -QUESTION:

Even though in making up the regulation
50

1

you wanted all those operating statements?
2
MR. LEVANDER:

In taking into account we analyze the

3

total cost of application, which includes the industry-wide
4

outlay to afford compliance.

And we also, in addition, we have

5

discretion under 304(b) to take into account any other relevant

You don't think the fact that he'll go out

of business triggers the necessity to consider some of the
other factors?
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, I think it heightens the analy­

sis on the variance proceeding, but it's simply irrelevant -QUESTION:

Well, then, how can you say you don't

want to see his operating statements?
MR. LEVANDER:

We don't.

It's not affordability.

Congress made the determination that affordability is only a
