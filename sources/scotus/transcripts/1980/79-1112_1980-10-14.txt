ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. WALLACE:

9

10

We'll next hear No. 79-1112,

This case is factually very similar

to Parker against Flook.
QUESTION:

1 1

Mr. Wallace, let me -- since you've had a

12

half-hour of argument and are going to have another half hour,

13

I feel more at liberty to interrupt you at the very beginning.

14

Let me ask you the same question that I did of your opponent

15

in the prior case, do you think the patent law of 101 is dif­

16

ferent for computers than it is for other patentable objects?
MR. WALLACE:

puters.

I don't think it's different for com­

As I mentioned in the last case, there have been

patents issued on new computer machines.

This case cites

examples of patents that have been issued on processes in volving the use of a computer as being the prior art that
anticipated everything claimed in this process other than the
algorithm, the new program.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, what is an algorithm?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we've talked about this in
3

1

the past.

definition in our brief in Bradley from a manual on computers.

3

For purposes of dealing with the computer technology, we

roughly equate it to a computer program, because it's a

sequence of step-by-step mathematical sequences to be performed

by the digital computer.

The Court defined it in Benson.

15
16

thing that a digital computer can function, with respect to -QUESTION:

MR. WALLACE:

23
24

It was a claim on a composition of

matter rather than a process.
QUESTION:

21

22

Did Chakrabarty involve a process, a com­

position of matter?

19

20

The

program is a sequence of mathematical steps, which is the only

17

18

We've attempted some in our brief in Bradley, to

When you compose disparate elements, is

that -- ?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, in one sense, any machine or any

composition of matter is a process.

But for purposes of patent

law, the two are in separate categories.
25

4

Scientifically, it's

1

true that process is involved in any of them.

2
3

QUESTION:

But this is a machine patent in the terms

of the patent law?

4

MR. WALLACE:

That was true in the preceding case.

5

In this, the present case, the Diehr case involves a process

6

claim.

It's much closer in form --

QUESTION:

8

MR. WALLACE:

9

To Flook.
-- to Flook, and differs in that

respect from Chakrabarty.
QUESTION:

10

Now, in Flook the Court summarized its

1 1

own holding by saying, very simply, "Our holding today is that

12

a claim for an improved method of calculation even when tied

13

to a specific end use is unpatentable subject matter under

14

Section 101."

15

holding.
MR. WALLACE:

16

17

That's the way the Court itself summarized its

18 of the opinion.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WALLACE:

20

21

24

25

Right.
And that is the sentence that the

Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has accepted as the limit
of the holding.
QUESTION:

22
23

That is the last sentence of Footnote

That's what the Court said its holding

was.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I understand that.

What we

regard as the interpretation of Section 101 that I've referred
5

1

to in Flook is in the two paragraphs of the text of the Court's

2

opinion, on pages 593 and 594 of that volume.

3

portion of the opinion that the Court of Customs and Patent

4

Appeals has declined to follow in analyzing subsequent cases,

5

instead relying on this sentence that you just read,

6

Mr. Justice, from a footnote in the opinion.
QUESTION:

7

And that is the

Well, the Government thought that in the

8

Chakrabarty arguments that the Court of Customs and Patent

9

Appeals hadn't followed Flook but really didn't seem to have

10

the credence to go with that.
MR. WALLACE:

1 1

I'm aware of what the arguments were

12

last term in Chakrabarty.

I see nothing in the Court's

13

opinion, however, that really has much bearing on the issue in

14

this case, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

QUESTION:

Well, what about the statement in Chakrabart/

16

that "Flook did not announce any new principle that inventions

17

in areas not contemplated by Congress when patent laws were

18

enacted are per se unpatentable"?
MR. WALLACE:

19

20

21

Court in the present case by any party, but I don't see that
there's much bearing here.
QUESTION:

22
23
24

25

There's no such contention before the

Aren't you pretty close to that, your

argument?
MR. WALLACE:

I thought what we were arguing is that

this Court's interpretation of Section 101 in Flook
6

1

requires an inquiry to be made in the processing of patent

2

claims to see whether the claim of novelty inheres in a scien­

3

tific principle, formula, or other aspect of what this Court

4

has referred to as "the basic currency of technological

5

advance," which cannot be preempted through patent claims.

6

And what was at issue basically in Flook, as we un­

7

derstand it, was whether the questions of novelty and obvious­

8

ness under Sections 102 and 103 would be the only possible

9

limitations on efforts to exclude others from the use of sci­

10

entific principles and mathematical formulas.

1 1

were related to end uses in the patent claims and the inquiries

12

under 102 and 103 showed them not to be obvious and to be new,

13

then others could be excluded from using those scientific

14

principles in relation to those particular end uses; or whether

15

Section 101 precluded claimants from trying to exclude others

16

from the use of these basic elements of scientific knowledge

17

even though they have novel claims to it.

18
19

QUESTION:

And if those

Well, I don't see -- Mr. Wallace, I didn't

understand that was what was at issue in Flook and I'm not sure
that the Court understood it that way.

-As Justice Stevens has

suggested by his question this morning, what Flook decided was,
where the only claim of the applicant for a patent is something
that's just a better method of calculating, you can do it fas­
ter on a computer than you can do it with a pencil and paper,
for example, then that's not patentable subject matter under 101.

MR. WALLACE:

dissenting

question:

The Court specifically addresses this

"Respondent argues that this approach" — namely,

10

the Court's approach -- "improperly imports into Section 1

1 1

the considerations of inventiveness which are the proper con­

12

cerns of Sections 102 and 103.

This argument is based on two

13

fundamental misconceptions..."

Then the succeeding two para­

14

graphs are what we consider to be the heart of this Court's

15
16

interpretation of Section 101 adopted in the Flook case, and
which is the bone of contention here.
Unless the Flook holding is to be merely a guide to

17

18
19

20
21

22
23

the drafting of claims, obviously anyone can avoid drafting his
claim

so that the only thing claimed is the new formula or

new scientific principle, and the Board of Patent Appeals, in
order to make the holding something meaningful, has, we think,
quite rightly construed it necessarily to mean that they have
to analyze the claims to see whether the only thing that is
novel in the claims is the scientific principle, formula, or

24

other fundamental truth.

1

QUESTION:

Well, isn't it pretty well settled that

2

the scope of a patent is to be measured by the claims of the

3

applicant ?
MR. WALLACE:

4

Well, they do measure it by the claims

5

but they analyze the claims in light of the prior art, and it's

6

all part of the examination of the prior art.
QUESTION:

7

8

The prior art has something to do with

novelty and obviousness and things like that.
MR. WALLACE:

9

It does.

The Patent Office makes the

10

inquiry for Section 101, 102, and 103 purposes all in the same

1 1

examination of prior art.

12

novel, unobvious formula or scientific truth involved, if

13

that's the only novelty that inheres in the claims in light

14

of that examination of prior art, then it's not patentable

15

subject matter under Flook.

drafting of claims and scientific principles and formulas will

18

be precluded through skillful drafting of patent claims.

But even if there's a claim to a

That is our understanding of

Otherwise, Flook becomes nothing but a guide to the

The reason we brought Flook to the Court in the first
place was because Benson had left this question unclear and
had gone strictly with the CCPA on it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, when would — when could you

get a patent for a process or a machine that as one of its
elements has unpatentable subject matter in it?

You don't say

that just because a patent, the claims of a patent include
9

1

2

an element that's unpatentable, that there's no patent?
MR. WALLACE:

No.

Of course, if there's novelty

3

other than novelty in the scientific principle or fundamental

4

truth, then, of course, it's a proper claim under 101 --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. WALLACE:

7

8
9

Well, what if there's no novelty --- and then their question of 'Obvious­

ness and so forth .is addressed.
QUESTION:

Well, what if you take the elements apart

and you don't find any novelty in any one claim or one element

10

except in the unpatentable

11

in the combination?

12

13
14

subject matter, but there's novelty

Can that --

MR. WALLACE:

There can be novelty in a combination

that will support a patent.
QUESTION:

You don't think either one -- here you

15

say there's neither novelty in any other element nor in the

16

combination?

17

18

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

20

MR. WALLACE:

21

QUESTION:

23
24

25

The finding

is that the novelty inhered only in the program itself --

19

22

Nor in the combination.

It's another Flook.
— and that is our position.

Well, what, Mr. Wallace, if an applicant

for a patent said -- it's a machine that previously, all pre­
vious machines had used spring-wind, spring-wound mechanisms tc
open a gate, say.

And this applicant said, the difference

now in this combination is that I use gravity to do it.
10

1

Would that be patentable or not?

2

MR. WALLACE:

3

it's hard for me to know --

The difference is, it uses gravity and

it used to be spring-actuated.

And that's

what I thought was the prevailing view in this Court in
deciding the case and explaining the basis for its decision.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, there are some writers who

purport to be authorities, on the subject who said that what
the central element of Flook was that when the courts are
dealing with areas not foreseen by Congress, the Court should
12

1

go very slowly and that was reiterated in Chakrabarty.

2

do you have to say about that?

3

MR. WALLACE:

That is not our position.

I can't

say about Flook.

briefs and in the course of our argument, that Flook involved

QUESTION:

17

18
19

20

MR. WALLACE:

23
24

I don't see that Chakrabdrty under­

took to repudiate that interpretation of Section 101, Mr.
Chief Justice.

I understand that the Government argued for a

contrary result in Chakrabarty, but I think that the result
reached in Chakrabarty is entirely consistent with the Court's
interpretation Of .Section 101 in Flook -QUESTION:

21

22

Then Chakrabarty was a dubious holding

under your present view?

15
16

The interpretation is

QUESTION:

No, but -- I understand that but you are

now answering a different question than I asked you.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the computer program itself would

not be patentable.
QUESTION:

Nor any other computer program that you

can think of?
MR. WALLACE:

For a digital computer, that is correct

because it involves a sequence of mathematical steps.
QUESTION:

Whether it was described as a machine

patent or a process patent?
MR. WALLACE:

Whether the program was described

either way, that is correct, Mr. Justice.
14

Computer machines

are patentable, novel machines.

of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals interpreting Benson

24

The dissenting opinion in Flook, as a matter of fact,

In looking at those cases again and comparing them
with the present opinion and other post-Flook opinions of that
court, the striking thing to us is, how little difference there
is in the analysis approach an

approach being used by the

Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.
Prior to the decision in Flook that dourt took the
view that the holding in Benson was really limited to an effort
to wholly preempt a mathematical formula.

25

15

The same basic

analysis has been used in subsequent cases , although the Court

2

does recognize that under Flook

4

.if

the claim is on the

•because it's limited to particular end uses then Flook does

5

have to control that kind of case.

But the kind of analysis

6

described in the portions of the Court's opinioni that I've

7

referred to in detail here, when it's used by the Board of

8

Appeals, as we think it should be under this Court's decision,

9

has been criticized by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals

10

and they have really limited the holding to those two basic

1 1

propositions, that if the claim is of a mathematical formula

12

or would wholly preempt a mathematical formula, then those

13

decisions would preclude the granting of a patent.

14

the analysis should proceed the way it did in the pre-Flook

15

cases.

16
17

18
19

20

21
22

Otherwise

And that is what we seek clarification of in bringing
these cases here today, because our understanding of the Courth
interpretation of Section 101 in Flook and what we were asking
the Court to do in Flook is ;quite different from that.

And the

way the Patent Office, has been administering. Flook is quite
different from that.
I think I'd like to reserve -QUESTION:

Well, before you sit down, let me just ask

23

a question about the difference between this case and Flook.
24

Flook suggested that the analysis
25

16

would proceed by assuming

1

that the formula was in the prior art 'or was well known and

2

then looking for something else that was claimed to have been

3

discovered.

4

Here everybody agrees that the formula for figuring

5

out how long to cure the rubber was well known.

The -- I for­

6

get the name of the formula -- but that was well known.

that a computer could make use of this well-known formula when

Davis and Gould application referred to on page 9 of our brief
had described the use of a computer to do this similar_thipg.
And what the Board found here to be the contribution, to be
the novel thing, was the devising of the computer program.
Both the Board and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals
agreed that the application indeed disclosed a computer program.
The Board found that to be the only contribution, the only
novel thing in light of the prior art in this application.
The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals refused to pass on that

question because it thought that inquiry was beside the point.

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13

MR. WICKERSHAM:

14

15

Mr. Wickersham.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The case does indeed involve the statutory construc­

on that.

Both Gottschalk v. Benson and Parker v. Flook make
it clear that one index of having a process which is patentable subject matter is the transformation of state, changing
something from one thing to quite another thing.

Now, this

messy, circular piece of uncured synthetic rubber is our
starting material, or one of the starting materials.

I don't

know that you can use it for anything except to make something

else out of it.

QUESTION:

Would you help me out at this point?

MR. WICKERSHAM:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun?

What is the difference between your

3

claimed method for updating cure time, so to speak, and the

4

method for updating the alarm limits held unpatentable in

5

Flook?
MR. WICKERSHAM:

6

Well, there are quite a few dif­

7

ferences in there.

The first is that our claimed method is

8

a claim for a process for molding a precision synthetic rubber

9

product, whereas, as noted in the majority opinion particu­

10

larly, the alarm limit is a number and the claim was directed

1 1

in that, to calculating a number and then by some means or

12

other which could have been manual simply resetting the alarm,

13

which is a post-solution step.
In that case the only novelty was said to be the

14

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

equation.

In our case the equation is certainly not novel.

We contend that the combination has been held novel by the
examiner since he withdrew his 103 rejection on the grounds
of obviousness, and he never did make a 102 rejection showing
that he didn't believe that there was any lack of novelty in
our case.

Does that answer the question, Mr. Justice Blackmun?

I don't want to answer something you didn't ask, instead.
QUESTION:

Well, that's an answer.

I don't know

whether it satisfies me, but it's an answer.
MR. WICKERSHAM:
QUESTION:

Very good; all right.

I am having difficulty distinguishing

25

22

1

this case from what the Court held in Flook.

2

MR. WICKERSHAM:

I see.

Well, I have -- I feel I

have very little difficulty in doing that, because, in the

4

first place, we have a process that really changes a material

8

mathematical calculation.

They didn't have that.

And we're not manufacturing- numbers.

QUESTION:

You see, we're not claiming
We're not

Well, what's new about your process?

10

You told us that it’s an old idea to cure this, so what's the

1 1

-- apparently there's some novelty in the use of the computer

12

or not?
MR. WICKERSHAM:

13
14

Although novelty is not supposed to

be a question --

15

QUESTION:

I understand.

16

MR. WICKERSHAM:

-- on a 101 issue, I'll certainly

17

tell you.

18

a whole, is the combination of constant temperature reading at

19

a place where it will not injure the product, combined with

20
21

22
23
24

25

The novelty in it, which resides in the invention as

constant recalculation.
QUESTION:

Using the computer?

MR. WICKERSHAM:

Using the computer.

Oh, there's no

other way to do that good calculation that I know of.

I mean,

you could get a mathematical genius to do it mentally; it
wouldn't help the novelty of the case any.

Not exactly,

The problem in the sense of knowing that you wanted to get

And so we've been able to increase production perhaps by ten

12

percent at least, I understand, maybe more than that.

13

quite clear, but the idea is, we've gotten much better products

14

and we can produce more of them in the same time from the same

15

machines.

there's something here that would be patentable.

also that if you could do it beforehand you'd have done it
beforehand.
QUESTION:

Well, that's what utility is.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wickersham, if one of your competitors

were to hire the mathematical genius I described, would they
be infringing?
MR. WICKERSHAM:

I don't think they would, the way

25

26

1

our claims are worded, but it would be an interesting case.

2

I think, as you'll notice, our claims as stated, except for

3

Claim 11, the presence or the digital computer, because we

4

thought that was the practical way to do it.

5

didn't know that Flook was going to be decided when we wrote

6

these claims.

7

do in that kind of thing, and the claims, I hope, are some­

8

what artfully drawn from the sense of patent law, because

9

that's supposed to be my profession.

10

Remember, we

We weren't aware of what the Court was going to

But they're not artfully

drawn to get around any particular decision anywhere.
QUESTION:

1 1

No, and you make the assumption that

12

Flook mandates, namely, that the mathematical formula is one

13

to be assumed to be well-known, and here, in fact, it was.
MR. WICKERSHAM:

14

Well, as far as I'm concerned, of

15

course, we couldn't assume anything else here.

16

was old anyway, whether we would assume it or not.
With us, the point was to put these process elements

17
18
19

20

21
22

together.

25

Process elements are somewhat different from machine

elements, but the operation is basically the same.

If we had

the computer and didn't monitor the temperature the way we did
or didn't use it for frequent recalculation, then we wouldn't
have the same, thing.
I believe I should touch a little on the point that

23
24

It definitely

the Solicitor General brought up, that of some prior art and
things.

As I understand it, the Section 101 issue is to be
27

1

decided before one goes into the prior art and there's a sen­

2

tence in the case of Parker v. Flook that says so, as to the

3

art that he is using, the Gates and Davis patents.

4

I should point out that the examiner had considered

5

them and withdrawn his Section 103 objection over them, and

6

that should indicate that at least to one experienced man it

7

was not an obvious thing to do.

8
9

Part of the difference in those resided in the
product, of course.

In both those patents they're talking

10

about making rubber tires, which are rather huge things and

1 1

what we would not call, in our particular field, a precision-

12

molded product.

13

a new one all the flash, the extra material that's there.

14

You can see that although it has a certain definition and such,

15
16
17

18
19

You can see on the rubber tires when you get

it's still relatively a crude product, at least compared to
what we have.
We could not stick a probe through our material
without completely ruining it.

We couldn't even have capaci­

tance measuring devices going across it

starting

from

the

mold without a great deal of difficulty in trying to get a
20

product out of it that would be a satisfactory product.

It

21

would be too rough.

It would have these bumps on it.

22

As far as I'm concerned, both the majority and the
23

minority in the Flook case seem to have agreed that Section 101
24

does not call for considering Section 102 or Section 103.
25

28

1

That is the exact conclusion to which the Court of Customs and

2

Patent Appeals came and why the Court of Customs and Patent

3

Appeals didn't disturb, so-called, the findings, so-called, of

4

the Patent Office Board of Appeals.

5

QUESTION:

Suppose the claims of a patent clearly

6

encompass some unpatentable subject matter and it's completely

7

agreed that that unpatentable subject matter is a discovery in

8

the sense that it's new and novel, but didn't Flook suggest or

9

hold that if that's the only thing new or novel in the claims,

10

that there is no patentable issue?
MR. WICKERSHAM:

that;

MR. WICKERSHAM:
you're right.

I think that basically, of course,

I'm not going to argue with you.

QUESTION:

And in that sense -- well, in that sense,

then, you do inquire into these other elements?
MR. WICKERSHAM:

21
22

I do.
QUESTION:

13

I think it

In that sense and that sense alone,

yes.
QUESTION:

Well, all right, but don't say then that

those elements are wholly foreign under Flook.
MR. WICKERSHAM:

Well, the Section 102 and 103

29

considerations go much deeper than that, I believe.

There are many,

You can enumerate

There's many things that don't come under
Basically, Section 101, I believe, was intended

to protect inventors who came up with something of a physical
embodiment, some way or other; at least a physical embodiment.
Now, numbers are not really physically embodied
even when we write them out, as digits, in the Arabic system.
That's simply a symbol.

The number itself is still a concept.

And I don't think it was ever intended by any of the writers
of the (Constitution or the legislators in Congress, at any time
that people be able to patent their concepts.
But when it gets down to having something that can.be
reduced to a physical status, whether it's a composition of
matter as it was in Chakrabarty, under one interpretation

Do you think the issues in these two cases

are pretty much the same, or different?
MR. WICKERSHAM:
QUESTION:

These two cases?

Yes.

MR. WICKERSHAM:

I would say they're quite different.

I'm not trying to get anything on a machine, they're not trying
to get anything on a process.

They impressed me that the only

thing they really have in common is the use of Section 101 and
the contention by the Commissioner that they both involve
computer programs.
By the way, here's a computer program, some 300 pages,

25

31

which is used in this process.

We didn't disclose it in the

patent application because it wasn't necessary, but that is a

point of patent law because up until a short time ago when

12

the Solicitor made his statement toward the end of his argument,

I believed that they were trying to say that the use of a

computer in any way, or program, made the whole process

HR. WICKERSHAM:

He does; yes.

Now, as far as I'm

concerned, I've never given it much thought whether a computer
program is patentable because computer programs are so long,
so unwieldy, that I just can't see anybody applying for a
patent on it.

That may not be the thoughts of people in the.

software industry but I don't have any clients in that field
myself.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
MR. WALLACE:

We recognize that the process described

in detail in respondents' brief and described during the oral
argument is a useful technological process, as indeed was the
process of updating the alarm limits in Flook for the purpose
of producing certain petrochemicals and other use in the
34

1

hydrocarbon industry, not just to use to get a number, after

2

all.

3

of catalytic conversion.

But it was being applied to the manufacturing processes

4

And, indeed, there is a patent on basically the same

5

process that has been described in so much detail, that is

6

the Gould and Davis patent which was cited by the examiner

7

as the prior art.

8

prior art, the determination was made that what was disclosed

9

here was a computer program and that everything else in the

And in comparing this application with the

10

application was conventional, was known in the prior art, was

1 1

the familiar process.
QUESTION:

patent was a good patent?

can be patentable.
QUESTION:

22
23
24

It lias not been challenged

We think processes of this kind

It probably was a good patent.
Well, whether it was a good patent or not,

it was known.
MR. WALLACE:

20
21

We have no reason to think otherwise.

It was issued by the Patent Office.

18
19

Well, do you think the Gould and Davis

It was known; that's right.

Whether

it was prior art doesn't depend on whether it was a valid
patent.

It was prior art.
Now, the fact of the matter is, regardless of what­

ever factual contentions are made here about whether all of
the novelty inhered in the computer program, we've tried to

25

35

,

1

answer those in our brief.

2

not disturbed by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.

3

fact of the matter is, computer programs can be novel and not

4

obvious.

5

faced with, the question that was before this Court in Benson

That was the finding of the Board,
The

And the question that the Patent Office has been

>

6

and again in Flook, is whether there’s any limitation in the

7

patent law on awarding the patents when you have a computer

8

program or other sequence of mathematical or scientific steps

9

that is novel and not obvious,

and there's an attempt being

10

made to exclude others from using it, perhaps for particular

1 1

end uses.

12

And I want to remind the Court that in the Benson

13

case the Court quoted from the President's Commission on the

14

patent system, which said that the programs themselves were

15

not statutory subject matter,

16

attempts to obtain patents by drafting claims as a process or

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

and, then,

a machine or components thereof,

the

indirect

programmed in a given

manner rather than as a program itself, should not be permitted
And the reasons why that Commission said they should
not be permitted were that reliable searches would not be
feasible or economic because of the tremendous volume of prior
art being generated.

Without this search the patenting of

programs would be tantamount to mere registration, and the
presumption of validity would be all but nonexistent.

And the

creation of programs has undergone substantial and satisfactory
36

1

growth in the absence of patent

2

time copyright protection for programs is available.

3

the legislative question that this Court has twice said it is

4

up to Congress to address, whether in whatever form and effort

5

to get patents on processes or machines where the only element

6

of novelty is in the computer program should be permissible,

7

as long as those programs are not obvious or novel.
QUESTION:

protection and in the mean­
That is

May I ask you a question that's really

unrelated to this legislative problem?

Supposing the Gould

10

patent in this case had never issued but was just applied for,

1 1

and it had whatever claims it has in it now,

12

Arid there was a claim 15 that said that everything in the

13
14

16
17

18
19

20
21

13 or 14 claims.

preceding claims except that all the mathematical calculations
shall be performed by means of a digital computer, would the
entire patent application be patentable subject matter, and
or if

all but the last claim would, would the last claim not

be patentable subject matter because of the reference I in­
cluded in it?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the mere suggestion of the use of

a digital computer would not make the application unpatentable.
Actually they

did suggest the use of a digital computer.

QUESTION:

What's puzzling about this case is, you

22

rely on the earlier patent application to demonstrate that
23

there is no novelty in much of this process, but they argue,
24

they come back and say, yes but that does demonstrate that the
25

37

1

process is patentable subject matter, because a patent issued

2

on it.

3

something in here.

4

patentable subject matter simply because they say you can do a

5

lot of the operations in the process by having the mathematics

6

done by a computer instead of a genius?

And the only thing that's happened is, they've added
Does that destroy what would otherwise be

HR. WALLACE:

7

This is true of a process application

8

or a machine application.

The prior art shows that patents

9

do issue for processes and for machines, and if Flook is to

10

mean anything, it must be more than a guide to the drafting of

1 1

these claims, so that there's always a claim beyond the novel

12

formula itself in the application. It must mean that the applica­

13

tion is analyzed to see whether the only novelty inheres in

14

the scientific principle or formula.

15

in bringing these cases to the Court.
QUESTION:

16
17

18
19

22
23
24

And what you'd say to my hypothetical is

that last claim would then be rejected because the only thing
that was additional in that is the use of the computer, which
would not make it patentable?
MR. WALLACE:

20

21

And that is our point,

It could be rejected just as the one

claim in Morse was rejected, that the Court referred to in
Flook.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:21 o'clock p.m., the case in the

25

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
