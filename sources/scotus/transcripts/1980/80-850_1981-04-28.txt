Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case comes to the Court today on appeal from the
United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.

The ques­

tion presented is whether, under the Equal Protection Clause of
the United States Constitution, a state in furtherance of its
interests in protecting its children and enforcing its criminal
law may enact a statute which provides that a person who commits
the crime of child abandonment and leaves the state Is guilty of
a felony, whereas a person who commits the crime of child aban­
donment without leaving the state is guilty of a misdemeanor.

17

Appellee's challenge -18

QUESTION:

Does it make any difference under this

19

statute whether the particular person left the state three hours
20

after the commission of the act or three years?
21

MS. COSGROVE:

No, sir, there is no time element speci

22

fied on the face of the statute.

Appellee's challenge and the

23

court of appeals decision is predicated on the ground that the
24

statute distinguishes between two classes of abandoning parents,
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

3

1

based upon the exercise of their constitutional right to travel,

2

and that therefore the statute is void under the Equal Protec­

3

tion Clause.

4

Appellee is a father who was ordered by a Georgia

5

court to make child support payments but who never did, who sim

6

ply went to Alabama.

7

for the purpose of avoiding his child support obligations but

8

rather to attend school.

9

his child he was arrested on the warrant for th’e felony of abandonin

10
11
12
13
14

He testified that he did not go to Alabama

When he returned to Georgia to visit

his child and leaving the state, and received a three-year sen­
tence suspended on condition that he make child support pay­
ments, which he never did.

Instead he just left the state

again. He eventually became a resident of Florida.
Upon his wife's death he regained custody of his
child, but he had some problems with the Florida authorities and

15

moved back to Augusta, Georgia, where the child had to be placed
16

in the Department of Family and Children Services custody,
17

basically a welfare agency.

And thereafter, the appellee was

18

arrested on an outstanding bench warrant and sentenced to serve
19

three years.
20
After having exhausted his state remedies, the appel­
21

lee filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States
22

District Court for the Middle District of Georgia alleging that
23

the statute violated his constitutional right to travel and was
24

void under both the Equal Protection and the Privileges and

Immunities Clause of the Constitution.

2

against the appellee but upon appeal to the 5th Circuit the

3

district court's order was reversed and judgment entered for

4

appellee.
QUESTION:

5

The district court ruled

Ms. Cosgrove, I have some difficulty inter­

6

preting the 5th Circuit's opinion, perhaps because of its short­

7

ness.

8

from this Court, which was simply as I had understood it a hand­

9

book of how this Court would interpret federal statutes with

10
11
12
13
14

It seems to rely at some length on the Morissette case

respect to intent and was not a constitutional doctrine at all.
What would you say was the rationale of the 5th Circuit, if
there is one?
MS. COSGROVE:

Your Honor, I believe the 5th Circuit

saw our statute as not having the requisite specific intent
which would make it pass muster.

15

QUESTION:

But why would it have to have requisite --

16

why does it have to have any specific intent?
17

MS.

COSGROVE:

It was the 5th Circuit's opinion that

18

without the specific intent the statute would be overly broad.
19

It's our contention, of course, that it is not necessary to
20
have a specific intent for that element of the crime.
21

QUESTION:

Well, unless you're talking about free

22

speech you don't have an overbreadth challenge here, do you?
23

MS.

COSGRAVE:

That's correct.

I believe only in the

24

First Amendment area has there been a chilling and an overbreadth
25

1

problem addressed by this Court.

2

that inasmuch as the appellee did have a fundamental right to

3

travel, that the statute was the subject of strict scrutiny;

4

and secondly, since Georgia has no compelling state interest

5

involved, that the statute would be violative of equal protec­

6

tion .

7

The court of appeals reasoned

The court of appeals also reasoned that the statute

8

was overly broad in that we had the Uniform Reciprocal Enforce­

9

ment of Support Act, URESA, which was available to vindicate any

10

11
12
13
14
15

of Georgia's interests.
September 19,

Appellant appealed that decision*on

1980, and this Court noted probable jurisdiction

on January 26, 1981.
There are two issues before the Court today.

First,

whether parents who commit the crime of child abandonment do
have a fundamental right to travel in this instance.

And

secondly, if such a right does exist, whether Georgia's child
16

abandonment statute impermissibly penalizes that right without
17

being justified by compelling state interest.
18

Now, turning to the first issue, it is Georgia's posi­
19

tion that the fundamental right to travel, to migrate , to settle in
20

other states, was never intended to encompass and protect the
21

criminal's right to avoid the consequences of his own misdeeds.
22

Whatever the constitutional rights of criminals in other con­
23
texts may be, their rights to full and free travel are attenuated
24
For example, if a person commits a crime, just leaves the
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

jurisdiction, even without intent to avoid prosecution, he is

2

nevertheless subject to mandatory extradition proceedings.

3

in addition,

4

limitations which are tolled the instant a person leaves the

5

state, thus dramatically increasing the time period during which

6

a person may be punished for a crime.

7

lieve that there are any fundamental rights involved in this

8
9
10

11
12
13

And

many states including Georgia have statutes of

So, since we do not be­

case, we submit that it is the rational basis test that should
be applied to this statute and that the statute easily passes
that test.

As this Court has noted, it is the state legislature

which is preeminently responsible for defining,.and punishing
crimes.

And we submit that the state legislature could ration­

ally have decided that a person who commits a crime, in this
instance the crime of child abandonment and leaves thd State

14

makes it much more difficult for the state to bring him to jus­
15

tice, that that person deserves a more stringent punishment.
16

However, even if strict scrutiny test were to be ap­
17

plied, as appellee urges, we submit that the statute would also
18

pass muster under this more exacting standard, for it is not
19

every constitutional infringement, of course, that is barred,
20

it's only those which rise to the level of penalty.

It's our

21

position, of course, that this statute in no way penalizes the
22

right to migrate.

Indeed, if it has any effect at all upon the

23

right to migrate and settle in other states, that effect is
24

purely incidental and remote.

For under the statute a parent is

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

7

1

free to move to any state he wishes, stay as long as he wishes,

2

and the statute has absolutely no impact upon him at all unless

3

he has committed the crime of child abandonment.

4

So this statute is unlike provisions which this Court

5

has struck down in, for example, Crandall v. Nevada, a taxing

6

provision that reached everyone who left the state.

7

ute is narrowly tailored to reach only those persons who have

8

committed a crime.

There is --

This applies whether you abandon after

you've left the state or before?

really would have no standing to raise that second prong -16

this case, he pled guilty.

QUESTION:

I understand.

MS. COSGROVE:

Secondly,

I

might

mention

that,

21

unlike some of the cases, for example Maricopa County and
22

Shapiro, where this Court was concerned with provisions which
23

addressed themselves primarily to indigents, that this statute
24

does not impact on those persons who are in the blameless but

2

on the most blameworthy persons, those parents who abandon their

helpless children.

4

parents who simply wish to go to another state than does the

5

existence of an extradition law or an indefinite statute of

6

limitations.

7

Rather, this statute impacts

So we feel that this statute no more penalize?

QUESTION:

Of course, this whole problem could be

8

solved, I suppose, if the Georgia Legislature simply made child

9

abandonment a felony.

10

11
12
13
14

MS. COSGROVE:

Well, Your Honor, of course the Georgia

Legislature certainly could have done that and many states have,
but I think that in not doing so they have recognized the
difference in the type of crime, in that the impact upon the
child is greater because the likelihood of ever recovering any
support is much less when the parent --

15

QUESTION:

This is not a support statute; this is a

16

criminal statute.
17

MS. COSGROVE:

Well, sir, there are two elements in

18

child abandonment.

First, one has to desert the child.

19

QUESTION:

Yes, but this is a criminal statute.

There

20

is nothing in this statute that requires the parent to support.
21

It only punishes the parent for not supporting.
22

MS. COSGROVE:

For not supporting.

That's correct,

23

Your Honor.

Of course, even if the Court were to see this as

24

somewhat of a penalty upon the constitutional right to travel,
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

9

1

it's Georgia's position that the statute is more than justified

2

by our compelling interest in protecting our children and en­

3

forcing our criminal laws.

4

children appellee, does not

5

in at least two other statutes which make this

6

10

11

even

dispute, and it is manifested
same felony-

misdemeanor distinction.
For example, we have a statute which makes it a felony

7
8

And this interest in protecting our

for a husband to abandon his pregnant wife and leave the state,
whereas if he stays in the state, it is a misdemeanor.

And

similarly, we have a statute which makes it a felony if one is
to interfere with the custody of a child who is committed to
the legal custody of another, and then to take that child out

12

of the state.

And again, interference with the custody of a

child

the

13

within

state is only a misdemeanor.

14

So, I think the Court can see that Georgia is fairly
15

consistent in this design to protect its children.
16

Turning to the interest in protecting our criminal
17

laws, practically speaking, when a criminal leaves the jurisdic­
18

tion, Georgia, just like every other state, is dependent upon
19

extradition to get that person back to face trial or to serve
20

his punishment.
21

QUESTION:

Do you have a general statute that makes it

22

a crime to flee from justice, or to abscond, or to leave the
23

state?
24

What if you're under indictment and you leave the state?

Is that a separate crime?

QUESTION:

MS. COSGROVE:

QUESTION:

It could be a breach of a bail condition,

I suppose.

8

MS. COSGROVE:

9

QUESTION:

10

13
14
15

Yes, sir, I think it could be.

How about -- is that a crime in your state,

to violate your bail?
MS. COSGROVE:

11
12

There are many statutes, including

federal statutes that --

6
7

But isn't that -- that's not unheard of,

though, around the country, is it?

4
5

Not.to my understanding, Your Honor.

I'm not at all sure, Your Honor.

The

felony provision of Georgia's child abandonment statute greatly
enhances extradition for -- although I'm sure this Court is
aware that, technically speaking, it is possible to extradite
for misdemeanors under both state and federal law, as a practi­
cal matter, the discretion to refuse to extradite for misdemea­

16

nors is totally within the governor of the responding state.
17

QUESTION:

Of course, if Georgia made this a felony

18

across the board, all these problems would disappear, wouldn't
19

they?
20

MS. COSGROVE:

Perhaps our problems with extradition

21

would disappear, Your Honor.

But again, I would say that the

22

Georgia -23

QUESTION:

As would this case disappear.

24

MS. COSGROVE:

Yes, sir.

The appellee would not

North American Reporting

11

1

contend that there was anything wrong with a felony across the

2

board.

3

need not make that across-the-board distinction.

It's simply our position that the Georgia Legislature

As I was saying, the discretion to refuse to extra­

4
5

dite for misdemeanors is totally within the purview of the

6

governor of the responding state.

7

has said that Georgia really does not even need to use extradi­

But the court of appeals

tion to satisfy our interest in this case, that we have the
provisions of URESA, the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of
Support Act, which can vindicate any of our interests, mainly
that we can obtain support for the child, or return the parent
to the state.

12

We submit that the court of appeals was in error in
13
this regard for several reasons.

I need to explain that all

14
50 states have in fact adopted some sort of reciprocal enforce­
15
ment act.
16
QUESTION:

May I ask, Ms. Cosgrove, if we agree with

17
the argument to this point with 'you, we dohAt -have to reach
18
this question, do we?
19
MS. COSGROVE:

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?

20
QUESTION:

If we agree with what you have said up to

21

date, supporting the constitutionality of the statute as not
22

violative of the

right

to

travel,

then we don't have to

23
reach this alternative?
24
MS. COSGROVE:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

12

This is a

1

less drastic means, argument which the court of appeals --

2

QUESTION:

But you don't have to rely on it if we

3

agree with your initial argument.

4

MS. COSGROVE:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

That's correct, Your Honor.

Because then you're just -- need a rational

basis.
MS. COSGROVE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But the

8

court of appeals used as an example of the overbreadth that we

9

did have this alternative means available to us, and I think,

10

11
12
13
14

quite honestly, that this alternative means simply is not effec­
tive for under the version of URESA which has been adopted by
approximately 10 states, there is a provision by which an
absent parent can totally avoid extradition.

He simply submits

himself to the jurisdiction of the court of the responding
state and agrees to pay some child support.

And he never comes

15

back to Georgia, he never sees the inside of a jail.
16

For the remaining states which do not have that auto­
17

matic avoidance of extradition, many of them nevertheless have a
18

discretionary section which says to the governor of the respond­
19

ing state, basically, if there has not been a URESA petition filed,
20

you don't have to extradite this person.

You can require a

21

URESA petition to be filed first.

And secondly, if there is an

22

outstanding order of some type in existence and the absent
23

parent is complying with that order, then the governor can also
24

just refuse to extradite that person.
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

13

1

I think if we were to follow the court of appeals deci­

2

sion in this case, we could conceivably have a situation where

3

a person abandons his child in Georgia, goes to another juris­

4

diction, and even if the custodial parent -- and I might add, it

5

is usually the custodial parent which files a URESA petition --

6

even if that custodial parent were successful in getting that

7

absent parent into the court of the responding state, it is more

8

likely than not that he could totally avoid extradition by sim­

9

ply agreeing to pay child support.

10

11
12
13
14
15
16
17

And the difficulty with that -- you know, one might
say, well, he's paying child support, that ought to settle the
problem -- the difficulty is that the duty of support which
URESA contemplates is not the duty of support which obtains in
the demanding state, in Georgia, for example.

It would be the

duty of support imposable under the laws where the absent parent
was, and that's presumed to be the responding state.

So we can

have a situation where the absent parent comes into court, he
agrees to pay child support, he may well be a respected member

18

of the community by now, and the court simply will not impose
19

a large amount of support on that absent parent, and thus really
20

defeating the order of the Georgia court, and also not meeting
21

the needs of the child.
22

QUESTION:

Well, again, this is a criminal statute

23

we're dealing with here.

And the law that you're discussing

24

and that was discussed by the court of appeals is not a criminal

statute, is it?

3

It's

a

statute to enforce 'the

duty

of

by making the parents supporters of the child?
MS. COSGROVE:

Yes, Your Honor, and it was the court

4

of appeals opinion that we could simply use this civil statute

5

as a substitute for our criminal statute.

6

of course, that the state has a right to define and punish

7

anti-social conduct such as child abandonment and that we have

8

a right, if the need be, to put this person in jail or at least

9

to make him think that he is going to.

10
11
12

13
14

QUESTION:

It is our position,

Are you interested in support for the child

or putting him in jail?
MS. COSGROVE:

Well, sir, they're dual interests.

course we want support for the child.

Of

I think the problem with

the URESA petition is -QUESTION:

I thought that was the whole purpose.

15

MS. COSGROVE:

Well, it's the whole purpose if the

16

person complies with court orders.

But as Your Honor is probab­

17

ly aware, a person can say, of course I'm going to comply.
18

QUESTION:

Well, I understand you that if somebody

19

goes to another state and sends the money back, would you still
20

bring him back?
21

MS. COSGROVE:

I beg your pardon?

22

QUESTION:

If a man is giving $25 a month support and

23

he goes to Alabama and he sends back $25 a month, you still
24

would make him come back and go to jail?

Well, there are two prongs, Your Honor.

Yes, that's what I thought.

MS. COSGROVE:

10
11

No, he would not be guilty of child

abandonment because he --

6

Not in that particular instance.

You have to abandon your child, desert

your parental duties, and then leave the child in a dependent
condition.

So if he were complying with a court order regard­

less of how -QUESTION:

He violated a support order and he went

then goes on.

QUESTION:

MS. COSGROVE:

You don't ever catch them.
It's very difficult, Your Honor, it

really is, and I think that is one of the crucial reasons that

Georgia needs this felony provision of the child abandonment

statute, simply In order to be able to get this type of person

back if need be.

8

antisocial conduct such as child abandonment would be defeated

because our right to enforce our laws is simply meaningless

without an effective method of bringing the criminal back to
trial.
QUESTION:

14

I think if we were to follow the court of

Now, Ms. Cosgrove, this statute says that

the felony shall be reducible to a misdemeanor.

How, under

Georgia practice, is it reduced?
MS. COSGROVE:

Your Honor, this can either be by the

15

recommendation of the jury and then has to be approved by the
16

judge, or the judge on his own motion can reduce the felony.

QUESTION:

The prosecutor can't do it?

QUESTION: ' Prosecutor can''t do It?

MS. COSGROVE:

Not to my understanding.

to everything but capital felonies.

We submit that the court of ap­

BONNER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I want to get one thing straight, I guess, at the out­

17

set, and that is that we don't necessarily contest the opening
18

principle, I think, that the state started its argument with,
19

that is that there is nothing in the right to travel which pro­
20

tects a parent or an accused from the consequences of his middeeds.
21

That's not our argument at all, and that's a mischaracterization
22
of it.

■ ’

23

I will concede at the outset that there is probably,
24

in fact there is certainly a valid area here, a general area

3

reach parents who use their right to travel across a state line

4

to frustrate the state's interest, to compound an offense.

5

this isn't that kind of statute, and the existence of a valid

6

area for operation of that kind of statute don't save this one.

7

We need to look at the -- if this were that kind of statute,

8

then what she said about there being a reasonable connection

and this being subject to the rational connection test would

probably be valid.

QUESTION:

By all means.

20

MR. BONNER:

Revive it.

As I say, our question here

21

is how this statute affects the right of travel.

And if you

22

look at it, any travel triggers the statute.

The reason -- as

23

the state has conceded, the reason for the travel is totally in­
24

significant. The time of the travel is totally insignificant.

here what you've got is the exercise of a constitutionally

QUESTION:

This is true of a person under indictment

21

who flees the state.

He carries the presumption of innocence

22

right with him across the state border.

MR. BONNER:

24

able, but what you've got -25

QUESTION:

Why are they more reasonable or less rea­

2

sonable than with the misdemeanor that Justice Stevens postu­

3

lated to you?

4

MR. BONNER:

Well, because that's a reasonable intru­

5

sion onto the right to travel, vis-a-vis the state's interest

6

in having him there and prosecuting him.

analogy there.

Georgia had isolated, say, the right to trial by jury and made

I don't1really see any

But this, again, is the same situation as if

special penalty of death, as in Jackson v.

United States; or attaching a poll tax to voting in a federal
election, as in Harman v. Forssenius.

This is what Georgia has

done, and the reason that this case falls in the shadow of those
authorities is again basically because of the wanton use Georgia
makes of interstate travel as an element of this offense.
Wanton, because it has no nexus, has no intent, is not confined

15

by any kind of purpose, nee'd not have any relationship at all under
16

that statute to the state's interest.
17

QUESTION:

Do you question at all the authority of the

18

state to criminalize the failure to support a child?
19

MR. BONNER:

No, sir, none at all.

20
QUESTION:

Even though it's

criminalizing

not

21

paying a debt, in a sense?

In order to --

22

MR. BONNER:

Well, I have no qualms about that.

I'm here because my client's been branded a felon and not a

misdemeanant.

QUESTION:

Yes, I know, but no part of your case ques­

tions at all the authority of the state to criminalize?

3

MR. BONNER:

No, sir, I think there are a lot of

4

policy reasons why not, and I think that's why you've got URESA,

5

because of the judgments that the state made that this kind of

6

problem is better approached civilly.

MR. BONNER:

QUESTION:

Oh, I see, you agree to that?

They could

have done that?
MR. BONNER:

13
14

Yes, but that's just entirely discre­

tionary .

11
12

You agree that the jury could have made it

Yes, sir, they could have done it.

But

it would be a judgment that would be made without any guidance,
without any --

15

QUESTION:

But they could have done that in your

16

case?
17

MR. BONNER:

Yes, sir.

They certainly could.

18

Let me jump ahead to the strict scrutiny analysis
19

which I hope we reach somewhere.

But if you figure that we've

20

got a constitutionally protected right to travel here, then
21

under the familiar formulas of this Court, it would fall under
22

strict scrutiny, and I don't mean to repeat it for your edifi­
23

cation, but for mine, that would mean that the state would have
24

to show that it's reasonably necessary to promote a compelling

down to extradition.

say about the welfare of the child and about the enforcement of

the criminal law, on both avenues it boils down to aiding'

extradition.

The state basically, their interest here comes
When you look behind everything they can

But the only -- the thing is that that's not neces­
sarily compelling interest because we've got the Extradition
Clause of the Constitution, we've got the Federal Extradition
Act, we've got URESA, we've got uniform reciprocal -- whatever
it is -- uniform criminal extradition act.
they completely serve that interest.

All of these serve,

As a matter of fact, under

the last two, Bobby Helms need not ever have even been in
Georgia, much less have been a fugitive from Georgia.

Under all

13

law, the caliber of the crime, the fact that it's a misdemeanor,
14

not a felony, doesn't prevent extradition.

He's extraditable

15

under all of them.

Elevating it to a felony doesn't apparently

16

aid the state's interest one bit except for the argument they
17

make that governors will treat this offense more seriously and
18

everything if it's a felony, which is a pretty good argument if
19

you want to make the whole crime a felony, but it's not a pretty
20

good argument for the distinction.
21

The state fails on the necessity aspect of that strict
22

scrutiny test.

Looking at it simply under URESA and everything

23

else, it's just not necessary, and it can't promote it.

Even

24

if it were a felony and the state proceeded under URESA, they
25

would still encounter those relief provisions that the state

2

talked about.

3

another state, by entertaining an action brought by the father

4

over there, could completely bar extradition under URESA,

5

regardless of whether it's a felony or misdemeanor.

A judge in Alabama could still -- or, a judge in

But in any event URESA is designed to be a supplemen­

6
7

tary kind of extradition procedure, not one that necessarily

8

preempts.

9

the state's perfectly free to proceed under all its other extra­

10

11
12
13

I forget exactly what section of URESA it is, but

dition powers.

And again, under all of those extradition powers

whether the thing's a felony or a misdemeanor, they still run
into the governor's discretion'.'

And making it a capital felony

is not necessarily going to elude that governor's discretion.
QUESTION:

14

Well, what about the initial interest of

the state in keeping the fellow within reach so that they can
15

collect child support?

Why isn't that a compelling interest in

16

itself?
17

MR. BONNER:

Well, because in effect it attaches a

18

special penalty to any parent's right to travel -19

QUESTION:

Well, the right to travel --

MR. BONNER:

-- whether he's going to come back, whe­

21

ther he's not going to come back.
22

QUESTION:

All right, accepting for the moment the fact

23

that it burdens the right t9 travel, then there must be a com­
24

pelling interest to justify it, and what's wrohg' with keeping him

around so that support may be collected?

2
3

MR. BONNER:

would be wrong with that.

4
5

Oh, maybe I should back up.

QUESTION:

Nothing

That would be --

Well, I know.

Why isn't that a compelling

interest?
MR. BONNER:

6

Well, that might be how the Chief Jus­

7

tice's question a minute ago makes sense about one under indict­

8

ment can't leave the state.

9

not making sense that it comes from here, not from there.

10

11
12

15

I'm sure If anyone's

No, I mean, that's how his example is explicable, because, you
know, that kind of restriction would completely and carefully
serve that particular interest.
QUESTION:

13
14

I'm sorry.

Although

Georgia, surely Georgia could not

make it a criminal offense for any

Georgia parent to leave the

state?
MR. BONNER:

No, it couldn't.

And as a matter of

16

fact, it couldn't -- you can carry it somewhat further, and
17

say, any parent who wants to leave the state's got to stop at
18

the state border and post bond for the support of his children.
19

QUESTION:

On the other hand —

20

MR. BONNER:

And then you'll have Alabama on the

21

other side saying, if he brings his children in, he's got to
22

post bond to make sure they don't become public charges.
23

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting the state couldn't adopt

a felony statute that they couldn't leave the state if they left

MR.

BONNER:

BONNER:

BONNER:

That's exactly why the statute is wrong.
Yes,

but you say they1 can't --

Is bad.
That's your reason for saying it's bad?
Yes, sir.

That Georgia couldn't do that.

10

This is a different degree of intrusion, but it's exactly the

11

same kind of pattern of intrusion.

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

Here, essentially, Georgia

has taken a constitutionally secured right, the right to travel,
and they've made the degree of an offense turn upon it.

They've

made the difference between a felony and a misdemeanor turn upon
it, and they've made it turn upon it.

Bobby Helms couldrt't come into

court and say.my sick grandmother was over there and I had to visit her.
QUESTION:

Mr.

Bonner, do I understand your argument

really doesn't rest on the fact that it's an abandonment case?
Say it was a case involving it's a misdemeanor to shoot wildlife,

19
shoot a bird or a deer or something like that, but if one does

20
that and thereafter leaves the state it's a felony.

You'd make

21
the same argument with that kind of statute?
22
MR.

BONNER:

Yes, sir.

23
QUESTION:

Same thing?

Yes.

24
MR.

BONNER:

Exactly.
