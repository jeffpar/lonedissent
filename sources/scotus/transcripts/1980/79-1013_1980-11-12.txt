ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS BENDER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MR. BENDER:

9

this Honorable Court:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The question before this Court is a single point,

11

referred to in Point 1 of petitioner's brief, and that is

12

whether the pledge of securities as collateral for a loan is

13

a sale or a purchase for the purpose of invoking the anti­

14

fraud provisions of the Securities Acts.

15

that the pledge is not a sale or purchase under either the

16

1933 definition of the anti-fraud provisions of the Act, or

17

under Section 10)b) and Rule 10b-5 of the 1934 Act.

18

It is our contention

The pledge occurred in this case as the result of

19

a series of loans totaling approximately $475,000, by Tri-State

20

Energy, a corporation, by whom petitioner was employed from

21

October 19th, 1972, through December 6th, 1972.

22

say, the loans were obtained over that period, October 19th,

23

1972, through December the 6th, 1972.

24
25

That is to

The loans were evidenced by promissory notes that
were executed by the borrower corporation and were individually

guaranteed by some of the officers, including the petitioner
who was not a stockholder of the corporation.
was given for the loan.

Side collateral

And at page 8 of petitioner's brief,

the principal witness for the government, an employee of
the bank, describes his definition of side collateral to be:
that when the loan was made initially the loan was envisioned
that it would be repaid from the ongoing operations of the
corporation, namely from the sale of coal or natural gas, the
collateral was taken as a secondary source of repayment in the

10

event that the primary source, the ongoing operations of the

11

corporation didn't materialize.

12

Also given by the borrowers at the time were blank

13

stock powers, corporate resolutions authorizing the pledging

14

and hypothecation of securities of the stock as security for

15

the loan.

16

disputed here that the bank sued the petitioner in the state

17

court, in New York, on the promissory note based upon his

18

individual guaranty.

19

in the joint appendix at 174(a), which is an affidavit of

20

confession of judgment.

21

The loan was defaulted, and I don't think it's

The evidence of the lawsuit is set forth

It is undisputed that there was no foreclosure of

22

the securities by the bank, so that actually this Court does

23

not really have to reach any interest in what may have occurred,

24

or interest in the securities as to what may occur if there

25

was a foreclosure.

To that extent, the Fifth and the Seventh

goes that far, we submit, is unnecessary for this Court's
decision any more than the Second Circuit Court's decision
in Mallis, Bankers Trust Company against Mallis, which con­
siders the release of the security by the bank or the pledgee
as being a sale within the anti-fraud provisions, is likewise
unnecessary to reach the decision in this case.
The charge is set forth, that is, the indictment
in this case, is set forth in page 3 of petitioner's brief.
This was a conspiracy plus two substantive counts, Counts I,
II, and III. The conspiracy encompassed a charge of violating
three objects:

the only one that we're concerned with is the

one which charged a violation of Section 17(a)(1) in the
offer and sale of a security, pursuant to a scheme to defraud.
And that was under Section 77X of the 1933 Securities Act.
I should add that petitioner was acquitted of the
substantive charge in Count III, which was a violation of
Section 17(a)(1) of the 1933 Act.

He was convicted of the

conspiracy which encompassed the three objects.

With respect

20

to the second count which was a substantive count, also one

21

of the objects of the conspiracy, to defraud the bank of the

22

half million dollars in violation of Section

23

18, the jury had -- and incidentally, which subsumed all of

24

the alleged fraud in the pledging of the securities in Count

25

I, and that appears at page 28 of our brief footnote in the

But the prosecutor, after the jury had convicted

Petitioner does not mount any challenge to the
fraud alleged in this case,and of course, that's prominently
brought out by my learned brother; but the fact is that since
the issue, we feel, is one of law, we assume the fraud for
that purpose.
the fraud.

It does not necessarily mean that we concede

Petitioner contends that no matter how the fraud

alleged in the pledge of the collateral, the pledge trans­

11

action did not constitute a sale under Section 17(a)(1) of

12

the 1933 Act or Section 10b or Rule 10b-5 of the 1934 Act,

13

and that therefore, the conviction must be reversed.

14

Now we take this position because in accordance with

15

the decisions in the Fifth Circuit and in the Seventh Circuit,

16

with which we agree, we believe that if we were to, as the

17

government argues, or my learned brother argues , extend the

18

anti-fraud provisions of the 1933 Act to a pledge, an ordinary,

19

garden variety pledge of stock as collateral for a loan to

20

the terms sale in the 1933 Act or purchase in the 1934 Act,

21

it would add a gloss to the operative language of the statute

22

which, we submit, was not intended by Congress in view of the

23

commonly accepted meaning of those words, sale and purchase.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well Mr. Bender, do you concede, however,

that the literal language of the definition of sale in the
6

1

'33 Act is broad enough to embrace a pledge transaction?
2

MR. BENDER:
3
4
5

7

do not.

I do say, however, that the Courts of Appeal in the

Fifth and the Seventh Circuits do say that the language is
broad enough in the sense that it includes a disposition of
an interest in the security as being broad enough to include
a pledge.

10

11

And the reason why I don't, frankly, think so, is
because I think that what a pledger does in -- and what he
did in this case -- is simply to buy credit.

He doesn't sell

And then the motion -QUESTION:

What does the word disposition include

other than sale, if you're right?

14
15

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I personally

MR. BENDER:

The word disposition, under the Web­

ster's Dictionary, is such a broad thing, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

It even includes a donation, a giving.

And the point

I'm trying to make is that you could say that the realities
of the transaction is that a pledger says to a bank, I'm
going to borrow half a million dollars from you and I'm going

20

to put up security, I'm going to give you an agreement.

21

that agreement is that in the event I default on this loan,

22

you have an interest in my collateral.

23

I'm saying is that the most a pledger does is give an agree­

24

ment that if there's a default the bank will acquire an

25

interest.

But there is not an effective

And

So that actually what

disposition of an interest at the time the collateral agree­
ment is entered into.

In any event, even if we were to

assume as my learned brother stresses that the literal defini­
tion of the statute clearly embraces a pledge, it must be
apparent that if Congress intended to include a pledge in the
definition, it would have said so.

later, in 1935; that is two years later, in the Public Utility
Holding Act, which I will come to -QUESTION: Which is the -- the Solicitor General
seems to rest, pivot his case more on the word sale than on

the word dispose.

12

willingness to do that.

13

It did so, but a year

I'll confess I'm a little puzzled by his

MR. BENDER:

My learned brother also finds in the

14

legislative history, a very distinct Congressional intention

15

to include a pledge in the definition.

16

the Courts below, that are contrary to the Court of Appeals

17

of the Second Circuit and the Seventh, find no such clear

18

legislative history.

19

lative history as set forth

20

I must confess that

I must confess further that the legis­
is rather suspect.

And the reason why I say that is because on November

21

10th, 1977, right before this Court, in the Bankers

22

Company against Mallis argument, that's number 76-1359, at

23

page 45 of the transcript, I believe it was Mr. Justice

24

Powell who asked the question, "Is there anything in the

25

legislative history of either Act of 1933 or 1934 that supports

your position that a pledge is a sale?"

been identified as general counsel of the SEC, "If there is
anything or something specific on pledges, I must confess I
am not aware of that."

QUESTION:

11

Secondly

Mr. Bender, that doesn't estopp the

Solicitor General from doing further research, does it?

7

8

Mr. Pitt, who has

MR. BENDER:

No, it -- it does not, Mr. Justice

Stevens, and if that was the only area in which there might
have been a difference, I would be hard put to say the legis­
lative history is suspect.

But I have an even more signif­

icant fact, and that is that the SEC conceded before this

12

very Court on the same argument, that it had never taken a

13

position that the Securities Act of 1933 or 1934 embraced in

14

its definition a Congressional Intent to include pledges.

15

QUESTION:

Of course, as a practical matter, I

16

suppose this issue will only come up in criminal cases? Because

17

in a civil case, if you've got a loan secured by stock you've

18

got your liability established by the note.

19

no reason to fuss about it in a civil case, is there?

20

MR. BENDER:

So there's really

Well, except that the, In the govern­

21

ment's position -- I mean, since these cases all come up, for

22

example, Gentile, in the Court of Appeals, was on a criminal

23

case.

But all the other cases are civil cases.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. BENDER: There are civil cases under 17(a)(1),

Are they?

9

1

and civil cases where, under 10(b)(5).

2

-- I believe, so that actually,

3

although the government, or my learned brother, would like to

4

separate this issue by saying that this is a criminal case it

5

should not and will not affect what may happen as far as

6

civil actions are concerned.

7

And for example, the

to answer your question,

The fact remains that the Securities Exchange

8

Commission's general counsel and so did the Court of Appeals

9

in the Second Circuit indicate that the same rule that would

10

apply in the criminal case, at least with respect to whether

11

a pledge of collateral for a loan is a sale, would apply in

12

any civil action.

13

position.

14

And the courts seem generally to take that

And of course, the general counsel of the SEC told

15

this Court the last time that you also can't separate the 1933

16

Act definitions from the 1934, even though there's a slight

17

difference in the wording.

18

materia,

19

the definition of a sale under the 1933 Act applies under the

20

1934 Act.

Because the statutes are entire

they said, so that what you hold with regard to

When Congress wanted to say that a pledge was a sale,

21

22

it had no trouble saying so; and it did so in the Public Util­

23

ity Holding Act.
QUESTION:

But that was a different Congress wasn't

it?

MR. BENDER:
Rehnquist?

It is — I beg your pardon, Mr. Justice

QUESTION:

It was a different Congress, so one was

1933 and one was 1935.

5

MR. BENDER:

Yes, you're absolutely right.

It was

6

a year after the 1934 Act.

7

the government argues, the 1933 Congress that passed the

8

Securities Act of 1933 had before it a

9

of the Uniform Sales of Securities Act, and presumably adopted

But the point is, that if, as

1929 definition

10

that definition which included a pledge, it seems highly un­

1 1

likely that Congress, passing the Public Utility Holding Act

12

in which the Securities and Exchange Commission was the

13

administrative agency enforcing that act and certainly didn't

14

have before it the 1933 and 1934 definitions of sale, and yet

15

it went out of its way to include a pledge as a sale -QUESTION:

16

Well now, in the '33 Act definition, where

17

it's defining sale, it says, "it shall include every contract

18

of sale".

19

delivery, right there, when you're talking about a contract of

20

sale, would include an agreement to transfer possession in 60

21

days or disposition -- now that, wouldn't that include any

22

agreement to transfer by pledge, if disposition is such a

23
24

25

So I suppose that goes further than an actual physic al

broad gauge term, as you have suggested?
MR. BENDER:

Well, as I said before, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, the Sixth and the Seventh Circuits seem to agree

11

1

that it's broad enough.

2

enough to include a pledge.

3

is that the economic underlying realities of a pledge indicate

4

that it's so far from what a sale or a purchase really was

5

intended by Congress, that the literal

6

not be followed in the sense of reality.

7

That the language itself is broad
What I -- what they say, however,

interpretation should

And the reason for that is set forth in the totally

8

different kind of rights that exist as between a pledge and as

9

between an actual sale.

And the fact remains that for 25

10

years, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the administra­

11

tive agency who sat with the Congress at the time that this

12

act was enacted, never took a public position that a pledge

13

was included.

14

conceded that they did; and it's interesting, because Professor

15

Loss

16

ion in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on which

17

the Second Circuit's Gentile decision relies came down did

18

the Securities and Exchange Commission adopt the decision to

19

its corporate bosom and take the position that a pledge was

20

included as a sale.

21

It was only until the late 1950's that they

points out that it was only when the Guild Films decis­

Now my learned brother makes no mention in his brief

22

as to why, if the legislative history intended to include a

23

pledge even though it didn't say so, why the Securities and

24

Exchange Commission never took that position publicly.

25

this Court had occasion to remark about the divergent views of
12

And

1

the Securities and Exchange Commission in the International

2

Brotherhood case, dealing with the includability of the non­

3

contributory pension.

4

for the Court, said "when the instant litigation arose, the

5

public record reveals no evidence that the SEC had ever con­

6

sidered the Securities Acts applicable to a non-contributory

7

pension".

8

pledges were included in the Act.

9

I believe Mr. Justice Powell, speaking

Similarly here, the SEC never took the position that

And as I say, the Public Utility Holding Act, in

10

1935, clearly includes pledge in its

11

Now my learned brother says that we shouldn't look to what

12

Congress did in 1935 to determine what it did or intended to

13

do in 1933.

14

just that very thing, even where a greater span existed between

15

the 1933 and 1934 Acts in the International Brotherhood case

16

against Daniel.

17

definition of a sale.

This Court, we submit, had no trouble in doing

Now my learned brother says that Congress intended

18

to protect banks, corporate businesses, lenders -- even if the

19

bank was not an investor in this particular instance and of

20

course the bank, really, if you look at the underlying trans­

21

actions, was not an investor.

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

But if it foreclosed on a default it would

be an investor, wouldn't it?
MR. BENDER:

It might very well, Mr. Chief Justice.

But as I say, that is an issue that I don't think the Court
13

1

has to reach.

2

QUESTION:

But when the transaction was initiated,

3

it had to contemplate the risks, the investor-type risks; does

4

not every bank do that with respect to collateral?

5

MR. BENDER:

It certainly does.

And I think that

6

they would be foolish not to.

But that doesn't necessarily

7

mean that when they entered into the transaction and they

8

simply got a contract right to acquire an interest, that that

9

-- any fraud involved in that kind of a pledge would constitute

10

a sale.

The issue we have here is there was no foreclosure.

11

And what we're dealing with is an ordinary garden variety

12

pledge at the moment of the pledge, not what might happen when

13

there's a foreclosure.
QUESTION:

14

The bank was induced to part with some

15

of its funds, conditionally of course, but

to part with some

16

of its funds in reliance upon what was tendered to them, is

17

that not so?

18

MR. BENDER:

That, I believe, is -- would be normally

19

so in the ordinary pledge case.

20

normally so.

21

part of the loan at least as far as the record is concerned,

22

prior to the fact that any security was put up -- although,

23

there was an agreement that collateral security would be

24

supplied.

25

require an interest in the securities; the primary purpose

I would say that it would be

As a matter of fact, here, the loan, the first

But the primary purpose was not for the bank to

was for the bank to make a loan and get paid.

And this was

the intention of the bank, this was the intention as far as
the pledge agreement

is concerned.

And it seems to me, we submit, that in determining
whether you have a sale or a disposition of an interest, and
Congress intended a pledge to be covered, you've got to look
at what the realities of the situation was.

Now we raised,

Petitioner raised the fact that the bank was not interested
at the time of the pledge in obtaining any profits on the
securities, the bank was not interested in making anything more
on its loan than interest, which it was to get.

And the

government -QUESTION:

Well it was interested in getting its

capital back.
MR. BENDER:

Well of course, I mean plus its capital.

But it was not interested in trading on the securities, Mr.
Chief Justice.

a security at the time that it was entering into the loan

MR. BENDER:

Blackmun, if the government relies substantially upon that, I
think this case is totally inapposite.

In that case, you had

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

That is correct; that is quite correct,

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

The government contends that Section 17(a) of the

Securities Act of 193.3 prohibits fraudulent pledges of secur­

of the statute, the ordinary meaning of those terms in 1933

If Congress had meant to exclude this well-recognizec

7

legal interest of a pledgee from the definition of offer and

8

sale, it surely would not have used the language that it did

9

in the Securities Act.

It would be a remarkable example of

10

legislative inattention if Congress wrote this statute to ex­

11

tend to every disposition of an interest in a security.

12

it really had meant to say every disposition of an interest

13

except for a pledge.

14

interest, which Congress used without qualification, is the

15

legally enforceable right to have an advantage accruing from

16

some thing, or any right in the nature of property but less

17

than title. It was settled law in 1933 that a pledgee obtained

18

just such a legal right.Decisions of this Court and the learned

19

treatises of the time, confirmed that a pledgee received a

20

special property interest in pledged securities and that it

21

gave value for that special property interest when it extended

22

credit.

23

commercial law that a pledgee that received negotiable secur­

24

The dictionary meaning of the word

Indeed, by 1933, it was a black letter principle of

2

rights.
3

In short, looking to the ordinary meaning of the
4

terms used by Gongrebs when the Securities Act was enacted,
5

it's clear that the Petitioner's pledge of securities was a
6

disposition of an interest in those securities for value.

I

7

might add in this connection that although Mr. Bender has
8

addressed the question

in this case with great competence,

9

I have yet to hear him explain to the Court what it was that
10

the bank got, if it wasn't a legal interest in these pledged
11

securities.
12

Petitioner of course also argues that the Court

should not apply the statute literally, as Congress has writter.

13

it, because the legislative history doesn't refer to pledge
14
15
16
17
18
19
20

21
22
23
24
25

transactions.

That omission however, is not sufficing, because

the legislative history doesn't describe any of the interests
that Congress meant to embrace within its definition of offer
and sale.

Congress took care of the problem of specifying

which transactions it meant to cover, by drafting the statute
to apply to every disposition of an interest in a security.
And even more fundamentally, omissions from the
legislative history can't nullify the plain meaning of the
statute as this Court pointed out, last term, In Harrison
v. P.P.G. Industries, where the Court stated and I quote,
"it would be a strange cannon of statutory construction that
would require Congress to state in
22

committee reports or

1

elsewhere, that which is obvious on the face of the statute."

2

I don't mean to suggest from these remarks that the legislative

3

history doesn't shed light on the issue in this case.

4

shed substantial light and confirms the appropriateness of the

5

literal statutory construction.

6

In the first place --

QUESTION:

Well if we have a literal statutory

construction available, why do we look at legislative history?

9

MR. SHAPIRO:

It's completely unnecessary, Your

10

Honor, If -- unless the legislative history were to completely

11

conflict with the plain meaning, the legislative history is

12

merely icing on the cake.

13

because the literal terms of this statute do prohibit fraud in

14

the pledge of securities.

15

there is no disharmony in the legislative history in the

16

plain text, I'll refer briefly to the antecedents of the

17

statute.

and the language was so construed by the Ninth Circuit, one

QUESTION:

13

And

Because --

Now that you've been interrupted, Mr.

14

Shapiro, how do you respond to Mr. Bender's argument that it

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

to realize that this language covered

I would respond by saying that the firs t

18

time that it came up which was 1958, the SEC filed an action

19

to restrain the fraudulent pledges and it was affirmed by the

20

Second Circuit, that was the first occasion that it arose and

21

the Commission has taken that position ever since.

22

is no hiatus in the Commission's interpretation.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

So there

Well you don't mean that there were no

instances of the fraudulent pledges between 1933 and 1958?
MR. SHAPIRO:

There were none that were -- that I'm
25

1

aware of that were brought to the Commission's attention.

2

Certainly the Commission never interpreted the statute dif­

3

ferently than it is now interpreting it; it's been a consis­

4

tent interpretation ever since this issue first came up in

5

litigation in '58.

6

Because the language that Congress has used is un­

7

ambiguous and is not at odds with the legislative history,

8

it's unnecessary to dwell at any length on the contentions of

9

policy or statutory purpose that Petitioner has presented in

10

his brief.

11

those contentions are supportive of his position.

But I wouldn't want to leave the impression that

To the extent that policy is relevant here, it

supports the government's interpretation.

is nothing in the statute which suggests that the nature of
the risk assumed by the victim of the fraud has any relevance.
I need hardly point out, moreover, that Congress has not
defined these terms

12
13
14
15

18

It would therefore be most

inappropriate to construe a criminal statute such as Section
17(a) by reference to these undefined concepts.
Congress has drafted the statute without ambiguities,
to apply to every disposition of an interest in a security
for value.

It makes no difference that that disposition

occurs in a commercial or

a

business environment, or that

involves a risk that might be characterized as having commer­
cial attributes.

which Petitioner relies on.

realities of the transactions in which he engaged, the reality

of those transactions was that the bank gave value and acquiree

in this case?

9
10

That would certainly be covered, and

it may be that the statute reaches a bit beyond that, but --

Does there have to be a misrepresentation

-- we don't have to reach that here,

since the fraud went directly to the value of these certifi­

We don't take it terribly seriously,

18

and the welfare of those banks and the nation's banking

19

system, is of profound importance to the federal government.

20

It's therefore not surprising that Congress expected that the

21

federal securities laws would play an important role in pro­

22

tecting banks against this kind of misconduct.

Most banks today are insured by the federal government,

As Congress stated, in the Securities Exchange Act,

MR. SHAPIRO:

And as Your Honor suggests, the plain meaning is

plain meaning principle.

But in response to Petitioner, I

merely point out the grave policy issues that are stake here.
Congressman Pepper summarized those issues in the hearings on
conversion of worthless securities, where he stated, "our
investigation discloses that there is a national apparatus of
individuals who are continually engaged in organized criminal
conduct, directly concerned with commercial transactions.

The

essence of their activities is to give worthless securities
a facade of value and respectability, and then convert the
worthless paper into hard cash.

These individuals move across

state lines, victimizing small banks, insurance companies and
stock brokerage institutions.

Local law enforcement is entirely

inadequate to cope with the scheme which is planned in
California, prepared in New Jersey, and executed in Ohio."
These hearings refer again and again, to fraudulent pledges
as a primary means for victimizing banking institutions.

QUESTION:

20

These are in 1975?

MR. SHAPIRO:

arguments that the federal government isn't concerned in this
