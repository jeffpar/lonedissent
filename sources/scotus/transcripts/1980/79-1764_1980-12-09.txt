ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY WILSON, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

We will hear arguments

MR. WILSON:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice and may it please the Court:

10

This is a Title VII sex discrimination case in

1 1

which two issues are presented to the Court for resolution.

12

First, what burden is placed on the defendant in a Title VII

13

case after the plaintiff establishes a prirna facie case?

14

a burden to merely establish or to articulate legitimate non-

15

discriminatory reasons, or is it a burden to come forward and

16

prove reliance upon those reasons by a preponderance of the

17

evidence.

18

The second question for resolution is --

19

QUESTION:

20

21

Is it

Well wasn't the first question at least,

all but resolved in the Sweeney case?
MR. WILSON:

That is our contention, Your Honor.

22

believe that the Fifth Circuit completely misconstrued the

23

Sweeney case and -- in the Sweeney case, the issue on appeal

24

was whether the defendant had to prove that there was an

25

absence of discriminatory motive.

We

I personally don't believe
3

1

that there's any difference between that burden of proof and

2

proving by a preponderance of the evidence reliance upon non-

3

discrirainatory reasons.

4

QUESTION:

The Fifth Circuit here equated the

5

articulation of a non-discriminatory reason with proof by a

6

preponderance which I would have thought the Sweeney case was

7

contrary to.
MR. WILSON:

8

9

Yes sir, it was exactly contrary to it.

And we -- the Texas Department of Community Affairs won this

10

case in the District Court and it was partially reversed by the

1 1

Fifth Circuit on this issue.

12

had merely articulated the reason and not proved it by a pre­

12

ponderance of the evidence that we had failed to rebut the

U

plaintiff's prima facie case.

QUESTION:

Yes sir, Your Honor, not by myself.
Their names don't appear in the papers,

at least I can't find them.
MR. WILSON:

Gee.

MR. WILSON:

Judge Gee?

Judges Jones and Clark were on it.

MR. WILSON:

QUESTION:

Jones and Clark?

3

QUESTION:

It's in the brief.

4

MR. WILSON:

Yes sir.
I couldn't find it.

The second question for review is the

5

standard upon which a District Court finding in a Title VII

6

case of either a discriminatory motive in the employment

7

decision or the lack of a discriminatory motive, what standard

8

is that to be reviewed under.

1 1

erroneous.

12

Ms. Burdine was hired by the Texas Department of

13

Community Affairs in January of 1972 as an accounting clerk and

14

was quickly promoted to a coordinating role in the division,

15

in the public service careers division, with some supervisory

16

responsibilities.

Burdine was hired until the following April of

'73, when she was fired, there developed a certain amount of
dissension among Ms.

Burdine and two other employees in the

division, Mr. Roberto Carraveo and Marian Kirkland.

The

public service careers division was wholly funded by the
United States Department of Labor and in February of 1973, the

Department notified the executive director of the Texas Depart­
ment of Community Affairs, Mr. B. R. Fuller, that funding for

the program would cease due to inefficiencies in its admini­

stration.

of fiscal controls in the division, that there had been imprope r

documentation of expenditures, overstaffing and questionable

MR. WILSON:

Right.

However, as this Court has held

a prima facie case is not equivalent

to a factual finding that discrimination took place in the
employment decision.

What the prima facie case does is merely

eliminate the two most common reasons for an employment decis­
ion, the two most common legitimate reasons which are that the
applicant was not qualified for the job or that there was not
a vacancy in the position at the time that he applied.

I understand the question.

We -- I

think that in your concurrence in the Sweeney case, that the
fact that an employee of the agency testifies as to the reasons

7

Now, I think that you could go a step further; I'm

8

not sure the Court would be willing to go this far, and say

9

that the mere -- merely by establishing a prima facie case

10

what the plaintiff does is create a fact question which in

1 1

certain negligence cases would allow the case to go to the

jury and the jury would be --

answer that the real reason is the legitimate reason.

11

MR. WILSON:

They said one and then they said the

3

Because of the difficulty that a plaintiff encounters

in attempting to prove discrimination in the employment con­

1 1

text, what this Court did in McDonnel Douglas was to say that
if you can

eliminate these two most common legitimate reasons

then the defendant will have to come forward and tell you why
he fired you, for instance, in this case.

And I think that

normally you would expect that that would happen in the dis­
covery stage of the trial.

The plaintiff would discover the

reason that the defendant fired him, or that he did not hire

12

him.

13

that those reasons were not the real reasons for the employment

14

decision.

15

Affairs articulated two reasons for the decision with regard to

16

Ms. Burdine, through

17

those were Ms. Burdine's partial responsibility for the prob­

18

lems in the public service careers division pointed out by

19

the Department of Labor and her partial responsibility for

20

dissension in the division.

21

And then would be able to bring out evidence at trial

In this case, the Texas Department of Community

the

testimony of Mr. Fuller.

And

Since, under the Fifth Circuit's burden of proof, if

22

a plaintiff comes forward with his prima facie case and then

23

the defendant is unable to prove by a preponderance of the

24

evidence that he actually relied upon legitimate non-discrim-

25

inatory reasons then the plaintiff automatically wins the case,
12

1

because there has been a failure to rebut the prima facie case.
2
3

5

This completely eliminates the last step in the McDonnel
Douglas test which is the step in which the plaintiff is
allowed to come back and show that the articulated reasons by
the defendant are pretextual.

MR. WILSON:

If the defendant, if he proves that he

left for the plaintiff to show; if he fails to prove it, there's

19

still nothing left for the plaintiff to show because he's

failed to rebut the prima facie case.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Wilson, do you contend on this record

22

that the defendant did prove by a preponderance of the evidence

that there was a valid reason for the discharge?

QUESTION:

Isn't that equivalent to a finding that I

MR. WILSON:

QUESTION:

Isn't that equivalent to a finding of

fact that I believe that Mr. Fuller testified truthfully?

8

MR. WILSON:

9

10

Sir?

QUESTION:

Yes sir.
Then why isn't that a preponderance of the

evidence?

1 1

MR. WILSON:

12

QUESTION:

I guess it would be.
Isn't what the Fifth Circuit did, is

13

establish a rule of law that oral testimony must be corrob­

14

orated?

15
16

17

MR. WILSON:

That's essentially what they did, yes,

Your Honor.
The -- that brings me to the next step in my argu­

18

ment, which is that the finding of the Fifth Circuit that

19

there was not discrimination -- I mean, excuse me, of the

20

District Court that there was not discrimination in this

21

employment decision, was not clearly erroneous because it was

22

supported by that testimony by Mr. Fuller.

23

Circuit improperly intruded upon the fact finding authority

24

of the District Court when it undertook an independent review

25

of the evidence in which it credited some of the evidence of
14

And the Fifth

1

the plaintiff and discredited some of the evidence of the
2

defendant.

And this is kind of a fact question, the motiva­

3

tion for an employment decision which the District Courts are
4

required to decide on a daily basis in the -- for instance
5

in the Mount Healthy cases, First Amendment cases, in which
6

the plaintiff is alleging that he's been fired for making a
7

First Amendment speech.
8
9

10

11

12
13
14

15

this instance that sex discrimination was not the motivating
factor for the decision to fire Ms. Burdine, should have been
accorded the deference that a fact finding is due by the
Appellate Court and it should have been affirmed by the Fifth
Circuit and for that reason, as well as the failure of the
Fifth Circuit to apply the proper burden of proof, I believe
that the Fifth Circuit's decision in this case should be
reversed and the judgment of the District Court reinstated.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19

21

Mr. Gill.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HUBERT L. GILL, ESQ.,

18

20

And the District Court's finding in

MR. GILL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Initially I would speak on the -- just briefly to

22

the fact issue raised by the counsel for the Petitioner.

23

said that there was proof in the record that the plaintiff

24

Joyce Ann Burdine was involved in dissension within the agency

25

and that there was proof that she was at least partially
15

He

1

responsible for some deficiencies in the program.

I believe

2

a close review of the record will indicate that the only evi­
3

dence of that in the record whatsoever was Mr. Fuller's state­
4

ments to that effect, that other than that, the evidence
5

indicated as the Court of Appeals found, not only was that not
6
7

8
9

10

11

12

13
14

true, that she was not involved in any dissension, that the
dissension had occurred and it started before she was ever
employed at the agency, that the executive director himself
was at least partially responsible for it, and that she did
not have authority to deal with it anyway, and she had written
memorandums to her supervisors bringing forth this problem
of -- within her division, concerning the deficiencies.

The

executive director was completely unable to point to any
specific area where she was deficient in her job, and he said

15

that there was no way to tell whether she was responsible as

16

opposed to any other person within that division, or even him­

17

self.

18

Therefore, the evidence indicated that not only did

19

the plaintiff establish her prima facie case, but the evidence

20

of defendant substantiated the plaintiff's prima facie case.

21

Initially, I would distinguish this case from Sweeney and

22

McDonnel and Furnco, on one important ground.

23

brought out by the Fifth Circuit, Judge Gee, in this opinion,

24

and earlier in Turner v. Texas Instruments.

25

in Furnco and in Sweeney, you have a situation where the reason
16

And this was

In McDonnel and

1

given by the employer, the -- in articulating a legitimate,

2

non-discriminatory reason, is undisputed.

3

the plaintiff had a bad absence record.

4

undisputed in those cases.

5

shifts to the plaintiff who is not arguing that he or she did

6

not have a bad attendance record but that that was not actually

7

the reason, that was not actually the reason for what the

8

employer did and that there was another reason.

9

pretextual

in nature.

Such as for example,
That is basically

The burden at that point then

That was

Now what the Fifth Circuit is saying

10

in this case is that the reason given by the employer, that is,

11

that the plaintiff was involved in some dissension in the pro­

12

gram and that she was responsible for some deficiencies within

13

the agency, that is disputed initially.

14

requiring, all the Fifth Circuit is requiring, is for the

15

employer to have to prove that the reasons they state is

16

actually the reason for what they did.

17

QUESTION:

And all the Court is

Well Mr. Gill, don't you think there's a

18

certain inconsistency between the two sentences in the Fifth

19

Circuit's opinion that I read your opposing counsel, where it

20
21

22

says defendant may refute plaintiff's prima facie case by
articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the
rejection and then, this court requires the defendant to prove
non-discriminatory reasons by a preponderance of the evidence?
MR. GILL:

Your Honor, I am certain if I were writing

the opinion I would not have used the term preponderance of the
17

1

evidence.

However, I think it is applicable in this case,

2

and I would argue that regardless of that, that the Plaintiff
3

proved her case by a preponderance of the evidence but I don't
4

think that the Court followed the wrong standard for the
5

6
7

8
9

10

1 1

12

reason that I mentioned, that initially, we do not ever get to
the question of pretext in this case.

I think the Court

properly, and I think the evidence is clear,

recognized the

correct legal standard.
There were three issues involved, and I think the
case has to be put in perspective.

The first issue was the

plaintiff argued that she should have been promoted.

The

Court of Appeals, on that issue, affirmed the decision of the

13

lower court and in doing so, said that the plaintiff had

14

established a prima facie case, that the defendant/employer

15

had articulated a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its

16

conduct; the burden then shifted back to the plaintiff who was

17

unable to show that this was pretextual

18

I think it's clear that the Court did recognize the proper

19

legal standard.

20

in nature.

Therefore,

Concerning the issue involved in this case, with the

21

Court's permission, the Court said we don't have to reach

22

the standard of the question of pretext, because the employer
has never proven that the reasons given were the actual reasons
And I think this Court, I don't think this is inconsistent with
Sweeney, and with Furnco -18

Maybe if you had been writing the opinion

you wouldn't have

-- I mean, to switch your language a bit --

you wouldn't have

used the word articulated?

MR. GILL:

Well, I think the word articulated --

QUESTION:

But you're already bound by the use of

the word here.
MR. GILL:

The word articulate, I think, in this

context as set forth in McDonnel Douglas, has been a problem
for lower courts,

the Court of Appeals and the District

Court, as to exactly what is the meaning of articulate.

1 1

QUESTION:

Well, what do you think it means?

MR. GILL:

I

forth in a First Circuit case following Sweeney, Loeb v.

15

Textron, Incorporated, in which that was a case after Sweeney,

16

after Furnco, in which the First Circuit speaks to the question

17

of what is actually articulating, and states that it must be

18

sufficient, the evidence must be sufficient on its face to

19

rebut or dispel the inference of discrimination that rises

20

from proof of a prima facie case.

QUESTION:

But now isn't that contrary, Mr. Gill, to

22

the very language in Sweeney, on page 24, where we -- the Court

23

said "while words such as articulate, show and prove may have

24

more or less similar meanings depending upon the context in

25

which they are used, we think there is a significant distinction

between merely articulating some legitimate non-discriminatory
reason and proving absence of discriminatory motive"?

MR. GILL:

There certainly is a problem.

I would

point out to the Court that in this particular case, there
was no requirement that the defendant/employer prove the

17

employer said it was.

18
19

20
21

I would argue that this Court even recognized the

QUESTION:

But you would agree that it means something

less than proving the absence of a discriminatory motive?
MR. GILL:

Yes, I would say that and I think the

Court has clearly held that it's not the burden of the employer
to prove that.
QUESTION:

Do you think that something else, as Mr.

Justice Rehnquist has described it, might be the existence of a
reason, not necessarily that that was the reason that prevailed,
20

1

but at least the existence of a legitimate reason?

2

HR.

GILL:

I think it should be the existence of a

3

legitimate reason and that it should be articulated with

4

enough specificity to actually identify that as being the

5

reason.

6

QUESTION:

Well in any event,

I suppose you would

agree that the language chosen by the Court of Appeals for

the Fifth Circuit, at least in this case, is not quite accur­

MR. GILL: -- rather than her.
QUESTION:

If you just read his opinion you certainly

would come to the conclusion he believed Mr. Fuller.
MR. GILL:

But I would argue that the opinion is so

vague in the sense of applying the McDonnel Douglas test, and
that's just what Judge Gee held in the Fifth Circuit.
QUESTION:

No, because Judge Gee didn't send it back

for another trial or another opinion, he entered -- he directed

that judgment be entered in her favor.

MR. GILL:

Right.

And of course that goes to the

second question of whether an independent review of the facts

can be made under the East v. Romine doctrine.

I think there's other evidence that would indicate that the

It mentioned terms such as this was a rational decision on the

6

part of the employer, that decision was wrought in good faith,

7

did not speak at all to the McDonnell Douglas standard nor to

the requirements of the employer or the plaintiff in that type

of a situation.

again, to the second part of it, that the Court was obligated,

1 1

the Fifth Circuit Court to make an independent review of the

facts.

13

of the facts, is a legitimate rule that has been adopted by the

14

Fifth Circuit, it's an old standing rule in numerous types of

15

cases, cases where the ultimate finding of law is also an

16

ultimate finding of fact, and that the Fifth Circuit adopted

17

this rule in Title VII cases --

18
19

I would argue that that -- making an independent review

QUESTION:

You're not contending that the Rules of

Civil Procedure are not applicable to Title VII cases, are you?

20

MR. GILL:

No, I'm not.

21

QUESTION:

And that would include Rule 52(a).

22

MR. GILL:

That's correct.

But I think the evidence

23

in this case makes it obvious that if you, for example, on the

24

question of upgrading, or promotion, in which the Court of

25

Appeals affirmed the District Court, the judge wrote that after
26

1

making an independent review of the record he was convinced

2

that the finding of the District Court was not clearly erron­

3

eous.

4

erroneous test, he simply avoided the necessity of sending this

5

case back to the District Court, of saying we need more

6

findings of fact, and bringing it back -- this case was filed

7

in 1973 and it's been on the books this far -- this long at this

8

point, if it had to be sent back to the District Court, sent

9

back to the Fifth Circuit, I think the rule is

Therefore, I think he in fact used the clearly

1 1

it's particularly necessary where there are insufficient find­

12

ings of subsidiary facts as there were in this case and par­

13

ticularly important in Title VII cases, where discrimination is

14

a hard thing to prove, where the facts are always relevant,

15

particularly in a disparate treatment case, the particular facts

16

are extremely relevant and therefore, it's certainly a rule

and even the state, in its brief, admitted the efficacy of that

rule.

rule.

20

21
22
23
24

25

And I would argue that the Court should not disturb that

Speaking briefly again on the nature of the type of
evidence needed to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory
reason, by the employer, I do not believe that thi's Court has
of yet, clearly defined, nor has any Court, clearly defined
exactly what is meant by articulation of a reason and what type
of evidence is necessary.

In this case, I would argue that the
27

1

evidence given by the employer was completely hypothetical
2

in nature.

There was subjective standards used, statements

3

such as "I feel like he was better qualified", "I made my
4

decision based on the recommendations of subordinates", first
5

off being hearsay, secondly, the subordinates themselves may
6

have discriminated, there was no comparative-type of data of
7

any kind introduced, as was pointed out -8

QUESTION:

But then aren't you still saying that he

9

has to prove non-discrimination rather than simply articulate
10

1 1

12

13
14

15
16

a reason?
MR. GILL:

Well, if you're speaking of articulate in

that sense, Justice Rehnquist, in the sense of just stating
it, in other words, just making an oral statement

-- if that

is articulate, then I would argue that that is not enough.
QUESTION:

Then what do you do with Sweeney?

MR. GILL:

VJell I would argue that that is not in

17

direct conflict with Sweeney.

18

writing the opinion you stated that --

That in Sweeney, when -- in

19

QUESTION:

It was a per curiam opinion, I think.

20

MR. GILL:

Right.

But there was a statement by the

21

Court in Footnote 2, saying that the petitioners in Sweeney

22

did produce evidence to support their legitimate non-discrim-

23

inatory explanation.

24

that some evidence other than simply an explanation,

25

oral statement, is necessary.

In other words, the Court was stating
an

And certainly Sweeney did contai n
28

1

that other type of evidence such as another female had recom­

2

mended Sweeney for the job -- I mean, made an unfavorable

3

recommendation to her, another female had taken her place --

4

there was other evidence highly qualified males had not been

5

promoted as well as Ms. Sweeney.

6

that the Court pointed out and that was in that record that is

7

not in the record in this case.

8
9

And there was other evidence

So I would argue that Sweeney is not in conflict
and that the Court has not clearly recognized or stated the

10

standard that must be followed.

QUESTION:

15

And I would urge the Court to

But he said proof by a preponderance of

the evidence.
MR. GILL:

17

Again, Your Honor, as I stated, I don't

18

agree particularly with the language involved there, but I

19

would point out that -QUESTION:

20

We have to assume that that language

21

reflected his state of mind and his analytical processes, don’t

22

we ?

23
24

25

MR. GILL:

Well, I think that we need to look at

exactly what he applied that to.

And I think that what he was

saying and what the Court in Loeb was saying is that the
29

1

plaintiff, in any kind of a case, has the opportunity and should
2

have the opportunity to disprove the reason given by the
3

employer; that if the employer says the reason --- for example,
4

the reason that I fired her was because she had a poor atten­
5

dance record, that the plaintiff should have the opportunity
6

as in this case to introduce evidence and show -- she doesn't
7

have -- I don't have a poor attendance record, I was in
8

attendance every day.

And that, in that case, we're not

9

switching the burden of proof to the defendant, we're just
10

11

saying the defendant, employer, has not even rebutted the
prima facie case set forth by the plaintiff.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

steps 1 and 2 in McDonnel, and that steps 3 and 4 were never
brought into play?

15
16

17

So you say that this case involves only

MR. GILL:

That is correct.

Because, I think it's

clear that the Court stated, and I think it spoke specifically
to that point, that they are simply -- that it said that

18

defendant may refute plaintiff's prima facie case by articulati ng

19

a legitimate and non-discriminatory reason.

20

state that in this case, on this particular issue, that the

21

plaintiff -- all the evidence in the record completely disprove

22

the reason given by the employer for his conduct.

23

you don't even have to go to the third step.

24

certainly

25

issue of non-promotion it reached the third step.

It goes on to

Therefore,

I think the Court

recognized the third step because on the first

30

It said

'laintiff had presented a prima facie case, defendant/employer

2

had articulated a legitimate non-discrirninatory reason, but

3

plaintiff was unable to prove that this was pretext, pretextual

4

in nature.

5

dence, the employer on the issue of promotion, prevailed.

6

However, concerning the issue of termination, simply saying

7

that plaintiff's prima facie case was so strong

8

dant/employer's case was so weak and unsupported by the evidence

9

that the prima facie case was not rebutted and therefore

And therefore,that the preponderance of the evi­

and the defen­

plaintiff prevailed on a -- by a preponderance of the evidence.

about earlier.

produces a prima facie case and evidence of negligence in an

14

automobile accident case.

15

engineers testimony, let's say that the defendant ran a red

16

light, and the defendant simply gets up and says I don't think

17

it happened that way, it

18

Court at that point, I think is able to say, that the defen­

19

dant has not -- the plaintiff has presented the prima facie

20

case, the defendant has not dispelled or rebutted that, and

21

therefore, the finding would be proper for the plaintiff.

22
23
24

25

What happens if the plaintiff, for example,

QUESTION:

Produces ten eye-witnesses and

happened some other way.

And the

Well what if the trial court 'in the hypo­

thesis you just gave, on -- contrary to its conclusion as you
stated, said the plaintiff has produced ten witnesses, the
defendant had simply testified himself, but I believe the
31

1

defendant and not the ten witnesses of the plaintiff and
2

therefore I enter judgment for the defendant.

Now would there

3

be anything wrong with that, unless the Appellate Court were
4

to say the finding were clearly erroneous?
5

MR. GILL:

No, there wouldn't.

And I certainly

6

wouldn't argue that the judge or the jury or whatever may be
7

involved, has the right to believe who they want to believe.

However, I think that is not applicable in this particular
situation.

Because number one, I think it is unclear

-- or it is clear that the District Court did not apply the
proper standards from the beginning.

It never even started,

as to whether the plaintiff had presented a prima facie case.
It used questions of good faith and rational conduct as the
test.

And I think that the evidence in this case is so over­

whelming as found by the Fifth Circuit to indicate that the
finding was clearly erroneous.

As a matter of law.
