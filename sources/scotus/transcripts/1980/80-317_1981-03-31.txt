MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2

We will hear arguments

first this morning in University of Texas v. Camenisch.

4

Mr. Zwiener.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LONNY F. ZWIENER, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ZWIENER:

7

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

9

This case involves the Rehabilitation Act of 1973

10

and especially the last provision of that Act, Section 504,

11

which reads, "no other qualified handicapped individual will

12

be excluded from or denied the benefits in any program or

13

activity receiving federal financial assistance."

14

Now, in the Rehabilitation Act there were many

15

sections, there were many programs, all of which set up

16

appropriated money to accomplish the program.

17

were sort of catch-all statutes at the end:

18

discriminate against the handicapped in any program receiving

19

financial assistance.

20

504 and 503
you will not

Petitioners' first point, and I think I can charac­

21

terize it as what we consider the most important point, is

22

that 504 does not require the expenditure of any money by

23

an institution, no affirmative action; it's a neutral statute

24

which says that we will not discriminate the handicapped.

25

You can participate; we will not deny you participation in a
3

1

program or activity if you are able to participate in it.
We say that for the Federal Government to require

2
3

any type of affirmative action toward the handicapped, it

4

will require a statute that's tied to the spending power of

5

Congress.

6

Clause, again only requires the states to be neutral.

The Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection

QUESTION:

7

May I ask, Mr. Zwiener, your position is

8

that there's absolutely no affirmative obligation under any

9

circumstances toward the handicapped?

No affirmative obliga­

10

tion?

Let me put this hypothetical to you.

Suppose there is

11

no way of getting to classes except by climbing several

12

flights of stairs and you have a handicapped person who has tc

13

use a wheelchair.

Do you have to provide a ramp?

14

MR. ZWIENER:

15

QUESTION:

16

handicapped person?

I beg your pardon?

Do you have to provide a ramp for that

17

MR. ZWIENER:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. ZWIENER:

We would say not.

Say not?
We would say not, unless it's a pro­

20

gram in which, which is designed to educate this handicapped

21

in some way.

22

QUESTION:

23

program.

24

for example.

25

I'm assuming that's what it is, it's a

You do have programs.

He wants to be a teacher,

He can't get to the classrooms unless he has --

MR. ZWIENER:

No, we would also say, we would also

say that it's not an affirmative action statute under any

2

-- circumstance.

QUESTION:

Right.

5

MR. ZWIENER:

6

QUESTION:

7

8
9

And you don't even have to pro­

That's true.

'■!

That's what we would say

Unless you get the federal money to

finance the program?
MR. ZWIENER:
we're saying.

That's true, Your Honor.

That's what

Now, as I said, we think that the Fourteenth

10

Amendment requires no more, so we do have to tie, Congress

11

cannot dictate to the states or to state institutions or a

12

private employer that they provide affirmative action unless

13

they tie it to some money given for a particular program whicl

14

the handicapped is a beneficiary of.

15

Now, I think we need to make one point clear.

16

The University of Texas, who is the petitioner in this case,

17

is not heartless, nor are the-'6'ther institutions in the State

18

of Texas, and this case itself will not bankrupt the Univer­

19

sity of Texas, nor will it bankrupt the smallest state college

20

in Texas, the interpreter in this case.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ZWIENER:

Too many oil wells down there.
Yes, Your Honor, that has helped the

23

University of Texas and Texas ASM.

24

down there are not pleased with the fact that these two

25

institutions are getting it all.
5

The other universities

1

Well, to be perfectly frank, Mr. Justice Marshall,

2

the University of Texas may be the richest university in the

3

country now, more heavily endowed because of its oil proper­

4

ties than even Harvard University.

he spends the rest of his career, academic career, with an

4

interpreter that the University must provide him under the

5

theory that Walter Camenisch, the respondent, and the other

6

amici that' support their position want.
Now, to carry it to the extreme — and really this

7

8

is

— if you read the briefs, and, gosh, I can't even remem­

ber them all, because they're just too many; it's difficult

10

for me to decide who supports what position, but otherwise --

11

he's otherwise qualified, without the handicap.

And they're required to take affirmative action under it;

academic programs, it does provide deaf interpreters where

We’ve got a state statute that forbids us from discriminating

against the handicapped and makes us make building altera­

So we have spent a lot of money.
My feelings and sentiments -- I was interested,

unfortunate tragedy as far as the President is concerned,

Mr. Zwiener, do you know of any evidence

that is less reliable in a courtroom than a newspaper?
MR. ZWIENER:

16

You're right, Your

Honor.

You're

17

right, Your Honor.

I certainly endorse that, but here, George

ing about elevators for, I believe, seven handicapped people;

21

too much for the return.

22

the handicapped but society can only support so much, and

23

we’re saying that this statute, as respondents would have us

24

to interpret it, just the imagination boggles.

25

why we’re up here with this case.

So the expenditure, they’re just — you have to spend
And again, I’m not unsympathetic to

8

And that is

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Zwiener, I take it your real posi­

2

tion is that the regulation that the Government has promul­

3

gated is not authorized by the statute, is that -- ?

4

Because you would concede that the regulation would require

5

that you provide the interpreter?

6

MR. ZWIENER:

7

QUESTION:

8

That's true, Your Honor.
So, basically, the question is whether

the regulation is valid or not?
MR. ZWIENER:

9

Well, it's also a question whether

10

the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit is

11

correct in saying, not just under the regulations, I think,

12

but I think they went under the statute, so we do have that

13

decision.

14

as many courts have interpreted this statute, that they're

15

incorrect.

16

We're saying that that's incorrect.

We're saying,

Now, our second point is that 504 does not confer

17

a private cause of action.

18

point before this Court decided Maine v. Thiboutot, because

19

I'm not sure exactly how to handle this private cause of ac­

20

tion now, since perhaps we don't have to state it but"just

21

have a statute and have a beneficiary, and then we have a

22

1983 cause of action.

23

I would have rather argued this

But I would say that Congress can enact a statute

24

like this one, and certainly it could have put explicit lan­

25

guage in the statute that would say, private plaintiffs
9

1

cannot bring suit; we do not mean this statute to cover that

2

type of situation.

3

more comfortable arguing this point before the Maine v.

4

Thiboutot case, if I am pronouncing it anywheres close to

5

being right.

6

Again, as I say, I would have been much

Now, something that's not in our brief is an amend­

7

ment to the rehabilitation statute, which is 505.

8

point this out.

9

brief and the brief

And I

I feel that the respondent in the principal
of the Civil Liberties Union and its

10

companion amici are misquoting 505.

11

have 505, which does permit private causes of action in cer­

12

tain circumstances, there's no question.

13

in terms of a private cause of action going to 504.

14

look at the statute, it goes to 501, which is an employment

15

type of statute, and under that statute a private cause of

16

action is authorized.

17

are authorized, but not 504, as is said by respondent, and

18

also the brief for the American Civil Liberties Union and

19

its companions on the brief.

20

They say that now that we

However, they talk
If you

All the remedies provided by Title VI

As a matter of fact, that’s the strongest evidence,

21

I think, that we have of congressional intent, is that they

22

did provide a private cause of action for a program designed

23

to increase the employment of the handicapped, which is 501,

24

but did not; 504.

25

the statute correctly.

And as I say, I think that I’m reading

10

1

Now, our third point is -- and this is critical;;'it

2

ties into the first point -- that 504 refers to a program

3

and activity that receives federal financial assistance

4

and that’s what it means,

5

cause the University of Texas Maritime Center down on the

6

coast gets a grant to study the fishing conditions in the

7

Gulf of Mexico doesn't mean that 504 applies to Freshman

8

English in Austin.

QUESTION:

a program and activity.

Just be­

This argument, according to your bro­

ther, was not raised until now, in this case.

11

MR. ZWIENER:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ZWIENER:

We are saying that —

Is that correct?
That’s true.

It was raised in the

14

petition for rehearing en banc in the 5th Circuit.

15

try this case in the trial court nor I didn’t handle the

16

original brief.

17

in the 5th Circuit and put the argument into the petition for

18

rehearing en banc, and then before this Court.

19

it is properly before this Court because it’s a jurisdic­

20

tional question.

21

I did not

I did make the argument for the first time

You see, it's a threshold question.

We say that

A plaintiff can­

22

not show that he's entitled to any relief without first show­

23

ing that the program about which he's complaining receives

24

federal financial assistance.

25

threshold question which must be proved.

Again, we're saying that's a

11

1

Now, we do have some briefs here that say that it's

2

our burden to prove that the program does not.

I would say

3

that would go in the teeth of a very, of a decision this

4

Court rendered just a short time ago involving a Texas agency

5

the Texas Department of Human Resources v. Burdine, where

6

someone sues because he's been discriminated against; he's

7

got to show a little discrimination first before the defen­

8

dant has to do anything.

9

the program-specific, is jurisdictional.

And we're saying that this question
The burden is on

10

the plaintiff to prove it before he could even go forward

with anything in his case.

dictional question.

Counsel, the court of appeals said that

16

the University of Texas is the recipient of over $31 million

17

of federal assistance and has agreed to comply with Section

18

504 as a condition to continued receipt of federal funds.

19

HR. ZWIENER:

Well, we did stipulate that the

20

University got $31 million.

We didn't stipulate, so far as I

21

know, that we agreed to comply.

22

program that's funded by the Federal Government -- and I

23

would say that of that $31 million I don't know that anybody

24

knows whether those are student loans, by the way, or whether

25

it's just grants and that sort of thing, but let's take the

Now, each program, each

ordinary grant.

A proposal may be paid to the University or some­

times the Federal Government, some agency that needs some

research done, will come to the state.

so much for this, so much for that.

But that is true.

So, I would say that we haven't stipulated our­

If you're right, then, you could have

18

right, just on the ground that you don't like deaf people?

MR. ZWIENER:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ZWIENER:

22

QUESTION:

23

Is that

No, sir, we could not do that.

Why not?

Why not?

No.

If you agree

to programs that are supported with federal money?

MR. ZWIENER:

25

QUESTION:

That's true.
And he wants to be, say, an English

1

major and the English Department doesn't get any federal

funds, you could say, we don't want deaf people in the

3

English Department.

4

MR. ZWIENER:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ZWIENER:

No, sir.

Why not?
No, sir, we could not do that.

We

7

could deny him admission to the University if he did not have

8

the entrance requirements, even though he would say, I had a

9

more difficult getting my education because I am deaf and

10

therefore I am not in the top quarter of my class, or I don't

11

have a certain score on the SAT.

12

passing these tests because of my disability.

13

not — if he had the scores —- we could not say, we do not

like deaf people —

MR. ZWIENER:

17

I have a difficult time
But we could

Why not?
— we don't like blind people, we

don't like funny-looking people

QUESTION:

19

prevent you from saying that?

20

Just say, we.don't allow deaf people in the English Depart­

21

ment?

22

I'm asking you, what is it that would

MR. ZWIENER:

Why couldn't you say that?

We could say it, and I would say that

if we did that, and they were otherwise qualified, brought

their own interpreter along, were able —

I'm asking you, you keep saying you

from doing it?

But is there a federal law that prevented you

MR. ZWIENER:

QUESTION:

504; it's in the statute.

Then you do not — what happens to your

argument that that only applies to programs that are funded

you're right.

Because --

QUESTION:

9

All right; you're right, Your Honor,

Not very possibly.

Under your argument

you have an absolute right to.

15

MR. ZWIENER:

16

QUESTION:

That's true.

That's true.

Do I correctly understand that he has

17

been allowed to have interpreters in the classes from time

18

to time?

19

MR. ZWIENER:

Yes, sir, he was always allowed inter­

20

preters, and we would say, the reasonable accommodation which

21

Southeast Community College v. Davis refers to is permitting

22

an interpreter to be present, permitting an interpreter to

23

distract, if you will -- and there are some people that

24

fussed about some of our city council meetings.

But, yes, I think we have to make that
And we would have to -- a professor

That kind of accommodation.

And what's the source of the obligation

to make that kind of accommodation? 504?
MR. ZWIENER:

Well, I would say -- without buying

all of my argument, my argument ultimately

goes, as indi­

10

cated, to the fact that 504 doesn't require us to do anything

11

unless the program receives federal financial monies.

12

But if it has any effect on just a general handicap situa­

13

tion -- you see, I would say, ultimately —

14
15
16

QUESTION:

I'd still like to know what's the source

of the obligation to make that accommodation.
MR. ZWIENER:

Is it 504?

Well, I would say it's this Court's

17

opinion in Southeastern Community College v. Davis.

18

ment, of course, goes a little further than that.

19

ment goes to the fact that the Fourteenth Amendment —

Now, I’m not —■ I must be dense this morning.

10

Since this Court construed 504 to do something, I'm saying

11

that you have decided it must do something.

12

back to your question, Your Honor, and your question, in a

13

way, our state statute -- we have a state antidiscrimination

14

statute that would require us to admit the deaf student and

15

not discriminate on account of this particular handicap, and

16

we say that’s entirely within the powers of the state without

17

the Federal Government.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

Now, to get

Does your state statute reach so far as

to require that you provide the deaf with an interpreter?
MR. ZWIENER:

No, Your Honor, it does not.

Actually,

21

one of the problems that we've had in this case, and again I

22

think these monies are confused in some of the amicus briefs

23

— there's a lot of money that goes to the states for assist­

24

ance to the handicapped, but it does not go to the universi­

25

ties, it goes to the Texas Rehabilitation Commission.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN J. POLLAK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17

MR. POLLAK:

18
19

20

Mr. Poliak.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I would like to address my argument to the primary

21

issue here, which is whether Regulation 84.44(d) is within

22

the authority conferred by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation

23

Act, as that regulation was applied in this case to require

24

provision of an interpreter to a qualified handicapped person

25

who had been admitted to the master's degree program of
18

1

Texas University in Education.

QUESTION:

3

MR.

4

QUESTION:

POLLAK:

Mr.

Poliak —

Yes, sir?
It's pretty clear, is it not, that the

5

statute does not and cannot mean exactly what it says?

6

says that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual shall

7

solely by reason of his handicap be excluded from participa­

8

tion in any program receiving federal financial assistance.

9

Well, let's assume a blind person who would like to be a

10

bus driver in a city transportation system that receives

11

federal assistance, and except for his blindness he would be

12

qualified-

13

driver because of his handicap, because he's blind.

14
15

It

but he can clearly be excluded from being a bus

MR.

POLLAK:

Yes sir, we accept that, that' s the interpre­

tation in Mr , Justice Powell '"s opinion for the unanimousyCourt.

16

QUESTION:

17

what it says?

18

MR.

POLLAK:

But the statute does not mean precisely

No, it's admitted in spite of, and

19

that's clearly made in the Powell opinion for the Court in

20

Southeastern Community College, and this case does not

21

re-present that issue; indeed the HEW regulations make that

22

clear.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, the would-be airplane pilot without

hands presents that issue.
MR.

POLLAK:

No, to the extent that the argument

19

1

presented by my worthy colleague suggested that we're taking

2

a position that persons may be required to be admitted who

3

cannot press the buttons.

4

Indeed, Your Honor, the case comes to the Court on a stipu­

5

lated record which we think is significant.

6

that Camenisch is a deaf man; (2) that he is a qualified

7

handicapped person, meeting all the academic and technical

8

requirements of the program; (3) that he needs the services

9

of an interpreter --

10
11

12

QUESTION:

We are not taking that position.

And that

he

It provides (1)

is such, quite apart from

his handicap?
MR. POLLAK:

That's correct.

Indeed, the record

13

establishes that this man has gone through, completed, and re­

14

ceived his master's degree, so he —

15

QUESTION:

He's not somebody who would be qualified

16

except for his handicap. He is somebody who is qualified

17

despite his handicap.

18

MR. POLLAK:

That's correct.

That is a stipulated

19

fact, Texas has stipulated he is a qualified handicapped

20

individual.

21

from the Southeastern Community College case, which was an

22

admissions case.

That is a major distinction, from this case,

QUESTION:

6

As I understand it the regulations im­

pose this obligation only in institutions of higher learning,

8

is that correct?
MR. POLLAK:

9

We are speaking about, Mr. Justice

10

Stewart, subpart (e) which applies only to postsecondary insti­

11

tutions; that's correct.

12

secondary institutions.
QUESTION:

13
14

I: 'And

84.44(d) applies to post­

And is there any such requirement on

secondary" institutions Or below?
MR. POLLAK:

15

Elementary and secondary schools,

16

which is a different subpart, do have a requirement for the

17

children to be provided with interpreters, as HEW has inter­

18

preted its regulations.

19

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

20

That is not raised in this case.

But, I would think if the statute means

21

what you say it means, then the obligation would run through­

22

out.

23

MR. POLLAK:

I think, while the HEW regulations for

24

higher education have been drawn with the concerns expressed

25

by universities and colleges during the comment period
21

1

respecting costs, and so as to provide a limited obligation.

2

I don't want to suggest that "the obligation" runs throughout,

3

because I think it's —

4

QUESTION:

Well, the statute doesn't seem to permit

5

any compromise or accommodation.

6

or it isn't.

7

MR. POLLAK:

It's either an obligation

The obligation imposed by the statute

8

runs throughout; that's right.

9

charged with its application has drawn regulations which limit

10

the obligation in several respects, and I am not master of the

11

regulations which they have drawn respecting the elementary

12

and secondary schools, since that was not the issue that

13

arises here, but rather 84.44(d) as Your Honor suggests,

14

which applies to the postsecondary schools.

15

QUESTION:

The administrative agency

And there is a different and lesser

16

obligation imposed upon secondary and primary educational

17

institutions?

18

MR. POLLAK:

No, I don't represent that.

What I

19

was representing was that HEW in 44(d) drew a limited regula­

20

tion which there's some indication in Mr.*Zwiener's argument

21

that the University may in certain circumstances not be re­

22

quired to provide an interpreter.

24

it would not need an interpreter, but if the situation is

What does the record show, if anything,

10

Mr. Poliak, about the financial ability of this respondent to

11

provide his own interpreters?
MR. POLLAK:

12

The record and stipulation indicates

13

that Mr. Camenisch and his wife had earnings in excess of

14

$23,000.

15

The record shows that the University received an application

16

for financial aid from Mr. Camenisch and that it found him

17

not eligible for financial aid.

18

University of Texas has urged that the regulation is satis­

19

fied by a financial means test.

20

is not satisfied.

Mr. Camenisch's earnings were $11,600, I believe.

We do not believe that the

Then what would you say if the record

We would take the same position, Your

Honor.

In other words, the University must pro­

And, indeed, the HEW regulations

We do not understand, Mr. Chief Justice, that Texas

10

has urged upon this Court that it satisfies the regulation

11

except as it may have argued this morning by a financial

12

means test.

13

that Texas says that, concedes that 44(d) of the HEW regula­

14

tions provides an entitlement to the provision of an inter­

15

preter, and so we come before the court this morning and urge

16

that 44(d) with its provision of the entitlement is within

17

the statute and lawful, and entitles Mr. Camenisch as the

18

two courts below ruled to the provision of the interpreter;

19

and we say that the legislative history and words of 504

20

show that Congress had in mind an equal opportunity for the

21

handicapped, that it sought to provide against the effective

22

exclusion of the handicapped from programs to which they were

23

admitted.

Senator Humphrey expresses it -- that the concern is not only

Mr. Poliak, what's the evidence as to

the amount of the federal support for this particular pro­

MR.

9

POLLAK:

Your Honor, the stipulation provides

10

-- pages 30, 31, and 32 — that the University of Texas

11

receives $31.4 million.

12

The stipulation further provides that this man is admitted to

13

the graduate program in the University.

14

that the program specificity issue has been presented to

15

any of the courts below, that it was not briefed, it was not

16

argued, it was not decided, and indeed to the extent that it

17

is in the petition for rehearing it was not ruled on by the

18

court of appeals for the 5th Circuit.

Suppose it

had been argued and decided below, what would your position

here be?

1

QUESTION.:'' Or suppose it is jurisdictional?

2

HR. POLLAK:

My position is that the aid received

3

by this University, $31.4 million, aid to the University

4

satisfies the requirement of 504.

Mr. Camenisch is an ad­

5

mitted student to the University.

The stipulation provides

6

the University receives $31.4 million.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. POLLAK:

9

That's satisfied.

So you feel it’s a false issue?
Your Honor, I feel that the issue has

not been litigated and presented, and indeed there are inter­

10

rogatories in the tail end of this brief in which

11

Mr. Camenisch sought, following the decision on the prelimi­

12

nary injunction, this case arises before this Court on a

13

preliminary injunction needed by Mr. Camenisch in order that

14

he could attend the summer session.

15

in the case which was proceeding ahead on the merits, in whicl

16

Mr. Camenisch sought to elicit, more particularly, information

17

as to the aid received by the University of Texas.
QUESTION:

18

Well, I'm still trying to get at your

19

position.

20

the same argument here today?

21

There are interrogatories

Suppose it had been raised, would you not be making

MR. POLLAK:

I would be making that argument but I

22

would also be strengthened with the detail of the type of aid

23

which the University received.

24

Mr. Justice —

25

QUESTION:

I am not in that position,

I know, Mr. Poliak, but are we to assume
26

1

that $31 million, whether or not it supports this particular

2

program, satisfies 504, or are we to assume that $31 million,

3

because it's not otherwise litigated, includes funds, federal

4

funds, to support this program?

5

MR. POLLAK:

Which is it?

My position is that the program to which

Mr. Camenisch by the record has been admitted is the Univer­

7

sity program, and the University program receives $31.4

QUESTION:

9

Well, then, you're saying without identi­

11

receives $31 million satisfies the requirement of the statute,

QUESTION:

Well, does it show that any of the

$31 million is sort of a block grant to the University to do

MR. POLLAK:

statement that the University of Texas at Austin receives
federal financial assistance in excess of $31.4 million.
QUESTION:

Well, that might be all, technically,

logically, it could be for, all $31 million is allocated to

13

another single program within the University.

Yes, sir.
What premise are we to proceed on?

That

20

the $31 million satisfies 504 whether or not it supports this

21

particular program?

22

MR. POLLAK:

I urge the Court to proceed on the

23

premise that that requirement is satisfied, but I urge the

say to the Court that this case is before you to decide, and

that we cannot come to you with all of the permutations and

comparable to the language of Title VI, and HEW's reading of

MR. BUSCEMI: My answer to that question, Mr. Justice

Powell, is that financial need is not a relevant criterion

under the regulation.

Right.

That's my second question.

But

14

the first one, I don't think it's made clear in the assign­

4

which they're challenging it, the question presented, if I

5

understand the petition correctly, is not whether financial

6

need is an appropriate factor, but only whether Section 504

7

requires the expenditure of any money at all.

QUESTION:

So I don't want — I mean, they're

Well, if the question's here, the Govern­

ment's position is that financial need is irrelevant?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Under this regulation; that is true.

11

We have not taken a position, Mr. Justice Powell, whether a

12

regulation — that should this regulation be changed, for

13

example, to make financial need a relevant criterion, whe­

14

ther such a regulation would or would not be consistent with

15

the statute.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Do you really think the Congress of the

United States intended financial need
MR. BUSCEMI:

to be irrelevant?

I think the Congress of the United

19

States intended to give to funding agencies the power to

20

promulgate rules and regulations to implement the antidiscrimi

21

nation, the antiexclusion guarantees of Section 504.

22

QUESTION:

And without regard to the federal funds

23

provided, and without regard to the financial need of the

24

individual that claimed this help?

25

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, certainly not without regard to
35

1

the federal funds provided, because as I said at the very

2

beginning, if there were no federal funds provided --

5

QUESTION:

Well, I suggested $31,000 instead of

$31 million.
MR. BUSCEMI:

If there was $31,000 provided, the

6

University would of course make a decision as to whether

7

that amount of aid was sufficient to justify the imposition

8

of the requirements of the statute.

9

well conclude that it would rather do without.

Texas is like $31,000 to most schools?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Mr. Justice Marshall, as I understand

16

the record, it indicates that the $31 million is approximately

17

one-sixth to one-seventh of the University of Texas's

18

annual budget.

19

QUESTION:

What if the record showed a million-doi-

20

lar grant to the Medical School, and this student is not part

21

of the Medical School — a $1 million grant to conduct re­

22

search on cancer.

Then does that invoke the provisions of

Government's position that part of that $31 million must go

directly, for example, to a professor who has taught

Program or activity has to be defined in a somewhat broader

14

way.

15

contends, it should cover the entire University, the minute any

federal funds are received, or whether it should be restrictec ,

17

for example, to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, or

18

to an undergraduate program, is not before the Court and

Now, how broad it should be, whether as respondent

There has never been any consideration of what the

should have to show that the money went to a program or

is in a better position to, you know, prove that question

That's right.

And how about the question of mootness

The respondent has graduated and got his degree ,

MR. BUSCEMI:

I would think, Mr. Justice Stewart,

22

that there is a substantial question, and I think this is

6

If it were shown on this record that this man had $100,000

with enforcing the statute require.

has given to the adminsitrative agencies a broad delegation

That would be a possible argument,

Act.

It's only now that they say nothing at all. But they argued

That's one of the things we've pointed out in our brief

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LONNY F. ZWIENER, ESO.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL

MR. ZWIENER:

The program-specific situation was

That's

Now --

Well, this case is the case we have

before us.
MR. ZWIENER:

And in this case, to summarize, Your

Honor, we would say that 504 requires the universities to do
46

1

nothing; not, certainly not to spend money.
With respect to Lau, Lau was not decided under the

2
3

Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment, but was under Title VI

and in that case there was no question of program specific;

5

everybody assumed that the school district got substantial

Now, I would say that Lau was probably

I would decide it differently because I would say

not to "discriminate."
This case isn’t brought under the

Constitution either, though.
MR. ZWIENER:

15

20

well, that's all we're required to do; they can have a chance

21

to come out.

22

I say that Lau may be wrongly decided from the viewpoint I'm

23

advancing here, that unless you tie a direction to the states

24

or to private industry not to discriminate against the

25

handicapped to money, then there is no federal power to

That cer-

tainly addresses the question.

MR. ZWIENER:

Addresses?

Yes, sir.

It says, very

simply, that a recipient will not discriminate against the
