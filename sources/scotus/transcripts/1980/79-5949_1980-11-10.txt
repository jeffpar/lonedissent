ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR., ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HEFT:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue brought before the Court today in these

10
11

consolidated cases is whether or not constitutional due process

12

of law requires a hearing outside the presence of the jury to

13

determine the admissibility of -- identification evidence.
We submit that the issue before this Court is not

14

15

the narrow one concerning the admission of identification

16

evidence, but rather the issue, and the essence of that issue

17

goes to effective assistance of counsel.

18

the practical application of the issue because it has a direct

19

effect on the practice of criminal law in cases throughout this

20

country.

21

the necessity for requiring an in camera hearing is so intri­

22

cately interwoven to effective assistance of counsel, that due

23
24

25

The Court must examine

The Petitioners will demonstrate to the Court that

process requires an in camera hearing.
QUESTION:

This is as to the admissibility of any

identification evidence?

1

MR. HEFT:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. HEFT:

That's correct, Justice Stewart.

4

QUESTION:

What you're saying is that cross-examina­

5

6

Yes, be it a show-up, line-up, or -Or a proposed identification in Court?
The --

tion is not sufficient?
MR. HEFT:

Exactly.

We feel that, this Court has

7

examined in its history, numerous cases involving identifica­

8

tion testimony.

9

bert, were concerned with the

10
1 1

Those cases,

to-wit, Wade, Stovall and Gil­
suggestive identification

procedures that may be implemented.
The more recent decisions, specifically the Biggers

12

and the Manson decisions, deal with the reliability of the

13

identification evidence.

14

The emphasis has, in fact, shifted.

The present stand of the Manson standard, which

15

requires that the reliability of identification evidence be

16

weighed against the corrupting effect of suggestive identifi­

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

cation procedures, requires an evidentiary hearing to determine
how that procedure is going to be implemented.
QUESTION:

The first three cases you mentioned had

to do with; the first two with a line-up and the third one with
a show-up, so-called?
MR. HEFT:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

And the second cases, category of cases

you mentioned, had to do with identification in court?
MR. HEFT:

Well Biggers, when the -- I believe when

25

5

1

the test shifted to Biggers, there was a show-up conducted in
2

the Biggers case and the Court determined, rather than to
3

rely only on the -- the only test was that various factors
4

had to be determined
5

6
7

8

QUESTION:

I haven’t read it recently, was how much of an opportunity did
the victim of the rape in that case have to, actually have to
identify the defendant, isn't that it?

9

10
1 1

The question in Biggers, as I remember it,

MR. HEFT:

Exactly.

The Court recognized that a

show-up is a suggestive procedure, per se.

But the real

question in the Biggers case was, could the witness, notwith­

12

standing any suggestive identification procedures, could the

13

witness give an accurate and reliable identification.

14

QUESTION:

In Court?

15

MR. HEFT:

Yes.

16

QUESTION:

There was not a line-up in Biggers, was

MR. HEFT:

No, just the show-up.

17

18

there ?
The question

19

becomes how does due process require the Manson analysis to

20

be implemented.

21

along this line.

22

And we submit there are several considerations

First of all, as the Respondent argues here, that

23

discovery is an adequate method by which to implement the

24

Manson analysis.

25

quate; primarily because the purpose of discovery is only to

We submit that discovery is totally inade­

6

1

2

disclose what possible evidence may exist.

do with the resolution of issues of constitutional magnitude.

3
4

5

6
7

It has nothing to

More importantly there is no due process right to
discovery.

Discovery is necessarily a matter of state pro­

cedural law.

Consequently, it's -- what is discoverable today

may not be discoverable tomorrow.
In fact, Kentucky at the present time is going

8

through a revision of its discovery rules. And we feel for

9

those reasons

10
11

discovery is constitutionally inadequate to

achieve a reliable identification.
The respondent also argues that the defense attorney

12

has equal access to pretrial interviews of witnesses and that

13

this will satisfy any constitutional requirements --

14

QUESTION:

Counsel, did you make and preserve this

15

right to counsel argument as opposed to the Wade, Stovall,

16

Denno argument all through the Kentucky courts into the

17

District Court in the Sixth Circuit?

18

MR. HEFT:

Justice Rehnquist, I don't think anyone

19

ever questioned the individual's right to counsel.

We are not

20

saying that the individual is entitled to counsel in pre-

21

critical stages; that's not the issue.

22

in Watkins' case, Watkins was identified in a line-up and a

23

show-up before his indictment.

24

a right to counsel at those points in time, all we're saying

25

in this brief, is that counsel did have the right to an

We assume, for example

We're not saying that he had

7

in camera, hearing to challenge the reliability --

4

QUESTION:

fication was offered by the prosecution, did you then at that
time ask for a hearing outside the presence of the jury?

5

6

MR. HEFT:

In Watkins' case, there was a pretrial

motion filed to suppress.

7

8

You mean that when the in-court identi­

That isn't what I asked you.

Now, you

objected at the -- in trial, did you?

9

MR. HEFT: That's correct.

10

QUESTION:

And did you ask at the time when the

1 1

trial was going on for a hearing outside the presence of the

12

jury?

13

MR. HEFT:

Pretrial.

The judge called the case

14

for trial, both attorneys asked for in camera hearings.

15

attorneys in the Watkins and the Summitt cases cited Wade,

16

Stovall and Gilbert and constitutional principles, to justify

17

the request for the hearings.

18

QUESTION:

19

Both

You still haven't answered Justice

Rehnquist's --

20

QUESTION:

Did they cite Jackson against Denno, or --

21

MR. HEFT:

No.

22

QUESTION:

So that you didn't raise the point in the

23
24

25

No one cited Jackson v. Denno.

state court?
MR. HEFT:

It was raised and it was considered by,

particularly, the Sixth Circuit.

1

2
3

QUESTION:

can't consider a point that wasn't raised and considered in
the state courts, can they?

4

5

Well, but the Sixth Circuit on a habeas

MR. HEFT:

The state courts

did not specifically

address the Jackson issue.

6

QUESTION:

Because you hadn't raised it?

7

MR. HEFT:

It had been -- Jackson had not been,

8

specifically raised.

9

QUESTION:

Well why did the federal habeas court

10

think that you had exhausted your state remedies on this par­

1 1

ticular question?

12

MR. HEFT:

Well the Kentucky Supreme Court just

13

found, in both of these cases, that there was no due process

14

right.

15

QUESTION:

To what, to what?

16

MR. HEFT:

To have the in camera hearing before eye

17

witness identification could be admitted.
QUESTION:

Well, so you did raise it in the state

20

MR. HEFT:

That specific issue was raised.

21

QUESTION:

Yes, but was it -- on the grounds of

18
19

court?

22

what?

23

hearing?

24

25

Why did you think you were entitled to an in camera

MR. HEFT:

Due process.

Because the attorney on

cross-examination cannot adequately challenge the reliability
9

1

of identification.
2

QUESTION:

Well Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked you if

3

you had presented that issue in the state courts?
4

MR. HEFT:
5

6

raised specifically in Jackson v. Denno terms in the state
court.

7

10

It had been raised -QUESTION:

Well I don't care whether you -- it isn't

so much whether you cited Jackson against Denno, but it's
whether or not you claimed that the federal constitution as
a matter of due process --

1 1

12
13

Well Justice White, it had not been

MR. HEFT:

Yes, it was claimed --

QUESTION:

-- requires you to -- requires an in

camera hearing.

14

MR. HEFT:

Yes sir, it was.

15

QUESTION:

You've now embellished it with this,

Due process grounds --

16

it's really a right to counsel, due process argument, is that

17

it?

18
19

MR. HEFT:

It has certain ramifications for effective

assistance of counsel, that's our position.

20

QUESTION:

Well the evidence was admitted, wasn't it?

21

MR. HEFT:

Yes sir.

22

QUESTION:

And you don't challenge that it wasn't

23

admissible?

24

right to cross-examination, it might not have been?

25

Or do you say that if counsel had the unrestrained

MR. HEFT:

That's the issue to be determined and
10

1

2
3

that's the value of the in camera hearing.

We don't feel that

an attorney on cross-examination can adequately challenge the
reliability of identification.

There are too many factors the

4

attorney has to consider when he undertakes cross-examination.

5

He's got to understand the nature of the case.

6

Court has to analyze the issue presented here from the per­

7

spective of the trial attorney.

8

going to cross-examine a witness, for example, in the Summitt

9

case, he's going to cross-examine a rape victim who is still

When the trial attorney is

emotionally distraught because of this experience over almost

1 1

two years after the rape itself.

consideration what did the prosecutor achieve on direct

examination.

18

He also has to take into

The Watkins case is a classic example.

The pro­

secution didn't even touch the pretrial identification -QUESTION:

The rule you're advocating would apply,

I take it to, as equally, to six witnesses, identification
witnesses or 12, as it does to one, would it not?

19

MR. HEFT:

Yes.

20

QUESTION:

And it would apply outside the identifi­

21

cation field, I would take it, because a trial attorney has to

22

make that sort of determination you're talking about, how much

23

did the prosecutor accomplish on direct, with respect to every

24

single witness in the case, whether to decline cross-examina­

25

tion, make an extensive cross-examination, or the like?
11

1

. MR. HEFT:

That's true. His -- what we're saying is

that, without this in camera hearing, the attorney is just
in an incredibly untenable position to challenge the reliabil­
ity of the identification.

5

We would submit that, granted it would take time

6

to conduct the evidentiary hearing, pretrial, or out of the

7

presence of the jury, but we would submit that it is judicial

8

economy to conduct that hearing, for several reasons.

9

of all, the attorney is going to -- if, assuming the reliabil­

10

ity is very strong, an in camera hearing may result in settle­

1 1

ment of the case.

12

strong, the attorney, he may waive cross-examination of that

13

witness and certainly, he's going to restrict and limit his

14

cross-examination.

15

type of cross-examination that Summitt's attorney engaged in.

16

Summitt -QUESTION:

17

First

Second of all, if the reliability is so

He's not going to engage in the rambling

So you're saying, in effect, that the

18

Constitution requires that there be this in camera or pretrial

19

exploration so that the attorney can decide whether he wants

20

to cross-examine and if so, how much; isn't that what it adds

21

up to?

It adds up to a question of the effective

what you're asking for?
12

Isn't that

1

MR. HEFT:

Yes.

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Now, if it's a hold-up of a bank, or a

2

supermarket, and you've got 12 witnesses, eyewitnesses, you're
4

going to, on your theory, have to have the in camera examina­

14

15

tion of each one of those witnesses to see how fallible or how
strong their identification may be?
MR. HEFT

That's correct.

QUESTION

Would you extend the same rule to the

testimony of a police officer in a drug case who testifies that
yes, this white substance was a controlled substance?
MR. HEFT

No sir.

I think this particular issue

is restricted only to identification evidence cases.
QUESTION

But what logical ground is there to sep-

arate one from the other?
MR. HEFT:

Well, you would not -- I think, primarily,

16

the constitutional ramifications of suggestive identification

17

procedures and unreliability of identification evidence.

18

your hypothetical, Justice Rehnquist, the matter of whether or

19

not a certain substance may be cocaine or heroin, that -- I

20

don't see any constitutional problems with a denial of an in

fact a controlled substance.

Because the analysis in Jackson went right

Yes, but the jury is not permitted to

MR. HEFT:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

And of identification of it.

MR. HEFT:

They have to determine the reliability

of the evidence, and the reliability is based first of all,

5

on, perhaps, suggestive identification procedures.

6

has to be, whether or not the identification procedure is

7

suggestive has to be determined.

8
9

That's --

We submit that that's a question of law, given the
decisions of this Court along these lines.

After the Court

10

decides whether or not the identification is suggestive, the

n

Court then has to determine whether or not in spite of any

12

suggestive procedures, is the identification reliable and can

13

the jury itself pass on the credibility of the witness and the

14

reliability of that identification.

15

The problem I see, that this Court should take into

16

account, is if we don't have the in camera hearing, what

17

happens when the jury is confronted with the Foster v. Cali­

MR. HEFT:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

That's a much different case from saying

that the evidence is excluded and arguing that instructions
to disregard the evidence is ineffective. That was really the

MR. HEFT:

I think that the analogy that keeps

coming to mind is the Foster v. California situation, where

MR. HEFT:

No, no, I'm only suggesting to the Court

that where you may have to exclude evidence is where there may
be any indication of suggestive identification procedures.

You mean, before court, before trial?

11

MR. HEFT:

As long as, just before the identification

evidence is admitted, whether it is before trial or after the

13

commencement of trial, we would suggest that it be done before

and says tell me what you saw and the witness says I saw that

I think cross-examination would be adequate in

the state has implemented the line-up procedures

of identification procedures, that's where the due process
right attaches.

Certainly.

Do I correctly understand, you're just

to an identification on the ground it was unduly suggestive?
MR. HEFT:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

And it is true, isn't it, most states

allow this kind of pretrial hearing?
MR. HEFT:

Well most, a number of states follow

23

Kentucky's approach, in which the Kentucky Supreme Court said

in both of these cases, this in camera hearing was a preferred

25

course of action.

There are also numerous jurisdictions that

of this case.

We would submit that the dissenting opinion in

QUESTION:

Attorney General Fox, let me change --

just give you a hypothetical.

Supposing you have a post­

indictment line-up identification where there is a clear right
to counsel.

But say there's a dispute of fact as to whether

counsel arrived in the middle of the line-up or before it
started, or something like that, and you had to know the facts
in order to know whether the right, which admittedly would
exist, had been preserved.

Under Kentucky practice, would you

have that put in the line-up testimony and then during the

10

trial decide the question of fact, or would you have a pretrial

11

suppression hearing?

12

MR. FOX:

Normally there would be a motion to

13

suppress, based on those grounds; there would be conduct of

14

a hearing to determine that particular issue.

15

there would be --

that the man looked like he was around 30; and the man was

MR. FOX:

That could be a factor.
Well that was Watkins.
That was Watkins, however, Watkins was

identified in Court without any reference to the pretrial.

The victim was -- identified, and there was no pretrial iden­

MR. FOX:
QUESTION:

Oh yes, Your Honor.
And therefore, you may not use that

evidence, that identification evidence at trial?
MR. FOX:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

In fact

-- well, it's not before the Court, so I won't mention a par­

ticular factual situation.

that I'm aware of, that prosecutor, defense counsel and trial

Needless to say, in one instance

judge beforehand said, hey, this is all we've got, we'll put
it before the jury and if I -- the judge said, if I rule

10

admissible, it will go to the jury; if I rule it inadmissible,

11

I'll move for a mistrial.

12

and direct a verdict of acquittal.

13

QUESTION:

I'll entertain a motion for mistrial

Do I understand you to say that in Ken­

14

tucky practice, there is always a pretrial motion available

15

to suppress

16

either

MR. FOX:

identification or other evidence?
Yes, Your Honor.

The motion to suppress

17

is basically a routine motion filed if there is evidence which

18

has been seized, either a Fourth Amendment right or identifi­

19

cation procedure.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Does your practice require giving a list

of witnesses to the defense in advance of the trial?
MR. FOX:

Witnesses are available.

On our pretrial

discovery motion, scientific evidence, statements of witnesses

24

are not available from the state.

25

names are available.

Witnesses are available,

QUESTION:

17
18
19

Well, I would have thought from your answe

to some of the other questions that it was accorded under Kentucky
procedure now.

On a motion to suppress after being furnished

a list of witnesses, can the defense counsel move to suppress
the testimony of one of the witnesses on the grounds that it's
identification testimony?

15
16

And basi­

MR. FOX:

He can move to suppress for any grounds

that he wishes, whether it be identification or witness identi­
fication.

It's just the trial court makes the determination

as to whether it will or will not be.
QUESTION:

Well, does the trial court have to hear

20

whatever the defense counsel has to say at that time, and is

21

it a factual determination?

22

MR. FOX:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FOX:

25

It's the -Will they call witnesses at the hearing?
There can be, it's not required.

Well here it was denied.

MR. FOX:

Both were denied in this particular instance

6

QUESTION:

There was a motion and they said no

hearing.
8

MR. FOX:

The motion was to suppress because there

9

was no attorney present at the photographic ID.

Under, clearly

10

under Ash, he was not entitled.

The motion should have been

11

denied on 'that basis and on that basis alone.

There was no

12

necessity to hold the hearing.
13

Well was there a motion to suppress any

14

in court identification; I thought there was?

QUESTION:

Under Kentucky practice, you would say

18

Jackson, or that we perceive to be the difference in Jackson,

19

is that in Jackson there was a statute which required the jury

20

to determine the voluntariness of a confession.

21

that that could not be, the same jury determined the voluntari­

22

ness as well as the credibility of it, as -- and the guilt and

innocence.

there is no requirement that the jury determine the admissi­

MR. FOX:

QUESTION:

7

MR. FOX:

Yes, Your Honor, -Under Kentucky practice, is that correct?
That is correct. And if it should perhaps

8

get through our system, and on a habeas action, it would

9

probably not get past that stage.

10

QUESTION:

And basically I take it your, or the

11

state's ca.se, is that it is the function of cross-examination

12

to expose the flaws in any testimony, or flaws in the cred­

13

ibility of any witness?

MR. FOX:

Right, credibility is always an issue for

the jury.

The credibility issue as to the identification, the

They came about a year apart and came out of the

QUESTION:

Mr. Fox, suppose in these cases, the --

22

let's say in the Watkins' case, the prosecution witness is

23

about to testify and identify, making an in court identifica­

24

tion and the defense objects and says this is a tainted

25

identification, I'd like a hearing outside the presence of
41

the jury; denied.

Then on cross-examination -- and the in

2

court identification is admitted, with no reference to the
3

-- any out of court identification -- on cross-examination, the
4

out of court identification is brought out, and then the -5

the witness is cross-examined

and then the defense asks the

6

Court to exclude the in court identification on the ground
7

that it was tainted, or impermissive -- unreliable.

And the

8

judge agrees and strikes the testimony and instructs the
9

jury to disregard it.

As defense counsel, I would move for

Do you think the same risk inheres in thig case?
MR. FOX:

Well let me answer that by saying this,

that in your hypothetical there was other identification
evidence which pointed to the defendant.

Setting aside

that which, in your hypo, should not have been admitted, as

So there are a whole range of remedies

to deal with this that have always been available?

Why would you grant judgment

QUESTION:

7

MR. FOX:

8

QUESTION:

9

If he Is moving for a judgment, or

It's just a question of time?
Yes, Your Honor.
Then the motion for new trial simply

says that there was some procedural unfairness or evidence

10

admitted that may not have been reliable, and the defendant

11

ought not to be sentenced on the basis of the first trial,

12

but nonetheless, there was sufficient evidence to go to the

13

jury?

14
15

MR. FOX:

A motion for a new trial is still within

the discretion of the trial court.
QUESTION:

16

But a motion for directed verdict of

17

acquittal says there simply was not enough evidence to persuade

18

a reasonable juror to convict, doesn't it?
MR. FOX:

19

Our motion for directed verdict of acquit­

20

tal must be made before it is given to the jury.

At the close

21

of all evidence.

22

and a verdict of guilty comes back, then the judgment o.v. can

23

be made.

If that is overruled and it goes to the jury

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FOX:

And those are the same standards?
Basically yes, Your Honor.
44

2

QUESTION:

Which is basically the sufficiency of the

evidence?

3

MR. FOX:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And a motion for a new trial would

basically be some error that occurred during the trial, having

6

nothing to do with

7

the sufficiency of the evidence •

8

MR. FOX:

9

QUESTION:

his

ultimate innocence or guilt, or

That is correct, Your Honor.
The judge's motion, if the judge decided

10

at the end of the case, after the verdict, to enter a judgment

11

notwithstanding the verdict, he would do that only if he de­

12

cided that, excluding the challenged evidence as to which he

13

had instructed the jury to disregard, there was no evidence

14

upon which a reasonable jury

15

that would be the process of the judge's thinking, would it

16

not?
MR. FOX:

17

could return a verdict of guilty,

Well, we basically have a standard that

18

where it would clearly not be unreasonable for the jury to

19

reach a verdict of guilty.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. FOX:

22

He'd probably deny it and let it go up on

appeal.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FOX:

25

But if he was in doubt on --

Or order a new trial?
He'd probably still let it go up on appeal,

and let the appellate court, since we have elected
45

judges,

1

would let the appellate court direct that a new trial be
2

granted.
3

QUESTION:

Of course, Mr. Fox, in Jackson against

4

Denno, as I remember it, there was evidence other than the
5

confession, which was sufficient to sustain the verdict, but
6

the court nevertheless held that due process required a separ­
7

ate hearing.

So I guess your real distinction, here isn't it,

8

is that the distinction between the prejudicial effect of a
9

confession where the defendant m effect says I was the man, as
10

opposed to

third party

testimony saying that was the

11

man; one is much more prejudicial than the other.

MR. FOX:

Yes, I think

in fact

we're talking

two separate constitutional rights, and one is the Fifth Amend­
ment right not to incriminate oneself; and the other is the
right to counsel, and the -- you know, in Pinto, it said it's
prudent to hold the hearings.

And I can't but be perfectly

candid with this Court and say it would have been far more
prudent in both of these instances, simply because if they had
held the hearing we would not be here today.

But that still

does not take away the fact that there was no denial of due
process in

these particular cases.

the 1200 photographs in

You look at the evidence,

the rape case, the identification to

the police beforehand, the descriptions.

It's simply and

basically a commonsense approach to the admissibility of
evidence, do you hold separate trials, at what point do we

draw the line?

I can draw the line between the voluntariness

of a confession and the admissibility of identification evi­

Identification evidence.

10

QUESTION:

-- there is no doctrine

pertaining to

MR. FOX:

The standard is basically that which is

13

the fundamental unfairness.

It's the right to, you know, pre­

We're point­
