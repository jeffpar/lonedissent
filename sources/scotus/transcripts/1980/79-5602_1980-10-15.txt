ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN M. GILDEA

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. GILDEA:

7

9

We'll hear arguments next

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The case of Feodor Fedorenko v. United States, which

10

is now before this Court, is an appeal from the 5th Circuit

1 1

Court of Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the District

12

Court for the Southern District of Florida in a denaturaliza­

13

tion proceeding on grounds that the District Court erred in

14

its interpretation of 8 United States Code 1451(a), and because

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23

that court also erred in finding an equitable alternative basis
for its holding in that lower court decision.
Although three challenges were raised by the
Government in its appeal before the 5th Circuit, the 5th Cir­
cuit decision was limited to whether or not the court erred in
its interpretation and application of the second standard in
Chaunt, which comes out of 8 United States Code 1451(a), and
whether that court had no basis for an equitable holding,
which it did find.
Precedent for this case arises out of the 1969

24

Supreme Court decision of Chaunt v. United States.
25

3

In that

1

case the Supreme Court was asked to interpret the meaning of

2

the materiality standard as imposed by the statute.

3

District Court, in following the precedent, and the Supreme

4

Court's determination of what was a materiality question, held

5

that the Government in the lower court failed to prove by

6

clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the peti­

7

tioner's visa was illegally procured by material misrepresenta­

8

tion under 8 U.S.C. 1451(a).

The

9

The Court of Appeals disagreed with the lower court

10

as to its meaning of Chaunt, and held that the Government did

1 1

in fact meet its burden of proof under the second materiality

12

standard as set forth in Chaunt.

13

with the District Court in its finding

14

Government had not met its burden in the first materiality

15

standard test.

16

The Court of Appeals agreed
in holding that the

The Court of Appeals also disagreed with the District

17

Court in that there was no precedent for the District Court

18

to hold that it could consider equitable grounds as an alterna­

19

tive holding in its case.

20
21

22
23
24

The Court of Appeals then reversed

and remanded the appeal back to the District Court.
QUESTION:

Counsel, just as a matter of practical

information, if Mr. Fedorenko loses this appeal or this review,
what happens to him?

Is he deportable?

MR. GILDEA: .Your Honor, if his citizenship is- taken
away, he would be subject to further proceedings under the

25

4

1

Deportation Section of the Immigration and Naturalization Act,

2

which would require further proceedings.

3

his citizenship at this juncture, if the Supreme Court so holds

4

that the appellate court was correct.

5

He just simply loses

By way of background, the petitioner in this action,

6

Mr. Feodor Fedorenko, was born in 1907 in Sivasch, Ukraine,

7

subject of the USSR, and received a third-grade education.

8

In 1941 he was mobilized into the Russian army along with his

9

truck and while serving in the Russian army, his group was

10

overrun by the German forces --

QUESTION:

MR. GILDEA:

Within three weeks of his induction?
That's correct, Your Honor. -- and taken

13

prisoner by the Germans.

14

five different camps, which are cited in the brief.

15

those camps he was starved, he was beaten, and he was forced

16

to work or die.

17

a guard and was given a uniform, boots, and trained to operate

18

and handle a weapon.

19

the Treblinka Camp, where he serveed involuntarily as a guard

20

for 10 months.

Subsequently he was transported to

He was then trained at Travnicki to serve as

That was a rifle.

He was then sent to

After the uprising in Treblinka in August,

1943, he was assigned back to Travnicki, then to Poelitz,
and then to Hamburg, all while under the control of the German
army.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gildea, just so I can follow this cor­

rectly, are you telling us what the District Court found or
5

1

what your client testified to?

2

As I understand it, there is some controversy about the facts.

3

MR. GILDEA:

Are these undisputed facts?

These are facts that I'm stating to the

4

Court are not only the testimony of my client but the finding

5

of the lower court that he did in fact serve involuntarily and

6

that he did, in fact, go to these various camps.

QUESTION:

8

MR. GILDEA:

Why is that relevant now, here?
Your Honor, it's only relevant in the

sense -QUESTION:

The question here is whether

he concealed

relevant information, is it not?
MR. GILDEA:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The reason

13

why I bring this fact out to Your Honors is that in his move­

14

ment he was transferred not only to Treblinka but also to

15

Poelitz? which was a labor camp.

case, as I will get to.

19

20
21

25

That fact was ultimately

And that becomes an important issue in this

When the war ended the petitioner worked for the
British forces until 1949 and thereafter applied for immigra­
tion into the United States through the vice-consular office
in Germany, was accepted, and came to the United States in 1949
From that point on he resided in Waterbury, Connecti­
cut, up until the time of his retirement from his place of
employment and in 1970 he received his naturalization after
6

1

his application filed in 1969, and in 1977 the Government com­

2

menced these proceedings against Mr. Fedorenko, seeking to

3

strip him of his naturalization, claiming that he had made a

4

material misrepresentation in procuring his visa to the United

5

States, that he had committed atrocities at the Treblinka death

6

camp, and that he had been in service in the German army.

7

After a trial which was conducted in part in Water-

8

bury, Connecticut, and then in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the

9

District Court in a 54-page decision rendered judgment for the

10

petitioner.

1 1

Treblinka survivors, who testified at that trial regarding

12

Mr. Fedorenko and his activities at the Treblinka death camp.

13

20

24

The District Court rejected the testimony of

Mr. Fedorenko, in marked contrast to the testimony
of the witnesses who testified who. came over from Israel,
denied all of the allegations and denied all of the testimony
against him with the exception of the fact that he was indeed
a guard in Death Camp No. 1, but only a perimeter guard and
had nothing to do with the actual operation of the gas chambers
The Court also found, in its 54-page decision, that
the petitioner served involuntarily as a guard under a threat
of death, and that his misrepresentations were not material
under either of the tests in Chaunt v. United States.

The

District Court also found an alternative holding for its
decision on equitable grounds.
The Government appealed, claiming

25

7

the District Court

1

erred in rejecting testimony of witnesses,, and in applying the

2

materality standard, and in using equitable considerations as

3

an alternative holding.

4

The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals did not rule on the

5

District Court's rejection of the testimony of the Treblinka

6

witnesses.

7

or not the Government had met its burden of proof as to the

8

second materiality standard and whether the District Court

9

had authority to enter an alternative holding on equitable

It simply ruled only on the grounds as to whether

grounds.

1 1

It was, indeed, critical to the Government's appeal

12

before the 5th Circuit to convince that court that the testi­

13

mony of one Kempton Jenkins established the clear, unequivocal,

14

and convincing standard required by Chaunt.

15

Mr. Jenkins was the only testimony offered by the Government

16

in an attempt to satisfy that standard.

The testimony of

The District Court rejected a substantial portion

17

18

of Mr. Jenkins' testimony because it was circumstantial,

19

inaccurate, and not clear, unequivocal, and convincing to prove

20

21
22
23
24

a material misrepresentation under either of the Chaunt stan­
dards .

As in Chaunt, the Government here was given one fact

and that was the petitioner's presence at Poelitz, which was a
known labor camp.

And that fact should have, according to the

testimony of Mr. Jenkins, triggered an investigation into
Mr. Fedorenko's background.

Either it did not or the

25

8

1

investigation which was conducted did not disqualify the

2

petitioner.

3

The record is unclear as to what specifically hap­

4

pened with Mr. Fedorenko at the time that he filed his petition

5

for visa to the United States in 1949, because the Government

6

did not produce as an essential witness in this case

7

Mr. Ralph G. Clark, the vice consul who processed his visa.

8
9

QUESTION:

Now, as I understand it, Mr. Gildea,

Jenkins was also a vice consul, was he not?

10

MR. GILDEA:

1 1

QUESTION:
a

That is correct, Your Honor.
And he testified, did he not, that a guard

12

who served in

concentration camp was ineligible as a matter

13

of law for a visa, did he not?

14

MR. GILDEA:

15

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
And that's what he testified.

I know that

16

the district judge did not accept -- he testified as an expert,

17

as I recall, wasn't it?

18

made a finding of fact by the district judge.

19

Jenkins' testimony to that effect, would that not be the end

20

21
22
23
24

25

of the case?

And the -- that was not accepted, or
But had it been

Wouldn't that satisfy the first Chaunt test?

MR. GILDEA:

I believe it would.

If I may direct a

comment to your question, Justice Brennan, in reference to that
It should be noted that Mr. Jenkins' testimony with reference
to voluntariness, that is, whether or not Mr. Fedorenko's
service was voluntary, was based upon his opinion from hearsay
9

1

evidence or conversation that he had with other vice consuls 3

2

and because of only a very limited contact with three other

3

guards, whether they were personal contacts or contacts with

4

the other consuls, I'm not sure.

5

ever interview or refuse admittance by way of visa for any

6

guard who served at the Treblinka camp.

7

But he did not at any time

Furthermore, the District Court rejected his inter­

8

pretation of voluntary because to accept his opinion of volun­

9

tary status would mean that those survivors of Treblinka who

10

have found their way to the United States would have been

11

rejected by his standard, because they in some way served at

12

the Treblinka death camp and processed other Jews and Christian s

13

to their death.

14

Now if one accepts the fact that the kapos that

15

were at the Treblinka camp and that the laborers who were

16

forced to perform mechanical tasks in processing these people

17

into the gas chambers, according to Jenkins' standards, com­

18

mitted voluntary acts or acquiesced in the German efforts to

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

annihilate people because of their religion, that is, the Jews;
to annihilate people because of their inferior background, that
is, the Ukrainians, the Poles, the Eastern Europeans; then
they would not be admitted to the United States.

Their service

would have been considered voluntary and not involuntary.
And the District Court felt that involuntary was a very crucial
key to this case, and ruled, after listening to the testimony
10

1

of Hr. Jenkins and after listening to the testimony of all the

2

survivors of Treblinka, and Mr. Fedorenko, that his definition

3

of voluntary should be rejected.

4

QUESTION:

Well, didn't the 5th Circuit hold, though,

5

that, "We have held that the defendant obtained his citizenship

6

by misrepresentation, concealment of his whereabouts during

7

the war years, and his service as a concentration camp guard"?

8

HR. GILDEA:

9

QUESTION:

Excuse me, I'm sorry; I didn't -Didn't the 5th Circuit hold at page 118

10

of the Appendix, "We have held, however, that the defendant

1 1

obtained his citizenship by misrepresentation and concealment

12

of his whereabouts,

13

concentration camp guard"?

14

15
16

17

18

20

21

24

during the war years, and his service as a

MR. GILDEA:

That is correct, Your Honor. That was

the holding of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals but not the
District Court.
QUESTION:
MR. GILDEA:
QUESTION:
MR. GILDEA:

Well, isn't that the only issue here now?
That's correct, Your Honor. The issue -- ■
The concealment.
That's correct.

The concealment.
And the issue is whe­

ther or not the concealment of his whereabouts during World
War II, that is, his presence at the Treblinka concentration
camp, was a fact that would have denied him admission under
either the first or the second test.
Now, the Government claims that the nondisclosed fact,

25

11

1

that is, Treblinka or his presence at Treblinka as a guard

2

would have triggered an investigation resulting in the denial

3

of his visa.

4

This case is distinguishable from the Chaunt case in

5

some minor respects.

And one of the respects I wish to point

6

out is this.

7

that the nondisclosed membership of Mr. Chaunt in the Communist

8

Party was a fact in and of itself that should have denied

9

citizenship, whereas this petitioner's nondisclosed guard duty

In the Chaunt case the Supreme Court had ruled

10

at Treblinka was found by the District Court as nondisquali­

1 1

fying, that that fact in and of itself would not have denied

12

him admission to the United States.

13

Court also considered additional facts to see whether the

14

second test had been satisfied.

15

In Chaunt the Supreme

In Chaunt the Supreme Court considered whether the

16

nondisclosure of an arrest record was a material misrepresen­

17

tation under the second test of Chaunt.

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

It ruled, no, because

the ultimate facts, that is, the cause for the basis for
arrest, although involving convictions of minor crimes, was of
an extremely slight consequence.
The District Court also looked into the background
of Mr. Fedorenko, the petitioner, in this matter, and in the
evidence that was offered by the Government, evidence to estab­
lish those ultimate facts -- that is, his presence at Treblinka,
the voluntariness of his services, and the commission of

25

12

1

atrocities, were ultimate facts that the court ruled upon --

2

worked in favor of the petitioner, and the court concluded that

3

the petitioner had not committed atrocities, had not served

4

voluntarily, and that these facts would not have denied him a

5

visa, and therefore no material misrepresentation had been

6

committed.

7

It is interesting to note that the 5th Circuit Court

8

of Appeals dropped from its decision the essential term that

9

had been contained in the Supreme Court's decision of Chaunt,

10

and that was the term,

11

held in Chaunt that the Government must prove by clear, unequi­

12

vocal, and convincing evidence, that there was a material mis­

13

representation .

14

"unequivocal."

The Supreme Court had

The District Court used the full meaning of Chaunt in

15

its application to the facts in this case, whereas the 5th

16

Circuit Court of Appeals slightly modified the meaning of

17

Chaunt, not only by dropping that term from the standard that

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

25

the Government must establish in its proof, but also modified
some of the words in the Chaunt decision.
The Court of Appeals in its interpretation of Chaunt
said that "the test of Chaunt, including, had the petitioner
disclosed his presence at Treblinka, would have conducted an
inquiry that might have resulted in a denial of a visa."

The

Supreme Court in the last few words of its second standard in
Chaunt did not use the term "might, but used the term "would."

13

1

Thus the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals really dis­

2

agreed with the District Court by saying, the Government need

3

only prove or establish that there is a possibility of an

4

investigation and that possibility --

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Gildea, I fell off the wagon in your

6

last comment.

7

that in the circumstances of this case the Government has

8

failed to show by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence

9

either (1) or (2), that their disclosure might have been

10

useful."

I have Chaunt in front of me.

Did you say that they said it would have been useful?
MR. GILDEA:

1 1

"We only conclude

That is, the 5th Circuit Court of

12

Appeals said that the Government "would have conducted an

13

inquiry that might have resulted in a denial of a visa."

14

in other words, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals creates a bur­

15

den of saying that fact, nondisclosure, absolutely would have

16

caused an investigation.

17

"possibly," it said it would have.
QUESTION:

18
19

MR. GILDEA:
QUESTION:

21

MR. GILDEA:

22

24

25

Instead of saying the term "might" or

That’s a test more favorable to you, isn't

it?

20

23

So,

isn't.

The first half of it is, Your Honor.
Yes.
That»s correct, but the second half

That is, where it says,

it "might have resulted in a

denial of a visa," whereas the Supreme Court -QUESTION:

What's the difference between that, and

14

1

"possibly leading --

2

MR. GILDEA:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. GILDEA:

All right.
-- to the discovery of other facts"?
But the last few'words of the Supreme

5

Court's decision says that it "would have justified denial of

6

citizenship or that the facts would have warranted denial of

7

citizenship."

Those are --

MR. GILDEA:

10

QUESTION:

15
16
17

18
19

20

21
22
23

The Supreme Court commented on --

Well, I'll read (2) again, that "their

disclosure might have been useful."
MR. GILDEA:

13
14

That is from Chaunt, Your Honor, the

second standard in Chaunt.

1 1

12

Yes -- now, that's from what?

Reading on --

Excuse me, Your Honor. . Are you reading

from the first section of Chaunt or from the conclusions of
Chaunt?
QUESTION:

I'm reading from the next to the last para­

graph of the majority opinion.
MR. GILDEA:
the Supreme Court,

All right.

Earlier in the decision of

it also talked in terms of the two standards

of Chaunt and it used this word -- that would be the third page
of its opinion -- and it said, "True facts might have led to
the disclosure of other facts which would justify denial of
citizenship."

And then in its --

QUESTION:

Well then, you're saying that the Court's

24

opinion is somewhat ambiguous.

This is not the first time but

25

15

1

MR. GILDEA:

That apparently has resulted in the

2

choice of words in that decision and because there did seem to

3

be a change in the opinion as you go along, that caused some

4

of the confusion that exists between the District Court’s

5

interpretation and the interpretation given by the 5th Circuit

6

Court of Appeals.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Gildea, let me see if I understand

8

what your interpretation of Chaunt is.

9

you're saying, it is that there might have -- had the fact been

If I understand what

10

disclosed there might have been ah investigation, but the

1 1

Government has the burden of proving that had the investigation

12

been thorough and successful and all the rest, there were facts

13

in existence which would have warranted the denial of citi­

14

zenship,

15

any

16

not have been an investigation; two they may or may not have

17

discovered the facts.

18

rectly, had everything been done properly there were facts to

19

be discovered, which would have warranted the denial of citi­

23
24

But you say,

That's correct.

they would have to prove that..
was

One, there may or may

They had to prove that.
MR. GILDEA:

21

22

so: the "might"’goes to whether thebe would have been

reason

or

That was their burden,

And because,las in Chaunt, what

the purpose for the Supreme Court to

look into Mr. Chaunt's background?
examine his arrest record?

Why;did the Supreme .Court

To determine that those ultimate

25

16

1

2

facts would not have denied him his citizenship.
QUESTION:

And the reason that the proof failed in

3

Chaunt was that when you get to the whole bottom of the story

4

the Government failed to establish any fact which -- he failed

5

to establish membership in the Communist Party, which would

6

have been a fact warranting denial of citizenship.

7

MR. GILDEA:

That would have satisfied the first test

8

but as to the second test, the Government failed to prove that

9

the ultimate fact, that is the basis, the reason for his ar­

10

rests would have led the Government to information about his

1 1

activities and involvement in the Communist Party.

12

13

QUESTION:

And that those activities would have

justified a denial of citizenship.

14

MR. GILDEA:

15

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
I take it then you think a court dealing

16

with a case like this must decide whether or not the facts

17

about your client, if they had

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

been revealed or if an investi­

gation had revealed all the facts, the true facts, the courts
would have to decide whether those facts would warrant the
denial of citizenship.
MR. GILDEA:
QUESTION:

That's correct, sir.
But if you look at it the other way,

Mr. Gildea, if the test is that it would have triggered an
investigation that might have led to the discovery of facts,
whether or not it in fact did, that's all the Government's
17

1

burden is.

That's very different, isn't it, from what you

2

insist on?

You put the "would" at the place I suggested maybe

3

should be read "might."

4

MR. GILDEA:

I feel that the District Court's opin­

5

ion, its interpretation of Chaunt, and the argument that I'm

6

trying to make before this Court, is a middle road argument.

7

I don't feel it's an extreme argument, whereas I think the

8

Government's argument that says --

QUESTION:

You do wind up, that the investigation

10

must uncover facts the Government must prove, that the investi­

1 1

gation would have uncovered facts which would have resulted in

12

the denial of naturalization.

13

MR. GILDEA:

14

QUESTION:

Isn't that your position?

I would think that --

.

Whereas, it's a lesser burden for the

15

Government if all they have to prove is that it would have

16

triggered an investigation that might have led to facts.

MR. GILDEA:
QUESTION:

That's right.
Well, isn't that what the difference

between you and the Government is?
MR. GILDEA:
QUESTION:

I think so.
But pursuing my question, assume you're

right on what the standard is, is it clear that his service
as a guard would not have disqualified him for citizenship as
a matter of law?
MR. GILDEA:

That was the opinion of the District
18

1

Court.

3

QUESTION:

And one which the Court of Appeals didn't

have to reach, I take it?

4

MR. GILDEA:

Well, the Court of Appeals found facts

5

concerning Mr. Jenkins' testimony which were rejected by the

6

District Court.

7

his testimony was entirely supported --

8
9

It read more into his testimony. It felt that

QUESTION:

So did the Court of Appeals find facts

which it decided would have denied him citizenship?

10

MR. GILDEA:

1 1

QUESTION:

12

MR. GILDEA:

That's correct.
Well, then -That was, the Court of Appeals substi­

13

tuted its judgment for that of the District Court, which sat

14

there listening to all the witnesses.
QUESTION:

15

Well, and suppose the Court of Appeals,

16

we accept that, then, then the difference between you and

17

the Government is sort of irrelevant as to what the standard

18

is because the Court of Appeals found some new facts, but it

19

also found that those facts would have denied him citizenship?

20

Is that what they did?
MR. GILDEA:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. GILDEA:

23
24

25

Justice.

No, I don't think so.

I think that --

Well, you just said it was.
Well, maybe I misstated it.

I'm sorry,

In effect — I want to point out that the 5th

Circuit Court of Appeals expressed the same confusion that may
19

1

have resulted in the reading of Chaunt itself, because the 5th

2

Circuit Court of Appeals in its own decision on the same page

3

interposed the terms "might" and "would."
QUESTION:

4

So you -- you're suggesting, then, that

5

the Court of Appeals didn't reach the question of whether the

6

facts as found by them would have?
MR. GILDEA:

7

8

That's correct.

I think the District

Court simply ruled that there was a possibiity -QUESTION:

9

MR. GILDEA:

10

The Court of Appeals.
The Court of Appeals; correct. The Court

1 1

of Appeals ruled that there was a possibility, and certainly

12

that's all the government had to prove, just the possibility.
QUESTION:

13

No, but did it -- it found some facts.

14

Did it say that on these facts, which we think the record

15

reveals, these facts would have resulted in his denial of

16

citizenship?
MR. GILDEA:

17

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

Yes, I think they did come to that con­

clusion .
QUESTION:

When you're talking about something that

would have triggered an investigation 30 years ago or 40 years
ago or 20 years ago and say that the standard is that the
Government must prove that the investigation would have re­
sulted in the denial of naturalization, you're really going way
back into the cases of missing witnesses and difficult informa­
tion to come by, aren't you?

25

20

1

MR. GILDEA:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The burden

is two-fold, the burden of the petitioner not being able to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL BENJAMIN R. CIVILETTI

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CIVILETTI:

14

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Although the facts in this case stretch back ten
years, 35 years, those facts, and the issues presented in the
case, have been relevant throughout that time, are important
today, and I suggest are important for the future.
Over 150,000 people were naturalized in the United
States in 1980 and in the decade between 1970 and 1980 about
1,500,000 people were naturalized.

The question as to fraud

in procurement of citizenship rights, and the process by
which the Government is permitted or allowed to determine that
fraud, and the standard under which

misrepresentations or

concealments are determined to be material are relevant and
25

21

1

important to the underlying facts of this case, of course, but

2

to the entire operation of questions dealing with entry,

3

resident alienship status, and denaturalization as well as

4

deportation.
It is true, as Justice Murphy speaking for the Court

5

6

said, today perhaps more than in 1943 when he stated it in

7

Schneiderman, that "Many regard citizenship of the United

8

States as the highest hope for civilized man."

9

reason we exercise great care in the review, the application,

And for that

10

of the law and the standards by which we are to deprive someone

1 1

of that great privilege.
I wish to discuss and address two points in my

12
13

argument.

14

and derived from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952

15

in Section 1451(a), as applied to either a willful misrepresen­

16

tation or concealment of a material fact,

17

20
21

22
23
24

25

the grounds in this

case on denaturalization was ordered by the 5th Circuit.
And the second point I wish to address will go to

18
19

One, the meaning of materiality as .applied in Chaunt

whether or not the Government in the District Court by clear,
unequivocal and convincing evidence proved even evidence suf­
ficient to meet and satisfactorily meet the first test in
Chaunt.
With regard to the first point, the issue as I see
it before the Court is whether 1451 and materiality applied
to it requires the Government to prove that the facts if known,
22

1

2
3
4

facts which were concealed or misrepresented, if known, war­
ranted denial of citizenship, an ultimate fact or test; or
whether the second and alternative test in Chaunt, which I
refer to as the investigative or investigation test, allows

5

the Government to prove materiality by showing that if the

6

facts, if known, would have been useful in an investigation

7

which might discover grounds or facts warranting denial of

8

citizenship.

9

QUESTION:

General Civiletti, when you say the facts

10

would have been useful, is that the equivalent of meaning that

1 1

they would have triggered an investigation?
MR. CIVILETTI:

12

1 QUESTION:

13

I think so, Your Honor.

But the second half, Mr. Attorney General,

14

is "might", not "would", have discovered fact :'Which would

15

have led to the denial of citizenship.
MR. CIVILETTI:

16

I think that the 'Court stated in

17

Chaunt the second ihvestigative test in two separate, ways which

18

I think,: have the same meaning.

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

It said, early in the opinion,

in the first statement of the test, language to the effect:
the

facts, if known, which would be useful in an investigation

to determine whether or not there were grounds for denial of
citizenship.

In the second part of the test, the second state­

ment, a restatement, I ..think it dropped the "useful" language
and said:

.facts which, if. known, might possibly lead to -- in

An investigation --> lead to the discovery of facts:warranting
23

•

1

denial of an investigation.
I think both statements assume or presume an investi­

2
3

gation, a concealment of facts sufficient that, if known, they

4

would trigger an investigation, and then pose the scope or

5

focus of the investigation to be, in order to be relevant and

6

material, to the eligibility, the possibility, or that might

7

disclose facts, other facts, different from the concealed

8

facts -QUESTION:

9

As I understand the Government's position,

10

it is not that the Government has to prove that the investiga­

1 1

tion would have turned up facts that would have required the

12

denial of citizenship, but rather that it might have required

13

a denial of citizenship after 'an investigation.

Brennan.

That’s exactly right, Justice

The Government feels that the thrust, purpose, and

intent of 1451 is to prevent fraud, to prevent material mis­
representations, to allow the Government to rely on the accu­
racy and truth of the statements, and that therefore if the
concealment thwarts an investigation, that had the facts
revealed it, then the Government has a right to denaturalize
the person if it further shows that within the focus of the
investigation there were facts which might have warranted
denial of citizenship or eligibility.

And that's exactly --

23

QUESTION:

While I have you interrupted, Mr. Attorney

24

General, if Jenkins' testimony had been believed, namely,
25

24

1

that had it been known at the time a visa was applied for that

2

this chap had been a guard at the camp, he would not have been

3

given a visa.

4

Government's position that the first part of the Chaunt test

5

would have been satisfied?

If that had been found as a fact, is it the

6

MR. CIVILETTI:

7

QUESTION:

8

Yes, and I think --

Are you urging here that this Court turn

this case on that testimony?
MR. CIVILETTI:

9

I will urge in my second point that

10

the District Court erred in substituting its judgment as to

11

what would have happened back in 1950 under the application and

12

interpretation of the law then and practice then, as testified

13

to by Jenkins, that a guard at an extermination camp would not

14

have been found to have been eligible under the Displaced Per­

15

sons Act; yes.
QUESTION:

16

Mr. Attorney General, as I listen to your

17

statement of the test for which the Government contends on the

18

second half of Chaunt, I think it is this -- and you tell me if

19

I'm wrong.

20
21

22
23
24

25

The test is whether the falsification by misleading

the examining officer forestalled an investigation which might
have resulted in the defeat of petitioner's application for
naturalization.
MR. CIVILETTI:
QUESTION:

Substantially.

That is the test for which Justice Clark

in dissent in Chaunt contended should apply.
25

And it was his

1

view that the majority squarely rejected that test.

2

MR. CIVILETTI:

I do not think that they rejected

3

the test.

4

the concealed facts of arrest in Chaunt'were so unrelated to

5

the possible discovery of the membership in the Communist

6

Party that they were too remote and too tenuous, even if there

7

had been an investigation and been discovered, to provide

8

any probability that they would have formed a basis for dis­

9

covering facts which would have warranted denial of citizenship

I think that they applied the test in finding that

10

-- particularly

1 1

the bone, the membership in the communist front organization,

12

were revealed in the papers -- and that therefore there was an

13

insufficient proof of the two elements necessary in the second

14

investigative test in Chaunt.

15

proof that there would have been an investigation, since the

16

revelation of the communist front organization participation

17

did not trigger an investigation.

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

in

light

of the fact that facts closer to

One, there was an insufficient

And secondly,,had there been

an investigation, the elements of the facts in the arrest were
insufficient to have been within the scope of the focus of the
investigation to lead the Government into a discovery of the
Communist membership.
QUESTION:

Is it your view that Justice Clark in

dissent and the majority in Chaunt were applying the same test?
MR. CIVILETTI:

No.

I think probably Justice Clark

in the dissent was reading the Chaunt test closely or narrowly
25

26

1

and quarreling with it by restating and reciting the test that

2

he felt was rejected by the second investigative test stated in

3

Chaunt.

4

Douglas of the connection, the relationship between the inves­

5

tigation — the concealed facts and potential ultimate facts --

6

can suggest at all that what was meant by the second investiga­

7

tive test, that the Government had to in effect prove by clear,

8

unequivocal, convincing evidence other, ultimate facts indi­

9

cated a denial of citizenship.

But I don't think that in the discussion by Justice

Because, if that were the case, there's no need for

10
1 1

two tests.

If the Government must prove that there were

12

existent "facts" --

13

QUESTION:

There'd still be a difference because the

14

first test is very simple:

15

result in denial, that's it.

16

are somewhere in the background facts not specifically called

17

for by the application but which might have been discovered,

18

and would have warranted a denial, but there's doubt as to whe­

19

ther they would have been discovered.

20
21

22
23
24

25

if the concealed fact itself would
The second test would be, there

And then the test would

be whether the concealed fact would have triggered investigatic n
which might have led to the discovery of a disqualifying circum­
stance; that's a different test.

Now, I know you don't agree

with it but at least it's a different test than the first test.
MR. CIVILETTI:

Oh, I don't think so.

If the Govern­

ment actually has to prove ultimate disqualifying facts in its
case, what relationship back does it have to concealment?

27

It has

1

none.

2

the test advocated by the petitioner which bears little rela­

3

tionship to concealment --

4

If it can find those facts or develop those facts under

QUESTION:

Is there a statutory authority for denat­

5

uralizing a person on the ground that even though his applica­

6

tion was completely true, there was at the time of the applica­

7

tion a fact in existence which if known would have disqualified

8

him?
MR. CIVILETTI:

10
1 1

I think so; yes.

Well, that was not the basis, in any

event, on which this person was denaturalized.

MR. CIVILETTI:

That's right.

was he not?

MR. CIVILETTI:

But in the statutory language he was

denaturalized, on the grounds that I stated, was he not?

21

24

Deliberate mis­

representation with regard to his birthplace, with regard to

20

That's correct.

Yes, Your Honor, he was.

He was

denaturalized on the grounds of the concealment of material
facts.
28

1

QUESTION: Well, Mr. Attorney General, the Court of

2

Appeals for the 5th Circuit said that "the> evidence before the

3

District Court clearly and convincingly proved that had the

4

defendant disclosed his guard service the American authorities

5

would have conducted an inquiry that might have resulted in

6

denial of a visa."

7

that is consistent^ with the majority in the Chaunt case.

Now, you must believe and must urge that

8

MR. CIVILETTI:

9

QUESTION: Even though Justice Clark suggested that

10
11

12

13

It is perfectly consistent with it --

the majority had rejected a very similar test.
MR. CIVILETTI:

Yes.

Stated in different language

and from a different -- advocating a different standard.
QUESTION:

But in any event this test that the Court

14

of Appeals applied wouldn't require actual proof of facts that

15

would have resulted in denial of citizenship but it would

16

require the Government to prove that they might have found

17

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

25

facts, and the burden of the Court of Appeals argument as I
understand it is that the Government must need some protection
from the disappearance of facts.
MR. CIVILETTI:

Certainly many of these cases, both

this case and many other cases in the field, are cases brought
six, eight, ten, 15, 20 years or more after the operative
facts, particularly if the concealment and misrepresentation
takes place and is not only perpetuated in the naturalization
but takes place at the time of entry or the time of establishin g
29

1

eligibility under Displaced Persons Act or under immigration

2

quotas or other facts.

3

seems to me, and the petitioner or the defrauder permitted the

4

opportunity to benefit to the extent he'would benefit under

5

the petitioner's point of view for 10

6

on his fraud, and then be in no less position than he would

7

have been in had he not committed fraud, since the Government

8

still has this very onerous burden of proof and proper burden

9

of proof, and the petitioner has enjoyed 10 or 20 years of

And the Government can't be denied, it

or 20 or 30 years, based

10

residence and some of citizenship in the United States, and in

1 1

the process has shifted the burden of proving eligibility and

12

establishing eligibility to the Government because the

13

Government bears the full burden in a denaturalization case,

14

of course, to prove by the standard of proof that either there

15

are facts which it establishes, which show denial of citizen­

16

ship, or a material misrepresentation or concealment by facts

17

which, if known, would have triggered an investigation which

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

might have or possibly have shown facts warranting a denial of
citizenship.
The Government must go further than simply say that
there might be facts out there somewhere from which a denial
of citizenship could be gathered.
QUESTION:

The Government must show --

Well, first of all the Government has to

show that there was concealment,
MR. CIVILETTI:

Exactly.
30

doesn't it?

1

QUESTION:

Now, this isn't a case -- and I don't know

2

if there is a statute which says that regardless of how honest

3

the applicant was, if there were in fact circumstances that

4

would have made him ineligible for citizenship he can be de­

5

naturalized.

This is not such a case?

6

MR. CIVILETTI:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. CIVILETTI:

9

ment case.

This is not such a case.

This case is based upon his concealment.
Yes.

This is not an illegal procure­

It is a fraud case, and that's what we're guarding

10

against and protecting against and which we think the statutory

1 1

provisions of 1451(a) call for and require the Government to

12

do.

13

Mr. Attorney General, one other minor

question.

16

Is this a criminal penalty?

17

Under your view of the facts, did the applicant

Is this a crimihal offense?

Yes, he did commit a Crime at the^

18

time he filled out and made his statements, under Oath in 194 9

19

to the. Commissioner of displaced .Persons .

20
21

22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

And is there a statute of limitations on

that offense, do you happen to know?
MR. CIVILETTI:
QUESTION:

I'm certain there must be.

But there's no statute of limitations on

the right to denaturalize?
MR. CIVILETTI:

There is no statute of limitations
31

on the night to denaturalize; that's correct.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, Justice Clark was

not alone in deciding Chaunt, was he?

4

MR. CIVILETTI: No.

5

QUESTION:

I think I'm the only survivor.

6

QUESTION:

But there were three.

7

MR. CIVILETTI:

Let me move to the second point,

8

which is essentially that the lower court found facts and the

9

5th Circuit affirmed those facts without articulating it, which

10

in and of themselves were proved by clear and convincing evi­

11

dence , which would have amounted to or warranted a denial of

12

citizenship.

13

guard service.-- armed guard service, in a hat and shirt and

14

jacket with epaulets and with stripes, with a black tie, with

15
16

17

18
19

And that essentially is the argument, that the

boots, with a pistol, and with a rifle -- was of -- in an
extermination or death camp, as opposed to all other varieties
of camps -- was such conduct that under the Displaced Persons
Act definitions, adopting the International Refugee Organiza­
tion definitions in Appendix 1 of its constitution, that it
amounted to assistance of the enemy in the persecution of a

20

civilian population.
21

Jenkins' testimony was uncontradicted and unequivocal
22

and based on over 5,000 applications, the interviews of many
23

survivors, the exchange of information among other like vice
24

consuls -- and there were some 30 or 40 of them operating in
25

32

1

Europe at the time -- that no death guard, no armed death guard

2

would have been granted eligibility under the Displaced Persons

3

Act by a vice consul.

4

QUESTION:

General Civiletti,' I refer you to page

5

117 of the Appendix which is a part of the 5th Circuit's

6

opinion, and it's difficult for me to tell whether the Govern­

7

ment is arguing that the 5th Circuit found the District Court's

8

findings were clearly erroneous or whether they simply took

9

part of them and rejected another part of them; particularly

10

if you look at that footnote there.

1 1

MR. CIVILETTI:

13

On Jenkins' testimony about what would

have triggered an investigation, on page 117 of the Appendix.

QUESTION:

16

17

18

19

20

21
22
23
24

25

On 117?

At that point --

Because the District Court didn't credit

all of Jenkins'itestimony.
MR. CIVILETTI:

Yes.

The testimony there cited,

the Q S A there cited, related to establishing Jenkins' testi­
mony at the time, establishing that there would have been an
investigation and then further question and answer was:
"And what if the investigation had shown that he had
been a guard at an extermination camp or death camp?"
And the answer then was:
"Displaced person eligibility or a visa would have
been denied."
33

1

The lower court found that part of, expressly found

2

that that part of Jenkins' testimony with regard to the finding

3

that if he had been a guard the process would have been

4

stopped and that there would have been an investigation -- was

5

credible, gave it full weight, found that fact; which satisfies

6

test 2 of Chaunt as far as the Government's proof of clear and

7

convincing evidence.
The District Court went further, though, and found --

8
9

and this is where I think the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals did

10

not alter the finding, it simply found it unnecessary to deter­

1 1

mine.

or misapplication of law by Jenkins, that the testimony of

testimony

come to the conclusion that the application by

Jenkins of the Displaced Persons Act with the fact and the con­
duct and all the relevant evidence and knowledge that he had
as to the nature of the armed guard participation at a death
camp, was -- his conclusion that that was sufficient alone to
deny a visa or eligibility as a displaced person,was incorrect

25

34

1

and not credible or not believable .

2

I suggest that that was at least a mixed question of

3

law and facts; that the evidence was uncontroverted on the

4

point, from Jenkins; that the voluntary testimony, or the testi

5

mony with regard to involuntariness by Fedorenko, was insuffi­

6

cient to establish

Mr. Attorney General, can I ask you a

question about the the first theory.

were concerned with misrepresentation in an application for

13

naturalization, and the question whether it was a fact in exis­

14

Here, as I understand it, we're concerned with a

15

misrepresentation in an application for a visa.

There is no

claim of misrepresentation in the application for naturaliza­
tion, as I understand it.

Oh, sure.

It was part and parcel of

ments in the representations to the immigration officer who
did the interview for the naturalization.

But let me just finish my point.

QUESTION:

Well, he would never have been in a posi­

tion to apply for naturalization.
QUESTION:

Supposing for example that at the time he

applied for a visa they were only issuing visas to college

10

graduates or married persons or something like that, and he

1 1

had concealed his marital status or his educational status, and

12

therefore got a visa; then came over and lived here for 20 or

13

30 years, and then filed the same kind of application for

14

naturalization he did here.

to denaturalize that person?

no modification.
QUESTION:

But It was never revealed.

The same

MR. CIVILETTI:

I think the answer to that question is

the Government feels that fraud conducted at that time, which

ties and relates to the ground for his lawfully being in the

United States for five years -- which is a condition for

naturalization, we can reach back and denaturalize him for that

fraud and that that is the scheme and structure of the statute

QUESTION: So the test in the denaturalization pro­

MR. CIVILETTI:

I think it would relate if you are

MR. CIVILETTI:

-- a precondition to, and one of the

15

criteria for naturalization.

16

naturalization and it would produce a failure warranting a

17

denial of naturalization.

18

Now, that's not this case, because there was a perpetuation of

1949 and 1950 but then on into and through 1969 and 1970.
QUESTION:

Well, I assume that in my case.
