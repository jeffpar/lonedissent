We'll hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is before the Court on a writ or certiorari
to the Court of Appeals for the: 9th Circuit.

That court re­

versed an order of the district court which denied the respon­
dent Mata's habeas corpus petition.

The court further ordered

that on any retrial of the respondent Mata evidence of identi­
fications of him by two eyewitnesses could not- be admitted.
This defendant and his two codefendants —
QUESTION:

You mean evidence, in-court identifica­

tions, or evidence about a pretrial identification?
MR. BRADY:

As I read the opinion, Your Honor, it

18
19

would apply to both.
QUESTION:

Well, which was it?

Was there -- did it

20

exclude in-court identifications here?
21

MR. BRADY:

It is my reading of the opinion that it

22

excluded both identifications, both evidence of in-court iden­
23

tifications and evidence of identifications from a group of
24

photographs.

QUESTION:

At the state trial there was evidence in­

troduced with respect tc the pretrial identifications?
MR. BRADY:

3

That is correct.

This defendant and his

4

two codefendants by the names of David Gallegos and Salvador

5

Vargas were, convicted in a California court of the first-degree

6

murder of a man by the name of Leonard Arias.

7

fendants were members of the "Mexican Mafia"' prison gang.

8

Victim Arias was a member of a rival gang.

9

introduced that these three defendants accepted an assignment

The three de­

There was evidence

10

from the Mexican Mafia hierarchy to kill Mr. Arias because

1 1

Mr. Arias had stabbed another Mexican Mafia member at the

12

California prison at San Quentin.

13

that they armed themselves and that they stated their inten­

14

tion to kill Mr. Arias.
The killing itself occurred at approximately 1:45

15
16

p.m. of the 19th of October, 1972.
QUESTION:

17

MR. BRADY:

18

19

There was further evidence

Where did that take place?
It occurred in one of the inmate dormi­

tories at the California Correctional Institution at Tehachapi.
At the time there was a correctional officer present in this

20

21

dormitory.

He estimated that there were between 30 and 35

inmates there ait the time. Although both the prosecution and
22

the defense interviewed many of these inmates, only three of
23

them would ever admit that they had witnessed the killing.
24

Each of these three, were hesitant to some greater or less
25

4

1

degree to admit that they'd seen anything and hesitant to admit

2

that they were able to identify anyone.

3

The three eyewitnesses who testified at trial were

4

inmates and were residents of this particular dormitory.

5

The first, of them was an inmate by the name of Paul Childress.

6

The; defendant doe;s not now contend that his identification

7

testimony was improperly admitted.

8

tified that he previously knew the defendant and Mr. Gallegos

9

and he was able on the day after the killing to identify them

Indeed, Mr. Childress tes­

10

by name, and to select their pictures, as well as a photograph

1 1

of the third defendant from a group of several hundred pictures

12

shown to him.

13
14

15
16

17

18
19

The other witnesses were inmates by the name of
Rigoberto Almengor and Jay Allen.

Both of them testified that

they were walking with the victim when he was suddenly set upor.
by three men armed with knives who appeared tc have been wait­
ing for him.

Both of them testified that this fatal struggle

took several minutes, perhaps as lcng as four minutes.
Almengor testified that at one point during it he
struggled briefly with the defendant.

He made eye contact

20

with the defendant, the defendant broke; off his attack on the
21

victim and commenced an attack on Mr, Almon^or.

This lasted

22

a short time.

Thereafter' Mr. Almengor backed off from the

23

defendant, they faced each other from a very short distance,
24

Mr. Almengor then turned his attention back tc the victim,
25

5

1

but once again he and Mr.

2

other from a short distance, and at this point Almengor indi­

3

cated that he wanted no part of this struggle that was going

4

on.

5

Mata backed off.

They faced each

Mr. Allen testified that he too struggled briefly

6

with one of the other men but then he backed off a short dis­

7

tance from the struggle and began yelling for help.

8

day of the killing Mr. Almengor was shown several hundred pic­

9

tures of inmates at. the institution.

On the

From these he was able

10

to narrow it down to a group of four of them which he said were,

1 1

simi.lar in appearance to the men

13

than he said there were assailants.

It should be

Mr. Allen, was also inter­

He stated that he did not want to get in­

volved and for this reason he told the prison authorities he
was able to identify no one.

Because of this they showed him

no pictures.
In the next few days after this there is evidence

19

20

he had seen.

in the record that a riot was occurring at the prison and that
the investigation was postponed for a short time because of
this.

Finally, on the 27th of October, approximately eight

days after the killing, the three witnesses were shown a group
of 24 pictures of inmates.

This was People's Exhibit 23, in­

troduced at trial, and it as well as People's Exhibit 24,
25

6

1

which I'll mention in a moment, has been brought before this

2

Court.

Mr.

Childress was able to Identify all three of the

defendants from this initial photo display.

prison authorities to see what they could do a.bout getting some

new pictures for him to view.

He stated that the pictures that he

Mr. Allen saw the same group of

10

pictures that day.

He was able to identify no one.

He too

1 1

commented that he thought new pictures would be helpful.
In a few days following this the prison authorities

12
13

attempted to take new pictures of a number of inmates.

14

those of the three defendants turned out.

15
16

19

20

These three pictures

were placed in a different group of 15 pictures, which is
People's Exhibit 24, which were shown to the witnesses on the
30th of October.

The identifying information on these pic­

tures, the names and the elates the pictures were taken, that
was covered at the time.
Almengor identified all

At this point both Allen and
three of the defendants.

At trial the two of them stated that they were now

21
22

Only

sure when they saw Mr. Vargas in person at trial that he was
not one of the people who attacked the victim.

They remained

23

firm, however, in their identifications of the defendant and

Gallegos.

From this ]act of necessity it proceeded

The lack of necessity was said to

It is our position and our belief

that this Court

has never held that necessity or lack of necessity for use of
a particular procedure is part of the constitutional standard.
Indeed, the Court has rejected

.attempts,

most recently, in

Hanson v. Brathwaite, to have generalities such as this includ­
ed in what is basically a fact-oriented balancing process.
The Court has, in Simmons v. United States, and again in
U.S. v. Ash, declined the opportunity to formulate special
rules in cases where pretrial photographic
procedures have been used.

1

The: Court has, instead, applied what we believe is a

2

consistent standard of due process fairness in all cases

3

involving the use of pretrial identification procedures.

4

It has applied the same standard whether photographic identifi

5

cation procedures were used, whether a live lineup or showup

6

was used, or whether there was a combination of these factors.
I believe that this Court's due process standard fo­

7

8

cuses on two things:

first, the suggested nature of the par­

9

ticular pretrial confrontation involved in the case-,

and,

10

second, the reliability of the identification evidence.

1 1

believe that the Court's consistent treatment of all these

12

situations makes it clear that it believes that due process

13

does not require that a particular procedure be used, or that

14

the use of one procedure as opposed tc another should be.

15

penalized.

Rather, I believe the Court's cases require only

that the. procedure which is actually used not be so unfair as
to deny a defendant due process.
We therefore ask the Court to reject the 9th Cir­
cuit's approach and tc affirm the approach which hats been
adopted by the 5th Circuit and by the majority of the other
courts which have considered the issue.
very briefly stated, is as follows.

And that approach,

First, if the defendant

objects tc the admission of identification evidence, a court
23

should first ask. itself whether the pretrial identification
24

procedures actually used have been so impermissibly suggestive
25

9

1

that they could give rise to a. very substantia]- likelihood of

2

mistaken identifica.tion.

3

The focus here is on the particular identification

4

confrontation and the circumstances surrounding it.

5

may consider, for example, any circumstances tending to suggest

6

that the witness should identify a particular person or not

7

identify a. particular person.

8

stances of the crime, the extent that they have a bearing on

9

the. question of suggestiveness.

10

The Court

It may consider the circum­

If and only if the Court should determine that the

11

pretrial identification procedures used were so impermissibly

12

suggestive that they could give rise to a very substantial

13

likelihood of mistaken identification, does it become necessary

14

to determine whether in fact it it is likely that they had

15
16

17

18
19

20

this effect.

In making this latter determination the focus is

on the reliability of the identification evidence.

It is at

this point that the Court applies the five factors stated in
Neil v. Biggers, and restated in Hanson v.

Brathwaite, and any

other factors bearing on the question of whether the identifi­
cation evidence is reliable.
QUESTION:

Hr. Brady, the procedural history of this

21

case is that there was a trial in the Superior Court, appealed
22

to the Court of Appeal, the judgment of Conviction affirmed,
23

and then federal habeas sought.

With the State Court of Appeal, and also

with the district court.

Did the district court hold a hearing,

MR. BRADY:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is another one

of the reasons which brings us here, our belief that the 9th

Circuit did not apply Section 2254 when it should have.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, what about the pos­

reasons.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BRADY:

It wasn't for the lack of people.
No.

One reason aDpears to be the fact

13

that a riot was going on in the prison at that time.

14

reason appears to be that all of this was occurring in a pri­

15

QUESTION:

They7 denied relief.

They found that --

on a fairly conolusory opinion found although the identifica­
21

tion procedures used were deficient in some respects, nonethe
22

less, taken as a whole, the identification evidence was still
23

reliable and was still properly admitted.
24

QUESTION:

So, by the time this case got to the

25

13

1

9th Circuit Court of Appeals, three courts had held that there

2

had been no miscarriage of justice:

3

the state Court of Appeal, the federal district court, is that

4

right?
MR. BRADY:

5

the state trial court,

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct,

6

although the state trial court was not expressly called on to

7

resolve the issue.
QUESTION:

8
9

And although the federal district court

talked about irregularities, didn't it?

10

MR. BRADY:

Yes, Your Honor.

1 1

QUESTION: But neither the federal district cohrt nor the

12

United States Court of Appeals dealt with your 2254(d) argu­

13

ment at all, did they?
MR. BRADY:

14

MR. BRADY:

16

18
19

No, Your Honor, they did not.

QUESTION: When did you first laise that argument?

15

17

Did they mention it?

The 2254(d) argument was first raised

in the district cornet, in our return.

We stated at that time

that the findings of the State Court of Appeal should be
accorded the presumption of correctness, mandated by 2254.
We said that this was necessary, because since there had been

20

no objection at trial, the trial court was not really called
21

upon to make fact-findings regarding this identification
22

issue.
23

QUESTION:

Did the trial court -- I understand there

24

was no objection to the testimony about the photo
25

iden.tifica.tion procedure.

2

tion to the in-court identification?

3

MR. BRADY:

4

QUESTION:

Is it also true there was no objec­

That is correct, Your Honor.
But you didn't argue as a matter of

5

California procedure that they therefore could not raise this

waived their constitutional objection by failure to object in

8

the trial court?

9

MR.

BRADY:

That they'd

Wei], let me approach this this way.

10

In the United States District Court, we argued that there had

1 1

been a procedural default by this failure to object.

12

13

there was a controlling 9th Circuit case which would hold

precedent which one panel could not overrule another,
QUESTION: And the state Court of Appeal here did
treat the matter on the merits, did it not?

20

MR.

BRADY:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe that --

21

well., it passed on the constitutional validity of the identi­
22

fication procedures but it's our position that by so doing it
23

did not forgive, any procedural default.

California's contem­

24

poraneous objection rule does not preclude a state appellate

court from considering, from discussing a constitutional

2254(d) is of doubtful applicability, isn't it?
MR. BRADY:

17

18

Wei], that is one of the questions in

No, Your Honor, I don't think so.

The

state Court of Appeal here found itself in this rather no-win
situation.

It had on the one hand the not very appetizing

prospect of foreclosing the defendant, from relief solely on
procedural grounds, or on the other hand, if it wanted any
reviewing courts, any federal courts to have the benefit of
its views to find out -QUESTION:

This

is

a

totally

inconclusive dis­

24

cussion, and even if the state Court of Appeal had found the
25

16

1

identification procedures wholly improper and unconstitutional,

2

your present submission is it had no power to reverse the con­

3

viction, and therefore why is 2254(d) applicable at all if

4

this is just an inconclusive, meaningless discussion?

5

MR. BRADY:

Let me say, it had the power to reverse

6

the conviction but not the right.

And T think the Court's

7

treatment of the issue on the merits was not a meaningless

8

discussion. It was meant to inform not only this defendant but

9

anyone else that might be interested in this case, in the

10

future, of what the Court's views on that were, what it be­

11

lieved the appropriate constitutional standard was, the appro­

priate conclusions.

QUESTION:

For this reason I don't believe it was at

Well, then, if that's the case, the proce­

dural waiver of failure, to object is almost meaningless in the
Superior Court.

If the California appellate court has the

right to say, even though there was no objection, we're free to
to treat this on the merits, and we're free to reverse it if
we think it's flagra.nt enough, or if we think i1 does fall
under the federal constitutional ban.
MR. BRADY:

In my previous answer I attempted to make

the distinction between the power to reverse the judgment and
the right to do so.

23

QUESTION:

I don't understand it.

QUESTION:

That seems to me somewhat meaningless,

24

25

frankly, because, when you say it has the power to do it, do

Yes, I believe that is what I mean, that

this is the state Court of Appeal

-- would be

able to reverse it.

But from all this, I don't think that we can neces­

meaningless or worthless or kind of a throwaway sort of a

thing.

14

and I think this Court's previous cases, most notably

15
16
17

18
19

The court I think considered the issue in some detail,

Wainwright v. Sykes, have encouraged the state appellate
courts to deal with issues such as this and to give the
federa.l courts the benefit of their views, the benefit of what
thoughts they might have about any particular state procedures
or state laws that might be applicable he:re.
And I think it's for this reason that the federal

20

courts should,

where a state appellate court has passed on a

21

constitutional issue, give deference to the decision of that
22

stale appellate court.
23

QUESTION:

But that's not because of Wainwright v.

24

Sykes.

That's because of 2254, isn't it?

25

18

1

MR. BRADY:

That's correct.

But in Wainwright v.

2

Sykes, I read that as this Court encouraging the state appel­

3

late courts to tackle these things on the merits and not really

4

to stand on procedural grounds necessarily.

5

QUESTION:

Well, the net result is that your Califor­

6

nia Court of Appeal chose not to follow its own contempora­

7

neous objection rule.

8

MR. BRADY:

QUESTION:

10

MR. BRADY:

Right?
Well, that is -In which case, what are we to do about it?
Well, that is my point.

We don't really

know from, their opinion whether or not they rejected the state

12

contemporaneous objection rule.

to their1 attention in our brief.

It was certainly brought
It's a very well-known point

in California that would not have escaped them.

And I think

the fact that they considered the constitutional claim on its
merits but did not reverse the conviction does not necessarily
mean that they forgave the procedural default.
QUESTION:

Well, they found no error' in the admis­

sion of the identification evidence, which would lead to no
reversal of the conviction.

20

MR. BRADY:

That's correct.

21

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't that mean that they in

22

effect overruled your suggestion that they not even consider
23

the claim because of a failure to object in the trial court,
24

if they considered it on its merits?
25

Thank you.

I do not think you can necessarily imply

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EZRA HENDON, ESQ.,

4

7

BRADY:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think the procedural issues in this case: need not
detain us terribly long.

What we have here is, in the first

10

place, procedural issues brought before this Court

11

not been timely presented in the courts below.

12

13
14

15
16

17

which have

So far as the

record which we have here is concerned, there appears to be
no indication that the argument that the procedural default
bars federal review was ever raised in the: district court.
The only thing that we have is a bare assertion in the reply
brief cf the petitioner that it was orally argued.

There is

no oral transcript of those proceedings in the district court.
I personally did not handle the case in the district court,

18

and so far as I know and so far as the Court is aware -19

QUESTION:

I thought Mr. Brady said it was in a

20

response that they filed.
21

MR. HENDON:

I think what he said was that their

22

2254(d) argument was in the brief which they filed.

The argu­

23

ment that the supposed procedural default bars federal review,
24

so fcir as the: record that is before this Court demonstrates ,
25

20

1

was never raised in the district court.

2

it was raised, if you read their brief carefully, what you

3

conclude is that what was raised was a concession that they

4

are foreclosed from asserting any procedural default argument,

5

and in any event it was never raised in the 9th Circuit.

6

So that the issue is simply not properly before the Court, and

7

even if it were properly before the Court, as I understand the

8

remarks of counsel here this morning, he seems to have indi­

9

cated that, he seems to have agreed that the argument was

In any event, even if

10

presented to the state Court of Appeal, he seems to have con­

1 1

ceded that the state Court of Appeal had the power to reverse

12

the conviction based on the argument on the merits that was

13

presented, and given those two concessions it seems to me very

14

clear that there is simply no federal interest.

interest in comity that is advanced by a federal court in es­

16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

There is no

sence regarding a state court ruling which purports to be on
its merits as a mere gratuity, and that's the language that
counsel uses.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hendon, is there not a federal, in­

terest, even assuming for the moment there were no California
contemporaneous objection rule at all?
didn't waive it?

Not just that they

And supposing a federal judge reviewing the

state record formed the conclusion that as a matter of tidal
tactics the defense counsel decided he would not make any
objection to admissibility of the identification evidence,

25

21

1

because he thought he night have a greater chance of obtaining

2

a not guilty verdict by cross-examining the witnesses at great

3

length and trying to show improper police behavior., and so

4

forth.

5

to reach the right result properly take that trial strategy

6

into account?

Would not the federal court in its interest in trying

MR. HENDON:

7

8

Not as a matter -- it would not bar the

federal court, procedural]y to bar -QUESTION:

9

I understand.

It's not a procedural bar,

10

but should it not be a factor that should be considered in the

11

overall picture of whether due process was denied?
MR. HENDON:

12

On the merits, yes.

I would say that

13

that is -- that if the conclusion is that it weis a tactical

14

decision, then clearly counsel can't get the benefit of both

15

ends of -QUESTION:

16

17

21

22

Well, what is there, in the 'record tc

indicate that it was not a tactical decision

here?

Surely

the objection is one that's well known to trained defense,
lawyers.
MR. HENDON:
issues of this case.

Yes, this is one of the unresolved
It's unresolved because neither 16.wer

court ever reached it, and it is not presented, as I read the
papers here, in this Court, as an alternate ground for rever­

23

sal of the Court' of Appeal by the petitioner.

I don't under­

24

stand them to be. arguing that even if the identification is
25

22

1

bad the Court of Appeal's judgment must be reversed because

2

there was a tactical decision not to object.

5

QUESTION:

But that's not to say that that's not

their 2254(d) argument that you're talking about now, is it?
MR. HENDON:

No; no, that's not their 2254(d).

6

I suppose what this Court -- well, if this Court were, inclined

7

to consider' that matter on its merits, I suppose the appro­

8

priate --- first, the Court, of course, would have to find that

9

the identification was improper, that there is something wrong

10

with the identification.

11

consider that the

QUESTION:

If the Court were then to go on and

No, I'm not sure that that follows.

I'm

suggesting in the analysis of the question v/hether there was
constitutional error committed -MR. HENDON:
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.
By letting this evidence into the record.

It seems to me one could take into consideration the fact that
no objection was made and conceivably that that was a tactical
decision by counsel.

It's hard for me to reach a conclusion

that there's a deprivation of due. process in receiving unob­
jected evidence, evidence to which there was no objection at
all, if the objection was available to counsel.

22

MR, HENDON:

Well, it seems to me that there are

23

twro separate questions.

One is whether the identification is

24

proper or not, and to resolve that question we look to all of
25

23

1

the factors that exist in the case with regard to the identi­

2

fication itself.
QUESTION:

3

Yes, but even if it's improper, no denial

4

cf due process takes place unless it's put into the record of

5

the trial.

6

you wanted.in the police station if the witnesses never tes­

7

tify.

8

The due process issue only arises at trial, as I understand

9

the constitutionality.

You can do everything, all the suggestive material

There can't be any denial of due process from that.

10

MR. HENDON:

1 1

QUESTION:

Yes.
So that it seems to me the critical point

12

is when the evidence is offered.

received, perhaps a denial of due process could take place.

25

24

And that was not

QUESTION:

2

MR. HENDON:

I see.
It was not resolved, in the 9th Circuit

because the 9th Circuit decided that the identification was

6

and is still concerned about the failure to object, then I

suppose an appropriate course would be to remand for further

to object.
Now, with regard to the 2254(d) argument, I think

What I'm suggesting is that if the Court takes the

the federal district court.

It was raised in

It was not raised in the. 9th

Circuit until after the case had been decided.

And I simply

suggest that, this is not -- to reach that question, this
procedural question on its merits, is basically to reward a
kind of off-again-cn-again way of approaching procedural
issues.

18

QUESTION:

Don't you concede the possibility that

19

2254(d) may impose an obligation upon federal courts regardless
20

of whether or not anybody raises the point?
21

MR. HENDON:

That may well be.

That, I don't think

22

--'with all

due respect -- speaks to the question of whether

23

that issue was properly preserved for -24

Well, but if the Court of Appeals didn't

even mention 2254(d)

Yes?
And if 2254(g) does iirvoose some obliga­

4

tion upon federal courts to consider it, and to find an excep­

5

6

exceptions; eight of them, I think -- what does it matter if

7

anybody raised it?

8

10

MR. HENDON:

Well, if this Court is prepared to hold

that in every federal -QUESTION:

Well, do you concede the possibility

1 1

that 2254(d) might impose some obligation upon federal courts,

12

in federal habeas corpus courts?

13
14

15
16

17

18
19

MR. HENDON:
QUESTION:

I suppose so: yes.
And following up Justice Stewart’s ques­

tion, certainly the phraseology makes ' it' virtually. an element
of the federal habeas cause of action, does it not?

That is

it's almost as if it were typical bench trial negligence cau­
sation damages: the plaintiff fails to prove causation, the
defendant doesn't object, and on review would the reviewing
court be prevented from assessing or reviewing what is essen­

20

tially a basic element of the cause of action?
21

MR.. HENDON:

No, I don't think that they vrould be

22

precluded from reaching it.

It has always been my understand­

23

ing, and I’m noi aware of any authority which suggests that
24

there is a sua sponte obligation on the part of the federal
25

26

1

district court or therefore the Court of Appeals to reach that

2

question.

3

if it were to decide that.

4

And I think this Court would be breaking new ground

QUESTION:

Isn't it virtually jurisdictional?

5

I mean, the habeas corpus statute confers a special kind of

6

jurisdiction on federal courts to, in effect, review the same

7

findings that the sta.te courts made and come out differently,

8

if there is a constitutional claim.

9

it's really our obligation as well as counsel's to investigate

10
1 1

12

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

And if it's jurisdictional

whether the jurisdictional requirement was met.
MR. HENDON:

Well, if the conclusion is that it is

jurisdictional, then you are correct.
authority which holds that i1

I am not aware of

is, and I think in any event

it's of no moment here because I don't think we're dealing
truly with conclusions of fact, I don't think these are fact
findings that we're dealing with.

I think we're dealing,

properly understood, with conclusions of law, and I think that
as I read Justice Powell's footnote in Neil v. Riggers, I
think in an extremely similar context he's held as much.
I think that what we're dealing here is not so much with the

20

findings of fact as we are with the conclusions, the constitu­
21

tional conclusions to be drawn from those findings.
22

QUESTION:

Well, what troubled me about Judge

23

Ely's opinion

was

that

there was absolutely no reference to

24

2254(d) in it.

And if you're right, it seems to me he could

25

27

1

have set it aside, set the point to rest in a footnote saying

2

we're dealing here with questions of law and therefore 2254(d)

3

has no force or effect or he dould have dealt'with it in some

4

other way.

5

majority nor the dissent in the 9th Circuit had even any know­

6

ledge of 2254(d).

7

But one got the impression that neither the

MR. HENDON:

Well, with all due respect, Your Honor,

8

I think they had no knowledge of it, and. didn't think of it,

9

because counsel never brought, it to their attention.

Whether

10

it was jurisdictional or not, I think that's the explanation,

1 1

for why it's not addressed.

12
13
14

15
16
17

18
19

If this Court is inclined to go

ahead and treat this procedural issue on its merits, then it
has to essentially substitute itself for the 9th Circuit and
draw its own conclusions.

My point here is that the conclu­

sions which you have to draw are that what the 9th Circuit was
dealing with was conclusions of law, the constitutional signif­
icance of facts.

It was not going ahead and finding any new

facts on its own, and I think that's a fair reading of the
opinion, regardless of whether the 2254(d) issue is addressed
on its face.

20

QUESTION:

You aire suggesting, then, that 22 54

21

just doesn't address itself to mixed questions of fact and lav?';
22

MR. HENDON:

Yes, I am.

23

QUESTION:

It's just purely historical facts that it

24

relates tc?
25

28

MR. HENDON:

1

2

That's right.

Primary historical facts.

I think that's -QUESTION:

3

But you also contend it only applies to

4

determinations by the finder of fact who actually saw the'wit­

5

nesses?

That's a separate question.
MR. HENDON:

6

Yes.

Well, yes, but here you have the

7

wrinkle that there was no objection in the trial court and

8

the argument that's being made by the petitioner is that the

9

finder of fact in that situation is the Court of Appeal.
QUESTION:

10

1 1

12

simply doesn't apply unless there's a determination by a trial
court?
MR. HENDON:

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

But wouldn't you contend that 22.54(d)

Yes.

QUESTION:

I thought you'd made, that argument.

QUESTION:

There was at least an implicit determina­

tion by the trial court when he admitted the evidence, wasn't
there?

Didn't he necessarily, by implication -MR. HENDON:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Find that there was, it was perfectly

proper to admit the evidence, and therefore that the evidence
20

-- it was not unconstitutional to admit the evidence?
21

MR. HENDON:

Yes, but in addressing the question of

22

which primary facts we ought to defer to, which we are not to
23

defer to -24

QUESTION:

There was no discussion, there were no

25

29

1

findings of fact as such.

2
3

MR. HENDON:

There was no discussion, so that's why

it's difficult to identify them..
Now, with regard to the merits, I --- as I understood

4

5

counsel to be speaking this morning -- I find that I have no

6

special objection to the test that's Droposed here, that is

7

we look first to suggestiveness, secondly we look to necessity,

8

and we ask the question with regard to suggestiveness whether

9

these identification procedures could have been suggestive.

10

And with that statement I think what I'd like to do is identify

11

whait I regard to be the issue i.n this case.

12

It seems to me that in Manson v. Bratbwaite and in

13

Neil v. Riggers, this Court made clear that the focus of the

14

inquiry

15

hess

16

17

18

21

the question of whether a given identification is suggestive
and reliable.
QUESTION:

24

You're suggesting then that basically the

9th Circuit and the state Court of Appeal applied the same
legal test for eyewitness identification?
MR. HENDON:

22
23

and reliability, and that the issue that's raised by

this case is what a court may properly consider in passing on

19

20

in eyewitness identification cases is suggestive-

The same as each other, each -- as each

other?
QUESTION:

Yes, that they roughly applied the same

test but reached different results.
25

30

1

MR. HENDON: Yes, I would say that that's --

2

QUESTION:

Well, then, wouldn't you feel that there

3

was some obligation on the Court of Appeals to say that the

4

state Court of Ayjpeal was, that your client had demonstrated b^

5

clear and convincing evidence under 2254(d) that the state

6

Court of Appeal was wrong?
MR. HENDON:

7

I think that the only obligation that

8

the federal court had was to apply the law, the proper Daw,

9

whatever this Court finds it to be, to not substitute its

10

findings of fact for those that already were made, and to draw

1 1

constitutional conclusions from them.

12

conclusion that the federal Court: of Appeals reaches is dif­

13

ferent from the conclusion that the state Court of Appeal

14

15
16

17

reached, then that issue will be resolved here, but I don’t
think they had any independent obligation to apply a different
standard, a clear and convincing evidence standard, if I
understand the thrust of your question.
I think the only obligation was to apply the law

18
19

If the constitutional

and to draw their conclusions from it.
QUESTION:

20

2254(d) then,

How do you read the Subsection 8 of

where it says that,

where a factual issue was

21

determined by the state court, the burden is on the habeas
22

petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it
23

was wrong?
24

MR. HENDON:

Well, it seems to me that that clear

25

31

1

and convincing evidence standard is a part of the already

2

existing legal standard, and that by implicitly, by coming to

3

the conclusion that it came to here, the 9th Circuit has in

4

essence said that.

5

QUEST]ON:

Well, you think that on an appeal, say,

6

within the federal system that doesn't involve federal habeas,

7

that a court of appeals could reverse the admission of identi­

8

fication testimony by a district court only if it found that

9

it was clear and convincingly wrong, rather than just wrong

10

1 1

12

13
14

15
16

17

by a preponderance of the evidence?
MR. HENDON:

You're asking me whether, on a direct

appeal, and in a federal, case?
QUESTION:
MR. HENDON:
Your Honor.

On a direct appeal, yes?
Well, I halve to plead ignorance on that.

I co not practice in federal --

QUESTION:

Well, in a direct appeal of a federal

criminal conviction, a federal reviewing court sets the con­
viction aside if it finds that there was error in the: trial,

18

and I don't know that there's ever been -- it doesn't need to
19

find that beyond a reasonable doubt or by clear and convincing
20

evidence’, it just finds that there was error in the trial,
21

error in the admission of evidence or error in the instruc­
22

tions to the jury, or error somewhere else.
23

MR. HENDON:

I think that's the point that I have

24

been trying to make, or I tried to make at the outset of
25

32

1

Justice Rehnquist's question, that the obligation of the

2

reviewing court is to apply the legal standard that this Court

3

tells it to apply.

4

QUESTION:

Generally there’s no great argument about

5

what happened at the trial because you have the trial record

6

and you know how the judge did instruct the jury, and you know

7

what was admitted in evidence, and so on.

8

HR. HENDON:

9

QUESTION:

You have that here too..
So, if you conclude that that was

10

erroneous, something about it, that it was prejudicial, 'a judg­

1 1

ment of conviction is set aside.

12

MR. HENDON:

You have that here too.

I don't

13

think there's any problem with the record in that regard.

14

This is a fully litigated issue and you have a complete record

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

22

on the eyewitness identification question.
It seems to me that the dispute between the parties
on the merits in this case is essentially whether the Court of
Appeals ought to have been free to consider necessity, the lack
of necessity, and particularly the failure to conduct a lineup.
Now, it seems to me very clear that the court ought to have
been free to do it, and that's precisely what the Court of
Appeals did in this case.
The test that this Court has established in Manson

23

and in Neil is totality of the circumstances.

A court looks

24

to all of the circumstances and so long as it predicates its
25

33

1

findings

on

reliability, so long as it looks to reliability,

2

and so long as reliability is the bottom line, then I read

3

this Court's opinions, especially in Manson and Neil, to con­

4

clude that any circumstance may be considered by a court so

5

long as it goes to reliability.
Now, here in this case you have a witness who is

6
7

essentially saying, I cannot make an identification from photo­

8

graphs, I need to see a lineup.

9

a lineup could not have been conducted.

You also have no reason why
Let's assume, at

10

least, that there is a dispute between the parties on that

1 1

question.

12
13
14

15
16

17

But let's assume, for the moment, that there is no

explanation, there is no valid explanation for why a1lineup
could not be conducted.
And it seems to me very obvious, under those facts,
that the failure to conduct a lineup is a factor going to
reliability.

We all know, and this Court has held, that

lineups are more reliable than photographic identification
where you have a witness saying, I cannot make an identifica­

18

tion from a photograph, it's too old, the photographs are in
19

black and white.

Where you have a witness who's saying that,

20

and saying, I need to have a lineup, then it's perfectly pro­
21

per for a court to consider the failure to conduct a lineup.
22

And I think if you read the petitioner's briefs in this case,
23

you see. that there has been a subtle shift from the opening
24

brief to the closing brief.

What petitioner had been arguing

25

34

1

at the outset and what is essentially the position that, as I

2

read the 5th Circuit cases, has been adopted in the 5th Circuit

3

is that you do not look to the conduct of the police i.n pars­

4

ing on suggestiveness.

5

by itself.

6

look to the photo spread on its face.

What you look to is the photo spread

You don't look beyond the photo spread, and you

Well, that assumes that so long as you have a photo

7

8

spread which is fair on its face, then you never get beyond

9

it end you never get to the second step, which is reliability.

10

And I think a few simple examples ought to demonstrate to the

1 1

Court that that simply cannot be the case.
Let's assume that you have a photo spread which is

12
13
14

15
16

17

fair on its face, but that the police officer is saying to the
witness, this is the person.

Look at photograph number three,

don't you think that looks like him?

Now, I think everybody

would concede that in a circumstance such as that the conduct
cf the police in suggesting a particular identification to a
witness was a factor that properly could be considered in

18

passing on, (a) suggestiveness, and (b) reliability.
19

And I think that's essentially what was done in this
20

case.

I think that you have peculiarity, a peculiar fact

21

situation in this case where you have a witness saying, I
22

cannot make an identification from a photograph, T need to see
23

a lineup.

I think that that's one factor to be considered

24

along with many others that exist in this case that point to
25

35

5

1

a suggestive identification.
You have, for example, the police officers telling

2
3

the witnesses who made identifications --

T think the record

4

will bear out the conclusion that the initial identifications

5

that were made by witness Almengor were positive identifica­

6

tions.

7

Nunez, as the perpetrator of the offense, and the guard said

8

to him, no, no, it can't be Bogus Pete, Bogus Pete wasn't in

9

the prison at the time.

He identified someone by the; name of "Bogus Pe;te"

Now, it seems to me that if what the police are

10
1 1

interested in is simply the identification that the witness

12

presents to them rather than the one that they want to orches­

13

trate, they will not point, out wrong choices.

14

15

this Court has indicated in several of its cases that it will
not do that.
Secondly, they removed a]1 choices that they thought

16

17

18
19

20

And I think

were wrong.

The other witnesses, the other -- Almengor also

pointed out other people who simply magically disappeared from
subsequent showups.
again.

Their photographs just never recurred

I think the record also supports the fact that the

three defendants who Wtere ultimately identified were brought
21

before the holding cell in a very suggestive way so that this
22

also focused the attention of the witnesses on them.

These

23

are all factors which I think the Court of Appeal considered.
24

I think if you read the Court of Appeal's opinion,
25

36

1

it considered all proper factors, it applied an appropriate

2

standard, and it cane to the only conclusion that I think it

3

could have come, which was that you had a very volatile, tense

4

situation, there was an interest in identifying somebody, in

5

getting somebody incarcerated for these -- this offense, and

6

they just picked out the three people that they thought were

7

most conducive to being convicted.

8
9

Now, I think if anything proves the necessity for
a. lineup in this case, nothing does it so much as the fact

10

that after one of the witnesses said, I need to see a lineup,

11

I cannot make identifications in photographs.

This is the

only opportunity that he had to see him live and he said, I
picked out the wrong person.

The guard said, in effect, tell

And he goes to court, and here v^e are today.

21

I think that is palpable proof of the fact that these witnesses
22

indeed needed a lineup, that you could not have a reliable
23

identification in this case without a lineup, and that the
24

Court of Appeals properly considered that, factor in reversing

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Bo you have anything

Brady?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A BRADY, ESQ.,

4

5

Thank you.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -MR. BRADY:

Very briefly.

REBUTTAL

If, to concede at the

moment for purposes of argument that the state Court of
Appeal's opinion was an opinion on the merits of'the constitu­
tional issue, then we submit that that court's findings should
be accorded the presumption of correctness of Section 2254(d).
We raised this point expressly in our return in the district
court, and this appears at page 195 of the Joint Appendix.
In the 9th Circuit we raised the point a little bit
differently.

We were at that point reviewing the findings of

the district court, and we asked the 9th Circuit to accord to
15

the findings of the district court, which as far as we could
16

see had given appropriate deference to the state Court of
17

Appeal's findings, we asked the 9th Circuit to give the dis­
18

trict court's findings deference.

It did not.

19

QUESTION:

Bid the 9th Circuit show a lack of

20

deference to anything other than the ultimate conclusion of the
21

district court?
22

MR.

BRADY:

Yes; yes, Your Honor --

23

QUESTION:

Did they differ on the historical facts?

24

MR. BRADY:

I think they differed on the historical

25

38

1

facts.

2

of Appeal opinion says, in so many words -QUESTION:

3
4

I think two examples will show this.

The state Court

Your colleague doesn't agree with you,

does he, on that?
MR. BRADY:

5

He apparently does not.

The state Court

6

of Appeal says in so many words, there was no influence on

7

the witnesses by the; investigating officers.

8

holds precisely to the contrary.

9

says there was an adequate opportunity for the witnesses to

The 9th Circuit

The state Court of Appeal

10

view the attackers at the time of the attack.

1 1

doesn't so much take that on; it says, the fact that there was

12
13
14

15
16

17

The 9th Circuit

this knife attack going on, this violence, this excitement,
that very likely had the effect of, if you will, taking the
witness's attention away from the men in front of him so that
very likely they did not have an opportunity to view the
attack.
This particular finding seems to be a general pur­
pose; one made up by the 9th Circuit.

It could apjply to any

18

crime of violence. There is nothing in the record here that
19

these witnesses said, we were afraid, or anything of that sort
20

So that I think we really have not an academic exercise here,
21

we have a case where a federal appellate court has very really
22

found that it should be a fact finder in a case where there's
23

been both, a state trial court determination, state appellate
24

court determination, and also a district court determination.
25

39

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Brady, if we agree to the 9th Circuit

2

with respect to the necessity part of its opinion, would we

3

reach this other issue?

4

MR. BRADY:

5

QUEST?ON:

6
7

I think we would, Your Honor.
You don't think the necessity ruling was

dispositive, or independently dispositive?
MR. BRADY:

NO, Your Honor, I do not.

It was one

8

or two strikes against us, but I think even if we were to

9

assume that the 9th Circuit were correct in this, I still do

10

not think we would be over the line into where we would have

1 1

a constitutional violation.

12

stated the appropriate standard better than in the Foster case.

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

It asks, is this the man?

This Court, I think, has never

Has this man been singled out?

Looking at the circumstances here, I think this Court cannot
conclude that.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
The case is submilted.

(Whereupon, at 11:10 o'clock a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
