ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. POLLACK:

Thank you, Your Honor.

May it please

the Court:
I have the privilege of representing First National
Maintenance Corporation in an appeal which comes to you from
the second circuit court.

The question presented for your

determination is whether an employer's unilateral decision to
terminate a losing portion of its operation solely for legiti­
mate business reasons breaches the duty to bargain under Sec­
tion 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act.

15
In this case, Your Honors, we are not dealing with
16
anti-union motivation.

No animus is present.

Nor are we deal­

17
ing with what has been stipulated and accepted as the mandatory
18
nature of effects bargaining.

Nor are we dealing --

19
QUESTION:

Mandatory nature of what?

20

MR. POLLACK:

Effects bargaining, Your Honor.

Nor are

21

we dealing with subjects which may be unlawful under the Borg22

Warner concept.

Stated another way, therefore, Your Honor,

23
we are here to determine whether or not terminating a losing
24
portion of its business for a legitimate business reason is
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

3

1

either a mandatory subject of bargaining within the National

2

Labor Relations Act or a permissive subject of bargaining with­

3

in the National Labor Relations Act.

4
5

QUESTION:

Mr. Pollack, was this a fairly large opera­

tion in New York?
MR. POLLACK:

6

No, Your Honor.

As the record indicates

7

depending upon the time that you look at it, during the criti­

8

cal period the petitioner operated either two or four facili­

9

ties.

10

11
12

We had some 17 months covered by the entire period of

operation in the particular facility which is affected.

Thirty-

five employees were employed in the Greenpark facility which
is the particular facility in which operations were terminated.
QUESTION:

13

Does the record show whether there is much

turnover in this business as far as servicing customers is con­
14

cerned?
15

MR. POLLACK:

No, Your Honor, the record does not

16

show that.

The record does, however, show that there was no

17

interchange between the various facilities serviced by First
18

National.

First National, as Your Honors, I'm sure, are aware,

19

was a service corporation which did cleaning and maintenance
20
work in nursing homes and old age homes within the City of New
21

York.

We have been fortunate in that we have had the benefit

22

of two Supreme Court decisions in this area, one entitled
23

Fibreboard, wherein the Supreme Court had the opportunity of
24

affirming a decision of Mr. Chief Justice Burger who was then
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

4

1

sitting in the circuit court, and in which Mr. Justice Stevens,

2

wrote a concurring.opinion.

3

this Court had an opportunity to examine the case in Darlington.

4

Darlington concerned a partial secession of operations and it

5

arose under Section 3 of the National Labor Relations Act and

6

not under Section 12.

7

Thereafter, about one year later,

I think it can be fairly stated that as we view the

8

decisions of this Court in Fibreboard through its rationale in

9

Darlington as interpreted by the majority of the circuits, and

10

11

even, I might suggest, by the two circuits who came to different
conclusions and by the National Labor Relations Board, which
comes to a different conclusion at face, what seems to me to be

12
13

apparent, that there

evolves a concept of law which is really

what I would suggest is the status of the law today.

And that

14

is to require an employer to bargain about the matter which is
15

within his entrepreneurial control would be in the permissive
16

area as opposed to mandatory.
17

When there are replacements performing the affected
18

work as part of an integrated work process who are still con­
19

trolled by the original employer, then a change in that original
20
work is a mandatory subject of bargaining.

I believe that when

21
Fibreboard talked about subcontracting and subcontracting in
22

terms of the employer still exercising control, and all that the
23

employer did in Fibreboard

was to replace one group of employee s

24

with another group of employees, that's what was meant:
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

5

1

an employer replacing employees performing the affected work as

2

part of the integrated work process, who are still controlled by

3

the employer.

4

would have been mandatory.

5

the work and there are no longer replacements performing that

6

work, or if on the other hand as in Darlington

7

withdraws himself as an employer of the affected work, then in

8

9
10

11

And Fibreboard correctly stated that that subject
However, if there is a secession of

the employer

those instances I would submit the cases almost uniformly hold
that the bargaining would then be permissive.
The hard cases, Your Honors,.where'the courts very
often look to the possibility of taint of union animus, are
really cases where the court is trying in my opinion to look to

12

see whether there is a subterfuge, whether the employer is still
13

becoming the employer, whether the work is really still being
14

done by an ally or where there is really a continuation of the
15

same employment relationship but with different employees.
16

That is not the case which is before you.
17

As I stated, the petitioner

services at best four

18

facilities in the New York area.

It goes into those facilities

19

with its own employees, it cleans the facilities, it receives
20

as compensation from the nursing home a weekly sum which is the
21

equivalent of its out-of-pocket expenses for the payment of
22

its own employees plus a management fee.

In this case the man­

23

agement fee should have been $500 by agreement at the beginning
24

of the arrangement with Greenpark.

It was $250 when the

25
North American Reporting

petitioner requested Greenpark to replace it to the $500.

2

Greenpark refused and the petitioner ceased operations.

QUESTION:

What happened to the employees when the

employer withdrew?
MR. POLLACK:

Your Honor, as part of the effects bar­

10

gaining, there were negotiations and the employees were ulti­

11

mately granted severance pay.

12

it's part of this record, there was talk at least of preferen­

13

tial hire into the other facilities.

QUESTION:

And although I don't know that

But they were not in fact hired in one of

the other three facilities?
MR.

POLLACK:

Your Honor, it is not part of this

record because the effects bargaining was stipulated to at the
lower level and it was acceded ’by all parties that there should
and is mandatory bargaining on the effects, clearly.

And the

reason for that is because we should be looking to the policy
20
of the Act.
21

The policy of the Act, as you know, is set forth in
22

the Act itself.

It talks in terms of its policy.

And it says,

23

in effect, that there is a desire to have collective bargaining,
24

and that the parties should recognize under law each of others,

one another's legitimate rights.

2

The legitimate right of an employee, I submit, is to

3

look to the work which he has traditionally been doing for an

4

employer and say, Mr. Employer, if you continue to do this work,

5

if you continue to be an employer who has control of this work,

6

then I have a legitimate right to want to continue to do it.

7

If you want to take that legitimate right away from me, then at

8

least talk to me about it.

9

right of an employer is to say, like an employee can say,

QUESTION:

Was there a successor employer here?

MR. POLLACK:
QUESTION:

so that, as in First National --

Yes, there was, Your Honor.

Someone to do that job?

18

MR. POLLACK:

Yes, sir, there --

19

QUESTION:

Was there any claim of the employees that

20

they were entitled to -- ?
21

MR. POLLACK:

They did in fact, as the record shows,

22

make a claim on the successor.

The successor was the nursing

23

home who took the operation over by itself and the employees
24

did in fact make a claim on that nursing home.

2

QUESTION:

Was there any privity between the new

employer and the old?
MR. POLLACK:

3

Well, in that, that they had a contract

4

which put the old employer into the business as the nursing home

5

subcontractor; there was that kind of privity, but there is no

6

allegation that there is an alter ego concept as between First

7

National and Greenpark or an unlawful successorship.
QUESTION:

8

MR. POLLACK:

9

QUESTION:

10

11

Let me get at it more directly.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Did First National have anything to do

with the nursing home after they terminated?
MR. POLLACK:

Nothing, Your Honor; nothing.

12

QUESTION:

13

Then there was no privity.

MR. POLLACK:

That was the end of their relationship.

14

QUESTION:

Then there is no privity?

15

MR. POLLACK:

At this point there is no privity; that

16

is certainly correct.

It's been held by many, many of the cir­

17

cuits that employees have a right to quit a job even where an
18

employee cannot strike.

Employees en masse have a right to

19

quit.

So too does an employer in recognition of the entrepre­

20

neurial, core of entrepreneurial control doctrine, have a right
21

to say he does not wish to make that kind of product.

If he

22

totally excludes himself from making the product, I suggest that
23

the dangers inherent in calling this subject a mandatory subject
24

of bargaining, would require that he not be forced into that

6

7

all of which, Your Honors, works to the detriment of the employ­

8

Once a subject is called mandatory, it brings into

That includes the

er's legitimate rights.
In a free enterprise society, as the majority, as the

10

11

Fibreboard decision recognized, even in the majority opinion as
compared to the concurring opinion, there is an inherent manage­
ment freedom.

The concurring opinion called it the core of

12
13

entrepreneurial control.

The National Labor Relations Board in

the Ozark Trailers case, which really is probably the single
14

most important case from the National Labor Relations Board,
15

since it sets the framework within that Board's functions in
16

this area, even there they recognized that to deal with the
17

problem of partial closings

they have to deal with the direct

18

effects of the decision.

I suggest that the direct effect is

1

not an incidental effect of a decision to terminate the manage­
20

ment's desire to stay in business.

It is indirect to the

21

determination made by management in the core of his entrepre­
22

neurial control, to terminate.
23

True, there is no doubt about it, that that decision
24

does affect working conditions, but it affects them indirectly.
25

10

It affects them incidentally.

2

employer should terminate, but what the effects of that termina­

3

tion should be.

4

of partial closing almost on a per se basis as mandatory sub­

5

jects of bargaining, really is a way of saying that they need

to hold a plant hostage in order to have efficient, effective,

the consequences of the closing but that you don't have to bar­

MR. POLLACK:

Indeed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

In fact,

16
we admit we have to bargain over the consequences.

There is no

doubt about that.
18
QUESTION:

Did you state a little while back that you

have bargained over the consequences?

MR. POLLACK:

Yes, Your Honor, that has been done.

It is really not the issue which is before Your Honors, which -22

QUESTION:

No, but what was the result of that bar-

MR. POLLACK:

There was severance pay paid to the

North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

employees.

2

at most, of accumulated seniority, and so there was some

3

severance pay and there was discussion -- although I don't be­

4

lieve it's in the record, because it happens after the record,

5

Your Honor -- there was discussion about preferential hiring

6

in the other facilities.
QUESTION:

7
8

11

MR. POLLACK:

No, Your Honor, because the discussion

concerned itself with preferential hiring in other facilities
operated by the petitioner herein.
QUESTION:

12
13

Well, now, wouldn't the new employer have

to be a party to that bargaining?

9
10

There was some -- the employees had some 17 months,

Oh.

And the other --

And often the successor employer

would have to be a party to the effects bargaining, wouldn't he?
MR. POLLACK:

14

Not necessarily.

It's only if the

effects bargaining was to go to the area of continued employ­
15

ment in the same relationship.

The privity of contract --

16

QUESTION:

Well, no, wouldn't it go beyond that?

17

I mean, if there's a successor employer, don't the employees
18

have a demand upon him under those particular facts?
19

MR. POLLACK:

I think that other -- oh, indeed, Your

20

Honor.

There are other sections of the labor law which clearly

21

show that in a true successorship there is an entitlement of
22

employees to stay in employment.

Certainly --

There's been much in the newspapers about

Ford and Chrysler and others completely shutting down plants

and letting go some several thousands of employees.

instances, I suppose, there,there is bargaining on effects and

6

consequences, but there hasn't been any that I've read about,

MR. POLLACK:

Your Honor, there are -- if I may, we

must be careful not to read into this problem a problem of nor­
mal layoffs.

As you know --

QUESTION:

In those

No, no, I'm talking about -- what I've been

reading is, in Mahwah, New Jersey, for example, Ford has com­
pletely cut out a plant, Stopped operating it entirely.

Laid

14

off some four or five thousand workers.

That's the sort of

15

thing I'm talking about.
16

MR. POLLACK:

Yes.

I would suggest, Your Honor, that

17

if Ford doesn't subcontract out that work to somebody else to do
18

that Ford would have the right to unilaterally make that deci­
19

sion.

That's necessary.

20

QUESTION:

Are you saying that if Ford simultaneously

21

opened a new plant in Hamburg, Germany, employing substantially
22

the same number of people, that that would be a subject of man­
23

datory bargaining?
24

MR. POLLACK:

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe that that is

correct.

Now, they might be able to show in that

would wash out.
18

MR. POLLACK:

Yes, but the question, Your Honor, is

19

whether or not it would be permissive bargaining or mandatory.
20
Because once it becomes mandatory we now get into the whole con­
21

cept of good faith bargaining and it is that, I suggest to you,
22

that an employer who really is going to stop being an employer
23

does -not have to become Involved In.

QUESTION:

Well, in a sense, the word "valid reasons"

3

at the bargaining table doesn't have too much significance,

4

does it?

5

one argument is valid and another isn't?

It's more arguments back and forth rather than saying

MR. POLLACK:

There can be situations where an employer decides

increase productivity to reduce --

QUESTION:

Well, when you say, validly, I mean, it can

MR. POLLACK:

Surely.

8

QUESTION:

Why does the word "valid" creep in?

9

MR. POLLACK:

I think, Your Honor, Mr. Justice

20

Rehnquist, the word "valid"

is whether

there's a valid termina­

2

tion of employment, meaning the employer validly goes out of
22

business.

He doesn't run away and open up a plant in another

23

state- in order to avoid some sort of union problem, or he doesn'

hire a subcontractor in his own plant.

He still reserves the preroga­

I agree that he has the right, however, if he

is going to only do what was done in Fibreboard, subcontract
the work to another labor force, and under those circumstances
he should bargain.

"Bargain," as has been said many, many

times, does not give up the right to make the ultimate decision.
It just means to listen.

I believe he does not have the manda­

17

tory bargaining obligation if he genuinely intends or is forced
18

to cease being an employer.

Therefore, if his supply of raw

19

materials ends, he has the right to do it unilaterally.

If his

major customer says, no more business and he's forced out of

If he's just tired of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13

MR. COME:

14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
15

First of all, I'd like to clear up a few things about
16

the facts in this case.

The petitioner had a maintenance con­

17

tract with the Greenpark Nursing Home.

Under that contract

18

Greenpark paid the labor cost of the petitioner's employees plus
19

back to a $500 weekly fee.

Would that make It different?

Well, had they given them 30 days, it is

conceivable, given the type of monetary problem that petitioner
had, that the union would have been able to bargain over ways
of reducing the labor costs that would have enabled petitioner

15

to remain with the contract.

Because petitioner did not just

16

go out of business.

It remained in business at its other, at

17

the other nursing homes that it was servicing. It was willing to
18

remain in business here, according to the testimony of one of
19

its top officials, if the union could work out the problem, but
20

the point is that at that time there was no time left to nego­
21

tiate, because the petitioner took the position that it was
22

under no duty to bargain with the union about its decision to
23

terminate its operation.

14

MR. COME:

I think that it depends upon the reasons

15

for the decision.

There are some partial closing decisions

16

that turn upon financial or other investment decisions that

bargaining, that there is little that a union could contribute

through the give and takb of the bargaining process.

In those

cases the Board has not required bargaining.

MR. COME:

13
14

Ah --

Well, as I've pointed out to Justice

Brennan, I don't recall such a case, but I am confident, at
least in my reading of the analogous situations, that the
Board would be unlikely to find a bargaining obligation in that

sort of a situation.

But that is poles apart from the situation

that we have here and the situation that we have in many of the

Mr. Come, why is it poles apart?

What is

20

the difference between that case -- maybe the man is a little

older, but still, on the economic decision, he'd rather spend

his money in Florida than where he was.

Florida?

Do you think the Board would say that was a subject

of mandatory bargaining?
MR. COME:

I don't think so.

I don't think so, but

on the other hand, if you have a situation such as you had here,
where the only reasons that this employer wanted to close down

16
were, as he put it, the money items, and the money items were

such that it was not unreasonable to believe that the union

could point out to him ways in which the money problem could

are instances which we have set out in our brief where in the

bargain about the decision in advance, and as a result of that

2

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Come, you may resume.

22

MR. COME:

The heart of this case was illustrated by

23

a question of Justice Brennan's before the example that he gave
24

of the closing of the auto plants.

You have here a situation

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

25

1

where labor cost is the major portion of this contract.

2

matter of fact, there's no capital investment at all and that

3

Greenpark, the nursing home, furnished even the mops and the

4

pails and the materials.

5

As a

Petitioner furnished only labor.

In that sort of a situation the case is very close to

6

Flbreboard because the chances of bargaining, being able to make

7

a difference in the decision to terminate the operation, are

8

sufficiently good to further the statutory purpose of bringing

9

it under the scope of bargaining.

10
11
2
3

5

In Fibreboard the

Court

pointed out that the reasons for the employer's decision to
contract out, that economies could be derived by reducing the
work force, decreasing fringe benefits, and eliminating over­
time payments, involved matters peculiarly suitable for resolu­
tion within the collective bargaining framework.

And the Court

held that in those circumstances the chances were sufficiently
good that bargaining would be able to work out a resolution of

6

the problem, that the statutory purpose would be served by
7

bringing it within the area of mandatory bargaining.
8

QUESTION:

Mr. Come, does it make any difference that

9

in this case the nursing home had agreed to pay all of the labor
20

cost and was obligated to do so?
21

MR. COME:

No, Your --

QUESTION:

That was not the case, of course, In the

24

MR. COME:

That is correct.

But insofar as the

North American Reporting

26

2

paying no more than the total bill.

regardless of what the wages are?
MR. COME:

Well, there was certainly no indication

that that would be the problem.
QUESTION:

They never got to that

Is there any evidence as to what the nurs­

ing home would be willing to do?
MR. COME:

No, the only indication is that, when the

union was told to go to the nursing home about keeping on the
employees, the nursing home said that, we can't do it because
there's a clause in the contract that precludes us from hiring

18

any of the petitioner's employees for 90 days.
19

QUESTION:

Anyway, Mr. Come, even if the nursing home

20

took the position that $250 is our rock bottom dollar, we're
21

not going to contribute any more, you wouldn't have to have them
22

in the negotiation if you could get the union to agree to reduce
23

their wages enough to make up the additional $250, would it?
24

MR. COME:

That is correct.

This is a situation where

25
Nnrth American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

27

1

the total price could be kept where it is if the union were

2

willing to reduce wages or introduce some productivity changes

3

that would make the operation more efficient.

4

fact, earlier in the year, before the union came into the pic­

5

ture, the nursing home had given petitioner a notice that it

6

was going to terminate its contract because a state inspection

7

had found that its employees were not being efficient enough

8

and petitioner instituted some changes in procedures that im­

9

proved efficiency and enabled them to continue the contract.

10

11
12
13
14
15
16
17

As a matter of

ItTs not necessary to guarantee that something like this could
have been achieved.

All that is necessary in order to further

the statutory purpose is to have a situation where, as in
Fibreboard, it is reasonable to believe that something could
be done.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Come, what precisely was the

factual sequence here?

Did the company simply announce without

any previous notice to the union at all that it was shutting
down this operation?

18

MR. COME:

Yes, Your Honor.

Two days before.

And it

19

didn't even announce it to the union.

It announced it to the

20

employees who In turn notified the union.

Now --

21

QUESTION:

Did the contract contain any provision

22

calling for consultation or notice, independent of any other
23

factors here?
24

MR. COME:

No, It did not, because at the time the

North American Reporting

union and the employer.

The contract was between --

12

QUESTION:

But you're making the duty to bargain in

13

effect a part of a contractual provision that was nonexistent.
14

MR. COME:

No, I think you misunderstand me, Your

15

Honor.

What I'm saying is that without a contract there would

16

be a duty to bargain.

Nowever, in negotiating a collective

17

bargaining agreement the parties can in their negotiations
18

define the, or restrict the limits of the bargaining obligation,
19

and there are contract provisions that provide for advance
20

notice,

what sort of bargaining if any has to occur in the

21

event of a termination, what sort of severance pay and things
22

of that sort would be provided?

But we never got to first base

23

on that here.
24

But the logic of petitioner's position that there

is no duty to bargain at all over the decision would remove

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

29

from the mandatory bargaining obligation even the situation at

the stage of contract negotiations where the parties in advance

the law, it's mandatory.
MR. COME:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Or you lose your case, don't you?

MR. COME:

I want to just make one

point and that is that everybody concedes here that there is a

duty to bargain about the effects of a closing.

Now, the ef­

fects of a closing are often intertwined with the decision.

you can't meaningfully bargain about the effects if the

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

22

the Court:
23

If I may just for the record possibly correct what
24

may be some confusion concerning the costs which were applicable

under the contract between First National and the nursing home,

as I said earlier, this was a cost-plus contract which meant any

into this, but in response to the question I would like to.
In the nursing home industry in the State of New York
we are dealing with predominantly a reimbursement state statute
concept under Medicare and Medicaid.

The probability is that

if there were a cost saving in labor, that the state reimburse­
12

ment to the nursing home would be proportionately reduced and so
13

the reason why, I might suggest, the respondent is willing to
14

accept the 2nd Circuit's presumption that they labeled rebut­
15

table, is because in reality it's not.

In this very case it

16

should have been rebutted.

The dissent from it points that out

17
admirably well.
18

QUESTION:

I don't understand that argument.

If the

19

union were to agree to take a cut in wages in order to let your
20

client realize $500 a week, why would that trigger the reimburse
21

ment, New York reimbursement statute?
22

MR. POLLACK:

Because the contract between Greenpark,

23

which was the nursing home, and First National, says that the
24

nursing home repays the out-of-pocket expenses of First National

25

plus a management fee.

2

penses it doesn't help First National.

3

is a critical point that the dissent in the circuit below makes

4

and in reality is why the presumption is really not a rebuttable

5

presumption.

So, if you lower the out-of-pocket ex­
And I believe that that

It's an irrebuttable presumption.

Because, what happened in this very case is the dilem­

And the record itself might not really be com­

And so I suggest to you that the Ozark rule, the pre­

12

sumption of the the 3rd Circuit in Brockway, the presumption of
13

the 2nd Circuit in First National, all become unworkable.
14

Better is it to apply the concurring opinion of Judge Stewart
15

in Fibreboard.
16

QUESTION:

Well, it's a court of appeals opinion --

MR. POLLACK:

Or the court of appeals

opinion

in

18

that very case.

Yes, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

But you're not going to apply my opinion?

20

MR. POLLACK:

I have difficulty, Your Honors.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Pollack, may I ask you a question

22

that Mr. Come's argument raised with me?

If you're correct in

23

your view that this is not a mandatory subject, the decision to
24

close is not, what would your view be about a request by the

union, when you sit down to bargain out a new collective bar­

2

gaining agreement, and they say, we would now like to bargain

3

about the procedure to be put in the contract that shall be

4

followed in the event that the employer faces up to a termina­

5

tion decision.

Would that be mandatory or not?

6

MR. POLLACK:

7

my opinion permissive.

Your Honor, clearly that would be in
However, if the procedure were a proce­

dure which -- wide as it -- which kept at its core the effedts
aspect of bargaining, meaning we want to bargain with you con­
cerning the effects of -QUESTION:

11

No, no, my question is, we want to bargain

with you, we want to have notice of any intent to close and a
12

time to try and tell you how we might help you make a different
13

decision?
14

MR. POLLACK:

Your Honor, I believe the notice re­

15

quirement goes to effects as well as it does to decisional
16

bargaining, and would be proper and mandatory.

I submit that

17

under the reasoning which I advance, the request in advance
18

would be permissive or mandatory only if it were distinguished
19

as between a termination and/or a continuation of the business
20

in a different nature or subject.
21

QUESTION:

No, let's say there's a fact situation just

22

like this, where -23

MR. POLLACK:

It would be permissive, Your Honor, and

24

would certainly be bargainable, but it’s not the kind of subject

that parties can raise to the stature of impact.
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, what do you do with the Telegraphers

case in the railroad?
MR. POLLACK:

4

Your Honor, the Railway Telegraphers

case in my view really concerned the Norris-La Guardia Act and

6

its application in labor disputes as -QUESTION:

Well, it may be, but the Court said it was

No, Your Honor, if I may, the Court said

it was a legal subject for bargaining and therefore it was not
enjoinable.

I don't believe, and I must respectfully suggest,

that that Court was aware or even dealt with -- this Court -even dealt with the Borg-Warner tripartite approach to legal,
mandatory and permissive.

The Court in Telegraph dealt with

legal and illegal.
15

QUESTION:

So you think-'-- my real question was, do

16

you think that the rule might be different in the railroad labor
17

cases?
18

MR. POLLACK:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

So if we happen to disagree with you on

20

how to read the Railway

Telegraphers case, you may lose your

21

case?
22

MR. POLLACK:

If you disagree with me, that would be

23

correct, Your Honor.

But I believe that the way this Court

24

treated Fibreboard and Darlington indicates very clearly that
