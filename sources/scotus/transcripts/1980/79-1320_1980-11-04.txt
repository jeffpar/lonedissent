MR. SCHANTZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:.
Iowa appeals from decisions below, holding that a
nondiscriminatory Iowa statute limiting the length of a twintrailer vehicle to 60 feet unconstitutionally burdens inter­
state commerce.

At stake here, however, appears to be the

authority of the states to regulate vehicle lengths at all.
The Iowa Legislature has determined that the length
of vehicles should be limited in the interest of safety.
Implicit in that determination is a factual premise.
QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, this is your sole

argument here, isn't it, Mr. Schantz?
MR. SCHANTZ:

Safety?

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's

20

the sole interest of the State that is asserted in justifica­
21

tion of the statute.
22

The premise is that safety concerns increase, safety
23

concerns with motor vehicles increase as their length increases.
24

And the central issue here is the proper scope of review by a
25

3

1

federal district court of such a factual determination by.a legis­

2

lature.

3

finding function and inappropriately substituted its judgment

4

for that of the Iowa Legislature.

5

novo determination whether Iowa's 60-foot limitation promotes

6

safety, the federal court should ask only whether, on this

7

record, a reasonable legislature could believe that length

8

limitations promote highway safety.

Iowa submits the District Gourt misperceived its fact­

Rather than making a de

9

Put a little differently, Iowa contends the Court should

10

not have asked, as it plainly did, does this evidence persuade

11

me as a matter of adjudicative fact that a 65-foot twin trailer

12

is significantly less safe than a 60-foot twin trailer, or a

13

55-foot semi?

14

reasonable legislature conclude that the length of vehicles

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

Rather, the Court should have asked, could a

operating on highways should be limited in the interest of
safety?

If so could a legislature then conclude that it's

reasonable to draw a line at 60 feet?
The question then is, what is the question?

And we

think both parties agree that if Iowa's limitation is properly
viewed as a safety measure, Iowa should prevail.

If not pro­

perly viewed as a safety measure, Consolidated Freightways
should prevail.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor, suppose Iowa made a rule

of difference as to whether it was raining or snowing, because
there is a difference?

25

1

HR. SCHANTZ:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.

It doesn't make too much difference how

3

long a truck is in sunny weather, but in rainy weather it does

4

make a difference, doesn't it?

5

MR. SCHANTZ:

We think it does make a difference in

6

sunny weather too, but one of the more critical differences

7

certainly is when the roads are bad, and they are frequently

8

bad in Iowa.

9

QUESTION:

And when visibility is bad.

HR. SCHANTZ:

10

Exactly.

That is one of the principal

1 1

safety concerns here, is with visibility, is with splash and spray

12

that large trucks, long trucks, regardless of their configura­

13

tion.

14

QUESTION:

Do you think then that -- let's take the

15

State of Wyoming or Colorado or some of the states with moun­

16

tains and curved highways and steep, could

Mr. Chief Justice --

I want to keep it within reason.

MR. SCHANTZ:
QUESTION:

I think they could, within reason.

I mean, they couldn't say, no trailer

trucks at all, could they?
MR. SCHANTZ:

No twin-trailer trucks at all?

I don't believe so, in the face of this Court's decision in
5

•

1

the Raymond case, which our interpretation of, is a case that

2

involved discrimination against vehicles with twin-trailers.

3

So we would not say that they could promote, that they could

4

exclude twin-trailer vehicles.

5

rational basis for treating them in any way different.
QUESTION:

6

Indeed, they must have some

What would you say about Iowa's right to

7

fix a 5O-miles-an-hour speed limit when Nebraska and all the

8

contiguous states were 60 miles an hour?
HR. SCHANTZ:

9

10

has that authority.

1 1

QUESTION:

12

We would strenuously argue that Iowa

What if they dropped it down to 20 miles

an hour?
MR. SCHANTZ:

13

Well, with all line-drawing problems,

14

as Justice Holmes, the quote in our brief from Louisville Gas

15

and Electric, at some point it may be that a court should say

16

that it's not —
QUESTION:

17

That would be an undue burden, you would

18

say, on interstate commerce, to say 20 miles an hour is the

19

limit for trucks?
MR. SCHANTZ:

20
21

22
23
24

I would not characterize it that way.

I think the Court might then begin to wonder whether speed was
the basis

--

that a concern for safety based on speed was

truly the basis for that determination.

And if the Court

found that, that would be a different case.
QUESTION:

I don't understand that.

25

6

Supposing the

1

people of the

2

20-mile-an-hour speed limit for everybody in the state, not

3

just trucks, and they enact it through their legislature say­

4

ing, we think that it's pretty clear to us that if nobody goes

5

faster than 20 miles an hour, we'd have fewer deaths on the

6

highways.

state like to drive slowly and they have a

Why couldn't they do that?

7

MR. SCHANTZ:

8

tently, Your Honor 5 they could -QUESTION:

9
10

Well, presumably they would if they had

a 20-mile-an-hour speed limit and everybody obeyed it.
MR. SCHANTZ:

1 1

12

I think if they truly did it consis­

If they had a 20-mile-an-hour speed

limit —
QUESTION:

13

And I don't understand why you can't make

14

the same argument on a 25-foot truck length too.

15

probably safer than 65-foot trucks.
MR. SCHANTZ:

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

They're

I think that's probably correct, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:
truck length?

Well, can't the state just adopt a 25-foot

I don't understand.

MR. SCHANTZ:
QUESTION:

Well, I would be —

It has safety, it certainly has safety

concerns associated with it.
MR. SCHANTZ:

That's correct.

That's correct.

We

would defend that.
QUESTION:

Certainly one reason you might not want

25

7

1

to adopt it is that trucks would in that event avoid Iowa, and

2

Iowa merchants and so forth get profit from trucks of 55-foot

3

length coming through Iowa.

4

QUESTION:

That's a reason why they might not want

5

to do it, but I'm assuming the legislature decides, we'd rather

6

have safety than the business brought to us by 30-foot trucks.
MR. SCHANTZ:

7

That's correct, Your Honor, and I

8

think that reveals an important point about what's going on in

9

this kind of line-drawing.

It is really a question of how

10

much safety at what cost.

11

precise increment that you get from adjusting a line five feet.

SCHANTZ:

I can't address myself to that, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

16
17

that has echoes of the recent "benzene"

case, does it not?

14

15

It may even be hard to identify a

further.

Well, what — let's hear it test it out

Suppose they said, no trucks at all.

Suppose the

Amish took over control of the State, populated the State with
a majority, and the Legislature was overwhelmingly Amish, and
they said, no trucks, just horses and buggies.
safer.

Because they're

They can demonstrate on the record that if you just

have horses and buggies on the highways, you have fewer acci­
dents and fewer deaths.

Is there a point, in other words,

when there is an undue burden, an unreasonable burden on
interstate commerce, independent of whether this helped or

25

8

1

hurt the local merchants?

2

MR. SCHANTZ:

Let me say two things.

First, it's

3

not critical to our case that there be some limit.

4

be prepared to concede that for argument.

5

a fully

6

record shows that the State is truly motivated by safety and

7

that that's a rational concern, that this Court need not in­

8

tervene under undue burdens on commerce grounds.

10

defensible

position,

to

We would

I think, though, it's

say that insofar as the

For one

type decision, how much safety at what cost, and in that -QUESTION:

1 1

Do you really want to add, "at what

12

cost"?

Because I would think it's consistent with your argu­

13

ment to say, as long as they're interested in safety, and

14

that they're entitled to decide how much safety, and that's the

15

end of it.

MR. SCHANTZ:

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Isn't that your judgment?
No, to be clear, I think any safety

regulation could be stricter, or a state could invest more
resources.
QUESTION:
at what cost?

So you think there has to be a cost --

There has to be a balance in it?

MR. SCHANTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, I do.

You mean, in short, the safety, the bur­

dens of the safety — the burdens that safety imposes could be
too much burden?
MR. SCHANTZ:

On the contrary, Your Honor, it is
9

1

just because it is a policy question of how much safety .at

2

what cost, that we believe this Court should leave that ques­

3

tion to a legislature.

4

it terribly wrong, if Iowa were to get it terribly wrong --

5

which it hasn't in this case, we submit -- Congress is there

6

to substitute its judgment on that question of policy.
QUESTION:

7

And in the event that the states get

But Mr. Schantz, before you get to

8

Congress, could the State ever be terribly wrong if it had an

9

expert who was willing to get on the witness stand and say, I

10

think there is a probability that this different regulation

11

will save one human life?
QUESTION:

12
13

I'd certainly be willing to defend that

proposition and I --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SCHANTZ:

16

QUESTION:

24

reasons.

That's right.

That's right.

Are you asking us to overrule the Wisconsin cas e?

MR. SCHANTZ:

17
18

Regardless of the cost impact on commerce':

No, we're not, Your Honor, for two

One is that Iowa did not default in defense of its

length regulation, and I think that the Court's questions
reflect that.

This Court is persuaded that as a general matter1

length is related to safety.

And we think the record supports

the proposition that a legislature could reasonably find that.
QUESTION:

Well, there was a two-week trial in this

case, wasn't there, before Judge Stewart?
MR. SCHANTZ:

Yes,and a very long period of depositions.

25

10

1

Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

Perhaps it's irrelevant, but does the

3

right to travel possibly enter into this total picture?

4

the power of a state legislature go so far that it can impose

5

limits which would be clearly barriers to the right to travel?

6

MR. SCHANTZ:

Does

Well, I think the right to travel

7

cases, primarily, at least, involve the rights of persons to

8

travel and not the right of carriers to transport --

9

QUESTION:

But can a state say, if you want to travel

10

through this state, you have to either walk or ride horseback?

1 1

I think, as I understood it, that was the Chief Justice's

12

question.

13

MR. SCHANTZ:

In principle, as silly as it sounds,

14

I think as a matter of Commerce Clause jurisprudence that is

15

not a bad position.

16

us, now come on, Iowa, you've got to get into the twentieth

17

century, if we tried to do that.

18

QUESTION:

Congress is going to come along and tell

Well, to get to a more current issue,

19

could Iowa ban all trucks which were carrying nuclear waste

20

or hazardous waste from passing through it?

21

22
23
24
25

MR. SCHANTZ:

Not from passing through it, because

I think that would be a direct, probably would be a direct
regulation of interstate commerce, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, but it's a safety.

safety, safety, safety.
11

It would --

1

2

MR. SCHANTZ:

Yes, and I think the state can do a

lot of things that are reasonable to restrict.
QUESTION:

3

Well, I know, but a state here says,

4

instead of saying all nuclear waste trucks stay out, all trucks

5

over 60 feet stay out.

6

MR. SCHANTZ:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SCHANTZ:

That's right, Your Honor.

That's pretty direct, isn't it?
It’s not a barrier in that sense, in

10

I'm afraid it is, that there are no trucks,

11

of that length allowed in the state, no matter what they're

carrying.
MR. SCHANTZ:

But the nuclear waste would not get

I know, but the trucks can't go.

SCHANTZ:

That particular truck can't go through,

and if the limit were raised to 100 feet, Your Honor, that
would still mean that a 108-foot truck can't go through, so I
think we're still basically talking about a question of line­
drawing by the Legislature.
I'd like to return to the question of how Raymond is

QUESTION:

17

Semis beyond that length could

Which was the regulation that applied

to twin trailers or triples or how many ever additional you
added on.

So the Legislature said, if you get a permit from

the DOT, 100 feet is okay.

The DOT then adopted some regula­

tions limiting the use of trailer trains to garbage trucks ,
raw milk, and empty trailers -- empty vehicles in transit, I
believe.

And so it was really because of their configuration
13

1

2

that Wisconsin did not allow those trucks.
Now, the question of length got into it partly be­

3

cause of the way the lawsuit was defended, but it wasn't that

4

statute which was challenged by Consolidated Freightways,

5

of their evidence was comparative safety, between the twin-

6

trailer configuration and the semi-trailer configuration.

7

Most of their burden claim focused on the cost savings, the

8

interlining, the cost of dock handling that would be asso­

9

ciated with the configuration of the vehicle as opposed to

QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor, you're going to comment

and give us your assurance about your border cities exemption?
MR.

SCHANTZ:

Your Honor, the border cities exemptior.

14

-- the border cities provision -- I don't want to quibble about

15

words, but I'm not sure it's an exemption, it's a classifica­

16

tion addressed to what we think is a different situation.

17

QUESTION:

I asked that at this time because of your

18

reference to the Raymond case and its structure.

19

have a structure too of some kind.

MR. SCHANTZ:

And here you

of length provisions, rather than one.

Iowa does have a series
We have one for semis;

at this time it was 55 feet; it's now been increased to 60.
For twin trailers, it was 60 feet; for buses it was 40 feet.
For vehicle carriers it was 65 feet; for livestock carriers

25

14

1

it was for 60 feet.

2

border cities, those border cities which passed a local ordi­

3

nance, they could borrow the limit of the adjacent state.;

4

QUESTION:

And for vehicles going in and out of

Well, counsel, following up on Justice

5

Blackmun's question, Iowa is somewhat peculiarly situated with

6

respect to border cities, isn't it, in that being bounded by

7

the Mississippi on one side and the Missouri on the other, you .

8

have Dubuque, Clinton, Davenport, Keokuk, Fort Madison on the

9

Mississippi side?

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SCHANTZ:

12
13

Council Bluffs.
Council Bluffs on the Missouri side,

yes.
QUESTION:

Sioux City and Council Bluffs on the

14

other, so that a remarkable percentage of the population

15

lives in identifiable border cities.

20

21
22
23
24
25

MR. SCHANTZ:

I don't think the record reflects that

precisely, Your Honor, but that would by no means be a major­
ity of the population of Iowa.

Several of the larger cities --

Des Moines is three times larger than any other city, and it's
pretty much right in the middle.
QUESTION:

Cedar Rapids; Waterloo.

Compared to Wisconsin?

MR. SCHANTZ:

I think more of the population in

Wisconsin is inland; yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, are other kinds of trucks permitted

to exceed this length limit too?
15

1

MR. SCHANTZ:

Yes, it doesn't have anything to do

2

with twins versus semis.

3

and insofar as the record discloses the history of that, it is

4

basically that for many years the length limitations were not

5

enforced.
QUESTION:

6
7

10

The livestock trucks run all over the

state.
MR. SCHANTZ:

8
9

You can run larger livestock carriers

Sixty-foot livestock trucks, which is

the same limitation for twin-trailers. We don't give the live­
stock trailers any special break.
QUESTION:

11

While we're on geography, is it relevant

12

to this case and the problems of the case that Iowa is some­

13

thing of a crossroads in a sense, at least one of the main

14

crossroads for east-west traffic and north-south traffic?
MR. SCHANTZ:

15

From Consolidated Freightways' point

16

of view, frankly, I'm sure it is relevant, just as Pennsylvania

17

being between Boston and New York on interstate highways.
QUESTION:

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Iowa is pretty big to detour if you're

going from Minnesota or Winnipeg down down to New Orleans,
isn't it?
MR. SCHANTZ:

That's a significant -- we would not

suggest that's an insignificant detour.
QUESTION:

But we would suggest --

Would you suggest, perhaps, it just

relates to the pain that they're suffering, not to the constitutional issue?
16

1

MR. SCHANTZ:

Exactly, Your Honor.

Because we don't

2

think that because Georgia is not on a major route between two

3

states that allow longer trucks that they are entitled to have

4

a different rule than Iowa.

5

really, ultimately, the general question of whether the states

6

are going to be free to adopt reasonable length limitations.
QUESTION:

7

8

So we think the Court must address,

Mr. Solicitor, did you argue the case in

the 8th Circuit?
MR. SCHANTZ:

9

QUESTION:

10

No, I did not, Your Honor.

I wonder if you have any, comment about

MR. SCHANTZ:

dubitante

about the full

We think that -- well, perhaps that

didn't completely describe our argument.

We think that the

insight in that dubitante opinion is very much what we are
arguing for.
QUESTION:

And he shouldn't just have been dubitante.

MR. SCHANTZ:

We think it would have justified a

full dissent, Your Honor.

Because I think when we separate

the questions of whether length is generally related to safety,
which was really the kind of question that was addressed in
the Brotherhood case -- and I've also called it the Firemen
case, and I apologize for that -- the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Enginemen and Firemen, the question the Court asked there was,
is the number of people on a crew generally related to the

25

17

1

safety of the operation of the train?

2

clear from the opinion that the Court didn't think it was much

3

related, but they thought that, it could reasonably be thought

4

that it was.

5

should decide whether you had four crew members or five.

6

And a similar point was made in the concurring opinion in Ray

7

MR. SCHANTZ:

MR. SCHANTZ:

we think is wrong, they should review that question of consti­

It seems to me that a reasonable legisla­

They really asked the wrong question;

that's your point?
MR. SCHANTZ:

9

They really asked the wrong question,

10

and if you ask the right question, I think it's clear that a

1 1

legislature could believe length is related to safety.
QUESTION:

12

Well, isn't it also clear that if you ask

13

what you say is the right question the District Court would

14

have come up the other way?

15

he was convinced that the Freightways had shown him convinc­

16

ingly but not overwhelmingly that there was no relation.
MR. SCHANTZ:

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Because the District Court said

That statement, Your Honor, plus the

fact that the District Court called for preemption by Congress.
It

asked

Congress to set a 65-foot limit.

The only rational

grounds, I think, for the Court calling for that is the Court's
belief that on that record, as a general matter, length is re­
lated to safety.

So we think that to focus on five feet is to

slice the salami too thin.
QUESTION:

So, the Court shouldn't be able to ask

if five feet makes any difference?
20

1

MR. SCHANTZ:

Not five feet within a reasonable

2

general range; no, Your Honor.

3

that is our position, and I think that's exactly what -- whe­

4

ther night turns to day at 6 or 6:15, to use Justice Holmes'

5

example, is not a question that a court can find judicially

6

manageable standards to answer.
QUESTION:

7

Maybe I wasn't clear.

I think

Well, are you then saying that when it

8

comes down to slicing it that thin, the phrase you used, then

9

it's for a legislative body, not for a judicial body?
MR. SCHANTZ:

10

Exactly.

Because it is that kind of

1 1

basic choice between a policy choice of values, cost, and

12

safety, that is hard to defend at an intellectual level.

the Court, of course,I -think must find' standards, that can be

Mr. Schantz, I'm still a little troubled

length case and this is a length case.

Well, why in consti­

tutional terms is it different

if the.

I think semis should be regulated in one way and twins in
another?

Why isn't this the same kind of safety judgment?
MR. SCHANTZ:

It is the same kind of safety judgment.

It is the same kind of question.

And I read Raymond to say

that on that record, on that record, a reasonable legislature
could not believe that the configuration of vehicles, that
having a different trailer, two trailers rather than one,

to length.

is the result of drivers going to sleep or otherwise having

if in fact it promotes safety, I think in general, absent

13

reason basically is because under the Commerce Clause you have

a direct conflict between the state government and the interest

of the national government. In that situation you can't turn

to the state and say that the state should be the arbiter of

QUESTION:

Well, I should think Consolidated would

have its own bevy of witnesses that it could produce on these
occasions too, to say that there's no effect on safety.
MR. LEDERER:

That's right.

I think — you know,

first we have the question, of course, the trial court has to
determine the evidence.
QUESTION:

I think, though, that --

Does it try the statute literally?

You

say that's to determine the evidence.
MR. LEDERER:

I think there's a distinction that has

to be made here between two types of statutes.

If you have a

22

situation such as we have in Iowa, in Iowa if the 65-foot twin
23

trailer vehicle, the vehicle itself, is unsafe, then Iowa's
24

regulation promotes safety.

If the 65-foot twin trailer vehic J.e

25

26

1

is safe, then the effect of Iowa's regulation is to cause

2

accidents, injuries, and deaths that need not occur, because

3

Iowa increases the hazard to the interstate traffic by forcing

4

it to go around the State.

Iowa.

MR. LEDERER:

Or having more vehicles on the road

8

in Iowa if, rather than running your twin trailers around the

9

State, you choose to run semis through the State.

In that

10

situation it seems to me that the trial court has to determine

11

what the evidenceis „ whether the regulation does promote safety or

12

does not promote safety. And I distinguish that case from a second

13

case in which you have a regulation by the state which might promote

14

safety but if it's ineffective causes nothing other than eco­

Well, doesn't the Brotherhood case say

that, that the district court has no authority to resolve evi­
dentiary conclusions one way or the other against the judgment
of the legislature?
MR. LEDERER:

22

In that case I think perhaps the courts would

say that.

To an extent the Brotherhood case does

But the Brotherhood case can be distinguished on the

basis that what the Court was addressing was not so much the
question of whether the train crew promoted safety or didn't

how slight, was outweighed by the economic burden.

what could the Legislature believe.

2

this case -- and we have a very curious record, because we had

3

the Governor as a witness for the defense -- the evidence in

this case shows that the Legislature did not believe that the

5

65-foot twin-trailer vehicle was an unsafe vehicle.

6

Legislature in Iowa passed a bill that would permit 65-foot

7

twin-trailers.

Governor stated in his veto message the reasons for the veto.

There is nowhere in that message -- and the Governor stated on

the witness stand that that message stated all of the signifi­

QUESTION:

said, we think we'll be very safe in Iowa if you cut every­

Are you saying that they had a constitu­

MR. LEDERER:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

What I'm saying --

Isn't there a difference between saying

that the difference between 60 and 65 feet is zero, but that
doesn't mean 60 feet has no relevance to safety.
MR. LEDERER:

That's correct.

Sixty feet may well

have a relevance to safety, but what Iowa has shown by its
legislation is that Iowa accepts as a reasonable standard of

25

safety the 55-foot semi-trailer, which is, you know, the most

would assert, and I think, you know, the Governor's veto mes­

5

Iowa Legislature has retained their 60-foot twin-trailer limit,

6

particularly since the border city exemption removes much of

7

the political pressure in the state for 65-foot twins. The re­

8

sult is that Iowa is shifting to other states and to interstate;

9

connerce in general, not only shifting the safety burden, but

10

also increasing it.

11

and that's a longer trip, a significantly longer trip.

12

Because you have to go around the State

The result is, is that there are fewer accidents in

13

Iowa and more accidents on the route around Iowa than there ■

14

would be otherwise, and in fact far more, because the route

around Iowa is largely two-lane highway, whereas the route

16

through Iowa is on 1-80, which is an interstate highway.

QUESTION:

Someone might reasonably argue that the

cure for that is for the other states to copy Iowa.
MR. LEDERER:

Well, it would not so long as you

20

accept the assumption — and it's not an assumption in this

21

case, it's proved -- that the 65-foot twin-trailers are as

22

safe as 55-foot semis.

23

24

25

You have the exact same problem.

Iowa

suggests, why don't we run 55-foot semis through the State?
Aside from the problems in the rest of the system, you'd have
to run more trucks to carry the same amount of cargo,
35

and if you run more trucks through that's going to mean more

accidents.

QUESTION:

Your argument would say that all of the

accept 65-foot twins too since presumably they're as safe in

I think you'd have some problems with the burden on

The burden that Iowa imposes is as large

relationship.

Well, then, you'd really have a stronger

case than the Raymond in Wisconsin, which is not on that

MR. LEDERER:

11

That's correct. Wisconsin was on a

route, but certainly In terms of importance 1-80 is probably

13

a more important route than that through Wisconsin.
QUESTION:

14

Well, suppose Iowa just said, we have too

QUESTION:

Mr. Lederer, your argument based on the

Governor's veto message that the real purpose of the legisla­
tion is to divert traffic around Iowa would support the argu­
ment that there is purposeful discrimination against interstate
commerce, in effect?
MR. LEDERER:

Yes, sir.

I can't remember, did the District Court

make any findings that would establish that?
MR.

nondiscriminatory because it promoted what the District Court

I think the

difference is that there has to be a corollary when you're
dealing with safety.

If what's being promoted at the local

level is safety and all that's being harmed at the national
level is economics, if it's just dollars, I don't think this
Court should then step in and override the State Legislature.

There's quite conclusive proof of that, so

we're not dealing with a case of a regulation which promotes
safety directly.

There's a second level though here.

If

that vehicle is safe, what we're dealing with in terms of
burden is an economic burden, yes.
43

But also a safety burden.

Iowa's legislation makes it more hazardous to conduct inter­
