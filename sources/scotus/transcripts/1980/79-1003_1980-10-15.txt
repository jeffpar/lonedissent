MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. HARMON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HARMON:

9

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether it is permissible,

1 1
12

consistent with principles of res judicata and the Anti-

13

Injunction Act, for the federal court to enjoin enforcement

14

of a ground water exportation restriction in Mr. McDougal's

15

use permit when the California Supreme Court earlier ruled

16

the restriction enforceable.
If I may, before going to the facts of the case,

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

I would like to briefly address the geographical setting for
this case.
In this Court's recent opinion in Bryant v. Yellen,
the Court described the Imperial Valley as an area located
south of the Salton Sea in southeastern California.

It lies

below sea level and is an arid desert in its natural state.
That case, the 160-acre limitation case, dealt with lands in
Imperial County which are within the irrigation district
3

1

boundaries and are irrigated.

2

lies on the West Mesa of Imperial County, an area totally

3

dependent on ground water supplies.

4

Mr. McDougal's parcel, however,

Going to the facts of the case, the California

5

Supreme Court found Mr. McDougal estopped from challenging,

6

and thereby bound by the export restriction in his use permit

7

based on facts which showed that his predecessor, with counsel,

8

agreed to the imposition of the export restriction, abided by

9

it, and benefited from the limited permit as issued.

Further,

10

Mr. McDougal when he purchased the property was aware of the

1 1

restriction.

12

and demanded removal of the export restriction, he was informed

13

that he should make application for a new conditional use per­

14

mit.

15

simply defied the County authorities, entered the subject

16

brokerage contract with respondent Munoz and immediately as

17

many as 44 tank trucks carrying 250,000 gallons a day began

18

export of water to Mexicali, Mexico.

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

When Mr. McDougal went to the County officials

Instead of applying for a use permit, Mr. McDougal

One of the major allegations of the respondent's
complaint is that enforcement of the subject export restriction
will cause economic hardship to them by requiring them to go
eight miles farther north in the County, to the so-called
Clifford well, to buy water for export.

It is alleged that

the price of water is higher at the Clifford well, also in
the County eight miles north.

1

QUESTION:

2
3

MR. HARMON:
Your Honor.

4

5

How far away is Mexicali from this well?
Approximately, I would say, six miles,

The well site --

QUESTION:

So it would be more than twice as far to

the other well?

6

MR. HARMON:

The well is on Highway 98, which kind

7

of parallels the Border, and the Ocotillo well is eight miles

8

north on Highway 98.

9

I believe that the res judicata issue is the major

10

issue in the case.

11

course, rejected the County's argument on res judicata by con­

12

cluding that the McDougal decision is not a final judgment on

13

the merits as to the respondents' cause of action.

14

fundamentally incorrect.
QUESTION:

15
16

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, of

That's

Well, it was an estoppel judgment though,

wasn't it?
MR. HARMON:

17

Yes, it was an estopped judgment, and

18

I've indicated what the facts were substantiated in that

19

estoppel.
QUESTION:

20

21

not Mr. McDougal

22

but his vendees --

should continue to be bound by that judgment

23

MR. HARMON:

24

QUESTION:

25

And your res judicata argument is that

Exactly.
— should also be bound by that estoppel

j udgment.
5

1

MR. HARMON:

Exactly.

And Justice White, I will

2

get to the privity question in a moment, if I may.

3

portantly --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HARMON:

But im­

Well, you have to, I suppose.
Yes, indeed.

Importantly, recognize

6

that the 9th Circuit did not even reach the privity issue.

7

It simply concluded that this is not a final judgment on the

8

merits as to the respondents' action.

9

seems to me.

10

1 1

12

QUESTION:

That can't be true, it

You could say it was true, but still

the estoppel judgment shouldn't stand against these people.
MR. HARMON:

I will get to that.

Importantly, the

13

issue of the enforceability of the export restriction was the

14

central issue in the McDougal case.

15

litigation, finally the California Supreme Court ruled it

16

was enforceable.

After five years of

Indeed, the decision is based on

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. HARMON:

--

Yes, it affirmed the injunction.
Affirmed that portion of the injunction.

19

Now, on the issue of what is a final judgment on the merits,

20

for purposes of res judicata, Professor Moore indicates that

21

a test is where there is a measure of identity so that the

22

different judgment in a second action would destroy or imperil

23

rights or interest

24

Your Honors, the injunction issued by the District Court

25

established by the first judgment.

Here,

robs the California Supreme Court's decision of all of its
6

1

vitality and meaning.

2

Supreme Court concluding that the export restriction is

3

enforceable, now the District Court is telling the County

4

officials that the export restriction must be enjoined.

5

seems to me that it's clear that the focal point made by

6

the 9th Circuit is erroneous and requires reversal.

In one case we've got the California

It

Now, going to the issue of privity, may I again

7

8

remind the Court that the 9th Circuit did not address, did

9

not even reach the issue of privity.

The last page of the

10

Circuit Court of Appeals decision there is a statement that

1 1

indicates that assuming that the respondents are in privity,

12

they would not be bound because of the prior conclusion on the

13

cause of action issue.

14

relationships between McDougal and the respondents which I be­

15

lieve make it clear they should be regarded as being in privity

16

with McDougal.

The record, however, establishes

First of all, there is the contractual relationship

17
18

between respondent Munoz and McDougal.

19

integral part of the McDougal

Munoz has been an

operation since its inception.

20

A verified complaint in the federal action indicates that

21

Munoz is the broker for sale of water to bottling companies in

22
23
24

25

Mexicali.
QUESTION:

Well, don't many courts disagree with

the 9th Circuit's rather limited definition of res judicata
as limited to issues that have been litigated on their merits
7

1

and say that it's any issue that was litigated or might have

2

been litigated?

3

MR. HARMON:

I think that's correct.

Certainly in

4

the reading I've done, the thrust of many writers' opinions

5

is that you're to look at the substance, not just the form of

6

the situation, and if there has been a meaningful relationship

7

between the parties and those who would also be bound by the

8

preclusionary rule, where they've had the opportunity to

9

intervene and litigate the case, they should likewise be

10

bound.
QUESTION:

11

Well, Mr. Harmon, didn't -- weren't

12

those other issues, though, presented in the state litigation?

13

It's just that the state court didn't decide

14

were presented and tendered, and the state court decided the

15

case on estoppel.

^hem.

They

16

MR. HARMON:

17

QUESTION: But isn't estoppel itself a substantive

18

ground?
MR. HARMON:

19

20

23
24

25

Yes, it is.

The leading case there is

Enterprise Irrigation.
QUESTION:

21

22

That's correct.

And the Court of Appeals for the 9th

Circuit said it wasn't.

So -- but that certainly is a fair

issue.
MR. HARMON:

The cases clearly establish that

estoppel is an independent and adequate ground for -8

Well, I guess McDermott, I suppose, at

least, or McDougal, or whatever his name is.

"all other plaintiffs" -- i.e., Martinez and de Leon -- "herein

10

are third party beneficiaries of the contract between Guillermo

1 1

Gallego Munoz and the defendant Donald Courtney McDougal, Sr."

I've alluded to the con­

Furthermore, if I can draw the Court's

I'm re­

So I think that there are interwoven interests here

12

13

which are established in the record and for purposes of privity

14

those relationships should suffice, with other things.
Now, additionally, these respondents actually had

15

16

the opportunity to intervene in the state court litigation

17

and/or participate, and in fact, respondent Munoz did partici­

18

pate in the state court proceedings and he argued as an amicus

19

curiae before the California Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

25

Could you have named him a party to your

lawsuit?
MR. HARMON:

I think the County might have, but the

problem with that, Your Honor, is conceivably there are hun­
dreds of people who might have been named parties; namely -QUESTION:

But you think -- that bind all of

McDougal's customers on the privity theory.

2

MR. HARMON:

On the facts of this case, yes.

3

Now, the other major issue, I think, that bears on the privity

4

issue is the fact that we're talking about the same piece of

property and the identical rights.

still another ground for binding non-parties, which is, I sup­

This is a land use 'permit.

But it's a restriction on the sale of

water?
MR. HARMON:

Right.

But it applies -- what I was

going to say is, it applies to a single parcel of property.
There is no county-wide ordinance which restricts the applica­
tion of water or any other product, for that matter.

That's

indicated, it seems to me, by the pleadings which indicate the

respondents can go eight miles north and purchase water from a

well there.

QUESTION:

Would it .make any difference to your case

if there were a county-wide restriction?
MR. HARMON:

If there were a county-wide restriction

which the respondents were individually affected by, I would cer

7

tainly believe under that set of circumstances they could have

8

standing to challenge the restriction.

by the Court of Appeals and the District Court is Hale v. Bimcc

One of the cases cited

10

for the proposition that third party strangers are not barred

1 1

by reason of a state court adjudication from subsequently chal­

12

lenging in the federal courts a statute that's arguably uncon­

13

If the County had an ordinance which had county­

McDougal, I don't think, would bind third party strangers
separately and individually affected by that ordinance.
Here, though, this permit rose with a particular
parcel of'land, the McDougal parcel.

I think that under all

of the circumstances taken into consideration, the California
litigation has got to once and for all under the theory under­
lying res judicata adjudicate the rights that flow from that
piece of property.

Were the County to purport to enact an

ordinance which says, no, there will be simply no export,
23

then I would think any number of individuals might achieve
24

standing to challenge it.

actually

been a contempt proceeding, a contempt judgment, by the trial

California Supreme Court.

the spirit of the Anti-Injunction Act.

That case along-with others -- Hill v. Martin --

from setting it aside.
MR. HARMON:

The Superior Court, Your Honor, has

MR. HARMON:

MR. KRONBERGER:

That's correct, and I believe that

a person lawfully in this country exercising the right as a
purchaser ought to be able to invoke the basic fabric of this
nation, the Commerce Clause, in a Federal District Court.
QUESTION: ‘ Well, Mr. Kronberger, what if your clients
had litigated the precise same issue that you say they are
now seeking to litigate here in the Federal District Court up
through the California state court system, saying that this
violates the Federal Constitution, the Supreme Court of Cali­
fornia had ruled against them, certiorari denied here.

would agree with your statement.

17

I think we're seeking to answer.
MR. KRONBERGER:

18

It 's’ the standing question that

I would think that if that customer

were raising it under the Commerce Clause, I believe he would

Well, doesn't that open the door to

15

Mr. McDougal to just find somebody, kind of a straw man to

16

go into Federal District Court and relitigate what he's already

lost in the Supreme Court of California?
MR. KRONBERGER:

18

24

25

I don't think the issue was lost

in the Supreme Court of the State of California.

I think the

Supreme Court of the State of California specifically refused
to rule on the issue.

And I think that if we are going to

assert that McDougal went out and found straw men arid somehow
manufactured a lawsuit, that that is an element of proof in
the trial.

And I have to point out, we're here on a prelimi­

nary injunction.

There is nothing in this record to show

ought to have the right to have the question decided either
for them or against them, unless we can say that those parties
were so close to the proceedings in California that they ought
to be bound, and that somehow McDougal stood in their shoes.
I would point out, how could McDougal stand in the shoes of
the three Mexicans, when the very issue that they were

Are you going to argue the anti-injunction

Bimco, number one.

Well, okay, I rest on Hale v.

I think the holding in Hale v. Bimco in

this Court is that third parties simply are not bound by
2283.

This Court in Mitchum v.

Foster said that the test to

determine the applicability of 2283 is to look back at the
law as it existed before Toucey v. New York.

Mr. Justice

And in that decision the Court held, in

unconstitutional the particular regulation in question and said
that they found it very hard to do so after it had been decided
constitutional by the highest state court of Florida, but they
felt that they had to do it.
QUESTION:

I would say that --

It's at least clear that the result of

this federal judgment is that the state court injunction is
unenforceable against McDougal.
28

1

MR. KRONBERGER:

It's unenforceable to the extent

2

that McDougal has commenced selling of water, and I'm not sure

3

what the status of that injunction is anymore, after the some­

4

what delphic contempt order issued by the state courts.

QUESTION:

Well, what exception to the Anti-Injunc­

tion Act do you think this falls.under?

7

MR. KRONBERGER:

I've said, first, of all, the. anti­

8

injunction statute doesn't apply because of Hale v. Bimco and

9

the policies of federalism underlying that.

Secondly, though,

10

if we are going to say that the anti-injunction statute applies

we have pled this case in the context of a civil rights pro­

13

provides:the exception .there.

14

I believe that in that sense that Mitchum v. Foster

I think that to hold 2283 applicable in this case

15

we're going to have to seriously diminish the holding in Hale

16

v. Bimco, or overrule it.

17

ples of federalism that this Court has announced in a series

18

of cases don't warrant it in this particular fact.

19

principles that we look at in the question of enjoining a state

20

court, when we say, you shouldn't, is we want to allow the

21

state courts to try the cases before them free from inter­

22

ference by federal courts.

case.

But in Hale, didn't the Supreme Court of

Florida stay all further proceedings in the state courts pend­

MR. KRONBERGER:

7

Yes, it did, and I think that

8

that's exactly what happened in this case.

First of all, the

9

Superior Court, as I said, in a delphic order it said to

10

McDougal, McDougal, you're ordered to stop selling water 30

1 1

days after the 9th Circuit judgment against you becomes final,

12

and if the County loses in the 9th Circuit the thing is stayed

13

until resolution on appeal.
QUESTION:

14

15

But the Supreme Court of California never

said that?
MR. KRONBERGER:

16

It went to the Court of Appeals

17

because McDougal filed a writ of mandate when he was found in

18

contempt.

19

California and the District Court of Appeals has stayed any

20
21

22
23
24

25

It went up to the District Court of Appeals

in

proceedings with respect to the contempt against McDougal,
pending the outcome of this decision in this Court, so far as
even citing the case.

And it seems to me that the two courts in

California have specifically deferred.
QUESTION:

But not the highest court?

MR.KRONBERGER:

Well, in order to get a deferrance
30

1

from the highest court, the Court of Appeals would have had to

2

turn down McDougal's writ of mandamus and then he would have

gone to the state court.

we're in doubt about issuing an injunction we're to resolve

that doubt in favor of allowing the state court proceedings to

third parties 2283 is not applicable and you're dealing with

13

believe we're within an exception to that.

14

Yes, we have alleged civil rights

And if we are going to apply 2283, I

I think that, 2283, the final outcome of 2283 being

15

applied in this case is simply going to be to divest Federal

16

District courts of diversity jurisdiction in this circumstance.

17

You are going to be saying, go to the state courts.

18

QUESTION:

Well, it isn't diversity jurisdiction.

19

If you really mean what you say, you're raising -- it's a

federal question case.

MR. KRONBERGER:

It's a federal question case and

the ultimate result of 228 3's application would be to tell a
plaintiff such as the plaintiffs here, the respondents, to
bring these questions in a state court because -QUESTION:

Well, that's what —

from injunc­

QUESTION:

3

That's what the Anti-Injunction Act does

4

in cases to which it applies, that—it says if you want to

5

get the injunction set aside, go raise your federal issues

6

in the state court.

7

QUESTION:

Which issued the injunction.

8

QUESTION:

And you could have done that, you know;

9

you still could.
MR. KRONBERGER:

10
1 1

Well, we could go to a state court

but I think the parties --

QUESTION:

To the, to the Superior Court and say --

QUESTION:

The court that issued the injunction.

14

MR. KRONBERGER:

Well, we would have had to have

What did the Superior Court, how did the

Superior Court rule on your claims originally?
MR. KRONBERGER:

I have no claims -- we have never

been in the Superior Court.
QUESTION:

Well, where did you start -- did you start

the case -- where did you start the case?
MR. KRONBERGER:

I started this case in the Federal

District Court.

QUESTION:

MR. KRONBERGER:

No, no.

Where did McDougal litigate?

McDougal was hit with an injunctive

Superior Court.

MR. KRONBERGER:

And the Superior Court said, no,

the export ban is not with respect to interstate and foreign
commerce.
QUESTION:

1 1

12

But

So the viewscofUthe State' Superior Court

are well known?

13

MR. KRONBERGER:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, the State Superior --

So, if you went to the state court, you

15

know what the judgment would be in the Superior Court, but

16

then you may not be bound in the State Supreme Court?
MR. KRONBERGER:

17

That's correct but I would just

18

for the record say, my clients don't want to be in the state

19

court.

20
21

22
23
24

25

They have a right to access to the federal court and

for a variety of reasons choose not to be in the state court.
Following the line of what happened, McDougal was first told
that the restriction was land use oriented and did not burden
interstate commerce.

It got to the Court of Appeals and this

California Court of Appeals said, it's patently unconstitu­
tional, it burdens interstate commerce, and they declared the
37

1

entire conditional use permit void.

2

nothing.

3

which sidestepped the issue of what happens in California with

4

respect to a conditional use permit which has an unconstitu­

5

tional condition attached to it, it sidestepped it by saying,

6

you're estopped.

7

because there are thousands of restrictions on conditional

8

use permits in the State of California, very few of which

9

probably rise to the dignity of a constitutional challenge,

And McDougal was left with

McDougal appealed to the California Supreme Court,

And that makes, I think, a good deal of sense

10

and I don't think California courts wanted to open their courts

1 1

to those kinds of challenges.

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Did McDougal petition for certiorari to

this Court?
MR. KRONBERGER:

Yes, he did and this Court deter­

15

mined that the estoppel was an independent state grounds upon

16

which the judgment might rest.

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Yes, he did.

I would like to just, briefly at the end, say that
the federal policies that would be thwarted by application of
2283 -- and I think the implicit overruling of Hale v. Bimco,
will be to tell plaintiffs that 2283 may be used as a forum
shopping tool by the respondent or defendant.

All they need

do is raise 2283 to a third party and that third party who
has never been in a state court -- he's told, gee, you should
have started your lawsuit in a state court when we had a fed­
eral question with diversity jurisdiction.
38

1

In conclusion, I would suggest that to apply 2283

2

to third party non-litigants would elevate the provisions of

3

that section against the basic fundamental notion and concept

4

that parties ought to be given their day in the court of their

5

choice and with respect to federal questions they ought to be

6

able to bring federal questions to a federal court to litigate

7

it.

8

who were not participating in state court proceedings should

9

ever be denied injunctive relief in a federal court when it is

I don't think that Congress ever intended that parties

10

properly brought before that court.

There is no reference whatsoever to 1983 as a possi­
