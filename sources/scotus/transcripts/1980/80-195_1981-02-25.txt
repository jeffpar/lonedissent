1

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2

We'll hear arguments

3

first this morning in Metromedia, Incorporated v. City of

4

San Diego.
Mr. Abrams, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

7

MR. ABRAMS:

8
9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is an appeal from a decision of the California

11

Supreme Court upholding against constitutional challenge

12

a San Diego ordinance the purpose and effect of which is to

13

prohibit all off-premise outdoor advertising within the City

14

of San Diego.

15

ties in the briefs as to the precise scope of the statute and

16

I would like to begin my argument with that.

17

There has been some dispute between the par­

The parties have stipulated that San Diego, now the

18

eighth largest city in the nation and the second in Califor­

19

nia, is a sprawling 320-mile city filled with hundreds of

20

miles of streets, with a significant industrial and commercial

21

area, and as well, of course, with park areas, beach areas,

22

residential and other areas.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Would it make any difference, Mr. Abrams,

if this were a town of 10,000?
MR. ABRAMS:

It would make a difference only in
3

1

this sense, Mr. Chief Justice, we do think that it is rele­

2

vant that this is a case which arises entirely out of a ban

3

which takes place in an industrial and commercial area, in

4

part because we are met with the argument by our opponents

5

that outdoor advertising is in its entirety commercial speech,

6

which it is not.

7

even if it is, as it is, more commercial speech than other

8

kinds of speech, then it's surely relevant that we deal here

9

only with an industrial and commercial area.

But even if it were commercial speech, or

In a smaller

10

community which had an industrial and commercial area, we

11

would be urging on you virtually the same arguments as today.

12

It is conceivable that in some other area, on some different

13

facts, absent the stipulated record here today, that a balance

14

could conceivably be struck in a different fashion than we

15

are urging on you today.

16

be the case in an area of 10,000 people rather than a large

17

industrial city.

18

QUESTION:

It is conceivable that that could

Mr. Abrams, I gather that you concede,

19

at least implicitly, that outdoor advertising could consti­

20

tutionally be banned in a residential area?

21

MR. ABRAMS:

We do concede, Mr. Justice Stewart,

22

that it could be banned In certain residential areas, partic­

23

ularly, for example, a residential area as part of a larger

24

community where it is allowed elsewhere; yes.

25

QUESTION:

Some communities are zoned entirely
4

1

residential?

2

MR. ABRAMS:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, and -Some governmental entities are, almost?
All I'm saying is that we think it

5

does depend, as a number of the cases of this Court in other

6

areas have indicated, upon the relationship between one area

7

and another.

8

example, we certainly do concede that that is doable.

9
10

If there's a residential area of a city, for

QUESTION:

Some governmental entities are so-called

bedroom communities, under the law entirely residential.

11

MR. ABRAMS:

12

same acute fashion the issue --

13

QUESTION:

14

Diego are relevant?

Yes, and that does not raise in the

So the size and characteristics of San

15

MR. ABRAMS:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Would that mean that in an area that was

17

mixed, that is, residences and stores and theaters and the

18

usual mix, you'd have a different rule?

19

MR. ABRAMS:

We think the rule of law that we would

20

urge on you today would be the same.

The only thing that

21

would be different is that to the extent that there is any

22

balance to be struck at all, I must acknowledge to you that it

23

is at least conceivable on a different factual record that

24

the balance could be struck in a different way than we would

25

urge on you today.

If you do anything less than establish a
5

1

per se rule that under no circumstances may outdoor adver­

2

tising be banned -- and we have not gone that far in our ad­

3

vocacy view -- implicit in that is that there could be some

4

circumstance, and that there would be some circumstance, in

5

which it could be proper to ban outdoor advertising.
Now, there are factors we think that you should

6
7

consider.

There are things to be weighed in making that

8

decision, but one of them, we think, is that this arises in

9

a commercial and industrial area of a large urban community.

10

I wish to emphasize that based on the stipulated facts we

1 1

deal here with a case where San Diego has 2.8 percent of the

12

city which is zoned commercial and industrial.

13

advertising as the parties have defined it, as legislation

14

generally defines it, is in that area.

All outdoor

And by outdoor advertising we mean outdoor adver­

15
16

tising as distinguished from so-called on-site advertising.

17

On-site advertising is basically advertising about the

18

building, the place itself in which an event, a business,

19

occurs.

20

Outdoor advertising, as the parties have stipulated, is a

21

different thing.

It is, as the parties have said, a medium

22

of communication.

It is in fact a medium which is distinct

23

and unique in a variety of ways.

24

25

The service is sold there, the products made there.

QUESTION:

But it's a medium of communication that

is made a medium of communication only by the fact that the
6

1

city has put in roads which lead past the billboard, is it

2

not?

3
4
5

6
7

I mean, if you had an -MR. ABRAMS:

It would not exist, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, if there were no roads.
QUESTION:

Well, you wouldn't have a big billboard

50 miles out in the desert where no one could see it.
MR. ABRAMS:

That's correct.

One wouldn't choose

8

to build it there, but I would say that it is no less a

9

medium of communication because it's based on roads than sounc

10

trucks are, which need roads to travel on.

1 1

cation are not the same, but the fact that one requires a

12

road to be on or to travel on doesn't seem to us to make it

13

any less a medium of communication.

14
15

QUESTION:

Media of communi­

But a billboard wouldn't be constructed

before the road was there.

16

MR. ABRAMS:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ABRAMS:

That's correct.
A sound truck wouldn't either.
A sound truck wouldn't be there.

19

A leaflet distributor wouldn't have streets to walk on, if

20

he were distributing leaflets, unless the streets were there.

21

I think it fair to say that these things are, in this respect

22

at least, essentially the same.

23

for billboards to exist one needs the things, the road near

24

it to exist.

25

It is perfectly true that

And we don't think that makes it any less a

7

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Abrams, does your approach suggest

2

that the analysis is time, place, and manner, rather than

3

content?

Rather than compelling state interest?
MR. ABRAMS:

4

We would urge on you, as strenuously

5

as we can, Mr. Justice Brennan, that no less than a compelling

6

state interest test ought to be applied.

7

reasons -- I would like to turn -QUESTION:

8
9

Now, we believe, for

Whether as commercial advertising,

ideological or whatever?
MR. ABRAMS:

10

That the medium itself can't be des­

11

troyed unless you meet something in the order of a compelling

12

state interest test and a statute drafted as the compelling

13

state interest test requires, of the narrowest possible

14

nature to serve the interest.

15

QUESTION:

Well, now, Mr. Abrams, zoning ordinances

16

and zoning laws typically if not universally

17

advertising from residential areas throughout the country.

18

And you're not here taking any issue with such laws as that,

19

are you?

20

MR. ABRAMS:

21

QUESTION:

ban outdoor

That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.
Is it also true that the First Amendment

22

issue would be the same If there had been no history of out­

23

door advertising in San Diego but that you wanted to enter

24

the market for the first time?

25

MR. ABRAMS:

It would in the main be the same,
8

1

Mr. Justice Stevens.

The only difference that I can conceive

2

of is this.

3

test were applied -- as we would urge on you that it is not

4

the correct test, but if that were applied -- alternative

5

channels of communication is one of the aspects of that test.

6

Again, it is conceivable, although I think highly unlikely

7

and it's really not the case in San Diego, that a community

8

which has never ever had any kind of outdoor advertising

9

could in theory have built up such alternatives of such a

To the extent that a time, place, and manner

10

discreet and unique nature to compensate for the absence of

1 1

it that maybe in some city or community they have found their

12

way around it.

13

I don't think that's likely and it is our argument

14

to you that the issue is basically the same, for example, in

15

San Diego, whether no

16

there are a number of billboards available now.

17

billboards had been built or whether

Now, the reason that we feel freer to say that in

18

San Diego is that we do have a stipulation of the parties

19

which says, in as close to so many words as parties can, that

20

there are no alternative means which do suffice.

21

comfortable at least in the San Diego context of saying to

22

you that whether or not there were a lot of billboards there

23

or not, the result

QUESTION:

So I am

should be the same.
I'm not familiar with that part of the

There are no alternative means that suffice
9

1

to do what?
MR. ABRAMS:

2
3

Well, stipulation 28 entered into by

the parties --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ABRAMS:

Where can we find that?
It's at page 125a and 126a of the

6

jurisdictional statement.

It says:

"Valuable commercial,

7

political, and social information is communicated to the

8

public through the use of outdoor advertising.

9

ses and politicians and other persons rely upon outdoor ad­

Many busines­

10

vertising because other forms of advertising are insuffi­

11

cient, inappropriate, and prohibitively expensive."
We think that goes about as far as parties could,

12
13

or indeed, a court could, to establish the fact that alterna­

14

tive channels of communication are insufficient to serve the

15

many people who find outdoor advertising indispensable in

16

San Diego.

17

clear enough on its face.

And the language of the stipulation, we think, is

QUESTION: I suppose that's really just another way

18
19

of saying there's a market for outdoor advertising?

20

people prefer it as the most efficient way of communicating

21

their message.
MR. ABRAMS:

22

Some

Well, I think the parties, Mr. Justice

23

Stevens, really would have said "some" if they had meant

24

"some."

25

"Many" -QUESTION:

Well, "many."
10

MR. ABRAMS:

1

2

"large" --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ABRAMS:

5

The dictionary definition of "many" is

Over 20?
Oh, no, no, not over 20.

It does

seem to us that -QUESTION:

6

However, the number of people who use

7

outdoor advertising probably is related to the number of signs

8

you have up, because they're all being sold and used.

9

that's what -- you have many signs.

10

them.

1 1

advertise.

12

So

So many people are using

They've obviously found it the most efficient way to

MR. ABRAMS:

That's true.

But what the stipulation

13

indicates to you and what a brief, for example, submitted to

14

you amicus curiae by users of outdoor advertising in support

15

of the stipulation indicate to you is that this is not a

16

little thing, that this is in fact many businesses, and they

17

find it the best way to communicate.

18

ness-oriented, and that they do it because other means are

19

insufficient, inappropriate, and prohibitively expensive.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, along with my brother Stevens

I have trouble with the word "many."
MR. ABRAMS:

Well, the dictionary definition,

23

Mr. Justice Marshall, is "large."

24

tell you it's --

25

And it's not just busi­

QUESTION:

I can't do better than to

Well, I mean, without precedent,
11

1

our opinion would have to say that the precedent is that in

2

the case where "many businesses" et cetera et cetera, that

3

this would be invalid.

4

MR. ABRAMS:

No.

If you were to apply a time,

5

place, and manner test, what your opinion, what the prece­

6

dent, as I view it, would be is that where alternate channels

7

of communication are as a matter of fact -- in this case we

8

think it is, as a matter of fact -- and where they are, as a

9

matter of fact, insufficient --

10

QUESTION:

But It doesn't say that they're -- this

11

does not say that they are insufficient, it says many people

12

think it is insufficient.

13

MR. ABRAMS:

Isn't that what It says?

Well, it says,

many people of a varie­

14

ty of sorts rely upon it because other means are insufficient,

15

inappropriate, and prohibitively expensive.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ABRAMS:

18

QUESTION:

19

20

Well, it doesn't say it's true or not.
I'm sorry?
It doesn't say it's a fact or not, it

just says, many people think it's a fact.
MR. ABRAMS:

Well, if I can go back to the Linmark

21

case, for example,

22

in the context of dealing with signs on lawns, the Court in­

23

dicated that it was by no means clear that other means of

24

communication would serve, even though that was a situation

25

in which ads could be put In the newspaper and that there

which Your Honor wrote a few years ago,

12

1

were other ways to communicate.

2

we? -- that there are other ways to communicate.

3

urge on you is that in the context where you have a distinct,

4

unique kind of communication, that at least the law ought to

5

provide a First Amendment test -- and we think we can meet

6

any First Amendment test, but a First Amendment test -- and

7

not simply a property-oriented test before allowing its com­

8

plete destruction.

13
14

QUESTION:

We don't deny -- how could
What we do

And that -One more question and then I'm true.

Is there any testimony other than that stipulation?
HR. ABRAMS:

There was no testimony, Your Honor,

because this case came up -QUESTION:

That's right.

So that's the only thing

we've got, to say that there are not other means?

15

MR. ABRAMS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ABRAMS:

That is the record on this subject.
That's what I'm saying.
There are briefs which lend support to

18

that record, but the record as such, on that point, is the

19

stipulation.

20
21

Now --

QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, is the joint stipulation of

facts in the joint appendix the same

22

MR. ABRAMS:

23

QUESTION:

stipulation?

Yes, sir.
I’d prefer to use it because the one in

24

the jurisdictional statement has an amazing word "prohibi-

25

tilly" in there.
13

1

2
3

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, that was a typographical error

that should be corrected.
QUESTION:

It's corrected in the other one and I

4

think the Joint Stipulation probably is the preferred one to

5

use, the one in the Joint Appendix.

6

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes -- I must tell you, though,

7

Mr. Justice Blackmun, that the typographical error was in the

8

stipulation and we corrected it, as it were.

9

QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS:

No, sir, and I don't think anyone's

QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, supposing that the City of

14

San Diego, instead of barring outside advertising, had barred

15

dirigibles from coming below a 500-foot level over the city

16

limits, which carried signs similar to billboard signs?

17

you make the same argument?

18

MR. ABRAMS:

Woulc

I hope not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

19

I don't believe that dirigibles carrying signs are a distinct

20

medium of communication.

21

medium of communication in the same sense as Congress, say,

22

itself in various legislation referring to outdoor advertis­

23

ing, meaning and saying that they mean commercial billboards

24

as outdoor advertising.

25

of the commonplace use through centuries of outdoor

They're certainly not a recognized

advertising.
QUESTION:

Well, we all know that Goodyear or

Goodrich, I forget which it is, blimp.
MR. ABRAMS:

No, I think that, you know, one is

5

entitled -- I would like to put it this way, that the response

6

that I would give to the question of, how can you tell if

7

something is a medium of communication, because I think that's

8

what we're really addressing now, is well put by Mr. Justice

9

Black in the Martin v.

Struthers case when he dealt with

10

door-to-door solicitation.

11

door-to-door solicitation, he looked at the commonplace nature

12

of door-to-door solicitation, he looked at the fact that it

13

was available and important to diverse groups of citizens.

14

Those things are true, we think, on the stipulated record of this

15

case, and on the facts of this case, with respect to outdoor

16

advertising.

17
18
19

And he looked at the history of

I don't think it's true with respect to dirigibles
flying over a community.
QUESTION:

Beyond that --

It could be with respect to small air­

20

planes carrying signs in Miami, though.

21

the same sort of thing.

22
23
24
25

MR. ABRAMS:

Maybe that isn't

That, too -- I mean, the fact that

these things happen, and they do, they are really not -QUESTION:

And they're a regular, customary method

of advertising, frequently used, and some people regard them
15

1

2

as rather an unpleasant sight.
MR. ABRAMS:

But if airplanes went about dropping

3

leaflets, say, I don't think one would call that a medium of

4

communication, even though leaflets are.

5

things which become well established enough, we think, for

6

this Court to give it a treatment as if it is something not

7

the same as other things.

8

the stipulation of the parties, by the recognition by

9

Congress, by its historical use, has achieved that status.

10

QUESTION:

There are some

We think outdoor advertising, by

But you've acknowledged that a residen­

11

tial community which may be growing could start out with

12

no billboard advertising.

13

is that at a point in its growth there would come into being

14

a constitutional right to put billboards up, if it grew grad­

15

ually from a small residential community to a large city?

16

At some point in its historical development a constitutional

17

right would emerge.

18

MR. ABRAMS:

And what you're saying, I suppose,

I responded earlier to Justice Stewart

19

by saying that we do not quarrel with the constitutionality,

20

per se, at least, of zoning regulations which ban outdoor

21

advertising in residential areas.

22

don't want to convey to you the proposition that there is

23

never an area which is residential or of sufficient size or

24

of a sufficient nature where outdoor advertising is not in

25

fact a medium of communication of which the public can't
16

That does not mean, or I

1

be deprived.

I could imagine, for example, a different rul­

2

ing from this Court as to sound trucks going through one kind

3

of community and another.

4

can be banned in their entirety from the width and breadth

5

of San Diego.

6

enough and sleepy enough and quiet enough that the Court might

7

strike a different balance with respect to sound trucks in

8

that area.

9

it would be true with respect to leaflets.

It cannot be that sound trucks

It is conceivable that in a community small

And I think the same is true, I urge upon you,
It does make a

10

difference where First Amendment rights are claimed.

1 1

seems to us that it makes a difference therefore, whether it

12

is claimed in a residential or an urban area.

Do you accept the validity of both

the

Saia and the Kovacs decisions?

15

MR. ABRAMS:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
Mr. Abrams, may I add

one more easy

17

hypothetical?

What would you think of an ordinance adopted

18

by the city government of Washington, D.C., that dealt with

19

billboards of this character in downtown Washington.

20

that ordinance banning -- I suppose there may be one; I don't

21

recall seeing any such ads -- would that ordinance be subject

22

to the same infirmities that you suggest for this one?

need a new factual record as to the nature of the community,

the kind of people that live and work in the community, the

MR. ABRAMS:

11

standard could be applied.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I thought, as time, place, and

standard rather than compelling, doesn't it?

MR. ABRAMS:

If I may, I'd like to do a time, place,

and manner analysis for you.

17

our brief that a time, place, and manner analysis is insuffi­

ciently protective in a situation in which an entire medium

19

is being banned.

20

because we do think it's important even though we think we

21

can meet a time, place, and manner analysis.

22

if there were a ban in let's say a large community or a small

23

community of all magazines or of all something else, the

24

problem with a time, place, and manner analysis is that if

25

the ban gets large enough, sweeping enough, not subject as we

Now, we have urged upon you in

To say this:

If some community were to object to magazines on

4

the basis of littering the streets and big trucks going down

6

the streets delivering magazines, it could be said that that

7

is a significant governmental interest.

8

it is content-neutral, because they're banning all magazines.

9

And it could be said, given the theory of the California

It could be said that

alternative communication.

But it can hardly be said that it's a

13

time, place, and manner regulation, if it's a total prohibi­

tion .

15

MR. ABRAMS:

Well, our view is that it is not.

16

cannot be a time, place, and manner regulation if it is a

17

total prohibition, for the reasons that I stated.

18

prohibition is, at its essence, something which is not

19

time, place, and manner restriction.

QUESTION:

21

MR. ABRAMS:

It's self-contradictory.
Now, it happens in this case that we

22

believe, for reasons I've indicated earlier, that even if we

23

had to show you the absence of alternative channels of com­

24

munication, that the stipulation of the parties goes a long

25

way, and that for reasons stated in our brief the statute is
20

1

underinclusive in other ways, and so we think it can't be

2

shown by them, as they must show, even in the time, place,

3

and manner test, it can't be shown by the City of San Diego

4

that it is in fact content neutral, because of what it leaves

5

untouched.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, in your answer to Justice

7

Powell's question a moment ago, you said that if it were

8

federal land here in the District involved, it perhaps could

9

be sustained.

And yet the First Amendment is directed against

10

the Federal Government, and it presumably incorporated only

11

by the Fourteenth as against the states.

12

that the Federal Government has more right to ban than the

13

states ?

14

MR. ABRAMS:

Absolutely not.

Are you suggesting

I was simply trying

15

to be informational about what I understand to be the law

QUESTION:

How can you justify a ban on billboards

across the street from the Supreme Court, as you suggested?
MR. ABRAMS:

I can justify that as a time, place,

6

and manner limitation.

It seems to me that if we are told that

7

there there is a part of a city in which billboards are not

8

to be allowed but that they are to be allowed elsewhere, that

9

is a classic time, place, and manner limitation, precisely

10

the same as if you said, no sound trucks outside the Supreme

11

Court, or certain other limitations so long as there are

12

other places where it can be done.

13

QUESTION:

Well, if V/ashington had been limited to

14

the governmental buildings and the park and historic areas

15

and residential areas and there had been no manufacturing

16

area, could there be a total ban in the city of Washington?

17

MR. ABRAMS:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I don't think

18

there could be a total ban, but I would have to concede that

19

the balance would be a different kind of balance.

20

QUESTION:

How about the city of Williamsburg,

21

Virginia, historic restoration?

22

MR. ABRAMS:

Could they totally ban it?

I would give the same answer, that a

23

different balance would have to be struck based on the nature

24

of the community and the activities which occur.

25

QUESTION:

But your basic answer, Mr. Abrams,
22

1

I think is that it would depend upon what you produced by

2

the evidence in such a case.

3
4

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, in each of these cases there

would necessarily be a different factual record.

Well, what other than factories, what

kind of community that does not have any manufacturing dis­
trict in it could not ban billboards?

It seems to me you've

conceded that they could be banned In historic areas, con­
ceded they could be banned in residential areas.

But if the

15

city adds a manufacturing area, then is.it the constitutional

16

duty to allow billboards?

17

MR. ABRAMS:

Well, what I'm saying is that the

18

easiest case for determination is one in which there is a

19

manufacturing area, and that that, in and of itself, ought to

20

at least presumptively lead you to say that you can't have a

21

22
23
24
25

total ban.

The hardest -QUESTION:

Because

esthetic considerations of the

governmental entity are minimal within such an area.
MR. ABRAMS:

Yes; absolutely.

Now, the hardest

case for me to argue to you, that a ban, a total ban is
23

1

unconstitutional, is in the smallest, most Williamsburg-like

If you concede that that might be, at

least, I think you've said, a constitutional, notwithstanding,

25

MR. ABRAMS:

On my submission, what I am conceding

MR. ABRAMS:

Of proving what?

What is a compelling state interest?
Well, it is something more than a

significant state interest.

It is of overriding importance.

10

Now, we think that there is some real doubt as to, and,

indeed, we urge upon you that the simple assertion of esthe­

a multibillion dollar business today.

ban all advertising on radio and television?

25

MR. ABRAMS:

Could Congress totally

Notwithstanding that radio and

1

television is a regulated industry and that Congress has a

2

significant amount of power with respect to it, I believe it

3

would raise very grave constitutional problems.
QUESTION:

4
5

6

But they've banned some kinds of adver­

tising?
MR. ABRAMS:

They have indeed, Mr. Chief Justice,

7

but to have a total ban would in effect preclude radio and

8

television from covering the news, because they wouldn't be

9

able to do it, from doing other things which on anyone's

10

theory in this room would be First Amendment-protected.

11

that is also one --

QUESTION:

13

And

Well, in some countries they do it

MR. ABRAMS:

In some countries they do it without

advertising.

16

that given the nature of broadcast regulation as we have in

17

this country, to switch it so as totally to deprive broad­

18

casters of the opportunity to stay in business and hence to

19

do all the First Amendment-protected things that then they do.

20

would at least raise very serious First Amendment problems.

21

It would be my view, perhaps for another day,

QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, suppose the ordinance per­

For one thing, it would discriminate --

with respect to that?

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry.

The same argument as you've been making,

Yes, I would think that the same argu­

15

ment I would be making, I would perhaps emphasize a little

16

more, that even if you were to apply the commercial speech

17

cases of this Court, and even if you were to assume that there

18

was nothing more to protect here than that which this Court

19

has said must be protected in the area of commercial speech,

20

that this statute cannot meet a test which says that it's no

21

more extensive than necessary.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

But that isn't the compelling interest

test, is it?
MR. ABRAMS:

No, I 'm saying that even if you apply

a much lower level test, even if you apply a pure commercial

speech test, that a statute which is a flat ban on all com­

2

mercial billboard speech within a commercial area --

QUESTION:

So your facial attack on this ordinance

is really an overbreadth attack?
MR. ABRAMS:

That that is one of the devices

of this statute.
QUESTION:

To the extent that you're invoking the

8

compelling state interest, you're really arguing that the

9

ordinance is invalid because it bans noncommercial billboard?

10

MR. ABRAMS:

No, sir, I'm saying that it is, that

11

the reason we urge upon you a compelling state interest test

12

or a test of that order of magnitude is because of the flat­

13

ness of the ban here.

14

QUESTION:

Well, and because it's -- but if it

15

only banned commercial speech, you wouldn't invoke the com­

16

pelling state interest?

17
18
19

MR. ABRAMS:

If it only banned commercial speech

I would urge upon you a test which is of less protection -QUESTION:

Well, I know, but the only reason then

20

that you're urging on us. the compelling state interest test

21

is because it is a flat ban and includes noncommercial bill­

22

boarding things.

23

MR. ABRAMS:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. ABRAMS:

But, what I'm saying -Is that right or not?
It is correct that the advocacy of the
28

1

compelling state interest test arises out of the totality of

2

the ban which includes ideological and commercial speech.
QUESTION:

3

Well, why -- well, In that event, why

4

wouldn't we have to divide the case up into whether the ordi­

5

nance is valid with respect to commercial speech and valid

6

in -- and the test would be the noncommercial speech?
MR. ABRAMS:

7

Well, let me say, first of all because

8

we have agreement of the parties here that if commercial

9

speech is not allowed there can be no so-called ideological

10

speech on outdoor advertising.

11

Mr. Sumption agreed to it in his brief.
QUESTION:

12

13
14

We urged that in our brief;
He's --

Well, I know, but you can't stipulate

us in -MR. ABRAMS:

I'm not saying that you are bound

15

by that, I'm saying that it is certainly relevant in your

16

consideration of the effects of a total ban. And what I am

17

saying is that even if you were to give us the most minimal

18

test afforded by this Court under the commercial speech doc­

19

trine, that there is no way that the final prong of that

20

doctrine can be met on the basis of a flat ban.

21

is that the regulation can be no more extensive than is

22

necessary to serve the state interest which is asserted.

23

And flat bans such as this --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. ABRAMS:

That prong

Mr. Abrams, it seems to me that you're --- given the assertion by them of the
29

1

state interest that they assert and the total failure on this

2

record of San Diego to meet any burden whatsoever, other than

3

saying we haven't met a burden, would in and of itself resolve

4

this case in our favor.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Abrams, it seems to me that your

response to Justice White

7

ban would be even more objectionable than the total ban be­

8

cause (a) it wouldn't take down the billboards and (b) it

would be content-related.

1 1

it would have the vice of all content-related statutes.

perfectly proper to say in the historic section of

of the reasons that it's proper is that in fact you do have

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

MR. SUMPTION:

1

2
3
4
5

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I'd like to get straight at the outset a few fac­
tual statements that I think need some elucidation.
First of all, the City of San Diego's ordinance does

6

not prohibit all off-premise signs.

I believe that was

7

Mr. Abrams' statement.

8

of off-site advertising that is commonly referred to as

9

billboards.

What it does is prohibit certain types

The California Supreme Court specifically nar­

10

rowed, gave a narrowing construction to the ordinance,

11

applying it against the commercial type billboard, and indi­

12

cated that it would not apply to small yard signs or things

13

of this nature, of picket signs evidencing a labor dispute,

14

things of this nature.

15

The stipulation No. 28 that Mr. Abrams refers to

16

does not say that there are no alternative means of communi­

17

cation or advertising.

18

stipulation is ambiguous.

19

into that stipulation the ordinance was amended to add I be­

20

lieve it was either the 12th or 13th exception to the signs

21

prohibited by excepting out temporary political campaign

22

signs, a rather large area of signs.

23

QUESTION:

24

or hurts your case?

25

First of all, the language of the
Secondly, subsequent to entering

Do you think that amendment strengthens

MR. SUMPTION:

It strengthens the case, Your Honor,
33

1

because without it it would mean, it would ban political cam­

2

paign signs.

3

entered into was that, I think it's a commonly known fact

4

that certain politicians do make use of off-site advertising

5

to advertise their campaigns.

And part of the reason that the stipulation was

And the last point on the stipulation is that the

6
7

California Supreme Court indicated that to the extent that a

8

person may feel that he cannot convey his mssage without the

9

use of an off-site billboard-type sign, that that person coulc

10

come in and challenge the ordinance as applied to him.

But

11

the court said that that was not sufficient to strike down

12

the ordinance on its face.

13

Another statement was made, that the City of San

14

Diego has agreed somehow that if you can't have commercial

15

speech you can't have noncommercial or political and social

16

speech.

17

What we did is, by way of argument in our brief, that that is

18

in fact the position of the billboard companies.

19

turned their own argument around against them in the context

20

of saying that this demonstrates even further that what we're

21

talking about is a commercial means of exploiting speech;

22

that the income behind it is what enables the limited numbers

23

of noncommercial speech to even exist.

24

that.

25

That's an incorrect statement of the City position.

Is that sufficient?

I think that in view of some of the

past decisions of this Court

the fact that it's commercial

is sufficient.
QUESTION:

1 1

Mr. Sumption, let me get back to your

12

amendments.

What justification is there for exempting a tem­

13

porary political campaign sign, but prohibiting other politi­

14

cal signs such as are demonstrated in the jurisdictional

15

statement?
MR. SUMPTION:

16

Well, there are several reasons, I

17

think, behind that.

18

They are temporary in nature.

19

er is not anywhere near as extensive as the permanent bill-

20

board-type structure that's there long after the message goes.

21

The courts have said -QUESTION:

22

First of all, campaigns come and go.
The typical campaign type post­

I take it that this one on "Welcome to

23

San Diego, Home of the 1,100 Underpaid Cops," is somewhat

24

temporary?

25

MR. SUMPTION:

The copy itself may be somewhat

temporary, but the sign is there long after the message is

gone.

another customer to put another message on?
MR. SUMPTION:

10

11

That's also my understanding of the

way they operate their business.

12

Also, as I started to say, the courts have given

13

political speech, campaign-type speech, placed it on the

14

highest level.

advertising was excepted out from the prohibitions of this

16

ordinance.

And that's another reason why campaign-type

that allow the permanent billboards to be used for these

20

political ads?

21

Or is it something less?

MR. SUMPTION:

Well, the actual language of the

22

exception simply says they're not prohibited by the ordinance,

23

so it's permanent.

24

I mean, can they use the permanent bill­

The ordinance is silent on the

But what are you telling us here?

You

seem to think it,fs significant, and is it significant in the

5

sense that it allows these billboards to be used, or that they

can just use posters, which I guess they could have, anyway?
MR. SUMPTION:

7

I think that the logical Intent woulc

be that political campaign signs should be something less

than on permanent structures,

MR. SUMPTION:

It begins at page 104a in the

Appendix to the jurisdictional statement, Your Honor. And the

23

actual exception itself would be on page 112a, No. 12.

24

the last exception under a list of twelve exceptions.

25

QUESTION:

And when was that added?
37

It's

That was added, Your Honor, while

the case was pending before the California Supreme Court,

before they heard oral argument the first time on the case.

The California Supreme Court had construed it as written.

MR. SUMPTION:

9

Yes, it certainly is, Your Honor.

112a, I think you said?
That's correct, Your Honor.

And as

I indicated, the California Supreme Court further narrowed

10

the application of the ordinance to make sure it didn't apply

11

to such things as yard signs and other non-commercial-type

12

signs.

The history of this case was that it

MR. SUMPTION:

That court's judgment was reversed

In which Justice Clark dissented.
Yes, Your Honor, and the California

Supreme Court did grant a rehearing on the case, and it was

10

argued a second time before the California Supreme Court.

11

At that time the California Supreme Court seemed mostly

12

interested in an amendment to the Federal Highway Beautifica­

13

tion Act as it related to a compensation question, and that's

14

an issue that has been raised by the City of San Diego be­

15

cause it was decided against us by the California Supreme

16

Court on a petition for writ

17

before the Court, but not before it here today.

18

of cert, that's now pending

Another statement that has been made here today by

19

counsel for Metromedia is that somehow the nature of a com­

20

munity and whether or not signs are in commercial versus

21

noncommercial zones areas has a bearing, if not a crucial

22

bearing, on whether or not billboards can be kept out of the

23

city.

24

that's reached from that statement is that somehow the First

25

Amendment is triggered by local zoning.

It seems to me that in essence the logical conclusion

39

And of course zoning, the considerations behind

local zoning, really, are done for reasons completely inde­

QUESTION:

Last time I was there they did.

they're gone now.
MR. SUMPTION:

The other thing about allowing bill­

17

boards in commercial zones but not in others is, it seems to

18

me that the esthetic justification of the ordinance should

19

apply equally in commercial areas because municipalities in­

20

cluding San Diego are recognizing perhaps their past mistakes

21

in allowing commercial areas to be eyesores and trying to

22

improve those areas.

to failure by saying, well, they're not that attractive now,

24

we're bound to leave them that way.

esthetics have an economic or a monetary value by encouraging

tourists to come.

But that's in the content of esthetics?

10

MR. SUMPTION:

11

QUESTION:

It's all tied into esthetics.

Before this argument, Mr. Sumption, was

12

there any limitation on kinetic signs, the kind that have

13

something moving to attract the eye?

14

MR. SUMPTION:

San Diego has attempted to broach

15

the subject of regulating signs by dividing them into off-

16

premise or off-site and on-site.

17

that deals with on-site signs, and it does not allow any

18

moving, flashing, et cetera type signs.

19

20
21
22

QUESTION:

We have a separate ordinance

So, what about signs -- there's an excep­

What they're talking about is if it

I couldn't answer the specifics.

QUESTION:

Now, is San Diego submitting that its

17

esthetic justification is a compelling state interest or

18

something less?

19

MR. SUMPTION:

Well, Your Honor, again I think we

20

get into semantics.

21

yes, we do feel it's a compelling state interest.

22

secondly, this Court in its O'Brien decision cited in our brie f

23

has indicated that really there's a series of four or five

24

words that have been used almost interchangeably:

25

prevailing, substantial, compelling.

I would answer your question by saying,

boil down to the same thing.

MR. SUMPTION:

Well, large parts of the entire state of

18

Vermont are regulated in such a manner that there may be no

19

billboards whatever except a sign white on black, two feet

20

high and three feet wide, and on site.

21

could say there's a total ban of all billboard advertising

22

except that kind of sign?

23

MR. SUMPTION:

And I suppose one

That's the kind of semantical probleir ,

24

I think, that we get into when we start putting these in cate­

25

gories like "total prohibition," "total ban."
44

But time,

1

place, and manner, as I understand the Court's decisions, is

2

really a means of distinguishing from a regulation that's

attempting to get at the content of speech, when we're talking

about First Amendment rights.

Furthermore, because of the blight that they have

12

aesthetically, you know, we talk about more narrowly drawn

13

measures, which Mr. Abrams has mentioned, saying that this is

not narrowly drawn because this is a total ban; we get into

subjective decisions on, for example, well, let's talk about

16

the height, or the square footage of the sign.

17

18

tance between billboards, the next thing you have is, well,

19

if we have 1,000 feet between billboards, why not 900 feet?

20

It could have been more narrowly drawn, and you go on and on

21

and on.

If we were to

I think that these things -QUESTION:

And the claim could be made that it's a

total ban of any billboard in that 1,000-foot stretch?
MR. SUMPTION:

That's correct.

These things are

debatable, and better left to the legislative discretion,
45

1

especially when you're in the area of esthetics.

2

Where we've been damned because the ordinance is

3

overinclusive, we've been damned because it's underinclusive,

4

and these are the types of legislative judgments that neces­

5

sarily have to be made when one attempts to deal with a prob­

6

lem of this sort.

7

QUESTION:

Yes, but I suppose, as Mr. Abrams

8

pointed out, that magazines and newspapers sometimes create

9

environmental problems, an awful lot of garbage is created,

10

and litter, and trucks driving at night, waking people up,

11

throwing to the newsboys, and all the rest.

12

make the same kind of argument for a total ban of other forms

of communication media too, based on environmental or esthe­

16

QUESTION:

At least it's that argument.

17

MR. SUMPTION:

Yes.

This Court has never held that

18

there's a constitutional right to a particular mode of ex­

19

pression or the most cost-efficient means of getting a message

20

across, and to the extent that these signs are intrusive and

21

in effect invade the very privacy of people that are unwill­

22

ing to receive the messages, there's no ability to refuse

23

the message, as there is in virtually every other means of

24

communication.

25

unique means of communication, I would have to agree with

Mr. Sumption, does San Diego allow

MR. SUMPTION:

There is advertising, and that's

of off-site advertising as well as on taxicabs and other

15

vehicles.

18

QUESTION:

What about in your ballpark or your

football stadium?
MR. SUMPTION:

There has been -- that's been a

19

matter of controversy.

20

there are some advertisement panels that face In to the

21

stadium but are not visible from the public rights-of-way

22

outside the stadium, and I believe that those messages change

23

to some degree, but I think for the most part they stay there

24

either for quite a while or semi-permanently.

25

QUESTION:

I believe that at the present time

Of course, in that area there would be
50

1

2

no traffic safety arguments, I would assume?
MR. SUMPTION:

That's correct.

If the Court has no

3

other questions, I would just conclude by saying that I think

4

that justifications have been set forth and that this case is

5

not easily squeezed into mechanical principles of other First

6

Amendment cases. This is not a content-based ordinance, and

7

the principles that are cited by counsel for billboard com­

8

panies have been applied in a very different context, and I

9

don't think that they're applicable or binding in this

10
11

fact situation.

And I would close on that note.
