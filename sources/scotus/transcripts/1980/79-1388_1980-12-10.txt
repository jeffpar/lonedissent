ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

We’ll hear arguments..next

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case, entitled Kirchberg v. Feenstra, is a case
that has gone back several years, and I would like to review
some of the facts before proceeding into argument.
Ir 1974, Mr. Karl Jean Kirchberg, my client, decided
to represent Harold Feenstra, based upon charges filed by
Mrs. Feenstra against Mr. Feenstra on the basis of crimes

15

against nature.

My client accepted a mortgage on the Feenstra

16

household based upon the law existing at that time, Articles
17

2404 of the Louisiana Civil Code, and Articles 2334, read in
18

oari materia.
19

Thereafter, Mr. Harold Feenstra did not pay the in­
20

debtedness owed

to Mr. Kirchberg, and Mr. Kirchberg, proceed­

21

ing by executory process, or as it’s called in the civilian
22

phraseology, the law

of Louisiana, via executiva, which is

23

a quick seizure and sale, proceeded

in the lower1 courts of

24

the State of Louisiana, the civil district court in the Parish
25

3

1

of Orleans.

2

QUESTION:

This is the equivalent of a foreclosure

3

in any other state, isn’t it?
MR. SCHOENBERGER:

4

Yes, sir. Mrs. Feenstra's counsel

5

filed for a temporary restraining order, what we call a TBO,

6

and finally a permanent injunction.

7

that Mr. Xirchberg was engaging himself as a creditor and

8

money lender under the Truth in Lending Act.

9

thereafter filed in United States District Court for the

10
11

12

13
14

.And they claim, of course

Mr. Xirchberg

Eastern District of Lousiaiana, and the case was allotted to
the Hon. Judge Morey Sear,

and at that time he preyed -for 'a de­

claratory judgment that hehad not violated the truth in lending
Act, and that issue was later settled and compromised agree­
able to all parties.
But Mrs.

15

In

Feenstra, lo and behold, counterclaims.

her counterclaim, she argues, or she claimed, that. Article

16

2404 , Louisiana head and master provision, is unconstitutional,
17

is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
18

Constitution.

Now it is important to note that initially

19

there was some discrepancy.

It would apoear from the record

20

that the original counterclaim was to Article 2.3 34 , was the
21

article which was unconstitutional.

However, Judge Morey Sear

evidently felt that the gravamen of the complaint was Article
2404, the head and master article.
Thereafter,

in the United States District Court for

4

1

the Eastern District, Mr. Kirchberg filed a motion for summary

2

judgment, saying that there are no material issues of fact,

3

that indeed he should be able to proceed via executiva, and he

4

won by way of motion for summary judgment, and Honorable Judge

5

Sear, looking at Louisiana law and lcokihg toward this bon6rabl|e

6

Court's guidance in Labine v.

7

summary judgment would be granted.
Thereafter, Joan Feenstra appealed to the Fifth

8
9

Vincent held that the motion for

Circuit Court of Anneals and in that decision the holding was

10

that Article 2404 was unconstitutional, and the decision was

11

reversed, but applied prospectively.
QUESTION:

12
13

16
17

18
19

20

Do you think it applied to the

parties, or not?
MR.

14

15

To whom?

SCHOENBERGER:

We do not believe that it does,

Your Honor, and this is part and narde 1 of the -problem.

Having

laid down this basic structure: of where we are moving, let
me -QUESTION:

Well, if you didn't think it applied to

you, why did you appeal?

Why did you come here at all if you

di.dn't think that
ML. SCHOENBERGER:

Your Honor, we are saying that■if

21

the decision applies

it’

is purely prospectively.

Only under

22

Linkletter does -23

QUESTION:

Well, does it apply to your client, or

24

doesn't it?
25

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

1

2

applied prospectively, on the notion for sumrary judgment.
QUESTION:

3
4

Your Honor, it says, reversed,

You just told me you didn’t think it

applied to your client.
MR. SCHOENBERGER:

5

Your Honor, this is part of the

6

problem.

7

and filed on October 22, 1974.

8

that the underlying mortgage is invalid.

9

Article 2404 is unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

10
11

14

15
16

The 5th Circuit never said
It only said that

Well, what is -- so, you vzant to come up

here to have us declare your mortgage invalid?
MR. SCHOENBERGER: No, no, Your Honor.

12
13

The mortgage, the underlying mortgage was executed

We are arguing

that if this is applied purely prospectively, and looks to the
future, then it cannot look to the past, and it cannot look
to 1974, when Karl Jean Kirchberg relied upon the civil 1aw
as it existed at that time.
QUESTION:

17

no

But then there's no case or controversy,

live case or controversy, it's just purely a decision of

18

an abstract proposition which doesn't have any effect on
19

concrete rights of the parties.
20

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

I -- this --

21

QUESTION:

Why did you come here at all, if you

22

didn't -23

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Well, Your Honor, this was one

24

possibility, and I had to juggle with this problem -25

6

1

2
3

QUESTION:

I suppose one of'your questions, if1you

want to ask hack, is why did'we ever grant it?
MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Well, Your Honor, it's -- and the

4

other way in which I have viewed this particular decision is

5

that maybe it does apply to the parties on the motion for

6

summary judgment, but since it looks prospectively, it does

7

not apply to the mortgage

8

this is the important point to note, we- look at the 5th Circuit

9

language, the very end of the opinion.

10
1 1

12
13
14

15
16
17

as recorded in 1974 , because --- and

It says:

"We reverse.

We apply prospectively, because not to do so would create
substantial hardship within the State of Louisiana."
QUESTION:

But to say that it applies to the parties

but not to the mortgage is really kind of a conundrum because
the only controversy betweeen the parties is with respect to
the mortgage, isn't it?
MR. SCHOENBERGER:

It is with respect to the mort­

gage, Ycur Honor, but the situation of the case is such that,
it moved up on a motion for summary judgment.

And indeed, if

18

the 5th Circuit is making any sense -- and indeed, Corpus
19

Christi, also another opinion of the Supreme Court of the
20

State of Louisiana, mentioned the substantial hardship.
21

It must mean that Mr. Kirchberg's mortgage is valid as of the
22

date of October, 1974, because if it is not then we do have
23

that substantial hardship, because the new law did not come
24

into effect till January 1, 1980.

QUESTION:

What relief do you want here?

2

MR. SCHOENBERG:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. SCHOENBERG:

We have six years.

What relief do you want here?
The relief that we would have this

5

Court grant is that Article 2404 would be declared constitu­

6

tional, and that Mr. Karl Jean Kirchberg could proceed via

7

executiva to have the Feenstra home seized and sold.

8

would be the relief that we would ask.
QUESTION:

9

This

You'd be just as happy, I suppose, if you

10

had a ruling that whatever the Court of Appeals said didn't

1 1

invalidate your mortgage?

12

MR. SCHOENBERG:

13

the*, other way of proceeding through this.
QUESTION:

21

22

Yes, yes, Your Honor.

That would be

Having —

And if we read the Court of Appeals'

decision as not invalidating your mortgage, you'd be; very
happy.
MR. SCHOENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

But then, what controversy would the

Court of Appeals have adjudicated within the -QUESTION:

We 'would then dismiss the appeal, T

suppose, as for want of jurisdiction.
MR. SCHOENBERG:

Well, the case or controversy would

involve the motion for summary judgment between Mr. Kirchberg
23

and Joan Paillot Feenstra.

as to the constitutionality of

24

Article 2404.

I realize the difficulties, Your Honors, and

25

8

1

I've thought about this in depth, and it is a problem, it is

2

a problem, it's a serious problem.

3

here, and that is why I'm addressing the three issues before

4

the Court.

5

with the issue of Article 2404 as it is.

6

And that is why we are

Maybe what I would like to do is to proceed first

And of course, beginning -- of course we begin with

7

the private lav; of Louisiana contained therein in the Civil

8

Code of cur state, in which Article 1 states clearly, "Law is

9

a solemn expression of legislative will."

Of course, the

10

law of stare decisis does not technically apply in Louisiana.

1 1

We look to our Legislature in determining in true civilian

12

fs.shion as is done in Quebec and is applied in France as to

13

what the lav; is.

14

"All laws are to be read in pari materia."

15
16
17

18
19

20

We come to Article 17 which states clearly,

When one particular’provision’of the .Civil Code of
Louisiana does not clearly enunciate the lav; or if it enunciate
the law in a fashion which can be viewed as only leading to one
principle, we look to the other Code articles which emanate
from that particular system.

Article 2404.

Article 17 is the

article applying to the in pari materia rule which Is used by
civilians in interpreting

a

lav; in our jurisdiction.

21

QUESTION:

Do you want us to amply that rule to our

22

Constitution?
23

MR. SCHOENBERG:

Well, Your Honor, all 1

can say is

24

the law would be what this honorable Court would sav the law is.
25

9

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. SCHOENBERG:

3

What the Constitution says it is.
What the Constitution is

and how

this honorable Court would interpret the Constitution.
If we turn to Article 2404, we read that the husband

4

5

is the head and master of the community.

He manages the com­

6

munity, he disposes of its assets.

7

materia with Article 2334 which as originally enacted in 1962

8

-- and this is the provision that we are looking at -- stated

9

that the husband could not alienate the community immovable

We read this in pari

10

property where the woman, the wife, had filed a declaration of

1 1

homestead in the mortgage and conveyance office where the.

12

parish, where the property was situated.
2334 was then later amended in 1977 to state, that

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

community immovable property could not be alienated unless
the wife filed a declaration stating to the effect that her
consent was not required..

So we're looking

at

earlier

article 2334, valid as of 1962, valid until January 1, 1977,
and we're looking at Article 2404, and we are looking at this
law and we’re looking at October, 1977,.when these events
occurred.

And this is the system of law which

is

applied

20

at this time.
21

In my brief, Your Honors,

we

have attempted

to

22

point out the unique circumstances of Louisiana law.

We have

23

pointed to the fact that Joan Paillot Feenstra. had a remedy
24

which was a very, very easy and a very simple remedy?
25

10

1

filing the declaration of homestead.

2

The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ignored that issue

3

and immediately jumped to the fact that an antenuptial agree­

4

ment could have been entered into between the parties before

5

the marriage in which the parties would be separate in proper­

6

ty or they would not have community property, or that the

7

husband alone could not mortgage the household.

8
9

And they go into the point of transactional cause
and the great expense of retaining an attorney before entering

10

into marriage in Louisiana.

1 1

was ever needed.

12

was ever needed to remedy the situation.

13

at $300, $400, $500, although I do not ask this Court to take

14

judicial notice of the amount of attorney's fees.

15
16
17

18
19

But the fact is that no attorney

The fact is that no antenuptial agreement
We’re not looking

All we are

]ooking at is a simple declaration, a simule, simple, very
inexpensive declaration in the notarial archives of Orleans
Parish and the Custodian of the Records stating to the effect
that this community house cannot be alienated or mortgaged by
my husband without my consent.
QUESTION:

So we feel --

Isn't your relief really one directed to

20

the Court of Appeals for clarification of its judgment
21

rather than here?
22

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Wei], Your Honor, we of course

23

first address the issue of Article 2404, and that the third
24

point I did ask, does the decision apply to my client and
25

11

1

to Joan Pa.illot Feenstra in such a way as to allow my client

2

to have the house seized

3

And my feeling was that that issue was subsumed within the

4

issues that' this Court would tell us what prospectivity means

5

in this particular circumstance.
QUESTION:

6
7

Did you ask the 5th Circuit for clarifi­

cation of its judgment?
MR. SCHOENBERGER:

8
9

and sold, or does it not mean that?

We did not, Your Honor.

We did

not.
QUESTION:

10

So both of you come up here not knowing

1 1

what the judgment means.

And this is the gist of the State of

12

Louisiana's motion to dismiss, as I read it.
MR. SCHOENBERGER:

13

That there is no case or contro­

14

versy, Your Honor.

15

because the mortgage stands in Orleans Parish and

16

Mr. Kirchberg, due to the injunctions, cannot seize the house,

17

and the house is encumbered.

18
19

20
21

22

So we stand in this dilemma of

a house that's encumbered with a mortgage, without an order
saying to the seneschal

of the Parish Orleans, you are noti­

fied to seize this particular property, advertise it for sale,
and to sell the property.

And we stand in this dilemma.

It's a dilemma that both parties face.
QUESTION:

23
24

But clearly, there is a case or controversy

Well , if you got together, you could

sell it.
MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Maybe so, Your Honor.

25

12

1

2

QUESTION:

Couldn't the Supreme Court of Louisiana

solve a31 of that dilemma?

3

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes; of Louisiana, solve all of your

dilemma?

6

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

7

QUESTION:

8

down there?

title?

10

The Supreme Court, Your Honor?

I don't --

Don't you have any title-clearing cases

Can't you clear title down there?

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Clear the

13

19

20

QUESTION:

They would probably be looking to this

We would give them guidance in how to

enforce their own. statutes?
MR. SCHOENBERGER:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor --

We would give them guidance in how to

clear up a case?
MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Well, Your Honor, if an order

would proceed from this Court that Article 2404 is constitu­
tional, then clearly the house can be seized and sold, if an
order would proceed.

21

QUESTION:

That's what you want us to say?

22

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Yes, Your Honor, that article --

23

QUESTION:

I just wondered what you wanted us to do.

24

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Well, that is the first issue

25

13

1

in our1 statement of jurisdiction:

2

tutional?

And we believe that it is net.
If we

3

is Article 2404 unconsti­

were looking at a formal antenuptial agree­

4

ment, we could agree that the situation would be quite burden­

5

some.

6

fees --

But considering the smei.ll amount of fees, of filing

QUESTION:

7

Couldn’t you -- I'll nut it this way,

8

could you have just simply commenced your proceeding on the

9

assumption that the 5th Circuit meant what it seemed to have

10

said, that this was prospective only,

1 1

courts of Louisiana wrestle with that problem?

12

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

13

QUESTION:

14

17

What was there to prevent you from doing

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Well, I felt that since this case

was in the federal system that it should move up appropriately
through the federal system, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

18
19

Yes, Your Honor, except that

that after the 5th Circuit came down?

15
16

and then let the state

You're asking us to clarify something that

doesn't seem to be clear tc you and that's what it amounts to,
isn't it ?

20

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Well, Your Honor, what we are

21

saying -22

QUESTION:

You come tc us without knowing whether,

23

what the Louisiana courts would have done or whether you
24

could have proceeded with this foreclosure.
25

14

1

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Well, with the injunction, Your

2

Honor, no; that is part of the problem.

3

that the 5th Circuit opinion is clear, and that is why we

4

appealed the case.

5

QUESTION:

And we do not feel

Well, I would have thought the 5th. Circuit

6

had said that at least as between you and your opponent, the

7

mortgage was invalid.

8

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

9

QUESTION:

But it did not. say that,

They decided the case.

And a federal,

10

any federal court, including the Court of Appeals in this

1 1

case, has to decide cases before it, one way or the other.

12

And it can't give advisory opinions, and it's the very fact

13

it decided the case leads to the inference, I suppose, I would

14

suppose, that my brother Rehnquist has suggested, doesn't it?

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

22

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Except, Your Honor, that accord­

ing to Linkletter the. federal courts can apply cases prospec­
tively only, future prospectivity there is nothing -QUESTION: Even if we can do it prospectively Only ,
letter didn't say that.

Link-

But I think I know what you mean.

But in any event, a court always decides the case before it
in favor of one party or the other, and there's no indication
here that the court decided this case in your favor, is there?
MR. SCHOENBERGER:

There is no direct statement to

23

the effect that the case was decided in our favor, and there
24

is no statement to the effect that it was decided exactly in
25

15

There was no statement to the effect

1

favor of Mrs. Feenstra.

2

that the mortgage was invalid or that the mortgage --

3
4

5

QUESTION:

Well, It was either decided against yon

or it wasn't decided at all, wasn't it, in your case?
MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Unless, Your Honor, as I feel,

6

that it was decided in our favor and looked toward the future

7

from the date of December 17, IS 79, on, and that the prior

8

mortgage was valid, because if it were not valid then we would

9

be in substantia] chaos in Louisiana, because the law of the

10

1 1

12
13
14

15
16
17

18
19

case could not apply to Mr. Kirchberg alone -QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. SCHOENBERGER:
QUESTION:

-- because that would be unfair.

Why?

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Because if it applies to

Mr. Kirchberg under McDuffy v. Weil, all mortgages in Louisiana
are only valid from the date of recordation and filing, and
therefore, if the law of the 5th Circuit Is that'Article --well, obviously, the 2404 is unconstitutional.

And if it

applies to Mr. Kirchberg, it applies from 1974 on.
QUESTION:

Well, counsel, at least, however, you pre­

20

vailed in the district court before Judge Sear?
21

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

We did, Your Honor.

22

QUESTION:

And that was reversed?

23

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

That was reversed.

24

QUESTION:

Does it follow that that's a decision

25

16

1

against your client?

2
3
4

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

it was a reversal of a motion for summary judgment.

And ---

but in terms of application of that, judgment, that is another

5

problem.

6

that apply, is again unknown.

7

It would follow, Your Honor, that

And from what date, and in what circumstances would

If the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals had not said to

8

apply this case would cause substantial hardship, if applied

9

retrospectively, citing Cipriano v. City of Houma, the case in­

10

volving the propei-ty bond voting restrictions to people who

1 1

did not own property, then it would be much more clear.

12

Honor', we would --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SCKOENBERGER:

15

But the judge did cite that case.

QUESTION:

17

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

19

He did cite the case.

He did

cite the case, Your Honor, but then he said he would

18

Your

She did, isn’t it a she?
She; yes.

Your Honor, we will

reserve the rest of the time for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

Before you sit down, counsel, the state­

20

ment of jurisdiction which was prepared by your client heis what

21

looks to me like a duplication of the 5th Circuit's opinion.

22

MR. SCHOENBERGER:

23

QUESTION:

24

25

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Appellant Kirchberg in this case has apparently

10
1 1

confused what is a very simDle case before this Court, and that

12

is whether Article 2404 is a denial of equal protection and

13

whether the 5th’Circuit lower court opinion should be applied

14

to the parties litigant.
It was not until the appeal to this Court that the

issue of whether Ms.

Feenstra should be included in the hold­

an unconstitutional holding of the Article 2^ has

been raised, and it was raised by Mr. Kirchberg as an 11th
hour attempt to save his mortgage.
At the court below, at the district court, the

20

State of Louisiana and the Governor of Louisiana was included
21

as a defendant in Ms.

Feenstra's countei'claim.

They prepared

22

a brief to the 5th Circuit on appeal which stated, if the 5th
23

Circuit holds Article 2404 unconstitutioniil and if it annlies
24

its decision prospectively only, then Mrs .’' Feenstra would be the

That is
Half of

its opinion was based on the fact that there was a case or
controversy before them, and then to hold that the decision

should not be applied to Ms. Feenstra would be absolute,

This is especially so since Article 2404

operates under a communiiy property system.

The other states

cuits, so that there — it's by no means a symmetrical result
as if the 5th Circuit were the only court that were ever to

declare it unconstitutional but prospective only.

QUESTION:

Well, you may --

MS. HAUSMAN-SMITH:

I would like to point out that,

a holding, prospective-only holding in this case would also
go against the holdings in prospective cases of the Louisiana

20

Supreme Court.

The Louisiana Supreme Court in Corpus Christi

21

Parish Credit Union v. Martin did not reach the constitutional
22

issue but in a three-justice dissent they clearly said that
23

Article 2404 had to be. found constitutional, that it should be
24

applied prospective only, because of the subsequent inequity
25

22

1

that could result from a retroactive holding, but that of

2

course the parties before them should be included in that.

3

QUESTION:

Bid you say that was a dissenting opinion':

4

MS. HAUSMAN-SMITH:

That was the three-justice dis­

5

sent in Corpus Christi, Your Honor, and it is the only case law

6

where the Louisiana Supreme Court has grappled with an uncon­

7

stitutional holding of Article 2404 and come up with a solu­

8

tion as far as application to the parties, or retroactive

application.

That is correct.

But in Lake,

Inc., v. Louisiana Power £ Light, 330 So.2d 914, the Louisiana
Supreme Court did hold, make a prospective-only decision and
specifically included the parties before the case.

So they

have spoken on prospective-only and have shown their intention
to keep the parties before them.
QUESTION:

Of course they may not have the same case

18

or’ controversy requirements that the federal judicial system
19

has .
20

MS. HAUSMAN-SMITH:

Absolutely, and a case in contro­

21

versy is at the basis of the appellee’s claim that she has in­
22

cluded in the 5th Circuit.
23

I would like to point out that in appellee's motion
24

for affirmance before: this Court, in the appeal before this
25

23

1

Court, appellee pointed out that the 5th Circuit was empowered

2

to decide whether its holding prospective-only applied to the

parties litigant, and that it was not necessary for the appeal

4

to come before this Court on that issue.

there would be no way in which Mrs. Feenstra would agree to
such a moi’tgage and therefore he was merely trying to cover
his options.

There is no evidence tha.t he was relying on it.

He also

was an attorney and practicing for several

years in domestic relations work, and he was in process of
this kind of work at the tine that Labine and Frontiero were
decided, so he should have been aware of those holdings.

Louisiana, and under the statute this declaration was only
allowed to be made six months after the property was purchased;
by the v/ife.

The statute provided --

QUESTION:

Within the first six months or after the

first six months?
MS. HAUSMAN-SMITH:

After the first six months.

The first six months after the property was purchased the
State of Louisiana left those six months for the: husband to
file a declaration of family homestead, but if he neglected to

21

within those six months then they empowered the wife, so
22

potentially a husband can mortgage the property without his
23

wife's consent and the declaration would be useless to her if
24

it was done within the first six months after purchase.

QUESTION:

2

MS. HAUSMAN-SMITH:

How about an antenuptial agreement?
An antenuptial agreement was

3

possible under Louisiana law, but Appel]ee Feenstra would

4

maintain that at all points that that was not, did not cure

5

the burdens on her; that an antenuptial contract would have to

6

be signed by both the parties, and a husband therefore would

7

have to give up, be required to give up the power that

8

Louisiana had given him under the head and master principle.

9

And this is -- the wife would be seeking an antenuptial agree­

10

ment under -- it's definitely an unequal bargaining position.
QUESTION:

1 1

12

she can refuse to marry him, I suppose.
MS. HAUSMAN-SMITH:

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20

Well, if it's an antenuptial agreement,

I suppose; yes.

-- But this

declarati on merely enhances and buttresses the fact that
Mrs. Feenstra. has been discriminated against and her rights of
equal protection have been violated.

Under'Louisiana law as

it applied to her, the burdens were all on her 1:o cure a ba­
sically

unequal law, and in no sense, no matter what she did,

would she ever be able to proceed in the power that her husband
had under bead and master, and that would be having total
authority and managerial authority over the community proper­

21

ty; no matter what she did would

she be able to be in that --

22

stand in that position.
23

Appellee seems to have not created her own predica­

Yet Article 2404

And it is not until the marriage is

10

or to gain her ownership rights if no fraud was committed or

1 1

if the assets were not structured.

12

By the Louisiana’.system of choosing management by

13

the husband alone, it is definitely calling for a different

14

15
16

17

18
19

treatment of otherwise similarly situated married persons, and
this different, treatment is based on sex.

It is impossible to

view the article in any other terms but a denial of her equal
protection.

The

opt-out

provisions, the

antenuptial con­

tract, the declarations that were made, are all forms in which
she the wife must, has tlhe burden of correcting a definitely
inequitable situation, y«et the husband never has that burden.

20

The ability of'Mrs. Feenstra to declare a family home:
21

was not made light: by the 5th Circuit.

They merely pointed

22

out that she would have an additional economic and legal burden
23

and the transactional costs added to the: wite and not being

I would like to add that the power of the wife to

20
21

22

Now, how such

a article can be conceived to balance the head and master
system against her is unbelievable to me.

Fortunately, this

is also repealed and now, in Louisiana, there is a strong
community property system, a healthy, live community property
system, but without the discriminatory provisions.
The Louisiana Legislature in its wisdom has adopted a genderneutral system where both husbands and wives manage equally
their property and have avoided, and have chosen the least
discriminatory manner possible of regulating marital property
to the satisfaction of all parties.

And therefore there is

really no reason to believe that a situation of havoc or that
23

the Code has been harmed or is unhealthy s:’ tuation at this point.

Yes; a mortgage on property held

date of October, 1974, and therefore all the other mortgages

13

similarly situated after October, 1974, would be affected by

14

this holding.

So, counsel, even in community property

states which allow the husband to alienate on his own signa­
ture community property so long as it is not in fraud of the
rights of the wife, this mortgage would fail, would it not?
I mean, certainly this is in fraud of the interests of the
wife.
MR. SCHOENBERGER:

Well, Your Honor’, we did not feel

that it was in fraud of the interest of the wife.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel.

The

23

case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 12:01 o'clock p.m., the case in the
25

above-described matter was submitted.)
