MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

3

first this morning in Minnick v. California Department of

4

Corrections.

5

Mr. Yank, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD YANK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. YANK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

9

Thirty years ago was the last time this Court had

10

the opportunity in a constitutional contest to consider the

1 1

issue of reverse discrimination in employment.

12

this Court and the California Supreme Court agreed that

13

group could not force upon an employer the premise that that

14

employer had to have a particular racial composition of that

15

employer's work, force which would match the service popula­

16

tion.

17

nia.

18

339 U.S. 460.

19

and it was an attempt to have Lucky's have its store in

20

Richmond, California, have its work force mirror the racial

21

composition of the people who shop there, in Richmond,

22

California.

23
24

25

At that time
a.

Then too the Court was looking at a. case from Califor­
The case wa.s Hughes v. Superior Court of California,
And at that time the employer was Lucky Stores,

And this Court, and the California Supreme Court,
sustained a permanent injunction declaring at that time that
such a goal of requiring such mirroring was an unlawful
3

1

2

purpose as articulated under California lav;.

Why, then, 30

years later are we back?

3

The reason that we are back obviously has to do wi1h

4

the intei'vening events of the past decades , intervening strug­

5

gles that counsel on both sides of the case here agree with,

6

and support.

7

vening years, of these intervening decades, has been a strategy

8

of how to indeed achieve the results we all want tc see, which

9

is to see people judged without regard to their race

10

1 1

What has come out of the struggles of the inter­

or color

but simply with regard to their abilities.
Before you is a strategy of how to get there which

12

petitioners feel in fact is a step a.way from the society, from

13

the goals that we all want to see.

14

the result of a strategy of social engineering wherein the

15

California Department of Corrections has attempted to have i.ts

16

work force mirror racially the inmate population or service

17

population of the Department.

18

What we have before you is

Justice Skelly Wright in a recent Law Review article

19

in the University of Chicago Law Review has challenged those

20

of us who oppose reverse discrimination saying that we talk in

21

only abstract principles, but we don't get down to talking

22
23
24

25

about social realities and, indeed, the facts.

I want to take

on that challenge and speak of the facts of this case.
The case before you is not about remedying prior
discrimination.

That is not this case.

In 1974

when the

1

Department, adopted ii s affirmative action program and then

2

started to carry it out as we had described, in fact, black

3

persons were over-represented in the work force of the Depart­

4

ment of Corrections, as were orientals and as were people

5

who would be called "others."

6

force.

This was not a. lily-white work

This was indeed an integrated work force.

7

There has never been the slightest hint in the

8

record that there was not already sufficient minorities and

9

women throughout the Department to handle any sorts of pecu­

10

liar or specialized assignments that the Department somehow

1 1

requires.

12

The program here was carried out r.ot by low-level

13

people who somehow misunderstood the goals and objectives of

14

the Department.

15

indeed the energetic behest of ton management.

QUESTION:

Mr. Yank, may I ask you, this case in­

MR. YANK:

Absolutely wrong, Your Honor.

nitely involves new hires.

QUESTION:

Well, in the cases of Minnick and Darden?

2

MR. YANK:

They were promotional people.

3

QUESTION:

And it's only their cases that we have?

4

MR. YANK:

No, because in fact this action was

5

brought on behalf, as a class action, of all people similarly

6

situated by both Minnick, Darden, and by the Association.

7

And indeed, the evidence was voluminous that the policies

8

being implemented went also to the question of hiring.

9

For example, people who applied for jobs had their

10

races secretly coded on their application forms at the behest

11

of the Department.

12

favored group literally were not considered for certain posi­

13

tions .

7

that neither had been eligible for promotion?

8

MR. YANK:

9

and I do quarrel --

10

QUESTION:

I'm not asking that.

1 1

MR. YANK:

I do quarrel with the notion, "eligible."

12

QUESTION:

Well, are we tc take this -- this is what

14

They/ were not in the ton three bands,

your state court saidMR. YANK:

Are we to go behind that?

They/ were not reachable within the rule- •

15

of-three at the time.

16

be the thrust of your question, the program that was described

17

here was one that was going on statewide and was going on and

18

will continue tc go on in the future. Minnick and Darden will

19

be seeking other promotions, as will Caucasians and males

20

throughout the rest of the Department.

21

However, moving on to what I gather to

This case was brought, not dealing with just those

22

two promotions, but there was evidence dealing with promotions

23

on a statewide basis at all kinds of levels, and not only --

24

25

•

And the finding's of fact: in the trial court specifically state
that Minnick and Darden as to future promotions will be

7

1

2
3

disadvantaged, and that Caucasians and males in general
throughout the Department will be disadvantaged with regard to
future promotions.

4

Furthermore, the organization, CCOA itself, clearly

5

has standing to bring this action on behalf of any of its

6

members threatened with future or prospective injury as the

7

result of the: actions of the Department.

8
9

This suit, really, Your Honor, was one seeking pros­
pective injunctive relief.

We never sought to void a past

10

appointment of any person, figuring that they in one way were

1 1

innocent victims of the Department's policies as well as Cau­

12

casians.

13

Minnick, Darden, and the Association clearly had that standing.

14

We also had, I think, five plaintiffs --

15
16

We were seeking prospective injunctive relief.

QUESTION:

They had that standing even if they had

no -- were, in any event, not eligible for promotion?

17

MR. YANK:

The trial court found that they --

18

QUESTION:

I don't care what the trial court found.

19

20

The appellate -- it's its decision we have before us, isn't it?
MR. YANK:

As to any future promotions, I don't be­

21

lieve that the appellate court denies that they might be seek­

22

ing future promotion.

23

trial court, which had plenty of substantial evidence to sup­

24

port them, should have been binding upon the Court cf Appeal

25

and any appellate court.

The specific findings of fact to the

And it's those findings, I think,
8

1

to which we must look.

2

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Yank, you’re not suggesting

3

that for federal case or controversy purposes in this Court

4

that we have jurisdiction to accord standing, or we ordinarily

5

accord standing to an association qua an association simply

6

because some of its unnamed members may have been injured by a

7

particular act?
MR. YANK:

8
9

10

Why, I am suggesting that this Court in

the past has imbued, articulated precisely that rule.
v.

In ’Ward

Sullivan for example, this Court stated that an employee

11

organization or an association may bring an action if it can

12

show that any one of its members suffered damage, or any one

13

of its members himself

14

the Court to bring the action.

15

clear from this record it's that this is indeed a case in

16

controversy.

herself would have standing before
If there's anything that’s

We could have had correctional officers taking

in and testify.

We had five people who testified who said

that they were willing to have the complaint be amended

to

name them specifically as plaintiffs.
I do believe that CCOA alone, had it brought the

21
22

or

case, would meet the standards of case or controvery as
articulated by this Court in Ward v.

Sullivan and also Ali v.

Medrano.
QUESTION:

How about NAACP v. Alabama? It goes back
9

1

to that, doesn't it?

2

MR. YANK:

I would think it is.

QUESTION:

Perhaps you're right, Mr. Yank, but the

4

Court of Appeal in California left open that question, didn't

6

paragraph of the opinion it says that you couldn't confer

7

standing by stipulation, and that was a question to be opened on

8

remand, so we really don't know the facts yet.

MR. YANK:

Is that correct?

facts.

QUESTION:

No, but we have to decide a lawsuit. And

as I understand it, there is no class action certified here.

3

MR. YANK:

That's correct.

4

QUESTION:

We only have two individuals and an

5

association, and the: individuals have not been harmed according;

6

to what Mr. Justice Brennan read, and the association's stand­

7

ing is in doubt, based on the last sentence of the opinion.

8
9

10

MR. YANK:

Well, again, I think that it’s a matter

for this Court to determine whether, under your standards,
there is indeed a justiciable issue here.
QUESTION:

11

Even if it's justiciable in a federal

12

sense, would i1

And this is a state proceeding.
MR. YANK:

I think again, it's clear under the

California case: -QUESTION:

We have to decide that though, don't we?

17

The California question of whether their standing is a matter

18

of state law.

19

MR. YANK:

I don't --

QUESTION:

It's rather unusual for us to decide

that kind of state law issue.

No, again, we're here cinder the 14th

We could be -- I believe the standards that apply

here are. not the sta.te court's standards concerning standing

11

1

QUESTION:

Well, but if you don't rely on a state

2

court, you can never get here, and they’ve said, we don't know

3

whether you belong in a state court.

4

MR. YANK:

Wei], that is what the Court of Appeal

5

said without briefing, but I do think that the cases, the

6

California cases that we cited --

7

QUESTION:

Well, but, assuming you're right, we have

8

to decide, that question of California law under your view of

9

the case.

10

MR. YANK:

Could be, but it does not require any re­

1 1

mand, because the facts concerning the standing are there.

12

So you may indeed want to review the California cases that

13

we've brought to the Court's attention.
QUESTION:

14

Isn't it possible that the trial court

15

when this case goes back, if it goes back, would decide theire

16

is no sta.ndi.ng, or would decide that there is no jurisdiction?
MR. YANK:

17

18

I don't see. how that could be possible.

One, again, I --

19

QUESTION:

Well, they're, free to do it, are they not?

20

MR. YANK:

CCOA would have it.

But, number twfo,

21

if necessary, we could have brought in dozens of people beyond

22

the five witnesses who were not named claimants who said --

QUESTION:

6

Mr. Yank, I'm bothered by something else.

Your attack here is on the 1974 affirmative action plan, isn't

8

it?

9

MR. YANK

It really is not an attack on the --

ment, subsequent,

There is no

And indeed, the Depart­

for example, to the preliminary injunction

in the case, went out and violated the order of the court.
And, of course, as you know, there was literally a hearing as
to whether the Department and its top officials should be held
in contempt.

The; text of the program is not on its face

unconstitutional.

It is that program as amended in '75 and

again in '79, as implemented, that we are attacking here.
25

13

1

2

QUESTION:

Well, is the '79 plan, or emended in '79,

is that in the record?

3

MR. YANK:

It's lodged with this Court.

4

QUESTION:

Is it in the record?

5

MR. YANK:

No, because the trial occurred prior

6

thereto.

I would agree that this Court has before it a par­

QUESTION:

This

I suggest that you have before

Well, let me ask one other question then.

Does the plan as amended in '75 and '79 differ in any material
respects from the '74 plan origina.lly under a.ttack?
MR. YANK:

Not a bit.

And indeed, they rea-ffirm,

they reaffirm explicitly that even though LEAA changed its
regs. so as to not set as goals the "service population," none­
theless the California Department of Corrections reaffirmed
that it was having as its goals the inmate population.
14

1

So, if anything, it's more emphatic as to what the social

2

engineering goals of this plan are as we stand and sit here

3

today.

4

In the record in this case, obviously the Court is

5

familiar with the explicit set-aside, and the fact that out

6

of the mouths of the Department's only witnesses, the Depart­

7

ment acknowledged that it was hiring, was promoting lesser

8

qualified people.

9

within a reasonable range of qualifications, no matter whether

The burden shifted to the defendants to prove that without

Actually, however, if it had come up

through the courts of Virginia -- I have some difficulty re­
membering

whether that was the case for illegal practice of

law7 or not -- then, if we held it had standing, it would be a
federal holding.
MR. YANK:

Actually, I think I'm incorrect on that.

I believe that, indeed, this Court

in examining federal stat­

utes has mandated that state courts indeed provide a cause of
action under federal statutes, and indeed, in a brief of the
Solicitor General, the Michigan Law Review -- I think it's

The De-

race and sex were not the only factor's, and then quoting, said
"Plaintiffs on the other hand assert that the hiring or
promotion of a person based in whole or in part on sex or
racial background or ancestry is unconstitutional and void.
The Court agrees with plaintiffs."
And the court went on, then, to enter an injunction,
which is Appendix G to the petition, which prohibited the

based on race, color, sex, or national origin in hiring or

And until those questions to which I'll come in a

or will not grant Petitioners the relief they seek on their
federal grounds.

And I think that is the important, point

which I'd like to stress insofar as the law is concerned.
It is true, of course, that this Court in recent
years has expanded somewhat on earlier definitions of what con­
stitutes a final judgment.

There are, for example, decisions

of this Court indicating that a decision may be final, where a.

QUESTION:

The finding is supportecL

Let me try it out in this way.

Is the

11

trial court free in the light of the Court of Appeal's holding

12

to decide that race and these other factors may not be used

13

at al], may not be used as a plus factor or may not enter

14

into the decision?

15

MR. POLLAK:

No, Your Honor,

only with respect to

16

that limited question has there been a determination that is

17

conclusive by the Court of Appeal.

18

for further consideration under the Court of Appeal's opinion

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

The question that remains

is whether or not the Department's plan is sufficiently
tailored to accomplish that objective in a permissible manner.
And on remand, it will be free to the petitioners to offer
evidence and to squarely address this issue which, I repeat,
has never been addressed in the state courts, of whether or
not the goals go beyond what is necessary to achieve the state
interest in orderly prison administration.
35

And at the same time the Department will have the
opportunity to offer evidence addressed to that very question.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Pol.lak, you wouldn't suggest

that your chances of losing this case are very high after the;

Court of Appeal's opinion, would you?

MR. POLLAK:

Your Honor, I submit -- perhaps I'm not

making myself clear -- I acknowledge --QUESTION: Of course, if I'm right, it just means that
you would rather be here maybe next term than this term?
MR. POLLAK:

No, Your Honor, that is not the point,

and I don't think that's the case.
QUESTION:

Let me read you this sentence from Find­

13

ing 19 which

14

cited as being at F6, where the court says, "Because of the

15

conditions and circumstances within California prisons and

16

throughout the Department of Corrections in making job assign­

17

ments and in determining employment responsibilities, it is

18

the compelling state interest in promoting the safety of cor­

and efficient prison management."
Now, certainly that much has been decided, has

MR. POLLAK:

Yes, Your Honor, that it is permissible

to consider these factors.

5

whether or not the Department is giving too much consideration,

6

consideration which exceeds what would be permissible under

7

the Equal Protection Clause.

QUESTION:

9

the Superior Court?
MR. POLLAK:

10

What has not been decided and what

Well, why did the Court of Appeal reverse

I confess, Your Honor, that it's not --

1 1

why they reversed it was because the Superior Court had reached

12

a decision which had said you can't consider race or sex at

13

all.

14

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. POLLAK:

No, they said it could be considered

in making job assignments.

And what the court was, what the

Superior Court was doing was distinguishing job assignments
from promotions, and hiring.
QUESTION:

You mean by that that they could assign

women to the women's ward or the: women's institution?
MR. POLLAK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Or that

But, Your Honor, the petitioners do

v/ish to argue, and are arguing to this Court, that the
Department's program does go further' than is necessary to
accomplish this objective.

They do argue that the program is

excessive because the goals are mor excessive than necessary.
That is an issue (a) which has never been considered in the
state courts, and (b) which will be open to the presentation
of evidence when this case is remanded.

MR.

POLLAK:

Because --

I don't know

I believe what is included

15

in the: issue that the petitioners are trying to have this Court:

necessary to go so far as tc have goals which seek to achieve

is something that we have not considered below, and as to which
we have never offered any evidence.
