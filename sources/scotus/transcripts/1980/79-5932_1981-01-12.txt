MR.' CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Myers, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY A. MYERS, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR. MYERS:

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This is an appeal by two parents, John Doe and Jane

9

10

Roe, from a final decision of the Delaware Supreme Court.

By

11

this appeal they seek to overturn lower court orders which

12

permanently and irrevocably terminated all of their relation­

13

ships with their five children.

14

QUESTION:

Do they want the children back, Mr. Myers?

15

MR. MYERS:

The parents -- if this order was vacated

16

at this time, custody would still remain within the State.

17

Hopefully we could meet with representatives of the State,

18

19

establish visitation with these children, with the eventual
goal of the mother regaining them in her custody.

the mother to have custody and allow him to have reasonable

the children.

MR. MYERS:

It is

In the words of the Dela­

ware statute, its sole purpose is "to make parents and the
children as if they were and have always been strangers."
It's in effect a death penalty for the family.
This appeal raises three questions against the TPR

QUESTION:

When it ends the relationship with the

2

parents I gather it has the same effect as an adoption,

3

doesn't it?

4

5

MR.

MYERS:

Well,

a TPR does not necessarily lead to

an adoption.

6

QUESTION:

No, but in terms of termination of any

7

relationship of parent and child, doesn't it have the same

8

effect as an adoption?

MYERS:

As to the parent, it makes him a stran­

there's going to be a replacement.

12

raises three questions against the termination order below.

13

The first question is whether the statutory standards used to

14

break up this family were unconstitutionally vague.

15

standard is whether the State could proceed to break up this

16

family in a judicial proceeding using a mere preponderance of

17

20
21

22
23
24

It doesn't necessarily guarantee to the child that

the evidence standard.

As I said, this appeal

The second

The third standard is whether the

State could break up this family without demonstrating that
any of the conduct alleged against these parents had caused
any actual,

substantial harm to the children.

Briefly stated, the facts of the case were these.
John Doe and Jane Roe were half-brother and sister, and begin­
ning in the 1970s they lived together and had five children.
The Delaware State Welfare Agency, the Division of Social Ser­
vices, knew about Mr.

and Mrs.

Doe's relationship since 1972,

25

6

1

and had previously indicated to them that that relationship

2

would not be a factor that the Division would consider about

3

them raising their children.

4

from the Division went to the local Attorney General, the

5

attorney that advised them.

6

so long as there were children in the Doe home, they would

7

not be able to prove the Does were unfit parents and would not

8

be able to get a termination of parental rights.

However, in early 1975 workers

Once they were charged with that,

That plan of action by the Division was
Within a week after the meeting the Attorney

General brought a criminal charge of incest against the
parents.

The parents were incarcerated in default of a $1,000

bond for 19 days.

Given their absence, the Division of Social

Service was in effect given temporary custody of the children.
Subsequently, the parents were convicted of the criminal
charge of incest, a misdemeanor in Delaware, and permanent
custody of the children was given to the Division.
What's important to note about the incest conviction
is that, as the parents testified, after the conviction of the
misdemeanor they were told by the presiding judge that

25

7

1

presided at that trial that if they underwent sterilization

2

that would be a substantial factor in them regaining their

3

children.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. MYERS:

And did they?
Yes, they did.

Anxious to get their

6

children back, and relying on that advice, they underwent

7

sterilization.

8

tion the Division told them that they were going to terminate

9

all their parental rights.
QUESTION:

It's totally irrelevant.

Did the judge

pay for the sterilization procedures?

12

MR. MYERS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MYERS:

15

The Division --

Yes, he did.
Has he ever been reimbursed?
I don't believe so.

The record doesn't

reflect that, but to my knowledge he wasn't.
The Division then filed the termination of parental

16

17

rights proceeding.

18

provision was a former Delaware provision which allowed the

19

20

21
22
23
24

25

The statute under which they based that

termination if the parents were not fitted to continue to exer­
cise parental rights.

That short phrase was the sum extent

of the statutory definition of when a termination could go
forward.
In its original petition the Division alleged that
the not-fitted conduct sufficient to trigger the statute was
their half-brother and half-sister relationship.
8

It's this

1

conduct that the Division had known about for almost three

2

years and had in fact told them in the past that it wasn't

3

going to be used against them.

4

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Myers, in reading the opinion

5

of the Delaware Supreme Court at page 199 of Atlantic, 2d,

6

the Court says that "under our statute there must also be a

7

finding that the termination of parental rights is in the

8

best interest of the child," indicating that parental unfitness

9

is not by itself sufficient.

10

MR. MYERS:

Well, we contend also that "best inter­

1 1

est" is just as vague as "not fitted" language.

12

ing criteria to get to "best interest" is in effect the

13

"not fitted" standard.

14

fitted," I don't think that "best interest" as a matter of

15

State law comes into play.

16

the Supreme Court emphatically stated that the half-brother -

17

half-sister relationship was the disqualifying, triggering

And both the Superior Court and

criterion of "not fitted."
QUESTION:

Well, but, it wouldn't have been suffi­

cient, as I read the Delaware Supreme Court opinion.
MR. MYERS:

It's a precondition.

If in effect the

precondition has been met, then it would have to go into
"best interest."

I think this opinion points out exactly

the limited scope the Delaware Supreme Court has read into the
term "best interest."

I think that the phrase itself is a
9

1

comparative phrase and it requires looking at all the elements

2

concerning the child.

Mr. Myers, do you agree or what is your

8

view on whether the issues are the same for the mother and the

9

father?

Now, the reason I ask that, there's the evidence of

-offensive touching as to the father and the alcoholism

12

13

places and presumably it would make a difference as to which

14

parent had the contact with the child.

15

if the order is proper as to one parent, it's proper as to

16

both?
MR. MYERS:

QUESTION:

issue as to both?

19

20

But now the parents are in different

Yes, I think -- again, there's no con­

duct on behalf of either parent, particularly the mother, but
even to the father's conduct, there's no conduct on his part
which was shown that any of that conduct caused harm to his
children.
10

1

QUESTION:

I understand on your harm argument, but

2

on the best interests of the child argument, nerhaps now that

3

they're separated there's at least an arguable basis for

4

drawing a distinction between the two?

5

MR. MYERS:

Well, I think the best interests --

6

QUESTION:

In fact, are their interests entirely

7

parallel?

8

but it seems to me if one were reuresenting the mother sepa-1

9

rately perhaps the mother could make some arguments the father

10

Are they the same?

I know you represent them both,

can't make.
MR. MYERS:

11

Well, I think once the order terminating

12

both of their parental rights, in effect giving their children

13

to strangers, is vacated, then in effect those interests, the

14

State courts may have to adjudicate those interests if they

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

decide they conflict.

My discussions with the parents at this

point is that they don't seem to conflict.

She is more than

willing to have custody and he is willing to have that.

She

is more than willing to allow him to have visitation, given
the distance he is away, and she's more than willing to allow
that.

That's the discussions we've had.
QUESTION:

Well, when did the change of circumstance

take place in these proceedings?
MR. MYERS:
QUESTION:
MR. MYERS:

When did they separate?
Yes, when did they separate -- ?

QUESTION:

Well, I would have supposed you might

9

wouldn't you?

Just on parental termination, because you're

10

not asking, you're not objecting bight now to the change of

1 1

custody.

12

MR. MYERS:

The parents aren't seeking if this order

13

would be overturned to get their children back, given the pas­

14

sage of time, the next day.

QUESTION:
MR. MYERS:

No.
They want to regain contact with the

children and work towards

eventually having them reintegrated

MR. MYERS:

That's correct; as a starting point.

An appeal was then taken to the Delaware Supreme
The Delaware Supreme Court did not reach any of the

"best interests."

A five-day trial was held in the trial

court and as I indicated, although, the term "best interests"
seems to mandate some sort of comparative analysis, the trial
court and the State resisted any efforts by the parents to
show what type of care the children were receiving while they
were in the State's custody.

What information did leak

through is that the oldest child had been, during her period,
21

while she was in the State's custody, had been shuffled back
22

and forth between nine different foster care placements.
23

At the end of that the trial court entered a final judgment
24

indicating that it found it was in the best interests of the
25

children to terminate their parental rights, based on several

factors.

QUESTION:

Mr. Myers, is it part of your position

that a state may not ever terminate parental rights?
MR. MYERS:

We think that the only interest that the

State can assert in a termination of parental rights that's so
compelling is prevention of actual substantial or imminent
harm to the children.

Any less intrusion without proving

25

15

1

that is not permissible.

QUESTION:

I just wanted to know, do I have to get a

degree in psychiatry to decide the case?
MR. MYERS:

Well, I think the trial courts decide

these types of issues every day and it's not difficult to
show those types of actual harm.
QUESTION: Then you think also that the criteria for
termination have to be spelled out in some detail, I take it?
MR. MYERS:

I think that the appropriate way for

state legislatures to go in this field is, in effect, to spell
out the criteria of harm.
QUESTION:

Well, appropriate isn't really what I had

in mind, because we are dealing with a constitutional question
20

You think the states are required to list factors?
21

MR. MYERS:

I think that's required so that individ­

22

ual social workers or judges don't in effect define within
23

vague statutes what their own ideas of good parenting or bad
24

parenting are.

It's a legislative choice and the legislature

25

16

1

should set those criteria.
QUESTION:

2

Well, is the issue the welfare of the

3

children, the interests of the

4

or bad parenting?
MR. MYERS:

5

children, not good parenting

I think that's why the legislature should

6

look to harm to the children rather than trying to detail any

7

right or wrong parent.

8

they're in effect looking to the welfare of the children.
QUESTION:

9

If there's any harm to children

So you don't really -- you don't really

10

say that the welfare of the children is necessarily an insuffi­

1 1

cient standard. I'f a state happened to construe that standard

12

as requiring some showing of injury to the children, you

13

wouldn't have any objection to it.
MR. MYERS:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

MR. MYERS:

21

22

I said

A construction that would limit welfare

to harm, I think, would be constitutional.
QUESTION:

19

20

No, I'm not saying legislature.

the state court construed it that way.

17
18

If the legislature defined the welfare

Or in any specific case, if in applying

the welfare of the children standard as a matter of fact they
found that there was harm to the children?

I don't know how

you'd -MR. MYERS:

If the harm was in effect actual harm or

23
24

imminent threat of actual harm, whether that be psychological
or physical.

The problem with dealing with it on a case-to-cas o

25

17

]

basis without any criteria of what the legislature has de­

2

nominated as harmful is that that's an easy way for judges in

3

effect to impose their own values.

Are you saying that it would not

Well, I think that any of the criteria

that the trial court lists, frequent moves of the family,
the half-brother and half-sister relationship, would not sup­
port a finding of sufficient harm for them to in effect per­
manently break up this family.

The moving of a family as

of American families, I believe.

a scintilla

of evidence in this record concerning the half-brother - halfsister relationship which showed that that caused any harm to
these children who were already in existence.

The experts

brought forth by the State who generally had never seen the

There's no explicit grounds in Delaware

My personal opinion?
Yes .
In the absence of showing any of the

types of harm I've outlined before, I'm not sure that the
State had any reason to take children from both of these
parents.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose a state has murder as a

misdemeanor, would a home of husband, mother and father

QUESTION:

Well, haven't courts run into problems

before when they have attempted to lay down very definite

criteria such as Justice Holmes in the earlier days of rail­

14

roads, when he said, we declare it to be negligent as a matter

15

of law when you come to a railway crossing and fail to obey

25

Justice Harlan referred to the Royal Commission

Report saying that it had just proved impossible, virtually,
to define the standards that made one subject to capital
punishment, that there's necessarily an element of vagueness
there*

Negligence embraces so many situations in the tort

field that I don't think any court today says that it's vague
because all we require is negligence and the jury deliberates
as to what is negligent and what is not.
MR. MYERS:

Well, I think my response would be

business, where there may be accepted standards outside the

law, is a lot different than when a state tries to interfere

5

in a family, something this Court has recognized as a funda­

6

mental interest to both the parents and the children.

Secondly, I would point out that while we're not asking for

absolute certainty, the Delaware statute used against these

parents without any statutory definition, without any narrow

the types of factors the jury would

That's what basically, as we've pointed out the

examples in the appendix to our brief, and some of the amici
point out, that that would be the proper way for the courts to
go about this procedure, not try to detail and outline every
type of conduct a parent can or cannot do, but in effect
delineate the types of harm that will be sufficient and will
allow judges to decide whether in effect parental rights
should be forever forfeit.

QUESTION:

Well, if the Delaware Legislature should

2

say that a mother and father who were living in an incestuous

relationship are unfitted as parents and that that alone is

ground for termination of the parental rights, that would cer­

tainly eliminate the vagueness problem.

6

MR. MYERS:

That's correct.

Recently in Addington v. Texas this Court has outlined

ance of evidence, and to apply the Addington criteria of loss
of liberty, stigmatization, and the possibility of decisions

But at the time of the termination

the now-repealed statute was the one that governed.

QUESTION:

Well, then, why shouldn't -- in a case

And why should we pass on the constitutionality of a statute

MS. SMALL:

only to

my practical

8

answer that it will be several more years before there can

be permanent placement for these children.

10

1 1

The State thinks

that that would be travesty.
Delaware's termination of parental rights statute,

12

the TPR statute, is not,- as counsel suggests, unique.

13

of no state which doesn't have a similar statutory Drovision.

14

In fact, in appellants' brief at page 32, notes 52 and 53, in

15

making their standard of proof argument, the appellants list a

16

number of states that use the clear and convincing evidence

17

standard of proof in termination of parental rights standards,

19

20

21
22
23
24

parental rights acts.

We know

So I would assume that they will con­

cede that there are other TPR statutes.

In fact, Delaware was

in the forefront of having statutes which require both the
best interest and the fitness of the parents to be considered
with the Cline case in 1967,

the very standards which this

Court has alluded to in both Offer 'and in Kilwarren.

From that time on the relationships between the

policy is to maintain the family unit whenever possible, and

of the parents to be able to provide the nurturing stable en­

It could have been done.

placements, including with her own family, in her entire life
till today.

But that's not on the record.

The evidence,

though, that is on the record that is alluded to to support
nine placements does not support nine placements.

2

QUESTION:

Ms. Small, I'd be interested in your

3

discussion of the constitutional issues that I thought we took

4

this case to consider.
MS. SMALL:

5

There is, we believe, before the Court

6

one properly raised constitutional issue and that's the attack

7

on the former Delaware statute for vagueness.

8

and the rationale for a vagueness standard is that the State

9

in enacting legislation which affects individuals should put

The standard

10

the reasonable man on notice as to what conduct is prohibited

1 1

so that he may act accordingly and so that in applying such

12

standards the courts may determine without a discriminatory

13

or standardless application whether the statute is in force.

14

We think that the former Delaware statute survives an attack

15

16

ferable draftsmanship.

17

18

on its face, through narrowing interpretations of the Delaware

19

courts.

20

21

void-for-vague.

24

25

The question is whether it meets the

The statute says that parental rights may be termi­

nated when one is considered not fitted to exercise parental
duties.
That seems to me to be -- and to the Delaware courts

22
23

It is not a question of what's pre­

-- to be a standard that is comprehensible by the ordinary
person:

care, feeding, clothing, providing for the emotional

needs, and the need to stay in out of the rain.
40

Plaintiffs

1

submit that there are no slide rule calculations for deter­

2

mining what’s a statute which would survive the void-for-

3

vagueness attack, and as the amici agree, there should be

4

in the case of child custody some flexibility for determining

5

the statutes.

6

in referring to the dictionary definition has suggested that

7

the statute is on its face sufficient to give standards.

8

if it's not the Delaware courts have over the years inter­

9

preted the statute so that any reasonable person ought to know

10

As I say, I think the Delaware Supreme Court

Even

what conduct is proscribed.
QUESTION:

1 1

Now, Mrs. Small, you said that you though-:

12

that only one constitutional issue is proDerly here.

Counsel

13

for the appellants says that three constitutional issues are

14

properly here.

15

here?

Why do you think the others are not properly

16

MS. SMALL:

17

QUESTION:

The question -I.e. , the burden, of proof, and the sub­

18

stantive due process standard, as he calls it, that any state

19

need establish that there be harm to the children before it

can terminate the parents’ relationship.
MS. SMALL:

As to the latter, Justice Stewart, it

was not raised in the Delaware Supreme Court until -QUESTION:
MS. SMALL:

How about the second one?
-- until motion for reargument.

As to

the former, the argument in the Delaware Supreme Court was
41

1

that the standard of proof was to be beyond a reasonable doubt.

2

Appellants correctly point out in their ,reply brief that they

3

make reference to the Addington case in their reply brief in

4

the Delaware Supreme Court and in their motion for reargument.

5

But they do not discuss the context in which that reference

6

was made.

7

With respect to the burden of proof issue, Addington

8

is cited in their reply brief in the Delaware Supreme Court

9

directly after the positive statement that the standard of

10

proof in this case must be beyond a reasonable doubt.

1 1

QUESTION:

12

MS. SMALL:

QUESTION:

Well, in any event, you concede that -The case was cited.

This has

and it certainly seems to me that the standard under the new
statute, which is best interests of the children, is surely
quite different from the standard under the old statute of

And my question to you is this, in Bell and

Maryland, where we vacated a state Court of Appeals of Mary­
land judgment and remanded for reconsideration in light of new
42

1

law in the

3

Hughes stated the following, and my question to you is, why

isn't this statement applicable in this case?

State of Maryland, we relied on Patterson and

Chief Justice Hughes said, "We have frequently held

6

that in the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction we have

7

power not only to correct error in the judgment under review

8

but to make such disposition of the case as justice requires.

And in determining what justice does require, the Court is

10

bound to consider any change either in fact or in law which

11

has supervened since the judgment was entered.

We have said that to do this is not

having a bearing upon the right disposition of the case."
MS. SMALL:
Justice Brennan.

Well, my answer suggests two things,

First, the change in the statute enacted

this summer does not add the best interests standard.

That

has been a standard by statute or by court decisions since
before 1967.

The change was in the phraseology respecting

fitted or not fitted.
To answer, I think, the thrust of your real question

now, I can only suggest that the new statute is presently

under constitutional attack for the same reasons in the

Delaware state courts and it's likely that --

15

MS. SMALL:

Well, I think it’s fair to say that even

16

the appellants would agree that the new statute, although

17

they won’t concede it’s constitutionally acceptable, is better

18

than the old statute and that the Delaware Supreme Court did

19

not find the old statute vague, and for a determination of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY A. MYERS, ESQ.,
16

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS -- REBUTTAL
17

MR. MYERS:

Well, at this point, concerning the

18

remand question, I think the remand question and the questions
19

we've been posed concerning the vagueness issues, regardless
20

of the change in the statutory language of the new section,
21

I think the other two constitutional issues which we raised
22

are properly before the Court and would have to be decided
23

regardless of any remand.
24

QUESTION:
25

Well, the whole point, I gather, of Chief

Justice Hughes' statement in the Patterson case, and it's been
45

1

followed in a great many others, including 3ell and Maryland

2

where it was quoted, is that this Court ought not determine

3

constitutional questions if perhaps they will disappear on

4

reconsideration under the new law.

5

MR. MYERS:

Well, I think that the standard of proof

6

argument is not going to disappear, and a remand may entail

7

another evidentiary hearing and to allow it to go forward

8

under what we contend is an impermissible standard of proof

9

should not be --

QUESTION:

MR. MYERS:

15

Well, that may be so, but you may win.
Well, I think the lower courts need

some instructions.
QUESTION:

You may win, and then we may never have

to decide the question.
MR. MYERS:

And again, I would point out as to the

16

substantive due process, I think it's before this .Court be­

17

cause I think the Delaware court

18

what few there are, has indicated that it's not going to re­

QUESTION:

in this case and other cases

Mr. Myers, under your view of the law,

if there were a remand and a new hearing, what would the issue
be at the hearing, whether the parents are presently unfit or
whether they were unfit in 1976?
MR. MYERS:

I think in fairness to the parents it

would be whether they presently meet whatever statutory
46

1

requirements the state courts would apply.

QUESTION:

And under the present law.

QUESTION:.

Under the present law.

quite different than they were five years ago.

law.
