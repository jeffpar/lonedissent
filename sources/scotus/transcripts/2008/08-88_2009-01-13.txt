CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

argument next in Case 08-88, Vermont v. Brillon.

5

Ms. Rainville.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA RAINVILLE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MS. RAINVILLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
There are many reasons to reverse the

11

Vermont Supreme Court in this case.

12

by addressing four reasons as a matter of law that do

13

not require the Court to -- to review the record.

14

first is, even if we assume that the public defender is

15

an assigned counsel -- and for the purposes of argument,

16

I am just going to use the term "public defender."

17

we assume that public defenders do little or nothing in

18

a case, one cannot have a rule that that time is

19

chargeable under the speedy trial right to the State

20

because to do so creates chaos of constitutional

21

proportions in the criminal justice system.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I am going to begin

The

If

May I ask you a question

23

that goes at least to one possible application of -- of

24

your argument?

25

position that you just took, would -- would apply to the

Your argument for the State, the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

period of time, as I understand it, in which the

2

individual named, the defender named Sleigh, had been

3

appointed to -- to represent the defendant.

4

And as I understand it, when this case was

5

argued in the Supreme Court of Vermont, the State

6

conceded that, in fact, some prejudice should be

7

attributed and it should be held against the State that

8

Sleigh in effect did nothing.

9

hold it against us quite as much as you might, but, in

10

They said, well, don't

any case, that can be held against us.

11

Here you don't take that position, and I --

12

I don't know whether it's open to you -- it seems to me

13

that it's not open to you -- to take a different

14

position with respect to Sleigh here than the Attorney

15

General of Vermont did when it was before the Supreme

16

Court of Vermont.

17

just see it differently from the way the Attorney

18

General did.

19

the position that the State took and tell me why you can

20

take a different position here?

21

And I -- I have to assume that you

But would -- would you comment on -- on

MS. RAINVILLE:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

The

22

State did take the position that the eight-month period,

23

which included the four months where Attorney Sleigh was

24

involved, was a neutral factor.

25

Barker, that would allow the Court to apply it against

And under the dicta in

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the State, although not to weigh it heavily as a -- as a

2

neutral factor.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

MS. RAINVILLE:

Yes.
That was dicta in Barker,

5

but controlling to the Vermont Supreme Court.

6

this Court, however, on these facts -

7
8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MS. RAINVILLE:

It was conceded that it was

a neutral time period.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MS. RAINVILLE:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

But it was conceded, wasn't

it, in the -- in the Vermont Supreme Court?

9
10

Before

Yes.
And -- and Well, then, why isn't that

concession binding here?

15

MS. RAINVILLE:

I think it -- it may be

16

binding if the Court determines it's binding.

17

don't think it should be binding because this Court is

18

considering policy that's going to affect all States and

19

all courts.

20

National Governors Association, for example, as to

21

whether public defenders can be State actors -- and the

22

law is clear that they cannot -- that's an important

23

issue.

24
25

But I

And the issue that was raised by the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it is, but that is

not an issue that is necessarily implied by the -- by
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the concession that the Attorney General made in the

2

Vermont Supreme Court.

3

MS. RAINVILLE:

Yes.

Yes, but also if you

4

look at the record, the three years of delay, the time

5

period involving Mr. Sleigh is approximately four

6

months.

7

appointed by the docket or two months if you take the

8

time where he thought and understood that he was on the

9

case, and in light of the three-year delay, that amount

If you take all four months where he was

10

of time is really inconsequential.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It may have been a

12

good concession below.

I mean, it would -- as I

13

understand it, the problem arose because of change in

14

the contract, right?

15

MS. RAINVILLE:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

That's correct.
I mean, that may

well have been attributable to the State.

18

MS. RAINVILLE:

19

attributable to the defender general.

20

the problems in this case is that we don't have a record

21

of why different attorneys -- Attorney No. 4, Donaldson,

22

and Attorney No. 5, Sleigh, were never asked what they

23

did or -

24
25

It -- it may well have been

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that's one of

I suppose you are

willing to concede that there are situations where the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

delay would be attributable to the State because of

2

systemic problems?

3

MS. RAINVILLE:

Yes.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The State has so

5

many cases, and it's only willing to hire one lawyer.

6

That lawyer can't possibly handle all the cases.

7

MS. RAINVILLE:

Absolutely.

But that's not

8

the case here.

That might be the situation if, for

9

example, the defender general said to every defendant:

10

If you want a trial with a lawyer, you have to wait a

11

year.

That's not what happened here.

12

What happened here is the defender general

13

was incredibly diligent.

14

times the same day.

15

Ammons was appointed.

16

replacement counsel, Mr. Harnett, was appointed.

17

18

appointed.

19

shows that Sleigh was appointed.

20

He appointed new counsel five

Vermont Legislature and obtained funding, and the

But the defender

legislature came up to the plate very quickly, in a

2

matter of weeks.

3

The last withdrawal of Lawyer No. 5 happens

4

on April 10th.

5

in the appendix from the defender general saying that

6

the legislature has approved new funding.

7

literally a matter of weeks before the legislature comes

8

to the plate and provides additional funding.

9

It's June 20th that there is the letter

It's -- it's

So to the extent that -- that that is State

10

action, the defender general has been incredibly

11

expeditious, incredibly diligent, and went to the

12

extraordinary length of getting additional funding for

13

the sixth lawyer.

14

We -- we would concede -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess when -- when the

15

last two lawyers withdrew because their contracts had

16

expired, I suppose the court could have refused to

17

permit them to withdraw, couldn't it?

18

MS. RAINVILLE:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It could have.
Couldn't it say you -- you

20

have an ethical duty; having undertaken representation,

21

and it being very difficult to get anybody else, you -

22

you stay in the case?

23
24
25

MS. RAINVILLE:

The -- the court could have,

and certainly JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does it make it not the
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State's court -- not the State's fault no matter what?

2

Is -- is the court's misfeasance the State's

3

misfeasance?

4

Do you attribute that to the State?

MS. RAINVILLE:

The court's misfeasance

5

would -- would certainly be attributable to the State,

6

but we would argue that it would be a neutral factor.

7

But here, Your Honor, Brillon would -- in terms of the

8

fourth lawyer, Mr. Donaldson, he sought to have him

9

fired.

And, in fact, it was his letter to the court and

10

then a subsequent motion to the court to have that

11

lawyer dismissed.

12

the -- the trial judge asked Brillon, do you want to

13

have -- do you still want to have him fired despite all

14

this delay and everything, and Brillon says yes, clearly

15

the court with regard to Donaldson could have said to

16

Donaldson, you stay on this case and get this case to

17

trial.

18

wanted a new lawyer.

And in that colloquy when the -- when

But Brillon waived that.

Brillon said that he

19

With regard to Sleigh -

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- with that particular

21

period.

The trouble that I have with that particular

22

period is August 1, 2003, to June 14, 2004, isn't that

23

right?

That is Donaldson -- or that's Moore?

24

MS. RAINVILLE:

That's Moore.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Donaldson was

Official - Subject to Final Review

the first one?
MS. RAINVILLE:

Donaldson was actually

Lawyer No. 4.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Go ahead.

Before you start, let me

7

just make a comment and a -- and a question based on it.

8

The comment is I -- I'm willing to accept a lot of what

9

you say here, there is plenty of blame to go around.

10

But you accept, as I understand it, the proposition that

11

the State has simply got an affirmative duty to make

12

some kind of effective trial and representation

13

arrangement.

14

providing the public defender, it has that duty simply

15

through providing a court that will keep things moving,

16

and I think that's common ground.

17

It -- it -- it has that duty through

If that, as it seems to be, is common

18

ground, then do we have anything before us in this case,

19

except sort of going through the list of counsel, the

20

list of reasons, the list of delays and reviewing the

21

Vermont Supreme Court on, in effect, the details that it

22

assumed in applying the rule?

23

to me that there isn't an issue of principle dividing

24

the parties here, it's a series of issues of details.

25

Is that an unfair way to look at the case as we've got

In other words, it seems

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

it?
MS. RAINVILLE:

You can certainly look at it

3

in terms of details, and I think that the Vermont

4

Supreme Court's findings are unsupported by the record.

5

But as a matter of law, you have delays by State actors,

6

and even if you take the two or the four months for

7

Sleigh aside, the rest of the delay, three years of

8

delay minus -- there's four months, of course, which he

9

had no counsel -- but three years minus that time, is

10
11

all caused by non-State actors.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah, but if you take

12

Sleigh, Donaldson, and the period in which there was

13

no -- I guess, following Sleigh, in which there was no

14

counsel appointed at all, you're already up to just

15

about a year.

16

Neil v. Biggers.

17

what the fight, what the serious fight is about is,

18

well, within the further total of two-year period, who

19

is to blame for this, who was to blame to that, and

20

I'm -- I'm not sure that it's of any value to just go

21

through and second-guess the Supreme Court of Vermont on

22

those details, because you've got enough in Neil v.

23

Biggers before you even get to those details.

24
25

And a year is -- is enough to trigger
And so, it seems to me that what -

MS. RAINVILLE:

Well, also in terms of just

based on Brillon's admission, there's enough for this
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court to decide the case.

2

different lawyers.

He admits that he fired three

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.
Isn't there -- isn't there

5

that very important principle involved here that doesn't

6

simply involve calculating particular periods of delay?

7

When you have a defendant who starts out by firing a

8

lawyer and engineering the withdrawal of another lawyer

9

by threatening a lawyer, is it appropriate then to go

10

through all of the subsequent periods and attribute the

11

delay to the defendant or to the prosecution or as a

12

neutral factor as if those, the initial events, hadn't

13

occurred?

14

We don't know how quickly this case would

15

have gone to trial if the first lawyer hadn't been fired

16

or if the third lawyer, I guess it was, had not been

17

threatened and forced to withdraw.

18

MS. RAINVILLE:

I believe you're absolutely

19

right, Justice Alito.

20

unconscionable in threatening both his lawyer, and the

21

facts there -

22

In this case his conduct was so

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I really wanted to ask you

23

pretty much exactly the same question.

24

exactly the terrible way he fired the first two -- the

25

first lawyer certainly, maybe the second, would it be
12
Alderson Reporting Company

If we assume

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

true that no matter how long the delay occurred after

2

that, he could never get Sixth Amendment relief?

3

MS. RAINVILLE:

4

that far, Justice Stevens.

I would -- I wouldn't go

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6

MS. RAINVILLE:

Why not?
Because what if the State

7

kept him for ten years without a trial?

8

that would ever happen.

9

there's no basis, given his conduct, to balance anything

10
11

in his favor.

I don't think

Certainly on these facts

Vermont's -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, there -- as I

12

understand it, that that first year the Vermont Supreme

13

Court agrees with you.

14

MS. RAINVILLE:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16
17

That's right.
They said, we're not

counting any of that against you.
Now we go into the second year, and the

18

second year had to do with Mr. Donaldson, a lot of it.

19

And it turns out that Mr. Donaldson actually had left

20

the office within a few days of his having been

21

appointed to do this and then he never did anything.

22

the Supreme Court of Vermont says, as far as Mr.

23

Donaldson is concerned, we do hold that against the

24

State for the reason that it is the equivalent of not

25

giving him anybody.

So

The guy they gave him wasn't even a
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

public defender, he never did a thing.

2

All right.

Now we go to the third group.

The third

3

group, the State agreed they should be charged.

That's

4

Mr. Sleigh.

They

5

said lightly, but they agreed with it.

6

The third one they agreed with it.

And as to the final group, Mrs. Moore, well,

7

it looks like from the record as if the reason that was

8

held against the State had nothing to do with her

9

performance.

It had to do with the fact that the State

10

didn't give certain records to her, which everybody

11

would agree, if it's true, should be chargeable to the

12

prosecution, which is the State.

13

So we have four periods.

14

won; in the second one he had no lawyer at all,

15

according to the court; in the third one you agree it

16

should be chargeable to you; and in the fourth one it

17

has to do possibly with prosecution errors, not defense

18

errors.

19

In one of them you

Now, what are we supposed to decide?

Are we

20

supposed to decide whether my statement is, in fact, a

21

correct statement?

22

have to read the record.

23

decide?

24
25

If so, why isn't it?

MS. RAINVILLE:

I guess we

But what else is there to

I think you can decide it

without reviewing the record, based on the fact that you
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have a defendant who fired his first lawyer six months

2

into the case, one day before trial.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MS. RAINVILLE:

And you won that.
And then filed -- fired a

5

second lawyer when the lawyer initially argued and said,

6

no, no, it's not true, I've been working; he then

7

threatened to kill the lawyer.

8

told:

9

inevitable delays.

If you want a new lawyer, there's going to be
He said:

10

to fire this lawyer.

11

another lawyer.

12

Then he at that time was

That's okay, I still want

Then he went on and fired yet

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose -- I'm not

13

sure that we necessarily want to get into the particular

14

details of a very complicated record, but there are

15

several points in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion

16

where it says that the failure of assigned lawyers to do

17

anything to move the case forward is attributable to the

18

State.

19

debating is whether or not assigned lawyers who fail to

20

move a case forward, whether that is attributable to the

21

defendant or whether it is attributable to the State

22

because they happen to work for the State.

23

And I thought the fundamental principle we were

And I would assume one way to dispose of the

24

case would be to decide that general question and send

25

it back for the Vermont Supreme Court with that guidance
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that they were wrong, as a general matter, to assign

2

delay caused by the counsel to the State, to sort

3

through the record themselves.

4
5

MS. RAINVILLE:

And I think that's a very

important point, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that point in the case?

7

Where -- where is that in this case?

8

-- I didn't see anywhere where the Vermont Supreme Court

9

said anything, said that, except in the instance where

10

I don't know who

you agreed with them.

11

Where is it in their -- where is it -- who

12

are they are referring to when they said that?

Is that

13

Donaldson?

14

was it -- it was not his attribution, nothing he did was

15

attributed.

16

appoint anyone, because to appoint Donaldson was to

17

appoint no one since he had left the office and since he

18

did nothing.

Because I thought the claim with Donaldson

Rather, it was the State's failure to

19

Now, is that what we're supposed to decide:

20

When a State appoints a person who has already left the

21

office and does nothing, under those circumstances is it

22

correct to attribute to the State their failure to

23

appoint anybody?

24
25

MS. RAINVILLE:

Well, first let me address

this point of two lawyers who did little or nothing.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Strickland v. Washington, this Court said how extremely

2

important it is when determining ineffective assistance

3

to have a strong presumption that counsel's conduct

4

falls within the wide range of reasonable professional

5

assistance, and that there should be a hearing to ask

6

counsel what they did.

7

Here the Vermont Supreme Court makes this

8

ruling without anyone at any point ever asking Mr.

9

Donaldson or Mr. Sleigh what they did.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Rainville, underneath

11

or between the lines there seems to be great discontent

12

on the part of the Vermont Supreme Court with the way

13

the public defender system is operating.

14

for you as a matter of the federal speedy trial right,

15

the Vermont Supreme Court could go back and decide just

16

the same thing under the Vermont Constitution, couldn't

17

it?

18

MS. RAINVILLE:

And if we hold

It could except for that we

19

believe that this decision creates an unconstitutional

20

situation in creating two different classes of

21

defendant, indigent and non-indigent, in their speedy

22

trial rights, such that henceforth the prosecution and

23

the courts must treat every indigent defendant

24

differently merely because they're indigent when they

25

ask for a continuance or when they ask for change of
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

counsel.

2

unpleasant choice of the constitutional due process

3

violation, that we would rather push a defendant who's

4

indigent to trial before his counsel's ready, because

5

the constitutional violation there is only one of due

6

process and he'll get a new trial, versus agreeing to

7

allow their counsel to have time to prepare, in which

8

case we risk a speedy trial violation, where he will be

9

able to walk free despite his guilt.

10

We have to oppose those.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So that we make the

Ms. Rainville, you -- you

11

began your presentation with a statement that gave me so

12

much hope.

13

reasons why we wouldn't have to get into the hairy facts

14

of the case and could decide it on -- on issues of law.

15

Okay?

16

two?

You said you were going to give us three

You only mentioned the first.

17

MS. RAINVILLE:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MS. RAINVILLE:

What are the other

The second is Remind us of the first.
The first is that this

20

creates an unconstitutional situation where there are

21

two classes of defendants treated differently by the

22

State and by the courts.

23

The second is that the delays in this case

24

were caused by non-State actors and as a matter of law

25

under Polk County cannot be a constitutional violation.
18
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that sort of gets us

2

into the facts at some point.

3

into the facts.

4

What's the third?

5

MS. RAINVILLE:

I mean, that does get us

The third is that, based on

6

his concessions, his admissions in the brief, he's

7

waived it; and that's under Barker v. Wingo where the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER

21

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

22

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

23
24
25

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. KRUGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

If you look on pages 27 through 28 of the

2

Vermont Supreme Court's opinion, it is clear that the

3

Vermont Supreme Court decided this case on the basis of

4

a single principle that it applied to the entirety of

5

the final two years of the pretrial delay in this case,

6

and that is, as the Chief Justice has noted, that the

7

failure of defendant's series of assigned counsel to

8

move his case to trial should be attributable to the

9

State.

10

As the question comes before the Court

11

today, I think the primary point of dispute is whether

12

there should be an exception to the general rule that a

13

defendant is responsible for his own lawyer's delays in

14

situations in which the lawyer purportedly does little

15

or nothing to move the case to trial; and for four

16

reasons we think that the Court should decline to create

17

a kind of attorney inaction exception to the general

18

rule.

19

First of all, we think that such a rule

20

would be inconsistent with the role of a lawyer in an

21

adversarial system and would undermine a lawyer's

22

authority to make day-to-day decisions about the

23

scheduling of pretrial proceedings.

24
25

Second, we think that such a rule would be
enormously difficult for courts to administer in
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

practice, because attorney inaction is generally

2

difficult to discern in the midst of pretrial

3

proceedings and the risk of error would be to deprive

4

the defendant of the time that his lawyer may genuinely

5

need in order to prepare an effective defense.

6

The third reason is that it would create

7

opportunities for gamesmanship; it would create

8

incentives for defendants to use the services of their

9

lawyer so long as it suits them, but then to complain

10

later that the lawyer was inactive and therefore they

11

should not be held responsible for the lawyer's delay.

12

And as to the lawyers themselves, it would create an

13

incentive to unreasonably delay, with the comfort of

14

knowing that the worst that would happen is the best

15

possible outcome for their client, which is the

16

dismissal of charges with prejudice.

17

And finally, we think that such a rule would

18

create an unjustifiable distinction between the

19

treatments of appointed counsel and retained counsel in

20

our system.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

With respect to that last

22

point, let me ask you this question.

23

we have paid counsel in a criminal case and, as a result

24

of -- of delays by the prosecution, but primarily as a

25

result of requests for continuance after continuance
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Let's assume we -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

after continuance, the -- the case is not tried; it's a

2

simple case and it's not tried for three years.

3

Is -- is it open to a reviewing court on

4

constitutional grounds to say that the State has got an

5

affirmative obligation, a non-delegable obligation, to

6

bring cases to trial in a reasonable time?

7

the reason for the failure in this three-year case is

8

because counsel just kept trying to -- to shove it off,

9

or the courts were not diligent in scheduling it for

And whether

10

trial, at some point that non-delegable obligation has

11

been violated.

12

constitutionally based position?

13

Is -- is that a -- a possible

MS. KRUGER:

I think that Barker makes clear

14

that defendants can waive their right to a speedy trial

15

and that indeed defendants will often desire to put off

16

trial as long as possible.

17

proper consideration to the Barker Court's explanation

18

of the nature and purposes of the right, and in

19

particular focusing on the fact that the only possible

20

remedy for the speedy trial violation is a remedy that

21

uniquely advantages defendants and poses substantial

22

burdens on society, we think ultimately a defendant

23

can't escape responsibility for continuances that he has

24

requested through or without the assistance of counsel,

25

simply by blaming the prosecution for failing to object

I think that in giving

or by blaming the courts for failing to go along.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, what if the -- what

3

if we change the facts slightly.

4

himself never says anything on the record?

5

thing we've got on the record are repeated requests by

6

paid counsel for continuances, and then after three

7

years the defendant fires paid counsel and says:

8

9

I shouldn't have to wait that long.

12

MS. KRUGER:

It would still be the same.

We

13

think that fundamentally the principal safeguard against

14

that kind of unreasonable attorney-caused delay is the

15

attorney's ethical obligation, which creates a duty in

16

the attorney to represent his clients with reasonable

17

diligence and promptness.

18

would require -

19

We think that a rule that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Lots -- lots of very

20

effective criminal trial lawyers believe that the first

21

tactic is delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.

22

MS. KRUGER:

And I think it's precisely for

23

that reason, because a delay may ultimately be in the

24

client's interest, that this Court should decline to

25

fashion a rule that makes the exercise of the remedy,
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which is again an extreme remedy that advantages the

2

defendant alone, exercisable at the option solely of the

3

defendant.

4

We think for that reason the defendant

5

necessarily has to be responsible for any delays that

6

are caused either by him or by the person who is

7

appointed to represent him.

8

the lawyer is to zealously advocate on behalf of the

9

defendant's interests, and if the defendant desires to

Again, the ethical duty of

10

go to trial as quickly as possible, it's still the

11

lawyer's duty under the ethical rules to try to

12

accommodate that request, while at the same time doing

13

everything he can to prepare an effective defense.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask you this

15

question about your reliance on pages 27 and 28.

16

describe it as delays by the lawyers themselves, I

17

understand your comment as being right on the nose.

18

I understood part of that to be talking about the

19

situation in which the defender general's office has not

20

performed its duty with sufficient promptness.

21

If you

But

And would you not agree if there were a

22

period, say, of seven or eight months in which they just

23

didn't get around to appointing a lawyer, that that

24

should be charged against the State?

25

MS. KRUGER:

We would agree, Justice
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Stevens.

2

about six months during which the Respondent was not

3

represented at all, and we think in view of the State's

4

ultimate responsibility for providing counsel to

5

indigent defendants, when the State doesn't comply in a

6

timely fashion with that duty, that delay is properly

7

attributable to the State.

8

In this case there were a period of a total of

Although in this case, because the delay was

9

not the product of a deliberate effort to hamper the

10

defense, we think that that period should weigh only

11

lightly against the State; and ultimately, given the

12

other factors at issue in this case, the absence of any

13

actual trial prejudice in particular, we think that

14

ultimately those six months are insufficient to

15

establish a speedy trial violation.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Isn't the prejudice factor

17

pretty much established as long as the guy has to stay

18

in jail during this entire period?

19

MS. KRUGER:

I think that that's certainly

20

one form of prejudice, but in the Barker balancing -- in

21

Barker itself, for example, the defendant was

22

incarcerated for ten months during the pretrial

23

proceedings, and the Court nevertheless found that there

24

was no speedy trial violation.

25

principle applies in this case.

We think a similar
Although incarceration

25
Alderson Reporting Company

is obviously prejudicial to defendants, in this case

2

there was no prejudice above and beyond that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

Did he get to offset it

against the time for the pretrial incarceration?
MS. KRUGER:

I am not aware that he did, but

8

this Court made clear in Strunk that getting credit for

9

time served is not an appropriate remedy for a speedy

10

trial violation, that the only possible remedy is again

11

what the Vermont Supreme Court did, erroneously in our

12

view, which is to dismiss the charges without

13

possibility of reindictment.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What would you think of a

15

rule that said where most of the delay is attributable

16

to the defendant, he doesn't -- he doesn't walk?

17

seems like a reasonable rule.

18

most of it is attributable to the defendant himself, it

19

is -- it is not a basis for dismissing the indictment?

20

MS. KRUGER:

That

Whatever the delay is, if

We think that a defendant -- we

21

think that that rule would make a great deal of sense.

22

When a defendant -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would make it easy to

24

decide this case because the -- the supreme court's

25

opinion acknowledges that most of the -- most of the
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

delay was caused by the defendant.

2

MS. KRUGER:

Well, the Vermont Supreme Court

3

thought that some of the delay was caused by the

4

defendant and didn't charge most of that period to the

5

State to support its finding of the speedy trial

6

violation.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would you really get by

8

that rule if there were, say, four years of delay and

9

two years and one month was attributable to the

10
11

defendant and two years to the State?
MS. KRUGER:

We would think that a court

12

evaluating a speedy trial claim in that case would

13

properly exclude any period that was attributable to the

14

defendant and focus specifically on that period that was

15

attributable to the State in determining whether or not

16

the right was violated.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I'm sure

18

you have gone through the record and, agreeing with

19

Justice Stevens that the periods where there wasn't a

20

contract, the State couldn't provide somebody, do count

21

against the State, but disagreeing with the Vermont

22

Supreme Court that when an assigned counsel fails to

23

move the case forward that is attributable to the State

24

and not the defendant, what's the difference in time?

25

MS. KRUGER:

The difference in time is -- I
27

Alderson Reporting Company

think that the -- as the case comes to the court, the

2

final 11 months of the pretrial delay is not seriously

3

in dispute.

4

of arguments about concurrent causes of delay unrelated

5

to the performance of his counsel.

6

arguments are not properly before the Court because they

7

fall well outside the scope of the question as to which

8

this Court granted review and because they were neither

9

pressed nor passed on below.

10

I think that Respondent has raised a number

I think that those

I think that leaves the middle 14 months of

11

the pretrial delay.

And I think, given the Vermont

12

concession, the Vermont Supreme Court focus naturally

13

rests on the 5.5-month period during which Paul

14

Donaldson represented Respondent.

respect -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

MS. KRUGER:

And we think, with

Yes?

We think with respect to that

18

period, we think that there is no basis for shifting the

19

responsibility for that delay that Paul Donaldson sought

20

before going to trial from defendant to the State

21

because, as Justice Scalia has rightly pointed out, any

22

contract expiration didn't in and of itself end the

23

attorney-client relationship, and Paul Donaldson

24

remained the agent and advocate of his client during

25

that period.

that that was what was happening, which would be

MR. NELSON:

Let me start -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is Donaldson a case where

8

how to deal with it.

9

MR. NELSON:

I don't know

Let me start with Donaldson,

10

and I think in answer to your question, I don't think

11

Donaldson is substantially different from Sleigh.

12

won't go over the circumstances of Donaldson's

13

appointment, but once he was appointed, he began

14

conversations with the defender general about getting

15

off the case.

16

significant fact about those conversations is that the

17

defender general told Donaldson he was going to be

18

replaced.

19

I

And I think the sense -- and -- and a

We don't know exactly when that happened,

20

but he told him he was going to be replaced with someone

21

who was more competent, more qualified to deal with a

22

life imprisonment case.

23

which will light a fire under a lawyer to prepare a

24

case, that he knows he's not going to try.

Donaldson then asks for time.

The court let those deadlines pass without a word.

Now the court -- I think the defender

16

general failed in his responsibility with regard to

17

Donaldson.

18

in not noticing the -- the missed deadlines and in

19

allowing the trial date to pass without a trial; and I

20

think the Court also failed in its duty in allowing

21

Donaldson off the case, which rendered any catch-up time

22

that he had to do pointless, without any inquiry at all.

23

The court, it's clear from the record, deferred entirely

24

to the defender general, and so I think the Vermont

25

court on that record thought that there was enough State

That's State involvement.

41
Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What does your -

5

your argument do to the fundamental and I think quite

6

vital principle in Polk County that public defenders

work for their clients; they don't work for the State?

9

MR. NELSON:

It does nothing to Polk County,

and we acknowledge that -- that Paul Donaldson's

10

inaction by itself, if it had nothing to do with the

11

State, if the State did not involve itself or condone -

12

if the State had no responsibility with regard to that

13

time, the State would have no responsibility under

14

Barker.

15

Vermont Supreme Court's opinion, fairly read, fairly

16

read says anything other than that.

17

That's perfectly clear, and I don't think the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The Vermont Well, I guess fairly

18

read, it does say the failure of several assigned

19

counsel to do anything to move the case forward is

20

attributable to the State, because they didn't do

21

anything, I guess is the touchstone.

22

MR. NELSON:

Well, I think I have two

23

responses to that.

One is that in the context of the

24

rest of the opinion, what the court was talking about

25

was a breakdown of the system, and the focus was on two
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

actors, both State actors, the assigning agency, the

2

defender general, and the court and I don't think

3

there's any dispute that both of those are indeed State

4

actions, and that delays which can be traced to them,

5

which they have a hand in, can be weighed against panned

6

the State under Barker.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it doesn't say that; it

8

really does say most of the delay was caused by the

9

inability or unwillingness of assigned counsel, not of

10

the -- of the institution that appoints them,

11

unwillingness or inability of assigned counsel to move

12

the case forward.

13

That looks to me like -

MR. NELSON:

I think -- elsewhere in the

14

opinion, Justice Scalia, I think the court is clear that

15

-- that they were faulting the defender general, and to

16

a lesser extent the court.

17

stress on the court's nonfeasance than the Vermont

18

Supreme Court did, but in fact, the time adds up to the

19

same.

When is that attributable to the

It would not be attributable to

14

the State if the assigning agency was -- had no fault,

15

had no supervising duty that it failed to perform, that

16

the lawyer was essentially on his own or her own; and it

would also assume, I think, if the delay went on long

problem, that the rule that I understand the Vermont

that's attributable to the State, you would disagree

6

they're not assigning enough defenders, they're not

You would say no, there has to be a systemic

MR. NELSON:

Maybe I'm not using the word

9

systemic in the same sense you are.

All I would say is

10

say is it doesn't have to happen to a lot of people, it

11

could happen to just one person, but it would only

12

happen to that one person if a public, State agency was

MR. NELSON:

makes this a State response -- failure of responsibility

is that the State had the ability to do something about

against the defendant very heavily, the episodes with

lawyer number one and number three, because that was

4

really bad stuff.

5

some of the other delays, but she called those "neutral"

6

in the weighing process.

7

counsel number one was fired, counsel number three, who

8

says his life was threatened by the defendant, don't

9

those have to count very heavily against the defendant?

10

The State is perhaps responsible for

MR. NELSON:

Don't those two episodes,

Justice Ginsburg, I don't think

11

that Barker works that way.

12

that time which is attributable to the defendant gets

13

subtracted from the total delay; that that's not

14

considered.

15

the State has to account for; and there are -- there

16

will be segments of that time, segments of that delay

17

which are nobody's fault, and those delays would in fact

18

be truly neutral in the sense of they would have no

19

weight against the State; and there are others that

20

would count more or less heavily against the State.

21

I think what Barker says is

That the rest of the time is a period which

So I think the effect of what went on with

22

Jerry Altieri, which I think was not much more than two

23

months of the total time that he was on board, I think

24

the effect of that is to subtract that period, and then

25

any catch-up period that his firing or his dismissal
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

required, subtract that period as well from the total,

2

and weigh the rest more or less heavily or perhaps not

at all against the State.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the rest, I

5

couldn't find in his final counsel's representation -- I

counsel.

the time I don't think you can put a number on.

It adds up to 14 months.

Maybe it's not time that we're trying to add

up, but responsibility.

And what the -- what the State

court was saying was when a case is as old as this one

was when Moore took it over, the court should be very

25

vigilant and grudging in its grants of continuances, and
