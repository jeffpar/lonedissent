ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C. MIZER

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7
8

MR. MIZER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

Three separate lines of double jeopardy

10

analysis lead independently to the conclusion that the

11

Double Jeopardy Clause commits the Ohio postconviction

12

court to hold a hearing to determine whether Mr. Bies is

13

mentally retarded for purposes of Atkins.

14

First, there has been no acquittal in this

15

case.

16

third, even if collateral estoppel analysis applies

17

under Ashe versus Swenson, the Atkins issue has not

18

actually and necessarily been decided.

19

factors shows that the Ohio court's decision to go

20

forward with the Atkins hearing was reasonable, and this

21

Court therefore should, consistent with AEDPA, give the

22

Ohio courts their first chance to adjudicate Mr. Bies's

23

Atkins claim.

24
25

Second, there is no successive jeopardy; and,

Each of these

Much of the dispute in this case centers on
the parties' disagreement over the meaning of Ashe

versus Swenson and its application.

2

benefit from Ashe because Ashe -- the Ashe collateral

3

estoppel rule only operates to benefit defendants who

4

have in hand an earlier acquittal, and Mr. Bies has

5

never been acquitted of the death penalty in any sense

6

of the word.

7

But Mr. Bies cannot

This Court, beginning in Bullington and

8

extending through Sattazahn, has defined an "acquittal"

9

in a death penalty context as a finding by the sentencer

10

that the death -- that the sentence of death is

11

warranted in a particular case.

12

the trial judge in this case agreed that death was

13

warranted, and, in fact, the Ohio Supreme Court and

14

every reviewing court has agreed that death was

15

warranted.

he was mentally retarded, and that was a mitigator.

23

record of this case?

24
25

MR. MIZER:

But assuming you're right on

But what would the State

I mean why do it again?
The reason to do it again, Your

Honor, is because the -- the standard set forth by the
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Ohio Supreme Court in Lott when it was implementing this

2

Court's decision in Atkins contained three definitions

3

-- three elements of the Atkins definition, of the

4

definition of "mental retardation."

5

elements were not carefully demonstrated by Dr. Winter.

6

And, in fact, the -- the record here -- the Ohio

7

post-conviction court has concluded -- doesn't suffice

8

to make the post-Atkins Lott determination.

9

And those three

The -- at pages 101a to 104a of the Petition

10

Appendix, the State postconviction court looks at all

11

the evidence, including Dr. Winter's testimony, and says

12

that there needs to be a hearing where experts will be

13

called in order to determine whether Mr. Bies not only

14

suffers from significant intellectual limitations, which

15

includes IQ, but there is conflicting IQ evidence in the

16

record.

17

substantial limitations in adaptive skills, the skills

18

needed for daily life, which Dr. Winter never

19

specifically spoke about.

20

she was talking about mental retardation.

21

It also includes findings that he suffers from

She spoke only about IQ when

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't want to take you

22

too far outside the record, and you can come back to it,

23

but I -- I just have this question.

24

jury case the jury -- pre-Atkins, the jury says, we find

25

that the defendant has a 65 IQ, but that in light of the
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Suppose that in a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

heinous nature of the offense, this is not a mitigating

2

factor, and that he should be sentenced to death.

3
4

In a subsequent Atkins proceeding, can the
jury finding with reference to the IQ be conclusive?

5

MR. MIZER:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MR. MIZER:

8

No, it cannot.
Or must that be reopened?

It can, Your Honor, for two

reasons.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

MR. MIZER:

It can -- can be reopened?

It can be.

Yes, I'm sorry.

It

can't be preclusive.

12

reasons, one relating to the definition of "mental

13

retardation" post-Atkins and the other relating to the

14

different issues.

15

It can be reopened for two

First, with respect to the definition, the

16

Ohio Supreme Court has made clear in Lott that IQ is not

17

enough to determine mental retardation.

18

the clinicians and the American Association of Mental

19

Retardation say that IQ is not enough, particularly in a

20

borderline case where IQ is close to the line.

21

there you need to look very carefully at adaptive

22

skills.

23

In fact, the -

And

Moreover JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But could the -- could the

24

defendant argue the -- that -- the accused argue that at

25

least as to the finding of the 65 IQ, that that is a

given.

2

MR. MIZER:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

And And that that issue, i.e.,

the level of IQ, cannot be relitigated, the number?

5

MR. MIZER:

And the answer to that is no,

6

Your Honor, for issue preclusive purposes, because the

7

issue is completely different in the mitigation context

8

from the post-Atkins context.

9

difference is highlighted by the difference between

And I think that

10

Penry and Atkins.

11

talking about, the jury and then the Ohio Supreme Court

12

when it affirmed, was what this Court told it to talk

13

about in Penry.

14

Pre-Atkins what the sentencer was

It was talking about mental retardation as a

15

mitigating factor, and the State of Ohio and the Ohio

16

courts had to know the definition of "mental

17

retardation" pre-Atkins.

18

been a definition and if the courts had excluded

19

evidence from the jury that didn't rise to a certain

20

level of severity, then we would have run into a -- a

21

post -- a Penry and Tennard problem.

22

evidence was allowed in, and it was treated as

23

mitigating.

24
25

In fact, I think if there had

And so all of the

And so what the Ohio Supreme Court was doing
was what Penry told it to do:

Considering mitigating

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidence of mental retardation.

2

inquiries are different, because Atkins effectively

3

constitutionalized a clinical judgment in making -- in

4

defining a categorical bar on executing the mentally

5

retarded.

6

But post-Atkins the

And so post-Atkins it is necessary to be

7

very careful about the clinical judgment, and this

8

record does not suffice for that clinical judgment.

9

I think it -- think it does not behoove either party to

suggest that the record -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, when you say "the

12

clinical judgment," you mean the specific finding of a

The -- the clinical judgment

that I refer to, Your Honor, is that required by -- by

18

It looks not only at IQ, but also at the adaptive

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

I grant you that

19

under -- under the earlier case the 65 IQ was not

20

dispositive, and I mean that was the -- the case in

21

Justice Kennedy's hypothetical.

22

under the early case to come to a determination of what

23

the IQ was, even though that determination was not

24

dispositive of the result.

25

to come to a determination, why shouldn't there be a

But it was necessary

And because it was necessary

preclusion?

2

MR. MIZER:

Because, Your Honor, I think

3

there are two different meanings of "necessary."

4

-- it was necessary in the sense that it had to be done,

5

but it wasn't necessary in the issue preclusive offense

6

because it -- it was -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It wasn't necessary to

8

reach that particular -- in other words, the

9

determination of 65 was not necessary to reach the

10

It was

conclusion that they reached.

11

MR. MIZER:

Correct.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And you -- you are saying

13

the very fact that it was not dispositive of the result

14

means that it cannot be preclusive now?

15

MR. MIZER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

MR. MIZER:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Okay.

And -- and May I ask how it worked

19

pre-Atkins when mental retardation was a mitigator?

20

are told that the appellate courts independently

21

reviewed.

22

yes, there is a mitigator mental retardation, but it

23

doesn't overcome the aggravator, so the jury comes in

24

with a death sentence.

25

We have a finding at the trial level that,

Then at the appellate level, is there a
9
Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

continuing adversary contest about whether retardation

2

exists and, therefore, is a mitigator, or is it just the

3

-- the judge, the appellate judge, looking over the

4

record that has been made at trial?

5

MR. MIZER:

The -- the appellate courts

6

engaged in a de novo record and new -- new evidence

7

doesn't come into the record on direct review.

8

there is still argument -- the parties are still in an

9

adversarial posture.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

So -- so that the

11

prosecutor could still argue that was unreasonable for

12

them to find mental retardation, so there shouldn't be

13

that mitigator?

14

MR. MIZER:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

15

there wasn't at the time a -- a great deal of incentive

16

to litigate that question because the Ohio Supreme Court

17

had said that mental retardation only merited some

18

weight in mitigation.

19

appellate briefs on direct review are in the Joint

20

Appendix and -- excerpts of those briefs.

21

himself on direct review didn't vigorously argue his

22

mental retardation evidence.

23

"arguably," in his words, "the most persuasive

24

mitigating evidence" was his lack of a prior record and

25

his lack of prior violent history.

And, in fact, the -- the

And Mr. Bies

In fact, he said that the,

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And so none of the parties thought that

2

mental retardation in 1992 through 1996 was very

3

persuasive, because the courts didn't treat it and the

4

jury didn't treat it as very persuasive, Perhaps for the

5

reasons that this Court underscored in Atkins, where the

6

Court said that, as it had said in Penry, that mental

7

retardation evidence presented to a jury in mitigation

8

could be a two-edged sword, because some jurors might

9

perceive and the prosecutor might argue that that

10

evidence went to future dangerousness, and therefore the

11

-- the State of Ohio argued that the mental retardation

12

evidence here was simply not persuasive and it was

13

outweighed by the -- the aggravating factors that the

14

jury had found.

15

Atkins told the -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I interrupt right

16

there, Mr. Mizer?

17

decision to impose the death penalty as having found

18

that he was not mentally retarded and therefore was not

19

a mitigating factor, or that even though he was -- a

20

mitigating factor, the aggravating factors outweighed

21

that factor?

22

Is it fair to interpret the jury's

MR. MIZER:

I think, Your Honor, that it's

23

fairest and the record that's easiest to go by is what

24

the Ohio Supreme Court said, because the jury didn't

25

make any specific remarks about mental retardation as a
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mitigator; the Ohio Supreme Court did.

2

But the -- the jury's verdict and then the

3

Ohio Supreme Court's affirmance should best be read as a

4

determination that the aggravating factors outweigh the

5

mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and that

6

mental retardation was one of those mitigating factors.

7

But it should not be read as a mini-verdict on the

8

existence of or the question of whether Mr. Bies is

9

mentally retarded.

10

Because -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If they didn't make a

11

finding on mental retardation, how -- how could the

12

appellate court determine that it was a mitigator but

13

overwhelmed by the aggravating -- what did the judge

14

charge the jury about mitigators and aggravators?

15

MR. MIZER:

The judge charged the jury that

16

-- first of all, Your Honor, the mitigating evidence

17

introduced by Mr. Bies was not extensive.

18

introduced an unsworn statement by himself and then Dr.

19

Winter testified, and that was the extent of the case in

20

mitigation.

21

statutory mitigating factors in Ohio, which is found in

22

Ohio Revised Code 2929.04.

23

He -- he

So the jury was charged with the various

The mental retardation evidence was relevant

24

under two of those mitigating statutory factors, one,

25

factor 3, which went to mental disease or defect, and
12
Alderson Reporting Company

then the catch-all, factor 7.

2

Poland helps to illuminate what the -- not only what the

3

jury was doing, but also what the Ohio Supreme Court was

4

doing when it -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

retardation as a mitigator?

8
9

But the -- but I think

First go back to the

How do we know that the jury found mental

MR. MIZER:

We don't, Your Honor.

All that

we know is that the jury determined that the aggravating

10

factors outweighed the mitigators beyond a reasonable

11

doubt.

12

its hat on was the statement by the Ohio Supreme Court

13

on direct review that Mr. Bies's mental retardation

14

merits weight in mitigation.

15

What we do know and what the Sixth Circuit hung

Poland explains that that -- that statement

16

by the Ohio Supreme Court should not be treated as a

17

mini-verdict on the mitigating factor, but instead it

18

should be read as an Eighth Amendment-required marking

19

of the guidepost, the very guidepost that this Court in

20

Penry said must be marked, the relevance of mitigating

21

evidence of mental retardation.

22

But -- but Poland says it's wrong to think

23

of that marking of that Eighth Amendment guidepost as a

24

mini-verdict on mental retardation, and instead it

25

should just be thought of as one of the factors that was
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

bounding the discretion of the sentencer.

2

instructs that Mr. Bies and the Sixth Circuit are wrong

3

to think of mental retardation as actually having been

4

found in some sense that affords preclusive effect,

5

because instead it was just an Eighth Amendment

6

balancing.

7

And so Poland

And instead what Atkins tells us is that the

8

State of Ohio, just as the States were given the

9

opportunity after Ford v. Wainwright in the insanity

10

context, should be given the opportunity for the very

11

first time in this case to implement Atkins to

12

determine, given clinical expert judgment, whether or

13

not Mr. Bies is in fact mentally retarded under the

14

three-part -

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I understand the argument

16

that the issues are not quite the same, that the Atkins

issue of mental retardation is not quite the same as the

issue that was litigated.

the case.

20

going.

Let's try and get that out of

I think that's where Justice Kennedy was

21

Suppose it was a gun case and the Supreme

22

Court originally thought you could convict people who

23

sell drugs of simple possession of a gun.

24

finding, because it's a bench trial, that he simply

25

possessed but did not otherwise use the gun.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

There's a

Then the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Supreme Court holds that that isn't enough under the

2

statute.

3

proceeding on appeal or whatever is still going on, we

4

want a second shot at this; we want to show he did more

5

than simply possess.

6

previously lost on or can the State -- can he get a

7

second shot?

8
9

So now the State wants to argue, because the

Is the State bound by what it

MR. MIZER:

The answer is that the State is

not bound, for two reasons, the first relating to issue

10

preclusion and the second relating to the double

11

jeopardy doctrine in Ashe.

12

the finding with respect to the gun doesn't carry

13

preclusive effect because this Court said in --

14

Sunnen and other cases that when there is a change in

15

legal consequences, that change is enough to prevent the

16

operation of preclusive rules.

On issue preclusion, the -

17

But on the double jeopardy doctrine -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not -- I'm not going to

19

go into double jeopardy.

I don't think necessarily that

20

it's double jeopardy that -- that is relevant here.

21

I have a -- have you run into this in a different

22

context?

23

It would be some kind of due process problem.

24

there isn't a problem.

25

anything like what I described?

But

They wouldn't use the word "double jeopardy."
Maybe

Have you run in your research to

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. MIZER:

No, Your Honor, because it is

2

important to remember that this is -- this is a double

3

jeopardy case because of Ashe, and because this is in

4

Federal habeas.

5

With respect to your question about due

6

process or -- or other rules aside from due process,

7

it's possible that the State could have more expansive

8

common law or State law interpretations of the

9

collateral estoppel rules, and maybe those would benefit

10

the defendant.

11

declined to use due process to incorporate collateral

12

estoppel rules constitutionally.

13

defendant would only be left with the hope that the

14

State would have more expansive collateral estoppel

15

rules.

16

This Court in -- in the Hoag case

So in your case the

But to return to Ashe, the defendant here is

17

claiming that he is entitled to a constitutionalized

18

version of collateral estoppel because of Ashe, but he's

19

not entitled to that protection because Ashe applies

20

only where a defendant has previously been acquitted,

21

and he has not.

22

It also applies only in a case where the

23

defendant is facing a successive jeopardy of some sort.

24

Now, Mr. Bies's sentence is -- is surely at issue in

25

this case, but it's at issue in the sense that it would
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be at issue in, say, a direct appeal.

It's only -

2

there has only been one prosecution.

3

taken one crack at convicting him or imposing a

4

sentence, and that one sentence is what's at issue here.

The State has only

5

And so there is not anything successive

6

about this case, and so the Double Jeopardy Clause,

7

either through the put-in-jeopardy text or through the

8

acquittal requirement, simply has nothing to offer Mr.

9

Bies in the way of assistance.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

about exhaustion?

here?

13

exhaustion?

Could I ask you about -

What should we do about exhaustion

I take it you don't -- you're not waiving

14

MR. MIZER:

Your Honor, we're not contending

15

that the Ashe claim is unexhausted.

16

that's exhausted because in the Ohio courts it is not

17

permissible to take an interlocutory appeal when a

18

double jeopardy claim has been denied, as it was in this

19

case.

We agree that

does the State have any position now as to his IQ?
MR. MIZER:

No, Your Honor.

The Ohio

13

Winters testified at trial that it was 68 or 69; she

decision that Dr. Winter, who was the testifying

22

psychiatrist, did not apply the clinical definition of

23

mental retardation in forming her opinions and rendering

24

her conclusions was an unreasonable determination of the

25

facts in light of the evidence presented in the State

The panel decided this case under 2254(d)(2).

court proceeding.
And it was on that basis the court went

3

through the evidence and determined that, in fact,

4

Dr. Winter had used the clinical definition of mental

5

retardation in rendering her opinion, and that that

6

meant that the Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio

7

Supreme Court made a finding of mental retardation based

8

on the clinical -- the clinical definition of mental

9

retardation.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But even -- even if that's

11

so, that's not necessarily an -- an Atkins finding,

12

isn't that correct?

13

MR. BLUME:

14

if there's something -

15

No, I think it is.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's not as

Atkin -- Atkin -- we didn't

16

determine what the definition of retardation was.

17

we operated in Atkins on a broad conception of

18

retardation and we came down with a general rule.

19

we left it for later litigation, starting in the States,

20

to determine exactly how that line ought to be drawn.

21

We didn't know where the line ought to be

22

drawn at that point and certainly the clinical

23

psychologists didn't know, regardless of what the -

24

what definition was being used.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the Ohio Supreme

We -

But

2

MR. BLUME:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

Pardon me?
The -- wasn't the Ohio

Supreme Court decision in this case pre-Atkins?

5

MR. BLUME:

Yes, it was.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the -

And it was dealing with

7

retardation as a mitigator, not retardation as

8

conclusive that there can be no death penalty.

9

MR. BLUME:

That's true, but the -- the

10

important point, I think, that formed the basis of the

11

Sixth Circuit opinion was that in Lott versus -- which

12

is the Ohio decision post-Atkins, in Lott they said

13

we're embracing the clinical definition of mental

14

retardation.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But before you get to

16

whether -- anything like that, you are urging issue

17

preclusion against the winner.

18

in this case.

19

operating against a judgment winner.

20

is for the party who fought this out and won.

21

It was a death sentence

And I am not aware of issue preclusion
Issue preclusion

Here we have a death sentence.

So there -

22

the ultimate determination, whatever intermediate

23

determinations might have been made on the way, like

24

mental retardation exists and was a mitigator, the

25

ultimate judgment is death.

And I am not aware of, in

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

all of issue preclusion, where a judgment winner is

2

precluded.

3

MR. BLUME:

Well, clearly that is the more

4

typical procedural context, and it happens normally in

5

the criminal context of someone that's been acquitted.

6

But the procedural posture here is unique, because what

7

you have is a prior finding of mental retardation

8

pre-Atkins, and clearly, at least according to the

9

panel, using the definition of mental retardation which

10
11

is now in effect in Ohio.
Then subsequent to that you had this Court's

12

decision in Ohio -- I mean this Court's decision in

13

Atkins, which creates a retroactive new rule which says

14

that people with mental retardation can't be executed.

15

The essence of a retroactive new rule is that it

16

attaches new legal consequences to prior conduct.

17

So it is both the rule of Ashe, which says

18

when an issue has been determined in a final proceeding,

19

combined with this Court's decision in Atkins placing a

20

category of people -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the question is what

22

is the issue, and an intermediate finding, say

23

mitigation, on the way to the ultimate conclusion, life

24

or death, is not the same issue as if retardation is

25

found, no death penalty.

It's -- it's the ultimate
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

issue in the case that was before the Ohio Supreme Court

2

is, do the aggravators outweigh the mitigators?

3

the ultimate determination, and that's what would have

4

preclusive effect, not the many intermediate findings

5

that may have been made on the way to the ultimate

6

determination of death.

7

MR. BLUME:

That's

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think

8

that minimizes or does not give adequate significance to

9

what the Ohio Supreme Court describes as its role in -

10

on the appellate review.

11

as being that they engage in an independent reweighing

12

of the mitigation against the aggravation.

13

of that is the identification of the mitigating

14

circumstances.

15

And they describe their role

A first step

So they have taken it upon themselves to

16

identify the mitigating circumstances, and they have to

17

do that by a preponderance of the evidence, which is the

18

same standard which exists now in a Lott proceeding.

19

In the course of reviewing Mr. Bies's

20

sentence on appeal, intermediate appeal of the court of

21

appeals, and then the Ohio Supreme Court, both courts

22

found that Mr. Bies had mental retardation.

23

also -- I mean, they have described this as an essential

24

function of their role, and they also don't do it

25

uncritically.
23
Alderson Reporting Company

It's not

Official - Subject to Final Review

There are other cases, State v. White for

2

3

individual had not proven his mental retardation.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In -- in response to

5

Justice Ginsburg's question, I don't see why it makes

6

any difference which court is doing what.

raised two objections.

issue being determined in the prior proceeding, the

9

characterization of his mental state as retardation was

She -- she

Number one is that so far as the

at most a subsidiary, not an ultimate fact.

11

Number two, the conclusion of that prior

12

proceeding was that he lost.

13

in either of those circumstances, the subsidiary finding

14

is not preclusive and any finding is not preclusive in

15

the manner in which he wishes to use it here.

16

And she's saying in those,

I don't see what difference it makes whether

17

we're talking about court A or court B.

18

is your response to those two objections?

19

MR. BLUME:

What is -- what

Well, on the first point, I

20

didn't mean that it necessarily matters which court it

21

did.

22

the necessary part, which is in some ways what we're

23

talking about here, was it necessary, turns on two

24

considerations.

determine, as I understand it, one, was the issue

I was saying that -- trying to describe -- usually

And the necessary -- it's designed to

Alderson Reporting Company

2

significance to the proceeding?

3

And I think, given the unique way in which

4

Ohio does the sentence review, both of those concerns

5

are satisfied.

6

As for -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If -- if the Ohio court had

7

found, the court of first instance had found, that the

8

IQ was at some different level, it could have come out

9

exactly the same way it came out in this case, couldn't

10

it?

11

MR. BLUME:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

Yes, it could have.
So the finding was not

necessary to the result?

14

MR. BLUME:

Well -

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I mean, we went through

16

this with your brother, and he pointed out, yes, it was

17

necessary to -- to consider the issue and to make some

18

kind of a finding -- I don't know how precise it had to

19

be -- but the finding that it made, the -- the actual

20

number that was used or the characterization that was

21

used to describe that number was not necessary in order,

22

in fact, to impose the death penalty.

23

MR. BLUME:

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

Well, I And -- and the sense of

necessity which is used normally in -- in this kind of
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

preclusion analysis just doesn't apply here.

2

MR. BLUME:

Well, that is not my reading of

3

the necessary cases.

4

necessary prong serves as trying to serve two goals.

5

Number one, was the issue, the question, the issue -

6

I read that the function that the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you say you

7

have -- you don't find that in the cases when you said

8

to me, and I think frankly you were right, that issue

9

preclusion -- and there are many, many cases on issue

10

preclusion -- is something that a judgment winner uses,

11

not a judgment loser, and here the Ohio -- yes, they

12

weighed and they found retardation, but they also found

13

overwhelmed by the aggravating circumstances.

14

ultimate determination of that, of all the courts, is

15

death?

16

So the

I don't see how you get to elevate an

17

intermediate determination -- there are many; some go

18

for one party, some go for the other -- to become the

19

outcome determinative factor.

20

factor is that the aggregators outweighed whatever

21

mitigators there were.

22

MR. BLUME:

The outcome determinative

Well, I mean -- again, that is

23

not my understanding of the role the necessary clause

24

plays.

25

But now, on to the winner point.
26
Alderson Reporting Company

So if

Official - Subject to Final Review

that's necessary -- I don't think there's anything in

ultimate outcome.

that's right -- and let's imagine -

It's do you win on the fact.

litigation.

But if the Warden is right -- and let's

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're saying to me, think

of Jackson and Denno, If you're in a collateral

8

proceeding and the Federal judge said there wasn't

9

enough evidence to convict him under the Constitution,

10

like the Shuffling Sam case, there isn't enough

11

evidence; it isn't that he gets a new trial.

12

Constitution entitles him to acquittal, and therefore

there is no new trial because of the Double Jeopardy

That's correct.

from Ohio because in a different context, the context of

MR. BLUME:

Well, I don't think that's a

3

fair determination of what the panel did in this case.

4

What the panel said is, number one, that we look at the

5

procedure and definition of mental retardation that Ohio

6

has adopted.

mental retardation which was used by Dr. Winter in her

8

testimony in Mr. Bies's trial, and is the -- that is the

sole basis for the determination.

Now, it is the same as the definition of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, therefore, on

But the incentive is

15

vastly different, which is an important factor in issue

16

preclusion.

17

there's overwhelming evidence of the aggravators, the

18

nature of the crime, the prosecutor is not going to care

19

so much about, so there is mental retardation as a

20

mitigator; but when it's a difference, when the

21

prosecutor wants to go for the death penalty and it

22

thinks that it's got a secure case on the atrocious

23

matter in which the crime was committed, there isn't the

24

same incentive to litigate as there is when it is the

25

ultimate question, not an issue on the way to reaching

That is, if the prosecutor thinks that

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the ultimate judgment.

2

MR. BLUME:

Well, I don't think, Justice

3

Ginsburg, the incentives have to be identical, but

4

certainly prior to Atkins the prosecution had the

5

incentive to contest the mental retardation question,

6

and in fact in this case the failure to more adequately

7

contest it wasn't due to a lack of incentives, it was

8

due to a lack of evidence.

9

that evaluated Mr. Bies, all of whom came to virtually

10

identical conclusions.

11

There were three experts

About his mental state.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, this strikes

12

me as the sort of case where their incentives might well

13

be different, as Justice Ginsburg suggested.

14

dealing with a borderline case, you don't -- and you

15

think you have very compelling aggravating factors, you

16

know, why call attention to the -- the mitigating factor

17

of the mental condition when your case can be won on the

18

others?

19

MR. BLUME:

If you're

Well, I think for three reasons,

20

Mr. Chief Justice.

Number one, as this Court recognized

21

in Atkins, in cases where there was evidence of mental

22

retardation, the jury was much less likely to impose a

23

death sentence; that in part was part of the basis of

24

this Court's decision in Atkins.

25

not contesting the evidence -- the State of Ohio did

Second, on appeal, by

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contest it here -- you ran the risk that the Ohio Court

2

of Appeals or the Ohio Supreme Court would reach a

3

different conclusion, number one, on the balance of

4

aggravation and mitigation; or, number two, on whether

5

the death sentence was disproportion.

6

7

And the Ohio

But here also, right, you had not only the

8

direct appeal and the findings, but you have additional

findings and concessions in State postconviction, where

Mr. Bies goes in in State postconviction, and he raises

11

a pre-Atkins categorical bar claim, and says I'm a

12

person with mental retardation; since this Court's

13

decision in Penry, things have changed; and I believe my

14

death sentence is disproportionate under the Ohio and

15

the United States Constitution.

16

In response to that, the State, number one,

17

conceded mental retardation and said we agree the record

18

reveals Mr. Bies is a person with mental retardation,

19

and the postconviction court then enters a finding of

20

fact.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did they admit that as a

22

finding of fact, or did they say that mental retardation

23

had been found as a mitigator by the Ohio Supreme Court?

24
25

MR. BLUME:

No, they said the record reveals

Mr. Bies to be a person with mental retardation, with an

IQ of 69.

2

sake of argument, it was nothing like a mitigating.

3

was a finding of fact, now that Mr. Bies was a person -

4

It is not that there was, we assume for the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was an admission; it

5

couldn't have been a finding of fact.

6

that's what the State claimed.

7

of the State in this State postconviction proceeding

8

that Mr. Bies is mentally retarded?

9

MR. BLUME:

It

You said that

Where is the admission

It is in the Joint Appendix at

10

153.

This is actually the State court order, the

11

finding of fact, and it says:

12

defendant is shown by the record to be mildly mentally

13

retarded with an IQ of 69.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Findings of fact.

The

You told me that this -

15

that State conceded that the defendant was mentally

16

retarded, and I'm -- that's what I asked you.

17

MR. BLUME:

I'm sorry, that is both at JA

18

143 where -- JA 143 in the State's motion, response for

19

judgment:

20

mentally retarded with an IQ of 69."

21

concession is repeated in the post conviction appeal at

22

page 160 of the Joint Appendix.

23

"The record reveals defendant to be mildly

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that

What does that have to do

24

with issue preclusion?

The State can't -- that may

25

raise an issue of judicial estoppel.
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Is that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

constitutionally required?

2

MR. BLUME:

I think it primarily does raise

3

a question of judicial estoppel, which we raised, which

4

is -- and that is not a technical basis on which to

5

grant habeas.

6

dismissed as improvidently granted.

7

It is a reason that the writ should be

There have been multiple concessions after

8

that.

This was raised by Mr. Bies in his, sort of -

9

when he asked for estoppel, he asked for it on multiple

10

bases.

11

again decided this under 2254(d)(2) grounds.

12

did not raise an issue under 2254(d)(2) in this Court.

13

Just as the fact that the warden, the panel

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The warden

But I'm not sure that

14

there's even anything -- I mean, it does raise a

15

judicial estoppel issue, but I'm not sure there is a -

16

a record hereupon which a -- a judicial estoppel claim

17

could be maintained, because in the passages that you

18

referred us to, first the State's concession and

19

secondly the finding which -- which followed from it, it

20

was a reference to mild mental retardation and a

21

specific reference to an IQ of 69.

22

I think it's a stretch, would be a stretch,

23

to go from saying that a concession of mild mental

24

retardation for purposes of mitigation analysis should

25

be taken as a concession for dispositive mental
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

retardation for Atkins purposes.

2

difficulty in seeing any clear inconsistency in the

3

State's two positions.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So I -- I have

The very next sentence is

as a matter of law -- the law as it was then -- such a

6

person may be punished by execution.

7

the stakes are quite different.

8
9

MR. BLUME:
particular claim.

So, again, it's -

Well, not in regard to this

The claim that we're talking about

10

where this concession was made and where this finding

11

was made wasn't -- this wasn't the brief on mitigation,

12

this was a postconviction challenge to his death

13

sentence as a matter of law, saying -

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that must have been,

15

the page you called my attention to must have been

16

pre-Atkins.

17

MR. BLUME:

It was pre-Atkins, but the claim

18

was a pre-Atkins Atkins claim.

19

I am categorically ineligible for the death penalty, and

20

I am ineligible because since the Court's decision in

21

Atkins, things have changed.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The claim was not - was

No, no, we're back -

23

what you called my attention to was pre-Atkins.

It was

24

the application made to the State court before Atkins

25

which put two sentences together.

One was the record

reveals defendant to be mildly mentally regarded with an

2

IQ of about 69.

3

be punished by execution.

4

As a matter of law, such a person may
This is all pre-Atkins.

So one statement has to be read in the light

5

of what was its significance, and it wasn't the

6

conclusive factor at the time of that motion.

7

MR. BLUME:

Well, that was the claim.

His

8

claim was it violates the Eighth Amendment to excuse

9

people with mental retardation.

This was not -- this

10

was after the direct appeal.

11

conviction and he goes in and says, look, I've been sort

12

of tracking things since Atkins; States have -- adopt

13

new laws.

14
15
16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He now filed for post

Since Atkins, we're

talking about MR. BLUME:

I'm sorry, since Penry.

Since

17

Penry there have been new developments, and I believe

18

that a new consensus exists, the one that this Court

19

subsequently embraced, and it violates the Eighth

20

Amendment and the Ohio Constitution to execute persons

21

with mental retardation.

22

claim that the State conceded the fact of mental

23

retardation, and it was in response to that claim that

24

the State court found again Mr. Bies to be a person with

25

mental retardation.

And it was in response to that

41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

That wasn't in some question of the balance

2

of aggravating circumstances.

3

that you cannot execute me because I have mental

4

retardation.

5

That was a straight claim

And so I was really responding more to

6

Justice Souter's questions of judicial estoppel and was

7

it the same issue in this, and I think it clearly was at

that time in this particular context.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C. MIZER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MIZER:

First, with respect to the

15

judicial estoppel arguments and the State's purported

16

concessions, as Justice Ginsburg noted, the statement to

17

which Mr. Bies points was pre-Atkins, and Mr. Bies's

18

argument ignores that Atkins changed things in two ways:

19

one consequential, by enacting, by placing a categorical

20

bar on the States; and the second, definitional.

21

the reasons stated of our -- in our yellow brief at

22

pages 16 to 18, the judicial estoppel argument fails for

23

all kinds of reasons.

24
25

So for

But more to the point, judicial estoppel
shouldn't apply here also because the State, whatever it
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was saying at the time, was not talking about the

2

three-part post-Atkins definition of mental retardation

3

in Ohio.

4

Mr. Bies also argues that 2254(d)(2) is

5

enough to give support to -- to the Sixth Circuit's

6

grant of relief -- of relief here, but there are two

7

problems with that argument.

8

the Sixth Circuit disregarded the reasonable

9

determination by the State's postconviction court that

The first problem is that

10

the Atkins standard had never been applied.

11

problem is that we shouldn't even get to 2254(d)(2)

12

because there are legal problems with the Sixth

13

Circuit's reasoning that should have prevented it from

14

granting the writ under 2254(d)(1).

15

that there is not a legal problem because there was an

16

acquittal in this case, because the Ohio Supreme Court's

17

statement on direct review that Mr. Bies -- that Mr.

18

Bies's mild to borderline mental retardation merits

19

weight and mitigation was enough to entitle him to a

20

life sentence.

21

severe distortion of what this Court said in Sattazahn

22

about an acquittal.

23

The second

Mr. Bies argues

But that's not an acquittal, and it's a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Mizer, can I just get

24

one clarifying question?

The concession at page 160 of

25

the record, "The record reveals the defendant to be
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mildly retarded with an IQ of about 69," and then they

2

argue as a matter of law that he cannot be -- he may be

3

punished.

4

proceeding in the Ohio trial court, that the State

5

intends to argue that a person who is mentally retarded

6

with an IQ of about 69 may be executed?

7

Is it your position that the further

MR. MIZER:

No, Your Honor, the -- this

8

statement will be beside the point, and the question now

9

post-Atkins -

10
11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you'll offer evidence

to show that statement is inaccurate?

12

MR. MIZER:

The -- the question is, the

13

question posed in Atkins doesn't hinge so narrowly on

14

IQ.

15

on -- on postconviction review will now determine what

16

his IQ is.

IQ is one of the three elements, and so the experts

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand that.

The -

18

could well be different.

19

disagree with that statement insofar as it recites

20

facts?

21

mildly mentally retarded with an IQ of about 69?

22

understand you will argue that that's not sufficient to

23

-- to come within Atkins.

24

to challenge the accuracy of that factual statement?

25

But is it Ohio's intent to

That the record reveals the defendant to be

MR. MIZER:

I

But do you intend to say -

Yes, Your Honor, as the State
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

postconviction court stated in this case, that -- the

2

record evidence pertaining to IQ is not clear; and so

3

IQ, among all of the other elements of the mental

4

retardation, will be up for determination.
