CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

argument next in Case 07-6984, Jimenez v. Quarterman.
Mr. Goldstein.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
When the Texas courts in this case

11

reinstated the Petitioner's direct appeal, the Texas

12

Court of Appeals decided that appeal like it would

13

decide any other case on direct review.

14

petition for discretionary review in the Texas Court of

15

Criminal Appeals, which was denied, and it was

16

considered like any other appeal would be.

17

We filed a

The question presented by this case is

18

whether the final judgment that indisputably results

19

from those rulings triggers the one-year statute of

20

limitations to file a Federal habeas corpus application.

21

The statute that governs that question is reproduced in

22

the blue brief at page 1.

23

Section 2244(d)(1)(A) prescribes "a 1-year

24

period of limitation that shall apply to an application

25

for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pursuant to the judgment of the State court.

2

limitation period shall run from the latest of -- and it

3

identifies four dates, the first of which is "the date

4

on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of

5

direct review or the expiration of time for seeking such

6

review."

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And you don't think you

need to go beyond (A) to resolve the case?

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

10

Kennedy.

11

terms.

12

The

That's right, Justice

Subsection (A) resolves this case by its plain

Now, the Fifth Circuit decided this case -

13

this issue, I'm sorry -- in 2004 in a case called

14

Salinas, and it thought that the factual scenario of the

15

case was more logically covered by subsection (d)(2) of

16

the statute, which is on page 2 of the blue brief.

17

that provision is the tolling provision, and it says:

18

"The time during which a properly filed application for

19

State post-conviction or other collateral review with

20

respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending

21

shall not be counted toward any period of limitation

22

under the subsection."

23

And

And the Fifth Circuit's view in that Salinas

24

case was that the better way of looking at this is that

25

when the State post-conviction court awarded relief of
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

further direct review, all of that should be regarded as

2

part of the post-conviction process.

3

after -- three years after the Fifth Circuit decided

4

Salinas, this Court decided Lawrence v. Florida, and

5

Lawrence disposes of the Fifth Circuit's logic in

6

Salinas, because Lawrence says that when the

7

post-conviction court, here the Texas Court of Criminal

8

Appeals, issues its mandate the application for

9

post-conviction review is no longer pending.

But four years

And so

10

there isn't any reason to believe that Congress thought

11

this factual scenario was covered by the tolling

12

provisions of (d)(2).

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, does your

14

position depend upon the proposition that we are not

15

free to consider sort of a second direct appeal as part

16

of the collateral review process?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It doesn't depend on it,

18

Mr. Chief Justice.

19

because, as I have said in answer to Justice Kennedy's

20

question, you can resolve this under (d)(1).

21

just trying to explain why the Fifth Circuit, which

22

struggled with how to handle this scenario, was wrong in

23

thinking it was governed by the tolling provision.

24
25

We don't have to reach that question

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I was

I guess it

doesn't -- or does it really make a difference?
5
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if you view the direct appeal that is the result of the

2

collateral review process as part of the collateral

3

review process, that time is tolled.

4

your view and regard it as not final to trigger the

5

process until you have another final decision, it kind

6

of leads to the same result, doesn't it?

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And if you take

In many cases, but not all,

8

including this one.

The difference is that if you

9

regard this as governed by tolling, that the second -

10

what we will call for purposes of the argument, just so

11

we know, the second appeal, so the appeal that's granted

12

by the post-conviction report, if you regard the proper

13

way of reading 2244 to be you have to regard that as

14

being tolled and the start date is the dismissal of the

15

original appeal, if the State Petitioner seeks

16

post-conviction review more than one year after the

17

dismissal of the first appeal, his Federal time is done.

18

So, this -

But does that really

20

matter?

21

22

done within one year.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It is -- it is the case that

Congress wanted it done within one year.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

The question

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

presented by this case is one year of what?

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

So, there are four different

4

possible start dates.

5

was wrong in the Salinas case when it said that Congress

6

envisioned only a linear time period stopped only by

7

tolling that would run from the first disposition of the

8

case, because 2244(d)(1)(B), (C), and (D) are all

9

provisions under which the time can expire and then be

We know that the Fifth Circuit

restarted.

11

So, what we think Congress wanted when it

12

was picking start dates and the start date in (d)(1)(A),

13

the one that usually applies, is it wanted the State

14

courts on direct review to be done with the case, finish

15

it off.

16

start the State post-conviction process and when that's

17

done go on to Federal court.

18

Then the State petitioner will have one year to

The reason we think Congress wanted to

19

include the second appeal, the conclusion of the second

20

appeal, as the trigger is that what's going on in the

21

Federal district court is you are trying to decide if

22

the State court's disposition of the case is contrary to

23

clearly established law as established by this Court.

24

And you won't know that, you won't even know what the

25

Federal district court is supposed to be reviewing,

until the conclusion of the second appeal.

10

Criminal Appeals, which is their highest court in

11

criminal cases, denies review, then it's logical for the

12

time period to start.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the background of this

14

case, Mr. Goldstein, is that in fact he didn't know the

15

first time that his appeal had been dismissed.

16

didn't know that his lawyer had filed an Anders brief.

17

But when he found that out, he waited some four and a

18

half years.

19

He

So why isn't the -- Texas right

20

when it says look at (B) and (D), they would have fit

21

his case?

22

from the date that he found out.

23

four and a half years.

24

have to consider is (A); you said that in answer to

25

Justice Kennedy.

He could have used those to get time starting
It wouldn't give him

But why -- you say we, all we

But why shouldn't we say that either
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(B) or (D) fits his case?

2
3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay, can I answer that

question, Justice Ginsburg, in two parts?

4

First most directly, I want to explain our

5

position with respect to (B) and (D) and then I want to

6

discuss the broad thematic concern that's raised by our

7

case.

8

is the prospect that multiple State defendants will take

9

more than a year, and I would like to deal with that

Here's the troubling fact by our case, and that

10

thematic point and explain why I don't think that's a

11

concern.

12

But to start directly with your point, (B)

13

and (D), assuming that they apply for a moment, will

14

only accomplish the following -- and then I want to

15

explain why I don't think they would apply.

16

they apply, what they would do is defer the start date

17

of the one year.

18

after -- 11 months or so after the Texas Court of

19

Appeals erroneously dismissed the Petitioner's first

20

direct appeal without giving him the opportunity to file

21

a pro se brief, he found out.

22

But even if

So on the facts in this case, one year

On the State's view, the one-year Federal

23

habeas corpus time would be deferred for 11 months, and

24

that is a very generous defendant-favoring position for

25

Texas to take in this Court.

If it then starts, it

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doesn't -- that reading does not accomplish what

2

Congress wanted in 2244, because the State prisoner,

3

though the time will have been deferred for a year, will

4

still have to file for Federal habeas corpus within a

5

year, notwithstanding the fact that he will get a second

6

direct appeal.

7

So he will be proceeding in both courts.

8

His start date will have been deferred for 11 months,

9

but he nonetheless one year later must appear in a

10

Federal district court in Texas, even though on

11

post-conviction review in the State courts he is sent

12

back to direct review.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, but is that

14

right?

15

friends on the other side would do, the period of direct

16

appeal as part of the collateral review process?

17

I mean unless you count, as I gather your

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's correct.

And that's

18

the argument about Lawrence.

That argument is not

19

sustainable in light of Lawrence.

20

have their argument exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice,

21

the State's position is, as the Fifth Circuit held in

22

the Salinas case, that when you get relief on

23

post-conviction review and you are sent back to the

24

State system, (d)(2) continues to apply, but that is not

25

correct.

Just to say that you

The tolling stops, and that is because, as
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Lawrence held, the application which is his

2

post-conviction application in the State court, saying

3

that I was deprived of my right to appeal, is no longer

4

pending.

5

its mandate.

6

the application of (B) or (D) that we don't think

7

Congress could have intended.

8
9

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has issued
So that's why this anomaly arises under

Now, Justice Ginsburg, there is a second
part to my answer, and that is the specific point about

10

whether (B) and (D) do by their terms apply; and here we

11

are in the anomalous position that if, again, Texas is

12

arguing very defendant-favoring readings of (B) and (D)

13

and I, representing the habeas Petitioner, am in the

14

unusual role of questioning whether these later start

15

dates apply.

16

But here our -- the lower courts I think it

17

is clear would say that (B) and (D) don't apply.

18

take you to the textual -- the text of the statute,

19

again, (B) appears at the bottom of page 1 of the blue

20

brief; and that has a start date of the date on which

21

the impediment for filing an application created by

22

State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of

23

the United States is removed, if the applicant was

24

prevented from filing by such State action.

25

lower courts, as we explained in our brief, pretty
11
Alderson Reporting Company

To

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

uniformly conclude that the failure to give a defendant

2

notice that his appeal has been dismissed is not an

3

impediment created by State action to him filing a

4

Federal habeas corpus application.

5

to grapple with our unusual facts has -- would

6

substantially broaden the application of subsection (B).

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so their attempt

What about the State

8

convicting, penalizing the defendant despite the fact

9

that his constitutional right to competent counsel

10

was -- he lost that right because of the failure of

11

notification?

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

13

regarded as an impediment.

14

lower courts take quite literally that there has to be

15

an impediment.

16

what an impediment is deal with the situation where a

17

prison warden, for example, does not allow you access to

18

the prison mails or somehow access to the legal

19

resources you in order to be able to file it.

20

21

It's just -- it's not

(D) is even easier, I think, and that is the

22

deadline starts from the date on which the factual

23

predicate of the claim or claims presented could have

24

been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.

25

And the reason the State is not right about that
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

provision and does not even really seriously argue it is

2

that the claims referenced in (D) are the claims that

3

are presented in the Federal habeas corpus application.

4

Here that's the claim that he had ineffective assistance

5

of trial counsel and that the judge was biased against

6

him.

7

was denied the right to an appeal.

8

there is no textual basis to say that the later start

9

date would apply under (D).

They are not the claim that he received -- that he

10

And so it just -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is this just a

11

dispute about the label?

Because Texas chooses to call

12

the proceeding that you get if you are successful on

13

collateral review a second direct appeal, you would

14

count finality one way; if they just switch the label

15

and say that is the collateral review appeal process,

16

then you would agree with them?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, sir.

We think that you

18

have to look at substance.

19

use in a footnote in our reply brief addressing this is

20

whether the proceeding has the hallmarks of direct

21

review.

22

South Carolina and Delaware, in which you can raise your

23

claim on post-conviction review that you were deprived

24

of your right to a direct appeal.

25

As -- the language that we

2

We haven't found a case in which they actual

3

4

States deal with this problem the way Texas does, and

5

that is the relief that you get is that you are sent

6

back into the direct review system.

7

it's covered quite plainly by the text of (d)(1).

8

that direct review is over, direct review concludes by

9

its plain terms.

10

And then we think
When

Now, Justice Ginsburg, I had said that I

11

wanted to come back and deal with the thematic problem

12

that might concern the Court about our case, and that is

13

the prospect that we will have defendants filing State

14

post-conviction applications more than a year late,

15

which could trouble the Court.

16

indicated, Congress had a concern with moving this

17

process along.

18

As the Chief Justice

In addition just to the plain text of the

19

statute which we think is controlling, there are I think

20

three points.

21

principles that get these State prisoners to file their

22

applications in a timely way.

23

majority of States that's set by a number of years.

24

some States like Texas it's applied by the principle of

25

laches.

The first is there are State limitations

Now, in the great
In

And the important point and the reason we are
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

here today is that Texas, for whatever reason -- and the

2

time limitations are intended to protect Texas here -

3

decided not to assert that his State post-conviction

4

application was untimely.

5

granting of relief to the Petitioner at all.

It didn't object to the

6

The second reason, in addition to the

7

State's own limitations period, is that the AEDPA

8

one-year limitations period has real force.

9

great majority of cases in which a State defendant is

In the

10

going to allege that he was deprived of his right to an

11

appeal and raise that claim on State post-conviction

12

review, he's going to lose that claim.

13

States don't give this stuff out like candy, and the

14

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is not, you know,

15

constantly reinstating defendant's appeals.

16

defendants know that.

The -- the

And

And unless you prevail on this claim, you

20

21

quickly.

22

And so you have

And the third is just the general notion

23

that defendants in non-capital cases don't have a real

24

incentive to just delay before instituting a State

25

post-conviction review.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

What -- what is

point of clarification?

I do think that the Court's opinion could

24

make clear that this anomaly arises from the fact that,

25

despite the fact that the Texas courts have made clear
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that there are laches principles and limitations -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask if laches is

3

something that the Texas court could bring up on its

4

own, or is it for the State to raise or not as it

5

chooses?

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It is for the State to

7

raise, and we cite our Texas authority for that in our

8

reply brief, Justice Ginsburg.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is the State statute that

10

allows the early conviction to be set aside and the

11

appeal reinstated -- do we have that statute?

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Kennedy, that is

13

section 11 -- article 11.07.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15
16

I thought I had it.

Do we

have it in MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I do not believe you do.

17

And the reason is that article 11.07 is just the general

18

Texas post-conviction regime.

19

used for reinstating direct appeals is developed through

20

caselaw, not by statute.

21

The procedure that is

Justice Scalia, there was a final point that

22

I was about to make when I said, look, defendants in

23

non-capital cases have every incentive, if they want to

24

get relief, to move their cases along.

25

concerned about capital cases where there is the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

The Court may be

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

opposite concern, that defendants will try and keep

2

their cases alive, if you will.

3

this point and has a deadline by statute that is quite

4

short for instituting post-conviction relief in capital

5

cases.

6

And Texas recognizes

They simply recognize that laches is the way

7

to handle the prospect of delay in non-capital cases.

8

We don't think there is any reason for this Court to

judgment of the Texas court that the judgment is not

curiosity, a prisoner's lawyer doesn't take the appeal,

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I have to ask one question,

sir, because the answer is it depends.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.
The question is, when he

files for Federal habeas corpus the first time in your

hypothetical, I take it he doesn't raise the claim -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No.
He raises a substantive

5

claim, like the judge was biased against him and the

6

like?

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

9

Yes.
That is regarded as a first

the judgment did not arise until later.

11

a case like that has arisen.

I don't believe

I doubt that one -- I mean,

The strange thing is that it

11

Your hypothetical, Justice

Oh, forget my hypothetical.

15

States, and the way it happens in Federal courts as well

You say:

something the court did or something my lawyer did, and

19

then you get to pursue your appeal.

The way that this thing

You file a post-conviction application.

I was denied entirely my right of appeal by

And that's what Congress wanted the Federal

21

district court on habeas corpus to review.

22

logically, the one year begins to run after that's done.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So

Well, except that

24

you kind of elide the point that Congress and AEDPA

25

quite clearly wanted these federal claims to be brought
21
Alderson Reporting Company

1

within a year.

2

to trump the one-year requirement.

3

This seems to allow the State processes

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, in many cases,

4

Mr. Chief Justice, of course, the State appeals can take

5

20 years to go up and down and back and forth from State

6

post-conviction review.

7

commonplace case in which a defendant doesn't file a

8

notice of appeal at all, as in Justice Breyer's

9

hypothetical, but the court of appeal says, you know,

We also have the rather

10

for good cause we are going to let you file this appeal

11

late.

12

And it's quite clear in that scenario, so

13

your appeal is reinstated there, too, because you were

14

20 days late, 30 days late on the filing deadline.

15

quite clear and I think agreed in all of those

situations that, while Congress did want you to move

expeditiously, the question is move expeditiously from

finishing the conclusion of direct review.

20

It's

And it's from the State court's direct review,

And we know that Congress recognized that

21

that wouldn't always be one year from the end of the

22

case the first time around from the structure of (B),

23

(C), and (D); and the fact that if there were a

24

tie-breaker at all, it is that the statute shall -- the

25

limitation period shall run from the latest of several
22

1

days.

2

would be multiple possible start dates.

3

So Congress quite clearly contemplated that there

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You said that it's

4

unusual for the Texas State to grant these.

5

presumably you could challenge the determination five,

6

ten, 15 years later by the Texas court not to grant you

7

a direct appeal.

8
9
10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

But

I'm not sure I understand

the -- the hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice.

If -- if

you lose your post-conviction application for it?

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah.

Let's say

12

this fellow -- the State court says, well, you know

13

what, we are not going to give you another direct

14

appeal.

15

violation of my federal constitutional rights.

16

happens then with respect to federal habeas?

17

And he says, well, that decision was made in

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

What

Well, he is challenging his

18

original -- Federal habeas corpus is reviewing the

judgment in his case.

22

23

He has, since there was only one

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But is he

24

challenging the first conviction, or is he challenging

25

the failure of the State court to give him another
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

direct appeal?

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

He is challenging the fact

3

that he was denied a direct appeal, which is a challenge

4

to his actual conviction.

5

in his conviction.

6

of the direct review, not from anything related to

7

post-conviction review.

8
9

That is a constitutional flaw

And so it runs from the conclusion

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's I

gather if he is granted the collateral -- the direct -

10

second direct appeal.

What if the Court says no, we

11

don't agree that you were denied your right to a direct

12

appeal; we think you had it so you don't get another

13

one.

14

violation of the Federal Constitution.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And he says that determination has been made in

The fact that the State

16

post-conviction court did not remedy a violation of his

17

constitutional rights on direct review does not create a

18

new constitutional violation.

19

violation in your hypothetical arises on direct review.

The constitutional

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, doesn't it

21

depend upon the allegation he wishes to make?

22

comes in in one of these proceedings four and a half

23

years later and says, you should give me another direct

24

review, I didn't have it.

25

we're not going to give you one.

Say he

And the court says, well, no,
And he says, well, you

24
Alderson Reporting Company

give it to all the white criminal defendants and you are

2

not giving it to me, so that violates equal protection?

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I don't think so.

And if I

4

could just explain -- give an analogy.

5

make the same allegation about ineffective assistance of

6

trial counsel.

7

your claim as the post-conviction court violated my

8

constitutional rights by not vindicating my original

constitutional rights, my right to constitutionally

I guess my

hypothetical supposes a new constitutional violation.

16

And I am just suggesting that the fact that Texas

doesn't grant this relief freely doesn't mean that

that's a sufficient answer with respect to the abuse of

federal habeas.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN D. JORDAN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

MR. JORDAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

Congress's commitment to preventing

8

unnecessary delays in the filing of Federal habeas

9

claims is reflected in section 2244(d)(1)'s strict

10

one-year limitations period.

11

inmates who wait for years before seeking

12

post-conviction review would obtain a new Federal

13

limitation start date when an out-of-time appeal is

14

awarded.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And it did not intend that

Well, why should that be,

16

given the fact that the day it is going to run from is

17

the day that -- which the State of Texas is willing to

18

take action.

19

ride as long as it rode here, why shouldn't the one-year

20

statute apply?

21

And if Texas is willing to let the matter

In other words, I guess what I'm saying is

22

the -- the decision about what is appropriate, that,

23

in effect, would start this period running, is Texas's

24

And as long as Texas is -- is satisfied with it, why

25

does AEDPA have an independent concern?
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. JORDAN:

Your Honor, the reason is that

2

in (d)(1)(A) Congress set a uniform Federal rule for

3

finality.

4

the period of direct review ends by the conclusion of

5

direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking

6

direct review.

And that finality date is either when the -

7

So when that happens, by statute, Congress

8

has said that the (d)(1)(A) finality date is attached.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but that -- in effect,

10

I think that begs the question, because if -- if Texas

11

says:

12

recognize a direct appeal starting -- or a direct-appeal

13

right exercisable now, then (d)(1)(A) applies by its own

14

terms exactly at the -- at the conclusion of the process

15

which Texas has at this date chosen to allow.

16
17
18

Okay, we are going to -- we are going to

Texas doesn't have any gripe.

It decided it

ought to act, and -- and, undoubtedly, it should have.
As long as the -- as long as the State is

19

protected, why is there an independent interest in

20

enforcing AEDPA, or enforcing the shortest possible rule

21

under AEDPA?

22

MR. JORDAN:

Justice Souter, there is an

23

independent Federal interest that the Court has

24

recognized consistently in avoiding abusive and

25

unnecessary delay in the filing of Federal habeas
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3
4

claims.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah, but we are -- we are

concerned about State interests, aren't we?
MR. JORDAN:

Certainly, Justice Souter, and

5

comity and finality are important purposes of AEDPA.

6

But another recognized and important purpose of AEDPA is

7

to avoid, you know, abusive and unnecessary delays in

8

the filing of Federal habeas claims.

9

court would allow stale claims years later to be heard,

So even if a State

10

that doesn't mean that Federal courts need to hear those

11

claims 10, 15 or 20 years later.

12

But there is a second point, Justice Souter,

13

that -- that is a problem with interpreting (d)(1)(A) in

14

the manner the Petitioner suggests, which is that it

15

will make it far more difficult for Federal courts to

16

administer that statute.

17

interprets "direct review" to bring in Texas and all the

18

50 States various remedies for ineffective assistance of

19

counsel on appeal, then what that means is you are no

20

longer going to have a uniform Federal rule for finality

21

in any of these cases.

22
23

Because if the Court

What you are going to have is a patchwork of
-- of various dates, and the -- the reality is -

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you have got a -- in

25

a sense, you have got a patchwork now.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean not -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not every State rule for the commencement of a direct

2

appeal in the normal course is -- is identical.

3

-- we start with a patchwork.

4

MR. JORDAN:

So we

But the difference is stark,

5

Justice Souter, because the -- the dates that the States

6

use for deadlines on initial direct appeal, the vast

7

majority, are within a short timeframe, 20 days to

8

90 days, the vast majority.

9

out-of-time appeals are genuinely varied, and they vary

10

over time in the States.

11
12

Whereas, these remedies for

And if I could give you a couple of examples
--

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But aren't they -- and I

14

will -- you know, I will take the examples, but I mean,

15

aren't they varied because the -- the circumstances of

16

error which led to these late appeals vary, too?

17

isn't that exactly the way it ought to be?

18

MR. JORDAN:

And

Well, it is correct, Justice

19

Souter, that some States -- the remedy varies with the

20

type of ineffective assistance of counsel, for example,

21

the difference between not filing a notice of appeal or

22

not filing a brief.

23

But my point is that those remedies -- the

24

Petitioner's brief -- opening brief at pages 29 to 32

25

says:

This is going to be easy for Federal courts to
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

apply, because what they can do is look at these six

2

different aspects of the nature of the remedy in each

3

State, and they can determine from that whether -

4

when -- whether it should be a new start date or just

5

tolling.

6

The CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can't we leave

7

that -- and you suggest that it is a Federal rule.

8

not sure that's right.

9

to the States?

Why don't we just leave that up

I am not -- if I don't accept your

10

friend's determination that this is a matter of

11

substance rather than form, States have it -- excuse

12

me -- within their control.

13

another direct appeal.

14

I am

Here -- your State calls it

Why don't we just take them at their word?

15

And if they don't want to get into the business of

16

having a Federal review of a second direct appeal that

17

they choose to allow, they just call it something else.

18

Call it a -- you know, the collateral review of a

19

successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel

20

and file whatever.

21

wouldn't count as a new final judgment.

22

And then, you know, under AEDPA that

MR. JORDAN:

Well, it's -- it's true, Your

23

Honor, that the -- that States can fashion whatever

24

remedy they want.

25

finality interests, it is going to be a responsibility

And in terms of the comity and

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the States if they want to change their law.

2

because in -- in these out-of-time appeals -- and most

3

of the States' remedies look somewhat like in -

4

somewhat like Texas in the sense that they are coming

5

through post-conviction review and they -- they are

6

awarding another, if you will, chance for the inmate to

7

assert his claims.

8

to strain the interpretation of (d)(1)(A) to protect the

9

State's interest -

10

But

There is not a reason for the court

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why -- why is it a strain?

11

I mean suppose that Texas decided to give every criminal

12

defendant convicted one thousand years to appeal.

13

know, if they did, I guess they would have one more year

14

after that to go to Federal habeas, right?

15

MR. JORDAN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

You

That's true, Your Honor.
Okay.

Then what's the

17

difference between that, giving them a thousand years,

18

which I doubt they will do, and what they have said

here?

time limits shall be calculated as if the sentence had

been imposed on the date that the mandate of this court

They said for purposes of the Texas rules all

There they are.

The Texas Supreme Court

24

gave him all that time, it's whatever it was, and said

How, how is that different

3

MR. JORDAN:

It's true, Your Honor, that the

4

-- that the -- the Texas court made a decision to give a

5

remedy to this inmate that was meant to duplicate the

6

type of claims he could have raised on direct appeal.

7

Our position is that does not change the finality date

8

under (d)(1)(A), because by statute, Congress has said

9

that that date attaches at the -- at the expiration of

10

direct review.

11

language -

12

And -- and the natural reading of that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I -- I was

13

just going to stop you there.

14

starts to run at the expiration of direct review.

15

says on the date the judgment became final.

16
17

MR. JORDAN:

It

That's correct, Your Honor, and

it says, it became final by -

18
19

It doesn't say that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- by the conclusion

of direct review.

20

MR. JORDAN:

Or the expiration of the time

21

for seeking such review.

And the importance there, Your

22

Honor, is that it -- it anticipates one of two events

23

occurring.

24

Congress understood that in some cases there wasn't

25

going to be a conclusion of direct review.

In other words, the natural reading is

32
Alderson Reporting Company

There was

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going to be an expiration of time for seeking review.

2

And at that point finality would attach.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though, as in this

4

case, it turned out he found out within a year.

5

suppose he didn't find out for more than a year; that

6

is, he didn't find out that -- that the appeal had been

7

filed, and he didn't find out about the dismissal?

8

because either his counsel or the State blundered, he is

9

out in the cold, and he can never present his direct

10

But

So

appeal claim.

11

MR. JORDAN:

Not necessarily, Justice

12

Ginsburg, and that's the reason why Congress already

13

provided exceptions in the statute in the form of

14

subsections (b) through (d) that provide later start

15

dates for extenuating circumstances beyond the inmate's

16

control.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Goldstein just

18

explained to us why those two provisions, the (b) and

19

(d) would not work.

20

That this -

MR. JORDAN:

I understand, Your Honor.

And,

21

respectfully, I disagree -- I disagree with that, and

22

here is the reason why (d)(1)(B) applies.

23

applies because in -- for example, in this case you had

24

the -- a finding that there was constitutionally

25

ineffective assistance of counsel to the extent of
33
Alderson Reporting Company

And (d)(1)(B)

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

abandoning the inmate on appeal.

2

And this Court's precedent has said that

3

when there is -- in the trial or on direct appeal, when

4

there is ineffectiveness of counsel that amounts to

5

abandonment, that winds up being imputed to the State

6

because it means that the State got or -- or kept a

7

conviction by the violation of the inmate's due-process

8

rights.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have a case

10

to cite for that?

Because I understood your friend to

11

say the opposite:

That wouldn't count as an impediment.

12

MR. JORDAN:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14
15

I do How do I resolve

that dispute?
MR. JORDAN:

I do, Your Honor.

You -- you

16

need -- need to look no longer than the case that is

17

cited in both briefs.

18

is cited in the Petitioner's brief at pages 27 and 37,

19

and it is cited in our brief at pages 36 and 37.

It is Evitts versus Lucey, and it

20

It is also in another case not cited in the

21

brief, but it is also noted in Coleman versus Thompson.

22

In other words, the Court has consistently said that

23

where there is constructive denial of counsel that

24

amounts to no assistance at all and the State thereby

25

obtains and retains a conviction, there -- that will be
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

imputed to the State.

Now, the difficult part in

2

getting (d)(1)(B), a later date under (d)(1)(B), is that

3

you also need the causal connection, because you can't

4

just have the ineffective assistance of counsel.

5

also has to have caused the inmate not to be able to

6

file his -- his timely Federal habeas.

7

this case because the ineffective assistance of counsel

8

resulted in the inmate having a lack of notice.

It

That happened in

The

10

and he gave the wrong address to the court.

12

and the inmate didn't know.

13

So the

That's why we say in those circumstances

14

(d)(1)(B) is implicated.

15

even if we measure the date from September of 1997 or we

16

give him a new date under (d)(1)(B), then that's the

17

date that he admits, he acknowledges, he knew his State

18

appeal had failed.

19

half years to seek any type of post-conviction review.

20

And then -- and the importance of that is that Congress

21

intended to give a year, a strict one-year period.

22

inmate could have invoked (d)(1)(B) and he did not and

23

he waited four and a half years from the date he could

24

have had.

25

But it's worth noting that

From that date, he waited four and a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And Texas could -- and

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Texas could have gone into the State court and said:

2

Don't give him the direct review; he waited four and a

3

half years after he -- but the State didn't ask for

4

that.

5

MR. JORDAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

6

The State did not assert a laches defense, but I have -

7

there is two points on that:

8

-- there is one case and it's cited in the brief, Ex

9

parte Carrio.

One is that the only case

It's cited in the Petitioner's brief.

10

There's one case in the last 150 years of Texas

11

jurisprudence where laches has actual been asserted and

12

an appeal has been -- I'm sorry -- habeas has been

13

denied based on that.

14

And we are not talking about -- we are not

15

asserting laches here.

16

of his Federal limitations period under a Federal

17

statute.

18

clearly not diligent, and this inmate could have had a

19

later start date, but even from that later start date

20

he would -- he would -- the Federal period would have

21

expired.

36
Alderson Reporting Company

The reference was

decision in Lawrence.

2

because the situation in Lawrence was different.

3

And that's -- that's not true,

In Lawrence, the Court's decision said that

5

in the Florida courts.

6

7

to.

8

Court with a cert petition, could that cert petition

9

count as tolling time of review for the State

10

He had gone all the way to the

There was no State court left for him to go

And the question was, when he then came to this

post-conviction review?

11

The Court said no.

That's not the case here.

This is more like

12

the Court's decision in Carey versus Saffold, where in,

13

Carey, the Court said -- the Court acknowledged that

14

under California law where inmates can, if they lose

15

their habeas in a lower court, they can then file an

16

original writ in a higher court.

17

while the inmate is going through that process, the

18

collateral review of the underlying judgment remained

19

pending, it remained in continuance.

20

The Court said that,

And that's what's happening here.

If you

21

look at what happened in the Texas court, when the

22

inmate files his habeas petition, the habeas petition

23

itself is not reviewing the pertinent judgment.

24

the language of (d)(2), "reviewing the pertinent

25

judgment."

That's

That habeas petition asks for a second
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

proceeding to review the pertinent judgment.

2

can you give me another proceeding, the out-of-time

3

appeal, to review the pertinent judgment?

4

the inmate receives that, when he -- if he gets the

5

out-of-time appeal, then the next step, the out-of-time

6

appeal, is where the judgment is reviewed.

7

It says,

And so, when

So, the Court's rationale in Carey is

8

applicable with even greater force here because the

9

State courts have told him:

File another -- you know,

10

continue your proceeding so you can get review of the

11

underlying judgment.

12

process.

13

is the remedy portion of the habeas proceeding in Texas.

14

And that's why the (d)(2) tolling does work and Lawrence

15

does not defeat that.

16

the inmate, if he had acted timely, he could have filed

17

his State post-conviction petition.

18

an out-of-time appeal, he could -- the tolling would

19

have gone on while -- throughout the out-of-time appeal.

20

And then if he had lost that, he could have then gone to

21

Federal court.

22
23

And it anticipates a two-step

So you might say that the out-of-time appeal

And in this case, that means that

If he had obtained

And so -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you're saying that

(2) has a negative implication.

24

MR. JORDAN:

I'm sorry?

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You are saying that (2)

should be counted if it's not pending and you are not

MR. JORDAN:

In other words, the time

That's -- well, that's correct,

6

Your Honor, in the sense that if the State -- some

7

collateral review in State court has to be pending for

8

tolling to be going on.

9

for the out-of-time appeal process in Texas, it does

And what we are saying is that

10

remain pending.

11

that first habeas petition is asking for, and if the

12

inmate gets it is receiving, further collateral review

13

of that judgment because -

14

The reason it remains pending is that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you say "the

15

first habeas petition" you mean the first State habeas

16

petition?

17

MR. JORDAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

MR. JORDAN:

Okay.

I'm sorry.

And that first State habeas

20

petition -- if you look -- if you look in the record,

21

you will see the State habeas petition doesn't challenge

22

anything about the underlying judgment.

It doesn't say,

23

give me relief on any particular claim.

What it says

24

is, give me an out-of-time appeal proceeding so that I

25

can challenge the underlying judgment.
39
Alderson Reporting Company

And so, when the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

inmate obtains that out-of-time appeal to -- to get

2

review of the underlying judgment, (d)(2) tolling still

3

applies.

4

And that CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

What do

5

you mean, "(d)(2) tolling still applies"?

6

direct appeal time does not count against his one year?

7

MR. JORDAN:

That's correct.

That the

The

8

out-of-time appeal time, Your Honor, won't count.

9

what we'll go on is that if his habeas was granted and

10

he was allowed the out-of-time appeal, he could pursue

11

the out-of-time appeal.

12

limitations period under (d)(2) would remain during that

13

entire time, if he then loses his out-of-time appeal and

14

he comes out of the other side of the process.

MR. JORDAN:
response.

Your Honor, two points in

The first is that -- is that I'm assuming, in

10

your hypothetical, that it is an inmate who has

11

attempted to be diligent, has attempted to contact the

12

court.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. JORDAN:

Right.

Right.

And if he has attempted to

15

contact the court and he still had not found out, the

16

circumstances -- I mean, we've looked at a lot of these

17

cases and there is just very few out there where an

18

inmate who is being diligent is not going to be able to

find out one way or the other.

20

wasn't able to, he might fall under (d)(1)(B).

21

he didn't, Your Honor, and it was an unusual -- and it

would have to be a very unusual circumstance -- it might

be that equitable tolling could apply.

find out the facts.

7

It requires an impediment to have been removed.

MR. JORDAN:

He just didn't

Well, presumably, Your Honor,

the reason that he didn't would have -- if he was being

diligent, if he was -- because he needs to be diligent.

He can't just sit in his cell -

-- and say, "I'm not going to

15

then probably something has happened, either, you know,

through the State system or through the attorney.

of these cases.

But the

his appeal, you know, and time passes; doesn't take it.

2

Then, five years later, he learns for the first time and

the first time he could have learned that his lawyer

tore up the notification.

5

into play.

At that point, (1)(B) comes

So the year begins to run.
Then, in your idea, he has -- he has a year

to go to Federal court.

But wait, it's tolled while he

8

goes to State court.

9

just learned it.

And now he's under (2) and he files a

10

habeas in State.

Now the remedy of the State habeas is

11

to reopen the direct appeal.

12

since it's a remedy of a habeas, as if it were a

13

continuation of the habeas and therefore it would fall

14

within (2).

So he goes to State court having

But we should count that,

That's your argument.

MR. JORDAN:

Exactly.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I do

not think there is any case ever considered that to my

MR. JORDAN:

No -

-- and the only difficulty

21

of it is that you have to take a sort of leap of faith

22

of some kind in attaching what everybody's calling the

23

direct appeal as if it were actually part of the State

24

habeas proceeding.

25

your argument.

That's I think the hardest part of

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There is more of a problem

2

than that, as the other side just said.

3

is the gimmick you are using to get out of this, doesn't

4

speak of not being able to find out in time; it speaks

5

of the date on which the impediment to file an

6

application -

(1)(B), which

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

(D).

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- is removed.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not (B), it's (D).

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, you said (D), not (B).

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

(D).

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I thought,

13

Counsel, that your response to that was when you have a

14

failure of counsel, that that is imputed to the State.

15

So it is a removal of an impediment created by the

16

State.

17

MR. JORDAN:

That's -- that's correct,

18

Mr. Chief Justice.

That's -- under the Court's decision

19

is cases like Evitts v Lucey, if there has been a

20

constructive denial of counsel, an abandonment of

21

counsel to the degree where there was effectively no

22

appeal, then that could be imputed to the State.

23

reasoning has been that it's because the State was able

24

to get or keep a conviction without the inmate having

25

due process.

The

That would be -- the inmate would still
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have to have the fact that that impediment actually

2

caused him to -- and this case is a good example.

3

Even though this inmate -- you know, there

4

was ineffectiveness of counsel -- if the court had the

5

right address, and court had sent him the judgment, then

6

there would not have been the causal connection; he

7

wouldn't have been able to get the (d)(1)(D) date.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The problem with (1)(D) is

that the claim or claims presented that is referred to

10

in (D) is not the denial of the appeal.

11

or claims that he wants to bring in his Federal habeas.

12

That's why (1)(D) doesn't work, you have to go back to

13

(1)(B).

14

I'm talking to you.

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17
18

It's the claim

But I think it's a good

point.
MR. JORDAN:

Well, you are exactly right,

19

Justice Scalia, that (d)(1)(D), in this case, because it

20

is claim-specific it only does apply to the ineffective

21

assistance of counsel on appeal.

22

that it was implicated, but because he got relief on

23

that claim in the State court, there was no reason for

24

him to -- so he wouldn't have -- the (D) was implicated

25

but didn't need to be asserted.

We noted in our brief

45
Alderson Reporting Company

We are that saying (d)(1)(B) -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. JORDAN: -- is -- is -- in play in the

this -

Between your response to

9

MR. JORDAN:

It's the interplay of these two

10

-- of these two provisions, because both of them in any

11

particular case could be in play.

12

example, this inmate had not gotten relief in the State

13

court for his ineffectiveness of counsel on appeal, then

14

the (d)(1)(D) could have provided a later start date for

15

that claim.

16

claims.

17

our position is that it cannot be that Congress intended

18

in this -- this statute to be interpreted such that a

19

non-diligent inmate who waits four and a half years

20

after he knows his appeal has failed to seek any sort of

21

post-conviction relief will obtain a new start date.

If the -- - if, for

It's (d)(1)(B) that applies to the other

And the -- you know, the bottom line notion for

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's your fault.
Justice could have -- not

24

only, that don't some States have a limitation period

25

when -- when he finds out that his appeal has been
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

dismissed, without notice to him, aren't there some

2

States, criminal justice systems, that say from the date

3

that you had knowledge, you have X days to file?

4

MR. JORDAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

There are a

5

number of States that have -- if we are talking about

6

remedies for ineffective assistance of counsel on

7

appeal, there are a number of States that have

8

deadlines; but there are at least 19 States that provide

9

remedies for ineffectiveness of counsel on appeal with

10
11

no statute of limitations.
And in -- and in those States and in many

12

cases what that means is that the inmate, like this

13

inmate, could come five years later, ten years later,

14

and make those claims.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, do I understand

16

correctly that, based on your answers and your friend's

17

answers, there is no difference between the way you two

18

in substance read these provisions?

19

(d)(1)(A); you rely on the combination of (d)(2) and

20

(d)(1)(B) and (d); except in the situation where you

21

have a non-diligent prisoner, and in that case, his

22

theory leads to a different result than yours.

23

He relies on

He excuses the non-diligence because the

24

State chooses to label the second opportunity as final.

25

You do not excuse the non-diligence because in the
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

absence of diligence, (d)(1)(B) and (d)(1)(D) do not

2

apply.

3

MR. JORDAN:

4

Justice.

5

the reply brief, about -

6

That's correct, Mr. Chief

And I'd like to address a point that's made in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Then it comes down

7

-- it does come down to his, where he began his

8

argument, which is he said that this is an unusual case

9

where Texas is being overly generous to convicts,

10

because you choose to label it as direct appeal and

11

therefore that means someone that the States allow to

12

have another direct appeal, even though they have been

13

non-diligent, get the benefit of the -- of a new

14

finality date.

15

MR. JORDAN:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

16

our position is that Texas -- not Texas or any State can

17

rewrite the -- this Federal statute and a finality date

18

in this Federal statute.

19

the point that's made in a reply brief that the Court

20

not worry about this because there is no incentive for

21

non-capital inmates to -- to sit on their rights.

22

have two points I want to make on that.

23

But I want to address quickly

And I

The first is Congress has already made that

24

decision.

Obviously Congress was concerned that even

25

non-capital inmates could sit on their rights because
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they imposed this strict one-year limitation on

2

non-capital inmates.

3

practical matter this happens in many, many cases.

4

These cases provide the example.

5

inmate waited five years.

6

that is coming out of the Fourth Circuit on an

7

out-of-time appeal, the inmate -- a non-capital inmate

8

waited ten years to seek post-conviction review.

9

these are cases that we think are representative of many

But the second point is that as a

In this case the

The Frasch v Peguese case

And so

10

case that would come through the district courts, and

11

that in fact non-capital inmates, whatever their

12

incentives may be, do as a practical matter sometimes

13

sit on their rights.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Convicted felons don't

always make intelligent decisions, you are saying.

16

MR. JORDAN:

That's correct.

And the

17

problem is that when -- when for whatever reason they

18

sit on their rights ten or 15 years, our point is that

19

that doesn't mean they can come back in and have Federal

20

courts hearing stale claims that should have been

21

brought, if the inmate was being diligent, years

22

earlier.

23

And there's -- and this case is a case in

24

point.

This inmate has -- has provided no reason why -

25

no legitimate reason why he waited four and a half
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

years.

The only reason he provided was I am a pro se

2

inmate and I -- I don't know what the law S.

3

can his data in the joint appendix pages 109 to 112, and

4

those are directly rejected by the court in the Johnson

8

underlying merits of the basic claims, that each -- his

11

He's probably not a very

-- he's not -- has the greatest in the world of

succeeding, I wouldn't suppose.

15

of cases, that really most of them heard are pretty

16

frivolous?

17

MR. JORDAN:

Your Honor, a lot of them are.

18

A lot of them are, and in fact there were two Anders

19

briefs filed in this case.

20

claims were, when he got the out-of-time appeal, he was

21

22

So you had two attorneys in this case who said -

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What strikes me about the

case is we are fighting about the limitations and

25

whether it applies and so forth; you probably could have

17

aren't Texas State opinions rejecting claims of laches.

What the Texas courts have made is that the Texas A.G.'s

about (d)(1)(B) and (d)(2), all of which, I think

52
Alderson Reporting Company

in the case.

2

came back to the point about whether this is an

3

impediment, and my friend kept answering it is State

4

action, and the Court would say, but is it an

5

impediment?

6

But Justice Scalia and the Chief Justice

And at page 20 of our reply brief we must

7

cite eight or ten cases, three of which notably are from

8

Texas; there were litigated by the Texas Attorney

9

General's office, that make it clear that the failure to

10

give the notice of the opinion is not an impediment to

11

filing post-conviction review, and the Court would be

12

rewriting a lot of habeas corpus law to rule for the

13

State of Texas here.

14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about -- he

cited most prominently the Evitts case.

16

MR. JORDAN:

That's a State action, but as

17

the Court's questioning indication, the question is, is

18

State action that is an impediment to filing a Federal

19

habeas petition, and all of our cases answered that

20

question.

21

The final point is about (d)(2) and my

22

friend says that this isn't like Lawrence v Florida,

23

because here there is more proceedings.

24

holding was this, and it was unambiguous:

25

time to seek cert starts to run, that's when the

2

post-conviction application is no longer pending; and

3

when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals decided the

4

Petitioner's claim and said he had an out-of-time

5

appeal, it issued its mandate and the mandate is in the

10

the case on the basis of label or substance, but it is

11

12

what we have been calling the second appeal.

13

retroactivity does not apply; all the constitutional

14

rights that are announced in the meantime apply; you

15

have a right to a counsel; the usual standards of

16

post-conviction relief in terms of having us show an

17

extra layer of prejudice don't apply.

This is just like any other appeal the Texas

19

Court of Appeals and the courts of criminal appeal would

20

decide and that makes it a (d)(1) case.

Thank you very much.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

25

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:58 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
