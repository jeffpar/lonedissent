ON BEHALF OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY, ET AL.,

10

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

13

MR. JOSEFFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For more than 30 years, EPA has construed

14

the Clean Water Act to permit it to consider the

15

relationship between costs and benefits in setting

16

limits on water intake.

17

unprecedented limitation of that discretion is wrong as

18

a matter of basic Chevron interpretive principles for at

19

least three reasons.

20

The court of appeals'

First, the controlling statutory standard,

21

which looks to the best technology available for

22

minimizing adverse environmental impacts, is ambiguous

23

and does not preclude EPA's interpretation, especially

24

in light of the statute's other "best technology"

25

provisions, two of which expressly require consideration
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the relationship between costs and benefits.

2

Second, there is no indication that Congress

3

determined for itself that the benefits of stricter

4

regulations would in fact outweigh their costs.

5

Instead, from the context -- I'm sorry, for -- I'm

6

sorry.

7

the history of the statute that Congress determined for

8

itself that the benefits of stricter regulations would

9

in fact justify their costs.

10

There is no indication in either the context or

Instead the indication is

that Congress left that to the agency.

11

Congress took a very careful look at the

12

separate issue of the discharge of pollutants and

13

legislated numerous very specific provisions concerning

14

the discharge of pollutants.

15

intake, the Congress gave scant attention to that at all

16

and included only this one very general provision in the

17

act on that subject.

18

But when it came to water

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, in the

19

other provision it specifically required consideration

20

of costs and benefits and it didn't do so in this

21

provision.

22

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

In our view, that

23

strongly supports our view that, first, Congress

24

understood that consideration of cost and benefits was

25

not incompatible with the application of a best
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

technology standard.

2

required that consideration as part of the best quality

3

standard, which seems to show at a minimum that a best

4

technology standard does not unambiguously foreclose

5

consideration of the relationship between costs and

6

benefits.

7

Otherwise it would not have

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you to follow up

8

on that, because your statement about compatibility

9

raises what for me is a fundamental difficulty in

10

understanding this case.

11

both to Chevron step one and step two.

12

this:

13

whatever else subsection (d) had in mind, it was

14

imposing some kind of a technology-driven standard

15

criterion.

16

And I think my difficulty goes
And that is

I think we all start from the premise that,

It's there in the words.
The difficulty that I have is if you are

17

going to apply on at least a site-specific basis a cost

18

benefit analysis, I'm not sure how it would work.

19

other words, it seems to me that when you're talking

20

about the possible harm from pulling in a few fish or a

21

few plankton or a few baby clam larvae and so on, as

22

against the cost conceivably of millions of dollars for

23

extending intake pipes or putting technical expensive

24

filtering mechanisms, you are dealing with such

25

incommensurables that I don't know how on a site
6
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

specific basis you would sensibly apply a cost-benefit

2

analysis.

3

dollars?

Are a thousand plankton worth a million
I don't know.

4

And my difficulty then is, I don't know how

5

it would work.

6

work, it seems to me that if you are going to apply a

7

cost-benefit analysis, the odds are what you are going

8

to do is basically eliminate the whole technology-driven

9

point of the statute.

10

And because I don't know how it would

So that's my difficulty.

Can you

help me out on that?

11

MR. JOSEFFER:

Two points on that.

The

12

first is that this is how it's always been done.

13

mean, since 1977 at least, first permitting decisions

14

have always been done on a facility by facility, case by

15

case basis.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I

Do we know so far as intake

17

pipes are concerned?

I mean, maybe I'm being foolish in

18

thinking it's a little easy to make sense of it when

19

we're talking about toxic discharges, but leaving that

20

aside, do we know that, with respect to these kind of

21

intake technology decisions, that the cost-benefit

22

analysis has been in any way sensible?

23

maybe what Congress had in mind was this just doesn't

24

work doing it on a site-specific cost-benefit analysis

25

and that's why we're going to pass subsection (b) in the
7
Alderson Reporting Company

In other words,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

first place.

2

with cost-benefit analysis.

3
4

So you say, well, we've had experience

MR. JOSEFFER:

What's the experience?
Sure.

I guess now I have

three points.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.
The first is that -- the

7

first is that the history here is, that I was referring

8

to, is with respect to cooling water intake structures,

9

where for more than 30 years cooling water intake

10

structures have been determined on a case by case basis,

11

where EPA determined as early as 1977 and ever since

12

that it would be unreasonable to impose -- to require

13

the use of technology whose costs were wholly

14

disproportionate to its benefits.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And have these been

16

applications of something more than the outside

17

standard, which I guess everybody agrees would apply in

18

a case like this, that when it just becomes wholly or

19

outrageously disproportionate there wouldn't be -- that

20

there would in that sense be a cost-benefit cutoff?

21

These have been more subtle decisions than that?

22

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.

And I mean, just the

23

phrasing of the standard, whether costs are wholly

24

disproportionate to benefits, itself indicates that

25

there is a comparison here.

We cite in our brief one
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

particular -- in our reply brief, one specific example

2

where benefits were clearly not de minimus.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Second Circuit

4

recognized that latter kind of taking account of costs

5

disproportionate, more than the industry would bear, and

6

they also recognized a cost comparison.

7

cheaper method that is almost as good, you can use that

8

and you don't have to use the one that will capture the

9

extra fish.

If you have a

So everybody agrees that there is some

10

consideration of cost.

11

the concern is, as Justice Souter says, that you are

12

comparing things that aren't comparable.

13

The question is how much, and

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, first off -- I'm sorry.

14

I guess one basic point is just that -- first off,

15

excuse me, in terms of the court of appeals' recognition

16

that costs and benefits could be compared in extreme

17

circumstances, that just deprives it of the logic of its

18

position, because when we talk about the extent or

19

degree or manner to which a permissible consideration

20

can be considered that's a classic manner for the

21

agency's gap-filling discretion, not something for the

22

court of appeals or Respondents to get discretion on.

23

And, second, in terms of the concern that

24

the cost-benefit analysis can be difficult because we're

25

comparing benefits that are not easily monetized to
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

economic costs, that is just systematically the case

2

with all cost-benefit analyses, even ones which people

3

do in ordinary life.

4

for this amount or a more expensive TV for a different

5

amount, I don't know exactly how in my head I quantify

6

that, but I do.

7
8

When I decide whether to buy a TV

And with respect to cost-benefit -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't it easier to quantity

that than the value of a plankton?

9

MR. JOSEFFER:

Not -- well -- but with cost

10

benefit analyses, again, this is routinely done by

11

agencies.

12

The statisticians and the economists JUSTICE SOUTER:

It is -- let me -- I will

13

grant you that agencies purport to do this kind of

14

thing.

15

question is, does it make any sense in these

16

circumstances to think that you really can do a cost

17

benefit analysis?

18

purporting to do it but it really doesn't make a lot of

19

sense, then it either means that there is just going to

20

be an irrational process going on, or it means that the

21

technology-driven standard basically is going to be read

22

right out of the statute, because you are always going

23

to find some disproportion which is going to limit your

24

use of technology.

25

But my question and I think Justice Ginsburg's

And if the answer is no, we have been

MR. JOSEFFER:

I think the most irrational
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

thing would be to just throw up one's hands and say that

2

we are going to impose standards whether or not they do

3

harm more harm than good, whether or not they make any

4

sense.

5

considered the relative costs and the relative benefits

6

and also did so in a way that puts its thumb on the side

7

of the environmental side of the scales.

8
9

And -- and here the agency very carefully

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But just to get back

to your television hypothetical, if you told somebody

10

that you were going to buy the best TV available nobody

11

would think you meant that you were going to buy a very

12

cheap TV because, considering the costs and benefits,

13

that was the best one.

14

to get the fanciest TV you could.

15

They would think you are going

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, these words have

16

different meanings in different contexts, which just

17

underscores their ambiguity.

18

as a whole, if I said I was going to acquire the best

19

technology available for winterizing my lawnmower so

20

that it would work again in the spring, the best

21

technology available for winterizing a $400 lawnmower

22

would not be $500 fluid, because when one's talking

23

about protecting something it's intuitive to think about

24

the value of what's being protected.

25

But taking the phrase here

And again, Congress by expressly requiring
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cost-benefit analysis for some of the pollution

2

discharge limits was expressly contemplating exactly

3

what seems to concern you, Justice Ginsburg -

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does it make any

difference MR. JOSEFFER:

-- that costs would be traded

against benefits.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You have the two labels:

The BP, "best practical," and then "best available."

10

And isn't it so that the best available technology,

11

thinking of the Clean Air Act, what they call "BAT," is

12

considered the most technology-forcing standard and then

13

there are lesser standards?

14

these can be -

15

MR. JOSEFFER:

But you seem to think that

All of these words can have

16

different meanings.

17

provisions that are expressly cross-referenced in this

18

provision, the one that's most informative here is the

19

best conventional pollutant control technology, because

20

Congress expressly required cost-benefit consideration

21

in determining the best conventional pollutant control

22

technology and "best" is the only word in that phrase

23

that is amenable to a cost-benefit reading.

24
25

I think of the four best technology

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think maybe what

Justice Ginsburg was beginning to get at is my question
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

here.

I assume that BTA is the most rigorous of the

2

standards set forth in the statute.

3

that assumption, but grant me the assumption for the

4

moment.

5

standards, what is it in the regulations that reflects

6

the agency's concurrence with that?

7

the agency regulations that indicates that there is a

8

more rigorous examination under BTA than the other

9

standards?

10

You can argue with

If BTA is more rigorous than the other

MR. JOSEFFER:

What is there in

Well, to be clear, the agency

11

does not think and therefore did not in its regulation

12

presume that the best technology available for

13

minimizing adverse environmental impact was more strict

14

than the other standards.

15

on that.

16

the other ones, establish their goal to be the

17

elimination of discharges, whereas here this provision

18

says that its goal is to minimize.

19

is a more measured standard than the others.

20

Just two commonsense points

The pollutant discharge standards, which are

So on its face this

And, second, as a practical matter, there is

21

no reason Congress would want greater protection for

22

fish through intake structures than for people through

23

the discharge of pollutants.

24

Congress enacted all of these provisions in 1972, and it

25

provided at that time that in determining pollution

I mean especially --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discharge, even including toxic pollution discharge, EPA

2

was required to consider the relationship between cost

3

and benefits up until 1989.

4

And it makes no sense to think that Congress

5

would have wanted stricter standards for fish here than

6

for people under the toxic discharge provisions.

-- or one -- one of the other standards?

Why didn't it use BPT or

Well, because these are all

One thing that -- two thing are

2

than all of the others -

3
4

One is that this standard is different

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If they are different,

then one is either less rigorous or more rigorous.

5

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

But there is no

6

reason to presume this one is more rigorous, especially

7

considering -- first -- I mean, the words here -- it

8

uses important words here it did not use elsewhere.

9

Here we have "best technology available" -

10

"best technology available for minimizing adverse

11

environmental impact."

12

the examples earlier demonstrated, is not necessarily

13

the way that most singlemindedly pursues a goal at all

14

costs and without regard to all of the consequences,

15

which is why -- for example, if you were talking about

16

the best way to get home, it would not necessarily be

17

the most direct route if that required payment of a

18

toll.

19

And, first, "best," as some of

Similarly, "minimize" is also an -- and,

20

again, Congress used "best" to mean that in "best

21

conventional pollutant control technology," because that

22

is the only word there that is amenable to our reading.

23

And, second, "minimize" is also an important

24

word, because "minimize" has two perfectly common and

25

ordinary meanings.

One is to reduce to the greatest
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

extended possible.

2

reduce to some lesser, reasonable level.

3

The other in ordinary usage is to

So if I said, for example, that I was trying

4

to minimize the risk of being hit by a car today, I

5

presumably would not mean that I was staying inside at

6

home all the time.

7

consistent with other needs, including economic ones,

8

like the need to travel to work, I was being prudent.

9

Instead, it would mean that,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if it "available to

10

reduce"?

"For minimizing" is no stronger than if it had

11

said "available" --

12

didn't it read "available to reduce"?

13

MR. JOSEFFER:

if it meant what you suggest, why

Well, elsewhere in the Clean

14

-- in the Clean Water Act, Congress clearly did use

15

"minimize" to mean a reduction.

16

a, quote, "drastic minimization of paperwork," Section

17

33 U.S. Code 1251(f), then a "drastic minimization" has

18

to mean a drastic reduction, which is a perfectly

19

ordinary meaning of the word.

20
21

If Congress called for

"Available" is also relevant because,
Justice Ginsburg, as you mentioned earlier -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"Reduce" in any event is -

23

is not -- is not the same as what you are arguing.

24

are arguing reduce to the maximum extent reasonably

25

possible.

You

The word "reduce" alone doesn't convey that.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The word "reduce" would just mean, you know, if you -

2

if you knock it down any amount, you have reduced it.

3

But you are saying "minimize" requires more

4

than that.

5

reasonably possible.

6

It means reducing it to the maximum extent
Isn't that what you are saying?

MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

We -- we construe --

7

think the other side might take that view of -- of

8

"minimize."

9

to reduce -

Our view is that "minimize" means you have

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. JOSEFFER:

Just to reduce.
-- a reasonable -- refers to

12

a reasonable reduction.

13

in this context would probably not be reasonable.

14

I

And so some minimal reduction

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't understand that to

15

be your position.

You -- you don't think that

16

"minimize" even means that you reduce it to the maximum

17

extent reasonably possible?

18

MR. JOSEFFER:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

Well, I guess it depends You think any reduction

constitutes minimizing?
MR. JOSEFFER:

No, because it does have to

22

be a reasonable reduction, which would not be -- in this

23

context would not be a trivial one.

24

we may -- we may agree, depending on what one means by

25

"reasonable."

Reasonableness -

"Reasonableness" tends to connote a
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

consideration of -- of all relevant factors.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.
And so when we're talking

4

about a reasonable reduction, we are going to talk about

5

a reduction that is reasonable in light of, among other

6

things, the relationship between costs and benefits.

7

we may agree if that's what we both mean by

8

"reasonableness."

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So

Let me say it again and you

10

tell me whether you agree.

11

meant the meaning of "minimize" was is that you reduce

12

the -- the harm to the maximum extent reasonably

13

possible, not merely that you reduce it to some extent.

14

I had thought that what you

MR. JOSEFFER:

I think that's right with -

15

with "reasonably" entailing a consideration of -- of the

16

relationship between costs and benefits.

Of course, "reasonable"

includes everything.

not do that, then this is not -- you're backing away

24

from Chevron.

25

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, here's -- here's how we
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would say it, Your Honor.

There may be some locations

2

where that -- where it would not be wholly

3

disproportionate.

4

design an alternative system that would protect, for

5

instance, a balanced population of fish in that water

6

body, then it might be that -- that -- that

7

closed-cycled cooling would be required.

If -- if for some reason you couldn't

8

But on a national basis, at 355a the agency

9

said that they understood that reducing impingement and

10

entrainment at the ranges they were talking about would

11

not be justified in many locations across the country.

12

And that's because power plants may be impinging numbers

13

of fish that aren't actually harming that water body.

14

Fish have the potential to procreate in very substantial

15

numbers.

16

so, if the -- and throughout the act, even under 316a,

17

for instance, Congress has said that, even with respect

18

to thermal discharges, you can get variances if you can

19

show that you are not harming a balanced population of

20

fish in the water body.

21

Some fish spawn 500,000 eggs in a year.

And,

So given that, given the variances

22

throughout the act and even these kinds of limits on the

23

discharge standards, which are designed to protect human

24

health, why would you read the mandate for the maximum

25

technology on intake structures which has nothing to do

MR. LAZARUS:

Let me explain our position,

EPA has no authority in any circumstance to

So EPA never has the authority, in any context, to weigh

costs against benefits.

they're suggesting is not because Congress has that -

Whether

the word "available" can extend to cost feasibility

13

can be -- allow EPA to compare costs and benefits, to

weigh one against the other, that's a completely

different question.

-- what they were doing in 1972, was Congress -

It's -- it's they can't

Right.

It's -

But -

And for reasons that But if the only question,

when you say they can consider costs, are you saying

10

they are simply asking whether it is economically

possible for the industry to afford this, regardless of

12

whether it's any good or not?

13

MR. LAZARUS:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

this is what Congress is faced with.

that something that cannot be taken into account?

MR. LAZARUS:

If

If it can be reasonably borne

any other judgment.

And if I can, Your Honor 42

Can't make any other

judgment.

So imagine the consequence of that

environmentally.

4

Suppose the EPA is right:

5

plants, huge plants, purely to save the fish; and the

6

result is the cost of electricity goes up, and the

result is there are no electric cars, because people

make the comparison with oil, and now they have to have

They can't make any other judgment.

I mean, it's very hard for me to believe that

10

Senator Muskie would have written a statute that would

11

have foreseen such an effect.

12

MR. LAZARUS:

Right.

I think because such

13

an effect wouldn't happen.

What Senator Muskie and

14

Congress was worried about in 1972, Your Honor, was they

15

were worried about the possible underregulation.

16

worried about overregulation.

17

you gave EPA the authority to weigh costs against

benefits, you would have systemic underregulation and

the regulatory process bogged down by -

JUSTICE BREYER:

They

And their concern was, if

That's exactly where I

21

agree with you.

So I go back to page 170 of the

22

legislative history, which I have read now six times,

23

and I agree with you that it is not totally clear.

24

Maybe you think it is.

25

saying there is just what you've said:

But it seems to me what he is

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Don't go into

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this with some elaborate thing, but remember costs are

2

still relevant.

3

throughout is a set of words that would help me

4

translate that thought into a legal reality.

5

And what I've been searching for

MR. LAZARUS:

And going back to Justice

6

Souter's statement a moment ago, which I agree with,

7

what Senator Muskie's distinction he wanted to draw was

8

to allow EPA to engage in cost analysis as to

9

feasibility, money in the bank, but not to make that

10

value judgment of what's worth what.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And Well, if you get to

12

that money in the bank, does this mean that best

13

technology available changes over time?

14

the industry could have borne these costs two years ago,

15

but they probably can't today.

16

bank today.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. LAZARUS:

I mean, maybe

Nobody has money in the

It certainly does depend, and

19

this is how EPA does it, not just in this area but

20

throughout all the technology-based performance

21

standards, looking at availability.

22

industry revenues, barriers to entry, and decides

23

whether or not this technology is available.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

EPA looks at

So you think they

could have said, two years ago, this is what you have to
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

do, but today they would say you don't have to do that

2

anymore -

3

MR. LAZARUS:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

It's quite possible -- even though the

technology is still available.

6

MR. LAZARUS:

Notice -- notice -- not

7

economically.

Notice in this case, what the Second

8

Circuit said in remanding was EPA may be able to justify

9

the same decision on availability basis, but they didn't

10

make that determination here.

What has happened for the

11

past 30 years, which is how I -- counsel over here

12

posited the case -- what has happened over the last 30

13

years is the EPA has ignored the statutory language and

14

it engaged in this wholly disproportionate analysis as a

15

result, which has led to the very kind of

16

underregulation that Senator Muskie was worried about,

17

and that is that they had never looked to see whether

18

closed-cycle cooling is in fact available, economically

19

available.

20

They've just kept from going Phase I through cycle

21

cooling.

MR. LAZARUS:

That's right.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What about if it bankrupts

three firms?
MR. LAZARUS:

If it bankrupts three firms -

13

if one looks how EPA has interpreted that historically,

14

Your Honor, throughout all the pollution control

15

statutes, the Air Act, the Water Act, Resource

16

Conservation Act, EPA has said that itself is not enough

17

to say it's available for the industry, but it is

18

possible -- we don't doubt this -- it is possible -

19
20
21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it's not economically

available to those three firms.
MR. LAZARUS:

No, but here's what happens:

22

What the EPA said -- and you can see this in this

23

Court's decision in the Crushed Stone case, where the

24

Court drew this distinction.

25

seek a variance based on cost impact to them, if they

A particular facility can

46
Alderson Reporting Company

can show that the cost to them is much greater because

2

of some particular circumstances to them than it is for

3

the industry as a whole.

4

do that.

5

that they can do a cost-benefit -

6
7

EPA has long said it.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We don't question it,

No, but this -- they just

have -- they are just not quite as strong a company.

8
9

And this Court said they could

MR. LAZARUS:

No.

And that's the very

distinction this Court drew in the Crushed Stone case.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But is the variance a

11

matter of statutory right or -- or is it available under

12

a regulation?

13

MR. LAZARUS:

It's -- the way this Court

14

interpreted sort of the use of categorical standards in

15

the Dupont case, early on in the 1970s, the Court said

16

in that case that EPA can promulgate these kind of

17

technology-based performance standards on a categorical

18

basis -

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

MR. LAZARUS:

Yes.

-- but if they do so, they

21

have to take -- they have to give a variance possibility

22

because if a particular -

not satisfied by the result.

MR. LAZARUS:

justification for the cost variance.

The justification

10

for cost variance is not because of a sort of benefits

13

important distinction but not an easy one -- the only

14

way you can get a variance is if you can show the

15

assumptions EPA made about how much this would cost

16

don't apply to you because there is something different

17

about your facility, so it actually costs you much more.

18

You can get a variance for that.

revenues aren't strong."

that.

It's because if you can show -- if the only

lot, not just a little, the consumption of fossil fuel.

What they said here is that, if you

Well, now how are they not -- you seem to

be arguing that they can't take that into account,

which, for an environmental agency, I would have

thought, "But they must take it into account."

MR. LAZARUS:

We are not saying they can't

take that into account.

EPA has said they can.

6

Second Circuit said they could, and we agree.

here's how they could take it into account.

take it into account in deciding what will be necessary

to reduce environmental impact.

account those things that -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

The
But

They can

So they can take into

So if they did exactly the

12

same thing they've done, which I've just read you, and

13

they put a label on it, instead of saying "thinking of

14

benefits," we were calling it now "taking into account

15

environmental impacts," then they could do it?

16

MR. LAZARUS:

Well -- but they -- here's

17

what they could do, Your Honor, and I don't think there

18

is anything anomalous about this:

19

"Here are the factors we're going to take into account

20

in deciding whether or not we are minimizing adverse

21

environmental impact, and we have some authority to

22

decide what is and is not a relevant environmental

23

impact.

24

in deciding whether or not this technology, this cost,

25

makes it available or not."

The EPA can say,

We -- here the industry can take into account

They have authority here,

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

but once they decide whether technology is available,

2

once they decide what "environmental impact" means and

3

what it means to minimize, once they decided that, they

4

can't then say, "Well, we don't think these impacts are

5

worth those costs."

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see that thought, and

7

this is what's concerning me, but there may be a very

8

good answer.

9

have an enormous job to do.

A lot remains to be done with EPA.

They

And I wouldn't want to get

10

them tied up in unnecessary red tape, where everybody is

11

suddenly taking them to court on rather technical

12

things.

13

you call it, read out of the Muskie page 170 -- read it

14

out of the "available technology" definition, you can

15

take costs into account; just don't do it in this other

16

way.

So if this "grossly" or "wholly," or whatever

I can see how they could work with that.

17

MR. LAZARUS:

Right.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, I'm worried about what

19

you are saying that may make it so difficult for them

20

that they won't be able to do the job.

21

MR. LAZARUS:

Well, we are doing the exact

22

opposite now, Your Honor.

What we are trying to do is

23

say that the information that EPA has to focus on, the

24

way Congress constrained them, is limited and it doesn't

25

allow them to weigh one against the other.

What happens if -- and this is why Congress

2

didn't want to give EPA cost-benefit analysis authority

3

here or almost anywhere in the statute.

4

concerned that it would bog down the regulatory process,

5

and that is that if you actually had EPA -- had to come

6

up to this weighing of one to the other and try to weigh

these imponderables, you would be subject to such

MR. LAZARUS:

Congress understood
And sometimes one can

I agree.

And that's why they said, "We

it's -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, is the reason they

4

don't do cost-benefit analysis well because they are

5

forced to do it in a political atmosphere in which it is

6

difficult to make rational decisions?

7

the reason Congress would have come to that conclusion?

MR. LAZARUS:

Is that basically

I think that may be part, but

I don't think that's -

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

MR. LAZARUS:

Is that -

-- the real reason in 1972.

I

12

think that does happen.

13

was that Congress saw what happened before, and they

14

said, it turns out to be really hard in the water

impact.

17

better, more rational result if we instead say, here's

what you focus on, technology available, minimizing, and

don't try to compare.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I think -- I see your

point, but I think if I accept your point, all I am

22

doing is saying, they may in a kind of smoke and mirrors

23

way take cost-benefit analysis into consideration sub

24

rosa, when they decide what availability is going to

25

mean; and they make take it into consideration when they
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decide what a -- a -- an undesirable environmental

2

impact is; and that sort of gets the -- the weighing

process out of the public focus.

4

And if they do it that way, they -- they can

bring in just the considerations that Justice Breyer is

talking about, but they don't do it in an obvious way.

7

And I think that's what your argument boils down to.

8
9

MR. LAZARUS:

Well, I think argument boils

down to that they can focus on environmental impact,

10

decide what is and isn't environmental impact, they can

11

focus on availability, decides what costs are relevant

12

to that, and when is the technology available -

of decision they would make on a more specific basis in

19

a more highly charged political atmosphere, if they

20

engaged in the cost-benefit analysis that you say they

21

can't do?

22

MR. LAZARUS:

It may well be one reason why

23

Congress didn't want to compare one to the other, about

24

that charged atmosphere.

25

I don't think they are doing it sub rosa.

But what -- they can't do it.

What Congress is doing

systemically in 316(b) and throughout the Clean Water

2

Act is that Congress is saying we want to give EPA the

3

authority for cost feasibility; we don't believe in this

4

-- that it works with cost-benefit analysis because of

5

the weighing against one against the other.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it has -- it has

7

required, not just permitted but required cost-benefit

8

analysis in other areas.

MR. LAZARUS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what is your

response to the fact that it -- it seems ridiculous to

allow it, and indeed require it in effluent situations

13

where human health is at stake, and yet to forbid it in

14

this intake situation when you were just talking about

15

the snail darter.

16

What -- what's your response to that?

MR. LAZARUS:

Two responses, Your Honor.

17

The first is that in 1972, which is when 316(b) was

18

enacted, Congress did not allow cost-benefit analysis

19

for toxic pollutants.

20

regulated under section 301 and 304 of the statute.

21

They were not subject to best practicable technology;

22

they were not subject to best available technologies.

23

They were subject to a separate provision, and that this

24

section 307 at that time.

25

to the law.

Toxic pollutants were not

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And did that section 307

not allow cost-benefit?

3

MR. LAZARUS:

It did not allow cost-benefit.

4

The way Congress originally approached hazardous water

5

pollutants and toxic air pollutants, the Clean Water Act

6

is the same.

7

actually want you to do an assessment to figure out at

8

what level will it no longer be harmful to humans?

9

what they found out when they tried that, is they found

10

out, boy, that information is unbelievably hard to come

11

up with.

12

this incredible information, and the result was that EPA

13

did nothing.

14

they did nothing for air toxics.

15

learned how more information could lead to less

16

regulation, they said all right:

17

that.

18

technology-based performance approach in the first

19

instance, and then couple it with -- still keeping the

20

health-based as a backup, to be able to go past that.

They said EPA, this is so harmful that we

21

So they put the technology-based as the

22

first step and they kept the 307, but in 1972, Your

23

Honor, there was only one provision of the Clean Water

24

Act in which Congress delegated any authority to EPA to

25

compare costs and benefits; and that was under 301(b)(2)
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and 304(b)(2).

And in that provision they said until

2

1977 only, EPA for best practical control technology,

3

you can and you must do cost-benefit analysis.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. LAZARUS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel -

That's the only provision.
You would have to

agree, wouldn't you, that the panel's decision in this

case overruled the prior panel's decision in judge

9

Katzman's decision in Riverkeeper 1?

10

MR. LAZARUS:

No, they certainly didn't

11

overrule it for two different reasons.

12

the Riverkeeper 2 opinion, I think it's on 25a, note 11,

13

they explain that in Riverkeeper 1, dry cooling was

rejected because it was too expensive.

consideration.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you look at

That's an

ON BEHALF OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. JOSEFFER:

Thank you.

If I could start

10

where I left off, the fact that Riverkeeper 1 in their

11

view is wrong, I think does confirm what anyone would

12

conclude after reading the two opinions, which is that

13

they are not consistent.

14

demonstrate ambiguity.

At a minimum that helps to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's an ambiguity the

that so?

MR. JOSEFFER:

Now the government

Our -- our -- what we said

20

was we thought the court of appeals was dead wrong, that

21

it was a very important issue, but in the interlocutory

22

posture of this case, which was a remand, we did not

23

think that it was -- was so important as to warrant your

24

cert standards.

25

we were wrong about that.

Frankly, we were delighted to find out

59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The other point I need to make is that this

2

case is, after all, about the one sentence in the Act

3

that deals with water intake, not about all the other

4

detailed provisions about the discharge of pollutants,

5

which is important because about half of the last

6

argument dealt with the discharge of pollutants.

7

The fact that there is no list of factors

8

here, and instead just one general sentence, just

9

underscores that on this issue, Congress was delegating

10

especially broad authority to the agency to address a

11

problem that at the time was relatively novel, and that

12

legislative record confirms Congress itself did not give

13

any real weight to.

14

statements, thought I would not look to the floor

15

statement of Congressman Muskey concerning a different

16

standard, which was the BAT standard, but instead the

17

only floor statement that addresses this standard, and

18

it says that economic practicability is the test, and

19

everyone agrees that practicably considers costs and

20

benefits.

21

If we want to look at floor

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that was the House

22

side, which the House side was against that.

And the -

23

the question I have from your point of view is the -

24

the obverse question:

25

cost-benefit analysis, I mean, it goes through all these

if you look at this particular

60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

things which, they don't know what the numbers are,

2

nobody knows what the values of the fishes are, which

3

98% are never even eaten, they are fast swimmers or

4

whatever.

5

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the -- the -- you see

7

the point here.

8

opponent, brother here, seem to be manifest in this kind

9

of a document which, if you do read Senator Muskey,

10
11

That all of his fears, your -- your

seems to be the very things he was against.
So -- so what is -- I am still left with

12

your suggestion of what to do, other than just, "well,

13

it's all fine."

14

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, look -- first off.

15

What EPA did here was not among the most robust forms of

16

cost-benefit analysis.

17

the Court necessarily needs to expand -- to opine on the

18

outer limit here.

19

mentioned, it first created national performance

20

standards; second it did a variance when an facility's

21

costs are significantly greater than the benefits.

22

In other words we don't think

EPA did two things.

First, as you

So first in determining -- so -- well, the

23

second of those is easiest, because there is an obvious

24

thumb on the environmental side of the scales there.

25

Costs have been to be significantly greater than
61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

benefits, which is not all that aggressive.

2

Here, with respect to the nationwide

3

performance standards, EPA again did not just try to do

4

a strict -- costs are, you know, one penny greater than

5

benefits.

6

considerations.

7

of closed cycle cooling versus the technology it chose.

8

And then it -- it determined that those incremental

9

benefits were outweighed by a variety of other things,

Instead it weighed up a number of
It looked to the incremental benefits

10

including -- one was the extremely high costs of

11

closed-cycle cooling, three and a half billion; second,

12

the cost-benefit ratio, which was extremely

13

disproportionate; third, the energy impacts which you

14

mentioned are really quite significant.

15

We are talking about 40% of the Nation's

16

power supply.

17

percent and require 20 new plants to be built and

18

require each of those plants to be taken offline for 10

19

months while it's retrofitted, that's really a very

20

significant concern of EPA's.

21

air pollution.

22

If we are going to reduce that by 4

And then the fourth is

And so when EPA is weighing benefits against

23

all the other thing and is not purporting to assign

24

artificial monetary values to everything, I argue that

25

this just underscores that we are well within the
62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

agency's discretion here.

2

If I could also turn then to just the main

3

point.

One of the main points here is that I really

4

don't think Respondents have any logic to their

5

position, because when we are talking about the text

6

they say costs have to be considered against

7

affordability and not against benefits.

8

talking about absurd results, they say, oh sure, you can

9

consider costs against benefits, when it would otherwise

But when we are

10

be absurd.

11

gap-filling discretion to decide when where to draw that

12

line, and nothing draw a de minimis line in the statute

13

any more than the line EPA has drawn.
