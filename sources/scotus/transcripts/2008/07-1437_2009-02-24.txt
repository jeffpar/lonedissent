Mr. Rhodes.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. RHODES:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The single issue presented in this case is

12

whether the bar to review under 1447(d) is applicable to

13

a district court's discretionary decision to decline the

14

exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.

15

after the district court dismissed Respondent's federal

16

RICO claim, the district court remanded the remaining

17

state law claims under 1367(c).

18

based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because

19

jurisdiction was specifically conferred upon the court

20

by 1367(a).

In this case,

That was not a remand

21

It's been the rule for some 30 years that

22

the bar of 1447(d) is limited to the specific grounds

23

set forth in 1447(c).

24

are on page 2 and 3 of Petitioner's blue brief.

25

And for reference the statutes

Those two grounds are a remand that's based
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a remand

2

that is based upon any defect other than a lack of

3

subject matter jurisdiction if it's raised by a timely

4

motion for remand filed within 30 days of the notice of

5

removal.

6

this case is whether this remand is one that's based

7

upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

8
9

The only prong of 1447(c) that's applicable in

Now, Congress clearly conferred jurisdiction
on the district courts in 1367(a), where the case

10

contains a Federal claim and related State law claims,

11

and a remand based upon a court's discretion to decline

12

to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is not a remand

13

that's based upon the court's lack of subject matter

14

jurisdiction.

15

Jurisdiction either exists or it does not.

16

A district court's power to hear a case and its power to

17

decline to exercise jurisdiction are part and parcel of

18

the same thing.

19

district court cannot decline to exercise that -- or

20

cannot exercise discretion to decline to exercise that

21

jurisdiction.

22

Absent the power to hear a case, a

Now, in this Court's Osborn v. Haley case,

23

it made reference back to Carnegie-Mellon and also

24

United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, that even if only State

25

law claims are remaining in the case after the Federal
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

claim has been resolved, the district court has

2

discretion consistent with Article III to retain

3

jurisdiction over that cause of action.

4

Now, this is inconsistent with the Federal

5

Circuit's analysis in this case that a remand based upon

6

1367(c) is a remand based upon a lack of subject matter

7

jurisdiction because in its view an independent basis

8

for that jurisdiction is lacking.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't there something odd

10

about saying if it's really fundamental like the

11

presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction, that

12

is not reviewable?

13

the district court says, I lack subject matter

14

jurisdiction over, let's say, the RICO claim, as wrong

15

as that might be, that would not be reviewable, right?

16

It's not disputed, right?

MR. RHODES:

That if

Justice Ginsburg, I agree with

17

that, because if the court does say that I am remanding

18

this because, either rightly or wrongly, I lack subject

19

matter jurisdiction, then that would fall squarely

20

within 1447(c) and (d).

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Though that could be a

22

very grave error and yet, on a matter of discretion,

23

that that would be reviewable.

24

statutory argument, but it just seems odd to think that

25

Congress would want to be firm that if the remand is for

And I appreciate your

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

lack of subject matter jurisdiction, wrong or right, no

2

review, but it was a discretionary exercise, I could

3

keep this, but I choose not to, that that is reviewable.

4

That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to

5

say the judge could keep it or remand it, that that

6

action is reviewable, but the action of saying I don't

7

have jurisdiction, when indeed the court did have

8

jurisdiction, is just totally immune from review.

9

MR. RHODES:

I agree with you, Justice

10

Ginsburg, that that seems rather confusing.

11

address my answer in this way:

12

1447(d) arose in the situations where apparently

13

Congress wanted to -- to inhibit the abuse by those

14

seeking only to delay the case by filing a motion for

15

remand.

16

I would

The review ban of

For example, a case that is filed in State

17

court that clearly expresses no Federal question or

18

diversity issue, yet the defendant, in order to delay

19

the case, will then remove it to Federal court.

20

those situations Congress wants to prevent those kinds

21

of frivolous removals to Federal court.

22

In

But here in, our particular case -- and

23

maybe -- let me back up a minute.

Maybe we should look

24

at that in a different way, because even though you may

25

have a legitimate basis for removing the case to Federal
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court and the district court disagrees with you, perhaps

2

the better policy is that those types of remands should

3

not be reviewable, even though sometimes a district

4

court is going to get them wrong.

5

But in this particular case, there was a

6

Federal RICO claim asserted against us in state court,

7

and as a defendant we were not removing that case on

8

some frivolous basis.

9

were entitled to be in Federal court.

10

We were removing it because we

It was only after the district judge

11

dismissed the Federal RICO count --

and there was no

12

motion for remand on this case filed by Respondents -

13

the district court sua sponte decided that he was not

14

going to exercise his power to hear this case because he

15

thought there were legitimate State law claims and he

16

remanded on that basis.

17

remand and normally we would be arguing that where

18

discretion is exercised by a district court it should be

19

reviewable for an abuse of discretion.

Now, that's a discretionary

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But wouldn't it be -

21

here the district judge said:

22

claim; all that's left are State law claims, and there's

23

no Federal interest in this case any more.

24

State law claims, they belong to State court, good-bye.

25

I could keep it, I choose not to, because it isn't a

I got rid of the RICO

7
Alderson Reporting Company

They're all

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sound use of the resources of the Federal court.

2

Now, even if you're right that this is a

3

discretionary decision, so you can't say no jurisdiction

4

because the discretion implies that there is power,

5

isn't it 99 cases out of 100 that the court of appeals,

6

assuming reviewability, will say, we should defer to the

7

district judge about questions of this nature, the

8

district judge's decision that this isn't worth the time

9

of the Federal court?

10

MR. RHODES:

I'm not sure about the number

11

of percentage of cases that -- that there is going to be

12

a decision by the appellate court to say we shouldn't

13

interfere in that, Justice Ginsburg.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But wouldn't you -- as a

15

practical judgment, the Federal claim is gone, there is

16

pending jurisdiction or now supplemental jurisdiction

17

over the State claim, but the district court is told by

18

Congress:

19

And the judge gives one of the reasons that's

20

enumerated, that reason being that the State claims are

21

overwhelming in this case, the RICO claim is dismissed,

22

thinking it was worthless, so it's a State case.

23
24
25

It's your call; it's a matter of discretion.

Why would a court of appeals overturn such a
judgment?
MR. RHODES:

I think, Justice Ginsburg, I
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can give you an answer to that because there is a recent

2

case that's in our brief, the Brookshire case from the

3

Fifth Circuit, where the district court exercised

4

jurisdiction over Federal and supplemental claims, and

5

did that for quite a while and ruled on a number of

6

dispositive motions; and then basically on the eve of

7

trial, after resolving the Federal claim, remanded it

8

back to the State court.

9

The Fifth Circuit, because it had the

10

ability to review that, under the statutory

11

construction, was able to review that on the basis of an

12

abuse of discretion and said that the district court had

13

definitely abused its discretion.

14

jurisdiction for that length of time and then returning

15

it to State court, that was a waste of judicial

16

resources.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

After retaining

But that was because we

18

would have to retread the same ground in the State court

19

that had already been covered in the Federal court, but

20

that's not the kind of case that was presented here.

21

know the case has lingered for a long time, but there

22

was no processing of those State law claims.

23

concentrated on RICO, threw it out, and said "the rest

24

of the claims I'm not interested in."

25

The judge

So it's not a case like the Fifth Circuit
9
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where there was a large investment of Federal court

2

energy and time and sending it back would mean going

3

over once again what had already transpired in the

4

Federal court.

5

MR. RHODES:

That is true.

This case is

6

different because what the -- what the district court

7

had labeled as legitimate State law claims as to, for

8

example, inventorship, we argued are within the

9

exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court, and that is

10

why we appealed to the Federal Circuit in order to have

11

that issue resolved.

12

Here, if we went back to State court we

13

would be in the position of having to argue that the

14

State court -- that the State court lacked jurisdiction

15

to hear that claim because it was something that was

16

within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court.

17

It seems that in this particular situation it would be

18

better to have the Federal Circuit to pass upon the

19

exclusivity of the inventorship issue under the patent

20

laws rather than to have to go back to State court and

21

work back up through the State court system to have that

22

resolved.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could you explain why

24

that is a Federal question?

It's a dispute over the

25

ownership of this invention, right?
10
Alderson Reporting Company

So it's not a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question of the validity of a patent or infringement of

2

a patent?

3

two parties are disputing about ownership.

4

why does that become a Federal case?

5

It's just the invention is like any res, and

MR. RHODES:

Why is -

It became a Federal question

6

because in our view it arose under the patent laws

7

because when they filed their complaint, even though

8

they couched it in terms of purely State law claims,

9

they did allege that we had falsely claimed to be the

10

inventors; and the basis for that claim that we falsely

11

claimed to be the inventors was the oath and declaration

12

that was filed in connection with our patent

13

applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

14

So what they were raising was an issue with

15

respect to our ability to claim to be the inventors of

16

what we claimed in our U.S. patent application.

17

Therefore, since that falls squarely under our

18

entitlement to -- to inventorship, of what we claim to

19

be the inventors, under Article I, section 8, it seemed

20

to us that that clearly fell within the exclusive

21

jurisdiction of the Federal court.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just ask one sort of

23

a preliminary question?

If we just applied the plain

24

language of 1447(d), then this case was properly

25

remanded; the remand order is not subject to review.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that correct?

2
3

MR. RHODES:

Yes.

If we just read 1447(d)

on its face, that's -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What really prevents us

5

from reaching that decision in this case?

6

actually it's an open question because you were both

7

arguing about it here and you certainly disagree.

8

couldn't we just simply say for this particular category

9

of remand orders, we'll just apply the plain language of

10
11

Because

Why

1447(d)?
MR. RHODES:

That would be going against the

12

rule that was set out in Thermtron that 1447(d) was

13

limited to only the specified grounds of 1447(c), which

14

are lack of -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand it would be a

16

modification of the dicta in Thermtron, but why wouldn't

17

that be a simple solution to this case?

18

MR. RHODES:

I'm not sure that would be a

19

simple solution to this case, Justice Stevens, and the

20

reason for that is that if we -- if the Court decides to

21

do that, then we return to those areas where total chaos

22

could really break out, and the reason for that is that

23

we would be in a situation where district courts can -

24

can dress up in language that is lack of subject matter

25

jurisdiction and remand cases, knowing that there is not
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going to be any review.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, no, that wouldn't

3

avoid the plain language of the statute.

4

district court orders wouldn't avoid the plain language

5

of the statute.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Pretextual

But the I think there's no

8

need to dress up anything.

I mean, as Justice Stevens

9

point, you wouldn't have to dress up anything; if you

10

send it back, it's not reviewable.

11

MR. RHODES:

If we were to read 1447(d) just

12

plainly on its face without -

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How could we do that in

14

light of Thermtron?

15

text of the statute that says remands are not

16

reviewable, period; and in Thermtron the Court said, yes

17

they are sometimes, if we think it's so outrageous for a

18

district judge to say:

19

this case, but my docket is so crowded, and this is a -

20

this is a small-change case; it belongs in State court.

21

The court, I think, was outraged by a district court

22

thinking that it could dump a case simply because it was

23

too busy with more important things.

24
25

Thermtron went against the clear

Yeah, I've got jurisdiction over

That was the setting of Thermtron, and to
reach the result that the court reached, the court had
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to go against the language of the statute when read in

2

absolute terms.

3

then they gave a rationale for what the new test was

4

going to be.

5

no longer -- remands are not reviewable; it's going to

6

be -- that applies only to the cases where -- what was

7

it, subsections (c) and (d) of 1447?

8

court read the statute to say less than it in fact did.

9

That's what Thermtron did.

10

But anyway, the court did that, and

It was no longer going to be remands are

MR. RHODES:

The -- it -- the

That is the exact holding of

11

Thermtron, that they were not going to construe that so

12

woodenly to allow a district court to abdicate its

13

mandatory jurisdiction.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, "woodenly" is

15

a bit much.

16

what it says.

17

I'm not going to take this because I'm too busy with

18

other things.

19

unusual situation, couldn't it?

20
21
22

I mean, they're going to read it not to say
And Thermtron involved the court saying:

I mean, it could be limited to that

MR. RHODES:

Mr. Chief Justice, it could,

but CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it would solve

23

the problem Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, that

24

this way you don't get to appeal big things like no

25

subject matter jurisdiction, but you do get to appeal
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

picayune things.

2

MR. RHODES:

Again, I'm not sure how we

3

would divide those up between big things and picayune

4

things.

5

30 years of this particular rule under Thermtron being

6

uniformly applied by all the circuit courts of appeal,

7

and they have found this to be a workable, statutory

8

interpretation to give them a framework to handle these

9

kinds of cases.

But I think, to answer your question, we have

And it's not a situation where the

10

circuit courts of appeal have run away from situations

11

like this, where remands have been based upon declining

12

to exercise discretionary power to send it back to State

13

court.

14

statutory framework to review those kinds of cases.

They have seemed to want to work within the

15

And I think it would be a large departure to

16

go back and try to modify what all the circuit courts of

17

appeal, except for maybe the Federal Circuit, had

18

adopted as a workable framework in order to solve these

19

kinds of problems.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, one clear way to do

21

it would be to overrule Thermtron, but neither party has

22

asked for that.

23

side hasn't asked for it.

24
25

You haven't asked for it and the other

MR. RHODES:

That's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You just have to

2

distinguish Thermtron.

You don't have to overrule it.

3

You'd still apply it on its facts.

4

That's a very different problem.

When the

5

judge says, I'm too busy to hear this, I'm going to send

6

it back to State court, that's what Thermtron resolved.

7

Here -

8

MR. RHODES:

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's not involved here.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your concern is what

10

And yet -

11

was the Court's reasoning, and you could apply the

12

Court's reasoning, its interpretation of 1447.

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You have to get rid of

Quackenbush, too, don't you?

15

MR. RHODES:

Yes, Quackenbush is a -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. RHODES:

Throw that overboard, too?

We would have to overthrow that

18

as well, and the reason for that is because Quackenbush

19

was a remand based upon -- an abstention-based remand

20

under Burford, and in that case, this Court found that

21

abstention-based remands did not fall within either

22

prong of 1447(c).

23

very little attention in Quackenbush before it moved on

24

to the 1291 issue.

25

So -- in fact, this Court gave that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
16
Alderson Reporting Company

You thought the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Respondents asked us to overrule Thermtron.

2

you say, "Respondents' implicit request for this Court

3

to overrule Thermtron should be rejected."

4

MR. RHODES:

On page 22,

Yes, we did say that, and I'm

5

not sure that they -- they expressly said you should

6

overrule Thermtron, but the strong suggestion in their

7

brief was perhaps you should.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, isn't it -- isn't it

9

also the case that Congress has amended the relevant

10

provisions of 1447 since Thermtron and they have not

11

seen fit to overrule or change those provisions?

12

MR. RHODES:

Given the fact that Congress

13

has twice amended 1447(c) after Thermtron, it seems that

14

they have actually ratified this Court's statutory

15

construction under Thermtron, and -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

of attention across the street?

18

remand orders gets -

So this gets a lot

The reviewability of

19

(Laughter.)

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, in one of

21

those provisions they said this was only technical

22

amendments, and if they're just doing technical

23

amendments that doesn't mean they have to look at it and

24

approve the whole thing.

25

MR. RHODES:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, if they
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

wanted to get rid of Thermtron they could have done it

2

in a very direct way.

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's right, but

what if we want to get rid of it?

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. RHODES:

I can't suggest what the Court

7

might finally decide other than to say that -- that,

8

again, the circuit courts of appeal have uniformly

9

applied this.

10

They seem to be -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they don't

11

have a choice, right?

They can't say, I don't like the

12

Supreme Court rule so I'm not going to apply it, other

13

than the Federal Circuit.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. RHODES:

16

that was going to be my next point.

17

Circuit -- but it does, again, provide a workable

18

framework for dealing with these issues, and it seems to

19

be a very large departure to go back and wipe out the

20

last 30 years of case law that has been developed to

21

handle these issues.

22
23
24
25

Actually, Mr. Chief Justice,
Not the Federal

It would be a large departure.

If there's no other questions, I'll reserve
the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me just make one

comment on the large departure:

Would it be a large

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

departure if we just said, in the very narrow category

2

of cases where there has been a remand on the basis of

3

-- the district judge doesn't want to exercise

4

supplementary jurisdiction over State law claims, that's

5

not appealable, period?

6

exception from Thermtron?

7

MR. RHODES:

Just say that's a slight

Well, Mr. Chief Justice -

8

sorry -- Justice Stevens, that would be an exception

9

under Thermtron that doesn't seem to be called for

10

because the way it's been interpreted, it has to be -

11

and the way even the amendments in '88 and again in '96

12

-- it's only barred if it's for a lack of subject matter

13

jurisdiction, and plainly here a discretionary remand -

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- not for that basis?

15

They're not amendments of subsection (d), and subsection

16

(d) is what has the language that really reads right on

17

this case.

18

MR. RHODES:

Well, I think the other -- the

19

other problem with that is the whole doctrine of -- of

20

supplemental jurisdiction that was first laid out in

21

Carnegie-Mellon and United Mine Workers, where the

22

difference between remands under 1367(c) seem not to

23

overlap with the remands under 1447(d) and 1441.

24

we made that an exception and we pulled this into

25

1447(d), it -- I'm not sure what the consequences would

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE S. ALLISON

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6
7

MR. ALLISON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8

Let me begin with Petitioner's counsel's

9

last remark, and that is that we don't know what the

10

consequences would be, except that we do know that by

11

applying the review bar to supplemental jurisdiction

12

remands, it would bring us closer to achieving the

13

purpose that has been expressed in the statutes of

14

Congress since 1887.

15

I know that the Court is familiar with the

16

late Chief Justice Rehnquist's dissenting opinion when

17

he was an Associate Justice in the Thermtron case and

18

Justice Rehnquist at that time wrote that there had been

19

no cases since the review bar was put into place in

20

1887, no cases where exceptions to review had been

21

recognized.

22

review.

He believed that it was a plenary bar on

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that was a dissenting

24

opinion, and that was how many years ago?

25

years?
20
Alderson Reporting Company

How many

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ALLISON:

Justice Ginsburg, it -- it was

2

a dissenting opinion, and it was in 1976, and we

3

certainly would not cite it as authoritative except for

4

our confidence in Justice Rehnquist's review of the law

5

as it existed at that time.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you have a majority

7

rationale that says, although 1447(d) reads in absolute

8

terms, in fact the only remands that it covers are those

9

based on a defect in the removal or lack of subject

10

matter jurisdiction.

11

had a result that we can limit to Thermtron's own

12

unusual facts because the court gave a rationale.

13

mean, courts give reasons for what they do.

14

court drastically limited 1447(d) when it said 1447(d)

15

has to be read consonant with 1447(c), and 1447(c) deals

16

with only two kinds of remands, one for defective

17

removal and the other for lack of subject matter

18

jurisdiction.

19

So you can't say, well, Thermtron

MR. ALLISON:

I

And the

That is correct, Justice

20

Ginsburg.

21

question, to Your Honor's earlier question, we are not

22

asking for Thermtron to be overruled, but I think, in

23

effect, to be updated.

24
25

And, in fact, to harken to your earlier

The Court in Thermtron did give a rationale,
and the rationale that it gave was that it viewed, the
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

opinion for the Court by Justice White viewed 1447(c) as

2

being the sole source of Federal remand power.

3

the Court noticed in the ensuing 30, 40 -- excuse me -

4

yes, 40-odd years, there have been a number of other

5

sources of remand power recognized.

And as

6

And we see no reason why the holding in

7

Thermtron should not be overruled but be updated to

8

recognize that the spirit of what the Court held in that

9

case would be served and would be harmonized with the

10

review bar as it has existed lo these 120 odd-years,

11

would be served by expanding the -- excuse me,

12

contracting the reach of Thermtron so that it is not

13

simply 1447(c) remands, but any remand authorized by

14

statute.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But no matter -- no

16

matter what adjective or what verb you use, that's

17

overruling a very clear rule of Thermtron.

18

normally operate on a theory that when a conventional

19

statute is construed by this Court, it stays construed

20

until Congress changes it.

21

And we

And I don't -- I don't see how you can

22

follow the line of reasoning that you're proposing, even

23

though you talk about updating and harmonizing, without

24

violating that basic stare decisis rule.

25

MR. ALLISON:

It's an essential question,
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Souter.

And I think the way we harmonize it is

2

to say that Thermtron has indeed been pared back by the

3

Court's subsequent decisions.

4

second argument that the Court do something with the

5

rule in Thermtron.

And, of course, it is our

6

Our primary argument gets to the question of

7

the statutory language and whether a Cohill remand falls

8

within it.

9

certainly, it's well recognized that Cohill disapproved

10

and pared down that portion of Thermtron that held that

11

the only remand power is the remand power expressed in

12

1447(c).

13

But our secondary argument is to say,

And a later case, in Quackenbush, the

14

question of whether mandamus or appeal was the

15

appropriate vehicle for challenging remand orders.

16

in that case, again, the Court said that we are

17

disavowing Thermtron's sweeping statement that mandamus

18

is the only vehicle for challenging a remand order.

19
20
21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And

We did -- we did not

disavow the relationship between (c) and (d).
MR. ALLISON:

Indeed, the Court did not.

22

And we suggest again only -- it is only a suggestion in

23

our brief that the Court might wish to look at the

24

ensuing history since Thermtron and make a similar

25

limiting statement that recognizes that a lot of remand
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority has been established since Thermtron, and a

2

number of statutes by the Court's -- by the Court's

3

holding in Cohill.

4
5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What in addition to the

civil rights provision?

6

MR. ALLISON:

Well, indeed in Things

7

Remembered, the Court was considering whether a 1447's,

8

comma -- whether 1447's review bar applied to a remand

9

under 1452.

1452 is another statute that deals with

10

remands in the context of cases associated with

11

bankruptcy issues.

12

for failing to follow a removal procedure, and the Court

13

held, citing Rice, United States versus Rice, based on

14

Congress's awareness of the universality of the review

15

ban.

16

provides for remand, for the review bar applies whether

17

or not, of course -

18
19
20

And in that case, there was a remand

That when another statute comes in place that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then that's a specific

statute that would prevail over the general provision.
MR. ALLISON:

It's a little bit -- Justice

21

Ginsburg, it's a little bit different than the Court's

22

decision in Osborn, in which the much more specific

23

Westfall Act Provision was held to prevail over 1447.

24
25

In Things Remembered, it was simply the fact
that the review bar was held to apply to a remand, even
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

according -- under another statute, and, of course,

2

recognizing that there are now other statutory bases for

3

remand.

4

Ginsburg, I believe you wrote the concurrence on this -

5

is that 1452 provides for remand on any equitable

6

ground, and that such remands are not subject to review

7

by appeal or otherwise.

The interesting thing about 1452 -- and Justice

8
9

So 1452, again, expresses, I think, a trend
in the thinking of Congress, if there is such a thing as

10

the thinking of Congress, that the review bar will be

11

expanded and will even include such discretionary

12

decisions by a district court as any equitable ground.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Things Remembered, I

14

think, was raised very carefully, such to say that the

15

question that's before the Court now has not been

16

decided before, the precise question here -

17

MR. ALLISON:

Yes.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. ALLISON:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- discretionary remand?

That is So -- and I think, I

21

looked again at Things Remembered, and it turned out to

22

be just as I remembered it -

23

(Laughter.)

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

colorless.

-- that it was neutral,

It just said we haven't been confronted with
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this issue.

2

although it said it in more definite terms, it is far

3

from clear.

4

And I think Powerex said the same thing,

MR. ALLISON:

That is true, and that is what

5

the federal circuit said -- meant when it said that

6

Powerex made the question precedential.

7

certainly, if Things Remembered had decided the issue

8

that's before the Court today, I think the issue

9

wouldn't be before the Court today.

10
11

Because,

And that is, of

course, why we're here.
But the Thermtron -- the Thermtron issue

12

really is our second argument, and the it is a very

13

gentle argument that the Court -- and if the Court

14

certainly wishes to continue discussing that, that is -

15

that is very profitable for what we're doing here today.

16

But the first argument is that, harkening

17

back to your original questions, Justice Ginsburg, why

18

shouldn't a remand when only state law claims remain in

19

a case, and -- Cohill 1367(c)3 why should that not come

20

within the language of 1447(c), what I'll call the

21

jurisdictional clause, because it clearly is a matter

22

that is only of concern to state courts -- and I think

23

that the Court in United Mine Workers v. Gibbs made

24

clear that when all State -- all the federal claims have

25

left the case and only State law claims remain, that
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's almost presumptive that those should be sent back.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but your opponent's

3

argument is that the claims that remain do include a

4

federal claim.

5

MR. ALLISON:

That is true, Justice Stevens.

6

That is his argument.

And I think what's important

7

about that argument is the inconsistency it sets up.

8

essentially casts a net that draws in these supplemental

9

jurisdiction cases.

It

And what the net does is it allows

10

the courts of appeals to review some artful pleading

11

issues, which is essentially what we have here.

12

state law claims, and our opponents are suggesting that

13

these are, in fact, disguised federal claims that must

14

be heard in federal -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

the RICO claim itself?

17

issue.

18

MR. ALLISON:

We have

What about the ruling on

That was clearly a federal

Yes.

The RICO claim was

19

what -- was what gave the district court jurisdiction

20

over the case in the first place.

21

that in the district court's decision, it made me

22

think -- it made me think a little bit of the Waco case,

23

because in the district court's decision, the district

24

court very clearly said, first, I have no jurisdiction

25

over these State law claims, and I'm going to remand

And it's interesting

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

them, and now I will turn to the RICO claim which

2

creates a conundrum that I'm not sure -

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Maybe the district judge

4

didn't say that.

5

where it did.

6

because there is -- that's what supplemental

7

jurisdiction is.

8

a huge difference between you have no jurisdiction, you

9

are powerless, and you have power, but it's up to you to

10
11

Maybe you can point me to the place

But if it did say it, it's flatly wrong,

It's says you have jurisdiction, it's

exercise it or not.
MR. ALLISON:

Justice Ginsburg, that's why

12

we didn't -- we didn't press that point because I think

13

-- I think that even we can see that the court exercised

14

its jurisdiction to decide and dismiss the RICO claim,

15

although it's reminiscent of -- of -- of the decision

16

in Kircher -

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

decision about RICO.

19

claims stated.

It wasn't a discretionary

RICO -- there was no Federal

That's out of it.

20

MR. ALLISON:

Right.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What the district court

22

has jurisdiction over are the supplemental claims, which

23

it can choose not to exercise, but it can say, "I don't

24

have jurisdiction," because Congress has given

25

supplemental jurisdiction, but then left it to the court
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

to remand on stated conditions.
But you -- you seem to conflate the absence

3

of subject matter jurisdiction with a discretionary

4

decision not to exercise subject matter jurisdiction

5

that the court undoubtedly has.

6

MR. ALLISON:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I have

7

made every effort not to conflate those two -- those two

8

concepts, and in fact we did say that when -- when a

9

court acquires supplemental jurisdiction in a case, that

10

that is a species of subject matter jurisdiction at that

11

point, as the Court held in City of Chicago v

12

International College of Surgeons.

13

At that point the court does have a

14

mandatory discretion -- or mandatory jurisdiction to

15

exercise power over the entire Article III case; but we

16

then argue when the Federal claims leave the case that

17

jurisdiction changes.

18

mandatory one that the court, as in Thermtron, would

19

certainly be concerned if the district court had -- if

20

jurisdiction that's mandatory.

21

operation of 1367 from mandatory to discretionary; and

22

when Congress passed 1367 in 1990, Congress intended to

23

codify the existing law right up through Cohill on the

24

subject of supplemental jurisdiction, combining

25

ancillary and intended in those -

That jurisdiction changes from a

But it changes by

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your idea is

2

there is jurisdiction, but when the Federal claims fall

3

out then there is no jurisdiction?

4

MR. ALLISON:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay, but that seems

6

to me to echo the fundamental misperception that if you

7

have Federal jurisdiction based on a particular event -

8

let's say if you're dumping chemicals in the water; that

9

gives you a Federal cause of action; you have Federal

10

jurisdiction, there's a trial; it turns out you weren't

11

dumping chemicals with it.

12

no jurisdiction; there was jurisdiction before, but once

13

the finding is made that the facts didn't support it,

14

then there was no jurisdiction."

15

jurisdiction all the time and you lose."

16

MR. ALLISON:

You don't then say "there is

You say, "there was

There was -- there was indeed

17

jurisdiction.

18

the change, when it goes from mandatory, the concern of

19

Thermtron, to discretionary, which gives -- virtually

20

pushes out of the Federal Court to the State courts

21

anytime up until trial -- the nature of that

22

jurisdiction changes; and we believe that that is not

23

what Congress intended by the words "subject matter

24

jurisdiction" in 1447(c).

25

And what we argue is that the nature of

So if we come back to the words of the
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute, the words of the statute should be construed

2

broadly in order to serve the purposes of -- of remand.

3

The Court has made clear that concerns of comity and

4

federalism say that we should construe 1447 in favor of

5

remand and I believe that that should extend to the

6

concept of the whole delay of concept and shuttling.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then -- when what you are

8

doing is that you are using the label "subject manager

9

jurisdiction" in a way that seems to me, that -- there

10

are many categories that -- could be ambiguous at the

11

edges, but not subject matter jurisdiction.

12

matter jurisdiction means court, you have no power,

13

period.

14

question, there's no other basis for the Federal Court

15

to exercise jurisdiction; and to say, "Well, we can

16

extend the label subject matter jurisdiction to include

17

a case where the district court chooses not to hear

18

several claims, even though it has jurisdiction over

19

them."

20

notion subject matter jurisdiction.

21

MR. ALLISON:

Subject

There's no diversity, there's no Federal

I think is a -- is a -- a misapplication of the

It is -- it is a difficult, a

22

difficult conundrum.

I think maybe all conundra are

23

difficult, but this one particularly.

24

Ginsburg, in the opinion that you wrote for the Court in

25

the RBOC case, you very clearly pointed out that the
31
Alderson Reporting Company

And, Justice

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

word "jurisdiction" is used in a variety of ways by

2

legal scholars -

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but not subject

4

matter jurisdiction.

5

jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction.

6

in -- what I did in -- Arbaugh was explain that all

7

kinds of things like time limits on when you can sue,

8

have been labeled jurisdictional and mandatory, when

9

they are not.

10

Jurisdiction -- personal
When I did

They are simply statutes of limitation.

MR. ALLISON:

That -- that is correct, but

11

that is -- that is the nature of the problem -- that is

12

the nature of the problems that this Court confronted in

13

Kircher and Powerex -- again this is by analogy only.

14

We are not concerned about labels like that, if the

15

district court believes that it was remanding the case

16

because it lacked jurisdiction.

17

But I'm coming back to subject matter

18

jurisdiction, and I have found no case in this Court

19

that has given a definition -- Chicago with its

20

mandatory language was the closest I was able to find.

21

The Koffski case out of the Seventh Circuit

22

is the one case I was able to find from a higher court

23

that said that supplemental jurisdiction is technically

24

a form of subject matter jurisdiction.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What we argue -

Why is it only technical?

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

It says court, you can exercise power.

2

jurisdiction is defined as the court has to hear a given

3

controversy, and under supplemental jurisdiction, there

4

is undoubted power in the district court to hear those

5

claims.

6

MR. ALLISON:

Subject matter

In a -- certainly I think in a

7

textbook sense, that is what subject matter -- when the

8

world is divided between subject matter and personal and

9

third, territorial, which I think is a relation -- has

10

relation to personal -- when the world is divided along

11

those lines, then subject matter takes on the broadest

12

possible meaning, but we have conflicting broad

13

policies.

14

of subject matter definition; on the other hand we have

15

a statute which should be construed to favor remand at

16

almost all lawful cost.

17

On the one hand, we have a broad definition

And -- and subject matter, if we step back

18

from our -- our dichotomy, personal and subject matter,

19

subject matter also means, as -- as Your Honor said at

20

the beginning of this argument, something that is -

21

that is a subject with which the Federal courts should

22

be concerned, and on which they should expend their

23

resources; and we now have the circuit courts hearing

24

appeals from decisions, discretionary decisions because

25

they are technically within the realm of subject matter
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdiction.

2

subject matter with which the Federal courts should

3

routinely be concerned, and that's why United Mine

4

Workers -- and Cohill echoed it -- says, these claims

5

should be sent back, and Cohill even -- both cases even

6

said that the propriety of remanding the claims should

7

be reviewed at every stage in the litigation.

8

that I think presents us a pretty strong policy by this

9

Court that remand is to be indulged at almost any lawful

10
11

But clearly, State law claims are not the

That -

cost.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You put it in terms in

12

your brief, if I understood your position correctly,

13

yes, there is subject matter jurisdiction over

14

supplemental claims, but once the district court chooses

15

not to exercise that jurisdiction, it -- and these were

16

the words you used -- it divests itself of jurisdiction.

17

MR. ALLISON:

Yes.

The -- the argument -

18

and I was attempting to make a technical argument in the

19

brief, and I think today I'm speaking in slightly more

20

global terms -- but the technical argument is that when

21

a district court makes a decision, in the words of

22

Gibbs, that it would be inappropriate to exercise

23

jurisdiction over those claims, then the claims are to

24

be remanded.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

What about if it changes its
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mind?

2

MR. ALLISON:

Justice Alito, the question of

3

whether a -- question of reviewability because the cases

4

that we found that -- that talked about reconsideration

5

talked about reconsideration only because there was the

6

potential for review of these orders.

7

I think the norm for a remanded case is that

8

the order of remand is entered, and the order of remand

9

is certified and mailed to the State court, and the

10

district court no longer has jurisdiction at that point.

11

Now, certainly it could reconsider as it's

12

engaged in its decision process.

13

forth and reconsider it before it signs the order.

14

that's no different than -- than many other cases in

15

which the court can make a discretionary decision that

16

it has no jurisdiction.

17

It could go back and

The only -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The discretionary

18

decision is that it chooses not to hear the case.

19

not that -- there is no discretion there.

20

nothing discretionary about saying we have no

21

jurisdiction.

22

no power.

23

other.

24

exercise it.

25

But

It's

There's

"We have no jurisdiction" means we have

So the -- the two are just at odds with each

No power, yes power, but we choose not to

MR. ALLISON:

And I think -- I think that
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the -- again, the purpose of the review bar as it's been

2

expressed for over a hundred years has been to trust

3

district judges to make these decisions and then get the

4

case where it needs to be to be resolved on its merits.

5

So to say that the court chooses not to hear the case,

6

it -- it suggests something a little bit less gray than

7

the decision that I believe the court would make when it

8

decides that it's inappropriate to hear the case, in the

9

words of Gibbs.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You -- you think that

11

choosing not to hear is distinguishable from a decision

12

that it is inappropriate to hear?

13

MR. ALLISON:

I -- I meant only to suggest

14

that it is not a -- it is not a choice.

15

a -- an ill-considered choice.

16

choice involved in the decision that it would be

17

inappropriate.

18

resist a rhetorical question, but then I don't see how

19

anyone could say when a court is faced with -- with only

20

State-law claims that it could either decide or not and

21

it decides it would be inappropriate to retain

22

jurisdiction over those claims, that somehow it should

23

retain jurisdiction over those claims.

24
25

It is a -- not

Certainly, there's a

But I don't see -- and I -- I wanted to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that would argue

for a highly deferential standard of review, respecting
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the district judge's determination that it's not what -

2

it hasn't invested any time in these questions, and it

3

shouldn't because they are purely state-law questions.

4

That's -- but that's something quite different from -

5

from a -- the -- the terminology that you used is

6

troublesome because a court doesn't have power to divest

7

itself of jurisdiction.

8
9

If Congress conferred jurisdiction, it has
it, and the Court can't divest itself of that.

It can,

10

if Congress permits it, decline to exercise

11

jurisdiction, but a court is not capable of divesting

12

itself of jurisdiction.

13

MR. ALLISON:

I believe -- well -- and -

14

and this is a mechanical argument, but I believe that

15

when the court makes the decision and then -- and then

16

anticipates the remand, that that is divesting itself of

17

jurisdiction.

18

poor -- a poor word choice.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And perhaps it was -- perhaps it was a

But even -- even on your

20

analysis it seems to me that the -- the cart is before

21

the horse, because it is -- it is not remanding because

22

it does not have jurisdiction.

23

that after it remands, it loses jurisdiction, and those

24

are two very distinct categories.

25

What you are saying is

The -- the premise for the declaration that
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it does not have jurisdiction is a premise that even on

2

your argument does not arise until a following

3

agreement.

4

to me, into the category of -- of remanding because at

5

the point of deciding to remand it has no jurisdiction.

6

That, in fact, is false.

7

MR. ALLISON:

So there's no way you can fit it, it seems

It is simply a question, I

8

think, of -- of the choice of the word "divest" and what

9

that means.

I would -- I would analogize in order to

10

perhaps make it seem more -- more accurate -- I would

11

analogize it to what a district court now can do under

12

section 1447(e) where it makes a decision in applying

13

the law and using its discretion to allow joinder of a

14

nondiverse party.

15

require the case to be remanded.

16

That would then destroy diversity and

And I would say in that case that the court

17

makes a decision that divests it of jurisdiction, and it

18

is very technical to say that -- - that, yes, it lacks

19

jurisdiction as soon as it enters the order admitting

20

that party to the case.

21

same order that remands the case to the State court.

22

But that may very well be the

But I -- I do -- I do see that there is

23

power.

And if the case is going to turn on power, as

24

the Court -- or some of the language in Powerex

25

suggested that it might, then I don't know that we -- I
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't know that we make much headway.

2

see 1447(c) lacks subject-matter jurisdiction as being

3

broad enough to comfortably take in the situation where

4

the State law claims not really within the subject

5

matter of the district court's power are determined

6

inappropriate for that court to hear and sent back.

7

But I -- I -- I

And it would bring us that much closer to

8

realizing the purpose of the review bar that has existed

9

since 1887, taking a category of cases out of the

10

jurisdiction of the circuit courts.

11

I -- I had wanted to offer the Court some

12

statistics, as maybe proof-of-law professors might,

13

about the number of cases that are heard on this type of

14

appeal.

15

footnotes 18 through 20 represent something close to the

16

universe of cases in which discretion was found to be

17

abused.

18

egregious as the legal errors that a district court

19

might commit in making erroneous judgments that it has

20

no jurisdiction which were nonetheless subjected to the

21

review bar in Kircher and Powerex.

I can say that the cases that we found in our

And that abuse of discretion is nowhere near as

22
23

If there are no further questions, I will
stop now.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. RHODES:

4

would like to bring up.

5

I just had a few quick points I

First, I would just like to reiterate that

6

when Congress enacted 1367, that gave it Article III

7

jurisdiction in those matters, just as 1331 and 1332 do.

8

I would also like to reiterate that -- that stare

9

decisis should be maintained over this statutory

10

interpretation because it has proved to be workable

11

rather than not workable.

12

Again, the circuit courts -- even though as

13

Mr. Chief Justice has iterated that they have to follow

14

this, they have found it to be a workable framework.

15

And, again, as the Court expressed in Powerex, they

16

agreed that in Quackenbush that Thermtron was not

17

altered.

18

this Court's interpretation in Thermtron, and it has

19

been applied in Quackenbush.

20

And Congress has -- has seemingly ratified

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose, though,

21

if it would be an abuse of discretion for the district

22

court to retain jurisdiction, then maybe there is -

23

there never was jurisdiction, right?

24

discretion to exercise or not.

25

don't have discretion to exercise, you know, because

You said they have

If it turns out they

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's a huge State claim and a tiny Federal claim, why

2

wouldn't that properly be regarded as an absence of

3

jurisdiction?

4

MR. RHODES:

My response to that, Mr. Chief

5

Justice, is that until a court decides that it was an

6

abuse of discretion, the district court had jurisdiction

7

under 1367(c) to either exercise that power or not

8

exercise that power.

9

And unless there's any further questions for

10

me, I ask that the brief -- this be remanded to the

11

Federal circuit to decide on the merits of the appeal.

12
