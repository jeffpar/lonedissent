ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

11

Congress has directed the Veterans Court to

12

take due account of the rule of prejudicial error in

13

reviewing administrative determinations of veterans

14

benefits.

15

in holding that the Veterans Court should presume the

16

existence of prejudice whenever it finds that the VA has

17

erred in providing notice to the claimant.

18

For four reasons, the court of appeals erred

First, section 7261, the Veterans Court

19

prejudicial errors statute, is in language that is

20

essentially identical to that of the APA's prejudicial

21

error provision.

22

language in 1988, it was understood to place upon the

23

party challenging an agency's action the burden of

24

showing that any error was prejudicial.

25

And when Congress adopted that

Second, a notice error of the kind at issue

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

here does not JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

it was understood so?

4

commentary on that?

5

Why do you say that?

That

Because of the Attorney General's

MR. MILLER:

The principal reason that it

6

was understood is because the uniform practice in the

7

courts of appeals as of 1988 was to place upon

8

challengers to agency action the burden of showing

9

prejudice from the error.

And the Congress was well

10

aware of that, and in particular the Senate Veterans

11

Affairs Committee was cited in the Ninth Circuit's

12

decision in Seine & Line Fishermen's Union.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You basically have

14

four cases in the courts of appeals to support that

15

proposition, right?

16

MR. MILLER:

Well, Your Honor, it's

17

considerably more than that.

18

could even suggest any support to the contrary rule are

19

in the very different context of notice and comment

20

rulemaking under section 553.

21

And the only cases that

And the reason that that's different is

22

really for two reasons.

That is that the -- the

23

interest that section 553 is intended to protect is not

24

the interest of any particular commenter or particular

25

outcome of the rulemaking.

It's the interest of the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

public in having the agency's decisionmaking fully

2

informed by all of the relevant comments.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but this is --

4

I mean, it's kind of the -- it's the first notice.

5

gets the ball rolling.

6

teams and you don't tell one of the teams when the game

7

starts and then you say, well, it doesn't matter because

8

they would have lost anyway, there is no prejudice.

9

MR. MILLER:

It

I think it's like, you know, two

The reason that in a great many

10

cases there is not going to be prejudicial error of the

11

kind at issue here is that the VA has an informal

12

non-adversarial system and many opportunities to correct

13

the effect of any official notice error.

That is

14

illustrated by the history of the cases.

To take the

15

Ms. Simmons's case, for example -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can we go back to the

17

question that was just posed?

18

every agency -- agencies come in many sizes and shapes,

19

but in all cases, the APA places the burden on the -- on

20

the petitioner.

21

across the board, no matter what agency we are talking

22

about, that's the rule.

23

MR. MILLER:

We have never held that

But this Court has never held that

That's correct.

This Court has

24

not held that.

But Congress was aware that the uniform

25

practice, certainly in agency adjudications in the
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

courts of appeals, was to place the burden on the

2

challenger, and Congress -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Was Congress aware of this

4

when the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, you

5

mean?

6

MR. MILLER:

No, the statute at issue here

7

is the Veterans Judicial Review Act of 1988.

8

relevant time we are looking at what the practice was is

9

as of 1988 when Congress incorporated the language from

10

the APA and placed it into section 7261.

11

1988, it was clear that the burden was on the

12

challengers.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the

And as of

Can I ask you to clarify

14

exactly what you mean by the "burden" of showing

15

prejudice?

16

-- to borrow the terminology that you would use in

17

formal litigation, and I understand this is not formal

18

litigation before an agency, but to borrow that

19

terminology, is it correct that the issue here doesn't

20

concern either the burden of production or the risk of

21

nonpersuasion before the administrative agency?

22

the regional office?

23

there is evidence that the veteran as opposed to the VA

24

has to produce, that doesn't change, and whatever the

25

standard is that has to be met to show an entitlement to

Is it correct that neither of the following

Before

In other words, if there's -- if

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

benefits, that doesn't change either, so that all that's

2

involved here is whether -- whatever showing needs to be

3

made is to be made on appeal or on remand?

4

MR. MILLER:

That's correct.

If we are

5

talking about what showing needs to be made on appeal.

6

And as this Court suggested in O'Neal, you know, the

7

burden language is perhaps more appropriate for the

8

context where there's people presenting competing

9

evidentiary submissions to a factfinder and that's not

10

what we have here.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's in O'Neal.

It says

12

that, but most of the court joined and the reason it

13

says it is it just confuses everybody, at least me, to

14

talk about "burden" in this context.

15

is right, it says what this is, is not involving a jury,

16

not involving -- it's just what Justice Alito says, and

17

following that, what you have, you say to the judge,

18

"Judge, your job is to decide this.

19

whether you think that the one side -- whether there is

20

error or whether the error is harmless or whether it

21

isn't.

22

I think if O'Neal

Decide.

Decide

Decide it."
Now, it could be in a rare instance the

23

judge just can't decide.

He's in grave doubt.

24

what we are talking about is what to do in that -- what

25

should be a very, very rare instance.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

And so

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, when I read this case, I thought the

2

Veterans Affairs is absolutely common sense on this.

It

3

says, well, when you really don't know what to do,

4

Judge, if the veteran got no notice at all, then

5

probably the error was harmful.

6

notice, and all that's at issue is who should produce

7

what or whether he thinks that he didn't know that he's

8

supposed to produce a lot of information, well, there,

9

it would be pretty rare that it was harmful.

But if he got the basic

So then

10

you'd better say to him, veteran, why did this hurt you?

11

That's all common sense, and it seemed to me

12

that that's what the Veterans Court was saying and then

13

the Federal Circuit unfortunately, like I might have

14

done, too, got it all mixed up with this burden of proof

15

language.

16

which I am talking about sensible, and if so, how do I

17

get there legally?

18

Now, you tell me, legally is that result

MR. MILLER:

Justice Breyer, the reason that

19

we have used the language of "burden" -

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not criticizing you for

21

that.

22

trying to figure out to get to what I see as common

23

sense legally.

24
25

I'm not -- it's not a criticism.

MR. MILLER:

I'm just really

The point that we are trying to

emphasize is that, in the ordinary course the Veterans
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court, like any court, is going to act on the basis of

2

arguments that are presented to it by the parties.

3

when you speak of the "burden," you mean the challenger

4

has the obligation, if it wants the Veterans Court to

5

find prejudice -- to articulate some theory of how there

6

was prejudice.

7

So

And that -

JUSTICE BREYER:

The theory is he didn't

8

know anything about this, got no notice whatsoever, so

9

he didn't know that he's supposed to produce more

10

information or he'll lose.

11

MR. MILLER:

That's the theory.

But in order to -- in order to

12

connect that error -- I mean, that's an identification

13

of an error under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act.

14

But if you connect error -

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if you connect it by

16

saying normally a veteran who isn't that knowledgeable

17

-- not everybody is a genius in law -- when he doesn't

18

get a notice that tells him you got to produce something

19

more or you lose, he might forget to produce something

20

more.

21

That's the theory.
MR. MILLER:

If he has something more.

And

22

what we are saying is that in order to get a remand, the

23

claimant, by the time they get to the Veterans Court,

24

has already identified the error, has made an argument

25

to explain to the court that there was in fact an error,
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

at that point they ought to explain how the error

2

affected them.

3

of evidence, they ought to tell the court, "Here's the

4

piece of evidence that I want to put in."

5

If it prevented them from put in a piece

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, usually, when

6

you have an appellate court, with a hard question, is

7

easily divided, the case is resolved on the basis of the

8

standard of review.

9

close case?

What is the presumption, if it's a

And why isn't that all sort of what we are

10

talking about here?

11

the panel says, well, this side has the burden of

12

persuasion, so we're going to come out the other way.

13

It's a close case, and the judge -

MR. MILLER:

Because I think in a case where

14

the -- like these, where plaintiff has not identified

15

anything that they would have done differently, it isn't

16

a close case with respect to the question.

17

Now, we have to be clear:

If a claimant can

18

articulate something they would have done differently,

19

we are not saying they have the obligation of showing

20

that the outcome definitely would have been different or

21

more likely than not, it would have been different.

22

would be sufficient to identify what they would have

23

done differently.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what if what

they would have done differently is get different

Alderson Reporting Company

It

2

doctor in the prior testing who prepared the diagnosis

3

look at something that they didn't have them look at

4

before?

5

documents that they know they can submit or could have

6

submitted.

7

knows.

8

if they had the doctor look at the issue that now turns

9

out to be critical, but if they had gotten the right

11

In other words, it's not simply the absence of

It's that type of question where nobody

I mean, you don't know what would have happened

notice they might have had time to do that.
MR. MILLER:

Well, depending on the state of

12

the record in a particular case, that might be

13

sufficient to show a reasonable probability that the

14

outcome would have been different.

15

cases it won't be, and I think Simmons's case is a good

16

example of that.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in a lot of

But if the government has

18

the obligation at the very first to tell the veteran

19

what the veteran must produce to substantiate the claim

20

and the government doesn't do that, why shouldn't it be

21

the responsibility of the government to say to the

22

court, "this is what, if we had done what we were

23

supposed to do, this is what we would have included in

24

our notice."

25

whether there's anything the veteran might have done.

And looking at that, the court can tell

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But why shouldn't the government at least have the

2

obligation to say what it would have done had it

3

complied with the statute, what it would have said

4

specifically in this case?

5

MR. MILLER:

Well, I mean, how does the

6

government comply, to take Simmons's case as an example,

7

when the VA sent her the notice letter, her claim was

8

for an increased rating.

9

had already been determined to be service-connected, but

She had a hearing loss that

10

was not sufficiently severe to be compensable, and she

11

said:

12

severely worse to be a compensable disability.

13

notice letter that was sent to her, which is on page 43

14

of the joint appendix, was incorrect and simply

15

described the general requirements for establishing a

16

service connection.

17

out an increased rating claim you have to show that your

18

hearing has become worse.

19

My hearing has gotten worse and it now is
The

It didn't specifically say to make

But as soon as she got a decision from the

20

regional office, which is the first decisionmaker in the

21

VA system, she was told that the reason her claim had

22

been denied was because her hearing loss was not

23

sufficiently severe.

24

application of the certain number of decibels in each

25

ear yields a certain disability rating, and the notice

And there's a mechanical

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that she got from the regional office explained all of

2

that and cited the regulation that we produced in the

3

tables.

4

So at that point she was aware of why her

5

claim had been denied and what was missing, namely,

6

evidence that her hearing had become worse.

7

been given at that point a series of hearing

8

examinations -- examinations for hearing by VA doctors

9

and the results of those were all reproduced in the

And she had

10

decision that she got.

11

found that the government had failed to carry its burden

12

of showing a lack of prejudice, because we couldn't show

13

as a matter of law that there was no way she could

14

obtain -

15

And yet, the Veterans Court

JUSTICE BREYER:

Which is fine.

If I get

16

that record and if it is the way you describe, I'm not

17

in grave doubt.

18

described it, she knew everything she was supposed to

19

know, so there's no harmful error, okay?

20

talking about cases where there is real doubt in the

21

judge's mind about whether this failure of the agency

22

did or did not hurt the woman or man.

23

doubt, we have the Veterans Court telling us the best

24

way to administer this stuff is when they get no notice

25

at all, and you are really in doubt, judge, you don't

No problem.

The record's the way you

13

We are only

Now, when in

Official - Subject to Final Review

know if it was harmful or not, here's what you do:

2

Assume it was harmful.

3

don't know.

4

MR. MILLER:

They're the ones who know.

I

With respect, Your Honor, I

5

don't think that's a fair description of the effect of

6

the rule adopted by the court below.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose then we look at our

8

rule, we read the first paragraph, what this court said,

9

and we all held it, and therefore, we say, those are the

10

cases we're talking about, where you are in doubt, and

11

when you are in doubt, go proceed as the Veterans Court

12

told you in terms of who has to show what.

13

MR. MILLER:

I think this case is a good

14

illustration about why that sort of grave doubt you are

15

describing doesn't arise in a case like this, where at

16

no state in the proceedings has the claimant offered

17

anything that they would have done any differently.

18

they can't say, you know, here's what would have

19

happened differently, than there really isn't any doubt

20

what will happen on the remand, because if on the remand

21

if they don't do anything different then the result is

22

not going to be any different.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If

Maybe I am not following

24

this as I should, but it seems to me you are suggesting

that there is no error.

MR. MILLER:
error.

No, certainly there was an

There was an error.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

MR. MILLER:

What was the error?

The error was that the initial

5

letter that was sent to her describing what the evidence

6

needed to -- that she needed to submit in order to

7

establish her claim, misidentified that evidence; that

8

it described the elements of general claim for service

9

connectiveness, didn't specifically explain what was

10

needed just an increased rating claim.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are you saying that error

12

was not prejudicial because the earlier information she

13

received gave her what she needed?

14

MR. MILLER:

The principal reason why that

15

error was not prejudicial is because the only way she

16

could have received benefits for an increased rating

17

claim was evidence that her hearing had become worse.

18

And she had a VA hearing test that said her hearing did

19

not meet the schedule A criteria for being compensable

20

damages.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why wasn't that statement

22

you just made sufficient to discharge the burden of

23

showing no prejudice?

24
25

MR. MILLER:
shouldn't, then.

The fact -- I -- we believe it

But under the rule as imposed by the
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

courts below, it clearly wasn't.

2

Under the decision of the Federal Circuit,

3

the VA has the burden of showing that there was no way

4

that benefits could have been awarded as a matter of

5

law.

6

proving negative by demonstrating the non-existence of

7

any evidence anywhere that might have been material to

8

the claim.

And that had been in effect prior to the VA

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You know -- it's

10

easy to look back and view this in the abstract legal

11

terms, but we are dealing with lay people who are trying

12

to get something from the government, which is always a

13

difficult thing.

14

have got to show that this was during the service, then

15

they get another notice or decision saying it wasn't

16

severe enough.

17

government made a mistake in dealing with this layperson

18

who is just trying to get benefits to which they are

19

entitled, to say that the government has to show that it

20

didn't make any difference, rather than requiring the

21

layperson to do that?

22

And you have one notice saying you

Why is it so difficult, when the

MR. MILLER:

Well, because there are two

23

responses.

The first is that it's important to keep in

24

mind the stage of the proceedings which this inquiry

25

involved.

The prejudicial inquiry is only at issue once
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the claimant has reached the Veterans Court, which is an

2

adversary proceeding in which claimants do have counsel,

3

and they identified an error and they have explained to

4

the court:

5

stage in which it would be incumbent upon them to

6

articulate how the error might have affected them.

7

Here's what the error was.

So that's the

The other point to be made is under the rule

8

of the court of appeals it's going to be very, very

9

difficult in many cases for the government to discharge

10

the burden of showing there is no evidence that could

11

have possibly been produced.

12

number of remands.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the result is a large

And as between the two

14

courts, the court of appeals, the Veterans Court and the

15

Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, do we owe

16

either of them, maybe not deference in the Chevron

17

sense, but some deference because of their expertise in

18

dealing with these claims, and if that is so then do we

19

owe more deference to the court of appeals or the

20

Veterans Court?

THE WITNESS:

I'm not aware that this Court

has ever JUSTICE KENNEDY:

law, so I take it it's de novo.
MR. MILLER:

It's certainly that.
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in the exercise of

2

that review, don't we have to give some weight to the

3

determination of the Court of Appeals for Veterans

4

Claims that sees these claims all the time?

5

thought that that's where you were going to start out

6

because you cited 7261, which says that the Court of

7

Appeals for the Federal Claims shall, what, give due

8

effect to -- take due account of the rule of prejudicial

9

error.

I actually

And I think you could get from that that they

10

have a certain amount of latitude in determining what

11

the best rule is.

12

tell us that?

13

But you're not going to -- you don't

MR. MILLER:

No, and I think that by

14

adopting language from the APA using the same language

15

that applies to all kinds of judicial review of agency

16

actions, Congress strongly suggested that it didn't want

17

a unique rule for judicial review of VA determinations.

18

And so I think there is no reason to defer to either the

19

Veterans Court or the Federal Circuit on this general

20

question of the standard of prejudicial review.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask a factual

22

question.

In the administrative

7

proceeding the restrictions on payment of counsel have

8

now been relaxed at the Court of Veterans Appeals stage.

9

So there generally -- there is not counsel at the

10

regional office, but once the case reaches the board

11

there can be counsel.

12
13
14
15
16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There can be counsel.

But

is it really typical?
MR. MILLER:

I don't know the statistics on

that, because JUSTICE STEVENS:

There would be a dramatic

17

change, because years ago I remember a case in which the

18

Court upheld a ten-dollar fee limit on the notion that

19

these people didn't need lawyers at all, which struck me

20

as a little strange.

21

MR. MILLER:

In any event, that is no longer

22

the case at the board level, and even those claimants

23

who do not have counsel, the great majority of them, I

think about three-quarters at the regional office level

So there is some

Mr. Miller, could you help

8

me out on how the system works in practice in a

9

different way?

One of your answers a few moments ago

10

was that when -- I think it was Ms. Simmons was told why

11

she lost, she in effect got as much notice as she would

12

have needed to have to in effect do better on a remand.

13

My first question is:

14

remand?

15

MR. MILLER:

Is there an automatic right to a

If you are talking about after

16

the initial decision from the regional office, there is

17

not an automatic right to a remand, but there is an

18

automatic right to a de novo review by a more senior

19

official at the regional office.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

You can present new evidence.

you can get a hearing before the board.

And then if you are still dissatisfied with

The board's

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

review is de novo.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But even on the -

3

on the functioning of the system as you have explained

4

it, at the -- at the very least the person says -- let's

5

assume Simmons says:

6

get the following piece of evidence, which I didn't

7

realize was my responsibility.

8
9
10
11

Oh, now I understand and I will

Even on that explanation, it means that the
claimant is going to have to go through another stage in
the administrative litigation process.
So I assume that ought to count as some sort

12

of prejudice, and I assume it's something that, as it

13

were, the burden of championing the VA ought to bear

14

rather than the claimant.

15

MR. MILLER:

Well, I guess to the extent

16

that the delay in adjudicating the claim is a kind of

17

prejudice, it's not a prejudice that would in any sense

18

be cured by a remand for further proceedings, which will

19

just result in further delay.

JUSTICE ALITO:

didn't mean to interrupt.
MR. MILLER:

except for the JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but you are going to

3

have to go through another stage of litigation.

One of

4

the functions of the burden rule, and it might be too

5

subtle a function to worry much about, but one of the

6

functions is to puts the party with the burden on -- on

7

notice that if you fail in your obligation, you're the

8

one who is going to have to pay, unless you can convince

9

everybody that there was in fact no harm done by this.

10

And this induces the party with the burden to do what

11

the primary obligation says the party ought to do.

12

And on your -- and on your analysis, since

13

the government would not have that obligation, the

14

government has less of an inducement to follow the

15

statutory obligation.

16

MR. MILLER:

But the government has a very

17

strong inducement to follow the statutory obligation.

18

Like every agency --

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it may have a strong

20

inducement, but I'm talking about a stronger one.

21

the government knows that it is going to bear the burden

22

of any doubt about the significance of its failure, to

23

some extent I suppose that is going to induce the

24

government to be on its toes.

25

MR. MILLER:

If

there is not much we can do about that.

Thank you, Mr.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE

7

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SIMMONS

8
9

MR. MEADE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

I would like to make three points.

First,

11

because notice is integral to the system that Congress

12

designed, the VA's failure to provide notice is likely

13

to prejudice the veteran.

14

Second, it would be difficult for the

15

veteran and comparatively easy for the government to

16

carry a burden.

17

because under the government's rule the veteran would

18

need to engage in a speculative exercise, identifying

19

what evidence would have been developed had the veteran

20

been notified and had he received the full assistance of

21

the agency.

22

It would be difficult for the veteran

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is it a speculative

23

enterprise?

If you are correct, and the proper

24

resolution in a case like this is a remand, let's say

25

all the way back to the regional office, and if before
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the regional office it's the veteran who will need to

2

come forward with some evidence supporting the claim,

3

why does it make sense to remand the case to the

4

regional office if there is no possibility that when the

5

case gets back there the veteran can come forward with

6

medical evidence that's needed?

7

MR. MEADE:

Two reasons, Justice Alito:

8

First, it's not clear even in the Veterans Court that

9

the veteran will have notice of what's required, a point

10

I would like to address.

11

But, second, if it's remanded, the process

12

will develop as it should have in the first place,

13

because under the statutory scheme there is both the VA

14

and the veteran, the informed veteran, who have joint

15

duties and together during an interactive process they

16

develop the evidence together.

17

interactive process, to answer to Justice Stevens's

18

question, the veteran is prohibited from hiring a

19

lawyer.

20

required, the veteran cannot participate in this

21

process.

22

would really work would be to give the veteran the

23

notice that he was entitled to in the first place and

24

then allow the process to unfold as it should have.

25

And during this

Without having the most basic notice of what's

situation -- and I think actually your co-Respondent's

2

case illustrates this better than yours.

situation where the record as it has developed contains

some evidence that supports the position in favor of

denial of benefits.

contrary to the veteran's position is much stronger and

9

denies the claim on that basis.

But you have a

I

12

it's still going to be up to the veteran to come forward

13

with medical evidence showing hearing loss or vision -

14

connecting the vision loss to something that happened in

15

the service, why does it make sense to send it back if

16

there's no possibility that the veteran is going to be

17

able to do that when the case gets back?

18

MR. MEADE:

Well, the answer is, first of

19

all, that we don't know how the process would unfold

20

once the veteran has notice.

21

in the record, we don't know what evidence would have

22

been developed had the veteran had proper notice.

23

In addition, veterans often are not -

Well, for a few reasons.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

right, at this next level?

7

MR. MEADE:

First of all, it's unclear

8

whether the veteran would even have notice even at that

9

point.

None of the other requirements that the agency's

10

is required to give are the same as the notice

11

requirement.

12

given the actual notice by the time it reaches the

13

Veterans Court, they can use that to rebut the

14

prejudice.

However, if in appropriate cases they have

that?

it makes sense to tell the government:

with this case, which as I said strikes me as a law

12

professor's case that shouldn't make any difference in

any real situation.

14

MR. MEADE:

The reason is that it's helpful

15

to have presumptions to deal with the typical case where

16

we have in our case a first element notice error.

17

question where the veteran does not even know what

18

evidence he needs to put forward, in that case it makes

sense because of the high likelihood of prejudice to

have a general rule that the burden should be on the

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. MEADE:

I don't think it would be.

2

That's why it makes sense to have a general presumption.

3

In cases where the government can either show that the

4

process worked as it should have or that the veteran

5

actually received notice during the process, it can

6

rebut that prejudice.

In fact, in 2008 alone, the government has

What's wrong with

Mr. Miller's response that at the very first level of

14

know precisely why your claim was denied?

15

MR. MEADE:

Well, again, there are various

16

levels of review.

veteran the notice that she is entitled to.

3

MR. MEADE:

The question of whether the

4

notice is okay or not, is a question for the Veterans

5

Court, a factual finding.

6

Generally, though, I would agree with you

7

that either no notice or incomplete notice are the same

8

and would trigger a first notice error.

9

cases, I suspect, where the notice was erroneous, but

There would be

10

only on a technical ground, that the Veterans Court

11

would not think of as being a first level notice error.

12

One final point I would like to make, Your

13

Honor, is that in passing the statute Congress made it

14

clear that it wanted to assist all veterans, including

15

those whose claims did not appear meritorious on their

16

face, and it did so by overruling the decision in Morton

17

v. West in the Veterans Court.

18

That case has said that a veteran needs to

19

meet a certain minimal threshold before receiving VA's

20

assistance, that first the veteran needs to show that

21

the claim is well grounded.

22

passing the statute and said:

23

all veterans, including those whose claims don't seem

24

meritorious on the face and including those who can't

make a threshold requirement.

23

notice.

24

MR. LIPPMAN:

Correct.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So Justice -- the

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

implication of Justice Breyer's question is that your

2

client would lose, because your client did get the first

3

level notice and you say that that's not good enough.

4

MR. LIPPMAN:

That's correct.

He did not

5

get the second or third level of notices; that is, what

6

the government said it will get and what he was required

7

to get.

8
9

This is the letter or part of the letter,
critical part of the letter he got.

It says:

"We are

10

making reasonable efforts to help you get private

11

records or evidence necessary to support your claim."

12

So he had every reason to assume that the -- that the VA

13

would get the evidence that was necessary.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why doesn't this make sense

15

in your case?

16

troubling to me about the Federal Circuit's decision,

17

but maybe I am missing the point.

18

I think this illustrates what is

Your client was denied benefits for failure

19

to show a causal connection, to show that his vision

20

loss is service-related.

21

private ophthalmologists or optometrists providing very

22

weak causes of -- evidence of causation.

23

was not inconceivable that this was the cause of it.

24

was examined by two VA doctors, who said it was more

25

likely that this was caused by post-service infection

He provided evidence from two

37
Alderson Reporting Company

One said it

1

rather than by an explosion while he was in the service.

2

Now if the case -- if the notice was

3

defective, why does it not make sense to say to your

4

client, show us that you can come up with some medical

5

evidence that shows that this is service-related,

6

something more than a doctor who says it's not

7

inconceivable?

8
9

Then it makes sense to remand it.

But if

you can't do it on appeal, what sense does it make to

10

remand it, where the same failure to provide evidence is

11

going to doom his claim?

12

MR. LIPPMAN:

13

Two answers to that, Your

Honor.

14

The first is, the government makes the

15

proposition that all we need to do is offer an

16

explanation.

17

appeal, and that is every bit as evidential as the

18

actual evidence itself.

19

a whole practice of proffers, it opens up a Pandora's

20

box.

21

exception for extra-record evidence, when the statutes

22

make it clear that the evidence or whatever you are

23

using has to be before the agency.

24
25

But in legal terms, that is a proffer on

Now, if we -- if we are to have

I mean, where -- where do you stop if you make an

thing to do?

Why is that such a tough

It sounds like it's sort of -- is there
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

some law out there that stops you from saying in the

2

brief in a paragraph that, we would just like you to

3

know, Judge, that we had some evidence here, or we have

4

some now that we want to present to them.

That's all.

5

And then if I see that, I would say, my

6

goodness -- and you describe it in three sentences.

7

what is -- the Constitution doesn't stop you from doing

8

that, does it?

9
10

Now

What stops you from doing that?

MR. LIPPMAN:

The statutes stop you from

doing that.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

They stop you, but the

do it.

But with all due respect, I

Between me and the Veterans

Court, as to who knows best how to work this system,

19

it's ten to one it's not me.

20

MR. LIPPMAN:

Okay.

Let's look at it this

21

way.

Let's take it outside the VCAA context.

A veteran

22

has a right to a hearing, an evidentiary hearing, upon

23

request.

24

whatever reason the VA doesn't schedule one.

25

that right even though he requests it.

Let's say he requests the hearing, and for

He loses

if there's no notice at all, no, you don't have to have

a proffer, because it's up to the agency to do just what

more technical things, which occur far more rarely, on

that one, you better tell the judge in the brief how it

10

makes a difference.

MR. LIPPMAN:

Why can't I get that

Well, I guess you would have

4

to reconcile the more specific statute that deals with

Your Honor, in a way, the

1

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

2

MR. MILLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

I would like to make just three points.

4

First, on the question of what is provided to the

5

claimant after the denial in the regional office.

6

Before they get to the Board of Veterans Appeals, the

7

regional office issued them a statement of the case, and

8

that's described at 38 C.F.R. 19.29, and that regulation

9

has fairly detailed requirements about what has to be in

10

there in terms of a description of the evidence, the

11

description of the applicable laws and regulations and

12

analysis of the board's conclusions, or the regional

13

office's conclusions and its application of the law to

14

the evidence.

15

The second point -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think it's

17

perfectly clear from that what gaps need to be filled

18

in?

19

MR. MILLER:

In many cases, it would be.

20

But perhaps there would be some where it wouldn't, and

21

of course in those cases if there can be some

22

articulation of why it wasn't then we would agree -

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24

claimant disentitled to have a lawyer?

25

MR. MILLER:

No.

At that point is the

Once they file the notice

48
Alderson Reporting Company

of disagreement in the regional office and receive the

2

statement of the case, they could then have a lawyer in

3

the board.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But at the point they get

5

the notice and they are trying to evaluate the

6

significance of the notice, they are not entitled to a

7

lawyer?

8
9

MR. MILLER:

If you are referring to the

statement of the case, by the time they receive the

proceedings where they could get a lawyer.

says, "I really don't know what they are talking about

likely to have legal advice.

17

But if the client simply reads it and

And what I'm getting at is that the person

18

at that stage, at the moment the notice arrives, is in a

19

position, I would think, of extreme relative

20

disadvantage.

MR. MILLER:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23
24
25

I think You can see where I am

going with the argument.
MR. MILLER:

Yes.

The important point is

that the only way the prejudicial error becomes an issue
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and really the paradigmatic case that we are talking

2

about is where the veteran does get counsel and has

3

reached the Veterans Court and has identified the error

4

in a way that's persuasive to the Veterans Court, but

5

nonetheless identifies no additional evidence that they

6

would have -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but it seems to me that

8

there are two points at which the veteran is at a

9

disadvantage.

And you are talking about the second of

10

the two.

11

the first of the two is the point at which the -- I

12

mean, following the hearing, the veteran gets the notice

13

and the veteran is not in a very sophisticated position

14

to evaluate what the veteran is being told.

15

I am talking about the first of the two.

MR. MILLER:

And

Yes, and a claimant who in the

16

Veterans Court can say, you know, "I didn't understand

17

and as a result I failed to present the -- because of

18

the defective notice and my lack of understanding of the

19

statement of the case, I didn't present this important
