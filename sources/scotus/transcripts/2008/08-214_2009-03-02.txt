CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 08-214, Atlantic Sounding v. Townsend.
Mr. McCreadie.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McCREADIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Mr. Townsend is a Jones Act seaman who seeks

11

punitive damages for the willful failure to pay

12

maintenance and cure.

13

Like the unseaworthiness claim in Miles, Mr.

14

Townsend's maintenance and cure claim is a general

15

maritime law cause of action.

16

recover punitive damages under his general maritime law

17

cause of action because those damages are unavailable

18

under the Jones Act FELA, and to a lesser extent DOHSA.

19

Mr. Townsend cannot

This Court's decision in Miles requires

20

uniformity between the damages that a seaman can recover

21

under general maritime law and the damages that a seaman

22

can recover under the guiding statutes.

23
24

Those guiding statutes again are the Jones
Act, the FELA, and the DOHSA.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. McCreadie, in this

2

case, why is it necessary to get into that, whether they

3

are punitive damages under FELA and the Jones Act?

4

we accept, as I think we must, Townsend's allegations to

5

be true, he has said that Atlantic, as a matter of

6

routine, puts in a boilerplate complaint for declaratory

7

relief, reciting all the reasons why somebody could not

8

get maintenance and cure, even though that is patently

9

false, the allegation for example that he deserted his

If

10

post.

11

he falsified his application for employment is false.

12

He said the allegation that

Accepting the -- that to be true at this

13

stage, isn't there some kind of punitive measure to be

14

taken against a litigant who abuses the court process in

15

that way?

16
17
18

MR. McCREADIE:

First, Justice Ginsburg,

those are just allegations.

There's no evidence -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but -- but now we're

19

at the pretrial stage, and we're supposed to assume the

20

truth of the allegations in Townsend's complaint.

21

assuming -- they may well turn out to be false; but at

22

the threshold under 12(b)6 we accept those allegations

23

as true and then determine whether a claim is stated.

24
25

MR. McCREADIE:

We're

Well, if -- if those

allegations are true, there's no distinction between the

willful wanton misconduct that traditionally has been

2

the subject of the dispute about maintenance and cure

3

and punitive damages as opposed to those allegations.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But let's take this out

5

of the maintenance and cure spot altogether.

6

generally, if a court determines that a litigant is

7

abusing the court's process by filing false pleadings,

8

is there a remedy; and if so, what is it?

MR. McCREADIE:

Litigation

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there

10

is a remedy.

13

in that case was entitled to attorneys' fees.

14

And that's what Vaughan v. Atkinson

In that case this Court looked at abuse of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that all that

15

was at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully

16

withheld maintenance and cure that was owing.

17

allegations made by Townsend go far beyond that they

18

just unreasonably denied him maintenance and cure.

19

suggest that this litigant, as a matter practice,

20

standard operating procedure, makes false claims before

21

a court.

22

board there a sanction, wholly apart from the particular

23

claim, for a litigant who abuses the court's processes?

24
25

The

I think there's a -- there's

a number of potential sanctions.

if someone does abuse the litigation process, that is

But up until Vaughan v. Atkinson, in the history of the

13

failure to pay maintenance and cure.

2

5

courts, there have been punitive damages awards in -- in

maintenance and cure cases.

7

MR. McCREADIE:

But there is

Justice Ginsburg, I made the

distinction between there's no case in the history of

punitive damages to a seaman, a Jones Act seaman, for

11

the failure to pay maintenance and cure.

12

The case that you refer to, the Amiable

13

Nancy, and other cases, they apply to general maritime

14

law with respect to collisions, now with respect to

15

pollution, and that's a broader context.

16

at the history of general maritime law, if we look at,

17

for example, Calhoun, there's the critical distinction

18

between non-seafarers and seafarers.

19

Latsis, there's the critical distinction between seaman

and longshoremen.

they can recover punitive damages.

And because it involves a Jones Act seaman, that's the

25

class of claimant that we're looking at.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

And when we

1

have a Jones Act seaman the primary statute that we look

2

at is the Jones Act.

3

incorporates FELA by reference.

4

points out, also has an impact on the -- on the case.

5

Of course, the Jones Act

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the DOHSA, as Miles

Did this Court ever hold

6

that under FELA or under the Jones Act there are no

7

punitive damages?

8

effect?

9

Do we have any holding to that

MR. McCREADIE:

No, there is no specific

10

holding, and I would point out that if there was, that

11

would answer our question today and we wouldn't be here.

12

But that we do have is Miles, which is very

13

clear and specific about what damages are available to a

14

seaman; and those damages are compensatory damages.

15

Miles is clear that the seaman can be compensated for

16

pecuniary loss, the seaman can be compensated for his

17

pre-death pain and suffering.

18

are not compensatory damages, because punitive damages

19

do not compensate for pecuniary loss, and because

20

punitive damages do not compensate for pre-death pain

21

and suffering, they are not available to a Jones Act

22

seaman.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

MR. McCREADIE:

Justice Kennedy, Miles was a

4

wrongful death action.

5

question, well, that is a wrongful death action, it is

6

very clear, should Miles apply in a personal injury

7

action, then we need to -- we -- first we know -- we

8

look at the cases that have addressed that point.

9

But when we look at Miles and we

And first off, Miles does not say that the

10

uniformity principle applies only to wrongful death

11

actions.

12

Secondly, Cortes, Supreme Court precedent,

13

tells us that the rules are the same for personal injury

14

and death actions for maintenance and cure under the

15

Jones Act.

16

In Cortes, the opposite argument was made:

17

That the maintenance and cure claim could proceed for

18

personal injury but not for a death action.

19

Respondent is making the argument -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Here, the

Excuse me, that the

21

maintenance and cure claim could proceed or that the

22

punitive damages claim could be made?

23

MR. McCREADIE:

You're absolutely correct.

24

Here they are making the argument that the punitive

25

damages claim could -- can proceed under the personal
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

injury side of the case but not the death side.

2

Cortes has already addressed that issue.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4
5

And

Mr. McCreadie, there's a

question about this case, a troublesome feature of it.
That is, you are saying because there are no

6

punitive damages available under FELA and under the

7

Jones Act, then there certainly should not be any under

8

maintenance and cure.

9

questions, whether there are punitive damages available

But if we have to answer those

10

under FELA and the Jones Act, in the context of a

11

maintenance and cure claim, then we're deciding a much

12

larger question than are punitive damages available for

13

willful refusal to pay maintenance and cure.

14

deciding a question under the Jones Act, a question

15

under the FELA, and there are a lot of people who would

16

be interested -- and the seamen are a sizable group that

17

the law cares about particularly.

18

larger interest, a larger interest in the answer in the

19

Jones Act context and FELA.

20

questions in a case that doesn't present any claim under

21

FELA or any claim under the Jones Act is troublesome.

22

MR. McCREADIE:

We're

But there would be a

And to decide those

I certainly agree with you,

23

Justice Ginsburg, that the answer to this case answers

24

the question of what damages are available under the

25

Jones Act and -- and FELA.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But, again, if you look at Miles, which

2

analyzing both FELA cases, Vreeland for example, and

3

Kraft, which is a railroad case, it -- it has already

4

specifically stated what compensatory -- that

5

compensatory damages alone are available under the death

6

side, admittedly, and that the compensation for a seaman

7

and, therefore, for a FELA employee is limited to

8

compensation for pecuniary loss and for pre-death pain

9

and suffering.

10

Also, if we look at another string of

11

Supreme Court precedent, it's not as clear as Miles, but

12

if we look at the other string, it -- this Court has

13

stated over and over that compensatory damages are what

14

is available under the Jones Act; compensatory damages

15

are available under the FELA; and compensatory damages

16

are available under DOHSA.

post-Miles case, and it's written and states the

18

principles very clearly:

19

permits, I should say, compensation only for pecuniary

losses.

case, and it says that the FELA permits compensation

22

only for pecuniary losses.

23

For example, Zicherman is a

And so, again, if we look at the history on

14

whether they agree with those policy determinations.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

brief -- and please correct me if it's a

17

misimpression -- you didn't dispute the fact that

18

punitive damages were available historically for the

19

shipowner's wrongful refusal to provide maintenance and

20

cure, or am I wrong about that?

21

MR. McCREADIE:

As I read your reply

I -- that must have been the

22

Respondent's brief, because our position is -- hopefully

23

was clearer than that, that punitive damages have never

24

been awarded in the history of the United States for the

25

willful failure to pay maintenance and cure until

Of course, in Miles -

10

again, we're coming back -- was wrongful death, not

11

maintenance and cure.

12

MR. McCREADIE:

Miles was a wrongful death

13

case that analyzed an unseaworthiness cause of action,

14

which is brought under general maritime law.

15

looking at maintenance and cure, which is a claim

16

9

that one of the anomalies that was -- that was cured by

Should we distinguish between a

And the

There's no logic for

We also need to remember

10

Moragne -- the first anomaly cured by Moragne was an

anomaly where the unseaworthiness action would exist in

12

State territorial waters but not in -- I'm sorry, it

13

would exist in State territorial waters, but not on the

14

15

you would have a discrepancy between personal injury and

16

death, and that's one of issues that they tried to -

17

tried to reconcile.

18

And that troubled the Moragne Court, that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

was on the high seas.

20

Moragne, there was DOHSA, but then it was when you

21

weren't on the high seas that was the gap.

22

the case?

23

They had DOHSA.

MR. McCREADIE:

At the time of

That's correct.

there was a difference of what right you had under -- in

described as one of the anomalies.

2

that if the person was injured, they could get an

3

and personal injury, it made no sense.

17

Because there was the gap, there was no Lord

Let me try to answer the question in a different

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I just -- and you can

18

go ahead and answer that question without my

19

interrupting.

20

briefs in this case is that punitive damages were

21

awarded in some maintenance and cure cases (a) as simply

22

part of the overall award -- they weren't separated out,

23

but it was part of the measure -- and (b) that some

24

American courts, American judges, including noted

25

admiralty judges, awarded in some cases punitive damages

But my assumption from reading the amicus

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in maintenance and cure before the modern cases Moragne

2

and so forth -- and Miles -- that you're talking about.

3

Is that incorrect?

4

MR. McCREADIE:

That is incorrect.

If you

5

read the cases cited, and they have their roots in some

6

law review articles that are critical of Miles, that

don't like the Miles decision, but if you read those

cases -

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. McCREADIE:

And I'm saying the cases

12

that are cited in those law review articles -- the

13

purpose of the articles is to criticize Miles.

cases do not stand for the proposition that they're

presented for in the law review article and they do not

like maintenance and cure in there.

MR. McCREADIE:

There -- there are some

14

pre-Jones Act cases, like the Amiable Nancy, that -

15

that talk about punitive damages; and there are some

16

cases where some seamen have not been treated very well.

17

But a specific look at the cases reveals that there is

18

no pre-Jones Act case awarding punitive damages -

It is a case that we have looked at, and it is -- and

2

again, it is a case that I can say that if you look at

3

all of them -- it is a very tedious process; there are a

4

lot of cases, and wading through each one, none of them

5

hold or award punitive damages for the failure to pay

6

maintenance and cure.

7

And -

JUSTICE BREYER:

The Troop gave them $4,000.

8

9

Gross neglect, mistreatment.

10
11

"It is useless to parade

more of the sickening details."
MR. McCREADIE:

And our position is that

12

even if there is -- and there is not; let me be clear -

13

but even if there was one rogue case, one individual

14

case, that does not create general maritime law.

15

Something more is needed.

16

this Court would create general maritime law.

17

For example, a decision from

The Wilburn Boat case is an insurance case.

18

There's an example where there are some cases on the

19

subject of marine insurance, but there's not enough for

20

the court to conclude that there is a general maritime

21

law on that subject.

22

And so returning again to this -- this

23

pocket of cases, they do not stand for the

24

proposition -- even if they did, if you'll notice, two

25

of them, it's the same district court judge who is
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

making the noise that he would have done this or he

2

might have done this.

3

one district court judge does not create general

4

maritime law by mentioning the possibility of punitive

5

damages in one case.

6

And -- and our position is that

We're much more comfortable relying on this

7

Court's precedents, the line of cases that builds from

8

Moragne to Higgingbotham and culminates in Miles, we're

9

much more comfortable looking at the history of the

10

damages awarded by this Court to seamen, where it uses

11

the term compensatory damages -- compensation for -

12

over and over and over without any mention whatsoever of

13

punitive damages.

14

The punitive damages problem did not crop up

15

until Vaughn, even though now everyone seems to agree

16

Vaughn did not hold that punitive damages were

17

available.

18

I would also just like to mention all the

19

circuit court cases addressing this issue hold that

20

Jones Act precludes punitive damages, and any circuit

21

court that has addressed this issue since Miles likewise

22

specifically holds punitive damages are not available

23

for the willful failure to pay maintenance and cure.

I'd like to reserve my remaining time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF G.J. ROD SULLIVAN, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4

6

MR. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
I would like to start by answering the

7

question that was raised by Justice Ginsburg.

This

8

Court does not need to reach the question of whether or

9

not punitive damages are available under the Jones Act

10

or under the FELA in order to decide this issue, because

11

maintenance and cure is different.

12

Jones Act by centuries, perhaps even a thousand years,

13

and it deals with a distinctly different problem.

It precedes the

14

Maintenance and cure deals with a situation

15

as what do we do with an injured seaman to get him back

16

to health and get him into the workforce?

17

has provided since Catherine of Aragon went to Greece in

18

the 1200s that the ship owner has a responsibility, in

19

its capacity as a ship owner, to provide that seaman

20

with medical care and to provide that seaman with a

21

living allowance so that he can get better and get back

22

into the work force.

23

And the law

Now in 1920, Senator Jones intended to make

24

the United States merchant marine the world's greatest

25

merchant marine.

He was dealing in a factual scenario
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where 12 years earlier, on April 12 of 1912, the Titanic

2

had sunk; 1,900 people had died.

3

Virtually every member of the Senate and

4

Congress knew somebody who was on the Titanic, and

5

during the intervening eight years, certain points of

6

law became obvious.

7

on the Titanic could not recover for anything other

8

except their lost baggage.

9

the fact that their loved ones had passed away because

10

First of all, the people who died

They could not recover for

there was no cause of action.

11

Secondly, because the Titanic hit an iceberg

12

and was not unseaworthy, there was no cause of action

13

for negligence.

14

these two anomalies in the law, and said what we are

15

going to do is we're going to create a new class of

16

beneficiaries, who are dependents of people who die at

17

sea, and we are going to give them the right to recover

18

pecuniary damages.

19

pecuniary damages are mentioned in the law.

20

said, and as to seamen, we're going to give them an

21

additional right, a cumulative right on top of

22

unseaworthiness, and that's going to be negligence.

23

So Senator Jones set around to correct

That's the only place where
And then it

It never sought out to touch maintenance and

24

cure.

Maintenance and cure has been something that's

25

been monitored by the courts ever since its inception,
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and it is a self-regulating system.

2

ship owners regularly provided their employees with

3

medical care without asking the question.

4

a close call, they provided the medical care without

5

running to the court.

6

Before Guevara,

If there was

They provided maintenance.

Then came Guevara, and Guevara decided for

the first there were no punitive damages, and now you

8

have a growing problem in this country.

9

11

You have a

care without resort to the courts.
Now our position here is that a seaman

12

should be not ever have to come before a court to seek

13

maintenance and cure, and the court should never, ever

14

have to award punitive damages.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

some incidents in which the employer in good faith

For you to tell me oh,

this will just never happen, I mean, that's not the way

the world works.

MR. SULLIVAN:

No.

And Judge, when a -

23

when an employer comes to the court in good faith and

says there's no entitlement to maintenance and cure, and

25

there -- the court finds that -- or the factfinder finds

in good faith, there's no basis for punitive damages.

2

Then you merely have a dispute.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the situation -

Well, of course there are

4

going to be disputes, and the question is whether or

5

not, just from the standpoint of filling professional

6

responsibility, in almost any maintenance and cure

7

action where the counsel for the plaintiff thinks

8

that -- for the seaman thinks that the employer has been

9

remiss, he doesn't add the punitive damages complaint if

10

we agree with your position, which changes completely

11

the settlement and the bargaining aspect.

MR. SULLIVAN:

Whatever the motivations are, it is a

large recoveries for pain and suffering?

13

evidence of this.

14

regularly do maritime personal injury work tell each

other -- we talk about the fact that you can't afford to

these are never recoverable as costs.

You have to

And then you are working on a contingent
hourly fee.

If you win your case and you prove that
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they were willful, wanton, and callous in -- in denying

2

maintenance and cure, then you might get a portion of

3

your attorneys' fees back.

4

Now, you may do that as a pro bono matter on

5

occasion.

6

attorneys will take these cases.

7

But you cannot rely upon the fact that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why -- why does

8

joining it to a Jones Act case help?

9

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, because when you join

10

it to a Jones Act case, you have the substantial

11

possibility of getting either a settlement or a verdict

12

at the end of the case which is going to compensate the

13

attorneys for taking on the maintenance and cure case as

14

a portion of it.

15

And so, consequently, if somebody has a

16

serious accident, it falls under the Jones Act and there

17

is a maintenance and cure count, the attorney will

18

handle all of those together and feel adequately

19

compensated.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the -- the point

21

you are making is that the recovery under the Jones Act

22

can be very large, and the attorney on a contingent

23

basis would get a piece of that.

24

MR. SULLIVAN:

Exactly, Your Honor.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because it would be

MR. SULLIVAN:

What is your best?
Yes.

I would say that the

11

best are the Rolf and the Margharita, which were denials

of outrageous conduct.

But to say that, Judge, is there

respond to that in a couple of ways.

Alderson Reporting Company

First of all,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

punitive damages were part of the common law until taken

2

away by Congress.

3

And -- and it could be asserted that

4

maintenance and cure punitive damages were not necessary

because the threat was enough to -- to require

shipowners to go ahead and provide this.

prior to Guevara.

didn't -- seamen didn't run to the courts every time

And I would

Shipowners did self-regulate.

They

10

they wanted maintenance and cure; whereas, today they

11

have to.

12

The leading scholar in this whole area is

13

Professor Robertson at the University of Texas who wrote

14

the AHA brief.

15

catalogs the cases where he suggests punitive damages or

16

exemplary damages were awarded for outrageous conduct

17

involving failure to provide medical care.

18

And his brief on pages 7 through 11

And I would suggest that those show that

punitive damages were unexceptional before Vaughan.

They were part of the common law.

didn't involve medical care.

6

of damages.

7

There are reasons why that there is

And that's because in 1920 when Congress created

There was no recovery at all.
And so, Congress preempted this field of

8

death.

And it said that death cases shall be decided

9

under the Death on the High Seas Act.

But Congress has

10

completely stayed away from the area of maintenance and

11

cure.

12

the Court has always been the one who has decided what's

13

appropriate.

14

It hasn't enacted administrative remedies because

And this Court, as a matter of its -- as

15

maintaining its court docket and maintaining these

16

remedies, has the right and I think the obligation to

17

say we're going to keep these cases out of court by

18

awarding punitive damages when somebody willfully denies

19

this right, when somebody willfully withholds medical

20

care.

21

And I think if you do that, you're going to

see these cases are going to disappear.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not sure as

4

sure -- I'm not sure I follow that.

5

where we allow punitive damages it hasn't resulted in

6

the cases going away.

7

that it has given rise to a variety of claims on both

8

sides.

9

In other areas

Quite the opposite.

MR. SULLIVAN:

It

It seems

This is a very narrow area of

10

law, Your Honor.

11

the seaman the medical care he needs to get the maximum

12

medical improvement?

13

We are talking about are you giving

And that's all it is.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but the normal

14

medical malpractice area has given rise to a lot of

15

punitive damage litigation.

16

anybody different.

17

MR. SULLIVAN:

I don't know why this would

I think this would be

18

different because all we're talking about is does the

19

seaman get the surgery he needs.

20

surgery he needs and he gets worse or continues to stay

21

ill or he continues to stay in pain, then the ship owner

22

should be punished.

23

If he doesn't get the

But -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It certainly makes these

24

maintenance and care cases a lot more attractive to the

25

plaintiffs' bar doesn't it?

I mean, one of your

38

complaints is there's just no money in it.

2

not for that much.

MR. SULLIVAN:
money.

The claim is

The goal here, Judge, is not

The goal here, I think -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course it shouldn't be

6

the goal.

7

whether granting punitive damages will increase or

8

decrease the number of lawsuits.

9
10
11
12
13

But we're inquiring into the question of

I -- I -- I would think it would be
astounding if it would decrease the number of lawsuits.
MR. SULLIVAN:

I think it would decrease the

incidence when medical care is denied.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There -- there wouldn't

14

be any maintenance and cure claim if the system worked

15

as it was intended; that is, that if you have a sailor

16

who is injured, the ship owner pays room and board and

17

medical expenses.

18

MR. SULLIVAN:

That's all it is, Your Honor.

19

Just say if the ship owner will treat the seaman fairly,

20

will follow the doctor's recommendations, get him to a

21

doctor, give him treatment so he gets better, there's --

22

I mean, you are saying there may be more claims for

23

punitive damages, but there will be more awards of

24

punitive damages because there won't be this willful and

25

wanton, callous disregard of the seaman's rights.
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And so, I would suggest that, in fact, in

2

this narrow area of the law, if you impose punitive

3

damages, actual punitive conduct, conduct that deserves

4

punishment will go down and it will go down rapidly.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I wish it were as clearcut

6

as that.

7

should have had this very expensive treatment?

8

ship owner's medical counsel said, no, this treatment is

9

not necessary.

10
11

I mean, what if the seaman says, you know, I
And the

Is that -- is that a punitive damages claim?
I bet it is.

12

MR. SULLIVAN:

I don't think so, Judge.

I

13

think those kind of cases should be weeded out on

14

summary judgment by the courts -- by the district court,

15

because we're only talking about the willful, wanton and

16

callous withholding.

He's going to say that was

He just didn't want to pay the

MR. SULLIVAN:

And the court is going to

22

have to -- the district courts are going to have to make

23

a judgment as to the bona fides of that case.

24

think that you are going to find that it is very rare

25

when somebody is going to act callously when the

potential on the other side is that they are going to be

2

awarded -- have punitive damages awarded against them.

3

And that, therefore, this is going to be a

4

corrective mechanism that's going to do away with the

5

problem we currently have now and make the plaintiffs

6

even better.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I mean, it -

8

whether it gives rise to more litigation or not, it is

9

still a significant and will give rise to greater costs

10

on the part of the shipper which will be passed on, as

11

is the case in a lot of areas where you have punitive

12

damages, it will be passed on to the consumer.

MR. SULLIVAN:

15

If the punitive damages are

But the hope, of course, is that CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, even if

16

they're not.

17

avoid punitive damages, the ship owner is going to make

18

sure that there -- that that more expensive test is

19

provided.

In other words, you were saying, look, to

of the seaman.

It's going to err on behalf

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That doesn't mean

there are no costs involved in ruling in your favor.
MR. SULLIVAN:

That's true, Judge.

But here

again, we're balancing the interest of somebody who is

injured and whose condition may become permanent and

2

incurable by virtue of not getting prompt care as

opposed to the limited costs to the ship owner of

best care is.

care that medical care can currently provide to get the

seaman to maximum cure.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15

MR. McCREADIE:

Justice Ginsburg, I wanted

16

to respond first to a question that you asked that I

17

think there may have been some confusion with respect to

18

the answer.

19

There is pain and suffering available in a

20

maintenance and cure claim if the failure to pay the

21

maintenance and cure causes injury, causes hurt.

22

what we understand from reading the Osceola and Iroquois

23

as interpreted by Cortes.

24
25

That's

So, I didn't want you to be left with the
impression that even if a maintenance and cure claim was
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

brought by itself, if there's some injury, some damage

2

beyond the failure to receive the maintenance and cure,

3

there is a cause of action that could lead to, I think

4

as you put it, the higher award and, hence, attorneys

5

--

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

of action?

8

cure act?

9

Is that a separate cause

Or is it just part of the maintenance and

MR. McCREADIE:

It's -- it's maintenance and

10

cure and it can be brought either under the maintenance

11

and cure with an injury or it can be brought under the

12

Jones Act.

13

just don't recover twice.

14

You can choose your cause of action.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You

Are you -- are you then

15

disputing what your colleague said about lawyers being

16

reluctant to take maintenance and cure claims that are

17

not tied with a Jones Act claim?

18

MR. McCREADIE:

Justice Ginsburg, we're

19

relying on Supreme Court precedent as opposed to

20

anecdotal information.

21

specifically, that's why I'm explaining that they do

22

have the right to bring a personal injury component to a

23

maintenance and cure claim.

24
25

But to answer your question

And the other point I wanted to make in the
Ninth and Fifth Circuits those are the circuits of

4

cases.

5

the country for seamen's cases.

6

filing as just maintenance and cure or combining with

7

the Jones Act, the ratio would probably be the same as

8

any other circuit.

Since 1995 there's no dearth of

Those remain two of the most active circuits in

There was also a question about the Vaughan

10

and -- and what the dissent knew or didn't know; and

11

reference to McCormick on damages.

12

is a small point but it is interesting to point out that

13

McCormick on damages, the same volume that the dissent

14

referred to, specifically states that punitive damages

15

are not available under FELA -- under the FELA.

16

course, the Jones Act incorporates FELA by reference.

17

I think, again, it

And, of

Really the Vaughan dissent did not have the

18

benefit of Miles when it reached its decision.

20

found punitive damages are not available.
