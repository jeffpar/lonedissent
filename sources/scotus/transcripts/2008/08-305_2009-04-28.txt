District v. T.A.

Mr. Feinerman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FEINERMAN:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

The 1997 amendments to IDEA prohibit tuition

12

reimbursement awards for students who are unilaterally

13

placed in private school without first having received

14

special education services from the public school

15

district.

16

This is so under ordinary principles of

17

statutory construction and particularly so under the

18

Spending Clause clear notice rule.

19

Prior to 1997, IDEA did not expressly

20

address tuition reimbursement for unilaterally placed

21

students.

22

1412(a)(10)(C).

23

that when the school district makes a free appropriate

24

public education available, a FAPE, no reimbursement is

25

allowed.

In 1997, Congress added section
In subsection (i), Congress provided

And then in subsections (ii) through (iv),
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress addressed situations where courts and hearing

2

officers may award tuition reimbursement and said that

3

reimbursement may be allowed where the school district

4

does not make a FAPE available to a student who

5

previously received special education services from the

6

public district.

7

Congress said nothing -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Feinerman, but the -

8

the first provision that you read, sub (i), says that

9

there will be no reimbursement if the agency has made a

10

free appropriate public education available to the child

11

and the parents elected to place the child in private

12

school.

13

appropriate public education -- and here, as I

14

understand it, the school district said that this child

15

was ineligible for special education.

16

MR. FEINERMAN:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that "if" -- if the agency made a free

That's correct.
So if the child was

18

entitled to a free appropriate public education and

19

didn't get it, then under this sub (i), wouldn't the

20

parents be entitled to tuition reimbursement?

21

MR. FEINERMAN:

No.

Subsection (i) covers

22

students who are provided a free appropriate public

23

education.

24

other category of students -

25

Subsections (ii) through (iv) address the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that's your -

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FEINERMAN:

-- those who are not -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's your construction.

3

But couldn't this be read to say no reimbursement if -

4

the word is "if" -- the agency, not -- so the

5

implication is if the agency did not make a free

6

appropriate public education available, then -

7

MR. FEINERMAN:

That -- that might be the

8

implication if there weren't subsection (C)(ii) through

9

(C)(iv).

So it's -- it's T.A.'s argument and the

10

government's argument that (C)(i) sets forth the general

11

rule, but if that were the way that -- that Congress

12

meant the statute to operate, it wouldn't have had any

13

reason to put in (C)(ii) through (C)(iv) because we

14

would already know from (C)(i) that tuition

15

reimbursement was a possibility for students who did not

16

receive -- previously receive special education services

17

from the public district.

18

Congress instead went on in (C)(ii) through

19

(C)(iv) to address very specifically, in the context of

20

a comprehensive statutory scheme, when tuition

21

reimbursement would be available to students who did not

22

previously receive.

23

essentially being invited to do so in Burlington, which

24

of those students could get tuition reimbursement.

25

And Congress specified, after

Of course, (ii) through

3

requirement of (i).

4

MR. FEINERMAN:

Oh, no.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It -

(i) is only at most a

6

negative implication, which -- which one would not draw

7

in light of (ii) through (iv), is what you're saying.

And -- and they deal with different sets of

students.

available; in (ii) through (iv), the school district has

12

not made a FAPE available.

13

when a FAPE is not made available to a student who had

14

not previously received.

15

In (i), the school district has made a FAPE

And no mention is made of

And under this Court's decision in

16

Arlington, because those students like T.A. who had not

17

previously received, are not mentioned, yet Congress -

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then -- then what happens

19

in a case which I think is like this one, where the

20

child doesn't receive special education because the

21

school has determined that the child is not eligible?

22

So the child isn't getting public education, and in the

23

parents' view, confirmed by experts, the child is in

24

need of special education, can't get it from the public

25

schools, because they declared the child ineligible.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

What is such a parent to do?

2

MR. FEINERMAN:

If -- if it's an incorrect

3

determination by the school district, the problem is

4

remedied rather quickly.

frames in IDEA -

6

There are very tight time

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, the parents here

7

didn't -- didn't run off to a private school only after

8

the school district had found that their child didn't

9

require any special education, did they?

10

MR. FEINERMAN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

They -- they put him in a

private school without even consulting the schools.

13
14

That's correct.

MR. FEINERMAN:

Right.

And then only after

the fact went to the school district and asked for -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Saying by the way, we can

16

get some money.

19

How much -- how much money are you

MR. FEINERMAN:

Well, it's -- the tuition is

$5,200 a month.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. FEINERMAN:

Yes, and then there's a

22

$5,200 alumni services fee, a $1,500 interview fee.

But

Mr. Feinerman, can we go
I've just got a question

1

of fact.

I should know this, but I don't.

You said

2

that if the -- if the parents and the school district

3

disagree, it can be remedied fairly quickly because

4

there's a fairly tight schedule set for the

5

administrative procedure.

6

question is this:

7

been exhausted, if there is still disagreement, is there

8

any limit on the time in which the -- the judicial

9

appeal has to be resolved?

10

MR. FEINERMAN:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What I don't remember, and my

When the administrative steps have

No, there isn't.

So -

Isn't that the -- isn't

12

that the kicker here?

13

understand your -- your textual argument.

14

see its soundness as a possibility that is open to us

15

and, perhaps on the face of it, the most likely

16

possibility, but there is a cost, and the cost, it seems

17

to me, is that once you get into the -- once you get

18

into appeals, this thing can go on for years, and you

19

can't wait years when -- when a kid is in this kind of

20

condition.

21

In other words, I -- I fully

MR. FEINERMAN:

I -- I can

That's correct, but there's

22

no need to wait years.

23

actually went through the process appropriately, unlike

24

T.A.'s parents -

MR. FEINERMAN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

education, isn't that so?

The school at an

That's correct.

That was in

2001, and the district judge, at -

10

MR. FEINERMAN:

Yes.

-- at page 39 of the

11

petition to the -- of the appendix to the petition, page

12

39 note 3, the district judge noted that the 2001

13

evaluation is an appropriate part of this case.

14

this -- for the parents who try and get their student -

"No.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When the school said not

2

eligible, is there -- is that question resolved first

3

before we ever get to the IEP?

4

MR. FEINERMAN:

I think, in a situation

5

where the school district finds the child ineligible and

6

there is an appeal, both the eligibility and the

7

appropriate placement are decided in front of the

8

hearing officer.

And then after that, it's

Well, wouldn't the school

say, we -- we have no obligation to get up an IEP until

14

the question of eligibility is determined?

MR. FEINERMAN:

I suppose if the school

district were to get a stay of the hearing officer's

17

decision pending appeal to the district court.

that's not what happened here.

MR. FEINERMAN:

It turns into a matter of

11

years, but in the interim this school district, Forest

12

Grove School District, while it was litigating in the

13

district court, Forest Grove School District offered an

14

IEP, and at that point T.A.'s parents could have tried

15

the IEP out, sent the child to receive services in the

16

public school district -

17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The IEP -- they did the

IEP after the hearing officer was finished?

19

MR. FEINERMAN:

Yes.

Less than 4 weeks

20

after the hearing officer was finished, Forest Grove

21

offered an IEP, and that's in the addendum to our reply

22

brief.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But I think we've

24

got to assume that Congress has some concern for the

25

parents who correctly say, this IEP is no good, it just
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can't be done in the school system, and the kid needs a

2

special school.

3

be that's the exceptional case and it shouldn't drive

4

the -- the inferences to be drawn about congressional

5

intent.

6

parents are at good faith loggerheads it can go on for a

7

long, long time, can't it?

8

MR. FEINERMAN:

9
10

In that case, maybe -- your answer may

It can go on for a long,

long time if the parents file for a due process hearing,
and that it can -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but they get the due

12

process hearing.

13

proposes an IEP; the parents, based on what their

14

experts tell them, say that isn't going to work, and the

15

parents say the only way we can educate this kid without

16

his falling behind more is to put him in a private

17

school.

18

it seems to me you get into court and it can go on for a

19

long time, if we accept your -- your analysis of the

20

text.

21

The ultimate result is that the school

At that point, with assuming good faith here,

MR. FEINERMAN:

But all the parents have to

22

do in that situation is to give the IEP a try and send

23

their child to public school.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but doesn't that get

to the point of something pretty formalistic?
12
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

somebody in the brief said, given one day under the IEP

2

and the -- if you win, ultimately the check can be

3

written.

4

That can't be right.
MR. FEINERMAN:

I don't think one day could

5

be right.

6

"who previously received special" -- "special education

7

service under the authority of a public agency."

8

doesn't say how long it has to be.

9

The statute says -- it -- it expressly says

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

It

Maybe -- I'm sorry.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I remember, perhaps

11

incorrectly, from the prior argument here that the

12

period that they had to try out the school plan was ten

13

days?

14

MR. FEINERMAN:

That -- that's a

15

discretionary factor that courts and hearing officers

16

can -- it's not a hard and fast rule.

18
19

21
22
23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not a hard and fast

rule.
MR. FEINERMAN:

But I think it's probably

good as a general benchmark.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is that -- is

that a period that your client's prepared to accept?
MR. FEINERMAN:

Yes, so long as -- in the

24

ordinary case, ten days would -- it's in the statute, so

25

we have that textual indication.

And it will provide

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the school district a chance to provide services under

2

the IEP.

3

And as this Court mentioned in a prior case,

4

IEP's -- it's not an exact science and when you look at

5

it on a piece of paper it's hard to know whether it's

6

going to work or not.

7

works is where the rubber hits the road and it could be

8

that the parents look at IEP and say, you know what, I

9

don't think this is going to work.

The way you find out whether it

But until you

10

actually give it a chance to work -- maybe the child

11

goes in and -- and works with the special education

12

teacher or the instructional assistant and they really

13

hit it off.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that's

15

realistic?

16

this is an inappropriate IEP and they send the child to

17

school for ten days under the IEP, at the end of the ten

18

days they are going to say, oh, well, we've completely

19

changed our mind, now we think this is a good plan?

20

If the parents are convinced going in that

MR. FEINERMAN:

It's certainly plausible

21

under certain circumstances.

22

every time.

23

It -- it may not happen

And it may not happen half the time.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't it also plausible

24

that the district will say, ten days is not a fair trial

25

for this system, this is a child with severe learning
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disabilities and to give this IEP a fair chance we need

2

ten months?

3

MR. FEINERMAN:

At that point those

4

arguments can be made under (C)(iii) and (C)(iv) because

5

at that point the child would no -- the parents would no

6

longer be categorically barred from seeking tuition

7

reimbursement and those are arguments that you can make

8

to the hearing officer.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you are basically

10

saying that the -- that the only necessary delay in

11

order to satisfy a condition for eligibility, if the

12

parents otherwise prevail, is a ten-day delay.

13

basically your answer?

That's

I'm saying -

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This school does not have

18

to come up with an IEP.

19

we're going to rest on our belief that this child does

20

not need any special education, right?

21

school proposes an IEP, the parent cannot come within

22

subsection (2) by sending the kid to get the special

23

services.

24
25

It could tough it out and say,

MR. FEINERMAN:

And unless the

I think that assumes that

the school district is not going to abide by the order

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in this -- in

What about before?

The

4

whole point is that under the words of the statute as

5

you interpret it, there is a condition predicate that

6

has to be satisfied.

7

saying, well, that assumes they won't obey the hearing

8

officer, what about before the hearing even takes place?

9

So, to say that -- to answer by

MR. FEINERMAN:

Right.

Before the hearing

10

takes place, there is 45 days, and then well, the

11

hearing -- there's a request for a due process hearing,

12

the hearing officer has 45 days, and then if the hearing

13

officer says this child is eligible, district, you must

14

propose an IEP, the district has 30 days after that.

15
16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what happens in the

case where -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could the district appeal?

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Doesn't your

interpretation of the statute create an incentive for

5

the school board to just say, we'll never provide any

6

kind of education, special education, we will just tough

7

it out?

8

if they do that, if I understand you correctly.

9

Because they can't lose, they can't be liable

MR. FEINERMAN:

I -- I suppose

10

hypothetically it does, but my understanding is that

11

that just doesn't happen.

12

other cases, the assumption -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would you be surprised to

find a court decision which says that when the reason

that the plaintiff cannot comply with the requirement

that he first be in a plan, when the reason is -- is the

17

district's refusal to abide by an order to prepare a

3

but not under -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you -- you don't think

5

-- you don't think a court could say the only reason

6

these people could not comply with (ii) is that the

7

school district made it impossible by not complying with

8

the order to provide an IEP; and, therefore, they -

9

they can recover for the private placement?

10

MR. FEINERMAN:

that.

15

It's conceivable that A court could also I think it's more than

I know a lot of courts that would hold

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But your position is that

16

there are basically two situations:

One, the situation

17

in which there is an administrative order to do an IEP

18

and the school district says, no, we won't do it.

19

Millions for defense; we are going right into appeal,

20

and we are not going to prepare the IEP.

21

situation, as I understand it, you are saying, the

22

parents have no way of getting relief under the statute.

In that

23

In the case in which there is an order for

24

the IEP and the school district prepares the IEP, even

25

though the parents think it will be inadequate, there in
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fact is a ready remedy subject to two delays:

2

time to prepare the IEP; and, two, ten days to give it a

3

try before the parents take the kid out of school.

4

That's basically the scheme that you are proposing that

5

the statute provides; is -- is that correct?

6

MR. FEINERMAN:

One, the

That's the scheme that

7

Congress wrote in the statute, yes, under -- under

8

(C)(ii).

9

to come back to a -- to a point that was aired in the

10

briefs, which is T.A.'s argument and the government's

11

argument rests upon the notion that section

12

1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) gives hearing officers the authority

13

to award tuition reimbursement.

14

give hearing officers any authority to do anything, let

15

alone to award tuition reimbursement.

16

And it has to work that way, because -- I want

That provision doesn't

The only provision in IDEA that gives

17

hearing officers the authority to award tuition

18

reimbursement is 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).

19

doesn't work -- the statute doesn't work, and the

20

Secretary's interpretation of 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) is

21

implausible because it accords to hearing officers the

22

authority that it doesn't have.

23

So if the statute

There is another textual clue why the

24

statute works in the way that I am suggesting, and that

25

is in the '97 amendments in subsections (iii) and (iv)
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Congress gave very explicit guidance to courts and

hearing officers as to the factors the court and hearing

officer should consider when deciding whether to award

tuition reimbursement to a student who previously

received special education services.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The -- the problem that

7

the government and the parents have is they have to give

8

some work to (ii).

9

doesn't seem to do much work.

10

Under -- under their view (ii)

And the problem with your position is that

11

it seems in a way formalistic and in some cases to

12

encourage intransigence.

13

that the school district's diagnosis was correct and a

14

presumption that it's -- if -- if there was a diagnosis

15

of disability, that its individual education program was

16

adequate, that would, it seems to me, not be all you

17

wanted, but would ameliorate the position of the school

18

district.

19

adopt such a presumption?

20

If we adopted a presumption

Would we have authority, do you think, to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, the hearing officer.

The hearing officer is the first-level decisionmaker.

23

And the school board gives its reasons why it thinks the

That's the threshold determination.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14
15

MR. SALMONS:

Thank you, counsel.

That you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

16

The school district in this case improperly

17

denied T.A., a child with a disability who had always

18

been enrolled in public schools, access to all public

19

special education services.

20

wrong eligibility determinations prevented T.A. from

21

receiving special education services, it is immune from

22

reimbursing T.A.'s parents the cost of obtaining those

23

services from another source.

24
25

It asserts that because its

ten days?

What is wrong with

I mean it's -- it's a big expense you are
25
Alderson Reporting Company

1

asking the school district to incur, that will take away

2

funds from other programs.

3

saying is give it a try for ten days, and if it doesn't

4

work out, then you can go?

5

MR. SALMONS:

And all -- all they are

I think there are several

6

problems with that reading of the statute, Your Honor.

7

First of all, the ten-day period that is referenced in

8

subsection (C)(iii) refers to the amount of notice that

9

a district needs to receive before a child is removed

10
11

from the public school system.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, yes, the first

12

day -- the first day they say, look, we don't think this

13

is going to work out, so we are notifying you what we

14

are going to do.

15

that in ten days, and they said, okay, ten days.

16

And they say, well, you've got to do

MR. SALMONS:

But that's -- that's simply

17

not the way these things work as a general matter, and

18

let me just point out a few things about the normal

19

process of developing IEP's.

20

never even got that far.

21

developed at the end of the -- of a school year for the

22

following year.

23

period of time in which to decide to go along with that

24

plan or to give notice and then make alternative

25

arrangements.

And, again, here the child

But, typically, IEP's are

And the parents at that point have a

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And it's simply the -- I mean -- and that's

2

the way it works, because it's important for parents to

3

be able to get their child in an alternative program if

4

they decide that's what they want to do.

5

wait until the school year has already started, those

6

may not be available.

7

requirement -

8
9

And if you

And the ten-day notice

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I suppose

that's right, but once the law is clarified, schools

10

that specialize in -- in treating these kids would be

11

able -- they would understand as well, and they would

12

understand you've got to -- the people who are going to

13

be sending -- most of the people who will be sending

14

their children to the school have to wait ten days.

15

it seems to me that the actual practice on the ground

16

would work out pretty easily.

17

MR. SALMONS:

And

But, again, Your Honor, if you

18

focus on the terms of the statute, the -- even under

19

Petitioner's reading, the requirement would be to have

20

previously received special education services, not to

21

have tried out a particular plan.

22

It may be the case that the plan for the

23

upcoming year is -- is very different than the plan for

24

the prior year.

25

assessment, and they had substantially changed -

Perhaps they have had another

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
that cut?

Well, which way does

It seems to me that cuts the other way.

3

MR. SALMONS:

Well, I -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

new plan.

6

give it ten days -- two school week tries.

7

We've worked on it.

Here's a -- here's a

MR. SALMONS:

Here it is.

At least

I think the way that cuts,

8

Your Honor, is -- is that that reading of what you are

9

positing, I guess, in this exchange what Congress might

10

have had in mind, is not what they said in the statute.

11

They did not require parents to try out a particular

12

plan; just that at some point in time they had

13

previously received special education services.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

With respect,

15

counsel, what Congress provided is that the child must

16

have previously received special education and related

17

services.

18

MR. SALMONS:

That's right.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I think they did

20

provide that you've got to try it out at least for a

21

minimal period.

22

MR. SALMONS:

But not the particular plan

23

that is the subject of the IEP, Your Honor.

24

that connection does not exist in the statute.

25

and we think it's counter to what Congress intended.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

That And -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So what type

2

of special education services do you think do count as

3

having been previously received?

4

MR. SALMONS:

Well -- well, if I -- if I

5

may, the way we read this provision, and it's set forth

6

on pages 3 and 4 on the addendum to the blue brief, and

7

we think it's important that we read this as a whole and

8

in context, is that subsection (C)(i) provides the

9

general rule to govern the payment of private school

10

tuition based on a unilateral placement by the parents.

11

And subsection (C)(i) creates the only expressed

12

limitation on the right to reimbursement, and it does so

13

only in instances where the school district has provided

14

a free and appropriate public education.

15

We think subsection (C)(ii), (C)(iii), and

16

(C)(iv) work together to govern the subset of cases that

17

is Congress was most concerned about and that, in fact,

18

are the most common scenario in which these disputes

19

have arised.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Except that you are reading

21

(C)(i) to say something that it doesn't say.

22

says you don't have to pay if the agency has made a free

23

appropriate public education available.

24

MR. SALMONS:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It just

That is what And you read it to say you

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

must pay whenever it hasn't made, and it just doesn't

2

say that.

It -- it's a safe harbor for the school

3

district.

It says, so long as you've made an

4

appropriate public education available, you can't be

5

liable for any -- any private school tuition.

6

Now, you want to expand that to say, and

7

whenever that condition doesn't exist, you are liable.

8

But it really doesn't say that.

9

sections suggest that it meant not to say that.

10

MR. SALMONS:

And -- and the later

Well, that's where we part

11

company, Your Honor, because, in fact, that negative

12

inference that you refer to is precisely what

13

Petitioners attempt to read into subsection (C)(ii).

14

There is nothing in subsection (C)(ii) that provides any

15

restriction on the ability to obtain reimbursement.

16

was written in permissive language.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It

In reading -- in

18

reading it that way, you are reading the phrase "who

19

previously received special education services" to mean

20

also who previously did not receive special education

21

services.

22

MR. SALMONS:

No, Your Honor.

We are simply

23

not reading that language "who previously received" to

24

be a condition precedent.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Yeah, so it doesn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

matter whether they previously received or not.

2

MR. SALMONS:

It does matter, Your Honor,

3

because the provisions that follow in (C)(iii) and

4

(C)(iv) that guide the exercise of discretion, in that

5

category of cases that were of concern to Congress, only

6

apply to the cases that are defined in subsection

7

(C)(ii).

8

received" still serves an important purpose, but it

9

serves an identifying purpose for the limiting factors

10
11

So in our reading the language "who previously

provided in (C)(iii) and (C)(iv).

It does not serve -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you are saying

12

Congress went to the trouble of spelling out this

13

elaborate provision in (C)(iii) and (ii) and all the

14

other things, but that was not the universe of the

15

situations in which there could be reimbursement?

16

went to that trouble, but then -- at the end you want to

17

say or some other provisions or some other

18

circumstances?

19

MR. SALMONS:

Well, that's right.

They

We think

20

that Congress was focused on a particular set of cases

21

where problems had arisen, and that's where you already

22

had a child in the process of receiving special

23

education and you had parents who removed the child out

24

of that process without giving adequate notice, and

25

thereby short -- excuse me -- short-circuiting an
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ongoing collaborative relationship that Congress wanted

2

to preserve.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but if -- if you avoid

4

that collaborative relationship entirely and just run

5

off to a prior -- to a private school right away, you

6

get reimbursement.

7
8

Why?

MR. SALMONS:

Well you don't automatically

get reimbursement.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. SALMONS:

Why would Congress -- huh?

You don't -- you don't

11

automatically get reimbursement, Your Honor.

12

just no categorical bar to seeking reimbursement.

13

still have to show it's an appropriate remedy, which

14

always has been understood to require a showing that the

15

parents acted reasonably and in good faith, and that

they were sincere in their efforts to obtain services

from the school.

whether they are in public or private school, have the

opportunity for a free appropriate public education.

18

With respect to children in private school

19

who are not seeking a free appropriate public school

20

education from the public school district, the only

21

requirement under the Act is that you seek them out, you

22

find them, you identify them, and that you report that

23

to the Department of Education, and that you get money

24

for those children.

disabled child?

MR. SALMONS:

It's not money to the parents,

Your Honor.

It's money to the school.

that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. SALMONS:

Well, the difficulty I have

6

with your question, Your Honor, is that the school

7

district always has a shot under the Act.

8

the school district assessed the child in 2001 and again

9

in 2003, and both times it erroneously concluded

10

In this case,

that the child -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you are simply saying

12

that it was reasonable for the parent here.

13

asking that question.

14

MR. SALMONS:

I'm not

No, not just that it's

15

reasonable, but in the process of assessing the child,

16

in developing an individual education plan that is

17

appropriate for that child, that is precisely the shot

18

that the statute gives the public school system to get

19

it right.

20

What the statute does JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Salmons, I thought

21

that the -- the courts, the district court, will not

22

provide for tuition reimbursement, unless at least two

23

things are shown.

24

not provide an adequate education for this child.

2

MR. SALMONS:

That is absolutely correct.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you must find both,

4

not just that the private school was a good place, but

5

that the school district did not offer an adequate

6

education for the child.

7

MR. SALMONS:

That is -- that is correct.

8

That is what this Court held in Carter.

9

That's what the

I would note that there is nothing in

10

the text of the statute and the provisions that

11

Petitioner relies on, (C)(ii) for example, that makes it

12

a statutory requirement to show that the private

13

placement is reasonable as a -- as a condition precedent

14

to obtain tuition reimbursement.

15

that that's required, even though it's not in the

16

statute.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But both sides concede

But procedurally we -- we

18

know that there is a provision addressed to a court for

19

equitable relief.

just misread the statute.

And again, keep in mind that

these amendments in 1997 were written against a backdrop

of this longstanding statute and this Court's

4

interpretations of it.

5

statute provides hearing officers the authority to hear

12

evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or

such child."

15

That is -- again, that has always been

16

understood to include the right to seek reimbursement

17

before the hearing officer.

18

Burlington cited legislative history from the 1975 Act

19

that noted that hearing officers could award

20

reimbursement and address such claims in concluding that

21

it was part of the appropriate relief that courts ought

to be able to have under 1415.

MR. SALMONS:

required -- this whole section, Your Honor, 1412, is

4

entitled "State Eligibility," and these are all

5

requirements that States have to provide for process in

7

requirement that States provide hearing officers that

8

have the ability to award reimbursement -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"An opportunity to present complaints with

you can raise the claim to eligibility to a -- a private

education here without the hearing officer having the

12

authority to order the school district to provide it.

13

MR. SALMONS:

That has not been the

14

interpretation of this Act, Your Honor, and I would

15

refer the Court to 34 CFR 300.148(b), which is a

16

regulation that states that hearing officers can award

17

reimbursement and that has been around since the mid

18

1980s.

19

these amendments in 1997 against a subtle understanding

20

of how this Act works.

21

that hearing officers can award reimbursement.

22

was no need to provide in the '97 amendments that

23

hearing officers can also award relief.

25

My point is that is -- the Congress enacted

There

And again because it's an -- it's an
exhaustion requirement and the judicial review provision
41
Alderson Reporting Company

the hearing officer, it makes no sense to say a court

from the hearing officer.

5

review of the Federal court action.

6

That's the subject of the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but it might make

7

senses to say that the hearing officer can determine

8

eligibility; it is then up to the school to pay it; and

9

if the school does not pay it, then you have got to go

10
11

into court and get an award.
MR. SALMONS:

In fact, Your Honor, the

12

hearing officers have always been permitted to award

13

reimbursement, as occurred in this case, and then the

14

school district can decide either to pay that or to seek

15

review if they -- if they so choose.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it might make also

17

sense to say that if the hearing officer has no

18

authority to award a certain type of relief, neither

19

does a court, under that general provision that -

20

MR. SALMONS:

But of course this Court in

21

Burlington held the court did have that authority and it

22

relied on the fact that it has always been understood

23

that hearing officers have that authority in reaching

24

that conclusion in Burlington.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right, but -- but

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

with these new provisions, if the hearing officer

2

doesn't have the authority to award the kind of relief

3

that was awarded here, then the court wouldn't either.

Well, I -- with respect, I

JUSTICE SCALIA:
we say, in pari passu -

8

MR. SALMONS:

Well, I do think that it

9

doesn't make sense to say -

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

-- that -- that whatever

the hearing officer can do, the court can do.

12

MR. SALMONS:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you agree they go, as

I think generally -- and whatever he can't

together, yes, Your Honor.

But I think they ought to be

read to provide for the authority to provide tuition

18

reimbursement.

19

One statutory point I would like to make,

20

Your Honor, is that under Petitioner's reading of the

21

Act, if you read (C)(ii) to be -- that reference to "who

22

previously received" to be an absolute precondition,

23

then I think it's the case that (C)(i) has no meaning

whatsoever.

6

7

process that warrant preservation.

8
9

It's not a precondition; it doesn't do the

One other point I make, Your Honor, and
Justice Scalia, you make reference to this principle of

10

equity, that you ought not be allowed to prevent

11

something from happening and then come into court and

12

claim, "Ha, ha, they didn't satisfy a condition."

13

that was a point that was made by Justice Cardozo in the

14

R.H. Stearns case that we rely on, where he said he who

15

prevents a thing from being done may not avail himself

16

of the nonperformance which he himself has occasioned.

17

That's precisely what happened here.

And

As

18

this case to this Court, it is established that is a

19

child who was entitled to receive special education

20

services back in 2001.

21

receive those services is because the district violated

22

its statutory duties -

23

The only reason he did not

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought in 2001 even

the parents agreed that he didn't -- that they didn't

25

want to put him in special education?
44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. SALMONS:

The parents agreed, Your

2

Honor, that he did not qualify for the learning

3

disabilities they tested him for, but they had an

4

obligation under the Act -- and this was found by the

5

hearing officer and the complaint that was filed was

6

filed within the two-year limitation to challenge that

7

2001 determination, and that that was there, they had an

8

obligation to test him for those other health

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Had Petitioner provided T.A. a special

education that was later determined to be inadequate,

there would be no question that the district court would

22

have authority and discretion to determine whether an

23

award of private school tuition reimbursement was

Petitioner's view is that because it

45
Alderson Reporting Company

1

categorically immune from such an award.

2

is not supported by the statute and it's inconsistent

3

with the reasonable interpretation of the Secretary of

4

Education.

5

That position

There is no basis for reading the statute to

6

create what effectively would be an incentive for

7

districts to stonewall and to say that if they don't -

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
right?

Well, for 10 days,

Even assuming the bad faith that you are

10

ascribing to the school district, it would only work for

11

10 days, right?

12

MR. MILLER:

Well -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And then they would

14

have -- then they would have previously received special

15

education services, and they could proceed.

We were not assuming bad faith.

incentive or to reward districts that do do that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we are talking about

2

two different things.

3

about putting the child in special education, and

4

keeping the child there for 10 days.

5

about the school district that says "no special

6

education; this child is not eligible."

7

MR. MILLER:

I think the Chief was talking

You are talking

That's absolutely right.

So in

8

a case like this, there is -- there is nothing to try

9

for 10 days because the district has found him not

10

eligible, they haven't offered any special education or

11

related services.

12

Now to the extent -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's move to

13

the situation where they have a plan that the parents

14

regard as inadequate.

15

MR. MILLER:

In the case -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In that situation

17

all they would have to do is to have the child try the

18

plan for 10 days.

19

MR. MILLER:

Well if the -- to the extent

20

that there is an interest in having parents try out the

21

plan, Petitioner's reading of the statute is poorly

22

tailored to that objective, because it doesn't require

23

that they try the specific plan that's being proposed

24

for 10 days.

25

Even under Petitioner's reading the statute
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

simply would require that the child at some point have

2

received some special education and related services.

3

It wouldn't have to be under the plan that was being

4

tried.

5

And JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the odds are that it

6

would be under the plan.

7

theoretically possible, but in the real world it's

8

probably going to be under the plan, isn't it?

9

MR. MILLER:

I mean, what you say is

Well, not necessarily because

10

there's a new plan at least once a year under the

11

statute, and they are typically proposed at the end of a

12

school year for the start of the new school year.

13

there wouldn't be, on Petitioner's reading, a

14

requirement that you show up for the first 10 days of

15

the new year; you would just have to give notice after

16

the IEP is proposed in May or June.

17

days' notice.

18

under the old plan, under the previous year.

19

-- on Petitioner's reading, the statute would be no

20

barrier to reimbursement there.

21

So

You give your 10

You receive special education services
And under

Now, of course, the district courts do have

22

considerable equitable discretion, and we're not

23

suggesting that reimbursement would be mandatory in that

24

case or in any case.

25

And -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the parents -- I

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think you agree that the parents would have the burden

2

of showing both that the school did not provide an

3

adequate education, an appropriate education, and that

4

the private school does?

5

MR. MILLER:

That's -- that's absolutely

6

right.

And they would also, in our view, have to show

7

the district court that they had genuinely cooperated

8

with the public school in making their child available

9

for evaluation -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose we thought it were

11

sensible to add to that burden the further rule that the

12

school district is presumed to have made the correct

13

diagnosis and, if there is a plan in that kind of case,

14

that the plan was adequate, and that the parent would

15

have to show by clear and convincing evidence that this

16

is not so, rather than just inventing it and pulling it

17

out of the sky.

18

Is -- is there some authority in the statute

19

that would give us warrant to do that?

20

some -- any cases that would give us warrant to -- to

21

establish a presumption of that kind in order to

22

recognize the long-standing expertise of the States in

23

this matter and in order to allow section (ii) to do

24

some work?

25

MR. MILLER:

Or is there

Well, a clear and convincing
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidence presumption would be difficult to reconcile, I

2

think, with 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), which says that the

3

district court decision should be based on the

4

preponderance of the evidence, but it is certainly

5

within the district court's discretion and it would be

6

within this Court's discretion, I think, to prescribe

7

principles to guide the exercise of the district courts'

8

equitable discretion -

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The district court

10

doesn't get into the act until the hearing officer is

11

done.

12

MR. MILLER:

Right.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so it would be odd to

14

have a presumption applicable in court that isn't also

15

applicable to the hearing officer, because the court is

16

reviewing a decision by the hearing officer.

17

MR. MILLER:

Right.

Well, the -- the

18

standard in both stages of the proceeding is by a

19

preponderance of the evidence, and the parents, as the

20

party challenging what the school has done, have the

21

burden.

22

consider whether they were genuinely seeking a free

23

appropriate public education, and I think it would be

24

entirely appropriate and consistent with the

25

preponderance standard for the hearing officer or the

But at both stages, it would be appropriate to

50

Does the -- does the

not in the statute.

MR. MILLER:

disagreements between the parents and a public agency

20

regarding the availability of a program appropriate for

21

the child and the question of financial reimbursement

22

are subject to the due process hearing procedures.

23

yes, that regulation gives hearing officers the

24

authority to award reimbursement, as indeed the hearing

25

officer had done Burlington.

So

Burlington was the case

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where the reimbursement award was made in the first

2

instance by a hearing officer, and, of course, the Court

3

held that that was appropriate.

4

And -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, this is

5

Spending Clause legislation.

6

of how much of the obligation incurred by the States is

7

reimbursed by the Federal Government?

8
9

MR. MILLER:

Do you have any rough idea

What percentage?

I think of the additional costs

of treating special education children, above those of

10

educating other children, I think approximately

11

10 percent, 10 to 12 percent, is reimbursed by the

12

Federal Government.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if this

14

interpretation vastly expands the liability of school

15

districts in that particular area, isn't that a

16

consideration we should consider?

17

the States accept 10 percent of the funds to incur these

18

obligations and then you are expanding the obligation in

19

a way that we may at least find is ambiguous, isn't that

20

a pertinent factor?

21

MR. MILLER:

Since they accept -

There's no basis for supposing

22

that there would be a vast expansion of liability, and

23

there are some statistics on this in the National

24

Disability Rights Network's amicus brief at pages 13 and

25

14.

Of about 6 million children in the United States
52

2

those are in private placements, and the vast majority

3

of those are agreed-upon placements between school

4

districts and the parents.

5

private placement is quite rare, because, first, the

6

parents do it at their own financial risk, and so

7

there's a real barrier to parents doing it, because they

have to be pretty sure that they are right and that they

only paying -- the school district only has to pay for

20

the educational component.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let me be clear.

Am I

22

correct that under -- under the theory of the statute

23

that you are supporting, it would be possible for a

24

parent, without first consulting with the school at all,

25

to put the child in a private school and then later to
54
Alderson Reporting Company

1

request public school services, and when it is -- when

2

they are denied or they are inadequate, all that public

3

school -- private school tuition would be reimbursable?

4

MR. MILLER:

There would be no categorical

5

bar in the statute in that situation, but a district

6

court confronted with those facts would most likely

7

conclude that the parents had not genuinely sought a

8

free appropriate public education and hadn't

9

appropriately cooperated with the school district.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

18

MR. FEINERMAN:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice.
I'd like to address the two provisions that

19

we have heard today for the first time.

20

government are resting their argument that tuition

21

reimbursement is permitted in the unilateral placement

22

context to students who had not previous received.

23

regulation 300.148 -- counsel referenced subsection (b),

24

Disagreements about FAPE, and it does say that the

25

hearing officer can consider the question of financial

2

entitled Reimbursement for Private School Placement, and

3

that provision speaks only to students who previously

4

received special education and related services under

5

the authority of a public agency.

6
7

And the very next subsection, (c), is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where are you reading

this?

8

MR. FEINERMAN:

This isn't -- this

9

regulation was brought up at argument.

It's not in any

10

of the addendums, but I -- I would direct the Court's

11

attention to subsection (c) of 300.148.

12

In terms of the -- the provision that T.A.'s

13

lawyer addressed, 1415(b)(6), no argument -- there's no

14

argument in the briefs that 1415(b)(6) gives hearing

15

officers the authority to grant tuition reimbursement in

16

these circumstances.

17

not rely on this provision when articulating its

18

commentary that tuition reimbursement is still permitted

19

under these circumstances.

20

relied upon the 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) provision.

21

course, refers only to courts.

22

The Department of Education did

The Secretary of Education
That of

And even if the argument were properly

23

presented, which it isn't, it would be subject to the

24

same dynamic that's in play with respect to

25

1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).

You have a very general provision
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

giving hearing officers authority.

2

specific in 1997.

3

provision under the heading Reimbursement for Private

4

School Placement.

5

where Congress intended to repose the authority of

6

hearing officers to order tuition reimbursement to

7

unilaterally placed children.

8
9

Congress got

There's a heading -- enacted a

I think that clearly indicates that's

We also have the -- and -- and it just
doesn't work to say that 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) somehow

10

gives hearing officers authority.

11

interpreted that way prior to 1997, in 1997 Congress

12

enacted the statute that expressly referenced hearing

13

officers and courts, and allowed both of them to give

14

tuition reimbursement.

15

prior to '97 -- incorrectly, we would submit -- to give

16

hearing officers that authority, after 1997 where

17

Congress actually went to the trouble of saying hearing

18

officers and courts can give tuition reimbursement in

19

certain circumstances, that -- that prior

20

interpretation, whatever its merits back then, no longer

21

is valid -

22

Even if it were

So even if 1415 were interpreted

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what happens -- what

23

happens if the hearing officer can't, but why couldn't

24

the court?

25

parents were justified, and it doesn't say there are no

I mean, they see an unusual situation.

57

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

circumstances other than -- where you couldn't -- where

2

they may not pay.

3

situation where it is -- it is equitable to pay the -

4

the reimbursement.

So the judge says, I think this is a

5

MR. FEINERMAN:

That's correct, but -

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why not?

What says you

7

can't do that, other than your basic point about the

8

"may require"?

9
10
11
12
13

MR. FEINERMAN:

The Spending Clause, the

headings that Congress used JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

But anyway, the

regs don't say anything about that.
MR. FEINERMAN:

At any rate -- and it's a

14

system that doesn't make any sense, because for children

15

who did previously receive and go to the hearing officer

16

to challenge either an eligibility determination or an

17

improper IEP, the hearing officer could award tuition

18

reimbursement, but for children who didn't previously

19

receive and then they went in front of the hearing

20

officer, they would have to -- I don't know what the

21

word would be -- appeal to the district court in order

22

to get tuition reimbursement.

23

that that could be the system -

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it conceivable that

You're saying the statute

says the hearing officer can't do that no matter what.
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

That's a separate argument.

2
3

MR. FEINERMAN:

That's correct, but I'm

saying if -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. FEINERMAN:

6

All right.
If T.A. is right, that would

be the system.

7

Thank you very much.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

The case is submitted.
