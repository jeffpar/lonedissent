Ms. Saharsky.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Respondent's conviction for battering his

11

wife is a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence

12

primarily for two reasons:

13

most naturally read that way.

14

reading would defeat Congress's purposes.

15

Nine courts of appeals have determined that the text

16

does not require a domestic relationship to be an

17

element to the predicate offense.

18

statute's text uses only one element, using the singular

19

word "element," which relates to mode of aggression.

20

then introduces a new concept related to domestic

21

relationship, using a comma and the word "committed."

22

The word "committed" naturally modifies the word

23

"offense."

24

offense; he doesn't commit a use or attempted use of

25

physical force.

First, the statutory text is
Second, a contrary

That's because the

In common usage, a person commits an

3
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Under Respondent's reading of the statute, when it was

2

enacted it would have become immediately a dead letter

3

in two-thirds of the States, and it wouldn't have any

4

application to the Federal Government.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -

Well, Respondent says that

6

may be because a lot of people in Congress wanted it to

7

be a dead letter.

8

thing to be a dead letter.

9

who didn't like this statute because it was a gun

10

There are a lot of people

control statute.

11
12

They would have wanted the whole

MS. SAHARSKY:

But Congress did act this

statute, and this Court presumes two things:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

First -

Well, if it's a compromise

14

with the people who wanted no statute at all and you

15

come out with a statute that covers one-third of the

16

States anyway, I mean that's, you know -- that's the

17

deal.

18

MS. SAHARSKY:

There was a compromise made,

19

but it wasn't with respect to whether there needed to be

20

a domestic relationship element.

21

how violent the offense had to be.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was with respect to

How do we know -- how do we

know that?
MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, if you look at the

statute's drafting history, there were two versions
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

considered.

2

discuss how violent the statute had to be, and then the

3

second substituted in the new language:

4

element the use or attempted use of physical force or

5

threatened use of a deadly weapon."

6

One used the term "crime of violence" to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"...has as an

But it also substituted

7

this structure that we are -- that we are discussing

8

today.

9
10

Didn't that come in at the same time?
MS. SAHARSKY:

The -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, why -- why say it's

11

only the former provision that was the compromise and

12

not the addition of this later language?

13

MS. SAHARSKY:

Both the original structure

14

and the statute as enacted had the same structure in

15

that they had a "committed by" clause that modified the

16

word "offense."

17

Now, it's true that the use -- "has as an

18

element language" that came in added some additional

19

structure in terms of the Romanette (i) and the

20

Romanette (ii), but that all came in because there was a

21

discussion about how violent the offense had to be, both

22

-- in the original statute that was considered, you have

23

an offense committed by a certain person, an offense of

24

a certain type committed by a certain person, and in the

25

statute that was enacted you have an offense of a
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certain type committed by a certain person.

2

Congress put more detail in, in terms of what that

3

certain type of offense is.

4

language, but it just didn't go to domestic

5

relationship.

6

Now,

This has as an "element"

And to get back to one of the earlier points

7

in your question, you know, this Court presumes when

8

Congress passes a statute two things are true:

9

it knows the legal backdrop on which it enacts the law;

10

and second, that it's presumed that its law is going to

11

have effect.

12

where Congress was dealing with a serious nationwide

13

problem of domestic violence using firearms.

14

--

15

First,

And that should be especially true here

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Congress

The suggestion was that

16

Congress may have wanted to give an incentive to States

17

to have special domestic violence statutes instead of

18

punishing domestic abusers under a generic battery

19

statute.

20

MS. SAHARSKY:

I don't think that makes

21

sense for two reasons:

First, because when Congress

22

wants to do that, it uses its spending power to give the

23

States incentives to do things like that, and it did

24

that in the VAWA enactment in 1994 and in VAWA

25

re-authorization in 2005.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And, second, because if you believe what

2

Respondents suggest, you would have to think that a

3

Congress that was very concerned about the powder keg

4

situation of a domestic offender with a gun would want

5

to exempt domestic offenders who have proven that they

6

are willing to hurt family members in two-thirds of the

7

States, a Congress that was presumed -- that was

8

concerned with the problem of domestic violence would

9

enact a statute that would apply so infrequently, to at

10

most these 17 States, and wouldn't apply at all to

11

Federal offenses, making that "misdemeanor under Federal

12

law" language superfluous.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I

14

understand your objection to the reading that your

15

friend would have us adopt, but you have the same sort

16

of problem.

17

you would have it, then the word "that" after "an

18

offense that" doesn't quite work, and have you to add

19

"is" before "is committed," if you're going to keep the

20

"that."

21

grammatically either way.

22

MS. SAHARSKY:

I mean, you've got a -- if it reads the way

So it seems to me that this doesn't work

I don't think that that's

23

right, with respect, Your Honor, because you have an

24

offense that is of a certain character committed by a

25

certain person.

5

But you've changed

You read it as if it says "an offense that
So either the "that" is out or you've got

I think that the word

6

"offense" is twice modified.

7

8

committed by a certain -

9

There is an offense that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

You use the

10

word "that" in the first example, but you skip the word

11

"that" in the second.

12

then comes (i) and (ii).

13

both of them, and you're reading it that it's an offense

14

committed, and yet under the statute it has to be an

15

"offense that committed."

16

"that" out the second time but not the first or you've

17

got to add the word "is" as it appears in (i).

18

"That" appears in the line and

MS. SAHARSKY:

In other words, that modifies

So you've either got to leave

What I'm suggesting, Your

19

Honor, is that the "that" refers to everything that is

20

in Romanette (i) and (ii) up to the break with

21

"committed by."

22

misdemeanor and has as an element "committed by."

23

know, these -- these two different clauses both modify

24

"offense," just as a grammatical matter, not looking at

25

this Romanette (i) and (ii), but just looking at that

So that it is an offense that is a

8
Alderson Reporting Company

sentence.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

that before.

Romanette?

Oh, little Roman numeral.
I've never heard

That's -- Romanette.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MS. SAHARSKY:

If you just look at this as a

8

sentence, you have "an offense that is a misdemeanor and

9

has as an element committed by."

Now, that "committed

10

by" clause, it could have come after "offense" or it

11

could be in the place where it is now.

12

these two different ways that offenses qualify.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There are just

You can't.

I mean, you

14

have the "that," and the "that" applies to both (i) and

15

(ii), and this is part of (ii).

16

either say "that committed" or -- or put in an "is" -

17

"that is committed."

18

lack of parsing is much worse than the one that you -

19

you point to in the other side's reading.

20

usual to talk about committing a use of force, but it

21

happens sometimes.

22

language, but there are many examples of such usage that

23

have been brought forth by the other side and by some of

24

the amici.

25

elegant, but people have spoken that way.

I think you've got to

It just doesn't parse, and that

Yes, it's not

It's -- it's not the most elegant

So they have something that -- it's not

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Nobody speaks

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the way you want us to speak:

"An offense that

2

committed by a person or an offense that" -- "committed

3

by a current or former..."

Nobody talks that way.

4

MS. SAHARSKY:

Two responses.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MS. SAHARSKY:

Nobody.
Two responses, Your Honor.

7

First, the "committed by" language refers back to

8

"offense" and the "that" is just part of this -- this

9

first clause, but -- and we believe that the

10

Government's reading is the most logical reading.

11

think of it this way:

12

if there were a hard return before the "committed by"

13

language, that it's clear -- that it would be more clear

14

that the Government's reading is correct.

15

And

You know, Respondent agrees that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I wouldn't agree with that.

16

You'd still have the "that" up above.

17

have a hard return and take out the "that" or -- or that

18

(A) is a misdemeanor, "has as an element" and then a

19

hard return, and you have to add "and is committed."

20

You still have to add language besides the hard return.

21

MS. SAHARSKY:

You would have to

With respect, Your Honor, we

22

think this can be read as all one sentence.

But just to

23

make my second point, which is:

24

do much more violence, Respondent's reading of the

25

statute, than you suggest because you're talking about

I think that it would

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

treating the singular word "element" as plural.

2

talking about ignoring the comma that separates the "has

3

as an element" section from the "committed by" section,

4

and then you're talking about taking what even the

5

linguists who filed a brief in this case essentially in

6

support of Respondents say is a very weird usage of

7

"committed."

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
sorry.

You're

How do you -- I'm

I'm not following why "element" is singular.

10

The argument on the other side, I understood, is that

11

the element is the use of physical force committed by a

12

current or former spouse.

13

singular.

14

change would you have to make to the word "element" to

15

adopt their reading?

16

So "element" is still

I -- maybe I'm missing something.

MS. SAHARSKY:

What

We think that you'd say -

17

you'd have to say "has as its elements" to suggest that

18

you would take two very diverse concepts and make them

19

both required elements of the underlying offense.

20

There are two concepts here:

One is how

21

violent the offense has to be, and then there's the

22

second concept, which is a class of defendants, and

23

that's a very different concept.

24

the singular "element," "has as an element," and then

25

you see, oh, okay, it has to be violent.

But if you just see

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but I thought

2

the whole point of this was to get at violence committed

3

by a family member, and if that's the critical element,

4

you don't have to have two different elements,

5

"violence" and then "committed."

6

committed by a family member.

7

MS. SAHARSKY:

It's violence

Well, with respect, Your

8

Honor, we think that because Congress broke these up

9

into these two different clauses -- one that relates to

10

violence and then a separate clause that's introduced by

11

"committed by" where "committed" naturally modifies

12

"offense" -- that it was treating -- that these were two

13

separate requirements.

14

was trying to get at the problem of violent domestic

15

offense, and if it was doing that it would make no sense

16

at all for Congress to -- to have enacted a statute that

17

would such extremely limited application.

18

course, Respondent's reading would make the "is a

19

misdemeanor under Federal law" superfluous.

20

And you're right that Congress

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And, of

If we think that

21

there are two awkward readings, yours and your friend's,

22

and both of them require surgery, don't we resolve that

23

under the rule of lenity?

24

MS. SAHARSKY:

25

No.

The rule of lenity says

that there needs to be a grievous ambiguity after this
12
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Court seizes aid -- any aid which can be derived from

2

the tools of statutory interpretation.

3

we think that the text here is most naturally read in

4

the Government's way, every other indicia of meaning

5

here points in favor of the Government's interpretation.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So even though

What -- what -- what's

7

been the underlying rationale for the rule of lenity,

8

which is a rule I think we should apply with great

9

caution?

10

But if we think -- what's the reason for the

rule of lenity?

11

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think one of the -- the

12

main concerns is providing fair notice of what's

13

illegal.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Fair notice.

It -- it -

15

it seems to me that if I were counsel practicing

16

criminal law in the private sector, and I negotiated a

17

plea for simple assault, but there was a spouse that was

18

involved, and then I walked down the courthouse step

19

with my clients, said we got a good deal, and

20

incidentally, all guns in your house must immediately be

21

surrendered to other people, you must take them all out,

22

you may never hunt, you may never possess a gun.

23

And under your view, if I don't say that I'm

24

guilty of, it seems to me, serious malpractice.

25

don't see that there is notice to the legal profession.

I just

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well certainly, Your Honor,

we think that the statutory text is clear, and that's

because people are presumed to know the law.

Where the context is,

we are asking why the rule of lenity and the rule of

10

lenity is to ensure notice.

11

a classic case where there has to be notice.

12

come back and say that even if the statute had been

13

written as to apply specifically to domestic crimes, a

14

lot of attorneys wouldn't have had notice on it when it

15

was an omnibus budget bill added at the last minute.

few States had statutes with a domestic relationship

noticing in this case is that you know, the Senator,

legislation, was from New Jersey; and other Respondent's

Is it

a parenthetical (iii), closed paren, "is committed by"?

2

If -- now there is the element of "attempted use of

force" is one, is the second requirement; and the third

4

requirement is that it be committed by a current or

5

former spouse.

6

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I think -

So your -- your reading --

8

I'm just following up on the Chief Justice's question -

9

requires us to assume that Congress really intended

10

there to be a triple "i" as well as a double "i", and

11

the triple "i" would have begun with the verb "is."

12

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think that that's one way

13

of doing it, but I don't think that you have to do that,

14

because if you look at the structure of this sentence -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it is true, is it not,

16

that if you did do it that way, it would have been a lot

17

clearer than it is now?

18

MS. SAHARSKY:

There are ways that Congress

19

could have made its manifest intent even more clear.

20

could have added that Romanette (iii); it could put a

21

hard return before "committed by."

22

the effect that the statute would have, if you read it

23

Respondent's way, I don't think that we can reasonably

24

expect that Congress -- a Congress that wanted to get at

25

the serious nationwide problem of domestic violence
16
Alderson Reporting Company

But if you look at

using firearms, would have wanted to enact a statute

that would have such limited effect.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I want to follow up on

4

Justice Kennedy's inquiry about the rule of lenity.

5

Don't you think the rule of lenity is particularly

6

important when you're dealing with conduct that is not

7

malum in se?

8

going to apply the rule of lenity to a statute that

posits an increased sentence for kneecapping or for some

I mean, to say that, well, we are not

language that you say makes his owning of a firearm

Is that right?

Yes.

suspect that because he committed a misdemeanor, he

cannot have a firearm?

When -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think anybody would

assume that.

mere misdemeanor, as opposed to a felony.

a little (iii) where there is not a little (iii).

2

he -- well, you did not plead guilty or you are not

3

accused of the offense of using violence against a

5

using violence, a misdemeanor.

6

And

You're just -- just accused of -- of

MS. SAHARSKY:

Two thoughts on that, Your

7

Honor.

The first is, you know, at the time that this

8

statute was enacted almost all of the States except for

9

this small number prosecuted offenses that were domestic

10

disturbance offenses like the one in this case under

11

general assault and battery statutes, and even the 17

12

States that have those with the domestic relations,

13

offenses with the domestic relationship requirement,

14

still prosecute them routinely as assault and battery

15

under those general statutes.

16

So I think a person -- A, an attorney who

17

handles those kind of cases would have knowledge of that

18

law; and B, a person who has committed a serious violent

19

offense like Respondent's previous offense in this case

20

should be on notice that his possession of firearms

21

might be regulated.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

assault and battery, wasn't it?

4

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes, that's right.

I mean, I

really -

5
6

And this was misdemeanor

JUSTICE SCALIA:
offense.

7

So it's not that serious an

That's why we call it a misdemeanor.
MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, I mean, certainly the

8

offense is this particular case was serious.

The

9

charging document reflects that Respondent hit his wife

10

all around the face until it swelled out, kicked her all

11

around her body, kicked here in the ribs -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Then he should have been

13

charged with a felony, but he wasn't.

14

with a misdemeanor.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He was charged

Wasn't the -- wasn't the

16

statute responding to just that problem, that domestic

17

abuse tended to be charged as misdemeanors rather than

18

felonies?

19

responding to when he included misdemeanor.

20

purpose of this was to make a misdemeanor battery count

21

for the statute's purpose.

22

And it was that fact that the Senator was

MS. SAHARSKY:

The whole

That's exactly right, Justice

23

Ginsburg.

All of the discussion of this in Congress

24

said we need to have a zero tolerance towards people -

25

zero tolerance policy towards people who are -- have
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

proven that they are willing to commit violent acts

2

against family members; and we already have a statute

3

that prohibits felons from possessing firearms, but we

4

know that sometimes these domestic offenses get charged

5

as misdemeanors.

6

said in the legislative record they are often charged as

7

offenses like assault and battery, and we need to get at

8

these offenses because these people should not have

9

firearms.

And Senator Lautenberg specifically

They should not put their families in that

10

type of powder keg situation, and they -- we should not

11

be putting police in that type of situation, where

12

police who respond to a domestic disturbance call like

13

the 911 call in this case are put in a dangerous

14

situation with a person -- an emotionally charged

15

situation -- who would have a firearm.

16

One other point that I wanted to make with

17

respect to your question, Justice Scalia -- and this is

18

not with respect to how this case should be resolved,

19

but just as a practical matter -- that the VAWA 2005

20

amendments do require States, for a condition of their

21

grant funding, to have a judicial policy that gives

22

notice for offenses like assault and battery that a

23

person would not be able to possess a firearm.

24
25

And the reason that they are doing that is
not because, you know, as a constitutional matter we
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think that they need to, but because they really --

2

Congress just really wants to keep firearms away from

3

people who have shown that they are willing to hurt

4

family members in this way.

5

Now, I talked a little bit in the beginning

6

of argument about how really every -- every indicia of

7

meaning in this case -- and we do look to -- to each of

8

those different interpretive tools before we would

9

invoke the rule of lenity -- points in favor of the

10

Government's construction.

11

text, and I think we've -- we've covered those

12

arguments.

13

would have an extremely limited effect if it didn't -

14

if it were interpreted as Respondent suggests.

15

First of all, you've got the

But just as a practical matter, this statute

The language with respect to Federal

16

misdemeanors would be superfluous because the way that

17

Federal offenses like domestic assaults on Army bases

18

are charged is under a general Federal assault statute.

19

There isn't one that's specific to domestic violence.

20

So Congress would have put this "misdemeanor under

21

Federal law" language in there, and it -- it would have

22

immediately had no effect either.

23

You know, the -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it seems there

24

is no Federal misdemeanor that covers this particular

25

type of assault, in other words?
22

2

MS. SAHARSKY:

There is -- there is a

general Federal assault statute.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

But it doesn't have a

5

domestic relationship requirement, and that's the

6

problem.

7

just a bit, and I -- I think that, you know, every

8

indicia -- every indication in the drafting history,

9

both if you compare the first version of the bill with

You know, we also look to the drafting history

10

the statute that was enacted and the discussion relating

11

to it, shows that this language "has as an element,"

12

which really only intended to get at how violent an

13

offense had to be, it -- it was never intended to get at

14

any kind of domestic relationship requirement.

course, the -- the sponsor -

care what Congress intended.

MS. SAHARSKY:

Of course not, Justice

Scalia.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MS. SAHARSKY:

Of course.
We look to the text first,

6

but we also look to other indicia -- many of us also

7

look to other indicia of Congress's intent.

8

those indicia include things like a comparison of the

9

drafting history and Senator Lautenberg's statement,

And some of

10

which is directly on point here, which says that

11

offenses like assault and battery would be covered.

12

This is a -- a powerful tool.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how does that

14

relate to the rule of lenity?

15

Justice Kennedy's point, you're saying that the lawyer

16

would not only be obligated to read this, but in

17

advising his client would be obligated to go back and

18

read the drafting history and the legislative history.

19

Do we really use those types of materials to trump the

20

-- the rule of lenity?

21

MS. SAHARSKY:

I suppose, to get back to

This Court has in -- in

22

multiple cases looked to the fact that the statute, for

23

example, would have such a narrow, limited purpose, in

24

addition to the statute's text, to say, you know, we

25

can't believe Congress would expect that purpose 24

So the lawyer

advising his client in the typical assault case is

supposed to know at the time that only 17 States had

this type of provision?

5

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think it was well known at

7

had the domestic relationship element, were commonly

8

prosecuted as assault and battery offenses.

Should we pick this

And, aside from looking at the legislative

history, there is a separate section of the Court's

opinion where you said:

basically nowhere and we just can't think that Congress

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TROY N. GIATRAS

4
5
6
7

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GIATRAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
The fundamental flaw in the Government's

8

argument is that it describes a statute that Congress

9

considered but did not pass.

In the statute's final

10

version Congress defined the "misdemeanor crime of

11

domestic violence" to require that the predicate offense

12

have as an element a domestic relationship between the

13

offender and the victim.

14

And the Government's reading ignores the

15

legislative compromise that led to the contested

16

language; and, if adopted by this Court, would rewrite

17

the statute and hand one side the legislative victory

18

that they were unable to achieve in Congress.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, wait.

You say that

20

that was the compromise.

21

evidence to -- to show that that was an intentional -

22

an intentional alteration made in the House of

23

Representatives.

24
25

Do you?

MR. GIATRAS:

I don't know that you have any

I mean There is nothing that speaks

to the words in the House of Representatives in the
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congressional Record, Your Honor, but their inaction and

2

the lack of words speak very loudly.

3

March of 1996, when the legislation was introduced, and

4

then it went over to the House after passing

5

significantly in the Senate, it was stalled, and it was

6

stymied, and it did not move.

7

And it was -- from

As a matter of fact, it had to at one time

8

be taken from a -- and put into the stalking bill and

9

then removed from the stalking bill and replaced back in

10

then to a postal bill, which was then modified into the

11

appropriations bill.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the other side says

13

that the reason that was the case was that they objected

14

to the fact that -- what was its language -- the -- the

15

old version did not say a "misdemeanor crime of domestic

16

violence."

17

It was -- it was broader.
MR. GIATRAS:

It certainly was broader, but

18

there was nothing -- and there was no one that spoke in

19

the House of Representatives on that matter.

20

was only one -- the principal author of the legislation,

21

the sponsor, spoke in the Senate.

22

the eleventh hour on September 28th of 1996 that this

23

entire change was made.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And there

And it was not until

use of force -- to make it clear is a misdemeanor -- had

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Thank you.

I apologize.
While we pause, can I just

15

ask you one question to make sure I understand the two

16

-- two different positions?

17

ii is that the meaning you attributed to it is -- would

18

be exactly the same if you left out the word

19

"committed"?

20

view the word -- either the word "committed" or the

21

words "committed by" is superfluous?

22

MR. GIATRAS:

23
24
25

Your view of the subsection

In other words, it seems to me under your

No.

That is part of the

element -- the one element that is required.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why would you need that in

there if the statute means -- if the element is the use
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of force by a family member?

2

another verb, "committed"?

3

MR. GIATRAS:

Why do you have to put in

Well, because that's who -

4

that's who it would -- that's who it would address to.

5

And that would be with respect to -- when you look at

6

the definition that's set forth, it was to change from

7

the original -- original -

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:
in changes.

Well, I'm not interested

I'm just interested in the text before us.

10

And it seems to me that your reading of the statute is

11

exactly what the statute would say if it did not include

12

the word "committed."

13
14

MR. GIATRAS:

I -- I don't know, Justice.

I

don't believe so, though.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I agree with

16

Justice Stevens.

17

It not only has the same effect, but it's more natural,

18

because it's "use of force by a current or former

19

spouse," as opposed to "use of force committed by."

20

Read it without the word "committed."

MR. GIATRAS:

It would still include -- it

21

would still include both attributes into the one element

22

even if the word "committed" were removed from double

23

ii, yes.

24
25

I'm -- I'm sorry about that.
JUSTICE BREYER:

As I read this old one -

as I read the first one, Senator Lautenberg put in the
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

language, and his language in the first one was to say

2

I'll tell you a group of people who shouldn't have guns.

3

The people who commit a crime of domestic violence.

4

Now what's that?

In the statute he says it

5

is a misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a person

6

in a family relation with the victim.

7

Then he says after, I changed that language

8

a little.

I'll tell you why.

Because somebody told me

9

misdemeanor crime of violence is too broad.

10

include cutting up a credit card.

11

more specifically.

12

It could

So I'll define it

And he defines if more specifically to say

13

that it is a crime that has as an element the use or

14

attempted use of physical force or threatening people

15

with a weapon.

16

End of the matter.

They substitute those words and they did

17

another thing the drafter as he breaks out the thing it

18

says:

19

and that's where the problem is, because if you put in a

20

"that," then you have to have an "is."

21

the "is."

22
23
24
25

It is a crime that is a misdemeanor and, you see,

So he left out

Okay.
So I say what did Senator Lautenberg want

with these words?

I see.

How did he change it?

I see.

I can't find a word that supports the reason
that you have.

Now, maybe they are there.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

That's what

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you'll tell me.

2

And then I say it's the fine language

3

consistent with what he wanted.

4

an "is."

your argument against you.

6

to rebut that.

7

It requires putting in

I don't find that too awful.

MR. GIATRAS:

Okay.

What is it?

That's

Your argument

The legislation that the

8

Senator introduced was not the legislation that was

9

passed by Congress.

And, Justice Breyer, it is very

10

clear from the statutory and legislative history in this

11

case from -- you just take up through September 28th of

12

1996, that the sponsor of the legislation decries with

13

respect to the staunch opposition that was in the House,

14

and the fact that his bill was going nowhere.

15

have been his intended purpose with respect to what was

16

introduced, but it was then the will of Congress with

17

changing -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

This may

That's the conclusion.

19

You're reaching that conclusion.

What I need from you

20

is something that would tell me, no, Congress didn't

21

just want to clarify in the way Lautenberg said.

22

they wanted to do was, in fact, restrict the scope of

23

this so it only applied in 17 states.

24

to that argument.

25

point me to the things that suggest that that is what

Okay.

I'm open

It could be a good argument.

MR. GIATRAS:

15

was passed in the Senate as the "as introduced"

language.

25

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Are you saying

Official - Subject to Final Review

that Senator Lautenberg did not change the words

2

"misdemeanor crime of violence" to the words "use of

3

physical force" or "threatened use of deadly weapon"?

4

That's what he got up on the floor of the Senate and

5

said that he wanted to change.

6

MR. GIATRAS:

Justice, as this Court has

7

articulated in Allapattah, that sometimes there can be a

8

strategic manipulation to secure results.

I'm not -- we're in -- the

10

question specifically is where did the words come from?

MR. GIATRAS:

The use or attempted use of

And

14

you're saying that in the House there were some people

16

MR. GIATRAS:

Yes, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. GIATRAS:

And how do we know that?

Well, by the mere fact that

19

they -- we don't have them speaking to it, because there

20

was no actual congressional record of them speaking to

21

it or someone taking to the floor in the House of

22

Representatives.

23

It's absolutely silent.

We have to, instead, go back to what Senator

24

Lautenberg was saying on the floor of the Senate during

25

this period of time, where he made very clear that what

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Other than a desire to

weaken this bill as much as possible, can you think of

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you really think there is

If you had been advising

and you read this, would you say well, you know, you're

7

-- it's a good thing that you were convicted of this in

West Virginia, where there isn't a specific statute

If you had been convicted in another State under a

specific domestic violence statute then you wouldn't be

able to possess firearms but you're home free because of

the nature of the statute in your State?

MR. GIATRAS:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MS. SAHARSKY:

Thank you.

In this case, the

10

Court has a choice between either reading the statute in

11

a way that uses the words very unnaturally and unusually

12

-- "committed by" to modify "use" and "element" -

13

treating a singular as plural, and the word "committed"

14

--

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if I could

16

stop you there.

17

States Code, 1 U.S.C. section 1, says the singular

18

includes the plural.

19

The very first sentence in the United

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right, and this Court has

20

said that you do that only when two things are true:

21

When it makes sense in context, and we think it doesn't

22

because of the word "committed," which Respondent wants

23

to read right out of the statute, and also because you

24

do it when it's necessary to fulfill the evident

25

purposes of the statute.

And here, for the reasons we
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

explained, treating the singular as plural would be

2

contrary to the purposes of the -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know, but

4

basically what you're saying is we don't follow 1 U.S.C.

5

section 1 because our reading is correct.

6

well, it doesn't -- you know, in context it doesn't

7

fulfill the purposes and therefore we read "element" as

8

singular only rather than according to section 1 of the

9

United States Code.

10

MS. SAHARSKY:

If they said,

It's because the element -

11

the singular "element" has other indicia meaning it

12

involves the word "committed" and then also this -- the

13

fact that Congress's objective would be stymied if you

14

took Respondent's reading.

15

So you've got a choice between just using

16

the words unnaturally -- "committed by," taking

17

"committed" and just making it superfluous, as in

18

Respondent's view, or treating the singular "element" as

19

plural, or you can give, as the Government is

20

suggesting, a natural and logical reading that you're

21

talking about an offense of this certain violent

22

character committed by these certain people.

23

that involves looking slightly past Romanette (i) and

24

(ii) structure to look at this being two clauses that

25

both modify the word "offense."
