ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. McALLISTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

The Court has always held that the

11

defendant's voluntary statements obtained in violation

12

of constitutional standards may be used for impeachment

13

purposes when the defendant testifies at trial.

14

The Court has excluded statements for all

15

purposes only when they are involuntary or have been

16

compelled.

17

voluntary statements obtained in violation of the rule

18

of Massiah v. United States should be treated

19

differently than all other voluntary statements.

20

The question in this case is whether

The answer is "no" for at least three

21

reasons.

22

voluntary statements obtained in violation of

23

constitutional standards is necessary to prevent perjury

24

by criminal defendants.

25

First, permitting the impeachment use of

Second, in terms of the effect at trial,
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is no basis for distinguishing a voluntary

2

statement obtained in violation of the Massiah rule from

3

Fourth Amendment violations, Miranda violations, or

4

violations of the rule of Michigan v. Jackson.

5

In all of those situations the resulting

6

evidence may limit defense counsel's options at trial,

7

but there is no basis in that respect for distinguishing

8

a Massiah violation.

9

those others.

It has no different effect than

Also, the Sixth Amendment right to

10

counsel does not include a right to commit perjury or to

11

have the assistance of counsel in presenting false

12

testimony.

13
14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When does -- when does the

Sixth Amendment violation occur?
MR. McALLISTER:

That question, Your Honor,

16

as you realize, is debated a bit in the briefs, it's --

17

Kansas for purposes of deciding this case, is willing to

18

accept the position of the United States and the

19

Respondent that it occurs when the statement is admitted

20

at trial, although the cases have not necessarily

21

definitively resolved that question.

22

it is unnecessary to answer the question, because it's a

23

minimal point in terms of potential deterrence -

24

deterrence that operate in this segment -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We, frankly, think

Do you -- do we have any
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other situation in which, for purposes of impeaching

2

testimony, a constitutional violation results?

3

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, that's the -- that is

4

one of the intricacies of this particular question,

5

although arguably in the Fifth Amendment context

6

certainly the Miranda warnings are given.

7

don't do that.

8

violation, it's analogous in many ways, if one looks

9

back at the cases.

10

The police

And if that is the completion of the

The Court has suggested that the actual

11

violation is the use of the statement at trial against

12

the defendant, not simply obtaining it without the

13

necessary warnings being given.

14

is, in fact -

So we would argue that

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's parallel to the Fifth.

16

MR. McALLISTER:

It's parallel to the Fifth

17

in this respect, and certainly, it's distinct from the

18

Fourth in that respect.

19

at the end of the day.

20

Fourth Amendment, so that the violation is complete when

21

the police send in an informant and he works hard to

22

elicit statements in violation of the Messiah law, if

23

it's complete at that time, then all of the analysis

24

from the Fourth Amendment cases is equally applicable

25

here.

But we don't think it matters
If one were to treat it like the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

If the violation does not occur until it's

2

presented at trial, then it's analogous more to the

3

Fifth Amendment and also to the Michigan v. Jackson and

4

Michigan v. Harvey cases, which were Sixth Amendment

5

right to counsel violations, in which case the Court

6

said it was wrong for the police to initiate

7

interrogation after he invoked his right but will let

8

the statement be admitted for impeachment purposes.

9

it is exactly analogous to what the Court did in Harvey

10

So

itself.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would it make no

12

difference, I take it, General McAllister, if this had

13

been a police officer who was pretending to be a

14

cellmate?

15

a police officer doing inside the cell what he couldn't

16

do outside; that is, the police officer outside wants to

17

interrogate, must inform the arrestee of his Miranda

18

rights, but inside the cell, the police could pretend to

19

be a jailbird and they can get the information that way.

20

Is that -

21

In this case it was a snitch, but it could be

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

22

believe that is correct if -- if it's for example, an

23

undercover officer, someone has gone in -- in fact,

24

there are cases such as Weatherford v. Bursey that

25

involved an undercover agent who was present for
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

meetings with the defendant and his counsel, and the

2

Court indicated that the presence alone would not

3

violate the right to counsel.

4

solicitation and use of statements obtained from the

5

defendant that would violate the Sixth Amendment.

6

It's the deliberate

So if a cellmate, another defendant, is the

7

informant who listens and hears, it wouldn't make any

8

difference under the Court's cases if, in fact, it was a

9

police officer pretending to be a cellmate who listens

10

and hears.

Just as it wouldn't make -- it wouldn't be a

11

violation if there were a recording device in the cell

12

and the defendant talked to himself, which there are

13

cases of that, and it was picked up on the recording

14

device.

15

is a violation at all.

16

wouldn't matter for our purposes.

The mere listening, that goes to whether there

17

But the who, there is -- it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, the police know that

18

they can get around the clear prohibition of their

19

questioning without Miranda warnings by pretending to be

20

a jailbird?

21

MR. McALLISTER:

Potentially, yes.

But,

22

again, the violation would go to what happens in the

23

cell.

24

another defendant and sits in the cell and the defendant

25

starts telling the officer things, that would not

So if the police officer is pretending to be

violate the Sixth Amendment at all under the -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, I am assuming we are

3

not in the area where the jail mate is simply passive.

4

In this case, the jail mate made a statement that

5

encouraged the defendant.

6

was encouraging the defendant to speak.

7

MR. McALLISTER:

He wasn't just passive.

He

There was certainly

8

testimony about what he was told to do and what he did.

9

It does not suggest aggressive efforts, certainly, to

10

find out.

11

he certainly didn't say, tell me what you did, let's

12

talk about your crimes.

13

suggestive statement to the -

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15
16

He may not have been completely silent, but

But he did make one arguably

Anyway, your answer is

the police officer could affirmatively elicit testimony?
MR. McALLISTER:

No, not that he could

17

affirmatively elicit.

18

the Massiah and Kuhlmann case.

19

well, I guess what I'm suggesting is -

20

That's the dividing line between

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He was in the cell -

And for your -- you are

21

talking about impeachment only.

22

about the case in chief.

23

can't -- outside, when he questions the defendant and

24

gives no Miranda warnings, that is inadmissible, right?

25

We are not talking

So if the police -- he

MR. McALLISTER:

Outside -- well, it would

Alderson Reporting Company

still be admissible for impeachment.

2

basically the same rule.

3

he were in the cell, deliberately elicits, knows he is

violating Massiah, it couldn't be used in the government

5

case in chief, but it could be used for impeachment

6

purposes.

7

officer deliberately failed to give the warnings, got a

8

statement, they would not be admissible in the case in

It would be the same thing if

But that would be true of Miranda, if the

admissible for impeachment purposes.

11
12

We are asking for

So we are asking for a precise parallel
rule.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You are making no

14

distinction, then, between the Fifth and Sixth

15

Amendment?

16

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, there may be

17

distinctions, and there is an distinction in the text of

18

the Fifth Amendment that suggests actually a rule of

19

exclusion when you truly have -- when there truly is a

20

compelled statement.

21

in cases such as Portash, where the witness has given

22

use immunity, testifies before the grand jury and the

23

government later tries to use it against him.

24

says, no, you cannot use that testimony for any purpose.

25

And the Court has recognized that

The Court

So there is a difference between the Sixth
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Amendment and Fifth Amendment in that respect.

2

But what I was suggesting is the way Massiah

3

and Miranda operate is similar in this context, that a

4

violation results in suppression of the evidence from

5

the government's case in chief, but it remains available

6

for use as impeachment.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the argument

8

that essentially this is like taking a pretrial

9

deposition, only one side isn't represented?

10

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, with all due respect

11

to that argument, Your Honor, we disagree with that.

12

There are strong incentives for the police, frankly, not

13

to do this.

14

there is two.

15

in violation of the Sixth Amendment, then nothing can be

16

used in the case in chief.

17

impeachment if the defendant testifies and if the

18

defendant testifies inconsistently with whatever is

19

elicited.

20

And in part one of the reasons -- well,
One is the police know if this is truly

So, at most, it is

But furthermore, given the line the court

21

has drawn between Massiah and Kuhlmann and what goes on

22

with the informant in the cell, if they can hear the

23

statements without deliberately eliciting them, if you

24

will, if the informant is present, the defendant wants

25

to talk, starts chatting, they discuss the crime, those
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statements, the Court has held in Kuhlmann, are

2

admissible for all purposes, because they are not a

3

Sixth Amendment violation at all.

4

So, the police do have some strong

5

incentives to actually try to gather the evidence, if

6

they are going to, in a way that makes it usable in the

7

prosecution's case in chief.

8

having it solely for impeachment, which is always going

9

to be speculative if it were ever going to be used.

It's much less value to

10

would depend on if the defendant testifies and if he

11

testifies inconsistently with what he has told an

12

informant.

13

It

And in that regard, there are other

14

deterrents I would like to mention here as well.

The

15

informant in this case, for example, in jail recognized

16

that he did not want to be an aggressive questioner or

17

obvious as a government agent.

18

didn't really want to ask him questions because I was

19

afraid if he felt I was being too nosey, I might get

20

hurt.

21

be careful here.

In fact, he said, I

So, the informants have their own incentives to

22

And in this case, it's also important to

23

remember that deterrence is simply one side of the

24

balance.

25

there would be some deterrent effect to extending the

And the Court has said many times even if

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rule to include impeachment, that doesn't answer the

2

question whether it should, in fact, be excluded.

3

still must be weighed against the costs on the other

4

side.

5

That

And the Court has numerous cases emphasizing

6

the costs that are present on the other side of this

7

case.

8

but also cases talking about the importance of allowing

9

the jury to hear the truth and to search for truth.

Perjury by criminal defendants is a primary one,

10

The jury here gets to evaluate and did, I

11

would argue, quite effectively from Mr. Ventris's

12

standpoint, evaluate the defendant's credibility.

13

jury was informed, cross-examination, of the informant's

14

circumstances, what benefit he received, who he was, all

15

the things they might want to know in deciding whether

16

to believe him.

17

primarily to the question of who was the shooter in the

18

murder in the case, and the jury acquitted Mr. Ventris

19

of the murder charge, so they did not believe, at least

20

beyond a reasonable doubt, that he in fact was the

21

shooter.

22

The

His testimony went not solely but

And that is precisely how this should work.
We are not saying informants are always

23

100 percent reliable, but we are saying the court has a

24

long tradition, the country has a long tradition, of

25

putting this evidence in front of a jury.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

It's tested

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

by cross-examination, knowledge of what the incentives

2

are, bringing that out in front of the jury, and then

3

the jury decides.

4

-- this was a typical, one codefendant saying, "he was

5

the shooter," the other defendant saying, "no, she was

6

the shooter."

7

There are many of these cases where

And the informant simply had information

8

that was relevant to the credibility.

And that's the

9

way it was used in this case, was as impeachment on

10

rebuttal to evaluate Mr. Ventris's testimony in whether

11

the jury believed him or not.

12

The other thing I would remind the Court is

13

we are simply saying that the rule should be no

14

exclusion under the Sixth Amendment for impeachment

15

purposes, but that does not mean that the normal rules

16

of evidence and other rules of trial procedure do not

17

apply.

18

exclusion of some potential informant's testimony.

19

if the government were to want to put on an informant

20

who had been convicted many times of perjury and the

21

judge said, no, I just do not think this evidence is

22

credible enough to even put in front of the jury, not

23

this person, the ordinary rules of evidence and trial

24

procedure would operate.

25

this case, the judge can, and often will, give

They do.

And they might well result in the
So

Furthermore, as happened in

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

cautionary instructions, limiting instructions.

2

that remains appropriate, but there is simply no reason

3

to exclude the evidence as a matter of the Sixth

4

Amendment right to counsel.

5

All of

It would be inconsistent, frankly, with -

6

with, really, the general tone and holdings of the cases

7

in the Fourth Amendment, Miranda, and even Sixth

8

Amendment territory, including primarily

9

Michigan v. Harvey and Nix v. Williams.

Unless the Court has further questions, I
will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

that Respondent's statements were voluntary, and the

snitches, do they get disciplined, especially if they

10

That is, the -- the testimony -- the snitch is then able

11

to testify after the defendant testifies.

12

MS. SAHARSKY:

I don't think that there is

13

any evidence in the briefs, and I am not aware of

14

specific instances of discipline, but I think that that

15

is because this situation arises pretty infrequently.

16

You know, when this came up in the Kansas Supreme Court

17

it was a case of first impression.

18

McAllister noted, there are a lot of reasons why the

19

police would want to follow the rule in Kuhlman and send

the informant in to be a passive listening post.

Because if -

MS. SAHARSKY:

Again, I think that most

police officers just follow the rule that this Court set

forth in Kuhlman, so that this issue has not arisen

there would be some type of minimal deterrence benefit

7

that would arise from -- from not making the evidence

it against the cost to the truth-seeking process that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me that that

3

all confirms the fact, well, they have nothing to lose.

4

Maybe we have one witness who is not very persuasive,

5

but no harm in giving it a try.

6

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think that the -- the fact

7

that the evidence would be unavailable in the

8

government's case-in-chief really is a strong price that

9

the government pays.

And -- and this Court recognized

10

it in in Havens, in Walder, in Harris, in Hass, in

11

Harvey, and in all of those prior cases.

12

just -- there is not any reason to depart from them,

13

because the -- the other side of the balance is that,

14

you know, you are letting a defendant to get up and take

15

the stand and -- and not subject himself to this prior

16

statement.

17

And there is

And this -- this prior statement, if

18

believed by the jury, is incredibly important to his

19

credibility, probative with respect to whether the

20

crimes were committed and the defendant is telling the

21

truth.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If it is truthfully

23

reported.

Of course, that is always -- that is an issue

24

of credibility in all of these cases.

25

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes, every case has a
20

Alderson Reporting Company

1

question about someone's credibility, some witness's

2

credibility, and that's for the jury to decide.

3

-- in this case there was ample cross-examination, and

4

there was the limiting instruction that the State

5

mentioned.

6

And in

I mean, clearly the jury did its job here

7

because it went back and it considered all this

information.

And it didn't come back with a -- a

10

what the jury is thinking, it didn't come back with a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Saharsky, I am still a

14

little hung up on -- on whether we would be allowing a

15

constitutional violation.

16

in the Fifth Amendment area we -- we indeed allow -

17

allow it to be introduced in rebuttal even though that

18

is the actual constitutional violation.

19

case other than in the Miranda situation?

20

suppose you have a generally coerced confession.

21

we -- would we permit that to go in?

22

MS. SAHARSKY:

General McAllister said that

Certainly not.

Isn't that the
I mean,
Would

In the Fifth

23

Amendment context, the text of the amendment itself

24

would prohibit the use of that statement for any

25

purposes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly, but why -- why is

not that the case with the right to counsel?

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

Because the text of the Sixth

4

Amendment doesn't say anything about the exclusion of

5

evidence at trial. What it does is it guarantees counsel

6

for a purpose, and that purpose is to ensure an

7

adversary process at trial. And if counsel is not

8

afforded, then it's up to the court to determine what

9

the remedy is -

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

that counsel is guaranteed at trial; isn't that right?

12
13
14

But its real meaning is

MS. SAHARSKY:

I'm sorry.

I missed the

first JUSTICE SCALIA:

Its root purpose is that

15

counsel is guaranteed at trial.

16

it's okay not to have counsel at trial so long as it's

17

refuting a lie by the defendant.

18

MS. SAHARSKY:

And here we're saying

That's not true. I mean,

19

certainly counsel is available at trial. The question is

20

just whether statements that were obtained without

21

counsel prior to trial can be used for impeachment

22

purposes. The answer -

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you say that -- you say

the Sixth Amendment violation occurs before trial?
MS. SAHARSKY:

I'm sorry if I suggested
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that.

No, the Sixth Amendment violation occurs when the

2

statements are introduced in the government's case in

3

chief at trial.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MS. SAHARSKY:

That's right.
And that's because the

6

government should not be allowed to go behind counsel

7

prior to trial and gather up statements, and then use

8

them to prove guilt at trial. That subverts the

9

adversary process. When you are talking about

10

impeachment, you are not talking about proving guilt at

11

trial. You are not talking about the government

12

distorting the adversary process.

13

distortion of the adversary process, it's with the

14

defendant attempting to commit perjury at that point.

15

The Sixth Amendment is different from the

means that that the statements cannot come in because it

24

statements in.

25

If there is any

And that means it's up to courts to balance the
And in the

But, when you switch over in looking at
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

impeachment, this Court said 50 years ago impeachment is

2

a very different story than the government's case in

3

chief. The interest that you are talking about

4

furthering there, the adversary process interest, would

5

not be furthered by allowing the defendant to take the

6

stand and be able to commit perjury unchecked. It would

7

not be furthered, and it would not lead to greater

8

deterrence by simply allowing the statements to be

9

unavailable for impeachment purposes, because the great

10

deterrent comes with the statements being unavailable in

11

the government's case in chief.

12

We just don't think there's any reason to

13

depart from this Court's rule that, so long as

14

statements are not involuntary, they can be used for

15

impeachment purposes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. EDGE

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22
23
24
25

MR. EDGE:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I guess I have basically three arguments
with the -- or problems with the State's position. First
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of all, what we are dealing with in the Sixth Amendment

2

case here is a violation of a core enumerated trial

3

right, and this makes it a very different animal from

4

all the other cases that we are talking about. If we are

5

talking about the Fourth Amendment, we are talking about

6

something that isn't a trial right. It's a right of the

7

people to be secure in their homes and possessions. The

8

violation occurs when the police commit whatever

9

misconduct makes the search of the evidence illegal. But

10

the use of that evidence at trial doesn't work any

11

further constitutional -

12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Wasn't this individual

represented by counsel? Was he represented by counsel?

14

MR. EDGE:

Yes, he was.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

And he was represented by

16

counsel at the time that the informant took the

17

statement, got the statement elicited? Is that right?

18

MR. EDGE:

No, I don't think so -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I have my memo that I

20

haven't looked through carefully, but I would be quite

21

interested. I thought he asked for counsel.

22

given counsel, and subsequent to that, this statement

23

was elicited. I would like to know that because the

24

Sixth Amendment says you have right to assistance of

25

counsel in your defense, period. And I guess, if he had
25
Alderson Reporting Company

He was

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a lawyer, the lawyer could have told him, "Don't talk to

2

informants in the jailhouse."

3

going to talk to who I want." Or he might not have. But

4

I would be interested in knowing, did he have assistance

5

of counsel at the time the statement was elicited?

6

one thing to me if he did, and another if he didn't.

7

Don't know?

8

MR. EDGE:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. EDGE:

He could have said, "I'm

It's

No.
How can I find out?

No, the -- I don't know exactly

11

the day that this happened. I do know that he was

12

arrested on the 16th of January of 2004, and there was a

13

search of his cell on January 20th. And we know from

14

that testimony that -- why that's relevant that he was

15

cellmates with Mr. Doser by that time, and Mr. Doser

16

testified that he was the cellmate of Mr. Ventris for

17

two days.

18

made these statements.

19

And on the second day, Mr. Ventris supposedly

So my best guess is that the -- this

20

conversation occurred sometime between the 17th and the

21

20th. Now, the order of appointing counsel was entered

22

on January 21st, and counsel doesn't enter his

23

appearance until January 27th.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

So it might be he asked for

counsel but hadn't yet received counsel?
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. EDGE:

Correct, Your Honor.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, do I

3

understand the first sentence on page 6 of your brief to

4

concede that there's no deterrent value from prohibiting

5

the introduction of these statements for impeachment?

6

The sentence says, "A Sixth Amendment exclusionary rule

7

that allowed use of uncounseled statements for

8

impeachment would not deter violations of the right to

9

counsel."

10

MR. EDGE:

That's correct, Your Honor. And

11

the reason I believe this is that, as long as there's

12

some kind of incentive for the prosecutor to use

13

informants in this manner, then the only -- then even if

14

they are not usable in the case in chief, there is still

15

an incentive to use this kind of evidence, and the

16

prosecutor and the police will attempt to obtain it.

17

There's simply very little downside. The prosecutor

18

instructs the informant not to deliberately elicit the

19

statement. The prosecutor is still responsible for the

20

informant, because the informant is his agent, so even

21

if -- when the informant goes ahead and deliberately

22

elicits the statement, it's still a constitutional

23

violation. But so long as you allow it for some kind of

24

purpose, then there isn't a deterrent effect, and to -

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

So in a situation like we
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have here, where the law enforcement officers do not

2

instruct the informant to do anything that would violate

3

the Sixth Amendment and in fact, according to their

4

testimony, instruct him to engage in conduct that is

5

consistent with the Sixth Amendment, there's no

6

deterrent value in later suppressing the use of the

7

statements for impeachment purposes?

8
9

MR. EDGE:

I mean

-- I guess, maybe I am

confused. There is a deterrent -- there is a deterrent

10

effect from suppressing it in the case in chief, but

11

it's not sufficient unless it's also extended to use in

12

rebuttal as well.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what do you want to

14

deter? You want to deter them from using informants at

15

all, even in a manner that is consistent with the Sixth

16

Amendment?

17

MR. EDGE:

No, Your Honor. What I am

18

attempting to deter is the sort of up-ending of the

19

adversarial system that this represents. There was a

20

question that was presented earlier about when does this

21

violation occur? And I think that gets to the manner of

22

-- or the nature of the Sixth Amendment violation. Our

23

contention is that the violation occurs when the

24

statement is extracted, and then it's further aggravated

25

when it's used at trial. When the police obtain these
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

kinds of statements, even if they are not used at trial,

2

it does work a harm on the defendant and his

3

relationship with counsel. It affects defendant's -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see the problem. I wonder

5

if you have an answer to another question. You may not.

6

I can't find it. It seems to me it's been 20 years since

7

this -- nearly 20 -- since the Court decided the

8

Michigan case. The other cases were decided even

9

earlier. And it's just surprising to me that it has

10

never come up or rarely, rarely come up that the

11

question of whether the State can introduce into

12

evidence a statement made when the State questioned an

13

individual who'd asked for counsel or had counsel out of

14

the presence of the counsel.

15

I mean, does that normally happen, or does

16

it never happen? Why is there so little law on it? Do

17

you have any idea?

18
19
20

MR. EDGE:

I do not, Your Honor. And I am

really at a loss to speculate as to why that would be.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You agree with the

21

representations on -- from your friends on the other

22

side that there is no case of ours where we have

23

excluded a statement of evidence submitted for

24

impeachment, even though it would have been excluded in

25

this case in chief?

If you prevail here, it would be
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the first time that any evidence or statement has been

2

excluded when submitted for purposes of impeachment?

3

MR. EDGE:

It would be a very different

4

rule.

I think the only rule that this would be the case

5

so far is in Portash, the self-incrimination clause.

6

are saying that the same type of rule should apply to

7

the Sixth Amendment.

8

whenever you are talking about the Fourth Amendment or

9

one of the prophylactic rules like Miranda or Jackson,

Otherwise, no, that's correct,

10

then they are admissible for impeachment purposes.

11

makes this case different is that it -- it involves a

12

violation of an enumerated Constitutional trial right.

13

We

JUSTICE BREYER:

What

That's what I'm not certain

14

about.

15

questions and what I can't figure out in my own mind is

16

this.

17

And this is why I ask -- have been asking these

I ask for a lawyer.

The State has some

18

period of time to give me a lawyer.

Now it's one thing

19

if what's going on is once I ask for a lawyer, the State

20

should deal with me through my lawyer; that's how they

21

are supposed to do it.

22

that's like a rule of ethics in most States in civil

23

context and other contexts -- that's not as basic as if

24

I ask for a lawyer and then the State just doesn't give

25

me one, though it should.

But that isn't as basic -

That's a different violation, a different

kind of violation.

incorporated in the Constitution.

complicating factors here, Your Honor, is that the State

helpful to me.

MR. EDGE:

I don't know whether he had asked

4

for a lawyer or not.

5

at the time, and one would be appointed for him.

6

otherwise-

7

I know that he was entitled to one

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

But we do know that

8

unlike the police giving Miranda warnings, there's no

9

warning here at all.

I mean, he thinks he is talking to

10

a cellmate.

Nobody tells him, "remember you've got a

11

right to be represented by counsel," and he's

12

essentially giving a statement without the Miranda

13

warnings.

14

MR. EDGE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the other side says

16

well, practically, the defendant is much more likely to

17

say something that's really involuntary when he is

18

confronting police officers, that the reason that we

19

exclude in the case of a police officer is this

20

intimidating setting, when the defendant is in the

21

police station or in the cell and there are these police

22

officers.

23

there isn't -- there isn't the coercive atmosphere that

24

there is when the police do the questioning.

25

Now he thinks he's just with a cellmate, so

MR. EDGE:

Well, Your Honor, I think that
32

Alderson Reporting Company

1

there certainly can be a coercive atmosphere even if you

2

are not talking to a known police agent.

3

not the facts of this particular case and there is no

4

claim that the statement was involuntary.

5

of the advantages of speaking to known police officers

6

is that a defendant can simply end the interrogation by

7

invoking his right to counsel, and that is not

8

necessarily a course of action that is available to him

9

if he thinks he is merely talking to a cellmate,

Now, those are

However, one

going to be in the cell with him for some time.

13

you've emphasized that what distinguishes this case from

14

the other ones where we have allowed evidence that would

purposes is that this is a trial right.

But -- but just like in the case of a Fourth

33

of that distinction.

itself to the trial.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it seems to me

you are getting away from the basis for your

10

distinction, then.

11

Well, these other constitutional rights where we have

12

allowed the evidence to come in for impeachment are

13

indistinguishable from the Sixth Amendment right,

14

outside of trial.

15

Saying well, it's not just at trial.

MR. EDGE:

Well, because the harm isn't

16

something that just affects the outcome of the trial, it

17

also affects the -- it affects the litigation in a much,

18

much deeper way.

19

it affects the defendant's decision whether or not to

20

testify.

21

It affects counsel's trial strategy,

It also CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Just to pause on

22

that, it affects his decision to testify because it

23

makes it more likely that he will testify truthfully if

24

he is going to testify.

MR. EDGE:

Not necessarily.
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The focus -- the

2

focus on the context is at least a double-edged sword

3

because the harm that we are facilitating under your

4

rule is to allow perjured testimony.

5

MR. EDGE:

Yes, Your Honor, in some contexts

6

it would.

I think one of the underlying assumptions of

7

the State's argument with regard to perjury is that the

8

mere existence of a prior inconsistent statement is

9

necessarily indicative of perjury, and we know there are

10

many reasons why the defendant may have given a prior

11

inconsistent statement.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, and if he has

13

the assistance at trial consistent with the Sixth

14

Amendment, those -- those problems could be pointed out.

15

He was -- he was he is not lying now.

16

said something different then was, you know, he likes to

17

brag in prison or whatever the basis is.

18

MR. EDGE:

The reason he

In some cases it will be possible

19

for counsel to vigorously cross-examine the informant.

20

In others it may not.

21

Honor, I would also say that it doesn't simply affect

22

the decision whether or not to go to trial or whether or

23

not to testify at trial; it also affects the litigation

24

in a very deep way, inasmuch as the defendant is

25

burdened in trying to negotiate a favorable plea deal.

But in addition to that, Your

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Every statement or every piece of evidence

2

that the State has affects their willingness to plea

3

bargain, and when the State obtains this kind of

4

evidence illegally, it puts the defendant in a bind for

5

-- puts the defendant's counsel in a bind.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think -- I think

7

that's quite right.

But I don't see how excluding the

8

evidence even on impeachment helps that.

9

they've still got the statement, and they -- I mean, you

I mean,

10

know -- I guess your point, you know, maybe they will

11

get some leads from it even if they can't use it.

12

excluding the evidence for impeachment purposes doesn't

13

eliminate that harm.

MR. EDGE:

But

It would, Your Honor, inasmuch it

15

would remove any disincentive for the police to obtain

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. McALLISTER:

Two points by way of

13

rebuttal.

14

sprinkling water under the bridge even in the Sixth

15

Amendment context.

16

Michigan versus Harvey where the Court was dealing with

17

Sixth Amendment interests and the Sixth Amendment right

18

to counsel violations, the bulk of those cases make

19

clear that the question of what exclusionary effect to

20

give a violation is subject to a balancing analysis.

21

And that's what we are asking for here.

22

treated for these purposes like the Fourth Amendment in

23

the Miranda context.

24
25

The balancing of the interests here is

In both Nix versus Williams and

That's why it's

And Nicks itself, to paraphrase the Court,
makes a fundamental point which I think illustrates how

this works, and it worked effectively to defendant's

2

advantage in this case.

3

In Nix v. Williams, the Court said the Sixth

4

Amendment right to counsel -- and I am paraphrasing

5

slightly -- protects against unfairness by assuring an

6

adversary process in which proffered evidence is tested

7

by cross-examination.

8

It is not about requiring the exclusion of entire

9

categories of witnesses or types of evidence for all

10

And it's done in front of a jury.

11

So the right to counsel was exercised.

It

12

was exercised effectively in this case when Mr. Doser

13

was strongly cross-examined by defense counsel.

14
15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would that apply equally

for statements under oath?

16

MR. McALLISTER:

It could, Your Honor.

I

realize a logical extension is you could say just test
