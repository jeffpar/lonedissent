ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. HARRISON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

In 1996 Congress provided in 8 U.S.C.

11

1252(b)(3)(B) that courts may stay an alien's order of

12

removal pending appeal.

13

whether Congress intended that temporary stays of

14

removal be governed by the normal standards applicable

15

to States or instead by the special standard that

16

Congress separately set forth for injunctions in

17

1252(f)(2).

18

normal stay standard should apply.

The question in this case is

There are three primary reasons why the

19

First, Congress used different words to

20

describe these different forms of relief, "stay" in

21

(b)(3)(B) and "enjoin" in (f)(2).

22

different words because it saw these forms of relief as

23

different.

24
25

Congress used

Second and related, a stay is in fact
different from an injunction.

It is a temporary vacatur

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of a court or vacancy order pending review.

2

directed at a party and does not order a party to take

3

action.

4

It is not

Third, even an alien with a strong

5

likelihood of success on the merits who will face

6

certain persecution if deported cannot get a stay under

7

the (f)(2) standard, a result Congress should not be

8

presumed to authorize in the absence of a clear

9

statement to that effect.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I'm not

11

sure this matters very much, But do you know if -- are

12

stays usually granted in this type of case?

13

type of case:

14

application to reopen.

15

Not this

A removal case as opposed to an

MS.

HARRISON:

In a removal case stays are

16

granted in eight circuits only if the individual meets

17

the traditional -

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, I understand

19

it.

I am just saying if you happen to know empirically

20

if most people who are facing removal get a stay.

21

MS. HARRISON:

I have seen no empirical -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

Did the government -- I

24

thought the government said that an empirical database

25

would be the Ninth Circuit, which has the more generous
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rule.

2

MS. HARRISON:

That's -

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My understanding is that

4

stays are granted in a very high percentage of those

5

cases.

6

the cases in which it's granted; and B, the percentage

7

of those cases that are ultimately decided in favor of

8

the government?

9

I would be curious to know, A, the percentage of

MS. HARRISON:

The data that I believe Your

10

Honor is referencing was the rate at which petitions for

11

review are filed, and not the rate at which stays are

12

granted or filed.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, is it true that

14

there are more petitions filed in the courts with the

15

more generous standards?

16

MS. HARRISON:

Again, I have not seen a

17

comprehensive study.

There are more petitions filed in

18

the Ninth Circuit, but there is no evidence of the cause

19

of that.

20

are in fact denied under the traditional standard,

21

because what that demonstrates is that the traditional

22

standard effectuates Congress's purpose of passing

23

IIRIRA and eliminating the automatic stay and making it

24

in fact more difficult for an individual to obtain a

25

stay on appeal.

And -- and I think it's important that stays

That -- the traditional standard does
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have real teeth and it does not result in an automatic

2

stay.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

the automatic stay eliminated?

5

current law come into effect?

6

MS. HARRISON:

How many years ago was
When did this -- the

At the same time in 1996.

7

Congress both eliminated the automatic stay, and it

8

replaced it with the language in 1252(b)(3)(B), which

9

indicates that a stay is not automatic unless a court

10

orders otherwise.

And -- now, that language was nearly

11

identical to the language that had previously existed,

12

where a stay was automatic except for aggravated felons.

13

For aggravated felons, the statute provided that a stay

14

was not automatic unless a court otherwise directs.

15

courts had interpreted that language to provide for

16

application of the traditional stay standards.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Is it possible in

18

this case to kind of split the baby?

19

appealing fact case than is typical, because yours

20

involves a denial of a motion to reopen and doesn't

21

really go to the ultimate merits.

22

I think do go to the ultimate merits, and it's easier to

23

see that (f)(2) may apply there as opposed to your case.

24

Now, is there a coherent way of saying that?

25

You have a more

Most of the petitions

In other words, in your type of case, you apply the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

traditional stay standards, but in a case where the

2

issue that is before the court is whether to order

3

removal or not on the merits, the other approach

4

applies.

5

MS. HARRISON:

I think that the way to do

6

that, Your Honor, is to apply (f)(2) where the alien is

7

seeking permanent relief.

8

seeking to enjoin his or her removal, the (f)(2)

9

standard makes a lot of sense, but the (f)(2) standard

10

And where the alien is

doesn't contain any predictive language.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It doesn't -

Well, but that's

12

just really saying the way that you avoid that is to say

13

you win across the board.

14

understanding is that in situations in which they are

15

going to be seeking an injunction to enjoin are quite

16

limited.

17

legal order.

18

I mean, it -- my

They are typically just seeking to vacate the

MS. HARRISON:

And if you then apply the

19

(f)(2) standard across the board to stay requests, then

20

what that would mean is that the court of appeals is

21

deciding the merits twice:

22

outset when determining whether or not the individual is

23

entitled to a stay; and then it's deciding it again when

24

the court decides whether the individual's entitled to

25

have the order of removal vacated.

It's deciding it at the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

And that just

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doesn't seem like what Congress had in -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I think I

3

understand that point when they're seeking to have the

4

order -- the removal order vacated.

5

seeking the reopening of the proceedings, which I guess

6

is a little different, isn't it, than the underlying

7

decision on the merits?

8
9

MS. HARRISON:

But here you are

Technically, the order of

removal is the order denying the motion to reopen, so

10

they are one and the same, in this case and in any case

11

where the petition for review is of an order of removal,

12

which is what the statute provides for.

13

that point is very important -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that right?

15

can that be?

16

then you move to reopen the proceedings.

17

two separate things?

18

And I think

How

I mean, you have an order of removal, and

MS. HARRISON:

Aren't they

Well, the statute provides

19

that an order denying a motion to reopen is itself an

20

order of removal, and that it's consolidated with the

21

original order of removal on appeal.

22

become one and the same case, and the order denying the

23

motion to reopen is the order of removal.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
that?
8
Alderson Reporting Company

So that they

Where does it say

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. HARRISON:

I do not believe that it is

2

in 1252 itself, and I don't have the citation for you.

3

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

MS. HARRISON:

Okay.

Back to the point that it's

6

important to recognize that the (f)(2) standard contains

7

no predictive language, it doesn't allow a court to say,

8

is this individual likely to succeed on the merits?

9

says can this individual show, by clear and convincing

It

10

evidence, that the entry or execution of the removal

11

order is prohibited by law, not likely to show, not we

12

are likely to find.

13

And so if courts were required to apply this

14

standard at the stay stage, they would be deciding the

15

very same question twice.

16

the merits question of whether the individual removal

17

order is prohibited by law and also the stay question of

18

whether it should be stayed pending -

19

They would be deciding both

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That wouldn't be deciding

20

it the same way twice.

Initially, they would just have

21

to decide whether -- whether the alien has shown by

22

clear and convincing evidence that he should win, and if

23

they decide no, he hasn't, then at the merits stage they

24

have to decide which one prevails by a preponderance of

25

the evidence.

So it's really a different call the
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

second time.
MS. HARRISON:

Well, Your Honor, the

3

government has stated in its brief that it believes

4

these two standards to be virtually identical.

5

the event that a stay was granted, it would certainly

6

render the merits decision superfluous because, if a

7

stay was granted and you could meet this higher burden,

8

then perforce you could meet the lower burden.

9
10
11
12
13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:
MS. HARRISON:

And in

That's true.
And so, in that situation,

(b)(3)(B) would be superfluous.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

What do you claim that

(f)(2) covers, if it doesn't cover these stays?
MS. HARRISON:

It covers any time an alien

15

seeks an injunction, now, both in the courts of appeals

16

and in a district court case.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MS. HARRISON:

How can that be?

Well, the Catholic Social

19

Services case is one example where individuals were

20

challenging the procedures whereby their legalization

21

applications were adjudicated under the Immigration

22

Reform and Control Act.

23

injunctive relief as a class to enjoin their removal

24

pending that case and permanently, in fact, because they

25

said they were entitled to legalization, which was an

And in that case, they sought

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

amnesty statute.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's -

3

that's kind of a systemic challenge, but you wouldn't

4

have a situation where you get an injunction in far more

5

typical individual cases, right?

6

MS. HARRISON:

Well, if an individual in

7

that case, Your Honor, attempted to enjoin his or her

8

removal, then the (f)(2) standard would certainly apply

9

to that individual.

And there's -- there's a reason why

10

an individual couldn't have brought that challenge as

11

opposed to a class.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why would he seek to enjoin

13

his removal when he is subject to a much lesser standard

14

when he just seeks to stay the removal?

15

have a bad lawyer or what?

16

MS. HARRISON:

I mean, does he

Well, in that case, it would

17

be in a district court, which doesn't have supervisory

18

authority over the court of appeals -- I'm sorry -

19

over the BIA's order.

20

presumably couldn't stay an order that it wasn't

21

reviewing.

And so the district court

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

court of appeals, is the next question.

24
25

MS. HARRISON:

Why wouldn't he go to the

Well, he perhaps might, but

if there was a delay in the procedure or if there was
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

some reason why -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

that is a flukey situation.

4

believe that (f)(2) was meant to address just that.

5

MS. HARRISON:

That's a fluke.

I mean,

And I find it hard to

Well, it would be in any

6

case, even in the court of appeals, where an individual

7

sought an injunction as opposed to a stay.

8

if it was a situation like the Singh case in the Ninth

9

Circuit, where there was a stay of removal in place, but

For example,

10

the agency was deporting the individual anyway.

11

the individual would need to obtain an injunction, and

12

in fact that was essentially what the Ninth Circuit

13

ordered, was a remand for the imposition of an

14

injunction against -

15
16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Also a fluke.

Then

We don't

expect the -- the executive to ignore a stay.

17

MS. HARRISON:

No, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think -

I think it's a fluke, too,

19

but you gave -- to my recollection, I forget where it

20

was -- I think you gave citations to three or four cases

21

in which that actually happened.

22

MS. HARRISON:

The Singh case, Your Honor,

23

is one of those cases.

There's also the Lindstrom case

24

from the Seventh Circuit.

25

either because of a miscommunication or some other

And it does happen that,

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason, that the stay is not effective, and in that case

2

an injunction would be.

3

And I think, in order to address the Court's

4

concern that (f)(2) is a fluke, it's important to take a

5

look at where it appears in the statute and its context.

6

Now, originally, the statute contained only (f)(1),

7

which says that you cannot obtain injunctions as a

8

class, but that individuals can obtain injunctions.

9

There was no (f)(2).

10

The bill went to conference and then

11

Congress added in (f)(2), I think to make very clear

12

that, although they had carved out this exception in

13

(f)(1) for individual cases, that it was not to be

14

granted as a matter of course, that even in particular

15

cases, which is the subtitle of (f)(2), the standard

16

should be very strict.

17

itself as closing a potential hole here, because it had

18

created this opportunity to obtain an injunction as an

19

individual without articulating a standard.

20

Congress went about articulating standard in (f)(2).

21

And it's a very high standard.

22

And so I think Congress saw

Then

Now, Congress did not cross-reference

23

(b)(3)(B), which is the stay provision, and in fact, in

24

the transitional rules, what Congress did was it only -

25

it only included a provision that was identical to
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(b)(3)(B).

2

transitional rules, which -- all of which demonstrate

3

that Congress did not see (f)(2) and (b)(3)(B) as

4

related; they saw them as separate with (f)(2) governing

5

injunctions and (b)(3)(B) governing stays.

6

It did not include (f)(2) in the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Maybe I'm missing

7

something but -- and, again, I don't know which way this

8

cuts, but the dispute strikes me as very academic as a

9

practical matter:

Judges looking at whether someone is

10

likely to prevail on the merits versus judges looking at

11

whether the person has shown by clear and convincing

12

evidence that he shouldn't be removed.

13

going to find one in one case, depending on the

14

standard, and the opposite in the same case I can't

15

visualize.

16

MS. HARRISON:

The judge that's

Well, the key I believe, Your

17

Honor, is the equities.

18

not permit consideration of the equities in determining

19

whether removal is prohibited by law.

20
21

Now, the (f)(2) standard does

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It doesn't?

You're

talking about equities or irreparable harm?

22

MS. HARRISON:

Both, Your Honor.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MS. HARRISON:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Both standards?

Yes.

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Same thing.

And you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cannot consider that at all under (f)(2)?

2

way in which the removal would be prohibited as a matter

3

of law under provisions that are concerned, for example,

4

about whether the person would be tortured or something

5

like that?

6

MS. HARRISON:

There's no

Well -- well, Your Honor,

7

under the (f)(2) standard, take, for example, someone

8

who had applied for asylum, and it was denied on a

9

procedural technicality, and the question is:

Was the

10

entry of the execution -- entry or execution of the

11

removal order prohibited by law?

12

That -- the issue of whether the

13

technicality was a -- was a correct finding or was not a

14

correct finding permits no consideration of whether or

15

not that individual, if they are deported, is going to

16

face persecution, torture, death, et cetera.

17

the -- the traditional -

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Only under

Because the

objection is on this procedural matter?

20

MS. HARRISON:

Correct.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if the objection

22

is that I am going to be tortured so you shouldn't order

23

my removal, he would be able to -- the court under

24

(f)(2) would be able to consider that, wouldn't it?

25

MS. HARRISON:

I don't believe so, Your
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Honor, unless the very question that was being decided

2

is whether the individual had met the -- met the

3

standard for relief under the Convention Against

4

Torture.

5

is seeking asylum, and there are questions about whether

6

-- whether the persecution is on the basis of a

7

protected class.

8
9

But there are also cases where an individual

Now, the question there is not whether or
not the person is likely to suffer irreparable harm if

10

they go back, but, rather, what is the basis on which

11

they may be entitled to asylum?

12

Bohegan -

13

And so the Court in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Don't they get to

14

pursue that even after they are sent back?

15

provisions that -- that their case does not abate just

16

because they have been removed?

17

MS. HARRISON:

There are

That is true, Your Honor.

18

However, their case may abate because they are killed,

19

they are put in jail, they are not in a position to come

20

back to this country.

21

the equities in this context is so critical and why

22

Congress would not have eliminated the equities from the

23

consideration without a very clear statement

24
25

And that is why consideration of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess that's

why -- I guess that goes back to my earlier question,
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which is, I see that if they are killed the case is

2

probably not in very good shape.

3

situations in which they are likely to face that sort of

4

difficulties upon removal it would seem to me are

5

situations where the removal would be prohibited by law.

6

MS. HARRISON:

But -- but the

Well, Your Honor, that was -

7

the court of appeals would only be allowed to consider

8

that if the question presented was whether they had

9

proven that they were likely to be killed if they were

10

returned to the country.

11

the question that the court of appeals is deciding.

12

But that often is not what -

It is deciding a procedural question.

It is

13

deciding whether the persecution was on the basis of a

14

protected class, those sorts of considerations, which

15

are not the same question as:

16

be killed if they are returned?

17

Is this person likely to

That's why -- that's why the -- this Court

18

has held that unless Congress demonstrates very clearly

19

that it intends to take away the court's ability to

20

consider the equities, that we don't interpret

21

Congress's -

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Excuse me, but I'm not

23

following.

I have the same difficulty that perhaps the

24

Chief Justice is trying to get at.

25

appears to the -- the judge that the -- that the alien
17
Alderson Reporting Company

In the case where it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would be murdered when he is returned, wouldn't his

2

deportation be prohibited by law?

3

MS. HARRISON:

Well, not always, Your Honor,

4

if the question that the court was considering wasn't

5

whether in fact the individual was going to be killed if

6

returned.

7

whether -- whether a crime he has committed subjects the

8

individual to deportation, then the fact that that

9

individual is going to be killed when he is returned to

If the question the court is considering is

10

the country is not part of the (f)(2) calculus.

11

And -- and I don't believe that the

12

government has -- has argued that the equities would be

13

part of the consideration.

14

that for legal -- for factual questions you need to

15

prove them by clear and convincing evidence, and for

16

legal questions you need to prove you are entitled to a

17

judgment as a matter of law.

18

The government has argued

Where the equities fall into that calculus

19

is -- is unclear, and I think they would only fall under

20

that calculus if the very question presented to the

21

court was that one.

say -

23

And -- and then, moreover, when you

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When you say "equities,"

24

is the fact that he has applied or his wife has applied

25

for adjustment of his status, is that an equity?
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. HARRISON:

No, Your Honor, I don't

2

believe that that itself would be an equity.

3

fact that he does have a wife and he does have a young

4

child in this country would be a permissible

5

consideration in the equitable analysis, in the analysis

6

of -- of irreparable harm that would come to him and his

family.

8

not the denial of adjustment -- of his adjustment of

status.

to emphasize this Court's clear-statement rule, which is

that the court doesn't take for -- lightly statutes that

1252(e)(1)(A), for example, which if you would like to

3

look appears on page 11a of the appendix to the gray

4

5

forms of equitable relief available to aliens facing

removal in expedited situations.

7

language was very clear that:

In that provision Congress said no court in

removal of an alien.

only used the word "enjoin" in its omission of other

equitable relief, and its omission of restrain are

instructive.

MS. HARRISON:

I don't believe that restrain

is, Your Honor, because I think restrain -- it's unclear

21

whether Congress is talking about a stay versus a

22

temporary injunction or a restraining order.

23

other equitable relief does capture stays, because we

24

don't deny that a stay is a form of equitable relief.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just to refresh my

4

recollection, what -- what is the major difference

between the standards that -- or the findings that the

6

judge must make, (a) to grant a preliminary injunction

7

and (b) to grant a stay?

8
9

MS. HARRISON:

That has to be the same, Your

Honor, in the usual situation, because both arise at the

10

same stage in the proceedings where it makes sense that

11

the court would want to consider:

likelihood that this person is going to succeed down the

13

road?

14

at this stage?

What is the

What -- what is the risk if I don't grant relief

But those two things are also treated

differently in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure

agency orders and not injunctions.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My -- my concern is that I

sense in this statute a congressional concern that stays

are too frequently granted.

if we were to accept your view of the statute, is to

say:

Well, the courts don't listen to that very

much.

And short of granting the -- accepting the

1

government's position, I don't know what you could do if

2

there were a -- a submission and understanding that

3

stays were being granted routinely and too frequently.

4

MS. HARRISON:

Well, Your Honor, the -- the

5

standard that Congress intended, the traditional one, is

6

not a standard under which stays are -- are routinely

7

granted.

8

very cases where the circuits decided whether (f)(2)

9

applies or -- or whether the traditional standard

10
11

They -- they have been denied in some of the

applies.
And this Court has given guidance, for

12

example, this term in Winter, that you have to -- not to

13

show some likelihood of -- of suffering or irreparable

14

harm, but you have to show a strong probability of

15

success on the merits, and you have to show a strong

16

probability of irreparable harm.

provide guidance to that effect.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

General Kneedler.

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
GEN. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The statutory text, context and background

8

of section 1252(f)(2) all demonstrate that that section

9

applies to orders granting a stay of removal pending a

10

court of appeals decision on a petition for review.

11

Indeed, if section 1252(f)(2) does not apply to such an

12

order barring removal, it is difficult to see what

13

function it would serve.

14

Now, Petitioner's counsel has suggested that

15

1252(f)(2) must be directed to what I think had been

16

referred to as fluke kind of district court orders, and

17

couldn't really be directed at the situation that we

18

have here. There are two very powerful responses to

19

that, if I may make them both.

20

The first is that subsection (f)(2), which

21

appear on page 14a of our brief refers, it says no court

22

shall enjoin the removal, et cetera, under this section,

23

meaning that the provision is specifically directed to

24

court orders that are entered as part of the proceedings

25

on judicial review of final orders under section 1252.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

It's not -- it's not principally directed at collateral

2

orders that might arise in some other class action or

3

some other sort of suit.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Were the examples that she

5

gives, the two or three cases, properly examples under

6

this section, in your -

7

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think there were two

8

different types of examples that she gave, if I may. I

9

think the first one was a situation where a Department

10

of Homeland Security officer might have erroneously

11

carried out an order of removal not realizing that there

12

was a -- a stay entered.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I interrupt you just a

14

second?

15

There were two or three cited cases.

16

When I meant examples, I meant the cited cases.

GEN. KNEEDLER:

The -- the cited cases, we

17

don't think, are examples of this. (F)(2) was not at

18

issue in those -- in those cases.

19

several of them was whether the separate provision

20

1252(g), which this Court discussed in the American-Arab

21

case, whether that applied, and there was at least one

22

other case, it involved the transitional rules under

23

which (f)(2) doesn't apply.

24
25

The question in

But I think the more fundamental answer to
your point was the second point that I was -- that I was
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going to make. There are -- there are three provisions

2

of section 1252 that make unmistakably clear that

3

Congress did not intend any challenge to a final order

4

of removal, any form of judicial review which would

5

include an injunction to take place outside of 1252

6

itself. And 1252(a)(1) provides the judicial review

7

shall be pursuant to chapter 158 of -- and that's on

8

page 1a of the brief -- shall be pursuant to chapter 158

9

of title 28, the Hobbs Judicial Review Act.

10

And then (a)(5), which is on page 4a of our

11

brief, says notwithstanding any other provision of law,

12

a petition for review filed with an appropriate court is

13

the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of the

14

removal order.

15

sentence the in that section says for purposes of this

16

entire chapter.

17

judicial review, it refers to any sort of statutory or

18

nonstatutory provision.

19

Unless there be any doubt, the last

Any time there is a reference to

So any time an alien would try to get an

20

injunction in any form of judicial review, Congress has

21

expressed barred it not only by this, but then also by

22

subsection (b)(9).

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

On that particular point,

24

just specifically -- this is awfully complicated and you

25

have had to go through it pretty quickly, and so have I.
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

All right.
So, it seems to me, looking at these three

3

sections, as soon as you get to (a)(2), it says certain

4

matter are not subject to judicial review, and it

5

includes 1225(b)(1), which I take it is the case where

6

somebody comes in, knocks at our door, and the

7

immigration judge says good-bye and he says, no, no, I

8

am entitled to be a refugee or asylum.

9

Now, we look at that, it says in there it's

10

subsection (e) gives you judicial review of that. Now we

11

look at the thing you cited which is (5) -- (a)(5), and

12

you read it completely correctly, but you left out these

13

words "except as provided in subsection (e)."

14

So now we go to subsection (e). And lo and

15

behold, what is subsection (e) talking about, but just

16

the case I have mentioned. It talks about -- it talks

17

about judicial review for orders under 1225(b)(1).

18

those are the people who knock at the door and they want

19

asylum. And there is some procedures for them.

20

Now,

So, now we look at (e) to see what are the

21

procedures for them.

And lo and behold, right there in

22

(2), it says you can have a habeas corpus procedure as

23

to certain matters, whether he is an alien, whether he

24

has been admitted as a refugee, et cetera. So it says

25

there are some you can have habeas corpus.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So I imagine a person who has been ordered

2

removed under (e). All right.

3

a habeas corpus and now the judge says good-bye. And

4

they go to a reviewing court, which is going to be a

5

habeas corpus court, and that court decides, the alien

6

is right, I am going to issue an injunction.

7

Now it says you can have

Now, just in case he's thinking that, in the

8

very next section (f), what we have are two provisions,

9

(f)(1) that says if his case is a case involving mass

10

action against the whole thing, you can't enter an

11

injunction.

12

And then we look at (2), and it says if his

13

is just a normal case, you can't enter an injunction

14

unless it meets this specific standard. So I looked at

15

that. And I admit this is pretty quick, and I thought

16

it's (e) and it's (f), and (f) is dealing with (e),

17

(f)(2). And it makes perfect sense. They don't want a

18

habeas corpus judge telling that immigration judge what

19

to do with the guy knocking on the door and saying "I

20

need asylum," unless they meet clear and present

21

danger -- clear and -- whatever it is, clear and

22

present -- yeah.

23

Okay.

Now, I will admit I read that

24

quickly. And therefore, I am probably missing something.

25

And I don't expect you necessarily to be an expert, but
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can you do your best to tell me what I am missing or if

2

you think I might be right?

3

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Yes, if I could.

1225(b)(1)

4

governs the special -- what is called expedited removal.

5

It's a special procedure, as you identified, for people

6

essentially knocking at the door, and it has very

7

limited review, as you suggested.

8

unreviewable except possibility of asylum.

9

Almost everything is

But it's -- that is the only provision for

10

district court review. It's the, shall we say,

11

functional equivalent of a petition for review in the

12

court of appeals and everybody else. Congress just

13

decided to have two different -- two separate

14

procedures, and I think for 1225(b)(1) it's really a

15

carryover orders of exclusion prior to 1996.

16
17
18

JUSTICE BREYER:

What it says here

specifically is it says habeas proceedings.
GEN. KNEEDLER:

Yes, it does -- it does

19

say -- it does say habeas, but (f) -- there is no

20

suggestion that (f), either (1), which is general

21

application, or (f)(2) in particular is limited to

22

subsection (e). It -- it speaks of any injunction.

23

And that is instructive because the term

24

"injunction" is used in the Hobbs Judicial Review Act to

25

describe an interlocutory order by a court of appeals on
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judicial review that suspends the enforcement of an

2

agency order pending judicial review.

3

Hobbs Judicial Review Act in our brief.

4

And we quote the

And as I mentioned before, that is very

5

important to understand here, because Congress

6

provided -- other than the habeas review for this

7

special category, Justice Breyer, Congress provided that

8

judicial review in the norm is in the court of appeals

9

pursuant to the Hobbs Act. And if you look at the Hobbs

10

Act provision for interlocutory stays, it refers to

11

interlocutory relief as an injunction.

12

word -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

It uses the

Well, let me add one other

14

thing, because all I am trying to do is find some work

15

for this section (f)(2) to do.

16

some.

17

agree it's like habeas.

18

like an exclusion order rather than a removal order.

19

And I think I found

And I think what you say is wait a minute, we
But and I think it would be

And I did notice previously when it talks

20

about 1225, sometimes it uses the word "exclusion" and

21

sometimes it says "removal." But if you were that

22

district habeas judge and you get a thing saying

23

removal, you don't really vacate it.

24

had do is order an injunction against its enforcement.

25

Here I don't know 30
Alderson Reporting Company

I think what you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

GEN. KNEEDLER:

I think the habeas court

2

would have the authority -- would have the authority to

3

vacate just as -- just as a court of appeals would have

4

the authority to vacate.

5

But my basic point is that both of them are

6

forms of judicial review.

And if this heightened

7

injunction standard applies to the form of judicial

8

review that Congress has decided to leave in habeas,

9

then there is no reason to imagine why Congress wouldn't

10

want the same injunctive standard to apply to somebody

11

who is seeking judicial review in the normal way, in the

12

court of appeals, especially since Congress used the

13

word "injunction" to describe this very sort of

14

interlocutory relief under the Hobbs Judicial Review Act

15

when -- when a person seeks judicial review in a -- in a

16

court of appeals.

17

And this conforms to the ordinary meaning of

18

the word which is "enjoin," which is to prohibited

19

something, to require a party to abstain from carrying

20

out an act. That's exactly what a stay of removal does.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you -- do you

22

agree with your friend that the basic difference between

23

your two positions is that under the stay factors you

24

are allowed to consider irreparable harm but are not

25

allowed to consider that under (f)(2).
31
Alderson Reporting Company

GEN. KNEEDLER:

No, I think (f)(2) -- (f)(2)

It's -- it's a condition -

19

without the clear and convincing standard, he loses.

nothing for irreparable harm considerations to -- to add

Well, as we understand the

reference to clear and convincing evidence, and

25

admittedly it's not entirely clear how Congress intended
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that standard to apply in this context.

2

understand it it is -- it is a standard of review

3

slightly more favorable to the alien than the

4

substantial evidence review standard, which is what

5

would apply -- one final -

6
7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's certainly more than a

preponderance?

8
9

As we

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

But -- but in no

event, even on review of the final order, is the court

10

reviewing for a preponderance of the evidence; the court

11

is reviewing the case on the administrative record under

12

the substantial evidence test, in which case the court

13

at final judgment cannot set aside the -- the agency

14

order, except -- unless it finds that no reasonable

15

factfinder could conclude that the order should stand.

16

That's the substantial evidence test.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the ultimate -- the

18

ultimate standard to which they look is a preponderance

19

standard.

20

standard is keyed to what a reasonable factfinder could

21

find reasonably, based upon substantial evidence.

22

the substantial evidence sufficient for such a

23

factfinder to find by a preponderance that this person

24

has failed to meet, or, put it the other way around,

25

that the factfinder has unreasonably failed to find that

In other words, the substantial evidence

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Petitioner has met the standard?

2

So ultimately you are talking about a

3

preponderance standard, which is -- which is the key,

4

isn't that correct?

5

GEN. KNEEDLER:

That -- that is -- the court

6

-- you are correct in the sense that the court is

7

reviewing to see whether substantial evidence supports

8

the IJ's determination by a preponderance of the

9

evidence.

But (f)(2) is written in terms of the sort of

10

showing that the alien must make to the court, and -

11

and not -- not what he would have made to the IJ.

12

as -- and as we read it, as we try to apply the language

13

in the context of a stay, we thing that means that the

14

alien must show something a little bit short of -- of

15

the substantial evidence, that no reasonable factfinder

16

could find it, at least clear and convincing evidence

17

that as -- that the IJ was incorrect or that the alien

18

has a successful case.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Are there other cases in

20

which clear and convincing -- the clear and convincing

21

standard applies to appellate courts?

22

clear and convincing is more appropriate for a factual

23

determination at the trial court level.

24
25

GEN. KNEEDLER:
is.

It seems to me

It -- it -- it ordinarily

And that --and that's why the phrasing, as I was
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

trying to discuss with Justice Souter, I think, is a

2

little awkward.

3

and this may be what Congress was really driving at,

4

when it was -- when it was saying clear and convincing

5

evidence, it really meant a clear and convincing

6

showing; that the -- that the courts shouldn't take this

7

too casually.

8
9

Another possible way to think about it,

As we point out in our brief, the Second
Circuit has a standard that the alien just has to show

10

more than a negligible likelihood of success on the

11

merits to prevail.

12

even the traditional standard would be.

13

possible to read clear and convincing evidence as really

14

driving at clear and convincing showing, which is

15

language that is -- that is somewhat reminiscent of what

16

this Court has said for preliminary injunctions

17

generally.

18

Well, that -- that's way below what

3

GEN. KNEEDLER:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

And there are others.
And it seems to me that

5

would make it impossible for the district judge to do,

6

because the district judge cannot honestly say that it's

7

clear and convincing that this man is going to win.

8

he knows is he has a point and he would like to hear

9

more about it and he doesn't want him on the airplane

10

three hours from now from Hong Kong.

11

it supposed to work?

12
13

GEN. KNEEDLER:

All

So I -- so how is

Well, it would be the court

of appeals, not the district judge.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Right.
But it -- we believe that

16

that -- that 1252(f)(2) allows a court to take the time

17

necessary to rule meaningfully on the stay application.

18

We do not believe Congress intended to divest the court

19

of the ability to rule on the merits.

20

substantive standard that the alien has to make a clear

21

and convincing -- has to show by clear and convincing

22

evidence.

23

showing; therefore it presupposes that the court must be

24

able to evaluate that showing.

25

presupposes that the government is permitted to respond

It has a

It presupposes that the alien has to make a

We also believe that it

37

to it.

2

So we -- we do not object and have not

3

objected in the lower courts to the courts taking

4

sufficient time to -- to freeze the status quo by

5

issuing a short stay if necessary to do that.

6

Now, in the Eleventh Circuit, for example,

7

which has operated under this heightened showing for

8

some period of time, it tends to work out, because when

9

a -- a -- a petition for review and stay application is

10

granted, the court contacts the Office of Immigration

11

Litigation which works with DHS to inform the court on

12

how soon the order might be issued, and then the court's

13

aware of how quickly it might act.

14

So -- so it wouldn't often be necessary for

15

the court to do it, but we did not challenge that

16

authority.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But and -- and I applaud

18

the fact that you don't, but I don't know how you can do

19

it consistently with your view that "stay" in (b)(3)(B)

20

means the same thing as the "injunction" in (f) when

21

"injunction" in (f) is restricted as much as it is.

22

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

God bless you, but I don't

24

know how -- I don't know how under the statute, on your

25

reading of the statute, you -- you can do it.

GEN. KNEEDLER:

There are two responses.

2

One, we -- we think it is necessarily implicit in the

3

statutory framework that Congress would have wanted the

4

court to be able to rule on the interlocutory

5

injunction, but the -- but the second point I think that

6

-- that reinforces this proposition, again, if you go

7

back to the Hobbs Judicial Review Act, it has a

8

provision not only for interlocutory injunctions, which

9

is what we're really talking about here, but a provision

10

for a temporary -- for a court to issue a temporary stay

11

upon a showing of irreparable injury to allow the status

12

quo to be maintained pending the court's ruling on the

13

interlocutory injunction.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

Then why

15

doesn't that provide the broader authority under

16

(b)(3)(B) stay provision that your friends on the other

17

side are arguing for?

18

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Well, it may -- that may

19

well be the right answer, is to read (b)(3)(B) -

20

(b)(3)(B)'s opening that -- which says a petition for

21

review does not in itself stay the order -- is very

22

similar to the language in the opening of 2349(b) which

23

is the interlocutory injunctive language of the Hobbs

24

Judicial Review Act.

25

petition doesn't stay or suspend the order.

It says the mere filing of the

39
Alderson Reporting Company

It says

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

stay or suspend the order, and it says stay, and then it

2

says but a court may -- I forget the precise language -

3

restrain or suspend the order reflecting pending

4

judicial review; and it refers to that as an

5

interlocutory injunction.

6

But it says if the Petitioner shows that

7

irreparable injury would occur before the court has a

8

chance to rule even on the interlocutory injunction, it

9

can issue what's called a temporary stay to maintain the

10

status quo until it can look at the -- at the -- at the

11

interim relief.

12

Well, if -- if that -- if that background

13

rule is not misplaced, that would allow for some

14

separation of the sort of emergency motion for a stay, a

15

hold fast sort of situation, for the court to be able to

16

evaluate the merits.

17

Act refers to as an injunction, then (f)(2) kicks in,

18

interlocutory injunction pending -- pending judicial

19

review.

20

But when it gets to what the Hobbs

So that would be -- that would be an

21

underlying statutory basis for allowing the court to -

22

to issue a temporary order to allow the -- to allow the

23

proceeding to go forward, but we think it should be done

24

in a timely way.

25

contemplates a rather casual, up to 60 days that such a

The Hobbs Judicial Review Act

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

temporary stay should remain in effect.

We think in

2

many cases under the immigration laws the court should

3

be able to act on the stay application more quickly than

4

that.

5

I did want -- I did also want to stress the

6

-- the policy purposes that Justice Kennedy raised in -

7

in an earlier question, and that is the -- the thrust

8

the whole thrust of the 1996 amendments to the

9

Immigration Act was to expedite the removal of aliens,

10

particularly criminal aliens, but not all -- but all

11

aliens in fact.

12

did that.

13

said the mere filing of petition for review

14

automatically stayed the removal unless the courts

15

ordered -- ordered otherwise.

16

prior provision that said that the alien -- if the alien

17

left the country, including -- that was construed to

18

mean pursuant to deportation order, he could no longer

19

challenge the removal order outside the country.

20

And Congress did several things when it

It repealed the prior provision where that

And it also repealed the

Congress changed completely that and it said

21

you had can now challenge the order of removal from

22

outside the country, and it basically reversed the

23

presumption with respect to whether - whether the filing

24

of the petition for review stays -- stays the order of

25

removal.

Congress said, No, it does not unless the
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

courts ordered otherwise.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you would expect the

3

standard to be in the (b)(3)(B) provision.

It says that

4

no automatic stay unless the court otherwise orders,

5

period.

That's the end of it.

6

So one wonders whether this would think that

7

the normal standard for a stay would apply.

And then

8

(f)(2) is separated by several pages and (f)(1) is

9

dealing with something where we understand it.

It says

10

no mass injunctions against the enforcement of a

11

provision.

12

to, is it supposed to have some relationship to (1)?

13

says you can't enjoin the enforcement of a provision of

14

the law.

15

But (2) is really puzzling what it relates

GEN. KNEEDLER:

1

Well, (f)(1) is directed at

16

-- in large part at programmatic challenges.

17

provides -- it prohibits courts from enjoining or

18

restraining the operation of part 4 of the INA which -

19

which is the provision that deals with deportation,

20

adjudication of deportation and exclusions and carrying

21

out those orders, which by the way we think is the

22

reason it says enjoin or restrain, because it's talking

23

about programmatic type actions, and restrain -- the

24

word restraint is sometimes used to be something in an

25

absolute prohibition, just -- just to limit it, whereas
42
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on "enjoin" is necessary under (f)(2) because it -

2

because what is being enjoined or stayed is a vary

3

discreet act.

4

removal or -- or you don't.

You can have an injunction barring

5

But I -- I think a further answer to your

6

question, Justice Ginsburg, is that (f)(2) says under

7

this section, which means that it is obviously referring

8

to court orders entered in the course of -- of removal

9

proceedings under section 1252, and when a court finally

10

gets to the merits in a petition for review in a court

11

of appeals, the court if it decides that there is a flaw

12

-- excuse me -- a legal flaw in the BIA or immigration

13

judge's decision, it vacates the decision and -- and -

14

and remands.

15
16
17

Injunctions are not necessary in that -- in
that kind of review, so
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So in this -- in

18

this case involving a denial of a motion to reopen, what

19

the court of appeals is supposed to do is to look ahead

20

and see if this person has shown by clear and convincing

21

evidence that they shouldn't be removed; and if they

22

haven't, then their -- their removal can't be blocked,

23

even for example if the court of appeals thinks, well,

24

yes, they should have gotten their motion to reopen.

25

GEN. KNEEDLER:

No, no.
43

Alderson Reporting Company

The way -- the way

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I would understand it to operate is that the -- the

2

alien would have to make a clear and convincing showing

3

that he is entitled to have the motion to reopen

4

granted.

5

that vacates the final order of removal and therefore

6

there is no longer a final order of removal pursuant to

7

which the alien could be removed.

8
9

Because if the motion to reopen is granted,

And I did want to respond to your suggestion
that maybe the standard should be more lenient with

10

respect to motions to reopen.

11

that's the opposite of what the rule should be, if

12

anything; because the final -- the review of the final

13

order of removal is the main show; and in that -- in

14

that situation, the alien is actually challenging the

15

order of removal.

16

With respect, I think

In a case like this where the order of

17

removal was a long time ago, and the -- and the -- the

18

alien sought judicial review of that and that was

19

denied, the only thing before the court is the -- is the

20

motion to reopen.

21

staying the denial of a motion to reopen is meaningless.

22

In order to get the relief preventing removal you need a

23

stay of removal, which really effectively directs DHS

24

as we think it does in all cases -- directs DHS not to

25

execute the order of removal that was -- t hat was

And staying -- a judicial order

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

already previously entered.

2

And also the denial of a motion to reopen,

3

especially like the one at issue in this case, where the

4

question is whether the alien has shown -- has produced

5

material evidence of changed circumstances, that is

6

reviewed as this Court said in its decision in Abudu,

7

under an abuse of discretion standard.

8

very likely -- very unlike that an alien would prevail.

9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

This provision

applies to us as well, I take it, right?

11
12

So it would be

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Yes, we -- we believe it

would.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if there is a

14

cert petition filed on behalf of an alien subject to

15

removal, and he asks for a stay of removal, we have to

16

decide whether he meets the clear and convincing

17

evidence standard.

18
19
20

GEN. KNEEDLER:

For -- for purposes of

granting a stay, yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We should have -- we

21

should have done this in this case, but I assume you

22

suspended removal of the Petitioner on your own?

23

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Well, the Court granted the

stay in connection with the -- with the granting of -

25

of certiorari in my case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask just a

technical point?

Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One of the -- the motion

5

to reopen was based on changed circumstances in the

6

Cameroon.

7

application for adjustment of his status, which was

8

turned down because it was a successive motion.

9

But there was also this independent

GEN. KNEEDLER:

10

Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

My understanding is that

11

that adjustment could not have been asked for earlier

12

because his wife didn't come with -- until after.

13

GEN. KNEEDLER:

If I -- yes.

Well, he -- he

14

did seek -- he did seek, the first time around he sought

15

a remand for consideration of his adjustment of status

16

application, but one of the requirements to be eligible

17

for that is that a visa be available, and a visa was not

18

then available, and nothing in the Act requires that

19

deportation hearings be held up until a visa becomes

20

available.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but now he would

qualify, except that it's a successive motion.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MS. HARRISON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

I'd like to start with the point that the

17

government contends that this Court or any court of

18

appeals could impose a stay to consider the stay motion.

19

And, respectfully, I don't believe that is consistent

20

with the text of (f)(2), and I think that the fact that

21

the government must stray from the text is a sign of how

22

absurd the results would be if (f)(2) were applied to

23

stays.

24
25

Now, the reason they must stray from the
text is that the text says "notwithstanding any other
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

provision of law," which means notwithstanding the Hobbs

2

Act and notwithstanding the All Risk Act, which is where

3

I believe my brother was indicating this Court would get

4

authority to impose such a stay.

5

Now, I think the fact that there are cases

6

where such a need would arise, as in Justice Breyer's

7

hypothetical, is exactly why this Court applies a

8

presumption against interpreting statutes as restricting

9

the equitable authority of the courts, unless there is a

10

clear statement to the contrary, which -

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, but you still have a

12

differential on the Friday to Monday night hypothetical.

13

You wouldn't apply, or would you, the same standard that

14

you would apply on Monday for the next -- on Monday for

15

the next year and a half?

16

MS. HARRISON:

17

Well, Your Honor, the (f)(2)

--

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because you have the same

19

problem under your standard as the government does under

20

its.

21

MS. HARRISON:

Well, that's true.

You'd

22

have to show likelihood of success.

23

situation where you could consider the equities, if the

24

equities were strong enough and demonstrated in the stay

25

application, then it wouldn't be difficult for the court
50
Alderson Reporting Company

But in -- in the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to decide whether the balance of the factors justified

2

implementing a stay in that situation.

3

the court would have to decide the question outright.

4

And, again, (f)(2) does not mean any predictive

5

language; it just says, has the individual demonstrated

6

and shown by clear and convincing evidence that removal

7

is prohibited by law?

8

there is a -- the court is allowed to consider whether

9

the individual is likely to show success on the merits.

10

Under (f)(2),

Under the traditional standard,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You think that if you do

11

not prevail, and we say clear and convincing evidence is

12

the standard, that courts are not entitled to consider

13

equity?

14

MS. HARRISON:

Well, Your Honor, I heard my

15

brother as indicating that if you meet the (f)(2)

16

standard, then -- then the court can consider the

17

equities so as to deprive the individual of the stay,

18

but that if you cannot meet the (f)(2) standard, then

19

the question is closed and there is no consideration.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

About your position, is it

21

your contention that if we grant -- if we determine

22

clear and convincing is the standard, that equities are

23

not relevant to that calculus?

24
25

MS. HARRISON:

Yes, Your Honor, in the event

that the individual does not meet (f)(2).
51
Alderson Reporting Company

If the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

individual meets (f)(2), then I do believe the court

2

would go on to consider the equities.

3

that the individual has met the (f)(2) standard, the

4

court could simply grant the petition on the merits, and

5

there is no need to go about considering the equities

6

because the individual has shown that -- by clear and

7

convincing evidence -- that removal is prohibited as a

8

matter of law.

But in the event

9

And that is the second point I want to get

10

to, which is Your Honor's question about, isn't this a

11

standard that sounds a lot more like it is directed at

12

district courts because -- I think you are right, Your

13

Honor, and I think it does sound like that standard

14

because I so think that was where it was intended to

15

apply.

16

modify the word "enjoin"; it modifies the word "final

17

order of removal."

18

reading to it would require you to move that phrase from

19

where Congress placed it in the statute, to after the

20

word "enjoin."

21

And the phrase "under this section" does not

And to ascribe the government's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess General

22

Kneedler's point is that clear and convincing shifts a

23

little, depending on how long you've got to look at it.

24

If you've only got a day or a few hours before the

25

removal is going to take place, you can say this is
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

convincing enough based on what I have had a chance to

2

look at.

3

what may be called the temporary stay to get more

4

briefing from the government or whatever.

5

find out when you look at it a little more deeply that

6

it's not clear and convincing.

7

But -- and therefore you could enter, I guess,

MS. HARRISON:

But you may

What's wrong with that?

Well, Your Honor, if the

8

Court were to interpret clear and convincing as a more

9

flexible standard, then I don't think -- you know, I

10

don't disagree with Your Honor's characterization of it.

11

But I still think that, regardless of how you interpret

12

clear and convincing, that the equities would not be

13

part of the calculus.

14

And I also think that the fact that clear

15

and convincing sounds like a standard Congress would

16

have addressed to district courts, the fact that (f)(2)

17

says "no" courts, not -- not just the "courts of

18

appeals," the fact that it references an "alien" and not

19

a "petitioner" are -- and the fact that it is addressed

20

to instances where the entry or execution is prohibited

21

by law as opposed to the order itself being unlawful are

22

all signs that Congress intended this provision to apply

23

both in the district courts and in the court of appeals.

24
25

And I would also note that (a)(5), which is
a provision the government pointed to, was not in the
53

23

in the '96 IIRIRA statute.

24

would apply, would have real impact.

25

I believe

And

And in those cases, (f)(2)

And I would also note that if the Court were

1

to accept the government's interpretation of the term

2

"enjoin," that it only applies in stays and that doesn't

3

have application elsewhere, then you would be required

4

to interpret Congress's use of the word "enjoin" to be

5

not really inclusive of stays but as coterminous with

6

the word "stay."

7

"stay" it (f)(2).

8

fact that that word choice was different from the word

9

it used in (b)(3)(B) I think is a clear indication that

But Congress didn't use the word
It used the word "enjoin."

And the

10

Congress had something different.

11

cross-reference stay and didn't use the word "stays,"

12

and it articulated a standard that seems more

13

appropriate for district courts adjudicating permanent

14

injunctive relief than courts of appeals hearing a

15

temporary application for a stay.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It didn't

But the standard you

17

think should apply under (b)(3)(B) is a standard that

18

describes as applicable to temporary injunctions.

19

word -- there is substantial likelihood of success on

20

the merits and irreparable harm -- that is the standard

21

preliminary injunction, not preliminary stay.

22

preliminary injunction standard.

23

certainly overlap.

24

MS. HARRISON:

The

The

So the two words

Yes, Your Honor.

There is

overlap, and the standard that is applied by the courts,

1

if there is no statute to the contrary, is the same.

2

But here Congress expressed an intention to treat

3

injunctive relief differently and articulated a standard

4

that was higher than injunctive relief.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just ask this one

6

real quick:

7

that the government's interpretation of the statute that

8

our stay in this case violated the statute?

9

MS. HARRISON:

10
11

Do you understand -- is your understanding

Yes, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, Ms.

Harrison.

12

General Kneedler, Ms. Harrison, the Court

13

entered a very expedited briefing and arguments schedule

14

in this case that unfortunately fell over the holiday

15

season, and we appreciate very much that this must have

16

imposed a burden on you had and your colleagues.

17

you.

Thank

18

The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the case in the

20

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
