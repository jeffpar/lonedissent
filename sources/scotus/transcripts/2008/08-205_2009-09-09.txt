CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

v. The Federal Election Commission.

Mr. Olson.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

9
10
11

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Robust debate about candidates for elective

12

office is the most fundamental value protected by the

13

First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.

14

precisely the dialogue that the government has

15

prohibited if practiced by unions or corporations, any

16

union or any corporation.

17

Yet that is

The government claims it may do so based

18

upon the Austin decision that corporate speech is by its

19

nature corrosive and distorting because it might not

20

reflected actual public support for the views expressed

21

by the corporation.

22

radical concept of requiring public support for the

23

speech before you can speak would even authorize it to

24

criminalize books and signs.

25

The government admits that that

This Court needs no reminding that the
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government when it is acting to prohibit, particularly

2

when it is acting to criminalize, speech that is at the

3

very core of the First Amendment has a heavy burden to

4

prove that there is a compelling governmental interest

5

that -- that justifies that prohibition and that the

6

regulation adopted, in this case a criminal statute, is

7

the most narrowly tailored necessary to accomplish that

8

compelling governmental interest.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Olson, are you taking

10

the position that there is no difference in the First

11

Amendment rights of an individual?

12

all, is not endowed by its creator with inalienable

13

rights.

14

draw between corporations and natural human beings for

15

purposes of campaign finance?

16

A corporation, after

So is there any distinction that Congress could

MR. OLSON:

What the Court has said in the

17

First Amendment context, New York Times v. Sullivan,

18

Rose Jean v. Associated Press, and over and over again,

19

is that corporations are persons entitled to protection

20

under the First Amendment.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. OLSON:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would that include -

Now, Justice Would that include

24

today's mega-corporations, where many of the investors

25

may be foreign individuals or entities?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. OLSON:

The Court in the past has made

2

no distinction based upon the nature of the entity that

3

might own a share of a corporation.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

MR. OLSON:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Own many shares?

Pardon?
Nowadays there are

7

foreign interests, even foreign governments, that own

8

not one share but a goodly number of shares.

9

MR. OLSON:

I submit that the Court's

10

decisions in connection with the First Amendment and

11

corporations have in the past made no such distinction.

12

However -

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could they in your view,

14

in the view that you are putting forth, that there is no

15

distinction between an individual and a corporation for

16

First Amendment purposes, then any mega-corporation,

17

even -- even if most of the investors are from abroad,

18

Congress could not limit their spending?

19

MR. OLSON:

I'm not -- I'm not saying that,

20

Justice Ginsburg.

I'm saying that the First Amendment

21

applies.

22

Congress and the government has established a compelling

23

governmental interest and a narrowly tailored remedy to

24

that interest.

25

record of that in this case of which I am aware.

Then the next step is to determine whether

If the Congress -- and there is no

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Certainly the government has not advanced it in its

2

briefs:

3

interest because of foreign investment in corporations.

4

If there was, then the Court would look at,

5

determine how serious is that interest, how destructive

6

has it been to the process and whether the -- maybe the

7

limitation would have something to do with the ownership

8

of shares of a corporation or some -

9

That there is some compelling governmental

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think Congress could

10

prevent foreign individuals from funding speech in

11

United States elections?

12

MR. OLSON:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Private individuals,

foreigners who -- who want to -

15
16

The -- the -

MR. OLSON:
question.

17

That's, of course, a different

I haven't studied it, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's not different.

18

I asked it because I thought it was related to the

19

question you were answering.

20

MR. OLSON:

The fundamental point here is -

21

and let me start with this, and I think we should -- we

22

should start with this, and the government hardly

23

mentions this.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Before you do, Mr. Olson

-6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. OLSON:

2

Amendment, "Congress shall make" -

3

The language of the First

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Olson -- Mr. Olson,

4

would you answer Justice Ginsburg's question yes or no?

5

Can the -- leaving aside foreign investors, can the -

6

can -- does the First Amendment permit any distinction

7

between corporate speakers and individual speakers?

8
9

MR. OLSON:
case that just -

10
11

I am not -- I'm not aware of a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I am not asking you that.

I meant in your view does it permit that distinction?

12

MR. OLSON:

My view is based upon the

13

decisions of this Court and my view would be that unless

14

there is a compelling governmental interest and a

15

narrowly -

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if there is a

17

compelling government -- can there be any case in which

18

there is a different treatment of corporations and

19

individuals in your judgment?

20

MR. OLSON:

I would not rule that out,

21

Justice Stevens.

22

all of the infinite varieties of potential problems that

23

might exist, but -- but we would eventually come back to

24

the narrow tailoring problem anyway.

25

I mean, there may be.

I can't imagine

What the government has done here is
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prohibit speech.

2

in this country, but there are something like 6 million

3

corporations that filed tax returns in 2006.

4

I don't know how many unions there are

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Olson, do you

5

think that media corporations that are owned or

6

principally owned by foreign shareholders have less

7

First Amendment rights than other media corporations in

8

the United States?

9

MR. OLSON:

I don't think so, Justice Alito,

10

and certainly there is no record to suggest that there

11

is any kind of problem based upon that.

And I come back

12

to the language of the First Amendment:

"Congress shall

13

make no law."

14

is that there may be laws inhibiting speech if there is

15

a compelling governmental interest and a narrowly

16

tailored remedy.

17

this.

Now, what this Court has repeatedly said

But there is no justification for

18

I was going to say that 97 percent of the 6

19

million corporations that filed tax returns in 2006 had

20

assets less than $5 million -- assets, not net worth.

21

So we are talking about a prohibition that covers every

22

corporation in the United States, including nonprofit

23

corporations, limited liability corporations, Subchapter

24

S corporations and every union in the United States.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what are the -- you

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have used the word "prohibition," Mr. Olson.

2

to that is that no entity is being prohibited, that it

3

is a question of not whether corporations can contribute

4

but how.

5

the people who contribute are really supportive of the

6

issue, of the candidate.

7
8
9

One answer

They can use PACs and that way we assure that

But so the -- the corporation can give, but
it has to use a PAC.
MR. OLSON:

I respectfully disagree.

The

10

corporation may not expend money.

11

stockholders or officers, who wanted to contribute to a

12

separate fund, who could then speak.

13

use the words of one Justice, that is

14

ventriloquist-speak.

15

surrogate speech.

16

that will say what you want to say and get them to

17

contribute money through a process that this just -

18

It might find people,

That in one -- to

I would say that it is more like

If you can find some other people

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Who is the "you"?

I mean

19

do you -- you -- those are the directors, the CEO, not

20

the shareholders?

21

We don't know what they think.

MR. OLSON:

Well, this statute is not

22

limited to cases where the shareholders agree or don't

23

agree with what the corporation says.

24

in the Bellotti case, the prohibition would exist

25

whether or not the shareholders agree.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

As the Court said

But let me go

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3

back to your question.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

totally owned corporations, too, doesn't it?

4

MR. OLSON:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6
7
8
9

It -- it covers totally -

Yes.
I mean, if I owned all the

stock in a corporation, the corporation still can't MR. OLSON:

Yes.

And it includes membership

corporations such as Citizens United that JUSTICE BREYER:

And the individual

10

contribution also covers people who would like to give

11

$2500 instead of $2400, which is the limit.

12

there are 100 million or 200 million people in the

13

United States who, if they gave 2500 rather than 2400,

14

nobody could say that that was really an effort to buy

15

the Senator or the Congressman.

16

unconstitutional, too?

17

MR. OLSON:

And maybe

So is that

No -- well, what this Court has

18

said is that in connection with contribution limitations

19

there is a potential compelling governmental interest.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. OLSON:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

This is what Buckley says.
Yes.

Then that -- in that -- but

24

expenditures, which is what we are talking about today,

25

do not concern the -- the question, the actual threat of
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of quid pro

2

quo corruption.

3

Court said in that case is because it's not inhibiting

4

someone from actually speaking, it's -- it's giving

5

money to someone -

6

And you know, Justice Breyer, what the

JUSTICE BREYER:

So here the obvious

7

argument is:

Look, they said the compelling interest is

8

that people think that representatives are being bought,

9

okay?

That's to put it in a caricature, but you

10

understand what I'm driving at, okay?

11

said in Buckley v. Valeo.

12

precisely that interest leads us to want to limit the

13

expenditures that corporations can make on

14

electioneering communication in the last 30 days of a

15

primary, over-the-air television, but not on radio, not

16

on books, not on pamphlets, not on anything else.

17

right?

18
19
20

That's what they

So Congress now says

All

So in what respect is there not conceptually
at least a compelling interest and narrow tailoring?
MR. OLSON:

Well, in the first place, I

21

accept what the Court said in Buckley, that expenditures

22

do not raise that concern at all.

23

that finding.

24

-- just a matter of radio and television, but in Buckley

25

v. Valeo the Court specifically said that that is the

Congress has not made

You are talking -- and you mentioned just

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

most important means of communicating concerning

2

elections -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. OLSON:

It's important -

And the Court used the word

5

"indispensable."

So what -- and -- and what the Court

6

said in Buckley v. Valeo is it compared a limitation on

7

expenditures, independent uncoordinated expenditures,

8

with the prohibition that the Court addressed when it

9

had a statute before it that said newspapers couldn't

10

endorse candidates on the day of election, and the

11

Torneo case, where it required a right of reply to be

12

given.

13

were unconstitutional, were considerably less, and that

14

the restriction in Buckley v. Valeo on expenditures -

And the Court said those restrictions, which

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I agree -- I agree

16

that Buckley made the distinction between contributions

17

and expenditures, and it seems to me that the

18

government's argument necessarily wants to water down

19

that distinction.

20

furtherance of Justice Breyer's point, you have two

21

cases, one in which an officeholder goes to a

22

corporation and says:

23

They say:

24
25

But in response or just in

Will you please give me money?

We can't do that.
The other is in which a corporation takes

out an ad for the -- for the candidate, which relieves
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that candidate of the responsibility of -- of

2

substantial television coverage.

3

same?

4
5
6
7

MR. OLSON:

Well, in the first place, if

there is any coordination JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I -- and I think

Buckley says no.

8

MR. OLSON:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

matter, is that always true?

11

Isn't that about the

MR. OLSON:

Buckley says But, as a practical

Well, it may not always be true.

12

In the infinite potential applications of something like

13

that, Justice Kennedy, anything might possibly be true.

14

And Justice Breyer said, well, what if Congress thought

15

or what if Congress thought the people might think that

16

that was kind of somehow suspect?

17

for prohibiting speech by a whole class of individual -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is not a basis

Well, of course, it did -

19

was a basis for prohibiting speech by, in the sense of

20

giving contributions above $2,400, by 300 million people

21

in the United States.

22

the one that Justice Kennedy was picking up, is are we

23

arguing here between you and my questions, is the

24

argument in this case about the existence of a

25

compelling interest?

But the point, which I think is

Because Congress seemed to think
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that there was certainly that; it's this concern about

2

the perception that people are, say, buying candidates.

3

Are we arguing about narrow tailoring?

4

Congress thought it was narrow tailoring.

5

arguing about whether we should second-guess Congress on

6

whether there is enough of a compelling interest and the

7

tailoring is narrow enough?

8
9
10

MR. OLSON:

Or are we

You must always second-guess

Congress when the First Amendment is in play.

And that

we are arguing -- we are not -- we are discussing -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. OLSON:

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

-- both the compelling -

-- both the compelling

15

governmental interest and the narrow tailoring, and

16

what -- what -- there is not a sufficient record.

17

reason --the government has shifted position here.

18

were, first of all, talking about the so-called

19

distortion rationale in Austin, the distortion rationale

20

which they seem to have abandoned in the -- in the

21

supplemental briefs filed in connection with this

22

argument, and they resorted to the corruption,

23

appearance of corruption.

24

record of this.

25

There isn't a sufficient

There isn't -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what about the

14
Alderson Reporting Company

The
They

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

district court's finding?

2

the three-judge court that Federal officials know of and

3

feel indebted to corporations or unions who finance ads

4

urging their election or the defeat of their opponent?

5

There was a finding of fact to that effect, was there

6

not?

7

MR. OLSON:

Wasn't there a finding before

The find -- yes.

I -- there is

8

something to that effect in the district court opinion,

9

but it doesn't cover all corporations.

10
11

It didn't focus

in specifically on expenditures.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if -- so if they just

12

covered large corporations, so you take out the mom and

13

pop single shareholder -

14
15
16

MR. OLSON:

Well, that is 97 percent of the

corporation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not 97 percent of the

17

contributions.

18

the ones from the corporations that can amass these huge

19

sums in their treasuries.

20

I mean, the contributions that count are

MR. OLSON:

I think that goes back to

21

Justice Kennedy's question, and my response, which

22

distinguishes between contributions and expenditures.

23

The point that Justice Kennedy was making in his

24

question is that under -- under some circumstances an

25

expenditure might coincide or resonate with what the
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

candidate wishes to do, but the Court looked at that

2

very carefully in Buckley v. Valeo and said that might

3

not be the case.

4

expenditures might be counterproductive when they are

5

independent, they are not coordinated with the

6

candidate, they are more directly expression by the

7

party spending the money, they are not like a

8

contribution, so they are more of an infringement on the

9

right to speak.

It might, in fact, be these

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. OLSON:

Counsel -

And they are less of a threat of

12

corruption because there is less -- there is no quid pro

13

quo there, and if there is it would be punishable as a

14

crime.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, in your

16

discussion of Austin, you rely on its inconsistency with

17

Bellotti.

18

and Austin expenditures in an individual election.

19

isn't that a significant distinction?

20

Bellotti, of course, involved a referendum

MR. OLSON:

Well, it is -- it is -- what the

21

Bellotti Court said is that we are not deciding that

22

question.

23
24
25

Why

And -- and Austin did address, you are
correct, expenditures, but it based it on a rationale JUSTICE STEVENS:

It more than said we are

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not deciding.

2

situations.

3

cited six or eight times by our later cases.

4

It said they are entirely different
You read that long footnote which has been

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

And I also read the

5

footnote 14 in the Bellotti case that cited case after

6

case after case that said corporations had rights,

7

protected rights under the First Amendment.

8

disagreeing with what you just said, Justice Stevens.

9

The Court said it was -- it was dicta, because the Court

10

I am not

did not deal with -

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it has been

12

repeated -- that footnote has been repeatedly cited in

13

subsequent cases, most of which were unanimous.

14

MR. OLSON:

Well, because it was -- and I

15

agree the Bellotti Court was not discussing that.

16

The Bellotti Court -

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But

It did discuss it

18

precisely in that footnote and it said it's a different

19

case.

20
21
22

MR. OLSON:

disagree with what you have just said, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

out differently.

24

case, right?

25

I understand and I don't

It didn't say it would come

It just said, we're not deciding that

MR. OLSON:

That -- that is -- that's the
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

point I'm trying to make.

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't mind citing that.

Bellotti didn't decide that.

4

MR. OLSON:

What Bellotti also said is -

5

and I think this is also in many decisions of this Court

6

-- the inherent worth of speech in terms of its capacity

7

for informing the public does not depend upon the

8

identity of the source, whether corporation,

9

association, union, or individual.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now that we've

11

cleared up that Bellotti didn't decide the question,

12

what is the distinction that -- why don't you think that

13

distinction makes sense?

14

you don't have a potential for corruption if a

15

corporation is simply speaking on a referendum that may

16

directly affect its interest.

17

candidate, what the Court has said in the past is that

18

you do have that problem of corruption.

In other words, a corporate -

If you are dealing with a

19

MR. OLSON:

Well -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, why

21

isn't that distinction a way to reconcile Bellotti and

22

Austin?

23

MR. OLSON:

There is a distinction, but I

24

think the distinction goes back to, A, expenditures

25

versus contributions, number one; and then secondly, it
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

goes back to what this Court said in conjunction with

2

the impossibility of finding a distinction between issue

3

ads and candidate ads.

4

application.

5
6

The line dissolves on practical

The interest -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where did we say

that?

7

MR. OLSON:

You said that repeatedly,

8

including most recently in the Wisconsin Right to Life

9

case.

And it first appeared in Buckley itself.

The

10

distinction is very hard to draw between the interest

11

that the speaker is addressing and whether it's a

12

candidate or an issue, because issues are wrapped up in

13

candidates.

14

that its fiduciary officers are representing when it

15

speaks on behalf of the corporation -

16

The corporation interest and the interests

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I don't think you are

17

correct to say the Court said there was no distinction.

18

It said the distinction requires the use of magic words.

19

And that's what they said in Wisconsin Right to Life,

too.

Both of them said there is a distinction.

Well, but the words -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's difficult to draw in

I am aware of.

MR. OLSON:

Well, what the Court -- to

use -- to use the words of the Court, which occurred

2

repeatedly, is that the distinction dissolves

3

impractical application.

4

addresses the very commonsense point that when you are

5

addressing an issue, whether you are addressing a

6

referendum matter, whether it is a proposed legislation

7

or a candidate that is going to raise taxes on the

8

corporation, those distinctions dissolve.

9

First Amendment freedom.

10

That, Justice Stevens, I think

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's all

I -- I -- I thought that

11

Buckley had narrowed the statute precisely to magic

12

words and still found it unconstitutional as applied to

13

corporations that made independent expenditures.

14

MR. OLSON:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16
17

Yes.
Isn't that what happened in

Buckley?
MR. OLSON:

The $1,000 limit in Buckley was,

18

first of all, limited to the magic words "candidacy

19

expression"; then secondly, the Court -- and the -- and

20

the words of the statute were "any person," which

21

included corporations found, the statute as narrowed

22

unconstitutional and said -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was not discussed in the

But what was discussed in the

which did include corporation.

Corporations were

12

corporations, including NAACP v. Alabama and New York

And in that part of the Buckley

So while it wasn't specifically discussed,

15

it was a part of the decision of the Court that a $1,000

the restriction of editorials appearing on election day

Suppose we

overrule these two cases.

in a situation where corporations and trade unions can

spend as much as they want in the last 30 days on

parties couldn't, because political parties can only

hard money contributions, but corporations and trade

Well, if -- if the Court decides

in favor of the arguments that we are making here, I

think what you are suggesting is that because there are

2

other limitations that someone has not challenged in

3

this case, that that would be somehow unfair and

4

unbalanced.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I'm not suggesting

that.

I am suggesting we will make a hash of this

statute, and if we are going to make a hash of this

8

statute, what do we do about it?

9

you to take a position on another important part of that

And that's why I want

statute, and that is the part that says political

11

parties themselves cannot make these expenditures that

12

we are talking about except out of hard money.

13

MR. OLSON:

What -- I want to address that

14

in this way, and I said when we were here before the

15

most fundamental right that we can exercise in a

democracy under the First Amendment is dialogue and

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

In that case the Court was confronted with a
situation where the Times made three arguments to the

Court.

11

either have to revise, basically federalize, libel law

12

to a considerable degree, which they did; or, they said,

13

we only sold 390 copies in Alabama, so you could rule in

14

our favor by saying there was no jurisdiction; or, they

15

said, we didn't even mention Sheriff Sullivan's name, so

16

you could rule in our favor on the ground that they

17

haven't proved a libel case.

They said -- for us to win, they said, you

The Court did the first.

It did the first,

19

which is the broader rather than the narrowest way to

20

address the question, and I suspect they did it -- don't

21

know, but I suspect they did it -- because they had come

22

to the conclusion that the degree of First Amendment

danger by the sort of lawsuits which were occurring in

up to by the Court now, or 28

And what I'm urging on you,

Alderson Reporting Company

Your Honor, is that by a parity of reasoning, although

2

not precisely the same situation, that there are cases

3

in which there is a -- an ongoing threat to freedom of

4

expression which may lead -- if you were to agree to

5

that, which may lead the Court to say, rather than

6

taking a narrower route to the same result, that it is

7

worth our moving away in this case from looking for the

8

narrowest way out, and determining it now, rather than

9

the next as-applied challenge.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There are -- there are two

11

separate questions that -- that have been raised in

One is -- one is that we

An entirely separate question is the issue

17

of stare decisis, and you acknowledge that stare decisis

18

was not involved in New York Times v. Sullivan, but the

19

first question obviously was.

20

MR. ABRAMS:

And stare decisis of course is

21

a question much -- much briefed by the parties, and it

22

is one which involves of course a consideration not only

23

of the merits of the decision, but certain other

factors, the length of time the decision has been in

effect and the like.

So Austin was not a new

Well, Austin was the first time

that corporate speech was barred -- corporate

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Going back to the

7

question of stare decisis, the one thing that is very

8

interesting about this area of law for the last

9

100 years is the active involvement of both State and

10

Federal legislatures in trying to find that balance

11

between the interest of protecting in their views how

the electoral process should proceed and the interests

13

of the First Amendment.

And so my question to you is, once we say

15

they can't, except on the basis of a compelling

16

government interest narrowly tailored, are we cutting

17

off or would we be cutting off that future democratic

18

process?

courts who created corporations as persons, gave birth

20

to corporations as persons, and there could be an

argument made that that was the Court's error to start

with, not Austin or McConnell, but the fact that the

23

Court imbued a creature of State law with human

24

characteristics.

25

Because what you are suggesting is that the

12

on the right, they come -- some of them at least come

13

pretty close to saying that there must be a way for

14

Citizens United to win this case other than a broad way.

15

In my view the principles at stake here are the same.

Alderson Reporting Company

doesn't clarify the situation to say that for

2

100 years -- to suggest that for 100 years we would have

3

allowed expenditure limitations, which in order to work

4

at all have to have a speaker-based distinction,

5

exemption from media, content-based distinction,

6

7

We've never allowed that.

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, I think

8

Justice Stevens was right in saying that the expenditure

9

limits that are in play in this case came into effect in

10

1947, so it has been 60 years rather than 100 years.

11

But in fact, even before that the contribution limits

12

were thought to include independent expenditures, and as

13

soon as Congress saw independent expenditures going on

14

Congress closed what it perceived to be illegal.

15

fact for 100 years corporations have made neither

16

contributions nor expenditures, save for a brief period

17

of time in the middle 1940's, which Congress very

swiftly reacted to by passing the Taft-Hartley Act.

21

I wanted to make -

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Before you go to your

23

second point, may I ask you to clarify one part of the

24

first, namely, your answer to the question I proposed to

25

Mr. Olson, namely, why isn't the Snowe-Jeffords
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Amendment, which was picked on by Congress itself, an -

2

and which is argued by the NRA, an appropriate answer to

3

this case?

5

GENERAL KAGAN:

That was my third point,

Justice Stevens.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7

(Laughter.)

8

GENERAL KAGAN:

9
10

Oh, I'm sorry.

So we will just skip over

the second.
My third point is that this is an anomalous

11

case in part because this is an atypical plaintiff.

12

the reason this is an atypical plaintiff is because this

13

plaintiff is an ideological nonprofit and -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

So you are giving up

15

-- you are giving up the distinction from MCFL that you

16

defended in your opening brief?

17

doesn't qualify as a different kind of corporation

18

because it takes corporate funds, and now you are

19

changing that position?

20

GENERAL KAGAN:

There you said this

No, I --I don't think we are

21

changing it.

22

always tried to implement MCFL faithfully.

23

what the FEC has tried to do.

24
25

MCFL is the law, and the FEA -- FEC has
And that's

But if you -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I guess -- do you

think MCFL applies in this case even though the
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

corporation takes corporate funds from for-profit

2

corporations?

3

GENERAL KAGAN:

I don't think MCFL as

4

written applies in this case, but I think that the Court

5

could, as lower courts have done, adjust MCFL

6

potentially to make it apply in this case, although I

7

think that would require a remand.

8

have done -- MCFL was set up, it was written in a very

9

strict kind of way so that the organization had to have

10

What lower courts

a policy of accepting no corporate funds whatsoever.

11

Some of the lower courts, including the D.C.

12

Circuit, which, of course, sees a lot of these cases,

13

have suggested that MCFL is too strict, that it doesn't

14

--

15
16
17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you -- do you

think it's too strict?
GENERAL KAGAN:

I -- I -- the FEC has no

18

objection to MCFL being adjusted in order to -- to give

19

it some flexibility.

20

What the -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you want to give

21

up this case, change your position, and basically say

22

you lose solely because of the questioning that we have

23

directed on reargument?

24

GENERAL KAGAN:

Solely because?

4

the judgment below should be affirmed.

5

6

I think the question really

questions.

Yet another is the question of how it

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if you -- if you

2

insist on the as-applied challenge, isn't that

3

inconsistent with the whole line of cases that began in

4

Thornhill v. Alabama and Coates v. Cincinnati?

5

about the Thornhill doctrine?

6

briefs, but that doctrine is that even a litigant

7

without standing to object to a particular form of

8

conduct can raise that if the statute covers it in order

9

that the statute does not have an ongoing chill against

What

It is not cited in the

10

speech.

And there is no place where an ongoing chill is

11

more dangerous than in the elections context.

12

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, I think even -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you are asking us to

14

have an ongoing chill where we have as-applied

15

challenges which are based on, as I indicated before,

16

speaker, content, time, and this is the kind of chilling

17

effect that the Thornhill doctrine stands directly

18

against.

19

GENERAL KAGAN:

You know, I think even in

20

the First Amendment context, Justice Kennedy, the Court

21

will not strike down a statute on its face unless it

22

finds very substantial overbreadth, many applications of

23

the statute that are unconstitutional, as opposed to

24

just a few or just some.

25

that the Court was right in McConnell and then confirmed

What I am suggesting here is

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in WRTL to find that BCRA, which is of course the only

2

statute directly involved in this case, did not have

3

that substantial overdraft.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let me ask you this.

5

Suppose that we were to rule that nonprofit corporations

6

could not be covered by the statute.

7

would the statute then have substantial overbreadth?

8
9

GENERAL KAGAN:

Would that -

Well, I would urge you not

to do that in that kind of sweeping way, because the

10

reason for the nonprofit corporations being covered is

11

to make sure that the nonprofit corporations don't

12

function as conduits for the for-profit corporations.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

that.

15

overbroad?

But suppose we were to say

Would the statute then not be substantially

16

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, I don't think that the

17

statute is substantially overbroad right now.

18

took out certain applications, I can't think -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So if you

But I am asking you to

20

assume that we draw the nonprofit/profit distinction.

21

Then the statute, it seems to me, clearly has to fall

22

because, number one, we couldn't sever it based on the

23

language.

24

GENERAL KAGAN:

I see what you are saying.

25

Well, you could do a couple of things.
42
Alderson Reporting Company

You could do

what Justice Stevens suggested.

2

suggested -- I suggested to Chief Justice Roberts -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Justice Stevens

I don't think you -- I

4

don't think you really caught what I suggested because

5

you treated it as an enlargement of the MCFL example.

6

GENERAL KAGAN:

I was going to go back.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that is not what the

8

National Rifle Association argues or what Snowe-Jeffords

9

covers.

It covers ads that are financed exclusively by

10

individuals even though they are sponsored by a

11

corporation.

12

GENERAL KAGAN:

Yes, that's exactly right.

13

What you are suggesting, Justice Stevens, is essentially

14

stripping the Wellstone amendment from the -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Correct and treating the

16

Snowe-Jeffords amendment as being the correct test.

17

nobody has explained why that wouldn't be a proper

18

solution, not nearly as drastic as -- as being argued

here.

Yes, and there are some, you

know -- there are -- there are some reasons that that

if we go that route, what we are doing is creating an

somebody, perhaps the FEC, has to decide whether in fact

Okay, so

10

Congress said, we don't want that.

11

that's going to be a nightmare, and we decide Wellstone,

for whatever reasons.

Now don't we have to focus on whether
Congress can say that or whether it can't?

certainly a narrower and I think better solution than a

facial invalidation of the whole statute.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, what do you

16

-- what do you understand to be the compelling interest

17

that the Court articulated in Austin?

18

GENERAL KAGAN:

I think that what the Court

19

articulated in Austin -- and, of course, in the

20

government briefs we have suggested that Austin did not

21

articulate what we believe to be the strongest

22

compelling interest, which is the anticorruption

23

interest.

24

essentially a concern about corporations using the

25

corporate form to appropriate other people's money for

But what the Court articulated in Austin was

45
Alderson Reporting Company

1

expressive purposes.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

So but you

3

-- you have more or less -- "abandoned" is too strong a

4

word, but as you say you have relied on a different

5

interest, the quid pro quo corruption.

6

articulate on page 11 of your brief -- you recognize

7

that this Court has not accepted that interest as a

8

compelling interest.

9

And you -- you

So isn't it the case that as you view Austin

10

it is kind of up for play in the sense that you would

11

ground it on an interest that the Court has never

12

recognized?

13

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, a couple of points.

14

The first thing is, as you say, we have not abandoned

Austin.

24

it's -- it's a concern about corporate use of other

I would say that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Putting it outside,

2

putting the quid pro quo interest aside, where in your

3

supplemental briefing do you support the interest that

4

was articulated by the Court in Austin?

5

GENERAL KAGAN:

Where we talk about

6

shareholder protection and where we talk about the

7

distortion of the electoral process that occurs when

8

corporations use their shareholders' money who may or

9

may not agree -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understand that to

11

be a different interest.

12

protection interest as opposed to the fact that

13

corporations have such wealth and they -- they distort

14

the marketplace.

15
16
17

GENERAL KAGAN:

That is the shareholder

Well, I -- I think that they

are connected because both come CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so am I right

18

then in saying that in the supplemental briefing you do

19

not rely at all on the market distortion rationale on

20

which Austin relied; not the shareholder rationale, not

21

the quid pro quo rationale, the market distortion issue.

22

These corporations have a lot of money.

23

GENERAL KAGAN:

We do not rely at all on

24

Austin to the extent that anybody takes Austin to be

25

suggesting anything about the equalization of a speech
47
Alderson Reporting Company

market.

So I know that that's the way that many people

2

understand the distortion rationale of Austin, and if

3

that's the way the Court understands i, we do not rely

4

at all on that.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if we have to

7

preserve -- if we are going to preserve Austin we have

8

to accept your invitation that the quid pro quo interest

9

supports the holding there or the shareholder protection

10
11

interest.
GENERAL KAGAN:

I would say either the quid

12

pro quo interest, the corruption interest or the

13

shareholder interest, or what I would say is a -- is

14

something related to the shareholder interest that is in

15

truth my view of Austin, which is a view that when

16

corporations use other people's money to electioneer,

17

that is a harm not just to the shareholders themselves

18

but a sort of a broader harm to the public that comes

19

from distortion of the electioneering that is done by

20

corporations.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's -- let's talk about

22

You've -- let's assume that that is a

23

valid interest.

know, distorting other -- the interests of other

think that -

I don't think so.
I think, Justice Scalia,

it's wrong.

In fact, corporate and union money go

overwhelmingly to incumbents.

7

most self-denying thing that Congress has ever done.

8

you look -- if you look at the last election cycle and

9

look at corporate PAC money and ask where it goes, it

This may be the single

10

goes ten times more to incumbents than to challengers,

11

and in the prior election cycle even more than that.

12

If

And for an obvious reason, because when

13

corporations play in the political process, they want

14

winners, they want people who will produce outcomes for

15

them, and they know that the way to get those outcomes,

16

the way to get those winners is to invest in incumbents,

17

and so that's what they do.

18

times more than they invest in challengers.

true in many contexts, simply is not the case with

13

already been used and are being used by the government

to express its views; and you say another corporation

can't object to that.

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, to the extent,

Justice Kennedy, that you are talking about what goes on

in the halls of Congress, of course corporations can

19

lobby members of Congress in the same way that they

designed to do, because of its anticorruption interest,

is to make sure that that lobbying is just persuasion

spending quite a few days one summer reading through

built an enormous record of support for this bill in the

18

evidence.

19

And I came

And my recollection is, but it is now a

20

couple of years old, that there was a lot of information

21

in that which suggested that many millions of voters

22

think, at the least, that large corporate and union

23

expenditures or contributions in favor of a candidate

24

lead the benefited political figure to decide quite

25

specifically in favor of the -- of the contributing or

expending organization, the corporation or the union.

2

GENERAL KAGAN:

Yes, that's -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, it was on the basis of

4

that, I think, that this Court upheld the law in BCRA.

5

But we have heard from the other side there isn't much

6

of a record on this.

7

So, if you could save me some time here,

8

perhaps you could point me, if I am right, to those

9

thousand pages of opinion and tens of thousands of

10

underlying bits of evidence where there might be support

11

for that proposition?

12

GENERAL KAGAN:

Yes, that's exactly right,

13

Justice Breyer, that in addition to the 100-year old

14

judgment that Congress believes this is necessary, that

15

very recently members of Congress and others created a

16

gigantic record showing that there was corruption and

17

that there was the appearance of corruption.

18

And in that record, many times senators,

19

former senators talk about the way in which fundraising

20

is at the front of their mind in everything that they do

21

the way in which they grant access, the way in which

22

they grant influence, and the way in which outcomes

23

likely change as a result of that fundraising.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

BCRA has changed all that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

Counsel, could I

ask, it seems -- to your shareholder protection

2

rationale, isn't it extraordinarily paternalistic for

3

the government to take the position that shareholders

4

are too stupid to keep track of what their corporations

5

are doing and can't sell their shares or object in the

6

corporate context if they don't like it?

7

GENERAL KAGAN:

You can't expect everybody to do that.

It's not that -- it's not

that I have a busy job.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it is

16

extraordinary -- I mean, the -- the idea and as I

17

understand the rationale, we -- we the government, big

18

brother, has to protect shareholders from themselves.

19

They might give money, they might buy shares in a

20

corporation and they don't know that the corporation is

on their interests.

The government has to keep an eye

that I have a busy job, it's that I, like most

GENERAL KAGAN:

In a world in which most

7

people own stock through mutual funds, in a world where

8

people own stock through retirement plans in which they

9

have to invest, they have no choice, I think it's very

10

difficult for individual shareholders to be able to

11

monitor what each company they own assets in is doing or

12

even to know the extent of the -

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In that respect, it's

14

unlike the union, because the -- the worker who does not

15

want to affiliate with a union cannot have funds from

16

his own pocket devoted to political causes.

17

is no comparable check for corporations.

18

GENERAL KAGAN:

But there

That's exactly right,

Justice Ginsburg.

20

a constitutional right that the unions give back

21

essentially the funds that any union member or employee

22

in the workplace does not want used for electoral

23

purposes.

24
25

In the union context, of course, it's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does that mean that

unions should be taken out, because there isn't the

same -- the shareholder protection interest doesn't -

2

there is no parallel for the union?

3

GENERAL KAGAN:

You are right about that.

4

But I -- the government believes that with respect to

5

unions, the anticorruption interest is as strong, and

6

that unions should be kept in.

7

I think what your point suggests, that

8

the -- that the union member point suggests why Congress

9

might have thought that there was a compelling interest

10

to protect corporate shareholders in the same way that,

11

let's say, dissenting union members are protected by the

12

Constitution.

13

there is no constitutional right in the corporate

14

context.

15

There is no State action, of course, so

But Congress made a judgment that it was an

16

important value that shareholders have this choice, have

the ability both to invest in our country's assets and

also to be able to choose our country's leaders.

was an explanation of some of the questions that the

5

Chief Justice asked me about what interests the

6

government was suggesting motivated these laws and are

7

compelling enough such that this Court certainly should

8

not invalidate these laws.

9

I think I did cover point two, which

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I take it we have

10

never accepted your shareholder protection interest.

11

This is a new argument.

12

GENERAL KAGAN:

13

Certainly Bellotti does not accept it.

14

you know, National Right to Work is an interesting

15

opinion, because National Right to Work accepts for a

16

unanimous court both the shareholder protection argument

17

and the anticorruption argument with respect to the

18

section 441b in particular.

19

I think that that's fair.
I would think -

Now, in later cases the Court has suggested

20

that National Right to Work was only focused on

21

contributions.

22

distinction really does not -- it's not evident on the

23

face of the opinion, and I think Chief Justice Rehnquist

24

at later -- in a later dissent suggested that he had

25

never understood it that way.

If you read National Right to Work, that

confusion on this point.

4

than that, and I think there may be some ambiguity

5

there, but I wouldn't say NRWC is a holding on

6

shareholder protection.

7

abandoned the original rationale in Austin, and

8

articulated different rationales, you have two, the quid

10

protection interest -

11
12
13

So to the extent that you

GENERAL KAGAN:

Which we think is not in

Austin.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Austin, I thought,

14

was based on the aggregation of immense wealth by

15

corporations.

16

GENERAL KAGAN:

Again, Austin is not the

17

most lucid opinion.

18

what Austin was suggesting was that the corporate form

19

gave corporations significant assets, other people's

20

money that when the corporations spent those assets -

21

But the way we understand Austin,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can you -- can you

22

give me the citation to the page in Austin where we

23

accepted the shareholder protection rationale?

24

GENERAL KAGAN:

I think it comes when the -

25

when the Court is distinguishing MCFL.
62
Alderson Reporting Company

And the message

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of that distinction of MCFL is the shareholder

2

protection interest?

3

But -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do the words

4

"shareholder" -- I don't know, do the words "shareholder

5

protection" appear in the Austin opinion?

6
7

GENERAL KAGAN:
Mr. Chief Justice.

8
9

I honestly don't know,

And -- and I don't want to -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If they don't -

let's assume they don't, then I get back to my question,

10

which is, you are asking us to defend the Austin or

11

support or continue the Austin opinion on the basis of

12

two rationales that we have never accepted, shareholder

13

protection and quid pro quo corruption?

14

GENERAL KAGAN:

I would say on the quid pro

15

quo corruption, of course you have accepted that

16

rationale -

17
18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In the context of

contributions, not expenditures.

19

GENERAL KAGAN:

That's correct.

And I think

20

what has changed since -- since that time is the BCRA

21

record that Justice Breyer suggested, which was very

22

strong on the notion that there was no difference when

23

it came to corporate contributions and expenditures,

24

that there actually was no difference between the two.

25

That they 63

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that a yes?

Is

2

that a yes?

3

Austin on the basis of two arguments, two principles,

4

two compelling interests we have never accepted, in

5

expenditure context.

6

In other words, you are asking us to uphold

In this -- in this

7

particular context, fair enough.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And to undercut Buckley in

so doing?

11

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, I don't think so,

12

because I do think Buckley was about individuals rather

13

than corporations, and Buckley was in 1976, not in 2009,

14

after the very extensive record that was created in

15

BCRA.

16

I see my time is up.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't -

May I ask you one

18

question that was highlighted in the prior argument, and

19

that was if Congress could say no TV and radio ads,

20

could it also say no newspaper ads, no campaign

21

biographies?

22

could, but it didn't.

23

government's answer?

Last time the answer was, yes, Congress
Is that -- is that still the

changed, Justice Ginsburg.

The government's answer has

Alderson Reporting Company

(Laughter.)

2

GENERAL KAGAN:

It is still true that BCRA

3

203, which is the only statute involved in this case,

4

does not apply to books or anything other than

5

broadcast; 441b does, on its face, apply to other media.

6

And we took what the Court -- what the Court's -- the

7

Court's own reaction to some of those other

8

hypotheticals very seriously.

9

considered the matter carefully, and the government's

We went back, we

10

view is that although 441b does cover full-length books,

11

that there would be quite good as-applied challenge to

12

any attempt to apply 441b in that context.

13

And I should say that the FEC has never

14

applied 441b in that context.

15

has never been at issue.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So for 60 years a book

What happened to the

17

overbreadth doctrine?

18

the Fourth Amendment is if you write it too broadly, we

19

are not going to pare it back to the point where it's

20

constitutional.

21

has happened to that.

22

I mean, I thought our doctrine in

If it's overbroad, it's invalid.

GENERAL KAGAN:

What

I don't think that it would

23

be substantially overbroad, Justice Scalia, if I tell

24

you that the FEC has never applied this statute to a

25

book.

To say that it doesn't apply to books is to take
65
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

off, you know, essentially nothing.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But we don't put our

3

-- we don't put our First Amendment rights in the hands

4

of FEC bureaucrats; and if you say that you are not

5

going to apply it to a book, what about a pamphlet?

6

GENERAL KAGAN:

I think a -- a pamphlet

7

would be different.

8

electioneering, so there is no attempt to say that 441 b

9

only applies to video and not to print.

10

A pamphlet is pretty classic

JUSTICE ALITO:

It does -

Well, what if the

11

particular -- what if the particular movie involved here

12

had not been distributed by Video on Demand?

13

that people could view it for free on Netflix over the

14

internet?

15

Suppose people could attend the movie for free in a

16

movie theater; suppose the exact text of this was

17

distributed in a printed form.

19

draw the line with respect to the medium that could be

20

prohibited.

21

Suppose that free DVDs were passed out.

GENERAL KAGAN:

In light of your

Well, none of those things,

again, are covered.
JUSTICE ALITO:

No, but could they?

of them could and which could not?

say books could not.
66

Which

I understand you to

GENERAL KAGAN:

Yes, I think what you -

what we're saying is that there has never been an

3

enforcement action for books.

4

suggested -- nobody in Congress, nobody in the

5

administrative apparatus has ever suggested that books

6

pose any kind of corruption problem, so I think that

7

there would be a good as-applied challenge with respect

8

to that.

Nobody has ever

except that I have just said that there would be a good

as-applied challenge and that there has been no

administrative practice of ever applying it to the

25

books.

And also only applies to express advocacy,
67
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right?

203 has -- is -- is -- has a broader category of

2

the functional equivalent of express advocacy, but 441b

3

is only express advocacy, which is a part of the reason

4

why it has never applied to a book.

5

very many books that would meet the definition of

express advocacy as this Court has expressed that.

One cannot imagine

Oh, I'm sorry, we

of union organizing and union involvement in politics,

and the last sentence says in light of all this, vote

GENERAL KAGAN:

AS AMICI CURIAE,
IN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLEE
MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The requirement that corporations fund
68
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

electoral advocacy the same way individuals do, that is

2

with money voluntarily committed by people associated

3

with the corporation, is grounded in interests that are

4

so compelling that 52 years ago, before Buckley was

5

decided, before FECA was enacted, before Buckley-style

6

quid pro quo corruption was ever addressed, this Court

7

explained that, quote:

8

integrity of our electoral process and not less the

9

responsibility of the individual citizen for the

10

"What is involved here is the

successful functioning of that process."

11

If the Court now wishes to reconsider the

12

existence and extent of the interests that underlie that

13

sentiment expressed for the Court by Justice Frankfurter

14

in the context of a prosecution of union officials for

15

running television ads supporting political candidates,

16

it should do so in a case in which those interests are

17

forthrightly challenged with a proper and full record

18

below.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One of the amicus

20

briefs, I'm not -- maybe it's professor Hayward, if I am

21

getting that right -- suggested the history of this 1947

22

provision was such that it really wasn't enforced

23

because people were concerned about the First Amendment

24

interests and that the courts to the extent cases were

25

brought did everything they could to avoid enforcing the
69
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

limitations.
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I don't recall who the

3

professor was either, Mr. Chief Justice, but I do recall

4

pretty well the history that was recounted -- I would

5

say the history that was recounted by this Court in the

6

Auto Workers case, in CIO, in the Pipefitters case,

7

which is quite inconsistent with that.

8

this case -- until this Court's supplemental order, we

9

never had a case that challenged directly, quote,

We've never had

10

"Austin" and Austin-style corruption, which is a term I

11

think that is quite misleading.

12

When the sober-minded Elihu Root was moved

13

to stand up in 1894 and urged the people of the United

14

States, and urged the Congress of the United States, to

15

enact legislation that would address, quote, "a

16

constantly growing evil which has done more to shake the

17

confidence of plain people of small means of this

18

country in our political institutions than any practice

19

which has ever obtained since the founding of our

20

government," he was not engaging in a high level

21

discussion about political philosophy.

22

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. WAXMAN:

But he was talking about
That's quite clear.

He -- with all due respect,

Justice Kennedy, I don't think that there was any
70
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

distinction whatsoever in that time between the

2

distinction that this Court came to understand as a

3

result of FECA, and its adjudication of FECA and that -

4

really the prehistory of Taft-Hartley, between

5

contributions expenditures.

6

For this reason, Justice Kennedy, was that

7

what Root said was the idea -- and I am quoting now from

8

his speech which is also partly reprinted in this

9

Court's opinion in McConnell -- the idea is to prevent

10

the great companies, the great aggregations of wealth

11

from using corporate funds directly or indirectly to

12

send members of the legislature to these halls in order

13

to vote for their protection and the advancement of

14

their interests as against those of the public.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Great aggregations of

16

wealth.

The brief by the Chamber of Commerce, the

17

amicus brief by the Chamber of Commerce points out that

18

96 percent of its members employ less than 100 people.

19

These are not aggregations of great wealth.

20

talking about the railroad barons and the rapacious

21

trusts of the Elihu Root era; you are talking mainly

22

about small business corporations.

23

MR. WAXMAN:

You are not

Justice Scalia, I take your

24

point and I think you have made this point forceful lily

25

many times before.

2

to make the judgment that it would treat in order to

address this root evil, a problem of such concern that

4

it goes to the very foundation of the democratic

5

republican exercise, that is, the notion of integrity in

6

representative government.

7
8

Now this -- this case, of course, is not a
case -

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand that

10

answer.

11

about, what Elihu Root was concerned about, you could

12

have said all corporations that have a net worth of more

13

than, you know, so much or whatever.

14

Congress did.

15

I mean, if that's what you were concerned

That is not what

It said all corporations.

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

And Justice Scalia, if

16

a small corporation or even any corporation of any sort

17

wants to bring an as-applied challenge to 441b or a

18

State law analogue and say, you know, I am not the

19

problem that Theodore Roosevelt and Elihu Root was

20

addressed at; there isn't a compelling interest because

21

I only have three employees and $8,000 in my bank

22

account, that's fine.

23

extraordinary, given the sentiments that underlay the

24

But, No. 1, the

by individuals and not corporations.

more than I am saying that it shouldn't consider Austin

about a wide range of public policy issues, and since

the controlling opinion was issued in Wisconsin Right to

Life, the -- the kind of campaign-related speech that

MR. WAXMAN:

My point here is, Justice Alito

-- and I don't mean to be -- to be demeaning this Court

10

with sound bites.

11

to be sure, the very first case in which this Court had

12

to decide -- actually had to decide whether or not the

13

prohibition on corporate treasury funded campaign speech

14

could properly be limited and was supporting by a

15

compelling interest.

16

that if you take nothing else from my advocacy today it

17

will be this -- is that we have here a case in which the

18

Court has asked a question that essentially goes to the

19

bona fides, that is, the factual predicates of the

20

interests that have been viewed as compelling in Austin,

21

in MCFL, in McConnell itself, whether you call it the

22

corrosive effect of corporate wealth, whether you call

23

it, quote, "shareholder protection" -

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

The point is that what -- Austin was,

All I am suggesting -- and I hope

And my point is that there

is nothing unusual whatsoever about a case in which a
74
Alderson Reporting Company

party before the Court says, my constitutional rights

2

were violated, and there is no prior decision of this

3

Court holding that what was done is constitutional.

4

in that situation is it an answer to that argument that

5

this has never been challenged before?

6

never held that it was unconstitutional?

7

accepted up until this point by the general public that

8

this is -- that this is constitutional?

9

regarded as an answer to that question.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

And

The Court has

difficult to tell the two apart.

to Justice Sotomayor's question, you know, about there

any restriction that it imposes passes strict scrutiny.

The government has to prove that

Fair enough, but the question has to be

21

raised.

The issue has to be raised.

Austin, Justice Alito, or the compelling interests that

Austin and McConnell relied on were forthrightly

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Mr. Waxman,

2

the government did have that opportunity, and the

3

government compiled a record.

4

United abandoned that position -- you are quite right,

5

they changed their course -- the government and the

6

district court complained that it had to go to all this

7

work to develop this record, and yet we hear nothing

8

about what the record showed.

MR. WAXMAN:

And when the Citizens

Well, that's because the

ultimate -- I assume I have your permission to answer.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Go ahead.

The -- the only challenges that

13

were litigated in the district court -- and they largely

14

were related to disclosure -- were very direct

15

as-applied challenges that had -- that did nothing

16

whatsoever to implicate the foundation of McConnell or

17

Austin.

18

examine the predicates, the existence and magnitude of

19

interests that Congress has, going back a -- whether

20

it's 60 years or 100 years, and courts, whether it has

21

been the actual rationale of the decision or a predicate

22

of the rationale of the decision, you ought to do it in

23

a case where the -- where the issue is squarely

presented so that the government can do what it did in

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

7

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

8

The words that I would leave with this Court are the

9

Solicitor General's.

The government's position has

10

changed.

11

what media might be covered by congressional power to

12

censor and -- and ban speech by corporations.

13

learn, contrary to what we heard in March, that books

14

couldn't be prohibited but pamphlets could be

15

prohibited.

16

The government's position has changed as to

Now we

We also learn JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's not -- the -

17

the statute that we are involved in, in this case does

18

not cover those.

19

MR. OLSON:

Unless they are engaged in,

20

quote, "expressed advocacy."

And the other way in which

21

the government has changed its position, if I listened

22

carefully, is what type of corporation might be covered.

23

The government now says that it wouldn't -- the -- the

24

FEC is now willing to recede from its regulations which

25

explicitly covered this corporation, and I don't know as
77
Alderson Reporting Company

I stand here today what kind of corporations the

2

government would choose to prosecute.

3

Remember, the Federal Election Commission,

4

which didn't even have a quorum and couldn't function at

5

all for six months during the important election year of

6

2008 -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If the FEC chooses to

prosecute only those who do not -- who do not rely

exclusively on individual contributions.

MR. OLSON:

12
13

Well, that's your question from

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.

I want to see he

gets it.
MR. OLSON:

And that -- (a), it wouldn't -

15

this corporation accepted a small amount, $2,000 out of

16

-- out of the funding of this, so that wouldn't solve

17

the problem for my corporation, my client's corporation.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it would solve it for

19

the advertising, and there are two things.

cover those.

22

MR. OLSON:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24
25

There is the
It would

If -- but the And they are the only -

only ones that clearly violate the statute.
MR. OLSON:

My point is that the overbreadth
78

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in this statute -- that solves the problem by saying

2

that corporations still can't speak, and if you don't

3

have anything to do with them, you -- you -- they wear a

4

scarlet letter that says "C."

5

of funding, then you had better make darn sure that when

6

a check comes in for $100 from the XYZ hardware store in

7

the neighborhood, that it wasn't a corporation that you

8

used to -- to make a documentary about a candidate.

9

The other way in which the government's

If you accept one dollar

10

position has changed is we do not know -

It would lead exactly -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If it solved the problem

16

as it would for the advertising, would it be an

17

appropriate solution?

18

MR. OLSON:

It -- I can't say that it -- if

19

it solved the problem, because it doesn't solve the

20

problem of prohibiting all corporate speech.

21

think -- and I am submitting, Justice Stevens, that that

22

is unconstitutional.

23

that some limitation that -- what -- what you were

24

suggesting is not a whole lot different than PAC.

25

would lead, I think Justice Breyer was saying, to an

And I

I think what you are suggesting is

79
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

accounting nightmare.

2
3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. OLSON:

Well, but the -- but the

Wellstone Amendment sort of in a sense repealed it.

6
7

But it is a nightmare that

Congress endorsed in the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment.

4
5

It would be -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We have held the Wellstone

Amendment literally cannot be applied.

8

MR. OLSON:

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

MR. OLSON:

Well We unanimously held that.

I think what -- what the -- my

11

response is that that does not solve the problem of

12

inhibiting -

13
14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You do not endorse the

NRA's position?

15

MR. OLSON:

No, we don't Justice Stevens,

16

and -- and, as I said, it would not exempt my clients.

17

The other -- the third way in which the government has

18

changed its position is its rationale for this

19

prohibition in the first place.

20

it shareholder protection?

21

Is it corruption?

Is

Is it equalization?

There was some dispute.

I heard the

22

Solicitor General say that the equalization rationale

23

was something the government disavowed.

24

Austin said, the government -- the government said.

25

I 80
Alderson Reporting Company

It wasn't what
And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Justice Marshall said

2

that he was not trying to equalize all voices in the

3

political process.

4

that's not what the rationale of this case is.

5

He has a sentence that says, well,

MR. OLSON:

I don't -- I don't -- with all

6

due respect Justice Ginsburg, the words that jump out at

7

me are the words from page 665 that say the desire to

8

counterbalance those advantages unique to the corporate

9

forum is the state's compelling interest in this case.

10
11

That sounds to me like -- like equalization.
I don't know.

I am -- I am representing an

12

individual who wants to speak about something that's the

13

most important thing that goes on in our democracy.

14

told it's a felony.

15

what the rational basis is.

16

about this shareholder -- protecting shareholders.

17

There is not a word in the congressional record with

18

respect to the -- which was before the Court in the

19

McConnell case about protecting shareholders.

20

Bellotti case pointed out, that would be overbroad

21

anyway because this statute applies to every -

22

I'm

I am not -- and I -- I don't know

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's overbroad.

Now I hear

As the

Actually I read that

23

sentence that you just read as meaning the corporation

24

is an artificial person in respect to which the State

25

creates many abilities and capacities, and the State is
81
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

free also to create some disabilities and capacities.

2

Not a statement about balancing rich and poor.

3

MR. OLSON:

Well, it -- it -- it strikes me

4

that it is, because it follows the words that say

5

corporations are given unique advantages to aggregate

6

wealth and that we must take away that advantage by

7

equalizing the process.

8

meaning but my point I guess is -- if I may finish this

9

sentence.

I think that's the plain

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. OLSON:

Briefly.

My point is that the government

12

here has an overbroad statute that covers every

13

corporation irrespective of what its stockholders think,

14

irrespective of whether it's big, and whether it's

15

general -- a big railroad baron or anything like that,

16

and it doesn't know, as it stands here today two years

17

after this movie was offered for -- to the public for

18

its view, what media might be covered, what type of

19

corporation might be covered and what compelling

20

justification or narrow standard would be applied to

21

this form of speech.

22
23
24
25
