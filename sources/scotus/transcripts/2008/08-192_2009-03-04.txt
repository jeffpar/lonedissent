ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

A person who purchases a small quantity of

11

drugs for his own personal use commits a misdemeanor,

12

not a felony.

13

transform that person into a felon if he uses a phone in

14

obtaining his drugs, rather than doing so strictly face

15

to face.

16

The language of section 843(b) does not

I would like to begin with the text of the

17

statute before turning to the textual history and the

18

statutory context.

19

covers the use of the phone in committing, in

20

facilitating, or in causing a drug felony.

21

language presupposes someone who is causing,

22

facilitating, or committing a drug felony, and with

23

respect to such a person, it makes them guilty of an

24

additional offense in the nature of an aggravated

25

offense if they use a phone in their committing,

The language of section 843(b)

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

who those persons would be?

4

drug user.

5

Can you be specific about
You say not a misdemeanant

So who would be caught in the 843(b)?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

It would depend on which

6

prong you're referring to, Justice Ginsburg.

7

committing prong refers to persons who are committing

8

the underlying drug felony.

9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
MR. SRINIVASAN:

The -- the

Yes.
And the facilitating prong

11

would refer to persons who are aiding or abetting the

12

underlying drug felony.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose you had the

14

girlfriend phone and say:

My boyfriend needs drugs;

15

meet him at the corner of 3rd and Main.

16

the girlfriend commit?

17

clear that she's under 843(b) facilitating.

What crime does

It seems to me that it's pretty

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

She -- she may -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that she

20

may then have committed a felony, and yet it seems to me

21

that her culpability is certainly no -- no greater, if

22

you're talking about your -- the polity of your statute,

23

than the man who uses the drugs.

24
25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think I'm speaking

first and foremost about the terms of the statute,
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Kennedy.

2

terms of the statute, it would be because she doesn't

3

benefit from the buyer-seller rule.

4

rule establishes that buyers of drugs aren't aiders or

5

abettors of the distribution of drugs, and equivalently

6

they wouldn't be treated as facilitators of the

7

distribution of drugs.

8
9
10

And to the extent she fits within the

The buyer-seller

Now -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Maybe Justice Ginsburg

would like some further illustration, but I thought that
that was one illustration in answer to her question.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, I would like to -

12

who does this target?

13

school exam type question, but in the real world who is

14

covered?

15

The girlfriend is a good law

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think the classic

16

case of somebody under the facilitating prong would be

17

the classic aider and abettor, for example a lookout.

18

If there were a lookout on the scene of a drug

19

transaction, and they used the communication facility to

20

communicate with the distributor to let them know that

21

buyers were arriving or that law enforcement was in the

22

neighborhood and the person ought to refrain from

23

engaging in the transaction for the time being.

24

would be the sort of person that comes within 18 U.S.C.

25

2 as an aider or abettor of drug distribution and would
5
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

come within 843(b) as a facilitator of drug

2

distribution.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

The buyer -- seller rule

4

would prohibit the prosecution of a buyer on the theory

5

that the buyer aided and abetted, aided and abetted the

6

seller.

7

not a situation like that.

8

using a communications facility in facilitating the

9

commission of a felony.

10

But I don't see why it applies here.

This is

This is a different crime,

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, it deals with the use

11

of a communication facility only with respect to persons

12

that are committing, facilitating or causing a drug

13

felony.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is the purpose -- what

15

is the purpose of saying who uses a communications

16

facility?

17

Is that purely a jurisdictional hook?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, I don't think it's a

18

jurisdictional hook.

There would already be Federal

19

jurisdiction by virtue of the underlying felony, and so

20

what Congress was concerned with in penalizing the use

21

of a phone as in the nature of an aggravated offense is

22

that I think Congress thought that phones were being

23

used to make detection of drug trafficking more

24

difficult, and in particular at the level of someone who

25

was at top of the food chain in the architecture of a
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

drug distribution chain, that person was able to avoid

2

detection because they never came into physical contact

3

with drugs and they didn't come into physical contact

4

with the persons who were engaging in the transaction on

5

the street.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You keep talking

7

about phones and you began by saying this covers phones,

8

but this was -- language was added in 1970?

9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

10

Right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there weren't

11

cell phones of the kind you have now.

I think this was

12

directed at the beepers, right, when those were around

13

then, or land-based phones or something like that.

14

the technology has so expanded that the reach of the

15

statute has so expanded in a way that brings in a lot

16

more casual users than was the case before, and I just

17

don't know how that issue of statutory interpretation is

18

supposed to be resolved.

19

technology has dramatically expanded the reach of the

20

statute, even if you think it's covered by its terms,

21

how is that issue addressed?

22

there?

23

breadth has expanded, or because this is something new

24

technologically that the statute shouldn't be construed

25

that broadly?

And

Assuming I'm right that the

What's the right answer

Is it because the terms still cover it, the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, I don't -- our argument

2

doesn't depend on assuming that cell phone usage was

3

significant in the 1970s.

4

would exclude from its sweep buyers of drugs.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even in 1970 the statute

Well, I know, but

6

let's assume I don't agree -- let's assume I agree with

7

that only in the context of the 1970s technology.

8

MR. SRINIVASAN:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

What's the answer

then?

11
12

Uh-huh.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, if you agree with it

--

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It reminds me of

14

these old hypotheticals.

15

automobiles, you had to have someone with a lantern walk

16

in front of your carriage, and they don't change the law

17

and it still turns out to be the law when you're driving

18

your car and it doesn't make any sense.

19

You know, before you had

Is there a case of ours that says what to do

20

in that case, in such a situation of statutory

21

construction?

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I'm not aware of a case

23

that speaks directly to that question, Mr. Chief

24

Justice.

25

because even in 1970 certainly land lines were well in

But our argument doesn't depend on that logic,

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

use, and in fact the indications are that that's what

2

Congress was principally concerned with in this statute.

3

And at that time we would make the argument, just as

4

now, a person who used the telephone in buying drugs for

5

personal use wouldn't come within the ambit of the

6

provision because the text of the provision goes to

7

someone who uses a phone in committing, in facilitating,

8

or in causing the commission of a drug felony.

9

if you're not someone who's facilitating the commission

And so

10

of a drug felony in the first place, then you can't be

11

charged as using a phone in facilitating a drug felony.

12

The reason that a buyer for personal use, whether we're

13

talking about 1970 or now, wouldn't be considered a

14

person who is using a phone in facilitating a drug

15

felony is because of the buyer-seller rule.

16

aren't aiders and abetters of the felony distribution,

17

and by the same token they shouldn't be considered

18

facilitators of felony distribution.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Buyers

Your argument sort of

20

assumes -- more than sort of assumes; it assumes -- that

21

facilitating is the same as aiding and abetting.

22

they meant aiding and abetting, it's a classic criminal

23

law term, they could have said aiding and abetting.

24

They didn't.

25

Why should I think facilitating means aiding and

If

They used a different term, facilitating.

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

abetting?

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

For several reasons, Your

3

Honor.

4

Law Dictionary defines "facilitating" as "an act of

5

aiding or helping or making easier," and it in turn

6

defines "aiding and abetting" as "to facilitate the

7

commission of the crime."

8

thing.

9

First, their definitional equivalence.

Black's

So they mean the very same

And I don't think there's anything

10

talismanic about the particular formulation "aiding and

11

abetting" and in fact the Court established that in its

12

opinion in Gebardi.

13

barred transporting a woman for purposes of engaging in

14

immoral acts or aiding or assisting in that

15

transportation or causing the transportation.

16

statute uses a different formulation -

17

That dealt with the Mann Act, which

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that

Well, but I mean

18

it's natural to view the woman in that situation more as

19

a victim than as someone facilitating the crime.

20

MR. SRINIVASAN:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22
23

Well I'm not sure that

would extend to your case.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I don't know -- the

24

opinion doesn't stand on the rationale that the woman

25

would be a victim.

It stands on the rationale that
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress when it defined the primary offense, which is

2

transporting -

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but that was the

4

same word.

5

Here you have "purchase," one, "facilitating" with a

6

telephone, two.

7

That was "transporting" in both instances.

That's different.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, it doesn't use the

8

word "purchase," with respect, Justice Kennedy.

9

the words "commit, facilitate or cause."

It uses

Those are the

10

three persons who come within section 843(b).

11

precisely parallel fashion, under 18 U.S.C. 2, a general

12

aider or abettor provision, that provision applies to

13

persons who commit the underlying offense, who aid or

14

abet the underlying offense or who cause the underlying

15

offense.

16

reinforces that facilitating in 843(b) serves the same

17

purpose and means the same thing as aiding or abetting

18

and the other words that apply in section -

19

And in

And that precisely parallel structure

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'll think about it,

20

but I think Gebardi does involve one statute, one act,

21

transportation.

22

felony is the purchase or possession, and the second

23

statute is use of the telephone.

24

think about it, but I don't think Gebardi works.

25

This involves two.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

The underlying

So I don't -- I'll

I don't think that's a

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

distinction that ultimately makes a difference, Justice

2

Kennedy, for the following reason.

3

deal both with someone who is involved in the underlying

4

felony and use of the phone on top of that, but it's in

5

the nature of an aggravated offense.

6

somebody who is committing, causing or facilitating the

7

underlying drug offense, and then it makes them guilty

8

of an aggravated offense if they use a phone in the

9

course of doing so.

This statute does

It presupposes

So the first question you'd have to

10

ask is whether the person is committing, facilitating or

11

causing the drug felony in the first place.

12

And if I could use one hypothetical statute

13

to illustrate that.

14

facilitating, dealt by terms with use of a phone in

15

aiding or abetting a drug felony, you would still have

16

use of the phone in addition to the underlying drug

17

felony.

18

looking at that provision is whether the person who's

19

accused of violating the law were aiding or abetting a

20

drug felony.

21

If this statute, instead of saying

But the first question I think one would ask in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- this statute does

22

not just apply to facilitating a drug offense.

It

23

applies to any of the felonies covered by subchapter 2

24

of the relevant chapter.

25

strange to have what is a misdemeanor by a buyer

I agree, it seems a little

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

converted into a -- into a felony just by use of the

2

phone.

3

provisions would arise that create a similar oddity?

4

you have any in mind?

5

What other situations under other felony

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Do

I don't know that there are

6

other provisions that would create a similar oddity.

7

think this one is particularly anomalous, the use of a

8

statute to penalize somebody who otherwise would be a

9

misdemeanant, except that they use a phone in the course

10
11

I

of the purchase for personal use.
The classic situations in which the statute

12

does apply which aren't anomalous because they make

13

sense given what Congress had in mind, would be the use

14

of a phone to facilitate drug distribution, if someone

15

were a lookout again or if someone were a trafficker and

16

they instructed, for example, retail sellers where to go

17

to pick up stock, a stock house of drugs.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This really isn't

19

the transformation of a misdemeanor into a felony.

20

a separate, separate activity and an activity that

21

facilitates the commission of a crime.

22

to carry out your drug distribution business if people

23

are calling you on their cell phones than if they have

24

to meet you in person or call from a land line.

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It's

It's much easier

Well, two steps to respond

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to that question, Mr. Chief Justice.

First, in terms of

2

whether it makes it easier, I think one could say the

3

very same thing in an aiding or abetting prosecution.

4

Aiding or abetting means the same thing as facilitating,

5

and so you could make the argument, I think, that buying

6

drugs and engaging in the sorts of actions that

7

naturally accompany the purchasing enterprise make the

8

sale easier, including directing where the sale is going

9

to occur and things like that.

But we know already that

10

buyers of drugs aren't considered aiders and abettors of

11

drugs for purposes of liability under 18 U.S.C. 2.

12

I think by the same token they shouldn't be considered

13

facilitators of drugs for purposes of section 843(b),

14

and with respect -- I'm sorry?

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

What if the -- the defendant

16

-- what if the defendant who is a buyer of -- of a

17

quantity for personal use does more than simply purchase

18

the drugs?

19

telephone conversation that makes it easier for the

20

transaction to take place or less likely -- less likely

21

that there is -- that the person is going to be

22

apprehended?

23

What if information is communicated in the

Would that person fall within the statute?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't think so, Justice

24

Alito.

I probably would have to know more about exactly

25

what they did, but if it is a -- if what they did is a
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

normal incident of purchasing, then I think it would

2

fall within the buyer-seller rule.

3

Otherwise, I think the government under an

4

18 U.S.C. 2 prosecution for aider and abettor liability

5

could make precisely the same sorts of arguments.

6

government could argue, for example, that this person

7

didn't just buy drugs.

8

because they made the first phone call.

9

accept the first phone call.

The

They instigated the purchase
They didn't

They made the first phone

10

call, and so that takes them outside the buyer-seller

11

rule.

12

But I don't that argument would work under

13

18 U.S.C. 2 because making the first phone call is a

14

normal incident of purchasing.

15

who purchases drugs for personal use is going to want to

16

take measures to make sure that the purchase goes

17

through.

18

on the drugs.

19

And, of course, someone

Their ultimate objective is to get their hands
And so -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This statute doesn't -

20

it doesn't differentiate between buyer and seller in

21

terms of who makes the call.

22

his or her own use would be just as susceptible to this

23

statute if the dealer called and said:

24

of cocaine; I know you're interested in having it.

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I gather the purchaser for

I've got a gram

That's -- that's right,

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Ginsburg.

It would apply equally in that

2

situation, and from our perspective that points up even

3

more of the anomaly in applying it to this factual

4

context.

5

U.S.C. 2.

And that would equally be the case under 18

6

One could draw distinctions between who

7

makes the initial phone call and other sorts of normal

8

incidents of the purchasing enterprise.

9

think, Justice Alito, that because someone engages in a

But I don't

10

drug -- in -- in a transaction in a way that makes it

11

particularly likely that the purchase is going to be

12

successful, that that alone would take you outside the

13

buyer-seller rule.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

What would happen in the

15

situation where the person who buys the drug is guilty

16

of -- of a felony?

17

possession.

18

understanding of the buyer-seller rule in that situation

19

lead to the conclusion that even that person could not

20

be convicted under this statute for facilitating the

21

commission of the felony of sale?

22

It's an instance of felony

Wouldn't the application of your

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, I don't think so,

23

because the buyer-seller rule deals with the

24

circumstance in which the way the person is -- is

25

associated with a felony is they're associated with the
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

distributor's felony.

And so what the buyer-seller rule

2

says is that a buyer isn't an aider and abettor of the

3

seller's distribution, and I think by the same token

4

shouldn't be associated with the seller's facilitation.

5

But in your hypothetical, where the buyer

6

himself is committing a felony because his possession

7

because of certain characteristics associated with it

8

make it a felony, the buyer himself would be committing

9

a felony.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that may -- that may

11

be true, but the buyer there still could not under your

12

theory be convicted of facilitating the seller's felony

13

of selling the drugs.

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Right, couldn't be

15

convicted of facilitating the seller's felony, but would

16

fall within the ambit of section 843(b) in any event

17

because they would have used the phone in connection

18

with their own felony.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your gloss on this

20

statute makes -- gives rise to some difficult questions

21

of proof.

22

something, and the guy says, well, I was just buying in

23

bulk for personal use, like a Costco dealer.

What if it's -- I don't know -- ten pounds of

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I -- I don't know about

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that, but -- but I think what I do know is it doesn't

2

create any greater problems of application than already

3

exist under Federal drug laws.

4

laws bar both possession for personal use under the

5

civil possession statute, section 844, and possession

6

with intent to distribute under 841.

7

Because the Federal drug

And so courts and juries and the government

8

already have to make those sorts of decisions, and I

9

don't know that they've been particularly difficult to

10

make.

They have to draw a distinction between the sorts

11

of quantities and other aspects of the offense that

12

bring it within the possession with intent to distribute

13

plan or whether the possession is of such a small

14

quantity, and there aren't other associated

15

characteristics of the offense that make it possession

16

for purposes of personal use.

17

That distinction is one that's already

18

embedded in the fabric of the drug laws, and we're just

19

applying the same distinction for purposes of this

20

statute.

21

complicated than it already is.

22

I don't think we're making it any more

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the government were to

23

prevail here, I assume that it would then as a result

24

have a much larger, more expansive discretion in

25

charging and plea bargaining and -- and et cetera.

Other than the rule of lenity, is there anything in our

cases that indicates that we should be cautious about

giving the government that authority so that that's an

aid in our interpretation or is that just all within the

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Other than And I don't -- I don't -- I

don't know of any background principle that one would

bring to bear on that other than the -- the normal tools

MR. SRINIVASAN:

my understanding is that circumspection is given voice

through the rule of lenity.

of particular applicability here is the statutory

history, is the statutory history.

4

in terms of the enacted statutory text; not legislative

5

history, but the history of the enacted statutory text.

6

But a background principle

And I'm speaking now

And what that bears on is not the word

7

"facilitating," which is what the buyer-seller rule

8

particularly pertains to, but the word "felony," which

9

is another word in the text of the statute.

And so

10

Congress could have barred the use of a phone in

11

connection with any drug offense, including a drug

12

misdemeanor, but Congress pointedly didn't do so.

13

barred the use of a phone in connection only with a drug

14

felony.

the use of a phone in connection with a drug felony, the

effect is to exclude from the purview of the statute use

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now,

That was changed in 1970,

20

wasn't it?

21

then Congress changed it to "felony"?

22

It

Wasn't the text "offense" originally, and

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right, Justice

23

Ginsburg.

Before the Controlled Substances Act, the

24

communication facility provision barred the use of a

25

phone in connection with any drug offense.
20
Alderson Reporting Company

And in 1970

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in the Controlled Substances Act Congress narrowed its

2

reach to encompass only use of a phone in connection

3

with a drug felony.

4

So it excluded use of a phone in connection

5

with a drug misdemeanor, and that's significant in two

6

respects.

7

statutory context of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act,

8

it's significant because Congress excluded use of a

9

phone in connection with a drug misdemeanor.

10

One is, even without reference to the

Petitioner used a phone in connection with

11

his misdemeanor simple possession.

12

government's argument, the very same conduct by the very

13

same person would be brought back into the fold of the

14

statute.

15

brought back into the fold of the statute by recasting

16

it as facilitating the dealer's felony.

17

But under the

Even though Congress excluded it, it would be

And the mode of analysis the Court used in

18

Gebardi and the mode of analysis that underlies the

19

buyer-seller rule to begin with would -- would lead us

20

not to infer that Congress would have intended that

21

result.

22

But in terms of the history and the

23

statutory context which you were alluding to, Justice

24

Ginsburg, it is significant for that reason, as well,

25

because the context in which Congress narrowed the reach
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of section 843(b) so that it only encompasses

2

facilitation of a felony and not facilitation of a

3

misdemeanor is one in which Congress in the 1970 act

4

sought to extend leniency and afford a chance at

5

rehabilitation to drug users.

6

And that's manifested not in legislative

7

history but in the statutory text itself, because

8

Congress penalized simple possession for personal use as

9

a misdemeanor, whereas, the receipt of drugs previously

10

was a felony, regardless of the purpose of the

11

possession, whether it was for use or for distribution.

12

But Congress did more than that, because in

13

immediately adjacent provisions to the one in which it

14

narrowed simple possession to a misdemeanor, it also

15

enacted a provision which is now found in 18 U.S.C.

16

3607, which allowed a simple possessor who is a

17

first-time offender to avoid any conviction at all if

18

they successfully complete a period of probation.

19

And Congress went further still because it

20

also enacted in another adjacent provision further

21

relief for first-time simple possessors under the age of

22

21.

23

to obtain a complete expungement of the criminal records

24

associated with the arrest.

25

With respect to that person, it allowed the person

So you would have

lost this case before 1970 because the incongruity on

2

which you rely -

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Well, the basis -- didn't exist

then?

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Yes.

Before 1970 it would

7

have been a very difficult climb because -- not only

8

because the communication facility applied to any drug

9

offense, but because simple possession wasn't a

10

misdemeanor.

11
12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

So the scope

of this language was changed sub silentio?

13
14

Right.

MR. SRINIVASAN:
silentio.

It -- it wasn't sub

It was explicit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know, but this

16

language, "facilitating," covered purchasers using a

17

telephone in the period before 1970, but not after 1970,

18

because of the changes in some other sections?

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, well, it's in part

20

because of the changes in this section.

21

changed from "any offense" to "felony," so it's the text

22

of this section itself.

23

equally applied in -- before 1970.

24

before 1970 you wouldn't have had to show that the buyer

25

was associated with the seller's felony, because the

This section

And the buyer-seller rule

23
Alderson Reporting Company

It's just that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

buyer was associated with his own offense and that was

2

enough, because at that point the buyer's offense was a

3

felony.

4

whether it was a felony because it applied to any drug

5

offense.

6

And then the law, section 843(b), didn't care

It's only after 1970 that this distinction

7

becomes important, because after 1970 it's clear that

8

the buyer for personal use doesn't use a phone in

9

committing a drug felony.

What he's committing is a

10

drug misdemeanor.

11

you're the government, to make him associated with the

12

drug felony.

13
14
15

So you have to find some way, if

And to say that -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That question goes

to whether or not the distribution was a felony.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Right, which is the only

16

avenue available after 1970.

There was a different

17

avenue available before 1970, because before 1970 a

18

purchaser of drugs would, if they used a phone in

19

connection with their purchase, would have used a phone

20

in connection with a drug offense, and now the statute

21

is different in two respects.

22

of a phone in connection with a drug felony; and two, in

23

another provision, Congress narrowed the simple

24

possession offense from a mis -- from a felony to a

25

misdemeanor.

One, it only covers use

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And Congress did so with respect to the

2

historical context in immediately adjacent provision.

3

It narrowed 843(b) in an immediately adjacent provision

4

to the one in which it provided that the simple

5

possessor could avoid any conviction at all and the one

6

in which it provided that a youthful offender could

7

obtain a complete expungement of its records.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -

You didn't -- I haven't

heard you question so far the government's rationale,

10

the reason Congress did this is it's more difficult to

11

detect a drug deal when it's by telephone than if it

12

were an encounter on the street or in an apartment.

13

have not questioned that?

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

You

No, we don't question that,

15

Your Honor, but I would like to make two points with

16

respect to that.

17

difficult -- the use of the telephone may be more

18

difficult, and that may be the animating purpose that

19

Congress sought to address through this provision.

20

that purpose is substantially served even in the context

21

of this case, because -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

you're saying.

24

difficult?

25

First of all, it may be more

I don't understand what

The use of a phone may be more

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Use of a phone may make

25
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

detection more difficult, and that may be the animating

2

purpose -- excuse me.

3

purpose behind the enactment of this provision.

4

that purpose is substantially served, even if you accept

5

our understanding of the statute on the facts of this

6

case, because the seller comes squarely within the terms

7

of section 843(b).

8

the terms of section 843(b), the statute is already

9

operating against the seller's use of a telephone.

10

That may have been the animating
But

So because the seller comes within

The question in our case is whether the

11

buyer also comes within the ambit of section 843(b).

12

And because section 843(b) presupposes someone who is

13

committing, facilitating or committing a drug felony,

14

the buyer doesn't come within the reach of section

15

843(b) because he's not committing, causing or

16

facilitating a drug felony in the first place.

17

seller may be, but the buyer is not.

18

purposes are still served by virtue of penalizing the

19

seller.

rebuttal.

15

MR. MILLER:

2

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

it doesn't matter who initiates the call?

5

MR. MILLER:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So what you're saying is

That's right.
Counsel, what do you do -

7

this case that I find pretty close to what we have here

8

is Rewis v. United States, which involved a statute that

9

prohibited interstate travel with the intent to, quote,

10

"promote, manage, establish, carry on or facilitate"

11

certain kinds of illegal activities, one of which would

12

have been gambling.

13

And we said the ordinary meaning of this

14

language suggests that the traveler's purpose must

15

involve more than the desire to patronize the illegal

16

activity.

17

gambling operation simply to be engaging in interstate

18

travel for the purpose of playing the tables.

19

So it wouldn't have been facilitating a

I think there are a couple

answers to that, Your Honor.

21

was construing the Travel Act.

22

word "facilitate," and it certainly didn't set out a

23

general -

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:
the word "facilitate."

First, Rewis, as you say,
It didn't focus on the

Oh, it certainly focused on

That was the whole purpose of
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that passage.

2

establish, carry on or facilitate," and the ordinary

3

meaning of this language suggests the traveler's purpose

4

must involve more than the desire to patronize the

5

illegal activity.

6

It said -- it quoted "promote, manage,

MR. MILLER:

That's right, and -- and as -

7

as indicated by the passage you've just quoted, the

8

focus of the Court there was on the traveler's purpose.

9

The Travel Act requires intent.

Section 843(b) is

10

different in that it's satisfied by knowingly or

11

intentionally using the phone.

12

So the Court in Rewis said, quite

13

reasonably, that someone whose only purpose is to be a

14

customer of an unlawful enterprise doesn't have the

15

intent to facilitate -- and significantly, although the

16

Court's quotation of the statute ends at "facilitate,"

17

it's not just to facilitate any unlawful activity; it's

18

to facilitate the promotion, management -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Don't you think that the

20

"knowingly" in this statute also requires that you are

21

knowingly facilitating?

22

MR. MILLER:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

It does require.
Okay.

So this is the same

thing here.
MR. MILLER:

But it doesn't have to be -- it
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doesn't have to be that you have the purpose of

2

facilitating the seller.

3

that the seller's -

4

It's sufficient that you know

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, this didn't

5

mention -- this statute didn't mention purpose, either,

6

did it?

7

MR. MILLER:

It -- it said "intent."

It

8

does not include the word "knowledge," and the Court in

9

the passage you just read construed that to require an

10

inquiry into the traveler's purpose.

11

It's also significant -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13
14

I find it pretty close, I

really do.
MR. MILLER:

Well, one other difference,

15

then, Your Honor, is that the facilitation that has to

16

take place under the Travel Act is facilitation of the

17

promotion, management, establishment or carrying on of

18

unlawful activity, which is defined not as a discrete

19

crime but as a business enterprise involving gambling.

20

So you have a statute that's focused on sort of

21

management or direction of an ongoing enterprise,

22

whereas here under 843(b), it's sufficient to facilitate

23

a discrete act.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why are you going through

all this sort of parsing, I mean, looking at the
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

legislative history as well as the statute in 1970?

2

What is your answer to the last point that they made,

3

that what Congress wanted to do was to make simple

4

possession a misdemeanor, that's why they changed the

5

word, which -- "offense" to "felony."

6

changed the word "felony" to "misdemeanor."

7

That's why they

And I can't imagine why else they amended

8

the statute, and just because I was curious I looked it

9

up, and that's why they amended it, right.

10

So -- so the

legislative history makes that clear.

11

So what you've done is figure out a way -

12

the government's figured out a way to do the opposite of

13

what they want, to take people who simply possess and

14

transform it into a felony.

15

there in the law for doing that?

16

MR. MILLER:

Now, what justification is

Well, I think there are a

17

couple of answers to that.

18

doesn't apply to people who simply possess.

19

to people who possess by using a phone to facilitate a

20

felony distribution.

21

existence of the statute demonstrates that Congress

22

thought that the use of a phone is a separate element

23

that introduces a distinct evil that Congress wanted to

24

combat.

25

First is that section 843(b)
It applies

And Congress -- I mean, the very

And as to the change in the felony language JUSTICE BREYER:

As to the first, I said

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

subset.

I didn't say you undermined the entire statute.

2

I said you took a subset of people who simply possessed

3

and that subset you transformed into felons.

4

response I guess is just what you said.

5

MR. MILLER:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. MILLER:

Now, your

Well, yes -- second.

-- and also that the reason for

8

the -- as you know, as you know, the predecessor to

9

843(b), which was section 1403, referred to causing or

10

facilitating any offense.

11

offenses were felonies.

12

"offense" to the word "felony."

13

reason for that.

14

specifically addressing the reason for that change.

15

part of the reason we can infer is that the 1970 statute

16

created a whole host of misdemeanors, of misdemeanor

17

regulatory offenses under the Controlled Substances Act.

18

So one good example is section 829, which prohibits

19

distributing a controlled substance without a

20

prescription, and that's an offense -- that's a

21

misdemeanor, and that could easily be caused or

22

facilitated over the phone, if somebody called a

23

pharmacist.

24
25

All of the enumerated
In 1970 they changed the word
But that's part of the

There is no legislative history
But

And so, where both parties to the
transaction are only engaging in a misdemeanor, that's
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

something that 843(b) would not apply to.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we do know that -

3

that Congress drew a line it hadn't drawn before between

4

the own-purpose users and people who were in the

5

trafficking business, and it expressed sympathy for

6

the -- or leniency, a policy of leniency.

7

But the difference between the

8

classification felony and misdemeanor is huge in terms

9

of consequences for a person's life.

So let's take the

10

defendant in this case.

11

than a misdemeanant, even if it's his first time and

12

it's only one gram, he loses a lot of rights, doesn't

13

he?

14

MR. MILLER:

If he becomes a felon rather

Yes.

Yes, that's right.

But I

15

-- and I think --

16

made to 843(b) in 1970 that's significant is that it

17

eliminated the mandatory minimum.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it may be that in

certain States voting rights are removed, and there is

3

on this person's record forever that he is a felon.

4

just seems odd that Congress would have at one and the

5

same time, the same statute, say, we want these -- to

6

give these people a chance and if they are in a

7

rehabilitation program and they make it they won't even

8

get any charge, not even a misdemeanor charge, and then

9

say, but a whole group of them are going to be treated

10
11

It

just like traffickers if they use a telephone.
It's hard -- these two would seem to be

12

working at odds with each other.

13

then try to reach some accommodation, some harmonization

14

of these two provisions?

15

that by saying facilitation, causing in this context

16

means the same thing as aiding and abetting, then we

17

have the buyer-seller rule for the aider and abettor,

and then we have made these two provisions harmonious.

MR. MILLER:

So mustn't the Court

And it's suggested that we do

I think the buyer-seller

20

principle and the limitation on aiding and abetting and

21

accessory liability, as this Court recognized in

the Court set out in that case, and it has been

recognized in subsequent cases, is that -- is that when

The second party who is left unpunished by the statute

Except that the use of a

you want us to similarly sweep in the facilitating of

Is there another example in

I'm asking -- which you've come across, where we have an

customer does is be a customer; and is there an example

9

where just because he's a customer in a statutory

provision that normally has a lesser penalty -- all

11

right; imagine those circumstances -- you still can

12

punish him as if he -- as if he ran the business?

I'm not aware of any, and I

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not aware, and why

should this be the first?

17

MR. MILLER:

But this -- this isn't one,

Because this isn't a case that punishes people just for

being a customer.

25

the other side thinks that, anyway, in terms of what

Congress thought, it's a tremendously big deal because

Congress was really worried about telephones.

This is a separate offense; it has its own penalty; it

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it -- can you tell me,

15

how does it work?

16

Attorney in one State, one district, has a case like

this where there are four different phone calls; and he

doesn't like the looks of the defendant, or for some

19

reason he can charge him, and in the neighboring

jurisdiction the United States Attorney does not.

there guidelines?

control this in each case?

23

we could see what the rules are for charging?

24

at the discretion of the United States Attorney?

25

The district -- the United States

Does the Department of Justice

MR. MILLER:

Is there some manual where

Yeah.

Is it all

I'm not aware of

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

anything in the U.S. Attorney's Manual that specifically

2

addresses this statute, but of course the Court

3

recognized in Batchelder that prosecutors legitimately

4

have discretion when there are different criminal

5

statutes that cover the conduct, and -

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the -- the

7

statement that in the manual -- maybe this is

8

incorrect -- but that the charging policy of the

9

Department of Justice instructs prosecutors to charge

10

the most serious offense supported by the facts?

11

that's true, then the Assistant U.S. Attorney would have

12

no choice.

13

simple possession, but it is the violation of 843(b).

14

The most serious offense is not misdemeanor

MR. MILLER:

That's if they bring charges at

15

all, and of course that policy doesn't require

16

prosecutors to -- to bring charges.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

And if

Ordinarily I think we know from this

case they're likely to bring charges.

20

MR. MILLER:

Well, I mean -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that the policy, first

22

of all?

It says that they're supposed to charge the

23

most serious offense supported by the facts?

24

MR. MILLER:

Yes, and -- and a -

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that means in every

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

one of these cases, whether the dealer picks up the

2

phone or the buyer picks up the phone for a transaction

3

for one gram of cocaine, the prosecutor has no choice

but to indict under 843(b)?

MR. MILLER:

Well, again, if -- if there is

to be an indictment at all.

There's no requirement that

15

MR. MILLER:

The

He cannot

He has to charge the

That's my understanding of the

policy, but, you know, this Court has recognized that,

17

you know, that sort of charging decision is a legitimate

18

aspect of the system as long as it's not exercised for

19

unconstitutional reasons.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but there's -- there's

21

a difference here, and that is, as these cases

22

illustrate, three phone calls for one trifling sale, two

23

for another, this gives a kind of multiplier effect

24

which it's -- it's hard to find a parallel for in the

25

law.

We go from a misdemeanor to 12 years, depending on
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the fact that there were -- there were a couple of cell

2

phone calls.

3

That is -- maybe -- maybe that is exactly

4

what Congress intended, and maybe that's good law

5

enforcement policy, but those are not sort of two

6

intuitively obvious positions.

7

MR. MILLER:

I think the -- the text of the

8

statute and the fact that it covers any act constituting

9

a felony does demonstrate that that's what Congress

10

intended as well -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. MILLER:

drugs using his phone knows that he is causing the

felony.

6

he wants to cause the dealer to send him drugs.

7

The reason he calls the drug dealer is because

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what about the

legislative history?

Because I would read it -- and in

9

fact what it seems to me that you're suggesting, when

10

you read the statute, is using a telephone is -- because

11

Justice Kennedy came up with a good example of what I

12

was thinking of.

13

well, that's different, he shouldn't have the gun, and

14

it's not surprising that he gets a higher sentence.

15

you're saying by reading the text you've discovered

16

Congress thinks that cell phones are sort of like guns.

17

Okay.

18

Justice Souter thinks it's not intuitively obvious, but

19

is there any legislative history that suggests that that

20

indeed is what people in Congress thought when they

21

passed this statute?

If the buyer sits there with a gun,

I grant you somebody might have thought that.

I'll read it if there is.

It's like carrying

So I'm asking you what would I read in this

MR. MILLER:

The legislative history of the

16

1956 act, which is the -- where the predecessor statute,

17

1403, was enacted, shows that Congress was concerned

18

with the ability of drug traffickers and people engaging

19

in drug transactions to avoid detection by using the

20

phone -

21
22
23

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's what -- you've

cited that in the brief so I can find it?
MR. MILLER:

Yes.

And the initial proposal

24

in the initial Senate bill would have allowed

25

wiretapping in connection with drug investigations of
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certain enumerated offenses that covered both purchasers

2

and sellers.

3

became 1403, which also -- which applied "causing or

4

facilitating" enumerated offenses, and again applied to

5

both buyers and sellers.

6

to buyers in a number of reported decisions before 1970,

7

and there is nothing in the 1970 legislative history

8

that Congress intended to change that aspect.

9

That was replaced with the provision that

And that statute was applied

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How does it work?

I

mean, I know your overall rationale about the ease of

11

detection -- easier to detect face to face encounter on

the streets.

14

government got the list of the people who bought from

15

the dealer.

16

17

But here, I mean, we know that the

How common is it that -- the either the

MR. MILLER:

I don't -- I don't know the

18

statistics on that, but certainly a wiretap is only

19

possible when demanding standards under Title III are

20

met, and -- whereas a face-to-face meeting can be

21

observed by anybody who happens to be there.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what had to be met in

23

this case in order to put this tap on the dealer's

24

phone?

25

MR. MILLER:

Well, among other things, I

believe the statute requires some showing that it's not

possible to obtain evidence in some other less intrusive

to be that.

statute, viewed keeping people from using the phones to

7

conceal their drug transactions as one way of minimizing

8

the need for more intrusive measures like wiretapping.

9

So in this case there was a wiretap on the

And certainly Congress, when it enacted the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, you would interpret

10

Congress -- now we're getting away from '56, when simple

11

possession was a felony, to '70, when simple possession

12

becomes a misdemeanor.

13

meant to relegate the simple possessor to misdemeanor

14

status, but only if the encounter was face to face.

15

you're reading into the -- what Congress did to sharply

16

distinguish between traffickers and users, and say but

17

that was only taking 843(b) into account.

18

-- that you're not going to be a felon; you're going to

19

be a misdemeanant -- is only for face-to-face

20

MR. MILLER:

But I'm talking about

occasion, nothing more.

3

MR. MILLER:

4

As a first offense.

I mean,

that -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So Congress's design was

6

we treat as a less grave offender the buyer for his own

7

use, but only if he buys in a face-to-face encounter.

8

That's what -- what you would have to read -- you would

9

have to limit the line Congress drew between

10

traffickers, on the one hand, and possessors for their

11

own use, on the other, that it applies only to drugs

12

purchased in face-to-face encounters.

13

MR. MILLER:

Yes, although I wouldn't

14

describe it as an issue of a less grave offense or a

15

more grave offense in the sense that the use of the

16

phone aggravates the offense of possession.

is an enormous difference.

MR. MILLER:

That -- that's right.

But

Congress, again, did recognize that there could be a
48
Alderson Reporting Company

range of levels of culpability associated with the

2

843(b) offense, which is part of the reason that it

3

eliminated the mandatory minimum when it amended the

statute in 1970, suggesting that there could be

5

different kinds of conduct that would satisfy it.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Miller, in answer to

7

one of Justice Breyer's earlier questions, he -- the

8

premise of his question was the effect of the twin

9

amendments from offense to felony and from felony to

10

misdemeanor for possession of small quantities.

11

said, well, in effect, is that combination of amendments

really being rendered nugatory by the view that you take

of the statute?

apply there.

MR. MILLER:

Is that really a significant

I -- I don't know how many

prosecutions are brought under those statutes.

imagine that, in part because they are misdemeanors, not

a lot of prosecutions.

many misdemeanor-misdemeanor combined offenses are there

think it is on the order of a dozen or so, and then we

cite a couple of them in our brief.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You -- you don't have any

figures on the number of actual prosecutions under -

under the -- in the misdemeanor-misdemeanor combination

4

cases?

5

MR. MILLER:

No.

I mean, again, because -

6

because they're misdemeanors and prosecutorial resources

7

are probably concentrated on the more serious felony

8

violations of the Controlled Substances Act, I suspect

9

there aren't a lot of prosecutions.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So -- well, then, I guess

11

that leads to my last question, and that is:

12

probably true that if we accept your view of the

13

statute, then the effect of those two combined

14

amendments, offense to -- to felony, felony to

15

misdemeanor for small quantities, the -- the combined

16

effect of -- of those two statutes is, in effect,

rendered worthless in -- in most cases?

it would render those -- those two amendments, in

relevant inquiry is:

inquiry, but what about my irrelevant inquiry?

2

MR. MILLER:

Well, I -

3

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's going to -- your -

5

your view of the statute is going to render those two

6

amendments virtually dead letters?

7

MR. MILLER:

I mean I -- I think -- I think

8

from the perspective of -- of Congress, that there was

9

no -- they wouldn't have anticipated that the amendment

10

would not have any consequence.

11

that they created this whole set of misdemeanors, the

12

fact that they aren't violated very often -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I mean the fact that -

As you said, you -- you

don't have figures on the number of prosecutions.

15

the number of prosecutions under those misdemeanors, as

16

distinct from the number of applications of the

communications statute to conventional buyer/seller

18

transactions is probably the difference between a very

19

small set and a very large set of cases.

very large set of cases the two amendments are being

rendered, in effect, worthless; isn't that true?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
The only point I would make in closing,

8

unless the Court has further questions for us, is that

9

we think the statutory text, the statutory history, and

10

the context all weigh in favor of our reading.

11

if there is any ambiguity on the matter, principles of

12

lenity would squarely apply in foreclosing an

13

interpretation that converts someone who is a

14

misdemeanant into someone who is exposed to multiple

15

felony counts carrying substantial criminal

16

consequences.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But even

May I ask this question as

18

just a matter of history?

19

think you said that the -- the presence of the use of

the telephone was not just a jurisdictional hook.

21

Because back in 1970 the Federal Government really

22

wasn't in the criminal law business the way it has

23

become in the last 30 or 40 years.

24
25

Is it perfectly clear?

I

At that time there was a lot of concern, the
Travel Act and other statutes, about exactly what the
53

Federal justification for -- justification for Federal

2

participation existed.

impression that that was really what was behind the

4

telephone aspect of this statute.

5

And I -- I always had the

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't think so, Justice

6

Stevens, because as of 1970 there were already

7

underlying drug laws that barred distribution, that

8

barred receipt of drugs, and that barred most of the

9

activities that are now prohibited under the drug laws.

10

And the telephone law presupposes that one of those

11

underlying acts is already going on.

12

And so to the extent that there was

13

jurisdiction over those underlying acts, which

14

presumably there was since the statutes are on the

15

books, the Telephone Act wasn't necessary to create

16

jurisdiction.

But as far as the buyer/seller rule -- Gebardi and Rewis

21

are concerned, what if the statute said -- made it a

22

crime for -- for a person to use a machine gun in

23

facilitating the commission of a felony?

24

-- you would have to say that the buyer/seller rule and

25

those authorities would mean that that person could not
54

Would you say

be prosecuted if they were using the machine gun to

2

facilitate a -- a purchase for personal use; would you

3

not?

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think the -- the

5

use of the machine gun wouldn't come within the

6

buyer/seller rule because what the buyer/seller rule

7

deals with is a substantive prohibition on distribution.

8

And the -- the presumption is that when Congress

9

prohibits distribution, it knows that there is also a

10

receiver of the banned substance.

11

excluding that receiver from the distribution

12

prohibition, it wouldn't have wanted to bring that

13

receiver back within the fold of the statute.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. SRINIVASAN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. SRINIVASAN:

And by virtue of

Right, but That wouldn't apply I'm sorry.

Go ahead.

I was just going to say I

18

don't think that would apply with somebody who is using

19

a machine gun because the person who is using a machine

20

gun isn't necessarily part of the distribution offense

21

to begin with.

22

apply with respect to the underlying purchase of drugs

23

if that were at issue.

24

machine gun, I don't think the buyer/seller principle

25

would speak directly to that.

And so the buyer/seller principle would

But if you tack on use of a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't -- I don't see

2

the difference between use of a phone to facilitate -

3

use of a phone in facilitating, use of -- of a firearm

4

in facilitating, unless you can say that the -- the use

5

of a communication facility in effecting the purchase is

6

such a -- a virtually indispensable element of the

7

purchase that it -- it -- it's swept up within it.

8
9

MR. SRINIVASAN:
Alito.

Oh, no, I'm sorry, Justice

If the hypothetical statute barred use of a

10

phone in facilitating a drug felony, if it was precisely

11

parallel to this one, then we make the same argument.

12

But it's not because the use of a machine gun falls

13

within the buyer/seller principle.

14

underlying act of purchasing drugs falls within the

15

buyer/seller principle.

16

use of a machine gun in some underlying act, then you

17

have to look at the underlying act.

18

act is governed by the buyer/ seller principle, and

19

buyers fall outside of it.

20

gun by someone who is already outside of the act

21

wouldn't bring the buyer back into the fold of the

22

statute.

23
24
25

It's because the

And if the prohibition is on

And the underlying

And so the use of a machine

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the answer is that this

-- it would be the same.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

It would be the same -

JUSTICE ALITO:

The buyer/seller rule would

apply in your view in exactly the same way.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

If the -- if the statute -

4

if I understand your hypothetical correctly, if the

5

statute were use of a phone in facilitating a drug

6

felony, then the -

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it could be a -- a

8

separate crime, the use of a machine gun in facilitating

9

-- in facilitating a crime, any crime.

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Sure.

If that were the

11

case, then it would be different.

12

finish for a minute, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

That could be -

My -- if I could just

My -- my only point is that if the theory of

14

prosecution were that a person comes within the fold of

15

the statute because they're buying drugs and that buying

16

of drugs facilitates the sale of drugs and, therefore,

17

they are someone who uses a machine gun in facilitating

18

the sale of drugs, well, then the buyer/seller rule

19

would kick in.

20

theory, which is that the person is facilitating the

sale by buying, wouldn't work.
