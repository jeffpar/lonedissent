CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 07-544, Hedgpeth versus Pulido.

Mr. Friedlander.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY FRIEDLANDER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Respondent has agreed with us that the ninth

11

circuit was wrong when it said that the error here and

12

the one in Stromberg were structural defects.

13

The remaining question is whether Respondent

14

can salvage the Stromberg rule by making it part of a

15

proper harmless error test as he attempted to do.

16

His harmless error test is wrong for several

17

reasons, but the Stromberg part of it was wrong for

18

basically one reason.

19

a rule of harmless error, and it is not even a correct

20

rule of error.

21

He makes the Stromberg rule into

This Court has defined "instructional error"

22

to require not merely a mistake in instruction, but a

23

reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law.

24

So when Respondent says, invoking Stromberg, that to

25

instruct the jury on valid and invalid theories is
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

harmless error if the jury adopted a valid theory, what

2

Respondent is saying is nothing more than that no error

3

occurred in the first place.

4

everything it needed to find in order to convict and,

5

therefore, did not misapply the law.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Because the jury found

Do that again, will you?
We need to have a

8

reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law.

9

That's how we get to error.

Respondent invokes

10

Stromberg to say if the jury is instructed a right way

11

and a wrong way and they went the right way, we have

12

harmless error.

13

No.

What we really have is no error at all.

14

Because there is the -- the jury did not misapply the

15

law.

16

error.

17

jury could have misapplied the law.

18

Moreover, Stromberg is not even a correct rule of
Because under Stromberg you have error if the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can I interrupt you?

You

19

are saying no error occurred, and on page 11 of your

20

brief you say, "An unconstitutional instructional error

21

occurred in this case because there was a reasonable

22

likelihood the jury found," and so forth and so on.

23

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Yes.

I agree that error

24

occurred in this case.

What I'm trying to argue here is

25

that Respondent is entirely off base in importing the
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Stromberg rule into a harmless error determination.

2

Stromberg is, at most, a rule of error.

3

the wrong way.

4

even a correct rule of error because under Stromberg you

5

say, could the jury have gone the wrong way; whereas,

6

under this Court's modern precedent you have to have a

7

reasonable likelihood that the jury -

8

10

That is a rule of error, but it is not

JUSTICE STEVENS:
happened here.

The jury went

But you said that's what

That's what your brief says.

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Yes.

I agree that there

11

was an error here but not because of Stromberg.

12

this was a reasonable likelihood that the jury

13

misapplied the law.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because

But you should have said

15

"no" to the question, I think.

16

question -- whatever it was, you are saying that there

17

isn't a reasonable likelihood that its error influenced

18

the outcome.

Because I thought the

You are not saying that?

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

There is a reasonable

20

likelihood that the jury misapplied the law.

21

error question.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

That's the

Yes.
Then the harmless error

24

question is:

Given that they misapplied the law, do we

25

know under the requisite degree of certainty -5

2

have found him guilty of felony murder under a proper

3

instruction?

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you agree that the

5

California Supreme Court gave an incorrect explanation

6

to the answer to that question?

7

harmless error because the -- the jury made a specific

8

finding that rebutted that, and that finding depended on

9

the difference between the word "and" and "or."

10

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

They said there was no

I'm not sure I followed

11

the last part of the question, but I agree with you if

12

what you are saying is that the California Supreme

13

Court, in effect, applied a Stromberg-like test.

14

said "necessarily resolved."

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

They

I'm -- I'm

16

questioning the basis for the Supreme Court's conclusion

17

that the error was harmless.

18

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Their basis for the

19

conclusion was the jury's "special circumstance"

20

finding.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Right.

22

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Now, they did not

23

consider, when they made that "special" -- when they

24

interpreted that "special circumstance," the "and/or"

25

mistake that was embedded in the instructions.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Which meant that the jury

2

really hadn't answered the question they thought it had

3

answered.

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

No, it didn't mean that.

5

We don't agree with that.

6

a correct interpretation of the instruction.

7

We don't believe that that is

But let me skip past that if you'll allow

8

me.

Even if you -- even if you accent any meaning from

9

that "special circumstance" finding -- and we don't

10

agree with that but even if you did -- you had at a

11

minimum here the nature -

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If you do that, you are

13

removing the basis for the California Supreme Court's

14

decision.

15

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Well -

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is that not right?

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

decision, yes, I think that's right.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

All right.

3

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Okay.

4
5

But it doesn't

matter because we are going to apply Brecht anyway.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you clarify the -- the

6

category of cases that would be affected if your

7

argument is accepted?

8

be -- would not be harmless under Brecht if it had a

9

substantial or -- or injurious effect, right?

There would be -- an error would

10

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

True.
Now, what is the standard

12

under California law for submitting a theory of

13

liability to the jury?

14

some evidence in support of it.

15

Presumably, you have to have

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

I'm not sure I understand

16

the question.

17

whether there is error in the first place in submitting

18

a factually unsupported theory.

19

I think that goes to the question of

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you are -- you are

20

arguing that there are instances in which, when a theory

21

of liability is submitted to the jury, the error -- and

22

it's erroneous -- the error can be harmless.

23

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

Yes.
Correct?

Now, what are the

-- what is the standard under California law for
8
Alderson Reporting Company

submitting the theory of liability to the jury in the

2

first place?

3

to be some evidence in support of that, right?

4

much?

5

You have to have -- presumably, there has

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

How

I don't think -- I don't

6

think I know the answer to that question.

It would

7

certainly be error under California State law if there

8

is a reasonable -- if they have the same reasonable

9

likelihood standard that the Federal courts have, if

10

there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury

11

misapplied the law.

12

Now, in a -- but you seem to be focusing on

13

an evidentiary sufficiency, and I think that's governed

14

by Griffith where if you -- if you have an insufficient

15

-- if you have insufficient evidence to support the

16

theory, then it's inappropriate -

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

What I'm asking is:

When is

18

there going to be a case in which a theory of liability

19

is submitted to the jury and it's -- and it's erroneous

20

-- multiple theories are submitted; one erroneous.

21

yet it would turn out that the submission of the

22

erroneous theory did not have a substantial or injurious

23

effect.

24
25

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

And

This one -- this case -

this case was submitted to the jury on two alternative

Alderson Reporting Company

1

theories:

2

abetting; one of them incorrect, post-killing aiding and

3

abetting.

4

effect because we know that at an absolute minimum here

5

the jury found that the defendant acted -- aided and

6

abetted robbery with reckless indifference to human life

7

and was a major participant in the robbery.

8

findings were not compatible with post-killing aiding

9

and abetting.

10

One of them correct, pre- killing aiding and

And it didn't have a substantial injurious

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And those

I thought there was -

11

that there was this -- there were three possibilities,

12

and one was that the defendant didn't do anything

13

before, didn't do anything during, but was simply an

14

accessory after the fact.

15

If the jury believed that, then there was no

16

way it could convict him of the crime that he was

17

convicted of.

18
19
20
21
22

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Well, the jury rejected

accessory after the fact but JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do we know that?

Was

there a special verdict?
MR. FRIEDLANDER:

They were instructed on

23

accessory after the fact as the lesser offense and they

24

found in essence robbery and felony murder.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They found the greater

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

offense, so there would have been no need for them to go

2

to the lesser included offense.

3

I think the problem that we are having is that in

4

finding the greater offense, they may have done so under

5

a theory of accomplice liability that was consistent

6

with the accomplice simply coming in at a late stage in

7

the proceedings.

8

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10
11

Your trouble is -- and

Yes.

That's right.

I mean, that's the

difficulty we are having.
MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Yes.

There is a

12

reasonable likelihood that in deciding felony murder

13

they failed to decide that he engaged in the robbery

14

before the killing.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Right.
However, they went and

17

found the special circumstance in which they found

18

reckless, aiding and abetting with reckless indifference

19

to human life and as a major participant.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I thought the, the

21

difficulty with using that as a means of answering the

22

first error was that the way the special circumstance

23

instruction was phrased, they could have found the

24

special circumstance without finding anything more than

25

that he came in at a late stage.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

No.

That's not correct.

2

I don't believe that's correct.

3

the instruction, that and/or difficulty, focused on a

4

different question, a different point, said that if you

5

-- if they -- I'm blanking out but -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

It is true that part of

The second -- go ahead.
It didn't address the

8

reckless indifference to human life and the major

9

participant, but that was embedded in the instructions,

10

and from the start the courts that have looked at this

11

and have reached this question have all agreed that

12

there was a jury finding of reckless indifference to

13

human life and major participant, and they have

14

disagreed as to what it might have meant.

15

the U.S. district court -

1

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

No.

The special -

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I thought that was what

3

the California Supreme Court relied on?

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I agree with Justice

5

Stevens.

6

and the "and" is the problem for you.

7

I thought that was the whole problem, the "or"

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

8

14.

9

was -- was mistaken:

The -- I'll read from JA

This is the special circumstance instruction that
"The murder was committed while

10

the defendant was engaged in the commission or attempted

11

commission of a robbery, or the murder was committed in

12

order to carry out or advance the commission of the

13

crime of robbery, et cetera."

14

Now, that -- that finding alone we agree if

15

you -- if you -- if you just follow that finding, that

16

doesn't implicate the defendant.

17

at JA 13, the instruction, JA 13:

18

reckless indifference to human life and as a major

19

participant aided and abetted in the commission of a

20

robbery which resulted in the death of Flores."

9

Help me out here.

One possibility

And the other instructions

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

No.

The -- the problem

with the, I think you're mixing up two things here.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

I may be doing that.
The felony murder

12

instructions did not speak to this question of

13

contemporaneity.

14

We acknowledge that that was error.

15

arguably find felony murder, aiding and abetting felony

16

murder based on post- killing aiding and abetting.

17

the jury has to get to the special circumstance finding,

18

right?

They left it open.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

That was error.
Okay?

So they

Now,

Yes.
And now it has to decide,

21

among other things, as I -- as I read to you, "did he

22

aid and abet robbery with reckless indifference to human

23

life and as a major participant in the commission of a

24

robbery which resulted in the death of Flores?"

25

at JA 13.

So what we 14

must have assisted prior to -

4

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

7

It doesn't.

It doesn't

say that.

5
6

Where does it say that he

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then that doesn't cure the

error.
MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Yes, it does, and the

8

reason that it does is because the harmless error test

9

is not whether the jury actually made the finding that

10

it needed to make; rather, the harmless error test is do

11

we know from the evidence and from the findings that the

12

jury would have made the findings that it was required

13

to make had it been properly instructed?

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me that

15

you're arguing one of two things:

16

no error at all under Stromberg; or second, that if

17

there was error, it was harmless error.

18

the case was about whether or not the Ninth Circuit

19

erred in concluding that harmless error analysis didn't

20

apply to a Stromberg error.

21

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

First, that there was

Yes.

And I thought

I'm not arguing the

22

first point.

I -- I concede there was error.

I just

23

wanted to make the point that Stromberg itself is an

24

incorrect rule of error.

25

us down a path that I didn't need to go down.

But I can see that that's led

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, we are certainly arguing harmless

2

error.

As for the Ninth Circuit's opinion, we said -

the Ninth Circuit said this is structural error.

structural error.

10

No, it did not.

And -

This is trial error, not

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if we were to say,

11

Ninth Circuit, you were wrong, but the district court

12

was right -

13

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

Well, the district court

14

was right to the extent that it found it to be trial

15

error.

16

be prejudicial trial error.

17

with us that this is not structural error, that we need

18

to do a harmless error analysis, and what Respondent has

19

done is import into this harmless error analysis we are

20

saying the Stromberg rule; and it doesn't belong there.

21

It was wrong to the extent that it found it to

The Stromberg rule is not a proper rule of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

2

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

4
5
6

MR. SHAH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think the Chief Justice framed the main

7

issue in this case properly.

Consistent with the last

8

two decades of this Court's instructional error

9

jurisprudence, the Court should hold that the type of

10

error at issue is not structural and is subject to

11

harmless error review.

12

The Ninth Circuit's contrary interpretation

13

of Stromberg creates the untenable result that adding an

14

invalid theory -- adding a valid theory to an invalid

15

one somehow makes the error worse.

16

rejects that interpretation.

17

should reverse the Ninth Circuit and remand for

18

application of harmless error review under Brecht.

19

The main issue -

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21
22

Even Respondent now

It follows that this Court

That's what the district

judge did, right?
MR. SHAH:

Yes, Your Honor.

The district

23

court did apply harmless error review under Brecht.

24

court of appeals, of course, did not.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

It could just review the

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

district court's decision using the standards that the

2

district court used?

3

MR. SHAH:

This Court could do that, but the

4

longstanding and customary practice of this Court is

5

that when the court of appeals does not address the

6

harmless error question, that it remands to that court.

7

It did that in Rose V. Clark, in Pope V. Illinois and

8

California V. Roy, and more recently in Recuenco.

9

And in several of those cases the

10

intermediate court or the district court, in the habeas

11

context, did address it and the court of appeals didn't

12

in all of those cases that the Court did remand for

13

application of harmless error.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I wasn't questioning

15

that.

The issue, is the United States position say

16

structural error was wrong, harmless error was right,

17

and then just have the Ninth Circuit review the district

18

court's decision that held that there was harmless error

19

the way it would ordinarily review a district court

20

decision?

21

MR. SHAH:

Yes, Your Honor, but I would add

22

that this Court should also clarify the scope of that

23

harmless error inquiry.

24

principles.

25

narrower form of harmless error review in this case than

I think there are two important

There is no logical reason to apply a

the Court did in Neder.

2

So I think that this Court should clarify

3

that the principles of harmlessness articulated in Neder

4

should apply on remand to the Ninth Circuit.

5

those of those principles bear mention.

6

I think

First, the question is not what the jury

7

actually or necessarily found, but rather, it

8

encompasses what a rationale jury would have found

9

absent the error.

10

And I think the second important point for

11

this Court to clarify is that harmlessness review is not

12

limited to cases, is not limited to cases where the

13

relevant elements are undisputed, but rather even when

14

disputed, a reviewing court should consider the entire

15

record and determine whether, in light of the jury

16

finding, there is sufficient evidence to support a

17

contrary verdict.

Honor, to the court of appeals to apply those

19

principles.

And then it should remand, Your

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do you say in light of

that verdict that at a minimum, the jury found that

13

The jury was instructed on that

So I don't think that the -- that the

14

inquiry should take place in a vacuum, but, of course,

15

the reviewing court should have the benefit of the

16

limited jury findings that we do know were made, and

17

then apply the sufficiency inquiry in light of those

18

jury findings.

19

findings that were made.

20

There is no reason to disregard the jury

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Suppose it's not, in

21

the abstract anyway, necessarily true that this case

22

follows a fortiori, because here, at least you have a

23

valid theory.

24

the jury had based its entire verdict on an invalid

25

theory.

That may make it a harder case, because

21
Alderson Reporting Company

1

It may be more difficult than a situation

2

where you've got a theory of the case that is invalid

3

because a particular element is missing.

4

look and see whether or not that was harmless or not.

5

MR. SHAH:

And you can

I would disagree, Mr. Chief

6

Justice.

I think there are two possibilities in a case

with alternative theories.

One possibility is that the

11

then this case is no different than Neder, no better, no

12

worse, right.

13

If that's what the jury had done,

The other possibility, however, is that the

14

jury relies on the completely valid theory.

15

relied on the completely valid theory, then there is

16

even less of a problem than Neder.

17

at all.

18

If the jury

There is no problem

So I don't see how the error in this

19

alternative valid theory and defense theory circumstance

20

could be any -

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The difference is when you

22

only got one theory, you know what he relied on.

23

you got alternatives, how do you know which one he

24

relied on?

MR. SHAH:

When

Well, you don't -- you don't,
22

Alderson Reporting Company

2

decide.

3

that the jury relied on the defective theory, then we

4

are in the same box as in Neder, and the reviewing court

5

would decide whether there was -- you know, they would

6

apply the harmless error review to the missing element

7

and decide whether there was sufficient evidence to

8

render that error harmless; or the court could ask,

9

well, is that uncontraverted or overwhelming evidence

10

that the defendant would have been found guilty under

11

the valid theory.

12

14

And that's what the reviewing court has to

But in either scenario, if it -- if you assume

inquiry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess,

15

though, the point is when you have invalid and valid

16

theories, it would be a little harder than Neder,

17

because they don't have to make any findings under the

18

valid theory.

different puzzle.

23

conceivable cases there is going to be at least some

overlap between -- between the two theories.

And what

know that when the jury has returned a general verdict

2

of guilt, they have necessarily found beyond a

reasonable doubt that each of those elements has been

4

satisfied.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

But in this case the

6

question is whether the uncle did it or the nephew did

7

it.

8

there is substantial reason to believe maybe it was the

9

uncle, they might have taken the easy case out.

10

And if there is a lot of doubt about -- about -- if

I think

this is vastly different from a single theory case.

11

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your honor, here's why -

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because it's an -- there

13

is plenty of evidence that he might have been guilty

14

after the fact.

15

there is doubt about the former.

16

MR. SHAH:

There is no doubt about that.

But

Your Honor, here's why I think

17

the cases aren't that different, because, you know, at a

18

minimum from the general verdict of guilt if you take a

19

case like this, you know that the jury found that there

20

MR. SHAH:

It is possible that the jury

would have found that, and that's the question that the

3

reviewing court would perform in harmless error review,

4

just like if there -- basically that is the exact same

5

question the Court would form, would do under Neder if

6

the timing element were omitted all together.

7

reviewing court would look at the evidence and decide is

8

there sufficient evidence to support an after-the-fact

9

participation.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

So what we are

11

talking about, in other words, is the application of

12

harmless error, which may or may not be harder in the

13

multiple theory case, and not the question of whether

14

harmless error analysis should be applied.

15

MR. SHAH:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's going to

16

be completely fact dependent whether it's harder or not.

17

But I think analytically it's exactly the same as in

18

Neder.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Aren't there going to be

20

cases in which there's enough evidence to support the

21

submission of a theory of liability to the jury, but so

22

little that the court is going to be able to say that

23

it's harmless under -- that the submission of the

24

invalid theory was harmless under Brecht?

25

MR. SHAH:

Yes.

I mean, you can image in a

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case -- take Neder.

2

omitting the materiality element, was submitted to the

3

jury certainly enough evidence to support it, and then

4

there was another valid theory -

5

By this Neder instruction, the one

JUSTICE ALITO:

There is difference.

An

6

element of the defense has to be submitted to the jury.

7

And it may be that that it's -- the element is

8

undisputed, but a theory of liability isn't going to be

9

submitted to the jury unless there is some evidence to

10
11

support it.
MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, if -- if there

12

is some evidence to support it, if we were in a direct

13

review context, that's the inquiry that Neder says.

14

on a clean slate it might be that if there is sufficient

15

evidence to support a contrary verdict, that that would

16

end the inquiry.

17

So

But in many of these cases we are going to

18

know that the jury has made at least some findings, has

19

found some of the elements.

20

harmless error inquiry, just like in this as we know

21

that the jury has found things like a respondent was a

22

major participant, exhibited a reckless disregard for

23

human life, discounted a significant portion of this -

24

of his statement by rejecting the duress defense.

MR. O'CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

8

Unlike the Sarausad case argued earlier this

9

morning, this is a case of conceded constitutional error

10

under the reasonable likelihood standard, the same

11

question that consumed so much of the Sarausad argument.

12

We acknowledge that this is a trial error

and is subject to the Brecht prejudice standard.

argument, in a Brecht situation, the defendant wins the

MR. O'CONNELL:

Your Honor, although the

Ninth Circuit admittedly used a structural defect

4

nomenclature with which we don't agree, we believe that

5

the Court can't -- that upon considering both the Ninth

6

Circuit decision and the district court decision, this

7

Court can affirm because the inquiry which the Ninth

8

Circuit did conduct was actually a case-specific

9

inquiry, not really a structural defect inquiry, and

10

when an examination of the evidence and the verdicts and

11

the instructions and anything else indicative of the

jury's thinking still leaves the court uncertain whether

the jurors relied on the valid or the invalid theory,

answer to that question is in the underlying trial

24

The district attorney developed the theme quite

25

effectively that, even under Mr. Pulido's own account,

which the district attorney came back again, though

somewhat less dramatically, at 1330 of the transcript

and again at 1337 to 1338, commenting that he -- that

Mr. Pulido did not go back in at some later point to

12

check on the victim's condition, that entire line of

argument that if the Court -- if the Court is convinced

that the Ninth Circuit's analysis in substance -

because I realize the nomenclature -- the nomenclature

23

was inconsistent with harmless error, and I'm not going

24

to defend that.

25

substance of the Ninth Circuit's analysis was so far

If the Court is convinced that the

personally shot the victim and that, in the prosecutor's

3

words, Aragon had nothing to do with this, Aragon wasn't

4

there, Aragon isn't a murderer.

5

We also know -- and this will be another

6

echo of the Sarausad case -- we also know that

7

throughout their five days of deliberations, the jurors

8

submitted question after question directed to what are

now -- what are concededly defective erroneous

instructions, and moreover, those questions focused

11

right in on the defect in the instructions and in

particular the timing of Mr. Pulido's assistance.

And I refer the Court in particular to the

jurors' handwritten diagrams of alternative conceptions

of felony-murder aiding and abetting liability, which

are at 36 to 38 of the joint appendix, and also the

found a set of facts corresponding to the invalid late

5

joiner theory, because in my view what -- the analysis

6

the Ninth Circuit conducted gets us to a point of

equipoise, and that's enough for Brecht.

8

the Ninth Circuit's analysis is they neglected to also

factor in those juror queries, and in my view the juror

The defect in

10

queries move us from a state of equipoise to a very high

11

probability that the jurors relied on the -- and adopted

12

a factual scenario corresponding to an invalid theory.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under Brecht, you

14

have the burden of showing a substantial injurious

15

effect.

16

MR. O'CONNELL:

Well, actually, Your Honor,

17

as understand O'Neal the Court specifically renounced

18

describing it as a burden, and in fact said that we are

19

not going to use the "burden" terminology, and rather

20

than talk about allocating burdens, we are going to

21

address it from the perspective of the judge and say, if

22

the judge is in equipoise, that is sufficient.

23

We also know that -- drawing upon the

24

relationship between the Brecht standard and others, we

25

know that a Strickland standard is deemed to -- that if

you have Strickland prejudice, you don't have to go

2

through a separate Brecht analysis.

3

Strickland, reasonable probability also satisfies

4

Brecht's substantial and injurious influence.

this Court has said again and again, in construing

Strickland, it does not require a more likely than not

showing; it simply requires a showing sufficient to

undermine confidence in the outcome.

rather strongly that those standards are either

equivalent or to the extent that they differ, the

Now that

means two things.

From a retrospective point of view of

analysis is entirely consistent with a Kotteakos type

perspective implications, because if this Court were to

7

wholly disavow that type of analysis and say that has

8

nothing to do with harmless error review, that's going

9

to impact civil cases, too; and obviously in all this

10

Court's opinions, the Court is considering not only the

11

immediate case, but what is going to happen if we -- if

12

we rule one way or another.

13

So this case -- this case supports a finding

14

of prejudice under that O'Neal equipoise and as for the

15

Ninth Circuit did, that's not what it called it, it even

16

more strongly supports prejudice when one factors in the

17

rest of the record, notably the juror -- the juror

18

queries and another item which I think may be responsive

19

to some of Justice Alito's earlier questions, which is

20

the strength of the evidence on the various theories.

21

There were three theories and obviously

22

there was evidence in support of the prosecution's main

23

theory that Pulido shot the victim himself.

24

evidence -- obviously there was substantial evidence in

25

the form of Pulido's own testimony in support of the
37
Alderson Reporting Company

There was

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

invalid late-joiner theory.

Out of these the one theory

2

that had least support in the record before the jury was

3

the valid aiding and abetting theory, because no witness

4

testified to a scenario in which Pulido assisted in some

5

fashion or another prior to the shooting; nor did the

6

prosecutor attempt to develop that type of scenario in

7

argument because the prosecutor was very clear:

8

Prosecutor said you're going to get aiding and abetting

9

instructions just in case.

They only apply -- if -

10

they only come into play if you were to believe the

11

defendant's story which was a real whopper; but if you

12

believe the defendant's story the felony murder rule

13

applies.

14

But then the prosecutor immediately went

15

back, "but I don't think it applies at all, Aragon

16

wasn't there.

17

prosecutor went back to his primary theory.

Aragon didn't do it.

Pulido did it," and

18

So the theory which the -- present in the

19

instructions was least before the jury, was the valid

20

aiding and abetting theory, yet defining this conceded

21

error harmless depends on the notion either that the

22

jury actually adopted a pre-shooting aiding or abetting

23

or that they necessarily would have adopted one if

24

properly instructed.

25

There is one final point I'd like to make,
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which is there is a qualitative aspect to Brecht; and

2

when one has an error under which the defense testimony

3

even if believed renders the defendant guilty

4

erroneously, that derails the entire defense.

5

seems to me is the quintessential substantial and

6

injurious influence; because it practically renders the

7

trial nullity by erroneously telling the jury even if

8

you find this set of facts, the defendant is guilty.

9

That it

So for these reasons and additionally for

10

the very thorough prejudice analysis found in the

11

district court opinion, we urge the Court to affirm,

12

despite the Ninth Circuit's inept nomenclature, but in

13

the event the Court is dissatisfied with that

14

explanation, we have acknowledged that the appropriate

15

course in that instance would be to send it back under

16

Brecht.

MR. FRIEDLANDER:

We agree that we need to

2

do Brecht.

3

is telling you that Brecht is the error test, whether

4

the jury relied on the valid or invalid theory.

5

what he says Brecht is.

6

Court said there is a difference between the error test

7

and the harmless error test.

8
9

We disagree on what Brecht is.

Respondent

That's

In Calderon v Coleman, this

All these questions that the jury asked went
to the question of error.

Did the jury misapply the law

10

by failing to find a contemporaneity aspect of felony

11

murder?

12

of what the jury would have done had it been properly

13

instructed.

14

They did not go to the harmless error question

We urge the Court in remanding the case to

15

make clear that the error analysis must be kept separate

16

from the harmless error analysis.

17

Judge Thomas made in his concurring opinion.

18

assumes -- he sees a mistake in an instruction; he

19

assumes that the mistake rises to the level of

20

constitutional error; and then he does a prejudice

21

analysis by deciding whether the mistake caused the jury

22

to misapply the law.

23

an error analysis to decide prejudice.

24

is he includes all this evidence of the questions the

25

jury asked when those questions went only to the
