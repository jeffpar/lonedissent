ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
A father forced at gunpoint to engage in

12

incest with his daughter because of his religion, race,

13

or political views, and told that he and his daughter

14

will be killed if he refuses, is far outside the class

15

of persons brought to mind by the ordinary meaning of

16

the phrase at issue in this case, which is reprinted on

17

page 1 of our brief, quoting from section (a)(42):

18

person who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise

19

participated in the persecution of any person" on

20

account of a prohibited factor.

21

"Any

The same is true if -- of someone who, as

22

part of the religious persecution directed against him,

23

is forced on threat of death to disrupt a prayer meeting

24

and injure his co-religionists.

25

co-religionists are victims of persecution.

The father and the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

They would

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not be described in ordinary parlance as "persecutors."

2

And we think that that really under the Government's

3

view, the persecutor bar turns solely on what they term

4

"objective effect of an individual's acts."

5

means that the act need not be accompanied by any of the

6

indicia of moral offensiveness that the law typically

7

requires, even if the individual acted under duress,

8

under threat of death, even if the individual did not

9

know that his conduct related to persecution, and even

10

But that

if the individual.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do we begin with the

12

assumption that this is a Chevron deference case?

13

think Aguirre, INS v. Aguirre, would tell us that it is.

14

It was a different statute.

15

assumption?

16

MR. PINCUS:

And I

Do we begin with that

Well, I think under Chevron

17

that, one, the first question is is there a gap to be

18

filled here?

19
20

The language -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, do I begin with

Chevron?

21

MR. PINCUS:

Well, yes.

We think Chevron

22

supplies the framework.

23

ambiguity.

24

principal submission is that there is no ambiguity here

25

and that there is therefore no occasion for deference.

The first question is, is there

We would -- we argue that here and our

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

If the Court were to disagree with that -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I take it your

3

position is that there's no ambiguity in the way the

4

term is used in the statute, as opposed to no ambiguity

5

in some abstract sense?

6

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, our submission,

7

Mr. Chief Justice, is that the phrase here, using the

8

principle that the Court applied in Watson and looking

9

at the phrase and looking at the picture that it brings

10

to mind, would never bring to mind the examples that I

11

cited as conduct that would be captured by this

12

provision.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Pincus, could I ask

14

about your description of the Government's position as

15

saying that it's purely objective and that there's no

16

mental factor whatever.

17

not only would not take into account coercion, the fact

18

that it was done under coercion, but also would not take

19

into account the fact that the individual even knew?

Is it clear that the Government

20

MR. PINCUS:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

There are cases -- that he was persecuting

somebody?
MR. PINCUS:

Yes, Your Honor, there are

24

cases, some of which that determination has been

25

reversed by a court of appeals.

But the BIA has taken

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the position that -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Has the Government taken

3

that position here in in this case?

4

MR. PINCUS:

The -- well, we pointed out

5

that that is the position that the BIA has taken and the

6

Government has not disavowed it.

7

whether they're -

8
9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So I don't know

I guess I should ask the

Government?
MR. PINCUS:

Yes, Your Honor.

But there

11

certainly have been a number of decisions along that

12

line, including one, for example, where an individual

13

was told, you know, "Stand here. "

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I could think that that's

15

wrong without thinking that you also have to take into

16

account whether there was coercion.

17

MR. PINCUS:

You could, Your Honor, although

18

the underlying -- the Government's underlying theory for

19

all three of its positions, both that coercion doesn't

20

matter, that knowledge doesn't matter, and that

21

subjective intent doesn't matter, is its view that these

22

words require only objective acts.

23

determined that the words require something more -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Once you've

it's very common in -- in criminal statutes to require

knowledge of the act.

3

he's not a criminal.

4

clear that the fact that the -- you killed somebody

5

because otherwise they'd break your arm would -- would

6

be a justification.

7

quite separable.

Indeed, if the person doesn't

Whereas, it is not automatically

Well, two responses, Your

Certainly in the criminal context, duress is a

10

well-recognized defense and this Court has said that in

11

Dixon and other cases.

12

the knowledge that we are talking about here that the

13

Government has disavowed is not knowledge that you

14

engaged in an act.

15

position that sleepwalking is -- can be a persecutive

16

act.

17

act is contributing to persecution -- you're kept in the

18

dark by the actual persecutors; they just ask you to do

19

something that in fact is contributing to persecution -

20

- they say that doesn't matter, and that it all rests on

21

what we think is their wrong-headed construction of the

22

statute.

But I just want to be clear that

They don't -- they don't take the

and that would be a pretty logical starting point, we

think.

16

the Court corrected the view that the statute doesn't -

17

that coercion is irrelevant, just to, within the limits

18

of Chevron, define what the coercion test is.

There is of course a

don't -- there are 500 men, women and children in a

shed; if you don't administer lethal gas to them, we are

22

going to administer 20 lashes, that would be sufficient

23

in your view?

24
25

MR. PINCUS:

Well, under some -- under some

conceptions of this defense, there is a balancing test
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

between the threat that is directed against the

2

individual and the threat -- and what the injury that he

3

is asked to carry out.

4

That could be part of the test.

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

helpful.

6

you strike it there?

7

Well, that's not very

How would the balancing be struck?

MR. PINCUS:

How would

Well, what the courts have said

8

in the criminal context is that there are three

9

criteria:

An immediate threat of death or serious

10

bodily injury; a well-grounded fear that it will be

11

carried out; and no reasonable opportunity to escape.

12

That's the general standard.

13

--

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So in the criminal context

So you wouldn't balance.

15

So, you know, gas these 20,000 people or we will kill

16

you?

17

MR. PINCUS:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

right, and that's okay?

20

MR. PINCUS:

It might be appropriate You gas the 20,000 people,

Well, some courts have said

21

that murder is a different kettle of fish and that there

22

is a question unanswered in the Federal system about

23

whether or not there is a direct defense for murder.

24

The States are divided.

25

yes, there should be.

The Model Penal Code has said
That is one of the issues that
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

would be open for the Attorney General to the extent he

2

wishes to exercise his discretion to decide.

3

What's clear, though, is, we think, the

4

rule -- the current construction of the statute is not

5

right.

6

developed in the criminal context that could be a very

7

logical starting point.

8
9

There is a body of law out there that is well

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why shouldn't the

starting point be what this Court decided in the

10

Fedorenko case?

11

close to the wording of that statute, much closer than

12

the UN covenant that you have referred to.

13

The wording of this provision is very

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, two responses

14

to that.

15

text was very context-specific and it shows that.

16

language that applied there specifically referred to the

17

enemy and specifically referred to persecution of

18

civilians, making it quite clear that that was a statute

19

that was targeted in the specific World War II context,

20

which was all that it applied to.

21

First of all, the language in Fedorenko, the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

It was also the distinction

22

about the use of the word "voluntary," in which the

23

operative language which barred those people didn't have

24

"voluntary" in it, and I forget what it was, the next

25

textual section it was there, so it was reason to infer
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that voluntary activity was not a criteria for the bar.

2

Isn't that right?

3

MR. PINCUS:

Exactly, Your Honor, and the

4

Court said the deliberate omission -- it specifically

5

looked at the fact that these sections were adopted at

6

the same time, followed on each other immediately, and

7

one had "voluntary," and then it said this was a

8

deliberate omission and we conclude that that deliberate

9

omission provides the basis for interpreting the

10
11

language JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you take the position

12

that the Government is wrong in saying that it's bound

13

by Fedorenko and that's the reason perhaps for us to

14

send it back?

15

MR. PINCUS:

Exactly, Your Honor.

I was

16

going to get to the second part of your Chevron question

17

and respond just that.

18

contrary to our submission, that the language here is

19

ambiguous and there's a gap to fill, our position is -

20

and we think it's quite well borne out by the decisions

21

-- that the BIA's decisions here rested on the mistaken

22

assumption that Fedorenko bound it in this case.

23
24
25

If the Court were to conclude,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And do we begin with the

decision in Rodriguez-Majano, the BIA decision MR. PINCUS:

Yes.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

MR. PINCUS:

Rodriguez-Majano was the first

one.

The issue was not even raised in that case.

9

In

"The service agreed at oral

So there really wasn't an issue

But all that's there is a sentence and a

10

decision just mistakenly believed Fedorenko controlled

11

the case.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, to give the devil his

13

due, it's not just the BIA that took that view, it's

14

every court of appeals that -- that has looked at this

15

provision has said that Fedorenko is a guide to what it

16

means, right?

17

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you are faulting the BIA

19

for -- you are saying it's beyond reasonable

20

interpretation for the BIA to adopt the -- the

21

resolution of the ambiguity, assuming there is an

22

ambiguity, which comports with every court of appeals to

23

address the matter has said?

24
25

MR. PINCUS:

I think there are -- there are

two different questions here, Justice Scalia.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

If the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

BIA purported to -- if the -- if the BIA said there is a

2

gap to fill here, we are going to exercise our expertise

3

and discretion and decide that, that would be one

4

situation.

5

believed erroneously that Fedorenko compelled the

6

result, that it thought this was a Chevron step one

7

case, and it was merely reciting what it believed to be

8

the rule and saying that Fedorenko controls.

9

think -

10
11

We think it's quite clear here that the BIA

JUSTICE SCALIA:
clear?

12

So we

Why do you think that's

What's -- what's the text you rely on?
MR. PINCUS:

The text that we are relying on

13

is -- is the actual decision, which just makes a flat

14

statement, again in dicta:

15

am reading from Rodriguez-Majano.

16
17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

Do I have it in front of

me?

18
19

"The participation or" -- I

MR. PINCUS:

You don't.

It's a decision of

the BIA.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, gee.

I mean, if this

21

is central to your case, don't you think I ought to have

22

the language in front of me somewhere?

23
24
25

MR. PINCUS:

Well, actually the language is

on page 27 of our yellow brief.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wonderful.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PINCUS:

At the very top of the page.

2

So all that there is there is a recitation of the rule

3

and a citation to Fedorenko.

4
5

And our submission is -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a "see" citation,

right?

6

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I mean, you know,

8

it's just not a flat citation which would say that

9

governs.

It means this is a relevant case that you

10

should look to.

11

You try to distinguish it, but it's certainly something

12

you should consider, no?

13
14

MR. PINCUS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's all you have to

say that they -- they based it on Fedorenko?

17
18

Well, Your Honor, it is

certainly -

15
16

And you don't deny that it's relevant.

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

Well, first of all, as I

say -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. PINCUS:

That's not very much.

-- the statement in this

21

decision is dicta.

Here I'm not sure whether they

22

consulted the Bluebook before they picked the "see"

23

cite, but -- but it -- it seems to me that -- that all

24

we have here is a legal rule and a legal rule that

25

generally has been perceived to be the rule that -- that
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was announced by Fedorenko, not tied in any way to the

2

different statutory language at issue in this case or

3

anything else.

4

Let me -- let me also turn to the second

5

decision that is relied on, which is the decision in

6

this case.

7

6a of the petition.

8

its prior decision in Matter of Fedorenko, it -- it

9

recites this rule.

10
11

And there -- and I am looking at -- at page
And the BIA says, citing to -- to

Now -

JUSTICE SCALIA:
isn't it?

12

MR. PINCUS:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. PINCUS:

15

It's a "see" cite again,

It's another "see" cite.
All right, that's good.

Which they indicate because

they are actually directly -- well, anyway.

16

The Matter of Fedorenko, that's a case -

17

and I apologize.

18

that relied on the DPA.

19

involved the Holtzman Amendment, again not the statute

20

at issue in this case, and therefore just sort of

21

reflexively taking a rule in a different case and

22

applying it to this very different statute without any

23

analysis.

24

BIA logic, but I think it is important.

25

In our brief we said that was the case
That's actually a case that

And not to get into too much of a train of

The second case cited here, Matter of
15

2

that Matter of Fedorenko relies on, again specifically

3

called out the language of Fedorenko and says, as in

4

Fedorenko -- and I am quoting from page 464 of that

5

decision -- as in Fedorenko, the plain language mandates

6

the result.

7

So here in -- in all of the BIA analysis,

8

there is no analysis in terms of exercising expertise

9

and discretion.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

that?

If -- if they say

Official - Subject to Final Review

that the plain language of the statute dictates a

2

particular result, I say -- I suspect that that's a

3

concession we are in Chevron step one, rather than two.

4

MR. PINCUS:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And

5

that's why in -- my response to Justice Kennedy's

6

question is that if the Court were to disagree with us

7

and conclude, contrary to our submission that the

8

language is ambiguous, then we don't have an exercise of

9

agency discretion under step one or step two, because

10

all the agency decisions rest on the belief that the

11

statutory language forecloses that -- the -- the.

12

Exercise of that discretion.

13

So in that event we submit the appropriate

14

result would be to remand the case, but -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Pincus, can you tell

16

me:

17

indeed, your client is -- is denied asylum because -

18

6

7

him, is that -- is that it?

MR. PINCUS:

he gets to stay here as long as sending him back would

10

not involve torture.

11

the protection that generally would be available in two

12

senses:

13

So the protection is narrower than

First of all, it only applies to torture.

16

protected -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, really?

18

MR. PINCUS: -- the CAT would not protect

19

you.

And CAT also does not protect you against

20

non-state actions.

21

where a lot of the bad things that happen in other

going to have to decide the degree of the threat that

10

the asylum claimant underwent and the consequences of

11

failing to comply with whatever he was directed to do.

12

And they are going to have to do that based solely on

13

the credibility determination made about an

14

uncorroborated witness who's typically testifying

15

through an interpreter and who has all of the mannerisms

and aspects of speech of someone who comes from an

entirely different culture.

that might be an easy question.

from a country where there is persecution, and they

could easily have been subjected to it, or they could

MR. PINCUS:

And -- and we also think it's

significant in this respect, that the Secretary of

10

Homeland Security has in connection with a different

11

disability, the material support disability, said that,

12

promulgated an exclusion for -- in some circumstances

13

for people who are coerced to provide material support.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I am quite curious why -- I

15

am curious, why did you answer Justice Alito's question

"yes"?

case, the Attorney General would still have tremendous

18

leeway in deciding where, when, under what

19

circumstances, the duress defense applied.

20

that so?

21
22

I -- I would have thought that if you win this

MR. PINCUS:

That's absolutely right,

Justice Breyer.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

do you not -- why was your answer yes?

25

Why isn't

MR. PINCUS:

If that's right, then why

My answer was in the absence of
21

action by the Attorney General.

2

absolutely right that the important thing to point out

3

here is, as with the standard itself, the Attorney

4

General could in the asylum context decide that in

5

certain kinds of situations that this coercion is not

relevant.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I think you are

Mr. Pincus, refresh my

8

recollection about something about the Fedorenko case,

9

which I should have reread, but I honestly didn't in

10

detail.

11

Justice Alito makes was really part of the background of

12

the case there was that nobody really believed his

testimony?

14

that he was telling the truth, but it was pretty clear

15

he was not.

purposes of decision, that this man is telling the

17

truth?

18

Am I not correct that the point that

It was assumed, for purposes of decision,

Whereas here everybody does assume, for

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, I think that's -- that's

19

correct, Justice Stevens.

And part of what was going on

20

there was the sheer -- two things:

21

administrative burden of millions of refugees and the

22

need to process them in some kind of expeditious

fashion; and the fact that it was known that there was

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. KATSAS

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

MR. KATSAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

In categorical terms, the Immigration and

8

Nationality Act provides that persons who assist or

9

otherwise participate in persecution may not obtain

10

certain immigration benefits.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where you stopped -

12

you stopped in the part that interests me, "participated

13

in persecution on account of race, religion, nationality

14

or membership in a particular group.

15

are forced to engage in persecution, it's not because of

16

the victim's race or religion; it's because someone's

17

got a gun at their head.

18

When these people

So, you ask them, "Well, why did you do

19

that?

20

will say:

21

not going to say, I -- you know, because I was biased

22

against his race or religion.

23

Why did you, you know, whip that person?
Because they were going to kill me.

MR. KATSAS:

They
They are

No, but the -- the "on account

24

of" phrase, Mr. Chief Justice, modifies the

25

"persecution."

The persecution in this case was
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

directed -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how do you

3

know that?

4

"incited," "participated in"?

5

Did they participate in the persecution on account of

6

race; or did they participate, again, in the persecution

7

on account of what the -- what the force exerted against

8

them was?

9

Why can't it just as easily modify

MR. KATSAS:

You have persecution.

I think grammatically, the

10

immediately preceding noun is "persecution."

11

account of" phrase modified -- modified the assistance,

12

Mr. Chief Justice, it seems to me that would prove far

13

too much, in that a prison guard who served voluntarily,

14

voluntarily in order to get a paycheck, wouldn't be

15

within the bar because he would -- he wouldn't be

16

assisting on account of -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If the "on

Well, that just

18

bring you back to what "assistance" means.

19

normal statutory canon, you have got "ordered,"

20

"incited," "assisted."

21

MR. KATSAS:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you -

Right.
"Assistance" can be

23

read in the same sense as ordered or incited with terms

24

of an active -- I don't know what it is -

25

predisposition or desire.

Or it can be read in the
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

manner you suggested, somebody who's just doing it

2

for -- for the paycheck.

3
4

So, if we read it in eiusdem generis terms,
then I think your response falls short.

5

MR. KATSAS:

I don't -- I don't think so,

6

Mr. Chief Justice, in that the question here -- the

7

question here is the availability of a duress defense.

8

One can -- one can order persecution under duress just

9

as one could assist in persecution under duress.

10

Imagine, for instance, the camp commandant

11

at Treblinka ordering the slaughter of thousands of

12

innocent people.

13

under duress because if I don't, if I don't order

14

persecution, someone up my chain of command will kill

15

me, which is precisely what's wrong with Petitioner's

16

theory here, its -- its unbounded nature.

17

He could say:

Well, I'm doing that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that

18

argument is at one extreme, where if this does apply as

19

the way Petitioner suggests we assume the Attorney

20

General can exercise his discretion and not afford

21

relief.

22

the horrific examples that Mr. Pincus suggested; and in

23

those circumstances the Attorney General could exercise

24

his discretion to afford relief.

25

But on the other hand, it could go to some of

MR. KATSAS:

The Attorney General does not
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have discretion with respect to withholding.

2

remember, the persecutor bar in the asylum statute is

3

identical to the persecutor bar in the withholding

4

statute.

5

And

But in any event, this Court said in cases

6

like Phinpathya the fact that the text goes to an

7

eligibility requirement is not a ground for the Court

8

reading in limitations that aren't there on the theory

9

that the Attorney General can address something case by

10

case.

That's because immigration is subject to the

11

plenary control of Congress, and when Congress writes a

12

rule and this Court converts it into a standard, it's

13

shifting control over the immigration laws from Congress

14

to the Executive and ultimately to the courts.

15

It seems to us that reasoning governs here.

16

With respect to your question about hard hypotheticals,

17

I don't dispute that there are hard, sympathetic -

18

sympathetic persecutors on Mr. Pincus' side of the case,

19

but keep in mind what is at stake here.

20

Persecution is not typically a grassroots

21

phenomenon.

It's a -- it's a phenomenon typically

22

ordered by governments or rebel groups aspiring to be

23

governments.

24

coercion.

25

prison guard in this case who held a gun to keep people

It's typically carried out through

So if Petitioners are correct, not only the

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

out in the sun until they died, not only would he have a

2

colorable defense, but so too would every single guard

3

at Treblinka.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so too would, I

5

gather, the person who is threatened with harm if he

6

doesn't build the prison walls, right?

7

are going to be used to persecute people and hold them

8

in.

9

interpretations they go either way.

I mean, if -- you know, if you push the extreme

10

MR. KATSAS:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

He knows they

But the point Does he -- does he

persecute people on account of race?

13

MR. KATSAS:

Well -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We have a prison

15

here; we are going to hold members of a particular

16

racial group here, and we are going to force you to

17

build the walls.

18

MR. KATSAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, you are

19

absolutely correct that there will, of course, be hard

20

cases about how broadly to draw the circle.

21

Fedorenko, this Court instructed that the way to deal

22

with that problem is not by reading in a -- a

23

voluntariness exception into a statute that simply

24

doesn't contain it, but rather by -

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in

Well, but your position is

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that it is unbounded.

2

statute requiring specific intent, scienter, concepts of

3

personal responsibility, we don't say this is unbounded.

4
5

MR. KATSAS:

If the legislature passes a

Of course, Justice Kennedy,

Congress could pass a statute with whatever -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm saying in the general

7

criminal law.

We don't say, oh, this is unbounded.

8

This is what courts are for.

9

is for, is to establish and define what duress means,

This is what adjudication

10

what scienter means, what degree of intent is culpable,

11

what isn't.

12

It's not unbounded.
MR. KATSAS:

That's true in the context of

13

criminal law.

14

Justice Kennedy.

15

passes criminal statutes legislates against a background

16

of hundreds of years of common law precedent in the

17

criminal area; and this Court has said presumptively

18

Congress legislates against that common law background,

19

and that is the theory for on some occasions reading

20

mens rea requirements and common law defenses like

21

duress into criminal statutes.

22

But think about why it's true,
It's true because Congress when it

Why not any statute?

I'm

24

25

back into the history of the human race -

It's thousands of years.

31
Alderson Reporting Company

You could go

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KATSAS:

Exactly.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and you will discover,

3

of course, that your word "involuntary" is never

4

something where the action is involuntary that we praise

5

or blame people.

6

or blame people must be a voluntary action.

7

example is:

8

saying that if this person's arm was blown by the wind,

9

that this statute prevents him having asylum in the

Rather, every action where we praise

"The wind blew my arm."

The classic

Now, you are

11

could one assume that involuntary actions are covered by

12

this statute -- are not covered?

13

MR. KATSAS:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. KATSAS:

How

Justice Breyer, the case Are covered.

Two points.

With respect -

16

with respect to involuntary actions, this case -- this

17

case doesn't present that question.

18
19

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. KATSAS:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.
And are you going to have

intentional actions?

23

MR. KATSAS:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Then once you

say that, then let's talk about intentional actions.

20

22

All right.

Yes.
Because praise or blame

typically involves a voluntary action, an intentional
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

action, and an action where there is a degree of

2

freedom, which is to say that the choice is not too

3

skewed.

4

reading into statutes that say nothing of the word

5

"intentional," and by the use of the duress defense.

And we see that in the criminal law by a

6

Now what reason do we have for thinking that

7

Congress didn't mean these words here in exactly that

8

way, which traces back at least to Aristotle?

9

MR. KATSAS:

Because the thousand-year

10

tradition that you correctly identify is a criminal law

11

tradition.

12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:
say criminal law.

14

Oh, but Aristotle doesn't

He says praise or blame.

MR. KATSAS:

Justice Breyer, this is a

15

statute -- this is a statute that allocates immigration

16

benefits.

17

There is no background in common law -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Immigration law is a creature of statute.

That's absolutely right.

19

But do you think Congress intended that this absolute

20

bar should apply where the person is in no sense

21

blameworthy?

22

MR. KATSAS:

The question -- with respect to

23

intentional conduct, the conduct at issue here,

24

Justice Breyer, is knowing and intentional.

25

no question about 33
Alderson Reporting Company

So there is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, the reasoning here, Mr.

2

Katsas, it seems to me implicates exactly what

3

Justice Breyer brings up.

4

-- on the extent of the reliance by the BIA for its

5

general policy on Fedorenko, and what the does a see

6

cite mean and so on.

7

going to page 6a or 7a from which Mr. Pincus was -- was

8

earlier quoting, if you look on page 7a, the reason that

9

Fedorenko is thought to be appropriate here is, he -

We had a colloquy earlier on

But in -- in this particular case,

10

that is to say, the Petitioner here -- has not

11

demonstrated his conduct is distinguishable from that of

12

the alien in that case.

13

that case was identified as relevant by the

14

voluntary/involuntary distinction.

15

because of the text of the statute, voluntary was used

16

in one place; it wasn't used in the place where the bar

17

was set up.

18

The conduct of the alien in

It was so identified

So that it seems to me that by the express

19

reasoning in this case, this case is governed by a rule

20

that in effect says the distinction between voluntary

21

and involuntary action is not a relevant distinction.

22

So I don't thin k you can get by in this

23

case without confronting just what Justice Breyer says.

24

And I don't see how you can answer his point in this

25

case without admitting that Fedorenko in fact was -- was
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

improvidently relied upon, because it's not good

2

authority here.

3

MR. KATSAS:

I -- I don't know why it -

4

with respect to the BIA's reasoning, this decision is a

5

straightforward application of 20 years of BIA precedent

6

concluding -- consistent with Fedorenko that

7

voluntariness is not relevant matter.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

consistency with Fedorenko.

This is not really
This -- in this case the

10

BIA is saying that he cannot say that his conduct in

11

effect is different from the conduct in Fedorenko.

12

what was relevant about the Fedorenko conduct was it did

13

not have to be voluntary conduct.

14

And

So it is bringing -- it seems to me, the

15

reasoning in this case is relying upon a rule that says

16

that the voluntary/involuntary distinction is not

17

significant.

18

MR. KATSAS:

Right.

That was the

19

construction -- with the construction -

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21

Which answers

Justice Breyer's question.

22

MR. KATSAS:

But the -- I may be missing

23

some of the subtlety of your point.

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

(Laughter.)

But let me try -

I doubt it, but go ahead.

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KATSAS:

Let me try it this way.

The -

2

the statutory formulation that we are discussing is the

3

concept of assistance in persecution.

4

context of the displaced person's act construes that

5

provision to make involuntariness irrelevant as a matter

6

of law.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

MR. KATSAS:

9

Fedorenko in the

Right.

Many courts of appeals and the

BIA repeatedly over the last 20 years have held that the

10

reasoning that Fedorenko governs not only the displaced

11

person's act, where it is of course directly

12

controlling, but subsequent statutes, of which there are

13

no fewer than seven, using essentially the identical

14

formulation of assistance in persecution:

15

carries forward that formulation in a canonical way

16

statute after statute.

17

Congress

If you look to legislative history, you will

18

see that Congress repeatedly expresses an affirmative

19

intent that all of these persecutor bar provisions be

20

construed in pari materia and against that backdrop we

21

have administrative precedent.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But one thing that Congress

23

has not done and it didn't do it in this Act, is to make

24

the express voluntary/involuntary distinction textually

25

that the DPA made in Fedorenko.

And it seems to me that

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the reasoning set out in this case says this is exactly

2

textual treatment that you had in -- in the DPA statute

MR. KATSAS:

You -- well, you have the same

"voluntary," whereas the bar does not use the word

MR. KATSAS:

Throughout the

And they -

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Can you give me a couple of

3

examples of the voluntariness that creates in effect the

4

same distinction here as under the DPA?

5

MR. KATSAS:

Sure.

Let me give you one:

6

The asylum -- the asylum statute -- the substantive

7

asylum statute itself in 8 U.S.C. 1158 provides -

8
9
10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Was that passed as part of

the same legislation that created the bar section we are
dealing with?

11

MR. KATSAS:

Yes and no.

Let me explain.

12

Section 1158, the substantive asylum law, did not have a

13

persecutor bar as originally enacted by the Refugee Act

14

of 1980.

15

statute was added in 1996 by the IIRIRA statute, which

16

in the same statute, in the same section, has a

17

provision that asylum can be terminated if the alien

18

voluntarily decides to return to his home.

19
20
21

The persecutor bar in the substantive asylum

So you have a contrast in the same section
of the same statute.

Conduct-based -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it's -- I don't want to

22

split hairs here, but I mean the voluntary return

23

behavior is a behavior of the alien in this country with

24

respect to, in effect, an election under existing

25

federal law; whereas, the voluntary/involuntary
38

1

distinction in the DPA was a distinction that referred

2

to the alien's conduct overseas at the relevant time.

3

MR. KATSAS:

That's a fair point,

4

Justice Souter, but to the extent part of the reasoning

5

in Fedorenko rests on the -- and the inference from the

6

contrast, those same contrasts are present here where -

And your position is that it has narrowed that class,

better to have a provision that simply excludes those

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Well, speaking of -

to get back to the language, what's wrong with saying,
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you have a clause that says "otherwise participated,"

2

right?

3

MR. KATSAS:

Right.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that must mean, I

5

gather, or could mean that "assisted" does not have as

6

broad a meeting as you suggest, because otherwise the

7

"otherwise participated" language would be unnecessary

8

and redundant.

9

MR. KATSAS:

I don't think so,

10

Mr. Chief Justice, because the statutory sequence is the

11

word "assist" goes all the way back to the Displaced

12

Persons Act in the 1977 -- when Congress changes

13

"assist" to "assists or otherwise participates in" -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. KATSAS:

16
17

Right.

-- the only consequence of

that, if any, could be a broadening, not a narrowing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm not sure

18

that's right, because if "otherwise participated" covers

19

-- "assisted" does not include "otherwise participated,"

20

and I understood your broad reading of "assisted" to

21

cover the prison walls, and if it does, then I would say

22

"assisted" needs to be interpreted with "ordered" and

23

"incited," and if it is, then "otherwise participated"

24

should be interpreted along the same lines.

25

MR. KATSAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, the word
41

Alderson Reporting Company

"assist" was construed in Fedorenko not to -- not to

2

contain an implicit voluntariness exception.

adds to that the word "participate," which this Court in

MR. KATSAS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's very helpful.

But You -- can I get from you

8

an answer to the question that I put to Mr. Pincus?

9

you -- does the Government deny even the necessity of

knowledge that what you are doing is assisting in the

persecution of somebody?

12

that you are assisting in the persecution?

13

MR. KATSAS:

Do

You don't even have to know

In this case, Justice Scalia,

14

our position is that knowledge is a sufficient mens rea

15

and is clearly satisfied here where Petitioner, by his

What is your answer to the

question?

MR. KATSAS:

We have taken the position,

required.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. KATSAS:

It's been rejected by a few

I mean,

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- because that's -

because we've seen the need for specificity.

17

question, I think, Justice Stevens had, and certainly I

18

have, is why do you read some aspects of what it takes

19

to hold a person responsible into the statute, but you

20

don't read other aspects of what it takes to hold a

21

person responsible morally into the statute?

22

MR. KATSAS:

But the

We don't read -- our position

23

is it's not fair to -- it's not fair to incorporate the

24

full common law background criminal concepts, including

25

that of duress.

The question by Justice Breyer whether
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

assistance in persecution contains an implicit duress

2

limitation seems to me very different from the question

3

whether it contains an implied knowledge limitation.

4

And the latter question is not present here with respect

5

to a prison guard who, by his own admission, knew

6

exactly what was going on and deliberately implemented

7

torture by keeping people in the sun, exposed in the sun

8

to the point of death.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your concession -

10

statement earlier on, that there are going to be

11

situations for judicial line-drawing -

12

MR. KATSAS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it suggests to

14

me that BIA's discretion isn't applicable here under

15

Chevron step two.

16

is not a situation where the statute never applies.

17

Because what you are saying is this

In a situation where you can logically

a but-for logical intention between the action and

3

MR. KATSAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, they

4

certainly get discretion in conducting the analysis of

5

what constitutes assistance.

6

that -- that inquiry is independent of any question of

7

duress on -- it said that the inquiry should happen

19

the woman who cuts the hair does participate in the

persecution if there is a guideline that says look, we

are not going to execute anybody unless -- before their

hair is cut, right?

23
24
25

MR. KATSAS:

I would not say that.

I think

You would view that

as a case that's not covered by the statute, even if the

her job?

4

I think Fedorenko -- Fedorenko

says that the -- the level and degree and character of

constitute assistance.

At the other continuum of

Fedorenko, the guard served under duress.

found that if Fedorenko did not serve at the prison

guard -- at the prison camp, he would have been

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is that an apt analogy?

3

If we looked at all the duress cases that have been

decided since the beginning, are we going to find cases

5

where someone said -- someone claims that I was told I

6

had to kill 25 people, 100 people; I had to put people

7

out in the sun until they died, because if I didn't do

8

that, I was going to be shot?

9

Aren't the situations entirely different?

10

MR. PINCUS:

I think you are combining two

11

questions, Your Honor.

One -- one is should this

12

language be interpreted to have a coercive -- to require

13

uncoerced conduct in order to label someone a

14

persecutor.

15

that question, because the underlying treaty that was

16

implemented specifically referred to crimes, and crimes

17

generally have that -- that -- crimes don't -- a

18

criminal liability doesn't apply to someone who acts if

19

they are coerced.
