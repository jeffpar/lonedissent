ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE

Solicitor General Garre.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL GARRE:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case involves a challenge to the

13

efforts of the Federal Communications Commission to

14

carry out its statutory mandate under 18 U.S.C. 1464,

15

and more even-handedly address indecent material that is

16

broadcast directly into the home during the time of day

17

when children are likely to be in the viewing audience.

18

After reconsidering its policy in this area,

19

the Commission determined that an enforcement action may

20

be appropriate in the case of indecent language that is

21

isolated as well as repeated.

22

provided a reasoned explanation for that change in

23

course, the court of appeals erred in invalidating its

24

action under the Administrative Procedures Act.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because the Commission

Did it -- did it reconsider
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

its policy?

2

gathered that it had, but its second order said

3

basically, we've never had a policy that single use of

4

these expletives is okay.

5

changing their policy or not?

6

In the first order, I would -- I would have

GENERAL GARRE:

Which is it?

Are they

They did change the policy,

7

Justice Scalia, and the Commission directly acknowledged

8

that in paragraph 12 of the Golden Globe Awards order,

9

which is not reprinted in the petition appendix.

In

10

that paragraph, the Commission said, "We now depart from

11

cases holding that isolated or fleeting use of the

12

F-Word was not indecent."

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The latest order, the one

14

that's up here, says that all of the statements to that

15

effect in the past were simply staff statements and that

16

the Commission had never held to that effect before.

17

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, the court of appeals

18

recognized, and we think correctly so, that the

19

Commission did change its position on that.

20

Commission had never brought an enforcement action

21

against a broadcaster for the isolated use of an

22

expletive, and the Commission made clear in the orders

23

it issued in this case, beginning with the Golden Globe

24

Awards order and the particular omnibus and remand

25

orders before this Court, that it was taking a change in
4
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

regulatory course in determining that it was appropriate

2

to bring an enforcement action where there was an

3

isolated incident of an expletive if the context

4

suggested that it would be indecent in that situation.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, is the agency's

6

position that its policy has changed or that it has not

7

changed?

8
9

GENERAL GARRE:

That it has changed,

Justice Kennedy, and the court of appeals recognized

10

that at pages 20a to 21a of the decision.

11

this Court has recognized -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And we think

Well, the court

13

recognized, but it seems to me the FCC -- and this is

14

what Justice Scalia's questions go in part to -- in the

15

remand order at first it said its policy hadn't changed.

16

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, I think there were

17

some statements, we would acknowledge that, in different

18

places.

19

grappled with this, paragraph -- paragraph 12 of the

20

Golden Globe Awards order, it specifically disavowed its

21

prior decisions in which it had said that isolated

22

expletives would not warrant an enforcement action under

23

1464, and it specifically said, "we are departing from

24

our policy."

25

But if you go to the heart of where the FCC

We -- after all, it didn't impose -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I think it rewrote that
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in its last order, and I think it even explained away

2

the Golden Globe statement by saying it was not as

3

categorical as it might appear.

4

GENERAL GARRE:

I think if you look at maybe

5

pages 82 to 83 of the petition appendix here, where we

6

discuss that as well, I think it made clear with respect

7

to the indecency finding involving the 2003 Billboard

8

Music Awards and the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, that

9

in applying its contextual analysis in the past it

10

focused on whether or not expletives were repeated or

11

dwelled upon.

12

that it was not going to be guided exclusively by that

13

consideration and that it was going to take into account

14

all contextual factors, including the explicit and

15

graphic nature of the language used.

16

In this case, the Commission determined

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you think, in

17

terms of our legal review, it makes a difference whether

18

it's a change or whether it's a continuation of a prior

19

policy?

20

GENERAL GARRE:

Certainly, I would be

21

defending it if the Court thought that it wasn't a

22

change, and it would have been inappropriate for the

23

Second Circuit to invalidate that as arbitrary and

24

capricious.

25

language that the Commission used indicated that it was

We have -- we think it was a change.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

departing from its prior understanding, and we are here

2

defending -- either way, we are here defending -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess my question

4

is, do you think a different legal standard applies when

5

an agency changes a prior position as opposed to

6

articulating its position for the first time?

7

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, this Court has said

8

that it's desirable for agencies to reconsider and to

9

change its policy from time to time, but when -

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wasn't the Commission -

11

the Commission asked the Second Circuit, said:

12

changed our policy; we want you to remand the case to

13

the Commission so the Commission can explain what its

14

new policy.

15

arose?

16

Commission said it wanted to have an opportunity to

17

explain its position more fully?

18
19
20

We've

I mean, isn't that how this whole thing

The case was in the Second Circuit and the

GENERAL GARRE:

It is, and it did in the

remand order reprinted in the petition appendix.
Mr. Chief Justice, I think either way the

21

ultimate standard is arbitrary and capriciousness.

22

the Respondents have focused on whether or not we have

23

complied with the criteria that the Court has looked to

24

in determining whether or not a change in agency

25

position is arbitrary and capricious.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Now,

And we think that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there are three factors here that must lead to the

2

conclusion that it was not arbitrary and capricious.

3

One, we think that the Commission did

4

directly acknowledge its change in position.

5

Commission provided a concrete explanation for that

6

change.

7

plausible and consistent with the Commission's statutory

8

mandate.

9

agency position where those three factors have been

10

Two, the

And, three, that explanation is at a minimum

This Court has never invalidated a change in

present.

11

And if you look at the three principal

12

justifications that the agency used in explaining its

13

change in position, I think it's absolutely clear that

14

this was at a minimum a rational policy choice that the

15

agency was committed -- was permitted to take under the

16

Administrative Procedures Act.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One of the problems is

18

that, seeing it in operation, there seems to be no rhyme

19

or reason for some of the decisions that the Commission

20

has made.

21

filled with expletives, and yet the film about jazz

22

history, the words were considered a violation of the

23

Commission's policies.

24

little rhyme or reason to when the Commission says that

25

one of these words is okay and when it says it isn't.

I mean, the "Saving Private Ryan" case was

So that there seems to be very

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, we do think, of

2

course, that there is rhyme or reason to its

3

determination.

4

vagueness type of arguments that the Respondents are

5

making similar to your question could be made equally

6

with respect to the Commission's policy with respect to

7

repeated utterances as well as isolated utterances.

8
9

First, let me say that much of the

If you take the "Saving Private Ryan" and
the blues documentary example, those were repeated

10

utterances cases.

11

the Commission's change in policy to go from repeated

12

utterances to consider enforcement actions in the case

13

of isolated expletives where they met its contextual

14

analysis and where it was explicit, graphic, shocking or

15

pandering in the context.

16

We are here because they challenged

Now, I think certainly there are going to be

17

situations and this Court has indicated that the

18

vagueness inquiry doesn't turn about coming up with

19

hypotheticals at -- at the outer margins of the

20

standard.

21

I think in the Pacifica case our reading of

22

the Court's decision is similar to the D.C.

23

reading of that decision in the Action for Children's

24

Television case, that implicit in the Court's decision

25

in Pacifica was that it rejected a vagueness challenge
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Circuit's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the Commission's definition of "indecency," which is

2

the same definition that the Commission is applying

3

today.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose the most

5

difficult case for you is the "Early News" case where

6

you have just a fleeting expletive, unlike "Saving

7

Private Ryan" and the others.

8

distinguish the "Early News" case from the ones before

9

us?

10

GENERAL GARRE:

I mean, how do you

The Commission has

11

determined that news programming would be treated

12

differently, with greater restraint, because of the

13

different values present in that situation.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the same -- if

15

you had a news report about Nicole Richey and the Cher

16

exhibits, they -- they could use the actual language,

17

even though they can't during the -- the awards shows?

18

GENERAL GARRE:

Yes.

And, similarly, if

19

there were a news report about the argument today in

20

this Court and there were reports about the actual

21

language used, that's right.

22

exercised restraint in that area, recognizing that there

23

are different values at stake than in the -- in the

24

utterance of indecent language during a prime-time

25

broadcast where are a substantial number of children in

For the broadcast in this case, up to 24 to

3

28 percent of the viewing audience comprised children

4

under the age of 18.

5

gratuitous in the context it was used.

6

Richey example in 2003, there was an element of

7

pandering as part of the dialogue consisted of Paris

8

Hilton saying, "Watch your language," before Nicole

9

Richey launched into dropping the S-Word and the F-Word

This language was concededly
In the Nicole

10

in -- in a context that was, the FCC reasonably

11

determined, was shocking and gratuitous and explicit and

12

graphic; and, therefore, in the context in which it was

13

presented, indecent under the agency's longstanding

14

definition of "indecency."

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are there only those two

16

words in the FCC's new policy or are there other words

17

on the list?

18

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, certainly, the FCC's

19

action in this case focuses on the use of the F-Word and

20

the S-Word, and I think everyone acknowledges that a

21

word like the F-Word is one of the most graphic,

22

explicit, and vulgar words in the English language for

23

sexual activity.

24

concede that it was -- its use was gratuitous and

25

inappropriate here.

And I think even the networks here

And that would control 11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Isn't it true that -

2

isn't it true that that is a word that often is used

3

with -- with no reference whatsoever to the -- the

4

sexual connotation?

5

GENERAL GARRE:

It can be -- it certainly

6

can be used in a non-literal way.

7

metaphorical way, as Cher used it here, to say "F them"

8

to her critics.

9

distinction is not unique to the isolated expletives

10

It can be used in a

But the -- the non-literal/literal

versus the repeated effort -- expletives.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You think it's equally -

12

it's equally subject to being treated as indecent within

13

the meaning of the statute regardless of which meaning

14

was actually apparent to everybody who listened to it?

15

GENERAL GARRE:

I wouldn't say equally,

16

Justice Stevens, but what we would say is that it can

17

qualify as indecent under the -- under the Commission's

18

definition, because even the non-literal use of a word

19

like the F-Word, because of the core meaning of that

20

word as one of the most vulgar, graphic, and explicit

21

words for sexual activity in the English language, it

22

inevitably conjures up a core sexual image.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which is, indeed, why it's

used.
GENERAL GARRE:

Which is, indeed, why it's
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

used as an intensifier or as an insult, and it's why the

2

networks themselves -- and this is reprinted, I believe,

3

at 86 of the petition appendix -- have a 24-hour rule

4

that the F-Word generally should not be use on TV.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that is an

6

entirely voluntary -- I mean, the Commission would have

7

no objection if the F-Word were used on a regular basis

8

after 10:00 o'clock?

9

GENERAL GARRE:

Outside of the safe harbor

10

under this Court's decision, the -- the Commission

11

recognizes that networks can use indecent language.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Although they don't, I

gather.
GENERAL GARRE:

Although they don't.

Their

policies are not to use indecent language.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because they find it

offensive, I gather.
GENERAL GARRE:

Because I think they

recognize that it contravenes community standards for

20

appropriateness in the broadcast medium, and that -

those policies are reprinted at pages 86a to 88a of -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How are the contemporary

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, first of all, the

This is set out a little bit at page
Second of all,

And, third of all, the -- the Commission

10

citizens to determine what is consistent with community

11

standards.

12

And certainly the CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I suppose the

13

broadcasters' own voluntary determination not to use

14

that -- that language 24 hours is a reflection of what

15

they think about community standards.

16

GENERAL GARRE:

Absolutely.

I think it is

17

an irrefutable reflection of what they think the

18

appropriate community standards are.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you talking about

20

community standards for broadcasting?

21

GENERAL GARRE:

Community standards for

22

broadcasting, that's right.

And, in that respect, this

23

case is much different than the Reno case, for example,

24

where one of the criticisms this Court had was

25

uncertainty about what community standards would apply.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Another difference is -- is that here you

2

have the Commission, an expert agency, making these

3

determining -- making these determinations, drawing in

4

part on the policies and practices of the regulated

5

industry itself; for example, the self-imposed rule not

6

to use the F-Word at particular times of day.

7

And, of course, you have the fact that

8

broadcast television has always been subject to a lesser

9

standard of First Amendment scrutiny.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now -

Still, I gather

11

that's at issue with the constitutional questions.

Does

12

that still have the same force today when the broadcast

13

medium is only one of several that are -- that are

14

available?

15

Commission might not be accomplishing terribly much if

16

it regulates a particular medium when all sorts of other

17

media, media, are available that don't have the

18

Commission's oversight.

In other words, it seems to me that the

19

GENERAL GARRE:

20

it is reflected in the Court's cases.

me explain why.

22

think that this Court does not need to, and should not,

6

Can I -- can I ask?

You

Are you finished?

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, if -- if I can answer

7

the question as to the force of the Court's precedents,

8

this Court has repeatedly affirmed in cases like Sable,

9

in cases like Reno, in cases like Turner and Denver

10

Area, that broadcasting is subject to a different and

11

lesser First Amendment standard.

12

The Commission in this case looked to the

13

considerations that underlie that jurisprudential

14

doctrine and concluded that they were still apposite,

15

and that is at pages 108 to 110 of the petition

16

appendix.

17

Most Americans still get their information

18

and entertainment from broadcast TV.

19

broadcast TV is extremely accessible to children because

20

all they have to do is turn it on, and then they have

21

network shows that they can have access to.

22

broadcast television is still broadcast in a way that

23

invades the home, the place -- the one place where

24

people typically don't expect to have uninvited,

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but wasn't the

2

rationale for the lesser standard largely the scarcity

of the frequencies?

4

GENERAL GARRE:

I think that was the

5

rationale in Red -- Red Lion.

6

didn't rely on that rationale.

decision, Justice Stevens -- and I understand that you

wrote the plurality decision there.

12

decision, the Court did not rest so much on the scarcity

13

rationale, but, yet, on the unique pervasiveness of

14

broadcasting, the unique accessibility to children, and

the fact that broadcasting invades the home in a way

16

that other technologies do not.

20

the Turner case this Court said at page 190 that

broadcast medium is still the principal source of

22

information in entertainment in affirming the lesser

23

standard that this Court applies.

24

We actually think that the fact that there

25

are now additional mediums like the internet and cable
17
Alderson Reporting Company

TV, if anything, underscores the appropriateness of a

2

lower First Amendment standard or safety zone for

broadcast TV, because Americans who want to get indecent

programming can go to cable TV, they can go to the

5

Internet.

6

But broadcast TV is, as Congress designed

7

that to be, the one place where Americans can turn on

3

If you had a different context, say a

4

sporting event where there is an isolated expletive as

5

part of a post-game news interview, the Commission as it

would under its context-based approach, would look to

all the contextual factors and determine whether or not

it was indecent in that situation.

I mean, I think the whole thing was set up to be

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

GENERAL GARRE:

It was a setup.
-- to invite this kind of

6

abuse, which is one of the contextual factors that the

7

Commission looked at, along with the extremely shocking

8

and graphic nature of using this language at 9:00 p.m.

9

on an eastern night.

10
11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you didn't fine them,

anyway, did you?
GENERAL GARRE:

We did not fine them because

13

we exercised restraint in making -- in attempting to

14

make clear that the FCC going forward was going to

15

consider isolated -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because you had gone from

17

Pacifica until 2004 with a different policy, where this

18

kind of thing would have been okay?

19

GENERAL GARRE:

We had gone from Pacifica

20

until 1987, approximately, in the Action for Children's

21

Television case, where the Commission determined that

22

that approach limited only to the seven dirty words in

23

Pacifica was unduly narrow and inconsistent with its

24

enforcement responsibilities.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Remind me about that,

23
Alderson Reporting Company

1

because there was -- the statement that the networks

2

don't do this at all at the time of Action for

3

Children's Television, the fight was, was it going to be

4

from midnight 'til whatever it was.

5

more hours for adult viewing.

6

that the Commission gave them were hours when most

7

everybody is asleep.

8
9

GENERAL GARRE:

The networks wanted

They said the only hours

But I don't -- my

understanding was that was not pertaining to use of the

10

F-Word.

11

petition appendix, and described there.

12

Circuit found with respect to that change in position

13

that the Commission had supplied an adequate explanation

14

under the APA simply by saying that its prior practice,

15

enforcement practice, was unduly narrow and not

16

consistent with its enforcement responsibility.

17

The networks' policies are at 86 to 88a, the
The D.C.

We think that the even more detailed

18

explanation here clearly satisfies the APA standard that

19

applied to the Commission's change in position.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Maybe I shouldn't ask

21

this, but is there ever appropriate for the Commission

22

to take into consideration at all the question whether

23

the particular remark was really hilarious, very, very

24

funny?

25

Some of these things (Laughter.)

JUSTICE STEVENS:

laugh at.

3

you think?

4

-- you can't help but

GENERAL GARRE:

Yes, insofar as the

5

Commission takes into account whether it's shocking,

6

titillating, pandering -

7
8
9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, it's funny.

I mean,

bawdy jokes are okay if they are really good.
(Laughter.)
GENERAL GARRE:

Well, my point is that we

11

will take it into account, but I think you can recognize

12

the potentially greater harmful impact on children where

13

you have celebrities using particularly graphic, vulgar,

14

explicit, indecent language as part of the comedic

15

routine during a show that children are comprising a

16

substantial part of the viewing audience.

17

And that is one of the factors that is

18

appropriate under this Court's decision in Pacifica and

19

the Commission's policy to take into account the time of

20

day and the viewing audience.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could you review me to one

22

thing in the record if it's there, or just tell me.

23

did find an explanation for the agency deciding that

24

"fleeting" is not going to be an automatic exemption.

25

They've talked about that.
25
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

What I didn't find is an explanation for a

2

second thing, which had to do with their first prong of

3

their former test, and that was the distinction that

4

used to be made between using these words as swear words

5

and using them as descriptive words.

6

showed up in their former policy because they said if

7

they were used as a swear word we are not going to go

8

after them, at least not immediately.

9

with prong 1, not prong 2.

10

GENERAL GARRE:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

why they made that change?

13

GENERAL GARRE:

14

Now that, I think,

So that had to do

Right.
So is there an explanation

Well, prong 1 hasn't

changed, Justice Breyer, since the time -

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

GENERAL GARRE:

It hasn't?
-- of Pacifica.

It has not.

17

It's the same explanation, whether descriptions or

18

depictions of sexual or excretorial organs or

19

activities, the same definition before the Court in

20

Pacifica.

21

And as the Pacifica monologue makes clear,

22

there were many both literal and non-literal uses of the

23

F-Word and S-Word and other words in that monologue.

24

So, I think the Commission's position is this kind of

25

language has always been indecent, which is -- what has
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

changed is it's now going to consider enforcement action

2

when is it's used in an isolated basis on a context

3

based approach.

4

If I can reserve -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I just ask one

6

question?

It's about the bottom line of your brief.

7

This whole argument has an air of really futility,

8

because the Second Circuit more than tipped its hand

9

when it said:

And even as they gave a reasoned

10

explanation, we have grave doubts whether this would be

11

constitutional.

12

You suggested in your brief a remand for

13

briefing and a hearing in the Second Circuit on the

14

constitutional issue.

15

say, well, really, this issue that's before us now is

16

ignoring the big elephant in the rule, room; we have to

17

get to that anyway?

18

So, is there a way that we can

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, that approach would be

19

consistent with this Court not deciding issues that

20

haven't been decided below and the general practice of

21

constitutional avoidance.

22

three different places in its decision, on page 2a and

23

page 35a, and at the end of its decision, made clear

24

that it was not deciding the constitutional issues.

25

Judge Laval who dissented didn't say anything about the

Now, the Second Circuit at

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

constitutional issues.

2

crack at those issues before the Second Circuit, and

3

Respondents after all are not simply asking this Court

4

to hold the regulation of isolated expletives is

5

unconstitutional, but that any broadcast indecency

6

regulation is unconstitutional; and at a minimum before

7

this Court entertains that kind of radical

8

constitutional shift, it ought to have the benefit of a

9

court of appeals decision which actually decides those

10

So we certainly want another

issues.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could that be -- could

12

that be done without deciding this APA or are we forced

13

to decide that?

14

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, we think the Court is

15

forced to decide that because that's the basis that the

16

court of appeals has invalidated the Commission's

17

action.

18

incorrect under the APA and send it back for

consideration of the networks' other arguments.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

Alderson Reporting Company

2

and may it please the Court:
I think I would like to start with

3

Justice Scalia's narrowest question in terms of the

4

easiest way to resolve this case, which is did the FCC

5

in its remand order in fact recognize that it had made a

6

change in policy and therefore dealt forthrightly with

7

the fact that it had made a change in policy.

8

is true that the Second Circuit was prepared to accept

9

the idea that the Commission had changed, the reality is

While it

10

you will read that opinion without any ability to

11

discern that.

12

And the need -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but doesn't -- doesn't

13

the ability to discern it come from the reasons given

14

for not assessing fines?

15

assessing fines.

16

effect a warning to everybody that things have changed.

17

Isn't that a pretty clear indication that they are

18

adopting a new policy?

19

They said:

We are not

This is something new, and this is in

MR. PHILLIPS:

It -- well, that they are in

20

fact adopting a new policy, I think that is probably

21

right, Justice Souter.

22

ordinarily when you are in fact forthrightly changing

23

your policy it is incumbent upon the agency to say:

24

are changing our policy, we recognize we are changing

25

our policy, and here is the explanation for why we are

I think the problem here is that

29
Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official - Subject to Final Review

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are they -- are they

supposed to be more virtuous than courts?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

I mean, courts all the

6

time, you know, distinguish prior cases by saying,

7

"well, you know, it was dictum, or we didn't really hold

8

that and whatnot. " And I read their opinion as somewhat

9

the same -- somewhat the same thing.

They acknowledge

10

at the end, and that's why they didn't impose a fine,

11

that although this, you know, nothing that they had done

12

up till now -- although their staff had -- would have

13

misled anybody; still and all, it wasn't all that clear,

14

and therefore we won't impose a fine.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

It seems to me -

The only thing that's

16

strikingly different about that, Justice Scalia, is they

17

are very express in dealing with issue in the Golden

18

Globes order, which -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

It -- General Garre specifically

21

identifies.

It's interesting, when you say where is it

22

in the order under review when they say they are going

23

to do that, he says look in paragraph 12 of the Golden

24

Globes order.

25

this case came to the Second Circuit; the Commission

And Justice Ginsburg is absolutely right:

Alderson Reporting Company

said No, send it back; give us a full opportunity to

2

explain exactly what we are doing.

3

they come in and they don't deal with this issue.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Thy take it back and

Well -- it was also, they

5

said, you know, we sort of made this change without

6

getting comments from the affected parties.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

comments and then -- and then explain.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

That was part of it.
Give us a chance to receive

And then provide a final

11

reviewable order from the Commission, presumably that

12

defends in all respects that decision.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But as I say -

What the Commission

14

said is that the prior decisions or guidance was

15

seriously flawed and we reaffirmed that it was

16

appropriate to disavow it.

17
18
19

It seems to me that is recognizing a change
and rejecting it.

It's at page 82a.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

All -- all I am

20

suggesting, Mr. Chief Justice, is that there is equally

21

an opposite language in which the Commission -- and the

22

Second Circuit acknowledged this, too -- in which the

23

Commission seems to back off whether or not it thinks it

24

has made a change in this particular order.

25

seems unreliable 31

6

they kind of said you can view it as a change because

7

the staff had these decisions, and there was dicta; or

8

it's not a change.

9

whether or not they provided a reasonable explanation

10

That seems to me to
does it

Don't we look at the Commission's order and

It seems to me that

But the point -- important point is

for their current position.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

This Court said in State Farm

12

that when an agency changes its position it is incumbent

13

upon the agency to provide more of an explanation in

14

that context than -- than if it were adopting the

15

position in the first instance.

16

there is -

17

So I think yes, if

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What it says in

18

State Farm -- what it says in State Farm is that an

19

agency's view of what is in the public interest may

20

change either with or without a change in circumstances.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The reason there is

23

a change is they looked at it and they decided it was

24

wrong.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

Well, I -- I think it

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- we wouldn't be having this debate if the Commission

2

had simply dealt with this issue in the same forthright

3

fashion that it did with respect to the Golden Globes

4

order.

5

there is a change, it seems to me quite clear that the

6

Commission has not even remotely satisfied its -- its

7

obligation to demonstrate that that change is not

8

arbitrary and capricious.

9

But even if the Court accepts the idea that

And I think -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You agree it's

10

enough of a justification for the change that they think

11

the other policy was wrong?

12

circumstances have changed, the facts are different;

13

it's enough to say, "well, whatever the Commission used

14

to thing, we think differently"?

They don't have to say

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17
18

And then explain why.
And then explain

why.
MR. PHILLIPS:

And that goes into what I

19

think is the next point that I would like to make which

20

is the answer to the Justice Breyer's question, which is

21

where in the opinion does the Commission explain the

22

change in position with respect to the -- to the first

23

prong of the indecency standard, which is whether or not

24

these words inherently mean either sexual or excretory

25

activities; and there, it seems to me, there is a 33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whether there is a change or not, the reality is that

2

from 1978 until 2004 this kind of language was used

3

routinely, without the Commission remotely suggesting

4

that every time it was used, it necessarily had a

5

particular meaning.

6

language has changed its tone completely, and there is

7

no explanation for what is different or what is the

8

reason for adopting that particular view.

9

that the reading of that is so fundamentally at odds

10
11

And then suddenly in 2004, this

The fact is

with the way the Court JUSTICE SCALIA:

They said that.

They gave

12

the reason for their current belief.

13

when it is used just as a swear word or as an expletive,

14

the reason it has its impact is precisely because it

15

refers to these excretory or sexual activities; that's

16

what -- that's what gives -- gives it its zing.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

They said even

This Court expressly said in

18

Cohen v California, in talking about exactly the same

19

word, that it cannot plausibly be maintained that this

20

vulgar allusion would conjure up such -- up such psychic

21

stimulation.

22

it applies with even more force in 2008.

23

And if the Court would say that in 1970,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's not the

24

Commission's position.

The Commission's position here

25

is not when these words were used, people necessarily
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

thought of a literal meaning; instead, its position is

2

that the reason these words shocked is because of its

3

association with the literal meaning.

4

different question than what was being addressed in

5

Cohen.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's a

Well, all that Cohen says is

7

that you cannot immediately jump -- you -- it wouldn't

8

even remotely strike you that the reason the language is

9

being used is for its particular sexual meaning.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Then why -- why do

11

you think the F-Word has shocking value or emphasis or

12

force?

13
14

MR. PHILLIPS:

The same reason the S-Word

does; it's because in some circles it is inappropriate.

15

16

associated with sexual or excretory activity.

17

what gives it its -- its force.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because it is
That's

19

suppose you can say it, but I don't understand on what

20

basis.

21

no -

There is no empirical support for that.

had given this explanation it would in your judgment

satisfy the arbitrary and capricious standard?

What if the Commission said, you know, our

5

normally apply to non-content.

23

out of this case and similar First Amendment cases,

corner.

And so, if -

MR. PHILLIPS:

But that would only be -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- if we accept your

argument, we have to change the constitutional avoidance

doctrine.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I don't think that's

10

exactly right, Justice Souter, because the

11

constitutional avoidance doctrine is not going to be

12

much of a problem obviously unless there is a grave

13

constitutional threat.

14

the existence of a constitutional issue that suddenly

triggers withdrawal.

When you are dealing in this area, which is

content regulation and restriction on the basis of

content, it seems to me that's inherently a First

19

Amendment problem.

20

it seems to me the agency, even in the APA context, has

21

more of a responsibility, or at least the Court should

22

say it has more of a responsibility to explain.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Not just The Administrative Procedure

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17
18

You are asking for a higher

standard than the APA MR. PHILLIPS:

that we add to the APA when we are dealing with a

particular area.

MR. PHILLIPS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

This Court hasn't had to hold

7

that in any particular context, but the reality is, as a

8

logical matter, if you are thinking about -- you know,

9

there is an -- a restriction on "in accordance with

10

law."

The First Amendment is obviously with law, so you

11

have that limitation.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

Well, maybe sometime

--

And then you have -

MR. PHILLIPS:

position to argue your constitutional issue, but we

18

can't assume that you are right on the Constitution in

applying the APA.

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

this as if you are regulating the price of oil going

MR. PHILLIPS:

But the reality that goes

back to Justice Breyer's question, at the end of the day

21

the important part of this is what explains this

fundamental shift.

criminal statute, which means we are entitled to the

rule of lenity, which means we are entitled to an

with indecency, says that it has to describe or depict

it seems to me in their enforcement decisions, their

to what they are going to say because I listen to their

MR. PHILLIPS:

The context makes

Well, I'm not sure that -- I

describe how children are able to perceive one set of

uses of the word as opposed to another set of uses of

the word.

you are arguing against here, is it?

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

No, because the point we are

making here is that we haven't asked this Court to

10

revisit Pacifica.

And the point is that when you move

11

away from Pacifica, which is the verbal shock treatment

12

formulation, and say, you know, that's perfectly

13

consistent with the First Amendment and with everything

14

that agency decisionmaking requires, and say that's all

15

right -- when you shift from that, which is an enormous

16

switchover, and go into fleeting expletives, then it's a

17

fundamental -- all we're saying is that's a

18

fundamentally different issue and that implicates more

19

serious First Amendment issues, because everybody knows

20

what is something that is verbal shock treatment or at

21

least we know how to stay pretty far away from it;

standards for purposes of what is indecent and what is

judgment about how to serve our audience.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If there is -- if there is

8

a change in the community standards, does that justify a

change in the FCC's policies?

10

And the second question and the reason I ask

that is:

Do you think today the community generally is

more offended by these words or more tolerant of these

words -

Well -

MR. PHILLIPS:

today than it was in -- 30 years ago.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You do, indeed, but you

4

don't have them presented as something that is -- is

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

But the -- I mean I think

13

what Justice Stevens is getting at is:

14

over the last 30 years?

15

would be exactly the opposite, which is they are going

16

to be more and more tolerant of this language; not that

17

they are less tolerant of this language.

18

therefore, there is even less reason for the Commission

19

to have taken the position that it did in this

20

particular context.

21
22

And if anything has changed, it

MR. PHILLIPS:

is not a difference, but I am suggesting that there are

3

-- that the -- that the change over time has -- has made

4

this less of a compelling argument than it would have

5

been, at least in my judgment, in -- in 1978.

6

I would like to make a couple of different,

7

additional points.

8

1978 is that there is much more opportunity for parents

9

to control access for their children because of the V

I haven't looked at the statistics on one-parent

MR. PHILLIPS:

Those factors

Well, but if you put in a

for the 2003 version of this, which would have said PGL,

21

which is for language, children couldn't have gotten on

22

there whether the parents were at home or not.

23

V-chip is a usable and feasible technology and is a less

24

restrictive alternative than the one that we have on the

Well, the NAB amicus brief

23

actually has a pretty good description of a variety of

different instances in which this has -- has occurred.

25

And, of course, the NAB represents obviously the large
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

networks but also all of the individual stations.

2

that, to me at least, makes a compelling argument that

3

you -- you cannot simply have one rule that says:

4

just impose additional costs on everybody.

5

answer to that is that those stations will simply refuse

6

to broadcast.

7

And

Let's

Because the

And to me the best illustration of it, and

8

the one that the public interest, I would hope, would

9

command or demand the Court take account of, is the

10

Vermont public station that refused to broadcast a

11

debate or -- or allow a number of Senatorial candidates

12

to participate in a debate because that candidate had

13

used expletives in a previous public forum, and,

14

therefore, didn't think it could allow that broadcast

15

and take that risk because it can't afford to have the

16

tape-delayed technology that you are talking about.

17

And -- and that to me is the quintessential

18

example.

19

going to get worse once you decide to get past the

20

notion that a fleeting expletive, no matter how it

21

arises, requires to you justify it.

22

But there are loads of them, and it's just

Because we went from a system that said:

23

25

condemn them unless we think its okay.

I think it -- at least to me

21

it's hard.

I don't think so, but I -- I can understand

22

that Pacifica could be read that way, although in

23

pacifica, itself, George Carlin does, in fact, use the

24

fleeting expletive in an explicitly sexual way at -- at

25

times.
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But I -- I think the hardest case, candidly,

2

is the situation where you have a string of expletives,

3

all of which are clearly not designed to reflect

4

anything about sexual activity and what you do in that

5

situation.

6

That is the hardest case.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but I -- I am not -

7

not sure I make my question as clear as I should.

8

are trying to define the term "indecent" -

9
10

MR. PHILLIPS:

If we

Yes.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- does the -- does the

11

number of times the word is used in a particular context

12

make a difference in the definition?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

I apologize.

I didn't -- I

14

misunderstood your question.

15

think the question -- the first prong of the indecency

16

inquiry is whether or not the particular language used

17

does, in fact, describe or depict sexual or excretory

18

activities or organs.

19

And I don't think the number of times in which you use

20

it affects the -

21

No, I don't think so.

And that's the No. 1 inquiry.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

As a matter of statutory

22

definition, if a particular word can describe those

23

activities, it is equally indecent if used for a

24

different purpose?

25

I

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I would have thought
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that, since you were dealing with a statute that is -

2

that imposes criminal sanctions, that if you have those

3

two alternative interpretions available, you have to

4

choose the one that is more favorable to the defendant.

5

And, therefore, you would -- you would say that the -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7

That is the interpretation -

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- would not be indecent.

I am sorry?
-- you should accept.

10

Let's say because one interpretation of an ambiguous

11

word would not be indecent, you are saying the rule of

12

lenity in that sort of approach would require in a

13

criminal case to just adopt that -- that definition?

14
15
16

MR. PHILLIPS:

That would be my argument,

yes, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that -- I mean you are

17

just -- correct me if I am wrong, but your colloquy with

18

Justice Stevens sort of is a way of phrasing the issue

19

in the case.

20

this -- prior to the change, the Commission interpreted

21

"indecency" in terms of indecent practice.

22

Commission is now doing is defining "indecency" in terms

23

of the meaning of a word.

24

from saying indecency is a practice, i.e., a repetition

25

of certain kinds of words, to saying "indecency" is -

Because you are saying, I think, prior to

And what the

It's -- it's relatively going

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is the use of any word which is itself indecent.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I agree with that

3

completely, Justice Souter.

4

you can characterize it.

5

precise verbal formulation we used, but, candidly, that

6

is it and essentially the way Judge Lebal looked at it.

7

And he just said at the end of the day, because I have

8

to defer to the agency, I am going to let them have that

9

interpretation.

10
11

No.

That is exactly how

I mean it may not be the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that is not the

appropriate approach.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let me ask about deferring

13

there.

14

criminal penalty for a violation of this statute, the

15

agency has no role in -- in defining what -- what the

16

terms of the statute mean.

17

You seem to be suggesting that since there is a

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Scalia, the language

18

of the statute itself would suggest that, because the

19

statute says that the Commission may find violate -- may

20

impose certain enforcement actions for people who

21

violate section 1464.

22

statute.

23

That, of course, is a criminal

Therefore, it is not a statute that has been

24

delegated to the agency's broad discretion to decide

25

what falls within that language.

It is within the

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

agency's discretion to choose a penalty that, in fact,

2

enforces that criminal dictate.

3

And to go back to Justice Stevens's

4

position -- I shouldn't give it as your position, it is

5

my position -- but the point, I think, we were

6

discussing, if you have a choice of two ways to read

7

indecency, you have to read it in a way more favorable

8

to the defendant, that precludes the approach that the

9

government has taken in this particular case.

10
11

If there are no further questions, Your
Honor, I would reserve.

12
13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
Phillips.

General Garre you have two minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

17
18

Thank you, Mr.

GENERAL GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

19

First, Justice Scalia, it's on page 82-A of

20

the petition appendix where the Commission acknowledges

21

the change in the order at issue in this case.

22

Justice Breyer, going back to your question

23

about whether the Commission's definition of indecency

24

has changed, it is not and that is made clear at page

25

73-A of the petition appendix where the Commission says,
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

quote, a long line of precedence indicates that the use

2

of the F-Word for emphasis or as an intensifier comes

3

within the subject matter scope of our indecency

4

definition.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

It explained -- I mean, the

6

change I saw was that previously the use of these words

7

as a swear was treated differently from the use of these

8

words as a description.

9

not treated differently.

10

And that after the event, it's

GENERAL GARRE:

It explains on page 74 why

11

the Commission has determined that these words are

12

indecent.

13

uses of these words as potentially indecent under its

14

contextual analysis.

15

The Commission has only treated those literal

We think that Justice Ginsburg's decision

16

for the D.C. Circuit in the Action for Children's

17

Television case provides a road map for resolving this

18

case, where the Court separately addressed the APA

19

question of whether the agency had provided a reasonable

20

explanation and then separated out the constitutional

21

issues, which this Court need not address.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could I ask one question

23

that just occurred to me?

Do you think the use of the

24

word dung, D-U-N-G, would be indecent?

25

GENERAL GARRE:

I think it would probably
60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

qualify under the subject matter definition, but it

2

probably wouldn't be patently offensive under community

3

standards for broadcasting.

4

The one thing that can't be disputed -- in

5

this case is that the F-Word is patently offensive under

6

community standards for the broadcast medium.

7

Court has reversed the decision below on the APA

8

question presented and remand the case for consideration

9

under -

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You have the F-Word in

11

there too, and even Judge Leval says he didn't

12

understand why that word should be on the list.

13

GENERAL GARRE:

This

Well, we certainly think

14

that under community standards that that word is

15

patently offensive as well.

16

that the F-Word itself is clearly patently offensive.

17

We think that the S-Word is patently offensive.

18

Court did so -- we think had that view in the Pacifica

19

case as well, because that, of course, is one of the

20

seven dirty words at issue in that case.

And certainly, but we think

This

21

If there are no further questions.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

The case is submitted.

24

(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the
