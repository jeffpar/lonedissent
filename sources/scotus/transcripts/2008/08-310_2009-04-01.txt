ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court:

11

The Valdez vessel tax violates the

12

Constitution's Tonnage Clause because it operates as a

13

charge on a privilege of trading in the port of Valdez,

14

and that tax is apportioned in a way that is guaranteed

15

to tax extraterritorial values and values that do not

16

have a connection to the city.

17

Process and Commerce Clauses.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That violates the Due

It's not often that we

19

have disagreements as to the basic facts.

The red brief

20

says that the tax in question constitutes 11 percent of

21

the tax base, and you talk about that in the reply

22

brief.

23

outset telling us your views of this tax?

24

it's the Respondent's statement and not yours, do you

25

think 11 percent of the tax base means 11 percent of

Can you spend just a little bit of time at the

Alderson Reporting Company

And although

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what's collected under this tax or under all taxes

2

imposed by City of Valdez?

3

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that it means

4

all taxes that are imposed not only by the City of

5

Valdez, but they are including taxes imposed by the

6

State of Alaska that are collected by the City of

7

Valdez.

8

10

The JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In which case, that seems

really quite irrelevant.
MR. ROTHFELD:

That is our position.

We

11

think that's absolutely right.

12

focus on the nature of this tax.

13

directed exclusively at vessels and not on all vessels.

14

It's -- by exempting small boats and all boats that are

15

engaged in commercial fishing and all boats that dock

16

exclusively at city-owned harbors.

17

18

that falls only on vessels and is directed at those

19

vessels, that -

It is a tax that is

This is a tax, a

think that -- so far as Valdez is concerned, the vessels

we are talking about are subject simply to this property

tax.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, do you -- do you take

3

the position -- let's say that if the State of Alaska

4

taxed all the other property you had mentioned except

5

for the tankers and the city taxed the tankers, that

6

that would by definition be discriminatory tax and/or on

7

some other basis violate the Tonnage Clause?

8
9
10

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, that -- that would be

quite a different situation than what we have here.
Here, the city -

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the reason I raised

12

it was that -- in -- in your response to my first

13

question, you said, well, you didn't think the city was

14

taxing these other -- these other pieces of property,

15

and I'm -- I'm not sure why that is significant.

16

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, there are -- there's a

17

huge universe of personal property that could be taxed

18

in the City of Valdez.

19

all of this property except for a discrete category of

20

oil and gas property that is subject to taxation by the

21

State.

22

personal property -- movable property, personalty -

23

that any jurisdiction can tax.

24

trucks and moving vans and refrigerators and jewelry.

25

Of all those innumerable things that they could tax,

Valdez has the authority to tax

So Valdez can tax all the ordinary kinds of

MR. ROTHFELD:

Not so, Your Honor, because

23

24

there is little practical risk that the State is going

25

to assign the right to tax that property.

That is something of tremendous

6
Alderson Reporting Company

I think that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

How about the risk in the

2

other direction, that the State will simply take over

3

this tax and remit the proceeds to the city?

4

result on your view be the same if it did that?

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

Would the

The result in my view would

6

be the same, but that would be a different and more

7

difficult case.

8

It is -- it has the authority, as I said, to tax the

9

universe of personalty in the City of Valdez.

Here, focus on what Valdez is doing:

It has

10

chosen to tax only particular types of vessels that are

11

used in the export of oil.

12

Imagine, though -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There are other vessels,

13

too.

14

few other vessels that were included?

15
16
17

It's the -- it's the oil tankers, and there are a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Including a -- a cruise

I -

MR. ROTHFELD:

There is -- there is one

18

cruise ship, Your Honor, that was caught up in the net

19

in the first year the tax was imposed.

20

tax falls exclusively on what vessels that are involved

21

in the export of oil -- principally tankers, also

22

service vessels.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Otherwise the

Why does that -- why

24

does that matter?

I mean, do you concede that if this

25

tax were in some sense nondiscriminatory, you would

lose?

2

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, I think that -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why are we having

4

all this talk about -- in other words, you think if

5

there was a tonnage tax applicable to everything -- you

6

know, your pickup truck holds two tons; it has got to

7

pay a certain amount or whatever.

8

win?

9

MR. ROTHFELD:

Then do you lose or

If a -- if a tonnage tax -

10

look at what the tonnage tax was initially designed to

11

do.

12

because at the time -- the time this clause was it was

13

written in the late 18th century, tonnage was the

14

ordinary way of valuing the value of a ship and the

15

ordinary way of imposing tax on a ship.

16

The Framers chose the term "duty of tonnage"

If -- if the City of Valdez were to impose a

17

property tax measured by tonnage on everything -- on

18

vans and trucks and refrigerators and ships -- that

19

would be a difficult case for us.

20

hasn't done that.

21

and it has not imposed a property tax on any other type

22

of property except particular types of vessels.

23
24
25

But, obviously, it

It has not imposed a tonnage tax or

MR. ROTHFELD:

-- it quacks like a duck -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

I think you're

3

giving up an awful lot.

4

couldn't they be have been more concerned about making

5

sure that there is a free flow of commerce, that ships

6

go, and the fact that everything is taxed would be less

7

of a concern to them?

8

say that if it's nondiscriminatory, even if you would

9

call it a "tonnage tax," you lose?

10

I mean, what if the Framers -

But you're -- you're willing to

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I -- I was using a

11

response to the previous question, and actually they

12

were imposing a property tax and they were measuring it

13

in an unusual sort of way.

14

if there's a generally applicable property tax which

15

happens to fall on vessels, the reality of that tax is

16

that it is a tax on property and not a tax on vessels.

17

And the Court has said that

But here we have quite the opposite.

Here

18

we have tax that falls only on vessels as cargo -

19

vessels.

20

concerned with the free movement of commerce.

21

Tonnage Clause was designed to close the loophole that

22

was thought to be left by the Import-Export Clause,

23

which bars the taxation of imports and exports.

24

vessels would be a way of circumventing that.

25

And you're quite right:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The Framers were
The

Taxing

you're -- that a given tanker came into the harbor at

2

Valdez on one occasion and one occasion only.

3

City of Valdez, under its own statutes, by the terms of

4

its own ordinance, tax that ship?

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

Would the

It would, indeed, because the

6

city in its code creating the tax conclusively presumed

7

that a vessel was subject to the tax so long as it takes

8

on cargo worth a million dollars over the course of a

9

year.

Oil tankers -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, let me -- let me just

11

change the question then.

12

of took half a tankful that didn't reach the point of a

13

million dollars' value, there would be no tax then.

14

that correct?

15
16

If -- if it came in and sort

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, it would have to take a

lot less than half a tankful.

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think Whatever it would take to

Yes.

If -- if it were not -

20

if it visited the port of Valdez once and took on less

21

than a million dollars and never came back to the port

22

of Valdez -

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Under the old

24

tonnage laws, wouldn't that ship in the 18th century

25

have been taxed?
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think that they -

2

jurisdictions impose all kinds of different variations

3

of tonnage duties.

4

And as the Court -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the -- the point that

5

I am getting to is -- and I'd -- I'd like you to address

6

this -- one of the arguments on the other side is that

7

one reason this should not be treated as a tonnage tax

8

is that it relies upon the concept of a tax situs.

9

the -- the implication is that not every ship that comes

And

10

into the harbor is going to be subject to the tax;

11

whereas, under the old tonnage laws, any ship that came

12

in would be.

13

that argument?

14

And what is -- what is your response to

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, two responses.

First,

15

I think it is not the case that under the old tonnage

16

laws necessarily every ship was subject to tax.

17

could be subject depending upon how -- how large they

18

were, and some ships could be exempted.

19

not implicit in -- in the nature of a tonnage duty that

20

it applies to every ship that -- that enters the harbor.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Ships

So I think it's

Where do we -- where do we

look to find this out?

practice in the 18th and 19th centuries.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do you know of any source

that we could look at to support the proposition that

3

you just made?

4

MR. ROTHFELD:

I -- I can't point you to any

5

authority directly addressing the point, but I can point

6

you to the general treatment of what a tonnage duty is.

7

I mean, it's a duty which is imposed on vessels on the

8

basis of tonnage.

9

on every vessel that enters the harbor.

It -- it does not have to be imposed
But I think

10

probably the more important response to your question is

May I ask one other

question before you leave this, which is where Justice

5

6

we want to tax all oil and gas property, and here's how

7

we do it.

8

10

Suppose a State says:

In our State,

We assess the value of all oil and gas
Then we

something like that, on all of it.

11

Now, the State will collect all of it, and

12

we make one exception.

13

State will directly get the money from, and then the

14

city can do the rest, if it wants.

15

do with the State money.

16

the city wants to, it can put the same tax on that

17

little bit of property left over, which is a subcategory

18

of oil and gas property.

that little bit of property left over is called "a

20

ship."

MR. ROTHFELD:

with what's going on here and -- and I think this is an

answer to your question -- the City of Valdez has the

And -- and as -- as you

10

described it, the City of Valdez also can impose a tax,

although it doesn't have to, on -- on vessels.

types of property that it could tax, and it imposes a

MR. ROTHFELD:

As you understand it, with

impose a user fee, and the Court has recognized in its

Tonnage Clause decisions that even a -- a tax on cubic

capacity, a tax on weight, would be fine if that is a

roughly equivalent to the value of the services

It could

So that is one way Valdez could do it.
A second way they could do it is to impose a

nondiscriminatory property tax.

13

personal property, that would impose the kind of

want to give short shrift to that, because the Valdez

of the year in Valdez.

3

And, therefore, everybody agrees the

The ordinary way and the way that this Court

4

has approved the apportionment of a tax on physical

5

property -- physical property is straightforward.

6

would put in the numerator of the tax the number of days

with the number of miles they spent in or number of

8

miles traveled in the taxing jurisdiction; you put in

9

the denominator 365, the total number of miles traveled

10

11

of the property.

You

You multiply that fraction times the value

12

And so, for example, if I have a

13

transcontinental passenger train moving from New York to

14

California that spends 20 percent of its time in

15

New York, New York could tax 20 percent of the value of

16

the train.

17

That is not how Valdez does it.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's -- the train

19

is going to be some place throughout its trip, unlike

20

the ship that's going to be on the high seas.

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's right.

But the -- the

Valdez is simply

We are entitled to tax on some concept of where

And so it does not apportion on the basis of

amount of time spent in the jurisdiction over the course

5

of the year, which is the approach that the Court

6

ordinarily has used.

7

the equivalent of New York saying, in my

8

transcontinental train example, we are going to take

9

into account only time spent in New York and Los Angeles

The Valdez approach is precisely

loading and unloading passengers, and we are going to

discount all of the rest of the year, all the rest of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the home port might

3

have had in the old days the notion that's really where

4

5

little to do with where the vessels are berthing and

6

where they are being serviced?

7

But, nowadays, Delaware has very

MR. ROTHFELD:

If I may, Your Honor, I'll --

8

I'll answer that question and sit down to reserve a

9

little bit of time.

You are right as to the physical

10

location of the ship, but the -- the jurisdiction, the

11

authority of a non-domicile to tax has always been

12

constrained by -- under the Due Process Clause -- by the

13

physical location of the property.

14

And so, the fact that the property may or

15

may not be subject to tax somewhere else does not give

16

Valdez additional authority to tax property that's not

17

present there.

18

Now, the Court has said that the domicile,

19

whether or not the property is present, is providing

20

benefits to the owner of the property, and it's those

21

benefits that justify the imposition of the tax for

22

periods when it is not in any tax situs subject to tax

23

by anybody else.

MR. OLSON:

I think -- I think you're

16

correct, Justice Stevens, that what the Framers were

17

concerned about was a substitute for -- export or import

18

tax by taxing what was in the ship, and that tonnage

19

referred to that, but it wasn't the value of the vessel

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Your Honor.

A

couple of quick points.

question of what the State of Alaska does in the nature

16

of its tax.

17

of Alaska imposes this tax through the City of Valdez.

18

That is right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

we ought to regard it as a city tax, not a State tax.

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

they keep it; that sounds like a city tax.

MR. ROTHFELD:

The State

So this is out of Valdez's

Valdez chose to tax only particular types
56

of personal property, and that is vessels.

2

Second, on the question of what the Tonnage

3

Clause was designed to do and -- and the Wheeling case,

4

Wheeling says that a property tax is okay when the tax

5

is imposed on vessels the same as other property owned

6

by its citizens.

7

Contemporaneous understanding of the rule at the time

8

was that taxes that singled out vessels were

9

unconstitutional.

10
11

That is not what is going on here.

We cite authority for this

proposition in our reply brief.
To -- to address Justice Ginsburg's question

12

as to whether there were other taxes like this, we have

13

not found any other tax anywhere that has been imposed

14

singling out vessels as -- for -- for property taxation.

15

Either now or in the past, we have not found any case

16

addressing that, not only not in this Court, but in any

17

other court.

18

And then finally -

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What about the -- the

20

broader tax situation at the -- at the -- in -- in 1789?

21

Did -- did ports have sources of -- or exercise the

22

authority at that time to tax property generally, e.g.,

23

real estate in the city to support the activities of the

24

ports, or were they dependent solely upon things like

25

import-export taxes, et cetera?
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ROTHFELD:

My -- my understanding is

2

that real estate certainly was subject to tax and that

3

ports would have the authority to tax other types of

4

property.

5

by the Tonnage Clause.

6

Vessels were set aside as a particular item

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So -- so that the argument

7

they are taxing other things, therefore it's okay to tax

8

this, would have been an argument just as potent in the

9

18th century or impotent, as the case may be, as it is

10

now?

11

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's right.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

Okay.
And so setting aside vessels

14

in a -- in a unique category when other things could be

15

taxed would have been problematic -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How -- under your

17

view, how is a city supposed to impose a property tax on

18

a vessel?

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

It -- it should impose a tax

20

by imposing a tax on personal property generally.

And

21

if it does, it would fall on vessels as items of

22

personal property.

23

I may, Your Honor, just to finish, what Valdez has -- it

24

could have taxed all of that types of -- or it could

25

have taxed particular types of it.

It -- it is significant -- well, if

58
Alderson Reporting Company

But it has seized on

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only one particular type of personal property to be

2

subject to taxation.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so you think

4

we should resolve the tax by seeing how generally

5

applicable property taxes are in Valdez?

6

MR. ROTHFELD:

I -- I think it's an easy

7

case when, as in this situation, there is only one item

8

of property that is taxed, and that's a vessel.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but your -

10

your brother suggests that other items of property are

11

taxed under other provisions of the tax ordinance.

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Again, Valdez does not.

13

State does.

14

is no need for the Court to go beyond and decide how

15

broadly applicable -- as I suggested earlier, our test

16

would be predominantly on vessels it is

17

unconstitutional, and that clearly is the case here.

18

Valdez does not.
