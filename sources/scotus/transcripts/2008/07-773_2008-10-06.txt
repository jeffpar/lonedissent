ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We will hear

MR. ORTIZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

This case poses two substantive issues:

11

First, whether section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act

12

impliedly repeals section 1331's "well-pleaded

13

complaint" requirement?

14

court look through a petition to compel arbitration that

15

itself contains no Federal question to ground Federal

16

subject matter jurisdiction on a Federal question

17

lurking somewhere in the dispute sought to be

18

arbitrated.

19

Only if it does can a district

And, second, if section 4 does repeal this

20

part of section 1331, can a completely pre-empted

21

State-law counterclaim in a pending State-court lawsuit

22

furnish look-through jurisdiction?

23

Your Honors, at bottom this is ae dispute

24

between two radically different conceptions of Federal

25

question jurisdiction.

One view, Respondents', is so
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

broad as to allow parties to compel arbitration in

2

Federal court of nearly any dispute concerning credit

3

card debt; and one, Petitioner's, narrowly confined

4

subject matter jurisdiction to those disputes where the

5

arbitration agreement itself arguably arises under

6

Federal law.

7

But, Your Honors, the ordinary, the original

8

meaning of section 4, the structure of the overall

9

Federal Arbitration Act, and the purposes of the Federal

10

Arbitration Act all militate strongly in favor of the

11

Petitioner's view of subject matter jurisdiction here.

12

First, the language.

13

agreement," Your Honors, as the words "save for"

14

themselves suggest, necessarily imply that the agreement

15

exerts some negative effect on otherwise existing

16

jurisdiction.

17

The words "save for such

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That simply means

18

that you can't bring an action in Federal court because

19

the agreement says you can't.

20

got to arbitrate.

21

save for such agreement, the question is whether or not

22

you could then bring the action in Federal court.

23

The agreement says you've

So if you throw the agreement out

MR. ORTIZ:

Your Honor, the -- those words

24

"save for such agreement" were originally intended to

25

refer to the hoary doctrine of ouster, which barred the
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Federal courts from subject matter jurisdiction in such

2

suits.

3

itself somehow impairs jurisdiction.

The words "but for" suggest that the agreement

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Ortiz, why isn't

5

section 2 of the Arbitration Act sufficient to take care

6

of the ouster doctrine, whatever may have been left of

7

it?

8
9

MR. ORTIZ:

Your Honor, section 2 says that

an arbitration agreement shall be valid, irrevocable,

10

and enforceable.

11

enacted, the Federal courts were still split between law

12

and equity.

13

such arbitration agreements enforceable, but only in

14

law.

15

that there is no -

16

At the time when section 2 was

Section 2 by itself could well have made

Section 4, "save for such agreement," makes clear

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm not sure that I

17

follow that, because it seems to me -- where did this

18

doctrine of ouster come from?

19

The courts said, no, we won't enforce arbitration

20

agreements if it would oust us of jurisdiction.

21

would a court reading section 2 not say, well, that rule

22

never made any sense in the first place, so we're not

23

going to follow it?

24

imposed on the courts.

25

MR. ORTIZ:

It came from the court.

Why

It's not any rule that Congress has

Your Honor, section 2 by itself
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would not have made clear that in -- such agreements

2

were enforceable in equity.

3

Tobey v. County of Bristol, bills in equity were thought

4

in the Federal courts to be ill-founded in point of

5

jurisdiction to support a motion to compel arbitration.

6

And so although under section 2 such an agreement might

7

be enforceable in law -- damages might be available,

8

penalty clauses might be enforced in law, a party might

9

also be able to recover the expenses incurred in an

As Justice Story wrote in

10

arbitration that was revoked before the arbitration came

11

to its conclusion -- that would not be clear that -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

historic model.

14

enforced on the courts.

15

That may have been the

This was never a notion that Congress
They imposed it on themselves.

So my question remains why shouldn't the

16

Court then say this agreement has been declared

17

enforceable, the ouster doctrine didn't have much to

18

recommend it in the beginning, but certainly not any

19

more; we can change it?

20

MR. ORTIZ:

No, Your Honor.

It is true that

21

Congress in the Federal Arbitration Act abrogated the

22

ouster doctrine.

23

would do so by itself or whether section 4 was necessary

24

because of the division between law and equity at the

25

time.

The only question is whether section 2

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm just not getting the --

2

I have never understood this argument and I still don't

3

understand it now.

4

that would seem to leave it inadequate to touch equity

5

as well as law?

6

What is it in the text of section 2

MR. ORTIZ:

Your Honor, section 2 says that

7

arbitration agreements shall be valid, irrevocable and

8

enforceable, but it does not say how they could be

9

enforced.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Exactly.

And why,

11

therefore, would anyone -- why would anyone be drawing

12

distinctions as to how?

13

way that an agreement might appropriately be enforced in

14

the courts of the United States at the time -- or any

15

courts, for that matter, at the time the act was passed.

16

MR. ORTIZ:

It would be enforceable in any

Your Honor, if Congress wanted

17

to be very clear that ouster in all of its forms was no

18

longer any kind of issue in enforcing arbitration

19

agreements, it took the extra step in section 4.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21

statement in section 2.

22

clearer than that?

23

MR. ORTIZ:

It -- it made a categorical

Why did it need to be any

Well, because, Your Honor, it

24

would be the case that arbitration agreements could be

25

enforceable, but just not enforceable in the way that
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

might be most helpful.

2
3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it could be, but why

in the world would anyone draw that inference?

4

MR. ORTIZ:

Your Honor, because there were

5

separate bars at law and equity at the time -- at the

6

time of ouster.

7

jurisdictions for there to be enforcement, not across

8

the board.

9

at the time against jurisdiction.

10

Under law, there was some room in some

In equity there was an even higher standard

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I have the same problem

11

that Justice Souter does, especially since section 2

12

refers to equity.

13

enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or

14

in equity for the revocation of any contract.

15

It says they will be irrevocable and

Obviously this -- this section was meant to

16

apply to equitable actions.

17

in law for a -- a ground that only existed in equity?

18

MR. ORTIZ:

You wouldn't dismiss them

But that particular section,

19

Justice Scalia, is meant to refer to ordinary State

20

contract doctrines in law and equity, which would make

21

the overall contract unenforceable.

22

language is specifically directed at ouster, which is a

23

jurisdictional doctrine rather than one of substantive

24

contract law.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The "save for"

I don't know.
8

Alderson Reporting Company

When it says

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they are enforceable and makes an exception only for

2

grounds that enable revocation in law or in equity, I

3

would -- I would think that the general command was

4

meant to apply to both law and equity.

5

MR. ORTIZ:

Your Honor, the Respondents'

6

view also doesn't take into account the other provisions

7

of the Federal Arbitration Act itself.

8

view, the "save for" language is literally read out of

9

section 4 of the agreement, since the rest of section 4

Under their

10

would accomplish exactly what they think the

11

look-through doctrine that they are arguing for without

12

those four critical words.

13

Also, sections 203 and sections 205 show

14

that when Congress wanted to expand subject matter

15

jurisdiction, it knew how to do so clearly and

16

unequivocally.

17

Section 205 in 1970 -

18

And in fact, when Congress adopted

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I hate to interrupt you

19

here, but would you explain why the words "save for such

20

agreement" cut back on the jurisdiction?

21

understand your point.

22

MR. ORTIZ:

I didn't quite

Justice Stevens, the point is

23

that "save for such agreement" instructs a court to jump

24

over the historical ouster doctrine.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Doesn't it just instruct

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the court to decide whether, if there were no such

2

agreements, would there be Federal jurisdiction in the

3

underlying dispute?

4

MR. ORTIZ:

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6
7

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.
So in this case there

would be.
MR. ORTIZ:

No, Your Honor, because the

8

underlying dispute between the parties in this case is

9

a -- concerns the arbitration agreement, not the

10
11

underlying bank debt.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, it's not the

12

underlying bank debt, but it is an underlying dispute

13

over which this Federal -- if you had brought your class

14

action as an original case, there would have been

15

Federal jurisdiction.

16

MR. ORTIZ:

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18
19

Yes, Your Honor.
So then why doesn't the

language read on this case?
MR. ORTIZ:

Well, Your Honor, the language

20

in -- the language -- the particular language of section

21

4 is meant to say, save for such agreement but for the

22

doctrine of ouster, setting aside the ouster doctrine

23

whether there would be -

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The text says nothing

about the ouster doctrine.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

MR. ORTIZ:

No.

But read in its historical

context, Your Honor -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

MR. ORTIZ:

Rather than literally.

Well, literally at the time it

5

would have been understood to refer -- to refer to that,

6

because ouster was the whole problem against which FAA

7

itself was first enacted.

8
9

FAA -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
it's a tough sell.

This is a tough -

When you say "save for such

10

agreement," which I agree with Justice Stevens seems to

11

me you've put the agreement aside and then you say right

12

away then you look at the agreement to see if there is

13

Federal jurisdiction and only the agreement, not through

14

that.

15

right back in.

So you're throwing it out and then you bring it

16

It seems -

MR. ORTIZ:

Not quite, Your Honor.

What -

17

the rest of that sentence in section 4 instructs the

18

court to look at a suit concerning the subject matter in

19

controversy, which would be a suit seeking specific

20

performance of the arbitration.

21
22
23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of the arbitration

agreement?
MR. ORTIZ:

Yes, sir.

So you are -- what

24

the court is instructed to do under the "save for such

25

agreement" clause is to ignore the historical problem of
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ouster and then to see whether in a suit brought to

2

specifically enforce the arbitration agreement, there

3

would be Federal subject matter jurisdiction.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

And I guess

5

it's -- I mean, you say if it said save for the historic

6

doctrine of ouster, then it would be easy to say, and

7

then you look at the arbitration agreement.

8

"save for such agreement" and then you look at the

9

agreement.

10

MR. ORTIZ:

But it says

Well, you're not quite looking

at the agreement.

ouster was the problem being referred to in those four

words in section 4.

section 4 proceeding, which was completely novel at the

17

time.

18

And this makes clear, I believe, that

It says a suit arising out of a

It's instructing the Federal courts to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You just -- you just used

19

the words "arising out of the controversy."

"The

20

controversy" is used in several sections of the

21

Arbitration Act, and "the controversy" in other contexts

22

means the underlying dispute between the parties.

23

controversy" is not over the enforcement of the

24

arbitration agreement.

25

MR. ORTIZ:

With all respect, Justice
12

Alderson Reporting Company

"The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Ginsburg, it's a little bit more complicated than that.

2

The Federal Arbitration Act uses the word "controversy"

3

four times, twice in section 2, once in section 4 and

4

once in section 5.

5

In section 2, the word "controversy" is

6

embedded in a larger phrase:

7

of such contractor transaction."

8

the word "controversy" that makes clear that in section

9

2, both instances in section 2, it is referring to the

10

"Controversy arising out
It is that context for

dispute which is sought to be arbitrated.

11

In section 5, by contrast, the simple word

12

which appears the middle of 4A of the Petitioner's

13

brief, either -- section 5, which deals with the

14

appointment of arbitrators or umpires, it says "either

15

party to the controversy", it's clear in the section 5

16

context that the word "controversy" by itself refers to

17

the controversy over arbitration, not to the underlying

18

dispute.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

In Moses H. Cone, didn't the

20

court say that the controversy was the underlying

21

dispute?

22

MR. ORTIZ:

Your Honor, that -- this Court,

23

in that footnote 32 of Moses H. Cone, mentioned language

24

that refers to the underlying dispute.

25

of both the sentence, the footnote itself, and the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

In the context

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

overall case, it is clear that the Court could not have

2

meant that.

3

That phrase is followed immediately by a

4

semicolon and then the word "hence."

5

"hence" in that same sentence in the same footnote, this

6

Court says, "Hence an independent basis for jurisdiction

7

needs to exist," which in context makes it clear that

8

it's not referring to look through.

9

And after the word

to the other cases in it.

12

13

independent basis of jurisdiction exists, not that there

14

is look through.

15

Federal-question jurisdiction says that the Federal

16

issue has to appear on the face of the complaint.

17

They basically show that an

And, in fact, one of them dealing with

The rest of footnote 32, Your Honor, is all

18

directed towards -- towards the jurisdictional inertness

19

of the FAA overall.

20

itself, if look through had been rigorously adopted

21

there, it would have defeated subject-matter

22

jurisdiction because there would not have been complete

23

diversity among the parties.

24
25

And the case of Moses H. Cone,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you do think -

you do think we should look through to determine
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

diversity and the amount in question?

2

not in the Federal-question context, but if it's

3

diversity, you say we do look through the arbitration

4

agreement.

5

MR. ORTIZ:

In other words,

Your Honor, that seems a

6

somewhat different sense of look through; but, to the

7

extent that ordinary, background 1331 or 1332 principles

8

authorize such look through, that is appropriate in

9

arbitration cases as much as it is appropriate outside

10
11

of arbitration cases.
It is Petitioner's contention that section 4

12

has no independent look-through force.

13

that look through is appropriate, it is because it is

14

appropriate under section 1332, itself.

15

Respondents' view section 4 operates independently to

16

authorize look through, then it would presumably

17

override 1332's normal principle that you do not look

18

through in determining complete diversity.

19

have the overall effect of paradoxically reducing the

20

number of petitions to compel on the diversity side that

21

could be brought in Federal court.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To the extent

If under

And it would

Say that again.

I didn't

follow that.
MR. ORTIZ:

The -- the point is a simple

one, but it's sometimes hard to express.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

If you -- if

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this Court says that section 4 operates independently to

2

authorize look through in section 1331 and section 1332,

3

the courts, district courts, will be in the position of

4

looking through section 1332 petitions to determine

5

whether the parties are completely diverse.

6

It will not be basing the complete diversity

7

determination on the parties before it in the

8

arbitration -- in the petition to compel, itself, but it

9

will be looking through to the underlying dispute.

10

Now, in Moses H. Cone, if the Court had done

11

that, it would have picked up the architect who was

12

dropped from the actual -- between the actual underlying

13

lawsuit and the petition to compel arbitration, and

14

completeness of diversity would have been defeated

15

there.

MR. ORTIZ:

Was that point argued in that

I do -- I do not know, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why wouldn't 1332

22

require complete diversity and require the court to

23

assure itself of that anyway?

24
25

MR. ORTIZ:

No, Your Honor.

The question -

1332 does not authorize look through for purposes of
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

determining completeness of diversity, so if section 4

2

independently authorizes -

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought you said it did

have a look through, an automatic look through, itself.

5

MR. ORTIZ:

Not under the completeness of

6

diversity, Your Honor.

To the extent it has anything

7

equivalent to look through, it's on the amount-in

8

controversy side of Section 1332.

9
10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I see.

I see.

You are -

you are -- you are limiting it to the amount.
MR. ORTIZ:

Yes.

So, under Respondents'

12

view, there would be -- section 4 would authorize a look

13

through one part of section 1332 and not with respect to

14

another part of section 1332 under -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I am not -- I mean just --

16

I have to be sure I follow.

Why couldn't it require the

17

same look through in a diversity case as it does in a

18

Federal-question case?

19

MR. ORTIZ:

Because, Your Honor, if this

20

Court authorizes look through in Federal-question cases

21

through the arbitration agreement, itself, to the

22

underlying dispute, then if that look -- and that look

23

through comes -- authorization comes from Section 4 -

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

MR. ORTIZ:

Right.

-- then in 1332 cases, this
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court would be looking through not only for

2

amount-in-controversy purposes -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

MR. ORTIZ:

5

Complete diversity.

-- but also for complete

diversity.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7

MR. ORTIZ:

What's wrong with that?

Well, that would have the

8

effect, Your Honor, of not allowing the petitioner to

9

define the contours of the lawsuit and would actually

10

reduce the number of section 1332 petitions that could

11

be brought in Federal court.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

13

MR. ORTIZ:

Maybe it would.

So what?

Well, Your Honor, if that is -

14

that is an implication that is -- is lurking in

15

Respondents' position, and it is also -- in a case like

16

this it is a little bit worrying as to why ordinary

17

section 1332 principles should not apply.

MR. ORTIZ:

14

MR. ORTIZ:

Why?

Well, because, Your Honor,

16

someone could not bring a section 4 petition in Federal

court against maybe one party seeking to force that

18

party into arbitration if there are other parties

19

involved in the underlying dispute where there is no

All right.

So you define

22

"look through" as -- under our hypothetical here as

23

looking through to all people who might potentially be

24

parties under this arbitration agreement.

25

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, that would be the
19

implication of taking the kind of look-through theory

2

that Respondents are arguing for in this case and

3

applying it evenhandedly.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I will think about that.

5

I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't -- it wasn't clear to me that

6

that was so.

7

MR. ORTIZ:

But, Your Honor, there are also

8

several jurisdictional gaps in the act that are created

under Respondents' view.

10

The critical -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I hold up just a

second to make sure I understand it.

16

the look-through doctrine, you would say, well, the

dispute is between A and B and C; and so you would be

depriving A of their right to frame their own complaint

19

in a way that doesn't create Federal jurisdiction.

Exactly, Your Honor, and that But that's not quite so,

22

because the -- the action could proceed with just A and

23

C, and then it -- it could come to a complete judgment

24

as to them.

25

that are involved, the action couldn't possibly proceed

In the look through for the -- the claims

20
Alderson Reporting Company

1

without taking account of the pre-emption claim that the

2

Federal -- the Federal claim.

3

You couldn't -- you could decide the case

4

completely in No. 1, the diversity case, but not in No.

5

2.

6

you don't decide it completely as to all parties.

So there -- so there is a difference.

7

MR. ORTIZ:

It's true,

When the -- no, Your Honor.

8

But there -- there could under your situation be large

9

parts of the underlying dispute that are not covered

10

under -- and still left to be decided.

11

not the case that necessarily everything would be

12

subject to arbitration.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It is, you know,

Of course, I suppose

14

how that works depends on what the rules are about how

15

you frame the dispute once you do look through.

16

I mean, if there is a pending State suit

17

between A and B, even though C may -- you could have

18

sued C as well, I mean the judge can say, well, I am

19

only going to look through to what the -- the actual

20

litigation is; and if I look at that, that's not a

21

Federal case.

22

follows.

23

And -- and -- and so your position

MR. ORTIZ:

This Court could; and,

24

interestingly, that wasn't the situation in Moses H.

25

Cone, itself.

There, there was a preexisting lawsuit,
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and this Court did not look through.

2

that there was no problem with the architect being

3

absent from the petition to compel arbitration, itself.

4

The court found

Well, Your Honors, there is also, as I

5

mentioned, strange jurisdictional gaps that are created

6

under Respondents' view of this case.

7

only section of the arbitration -- in the Federal

8

Arbitration Act that has the critical "save for such"

9

language, which under Respondents' view authorizes

Section 4 is the

10

look-through jurisdiction, in particular, Sections 7, 9,

11

10, and 11, which allow a court, a Federal court, to

12

compel the attendance of witnesses at ab arbitration.

13

That is Section 7; and then 9, 10, and 11, which

14

respectively allow a Federal court to confirm, vacate,

15

or modify an arbitration once it has happened.

16

None of those sections contain language

17

which under Respondents' view or the Fourth Circuit's

18

view are necessary for there to be look through.

19

In all those cases -- situations, Your

20

Honor, the Federal courts would be in the position of

21

being able to compel arbitration under section 4 but not

22

being able to compel the attendance of witnesses at the

23

arbitration or to subsequently confirm, vacate, or

24

modify an award coming from an arbitration that they,

25

themselves, compelled.

Coming from an arbitration that they

themselves compelled.

3

sort of explaining this or trying to jump or leap over

4

this gap, are two amici, two law professors, who argue

5

that this Court should find jurisdiction, subject matter

6

jurisdiction under sections 7, 9, 10 and 11 as an

7

emanation from sections 3 and 4, only one of which

8

actually has the necessary "save for" language.

9

The closest Respondent comes to

Also, Your Honors, this look-through

10

approach to Federal subject matter jurisdiction violates

11

the core purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act.

12

Federal Arbitration Act was meant to get things to

13

arbitration quickly and to have arbitrators, not judges,

14

decide them.

15

jurisdictional inquiries undermine both those aims.

of section 4 could be rewritten this way.

error if you have to rewrite the statute to get to your

doesn't look very much like section 4 to me.
MR. ORTIZ:

Your Honor, if his rewriting,

trying to make it clear to present context what was

16

originally understood at the time the Congress

17

originally enacted the FAA.

18

historical memory or otherwise, of the ouster doctrine,

19

no realization how it actually played out; and against

that absence of knowledge, Judge Marcus is trying to

educate his readers and the lower courts as to how

22

things need to be done.

There is no memory,

that it was closer, coming -- the law and equity across

jurisdiction in the Tobey case to build equity seeking

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6

9

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Mr. Phillips.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
It seems to me that if the argument that
just ended doesn't prove anything, it suggests that

10

perhaps the Court ought to follow the simple expedient

11

of read the statute as it's written, apply it as written

12

and come to what strikes me, at least, as a reasonably

13

easy resolution of this particular case.

14

The statute says that a party aggrieved by

15

the alleged failure to arbitrate -- and we have that

16

precisely in this case because the other side has filed

17

a lawsuit against our indemnitee arising out of an

18

underlying dispute -- may petition any United States

19

district court which, save for such an agreement -- it's

20

pretty clear that everybody agrees that in this context

21

you just simply put the agreement aside -- and then you

22

say would have jurisdiction under Title 28 in a civil

23

action of the subject matter of the suit arising out of

24

the controversy between the parties.

25

It seems to me reasonably clear to interpret
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that language as saying you look to the underlying

2

dispute between the parties.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

dispute between the parties?

6

But that's the question

What is the underlying

It seems to me that your look-through

argument is look-through only halfway.

That is, if you

Justice Ginsburg, the

And the

brought this as an affirmative lawsuit it would have

3

arisen under Federal law.

4

It seems to me that's as clear a concession

5

that the nature of this dispute is a question of Federal

6

law.

And therefore -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Who gets to frame -

8

who gets to frame the complaint?

Normally if you're a

9

party and you have a dispute that may implicate Federal

10

law, you have control over the complaint.

11

have to have a -- you don't have to well plead it in a

12

way that implicates a Federal question.

13

of your way to do it in a way that does not implicate a

14

Federal question; and therefore it would not be, you

15

could not bring it in Federal court.

You don't

You can go out

Just as in the diversity example, you can

specifically avoid suing people who would create

jurisdiction or not; and how does the judge decide

21

whether to sue diverse parties or not to sue diverse

22

parties?

23

But in your position the judge has to in his

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think what the judge has to

24

do is to take -- is to give the plaintiff in the section

25

4 complaint the benefit of his allegations.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

And we have

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

made an allegation here that the subject matter of this

2

dispute arises under Federal law, and we did that not

3

just based on our own assessment of the situation in the

4

abstract, but we did that on the basis that she had

5

filed a very specific claim against us asserting that we

6

had violated essentially section 20.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- but she chose to

8

assert it only defensively; and it's not a complaint -

9

the counterclaim if it had been brought as an

10

independent action, everybody agrees qualifies for

11

Federal jurisdiction.

12

claim is asserting it only as a defense to a claim that

13

you admit does not qualify for Federal jurisdiction.

14

But the litigant who has this

MR. PHILLIPS:

But Justice Ginsburg, I think

15

the difference is that we are not seeking to remove her

16

original lawsuit.

17

then I think the argument you're making is a legitimate

18

one.

19

independent section 4 rights and that's not at all

20

dependent on the -

21

That's not -- if that were the case,

All we are seeking to do is to assert our

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in the practical

22

effect, what happens?

Now you have asserted that you

23

can enforce because of the counterclaim that asserts -

24

that arises under Federal law.

25

the same as removal because the underlying claim, your

But you say it's is not

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suit on the debt owed, remains in Federal -- State

2

court; but what happens to that claim once you have this

3

arbitration?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there are a couple

5

possibilities.

I mean, first of all, the arbitration

6

agreement is quite explicit in saying that if, if you -

7

if this starts off as litigation and then a subsequent

8

claim is made by either of the parties, the parties have

9

the right to enforce the arbitration as to that

10

particular claim.

11

this particular case.

12

So that's specifically what we did in

So in theory, at least the collection action

13

would remain in State court as a State cause of action,

14

although it would certainly be available to the

15

Petitioner in this case to say, well, no, if you're

16

going to arbitrate that portion of the case then I'm

17

content to arbitrate the rest of the case as well.

18

they could do it that way or we could arbitrate the

19

Federal law.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So

Mr. Phillips -

I'm sorry?
Clear up one thing for me.

23

Is it correct, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, that the

24

counterclaim was purely defensive?

25

additional relief?

Didn't it ask for

The counterclaim, wasn't it a class

action?

2
3

MR. PHILLIPS:
exactly.

Yeah -- no -

That's absolutely true.

4
5

Oh, right.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So it was not merely an

defense to the action, the State court action.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I meant -- I didn't mean

to say you couldn't get affirmative relief on a

I -- I understand

20

that, Justice Ginsburg, but the -- the -- but the point

21

I am trying to make here is that the language of section

22

4 just talks about the subject matter of the controversy

23

between the parties.

24

25

existence of a specific lawsuit.

MR. PHILLIPS:

But -- no -- well, I mean you

10

could -- you can certainly view it as part of the same

controversy, but the -- but the bottom line is, the

12

question is:

13

over the dispute that arises under Federal law between

14

the Petitioner and the Respondents?

15

clearly yes.

16

Would a Federal court have jurisdiction

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the answer is

What is the dispute?

You

17

say the dispute is not defined by what -- what has been

brought in a complaint.

19

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

It's defined by our complaint

in section 4.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

argument, I would gather that a court would be able to

23

imagine a counterclaim.

24

what -- what -- what the principal complaint is about,

25

the court could imagine that there would be a

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I'm not sure -- I'm not

even sure -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's very strange to decide

5

Federal jurisdiction on the basis of -- of imagined -

6

imagined complaints.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I mean the problem

8

with that -- I mean the difficulty arises, Justice

9

Scalia, because the language of the statute does say

10

that the court has to determine whether it would have

11

jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy.

12

And then that -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the problem with his --

14

I mean with his interpretation, you don't have to

15

imagine anything.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, with his

17

interpretation, you have to imagine everything.

18

point of fact, you have to imagine that this had

19

something to do with ouster when it doesn't use the word

20

"ouster."

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

In

Well It has to do with equity and

23

law when it uses "equity" and "law" in other contexts.

24

And -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't have to imagine

33
Alderson Reporting Company

complaints.

2

You -- you don't have to invent litigation.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, no.

That's true, but

3

what it -- but -- but the flip side of that is that this

4

is a section, a fundamental provision, of the Federal

5

Arbitration Act that apparently was designed to provide

6

a basis of Federal jurisdiction for the Gila Indian

7

Tribe claims.

8

Congress had that narrow an interpretation of section 4

9

in mind when it passed this particular law.

10

It seems inconceivable to me that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's close to inconceivable

11

to me that Congress wanted us to -- to construct

12

litigation that is not yet in existence.

MR. PHILLIPS:

But I think all of this

really is talking -- I mean this is not significantly

different -

-- answer that the

litigation does exist.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, but your position is it

20

doesn't have to exist.

Had that litigation not been

21

brought, had the motion to arbitrate been brought before

22

a lawsuit was filed, that the court would still have to

consider what is the dispute between the parties and

what kind of complaints could that dispute have

generated.

21

that the bottom-line question is:

22

bring an action under section 4?

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it still seems to me
Are you entitled to

So your theory -- I mean

24

basically I think you concede that the other side has a

25

point in sometimes it will be difficult to say what the
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

dispute is precisely and, therefore, difficult to know

2

if precisely this dispute does or does not -- one that

3

you can get into Federal court on.

4

hasn't even arisen.

5

I guess what would happen, what the judge should say is

6

they should say to you you'd like to have this in

7

Federal court, wouldn't you, this dispute?

8

about?

9

You know, there is no lawsuit.

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

For example, it
And

What's it

Right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And once he says what's it

11

about, both sides will say, well, basically it started

12

off -- it's just about collecting some money from

13

in-state parties.

So that's not Federal.

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that, you know,

16

something could happen here.

17

could decide they want to sue in a big class action and

18

get huge amounts of money under usury laws of the State

19

which don't exist, so they have to proceed under an FDIC

20

reg, and then it could be Federal.

21

say to you:

22

would be up to the judge.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24
25

"What?

It could happen that they

And the judge might

You're just imagining."

And that

Right, and the judge would

have the discretion to decide JUSTICE BREYER:

It's a kind of a defense.

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

Right.
But you'd say then it might

be the case that it wouldn't be so hard to decide.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

There could be a

5

letter that says, look, what you're doing here violates

6

Federal law, and if you don't stop it, we are going to

7

take action against you.

8

and wait.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10
11

And then we have to sit there

MR. PHILLIPS:

A real suit.

And -

But they are here.

They are

here.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And in a real suit, there

13

is a class action brought not just on behalf of the one

14

you're trying to sue but on behalf of everybody, where

15

they have to proceed under a Federal reg, and they are

16

going to get a huge amount of money, and you say that's

17

what we want arbitrated.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

we've asked for here, Justice Breyer.

20
21

And that's precisely what

JUSTICE BREYER:
to figure out.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

So this one is not so hard

Right.
There might be some that

are.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, and there's no
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

question about that, and it's CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What's hard to

3

figure out, you have, let's say, a franchisee, and you

4

have a dispute with the franchisor.

5

says it's an antitrust violation, and I'm going to sue

6

you under the California antitrust law, and he does.

7

And the Federal court says, we've looked through and

8

says, well, you could have sued under the Federal

9

antitrust law.

And you --

And the franchisee

yes, I could have; I

10

deliberately didn't.

11

something that could have been brought in Federal court.

12

And that really deprives a plaintiff of his right to

13

frame his complaint as he sees fit.

14

And then they say, well, this is

MR. PHILLIPS:

And I understand that,

15

Mr. Chief Justice.

16

not sure how I would come out in that particular -

17

And in the right case, you know, I'm

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, in his case, in the

18

Chief Justice's case, wouldn't you say they don't get

19

into court, probably don't because they are bringing

20

this under a State law?

21
22
23

MR. PHILLIPS:

You see, I would comply with

the original complaint.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

But you just

24

say, is the dispute one that could have been brought in

25

Federal court?
40
Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a violation of

the Sherman Act.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

Well, that's exactly

what the Eleventh Circuit held.

3
4

Right.

Right.
Of course, it could

be brought in Federal court.

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well -- and in the right

9

case, the Federal -- you know, if I had to go that far,

10

I might well make that argument, Mr. Chief Justice, but

11

in this case I don't have to go that far.

12

all the Court needs to resolve is in a situation where

13

the parties have a very concrete dispute between them,

14

one that arises exclusively under Federal law, and a

15

party seeks to have that claim arbitrated under section

16

4 pursuant to -

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

24
25

That claim doesn't Let me get one fact.

I'm sorry.
Is the State court suit

still pending?

22
23

And I think

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, the State court suit is

pending.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

So there are two separate

underlying actions.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

The State court has stayed

2

its hand pending the outcome of the Federal litigation.

3

So we'll see what happens.

4

But, obviously, as I say -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there could be

5

nothing left for the State court to do after you have

6

the arbitration.

7

interest due on a nonexistent debt.

8

have the two things together.

9

I mean, not that you arbitrate about

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, you have to

Well, I mean, in some ways,

10

as I say, it seems to me that's Petitioner's right or

11

potentially -- or ours.

12

to have that arbitrated, but the truth is if you took -

13

I suppose either side could ask

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I just can't envision a

14

case where what you haven't effected is taking a case, a

15

debt, simple debt, no diversity a State court case.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you remove the State

18

court from the picture and gotten it over into Federal

19

court to order the arbitration and any follow-up to the

20

arbitration.

21

accomplished what you could not have accomplished by the

22

-- by removal, which you admit that you can't remove on

23

the basis of a counterclaim.

24
25

It just seems to me you have effected -

MR. PHILLIPS:
think that's not right.

But see, Justice Ginsburg, I
I think that actually what
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

happens is you eliminate what I perceive to be the

2

Federal question in this through the arbitral process.

3

You still have the underlying collection

4

action.

5

the usury laws, you have not overcharged, you have not

6

made any mistakes, the question we still have is a claim

7

on the debt and her obligation to pay it.

8
9

If the Court says, no, there is no violation of

Now, whether she wants to adjudicate that in
State court or resolve it as part of the arbitral

10

process, that's really up to her as far as how that

11

goes.

12

plainer in saying that you can divide up the claims for

13

purposes of seeking arbitration, and that seems to fit

14

perfectly well with an effort to say that there is a

15

specific claim here that arises exclusively under

16

Federal law, and that, therefore, we can enforce our

17

arbitration rights pursuant to that section 4 right.

18
19
20

But the arbitration agreement could not be

And that's, frankly, all we are trying to
accomplish here, Justice Ginsburg.
The second part of the statute which is

21

the -- you know, the one that has obviously created the

22

greatest amount of controversy here, is, you know,

23

"would have jurisdiction over the subject matter."

24

Again, it seems to me that this is the easiest case the

25

Court is going to face in this area, because here is one
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where there is no question -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

That's what worries me.

4

(Laughter.)

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what worries me.

If we accept your theory,

6

this is the easiest case, what about the hard cases that

7

are further down the line?

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think what's going to

happen -- I candidly don't think they are going to come

10

up that much, in part because these issues have been

11

around a long time.

12

been dozens of these kinds of issues arising over time.

13

I don't think it's likely to be that big a problem.

14

But again, it seems to me that district

You know, it's not like there have

15

courts have the authority to resolve this, because if

16

they don't believe that there really is a Federal claim

17

that would justify exercise of section 4, they can say

18

that.

19

it.

20

If they do, then they will -- then they will send

I mean, look -- the other thing about this

21

is, you know, the other side makes a big fuss about

22

federalism, but we are not asking to take the issues

23

away from the Federal court -- from the State courts to

24

the Federal courts.

25

everybody has agreed to here, which is to have these

What we are asking for is what

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disputes resolved by arbitration.

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you could have asked

for that in the State court as well, and -

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

There is no question about

5

that, Justice Ginsburg.

6

some lack of confidence in the State courts that we will

7

get the same treatment under section 4 that we would get

8

in Federal court.

9
10

The problem is that there is

And Congress created that right.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then bring that up here on

appeal from the State court.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I wish it were that

12

easy to get this Court to grant review of everything

13

that I bring up here in the first place.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

You don't have any

trouble.

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I appreciate that.
It's not really -- of

19

getting constants from Federal judges; the arbitrators

20

can decide this question.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23
24
25

Right.
The arbitrator might

decide there is no preemption.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But the -- and that's

fine and we have to live with that.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

And obviously,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

since we can't change the standards of review on the

2

back end under sections 9, 10 and 11, we are going to be

3

pretty much stuck with that -- with that determination.

4

But the truth is the bigger risk is that the trial

5

judge, the State court will not send it to arbitration.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this, I haven't

7

reread the Moses Cone case, but is your adversary

8

correct in saying that there would have been no

9

jurisdiction in that case it we followed your view?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12
13

No.
Because the arbitrator was

not of diverse citizenship from the other parties?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, It wasn't litigated.

14

It's not clear on the face of the opinion.

15

is something he knows that I don't know, maybe.

16

I -- I -- certainly nothing in there that reflects

17

that -- that view of the world.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So if there
But

But -- if, in fact, were a

19

nondiverse party in the Moses Cohen, there should have

20

been no jurisdiction?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, now, the nondiverse

22

party issue, it depends on how you read section 4.

23

know, section 4 talks about the parties.

24

parties there I don't think means parties to the

25

underlying controversy.

You

And the

I think there parties refers
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

specifically to the dispute in front of the court.

2

So I don't think the pass-through problem

3

for 1332 applies in that particular context for complete

4

diversity.

5

I don't think Congress envisioned you would

6

look beyond the immediate dispute under section 4 to see

7

whether there are additional parties, except to the

8

extent, obviously, that you would have necessary and

9

indispensable party litigation that might bring them in.

10

I think the assumption is you take the

11

complaint as it's written, and then you look to see

12

whether or not there is amount of controversy.

13

you have to go beyond because the dispute with respect

14

to arbitration is not going to get you anywhere near

15

that number.

16

questions to see whether or not there is a Federal issue

17

there to be enforced.

18

For that

And you have to look beyond for Federal

I'm asking

19

if it may sound favorable to you, then I'll get a good

20

response in rebuttal.

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm not going to give a good

response?

If you read it the other

way -- if you read it the other way, the way the

25

Petitioners want to read it, then is this so or not?
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

That then you look to see if there is Federal

jurisdiction of the arbitration agreement; is that

right?

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

Under their interpretation?

interpretation.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Yes, under their

Yes.
So, what you could have is

you could have two parties sign an arbitration agreement

10

that lasts for a year that governs all disputes between

11

them, and one is from Vermont; the other from

12

California.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

So there is jurisdiction.

15

And all the disputes happen to involve just pure matters

16

of -- that never could come into Federal court.

17

there are such matters you could argue about.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Sure.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean

Right.

But nevertheless, we have a

20

Federal court issuing this injunction, under their

21

theory.

22
23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Assuming the amount

of -

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Assuming they are right.
Assuming the amount of

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

controversy -- I mean, it could have an amount -

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:

The arbitration

agreement has to meet the amount in controversy.

4
5

Oh, I see.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

It has to have an

independent basis for Federal jurisdiction.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So then

7

probably no arbitration agreement in itself meets the

8

amount.

MR. PHILLIPS:
point.

Well, that's exactly our

That's why you have to look through.
JUSTICE BREYER:

So if you didn't look

through, then this would apply to nothing?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Pretty much that's our view

of the case.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

If the arbitration Yes.

I'm sure my opponent

17

will say something different than that.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

The arbitration agreement

19

has to -- they talk about the arbitration agreement,

20

then you could have really important Federal questions

21

in substantive issues -

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that couldn't come in

24

because the arbitration agreement doesn't?

25

have State questions that would suddenly come in because
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Or you could

Official - Subject to Final Review

the arbitration agreement does.

2

now you're saying, well, that second case is never going

3

to arise.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

The arbitration -- but

Probably not.
Probably not, because no

6

arbitration agreement has -- so then it becomes a

7

nullity of the statute?

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

ouster.

Okay.

Right.
Except to overcome the

We've got your side of it.

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it makes a nullity of

13

it, except that it gets into the Federal court the

14

decision on the arbitration agreement, which was the

15

object of this stuff, whatever -- whatever the

16

underlying claim is, whether it's a Federal claim or

17

not.

18

As I understood the purpose of the

19

Arbitration Act, it was to make sure that arbitration

20

was -- was honored not just in Federal cases but in

21

State cases as well.

22

that, that sometimes a Federal court will -- will direct

23

arbitration in a case this involves an underlying

24

controversy that's purely non-Federal.

25

And it's entirely compatible with

MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh absolutely.
50

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

know, in a situation -- it depends on how you interpret

2

it.

3

does in saying that you can't have any look through -

4

now he softens that and says, well, no, you can have

5

look through for diversity.

If you interpret it the way that the Petitioner

6

But if you accept the idea that section 4

7

only makes you look at the dispute at the arbitration

8

level, then the reality is you're going to have no cases

9

that are going to be covered, because you're never going

10

to satisfy the amount in controversy.

11

And then the issue is why do you get to look

12

through for diversity purposes and never get to look

13

through for Federal question purposes?

14

seems to me the much easier way to reconcile the

15

language of the statute is to say, of course, you look

16

through to see, particularly if you have an unquestioned

17

Federal question dispute that's being litigated between

18

the parties; we know that; there is not an issue before

19

us.

20

today.

21

And it -- it

In fact, he has conceded as much even here in court

And so, it seems to me that's the solution

22

to this case.

Now admittedly, there will be other cases

23

where you may have right in these questions, and there

24

will be other cases where the parties will have to fight

25

at the Federal district court level as to precisely
51

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what's at issue and what the plaintiff really means to

2

be fighting over.

3

won't get an order that directs arbitration.

4

not this case.

5

And it may be in some instances you

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's

Why isn't it proper to

6

look to see -- the party who wants arbitration has a

7

dispute; the dispute is we are owed money by the debtor.

8

Why shouldn't the court say, well, we'll see what your

9

case is about; if your case would qualify for Federal

10

jurisdiction, fine.

11

what the defendants cases is or might be.

12

look at your case and that's how we will define the

13

controversy.

14

But we are not going to look to see

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there are two problems

15

with that.

16

subject matter of the controversy.

17

about the specific controversy.

18

We'll just

First of all, the statute talks about the
It doesn't talk

And second of all, the statute clearly

19

envisions that there are going to be situations where

20

there is no complaint, there is no underlying State

21

court cause of action, and it still envisions in that

22

situation that a district court is going to have to

23

determine whether or not it would have jurisdiction.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But then you'll have not

only a hypothetical claim, because nothing has been
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

brought, but an hypothetical answer by way of

2

counterclaim to that claim.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

But it seems to me that's

4

precisely what the language "would have jurisdiction

5

over the subject matter of the controversy" asks this

6

Court to make a determination of.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you would come into

8

the court and say there is no suit going on anywhere,

9

but if we were to bring this suit in State court, the

10

defendant could have brought this Federal counterclaim?

11

That's a lot of hypothesis.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

But it seems to me, Justice

13

Ginsburg, the better way to think about this is what if

14

we were getting letters from the Petitioner saying you

15

are engaged in usurious conduct, you're outrageous, you

16

got to stop what you're doing, we are going to bring a

17

class action against you, you had better change your

18

behavior tomorrow, and they don't sue us, and they don't

19

sue us, and they don't sue us?

20

And then the question is are we entitled to

21

go to court to get that resolved and are we entitled to

22

have the resolution to that issue as a matter of

23

arbitration?

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Phillips, the answer

to a better hypothetical is what if there had been no
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

original collection action but they had brought such an

2

action.

3
4
5
6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

actually, you're right.
JUSTICE STEVENS:
really saying.

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10
11

That's the case you're

You're saying that is like this case.

7

9

Well, that's -

That is this case.
And Justice Ginsburg is

suggesting it's not, because it happens to arise out of
a different -- quite different dispute.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

I thought your

12

question absolutely nailed it because you said, would

13

this -- you know, if you brought that suit could you and

14

would you, and the answer is yes, you could, and

15

therefore you know as -- without any question that it's

16

a Federal suit.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Excuse me As I understand your

19

opponent, they would agree there was no jurisdiction

20

even in that case.

21
22
23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

I think that's no

doubt that that's their position.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do with the

24

assertion that sections 9 through 11 are not in sync

25

with your view, because they would not give you -- you
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could go in and -- to compel arbitration but once the

2

arbitration was award -- an award was made, you would

3

not have access to the Federal courts to enforce the

4

award?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean the interesting

6

thing about 9, 10 and 11 is if anything the language is

7

broader than our language.

8

for" and "would have jurisdiction under," this would

9

clearly be an action that arises under Federal law,

If we didn't have the "save

10

because the question, you know, section 4 says have you

11

been aggrieved, do you have a right of action, and do

12

you have a remedy for that action?

13

I mean, without this rigamarole that we've

14

been talking about this whole time, we would have -- we

15

would easily have a 1331 action.

16

would argue that 9, 10 and 11 arise under Federal law

17

regardless.

18

it seems to me you just say you read sections 9, 10 and

19

11 and pairing material with the limitation in Section 4

20

and you wouldn't read it any broader than that.

21

So if anything you

Now if you don't want to go that far, then

But there is no basis for taking the

22

unlimited languages in 9, 10 and 11 and somehow

23

distorting that to more narrowly limit the rights that

24

we have under Section 4.

Yes.

What --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Section 4 creates the

Federal -

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, it does create it,

9

because section 4, without the "would have jurisdiction"

10

language clearly would be arising under jurisdiction, in

11

my judgment, and the only thing -- and then it places an

12

additional requirement on you.

13

You can't just use the contract that gets

14

you into Federal court.

15

whether you would have had an underlying cause of action

16

or an underlying Federal claim or whether there would

17

have been diversity jurisdiction on the underlying

18

claim.

19

You have to then look to see

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why can't you have

20

sort of modified look, through like a modified limited

21

hangout or whatever it was?

22

look through for the purpose of determining whether the

23

arbitration agreement raises a Federal question.

24

that doesn't mean you have to look through to determine

25

whether the underlying controversy raises a Federal

That is to say, you can

question.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Because I think -- I think

3

the reference in the statute to controversy clearly

4

envisions the underlying dispute between the parties,

5

because it's not just the arbitration agreement and it's

6

not even just the controversy; it's the subject matter

7

of the controversy, and you compare that to section 2

8

and it's clear that what the Congress has in mind there

9

is the underlying dispute between the parties.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is the Petitioner's -- I'm

11

sorry I didn't get a chance to ask the Petitioner -- is

12

the Petitioner's argument for a limited look through

13

compromised in any way by the Beneficial Bank case which

14

allows removal if there is a Federal defense?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, I don't know if

16

it's compromised by it.

17

case makes it absolutely clear that we have here a

18

Federal claim and therefore -

I think it -- the Beneficial

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's of course in the

context of a defense, as opposed to a counterclaim.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But again I don't

22

think -- I don't think section 4 is asking the courts to

23

make that determination.

24

asking the Court to look at is the subject matter of the

25

controversy, and is it -- is it clear under the

I think what section 4 is

MR. ORTIZ:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Just a

few quick points.

11

I think this Court should be exactly clear

12

how much Federal question jurisdiction the look-through

13

theory would create.

14

imagined anywhere in the lawsuit, there would be Federal

15

question jurisdiction under this theory, and this is

16

almost by definition going to be the case in any dispute

17

concerning credit card debt, either because of the

18

theory of complete pre-emption from the FDIA, or because

19

of the theory used in the Strong case before the

20

Eleventh Circuit that RICO's prohibition on the

21

collection of unlawful debt -

MR. ORTIZ:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There is a definition of

the controversy in your counterclaim and in their

5

response.

6

MR. ORTIZ:

No -- there -- in general, if

7

you accepted their theory, as long as there is an issue

8

that could be spun as a Federal issue which there will

9

always be in a credit card debt collection case and

10

just -- in most States, that on look-through theory

11

would be -

12
13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You're suggesting that

every credit card debtor would have a class action?

MR. ORTIZ:

Your Honor, every -- it does not

MR. ORTIZ:

the courts will decide these things to make the
