ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

10
11

MR. SIX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Article III makes a clear distinction

12

between the Court's appellate and original jurisdiction,

13

and expressly grants Congress power to make exceptions

14

and regulations for appellate jurisdiction, but Congress

15

is not granted the same power over original

16

jurisdiction.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's an extremely

18

sensitive clause in Article III.

We can decide this

19

case without relying on the distinction you just

20

discussed, can't we?

21

MR. SIX:

Well, I think can you, and the

22

Court certainly can interpret the statute not to even

23

reach the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and

24

avoid that constitutional conflict.

25

stronger reading of the statute arrives at that very

And I think the

result.

2

The statute at issue, the cost provision, 28

3

U.S.C. section 1920, states:

5

following."

subparagraph 3 at issue here, Fees and Disbursements for

7

Printing and Witnesses.

"A judge or clerk of any

The statute has two terms in it that are
defined, "judge" and "court of the United States," and,

10

importantly, one term in 28 U.S.C. section 451 that is

defined but does not appear in the cost provision, and

12

that is "Justice of the United States."

13

"judge," which does not include the Justices of the

So you have a contradiction no
On the one hand, it says

On the other hand, it says "court of the

Alderson Reporting Company

United States," which does include the Supreme Court.

2

So why should we pick one -- one answer to the

3

contradiction rather than the other?

4

MR. SIX:

You don't have to pick.

And

5

you're correct, "the court of the United States" is

6

defined to include the Supreme Court.

7

reading of the statute gives meaning to all of the words

8

in the statute, and it says you can be a judge who

9

appears in the court of the United States.

But the strongest

And if you

10

think about it, there's a circle of judges that are

11

defined here and a circle of courts that are defined

12

here, and where the two overlap, where you are both a

13

judge and in the court of the United States, the statute

14

should apply.

We may not be judges, but we certainly have a

MR. SIX:

You do, and 28 U.S.C. section

21

1911, another provision in Title 28, specifically deals

22

with the Supreme Court Clerk.

23

the Supreme Court is treated differently than the lower

24

courts.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And throughout title 28,

Is 1911 a stand-alone

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

provision that would justify relief for you, or do we

2

have to also refer to the general cost statute?

3

MR. SIX:

I don't think the Court would

4

refer to the general cost statute in its original

5

jurisdiction cases at all or any authorization from

6

Congress.

7

28 U.S.C. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but let's assume

8

that we think Congress can control this, this issue,

9

this question.

Now, I'm asking if 911 isn't a

10

stand-alone section so that you can interpret it without

11

reference to 1920.

12

MR. SIX:

I mean, I would -- if your

13

assumption is Congress has the power to do it and has

14

done so through 1911, I read 1911 more as simply a grant

15

of the discretion the Court already has.

16

turning over to the Supreme Court the power to have the

17

clerk set costs.

If I think this case is

controlled by 1911, do I have to refer to 1920?
MR. SIX:

No.

I don't believe you have to

refer to 1920.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why can't you rest your

case just on 1911?
MR. SIX:

Because in the original

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Congress isn't given
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

power to make exceptions or regulations over original

2

jurisdiction.

3

original practice, they have never referred to a

4

congressional cost provision, and -

5

And in the 219 years of the Court's

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you saying that 1911

6

doesn't cover expert witness fees because it's not

7

included within the term "other necessary

8

disbursements"?

9
10

MR. SIX:

I believe the expert witness fees

in this case were vital to the resolution.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. SIX:

13
14
15

incidental disbursements.

That's not our position.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Other necessary

disbursements.
MR. SIX:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

Were they within 1911?

I don't believe they were other

16

18

They were -

Other necessary disbursements.
Incidental to the case.

You don't that think that covers expert witness fees?
MR. SIX:

If -- if this Court determines

20

that Congress has the power, and it's done so through -

21

since 1911 -- has the power and done it from 1911, I

22

certainly would accept that position as the result.

23

However, I would point out to the Court that I think the

24

expert witness costs and the work was vital to the

25

resolution of the case here.

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you're reading of the

2

statute is correct, then I take it we would have the

3

discretion to decide what would be appropriate expert

4

fees.

Is that correct?

5

MR. SIX:

Absolutely.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

If that's so, why shouldn't

7

we exercise that discretion by saying that the expert

8

fees that are available in case of the original

9

jurisdiction of this Court should be the same as the

10

expert fees that would be available in a district court?

11

Maybe they are too low in the district court, but why

12

should there be -- why should we as a discretionary

13

matter, if we have the discretion, provide for radically

14

different fees depending on the court in which the case

15

originates?

16

MR. SIX:

Clearly the Court has the power to

17

make that rule for original cases.

However, the

18

original jurisdiction was developed when the States

19

agreed to submit and ratify the Constitution, submit

20

their sovereign immunity to resolution in the original

21

jurisdiction to handle unique disputes between the

22

sovereign States.

23

Georgia in 1854, "The analogies and rules and

24

foundations of law that apply to private parties are not

25

necessarily a good fit for sovereign States.

And as the Court said in Florida v.

is that they are telling you that the Special Master's

hands were tied; that the Special Master couldn't even

10

exercise that discretion in a bright line rule that

11

would save $40 a day.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We are saying it's our

13

discretion and our discretion is guided by what Congress

14

has suggested so there is uniformity in the system and

15

so forth.

MR. SIX:

Clearly, the Court would have the

power to do that.

don't know the answer to that.

8

expert witnesses appearing under subsection 3 of 1920.

9

I certainly can't speak to whether it's

Certainly 1920 makes a

I think the important point to consider,

10

though, is in the original jurisdiction the Court in its

11

219 years of developing essentially an interstate common

12

law in these cases has never relied on the trilogy of

13

cost statutes that the court discussed in Crawford

14

Fitting, with is I essentially Colorado's position:

15

have to apply Rule 54D first to have the court even have

16

the discretion to award costs; then you get to 1920,

17

which the Court said is the arena of costs; and only

18

after that do you get down to 1821, which tells you

19

you're limited to $40 a day.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How do Special Master fees

21

work?

22

parties I think usually divide them.

23

how is their authority to order them -

would the Special -- what would be the authority of this

12

Court to make an order that the Special Master be paid X

13

dollars?

14

MR. SIX:

Court comes from the order appointing the Special Master

16

Regardless of original

jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction, would you say

8

that this Court simply has the inherent authority to, to

in effect to decree these sorts of claims.

10

MR. SIX:

Well, again there is a distinction

11

between appellate and original and, focusing on

12

original, I think the Court has entirely the authority.

13

The Judiciary Act of 1789, which gave the Court

14

exclusive jurisdiction over these disputes, didn't set

15

forth any procedures to govern the disputes.

General Six, under your

reading of the statute, 1934 particularly, would the

MR. SIX:

Yes.

In the original jurisdiction

and come up with a recommendation.

17

could have learned -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I take it the usual

19

practice is for the parties to settle this matter and

20

submit an agreed amount to the Special Master; is that

21

correct?

22

MR. SIX:

The way it's worked in this case

23

is the Special Master has provided guidance, like on the

fees in other original jurisdiction cases, has the Court

ever deviated from the $40 or when it was $30, $30?

3

MR. SIX:

In original cases the Court has

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But have they ever

7

approved a Special Master's recommendation of a rate for

9

MR. SIX:

I think the answer to that is yes

and I would direct the Court to New Jersey v.

However,

from a fair reading of the -- the water distribution

24

issues, I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to do

that without experts.

But I would point the Court to
16

Alderson Reporting Company

the boundary dispute cases where the Court has discussed

2

the costs of surveyors, mappers, geographers,

3

historians, and divided the cost in boundary disputes

4

equally between the States -- not each State to bear

5

their own cost, but divided them equally.

6

And the -- the experts that are involved in

7

resolving a boundary dispute, I think, are no different

than the hydrologists and engineers and the type of

9

experts that we used in this case.

still, why shouldn't we follow it?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm not sure that

answer is -- is at all adequate.

12

there, as Justice Breyer pointed out, that's so

13

different about this case?

14

Number one, what is

Let's say one landowner secretly and

15

intentionally is stealing another landowner's water, and

16

-- and he has no legal right to do that.

17

way the injured landowner can recover is to hire a very,

18

very expensive expert, a hydrologist.

19

he goes to court, he is really going to lose the benefit

20

of the damages.

21

way it is.

22

And the only

And by the time

Congress has said too bad.

That's the

Why isn't it that way with States,

23

especially, as Justice Breyer said, when States can

24

really afford the -- afford it better than the

25

landowner.

What's the difference?

MR. SIX:

The difference is the Court has

2

indicated for original cases:

3

of a serious magnitude that can affect whole populations

4

that the model case for even taking a case is where the

5

acts between the States would be a causus belli, a type

6

of thing that would lead to war.

7

These are such disputes

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I haven't seen -- I

8

mean the $40 limitation makes absolutely no sense, does

9

it?

I mean I never saw an expert who would agree to

10

spend the day appearing in court worth being called an

11

"expert" for $40.

12

I mean the fact that -- I guess I'm just

13

repeating Justice Scalia's question.

14

Congress has picked an arbitrary number with no basis in

15

reality doesn't mean that we should do the same.

16

MR. SIX:

I would agree.

The fact that

The special

17

master 's fees, for example, for one person -- and he

18

was an excellent special|master -- were almost a million

19

dollars.

20

had amounted to approximately $30,000.

21

different there, I think, demonstrates the very

22

unfairness -

23

The appearance fees for the 22 experts Kansas

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that

It's not unfair to have a

24

rule which says each party pays his own experts, win or

lose.

That's the rule, isn't it?

I don't think that's the rule in

At least the Court has

The Court has -

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you lose this case, if

5

we were to follow Congress, we would have adopted a rule

6

where, because the $40 is trivial, each party pays his

7

own experts.

9

Is that right or wrong?

MR. SIX:

I think that's correct, but we

And the Court found that Kansas proved

10

that Colorado violated a compact for over -- for over 50

11

years by clear and convincing evidence.

12

I'd like to make -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But one point

Well, can we do this then?

14

I think maybe in many cases that are technical in nature

15

it might be quite a good thing for the losing party to

16

pay the winning side's lawyers.

17

MR. SIX:

18

The Court would have that ability

to do that in original jurisdiction -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, should we do that,

20

too?

21

don't we have them, the losing side, pay the lawyers'

22

fees?

23

If we are going to have them pay the experts, why

That would be quite a revolution.
MR. SIX:

Because in the original

24

jurisdiction cases involving prevailing parties or

25

litigious cases, the Court has traditionally and
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

historically awarded the prevailing party costs.

2

Congress can make a congressional limitation on cost,

3

Congress could pass a statute that says:

4

take all original jurisdiction cases, or you can't use

5

special masters, or you can't use certain special

6

masters in cases involving Colorado and Kansas.

I think they could pass a rule

like they did, Rule 54 -- 53, which allows for special

masters, and they could through the Rules Enabling Act

pass a rule that says you can't use special masters.

with your assumption that just because Congress need not

it wants with them.

3

MR. SIX:

4

misheard your question.

The order appointing the

5

special master did not resolve the issue of fees.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

Right.

And the parties did not agree to

8

that ahead of time.

9

and decided at the end of the litigation.

It was an issue to be determined

Isn't it -- isn't it

customary for it to be divided 50/50?

Is that not so?

16

I mean, we

And I thought that they were divided 50/50.

MR. SIX:

Well, as the case progressed, the

17

special master submitted bills that were divided 50/50.

18

At the conclusion of the case the parties suggested

19

reasons and special circumstances that should allow the

1821 of Title 28 is unambiguous.

It provides that a

witness in attendance at any court of the United States

3

shall be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day in

4

addition to travel and accommodation allowances.

5

Section 451 of Title 28 defines "court of

intended the limits set forth in 1821 to apply in such

MR. SUTHERS:

It would not be the first time

that you've allowed Congress to legislate some aspects

of your original jurisdiction.

jurisdiction in these cases is that the States were

afraid of what Congress would do in its own courts, the

Justice Ginsburg, we -- we

5

looked at it very carefully -- and it's difficult to

6

research -- but we could not find an original

7

jurisdiction case where there was an award of witness

8

fees outside the -- this $40 per day limitation.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did you find any cases

10

where the special master had appointed his own witness

11

as distinguished from the parties?

12

MR. SUTHERS:

No.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We did not.

But -

But you -- but you

recognize that if a special master appointed a witness,

or the court, that that witness would be paid a

compensatory fee?

MR. SUTHERS:

Whatever the special master

determined was appropriate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct.
Now, in a -- in a case

20

like this one, where the nature of the work that the

21

expert did seemed to be very helpful to both sides,

22

isn't it odd that the special master chose the court

expert, that expert would be compensated fairly but if

you have one party calls an expert who renders great

service to the Court, to both sides, doesn't get

Isn't that an anomaly?

not believe that he had an option in the matter, if

Do you -- may I ask you a

statutory question just about the application of the

applies it's because I -- it is, in effect, a

13

determination of a particular item under section 1920:

14

Judge and clerk of any court of the United States may

15

tax its cost.

16

covered by 1920, one of the items that a judge or clerk

17

may tax, is fees of the clerk.

18

As -- as you have pointed out, if the $40

My question is this.

One of the items

Under section 1911, which relates entirely

19

to the Supreme Court, there is a provision that the

20

Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its

21

clerk.

22

Supreme Court of the United States.

23

That is totally redundant if 1920 covers the

Doesn't it follow, therefore, that section

24

1920 was -- despite its reference to any court of the

25

United States, doesn't it follow that that statute was
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not intended to apply to the Supreme Court; and doesn't

2

it follow from that that either the Supreme Court's

3

authority is to fix the fees if this is a fee to be

4

charged by the clerk or, in the alternative, that there

5

is no statute on it at all?

6

But the main point is unless 1911 is totally

7

redundant in -- in referring to fixing the fees to be

8

charged by its clerk, then 1920 must not cover the

9

Supreme Court.

10

MR. SUTHERS:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

(Laughter.)

13

MR. SUTHERS:

have done that.

redundancies in it, but it's much more expansive than is

JUSTICE SOUTER:

further.

covered by 1920.

2

MR. SUTHERS:

Justice Souter, I think if you

3

look at the history of it, 1911 was enacted at the

4

same -- there is a separate statute -- statute that

5

applies to the court of appeals and to the district

6

courts.

7

I don't think that you can -

8
9

I think it's like 1913 and 1914.

In other words, if it's

redundancy it proves too much is what you're saying?

10

MR. SUTHERS:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR. SUTHERS:

Okay.

I think the important thing

13

about 1911, in response to Justice Kennedy's question,

14

it is limited to fees charged by the Supreme Court

15

clerk, cost of serving process and incidental

16

disbursements.

17
18

It does not address witness fees in -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
printing fees?

19

MR. SUTHERS:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

Do you think it includes

1911 does not, unless You don't -- you don't

think that -

22

MR. SUTHERS:

Incidental disbursements?

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- what number here?

You

24

don't think that 1911 would allow the clerk to charge

25

for printing fees?
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

MR. SUTHERS:
it may.

3

As an incidental disbursement,

But it clearly does not address witness fees.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the reason I ask is

4

because printing, in 1920, printing and witness fees are

5

in -- in the same sentence.

6
7

MR. SUTHERS:

printing would be considered incidental disbursements.

8
9

And I -- I don't know whether

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So if you allowed

printing, then I think it would allow witnesses under

10

1911. Citing Crawford Fitting, this Court made clear

11

that no statute will be construed to authorize taxing

12

witness fees and costs, unless it refers explicitly to

13

witness fees.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is -- I mean, if you

15

want to really get a little complicated, the -- you

16

have -- you have 11, and 11 talked about the Supreme

17

Court fees and then we have 20 and that talks about all

18

the other fees, right?

19

can't pay money in the United States unless have you

20

some authorization, but 1911 gives the Supreme Court

21

some authorization to fix fees.

22

Okay.

So the thing is, you

Now we look back at 1821.

And 1821 tells

23

you how much mileage per diem and subsistence will be.

24

It says he will be paid an attendance fee of $40 per

25

day.

Doesn't say you couldn't pay him more.

If I may, once again going to

the issue of why I think some uniformity is important in

cases are not exclusive jurisdiction; and there is in

fact a need for uniformity here; and the fact that this

think is very significant.

and Congress came along and said gee, no; it shouldn't

that Kansas cited Ford v Georgia, because that case says

Congress has undoubtedly the right to prescribe the

parties are going to be reluctant to -- to hire the kind

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

4

MR. SIX:

1920 didn't appear in 1948

5

magically.

It came from the 1853 Fee Act.

6

language in the Fee Act was, "A judge shall tax costs."

7

"A judge" -- it says, "Costs shall be taxed by a judge

8

or clerk of the court."

9

judge or clerk of any court of the United States."

I'm sorry.

14

judge" who can tax costs -- and we have a definition

15

that Congress tells us it means exactly the same thing.

16

It says that

And "judge" in 1853 meant a lower court

In 1920, we have exactly the same word -- "a

Under Colorado's reading "court of the

17

United States" would expand to read "judge" right out of

18

the statute, and it would make the statute apply to

19

"magistrate judge," for example, which is not included

20

in the definition, but they're somebody who wears a robe

21

and presides over a court of the United States, and it

22

would apply to Justices, even though 451 in title 28

23

defines "Justices" as a separate group.

24

--

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that's not

But the Constitution uses

the word "judge."

2

3

A "judge of the United States" is a

MR. SIX:

And certainly Congress isn't tied

4

to the way the word is used in the Constitution, no more

5

than the paper I got on my way in here told me not to

6

refer to any of you as "judges."

7

The point, I think, is that the Fee Act was

8

carried forward to 1920, and the language is almost the

9

same.

The only thing they have added is a definition of

10

"court of the United States."

11

Congress is going to tread on the Court's original

12

jurisdiction, they ought to at least have some express

13

language that they intend to do that -- do so, where the

14

Court could at the very least adopt a clear statement

15

rule that would require Congress to say, "We are going

16

to do this now.

17

now after 168 years we are."

18

And if after 168 years,

We've never done it in our history, but

Not only that, Colorado's position relies on
