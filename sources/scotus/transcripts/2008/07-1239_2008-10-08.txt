ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

We will hear argument

GENERAL GARRE:

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

The ability to locate and track an enemy

11

submarine through the use of mid-frequency active sonar

12

is vitally important to the survival of our naval strike

13

groups deployed around the world and therefore critical

14

to the nation's own security.

15

Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction that places

16

serious restrictions on the Navy's use of MFA sonar in

17

training exercises that in the judgment of the President

18

and his top naval officers are in the paramount

19

interests of the United States.

20

fundamentally flawed for three principal reasons.

21

In this case the Ninth

That injunction is

First, it is based on an erroneous

22

assessment of the likelihood of success on Respondent's

23

NEPA claim.

24

conception of the showing of irreparable injury

25

necessary to secure what this Court has aptly called

Second it is based on an erroneous

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"the extraordinary and dramatic remedy" of a preliminary

2

injunction.

3

vital public interests in conducting the training

4

exercises at issue unencumbered by the injunction's

5

restrictions.

6

And finally, it fails to take account the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Garre, when you

7

address the injunction, do you mean the injunction as

8

originally ordered by the district court or are you

9

taking account of the modification made by the Ninth

10

Circuit, and would you say that the three points you

11

just made would apply as well to the injunction as

12

modified?

13

GENERAL GARRE:

Certainly we would,

14

Justice Ginsburg.

15

claim is the same with respect to any aspect of the

16

injunction.

17

which we think Respondents haven't shown.

18

Circuit did modify the injunction by issuing a partial

19

stay.

20

modifications were tied only to a stay.

21

actually modify the injunction.

22

thought those modifications were appropriate, it would

23

have to vacate the Ninth Circuit decision.

24
25

Obviously our position on the NEPA

Say it again?

I 4

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

GENERAL GARRE:

The Ninth Circuit framed its

2

modifications in terms of a partial stay of its decision

3

affirming the district court's preliminary injunction.

4

That stay and therefore those modifications remained in

5

effect only until this Court issued its decision in this

6

case.

7
8
9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's the temporary

stay pending certiorari, right?
GENERAL GARRE:

Right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think what

11

Justice Ginsburg was talking about -- and she can

12

correct me if I am wrong -- were the modifications from

13

the initial preliminary injunction and the modified

14

preliminary injunction.

15

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, yes, we are here

16

complaining about the restriction on the 2200-yard

17

shutdown requirement, where if a marine mammal comes

18

within 2200 yards of a naval vessel part of one of these

19

strike groups it has to shut down sonar operations, as

20

well as the 75 percent powerdown requirement when

21

significant surface ducting conditions are present

22

regardless of the presence of marine mammals.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

You mentioned the effect on

24

naval operations.

On the other side, could you say what

25

the record shows about the number of marine mammals that
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are likely to be killed or receive actual physical

2

injury if the -- as opposed to some sort of behavioral

3

modification, if the injunction is allowed to continue?

4

GENERAL GARRE:

The record -- and here I'm

5

referring to the environmental assessment and the

6

opinion of the National Marine Fisheries Services in the

7

petition appendix and the joint appendix -- indicates

8

that no marine mammal will be killed as a result of

9

these exercises.

The environmental assessment predicted

10

there would be eight instances of injurious harm.

11

eight instances would take place only with respect to a

12

common species of dolphins of which there are hundreds

13

of thousands in the Southern California Operating Area.

14

These

Now, the environmental assessment also

15

predicted that there would be a much greater number,

16

170,000 over the course of two years, of so-called Level

17

B takes.

18

non-injurious disturbances and that's made clear at

19

pages 258a of the petition appendix and page 175 of the

20

JA, which make clear that these Level B disturbances,

21

the vast majority of the disturbances predicted by the

22

environmental assessment, are temporary and

23

non-injurious.

These are temporary and by definition

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

GENERAL GARRE:

Just as to dolphins?
The vast majority of those

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disturbances, some almost 90 percent, pertain only to

2

dolphins.

3
4
5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what percentage is

that of the total population in the area?
GENERAL GARRE:

Well, I think that the

6

statistics I have indicate that there are more than I

7

think 500,000 dolphins on the western coast there.

8

to -- the number may be actually a little bit lower in

9

the Southern California Operating Area.

10
11

As

But this is -

no one suggests that is in any way a threatened species.
With respect to the species that are

12

endangered, threatened, or even strategic under the

13

Marine Mammal Protection Act, the National Marine

14

Fisheries Services concluded there would be no adverse

15

harm on the population level or with respect to annual

16

recruitment rates with respect to those endangered or

17

threatened species in the biological opinion that the

18

district court sustained and that Respondents are not

19

challenging on appeal.

20

The focus of their claim of irreparable

21

injury -- and keep in mind that that environmental

22

assessment comes against the backdrop of a 40-year

23

history of the Navy's use of MFA sonar in the Southern

24

California Operating Area at the same frequency and, if

25

anything, during more frequent training exercises than
7
Alderson Reporting Company

have been conducted in recent years.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You didn't mention the

3

564 exposures that were typed Level A in the

4

environmental assessment.

5

GENERAL GARRE:

With respect to beaked

6

whales, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.

Those

7

disturbances are temporary, non-injurious disturbances.

8

That's important.

9

record on that because it's an important point.

Let me give you the page cites to the
JA 178

10

to 180, JA 185 to 188, and JA 198 to 200 discuss each

11

species of the beaked whales and explain that the harms

12

that are predicted in the environmental assessment are

13

non-injurious, temporary harms.

14

Now as a policy matter -

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

In lay terms, what does that

16

mean?

17

pattern, their migration pattern?

18

Does it mean an alteration of their swimming

GENERAL GARRE:

What does it mean?

In most cases it means that

19

there's an alerting response, they hear the sound and

20

they go in the opposite direction, as one who hears a

21

noise that disturbs them would ordinarily do.

22

also mean that they could have some temporary effect on

23

their feeding or breeding patterns, but it's a temporary

24

effect.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

It can

It doesn't necessarily mean
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that there's a physical injury to them, does it?

2

GENERAL GARRE:

No.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

It means that they may just

4

swim in a different direction.

5

GENERAL GARRE:

That's right.

By definition

6

only a Level A take involves an injurious harm, that is

7

a physical harm which results in permanent damage to

8

tissue.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the 564 number

10

was Level A, which I also thought meant exposure

11

resulting in severe harm.

12

GENERAL GARRE:

It is confusing,

13

Justice Ginsburg.

14

for purposes of the environmental assessment the Level B

15

takes with respect to beaked whales as Level A takes

16

because the Navy acknowledged that there is uncertainty

17

about the effects of sonar on beaked whales.

18

you look at what the environmental assessment says as to

19

the actual injuries that the National Marine Fish and

20

Wildlife Service and the Navy predicted based on the

21

best science available to them and to us today, they are

22

non-injurious, temporary exposures, and that is made

23

clear at the portions of the JA that I mentioned.

24
25

The Navy as a policy matter described

But when

Now, the Navy -- there is nothing that
prevents an agency from characterizing the particular

2

purposes of an environmental assessment.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question,

4

Mr. Solicitor General.

5

there is a duty to prepare an environmental impact

6

statement?

7

Is it understood, though, that

GENERAL GARRE:

Yes, there is, because we're

8

not here arguing that, at this point, that we had no

9

duty to prepare an environmental impact statement

10

because of the intervening event of the Council for

11

Environmental Quality's emergency circumstances

14

Respondent's claim.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's the

Let me follow that.

16

You concede that you have to prepare an EIS in light of

17

the CEQ's emergency circumstances?

18

GENERAL GARRE:

Yes, it's one of the

19

alternative arrangements that the Navy agreed to, is

20

that the environmental impact statement which has been

21

under way will be completed by January 2009 with respect

22

to all activities in the Southern California Operating

23

Area.

24

environmental impact statement was not required -- was

25

required at the outset.

Now, that's not to say that we concede that an

The Navy doesn't concede that.

It litigated this case up to the point of the Council

2

for Environmental Quality's determination.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why didn't you -- I

4

mean, you emphasize the level of detail and

5

comprehensiveness of the environmental assessment that

6

the Navy prepared.

7

didn't you just go ahead and do an EIS from the outset

8

if you were going to engage in such effort with respect

9

to the environmental assessment?

10

Why didn't you just make -- why

GENERAL GARRE:

Because the Navy devoted its

11

best resources to this and in good faith, as is indicate

12

bide the 293-page environmental assessment, concluded

13

that there would not be a finding of significant

14

environmental impact, and at that point everyone agrees

15

an environmental impact statement is not required.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you have to do it.

17

Given all your work so far, how long would it take?

18

had several months already, so how long?

it had an injunction against its use of sonar in these

training exercises and only an environmental impact

5

Quality found, emergency circumstances in terms of the

need to conduct these training exercises.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I take it that you're are

here because you find the decision of the Ninth Circuit,

and I take it of the district court, prejudicial for the

question I am asking.

I am not asking about the

13

Quality to dispense with the statutory obligation to

14

prepare it?

15

GENERAL GARRE:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I am asking what is the

Well That's what -- as I

17

understand it, that's what you're arguing in effect, as

18

an intervening -- as of intervening legal significance.

19

And I want to know what the statutory authority is for

20

that.

21

I don't see it in NEPA.
GENERAL GARRE:

The statutory authority that

22

we find in NEPA for the CEQ's regulation providing for

23

alternative arrangements is -- first, it's acknowledged

24

by this Court that CEQ has rulemaking authority.

25

Court acknowledged that in Department of Transportation

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

So we take that as a given.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

As a general

3

proposition that's fine, but what's the statutory

4

authority for them to engage in rulemaking authority

5

that dispenses with the government's obligation to

6

comply with an EIS requirement?

7

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, let me -- I'll answer

8

the question, but let me be clear:

The government's

9

position is that we are complying with NEPA by -- by

10

complying with the alternative arrangements provided by

11

the Council on Environmental Quality.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you -- I mean, the

13

claim is that you weren't complying with it at the time

14

the request for an injunction was brought, and

15

everything else is consequent on that.

16

back to the point, in effect, at which the claim was

17

made that the government is not complying.

18

answers to that is right now, as a result of subsequent

19

Council on Environmental Quality action, we're not in

20

the same situation that we were in when the suit was

21

brought.

22

authority is for the Council on Environmental Quality to

23

take the action with the effect that you claim it has.

24
25

So I want to go

One of your

And I want to know what the statutory

Honor, to the language in NEPA that says it should be

6

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, that language, coupled

circumstances, coupled with the fact that NEPA doesn't

noncompliance would be -

They're more or less an

Well, this Court has

22

acknowledged in numerous cases, Methow Valley and in the

25

substantial deference to the CEQ's rules.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Rulemaking to do what?

2

To set up an orderly regime for Federal agencies to

3

carry out their obligations under NEPA?

4

GENERAL GARRE:

To implement the statute,

5

that's right.

And there are a number of important

6

procedural requirements that go far beyond what the

7

statute requires that the CEQ has laid out in its

8

regulations.

9

been on the books since 1979 and has been implemented

One of the regulations -- and this has

10

some 40 times.

So this isn't something that was made up

11

in this case.

12

under NEPA that where there are emergency circumstances

13

an agency can come up with alternative arrangements to

14

comply with its NEPA obligations.

15

alternative arrangements were:

16

that is under way for all sonar activities and all other

17

activities by the Navy in the Southern California

statement, which was supposed to come first, is going to

5

come after the whole project is concluded?

6

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, it has -- it's

7

important because the environmental impact statement

8

that's going to be completed pertains not only to

9

COMPTUEX and JTF exercises that will be completed in the

10

11

all activities.

is going to be very meaningful.

So that environmental impact statement

Let me -- let me switch

Chief?
Let me switch back in time for a second to

the beginning of these exercises.

One of the -- I mean,

17

one of the arguments, and you have alluded to it, for I

18

guess the appropriateness of the Council on

19

Environmental Quality's action, if it has any power to

20

act, is emergency circumstances.

21

correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, is that the

22

exercises began in February of 2007.

23

is that it was in that same month of February 2007 that

24

the Navy produced the EA, the environmental assessment,

25

so that in effect, as I understand it, the Navy

My understanding, and

17
Alderson Reporting Company

My understanding

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disclosed the fact that it would not provide an EIS at

2

just about the same moment that it began the exercises.

3

GENERAL GARRE:

I think -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I guess my question is,

5

to the extent that there was an emergency, wasn't the

6

emergency created by the failure of the Navy to take any

7

timely action?

8

Navy had decided before February 1st, 2007, that it was

9

going to have these exercises.

I am assuming in my question that the

So it sounds to me as

10

though that, if there is an emergency, it's one that the

11

Navy created simply by failing to start an EIS

12

preparation in a timely way at which it tried in effect

13

to sort of neutralize by keeping everybody in the dark

14

until the last moment.

15

that -- even assuming the Council on Environmental

16

Quality can somehow dispense with the statute, why

17

shouldn't we say that there was no emergency here except

18

one which was created by the Navy's apparently

19

deliberate inattention?

20

So, why -- why shouldn't we say

GENERAL GARRE:

For several reasons,

21

Justice Souter.

22

Navy issued its environmental assessment and when the

23

first training exercises began.

24
25

First, there was a gap between when the

that's right, but there was a gap and there's no -- I

don't think there can be any -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And how long does it -- how

5

long does it take -- going back to Justice Breyer's

6

question, how long does it take to prepare an

7

environmental impact statement?

8

GENERAL GARRE:

This Court presumes the regularity of

particularly on this record, to have assumed that that

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Look, the problem you face

20

-- and maybe you're being whipsawed -- is that you are

21

effectively estopped from the argument that no EIS is

22

necessary by the fact that you have agreed to these

23

alternative arrangements.

24

estopped from arguing that at the time the EA was issued

4

assumption is valid.

It assumes that the EA wasn't

And I'm not sure that we -- that that

5

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, that's right.

And as

6

I indicated earlier -- I want to be clear -- the Navy

7

believes that its environmental assessment was not only

8

prepared in good faith, but was appropriate and reached

9

the right conclusions.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's exactly what

11

Justice Kennedy started to ask.

12

doesn't this thing go away after two months.

13

you've done it anyway, and Justice Kennedy said because

14

you want a holding from the Court that will help you in

15

other cases because you think what the court below did

here was wrong.

got out the first one, and I would like to hear the

18

other two.

And you said "three reasons," and you

GENERAL GARRE:

The other two are:

One, the

20

injunction.

Even if you agree with Respondents on the

21

likelihood of success of the NEPA claim, it's based on a

22

showing of irreparable injury that is fundamentally

23

flawed.

24

to whether there was irreparable injury under a

25

possibility standard.

The Ninth Circuit and the district court looked

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Didn't both the circuit and

2

the district court, although they mentioned that, in

3

fact find that it was -- I forget what their phrase was

4

--

beyond question.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

GENERAL GARRE:

8

Near -- "near certainty."
"Near certainty."

They did, Justice Souter,

and we think -

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There is no -- there is no

10

harm.

I mean, the standard may or may not be bright,

11

but there is no harm to the Navy in this case from -

12

from the use of that standard, I take it.

13

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, I don't think that a

14

court could say that, Justice Souter, for a couple of

15

reasons.

16

First, when a lower court applies a

17

fundamentally wrong standard to assess -- to make a

18

determination, this Court usually corrects that legal

19

standard and gives the -- the lower court an opportunity

20

to do it again.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, we -- we may, but so

22

far as the case is concerned we may -- and we frequently

23

do -- say there -- there -- that certainly there's no

24

harm in this case, the error was harmless.

25

GENERAL GARRE:

And, two, the finding, which
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is a sentence in the district court decision repeated by

2

the court of appeals, of "near certainty of harm to

3

marine mammals" is utterly belied by the environmental

4

assessment in this case as well as the fact that -- and

5

the Ninth Circuit acknowledged this -- the Navy has been

6

using MFA sonar in the Southern California Operating

7

Area for more than 40 years and no one can point to any

8

harm to marine mammals.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let me ask you -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Garre, could I ask you

11

a question?

12

GENERAL GARRE:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If this were not a Navy

14

case with all of the implications of the Navy, but an

15

ordinary case in which it was demonstrated that an EIS

16

had to be filed, would it not be normal -- normal action

17

to enjoin the -- the government action until the EIS was

18

filed?

19

EIS is -- is because you don't know what environmental

20

consequences may ensue.

21

So isn't it the normal practice to enjoin government

22

action until the EIS is filed when it is clear there is

23

a duty to file?

24
25

Because the -- the very fact that you need an

That's the purpose of the EIS.

GENERAL GARRE:
Justice Stevens.

I don't think it is,

I think it is -- the normal practice
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is to require someone who seeks the extraordinary remedy

2

of a preliminary injunction to show irreparable injury,

3

a likelihood of irreparable injury.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

6

Justice Stevens's question.

8
9

Would the irreparable

It is the same concern I

Let's assume an EIS is required; let's
assume it hasn't been prepared; let's assume the

10

government project is going to proceed.

11

to show irreparable harm before you can get the

12

injunction?

13

GENERAL GARRE:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

You do.
Do you have authority for

that in the -- are the circuits unanimous on that point?

16
17

You still have

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, I don't have authority

for that precise proposition because I don't -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

may not be in the circuits.

20

procedural injury alone is not the kind of injury that

21

confers standing; that there has to be some concrete

22

harm.

23

GENERAL GARRE:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Well, yes, you do, but it
Our cases say that

Well And -- and the only injury

that -- that follows from the mere failure to file an
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

EIS is -- is a procedural injury that affects the entire

2

population.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then, let's -- let's

4

assume standing.

5

assume people have standing.

6
7

GENERAL GARRE:

Let's -- let's

I -- I think that that's

right, Judge Scalia.

8
9

Let's assume standing.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I wouldn't -- look,

you have an EIS for the reason that the agency itself,

10

once it reads it, might decide to do something else.

11

That's the whole point of an EIS.

12

ahead with the action before reading the EIS, it becomes

13

committed to that course of action, and the chances that

14

the EIS will lead it to back up are the same as the

15

chances that any big agency will back up once it's

16

committed to a course, namely a lot lower.

17

always thought was the whole harm that the EIS is there

18

to stop.

19

GENERAL GARRE:

So if the agency goes

And that I

Clearly, the purpose of the

20

requirements under NEPA are to ensure that the agency

21

has -- is making an informed decision, and here I don't

22

think there is any question that the Navy was after its

23

293-page assessment.

24

I am not aware of any -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that -- in effect, you

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are saying the EA is the equivalent to an EIS.

2
3

GENERAL GARRE:

No, I'm not, Justice Souter.

I am saying -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What is the difference

5

between them?

I -- I assume the difference is the EIS

6

is a more comprehensive survey and -- and set of

7

conclusions.

8

GENERAL GARRE:

That's right, but then -

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that without the EIS,

10

the Navy is acting in -- in a state of -- of some degree

11

of ignorance greater than would be the case if -- if it

12

had done -- done the EIS.

13

GENERAL GARRE:

I -- the EIS -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that, I presume, is the

15

harm that the -- that the statute is intended to

16

prevent.

17
18
19

GENERAL GARRE:

But it is not a likely -

they have not shown a likelihood of irreparable injury.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

The EA demonstrates in your

20

view that the EIS would -- would very likely say that

21

this -- this action by the Navy is okay.

22

is the case, there is -- there is no probability of

23

irreparable harm; to the contrary, there is the

24

probability of no irreparable harm because of the EA.

25

GENERAL GARRE:

And since that

Well, we agree with that.
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

We think it's important, though, to separate out the

2

likelihood of success on the NEPA claim with the

3

distinct question of whether there is irreparable injury

4

and look to the record of whether there is irreparable

5

injury.

6

establishing that.

And we think they have not come close to

7

The one final -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there any authorities

8

in the circuits which would indicate that irreparable

9

injury is not required when there's standing, when an

10

EIS is required, when an EIS has not been prepared, and

11

when the government is ready to proceed?

12

always irreparable injury before you can get an

13

injunction?

14

There is

That's what all the circuits say?
GENERAL GARRE:

Justice Kennedy, I haven't

15

completed that -- that research with respect to all of

16

the circuits, but I am confident in saying I am not

17

aware of a decision in which a court has said that the

18

irreparable injury requirement does not have to be met

19

or is automatically met.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The whole theory of the -

21

of the environmental impact statement is that we don't

22

really know what the harm will be.

23

that in order to get an injunction against the

24

government action you have to prove irreparable harm?

25

GENERAL GARRE:

So how can you say

And it may be easier in some
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases than others, Justice Stevens.

But I think in this

2

case where you have the record that has been compiled,

3

they cannot -- they cannot -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But you're really arguing

5

that an -- that a temporary statement is enough, will

6

always be enough.

7

GENERAL GARRE:

8

position, Justice Stevens.

9

that the record in this case does not show a likelihood

10
11

We're not taking that
We're taking the position

of irreparable injury.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

In all -- in all of these

12

cases it is controverted, or in most of them, whether an

13

EIS is either necessary -- is even necessary.

14

mere allegation that it was necessary gives rise to an

15

allegation of irreparable harm, you are going to get a

16

preliminary injunction in all cases?

17

GENERAL GARRE:

18

think that fundamentally -

19
20
21

So if the

I think that's right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

not suggesting JUSTICE STEVENS:

But there is a finding

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Kendall.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KENDALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The fundamental question in this case is a
very traditional question of equity jurisprudence.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fundamental question is whether the district court's

2

factual finding that the injunction will permit the Navy

3

to train and certify its sailors is supported by the

4

evidence.

5

cannot be clearly erroneous.

6

erroneous, it cannot be reversed.

7

Because if it is supported by the evidence it

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if it is not clearly

Isn't there something

8

incredibly odd about a single district judge making a

9

determination on that defense question that is contrary

10
11

to the determination that the Navy has made?
MR. KENDALL:

Justice Alito, I submit not,

12

and here is why.

13

question was whether, in light of the Navy's past

14

training, which was abundantly shown in the record,

15

their post-complaint, during the litigation, lawyer

16

crafted declarations were sufficiently persuasive to

17

undo all that evidence that showed that the Navy had

18

repeatedly used safety zones.

19

This was an issue of fact.

The

Now, what happened here was that the judge

20

was extraordinarily deferential to the Navy.

21

rejected most of the measures that plaintiffs sought,

22

crediting where the evidence was not to the contrary the

23

declarations of the Navy saying, for example, we need to

24

train at night.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

The judge

I didn't see evidence to

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the contrary on two important points.

The first was

2

that the Navy had affidavits which says -- they say -- I

3

read them.

Maybe I just missed the contrary.

4

said that:

You are requiring us, judge, to turn the

5

sonar down to six decibels or up to six, whatever,

6

whenever we had to run into a situation called layering

7

of different temperature levels.

8

naval officers, that that's just where submarines like

9

to hide.

But they

And we tell you, as

And we also tell you that if we can't train

10

people to do that they will miss out on an important

11

part of how to find these submarines.

12

I saw no answer to that.

13

The second thing they said was that:

We're

14

willing to turn off the sonar if there's any marine

15

mammal that comes within 500 yards, which is a quarter

16

of a mile, about.

17

sonar when any animal comes within a mile and a quarter.

18

And that's quite a big distance more.

19

come in there, and if we have to turn off the sonar all

20

those times, we are not going to be able to get much

21

training done.

22

But you insist that we turn off the

A lot of animals

Now, those two things seem to be quite

23

important.

And I just might have missed, which I might

24

have, which is why I'm asking, what the response was by

25

equivalent experts to those points.
31

trained and certified its troops during those eight

ducting conditions.

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you mean, despite

the complete absence?

MR. KENDALL:

Because surface ducting

conditions are, as it happens, quite rare.

JUSTICE BREYER:

train people to deal with it.

that when you didn't run into it they didn't train

The district court did reach

21

the question of whether the Navy could train.

negated any emergency under any definition of the term.

It doesn't matter whether -- and there was debate about

this below -- an emergency can be foreseeable and

But the

The reason there is no emergency is because

And this judge, keep in mind, had been

listening to the Navy make factual assertions from the

very beginning.

7

And there are a number of statements that General Garre

And the factual assertions that the

The Navy tries to dismiss those by

beaked whales have stranded repeatedly around the world

19

the evidence is overwhelming, by sonar.

that happens especially to beaked whales is because they

for very long periods of time, and they are then

bombarded with sonar, which by the way in sound

on in the water if you were a marine mammal near that

so long, if they come up too fast, they get the bends so

there is evidence of -- when they do the necropsies of

these beaked whales, they find hemorrhaging, the

embolisms in various parts of the bloodstream and many,

The beaked whales, the scientists believe,

So there is enormous scientific evidence

10

that there is a greater harm to beaked whales that is

caused by sonar and that is precisely why the Navy was

compelled in the EA to recognize that evidence.

6

We tried very hard to resolve this

So it was a binary -

They had already

taken actions unilaterally to protect marine mammals.

8

Now you say that wasn't.

9

MR. KENDALL:

Right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But they were taking

some actions.
MR. KENDALL:

That's right.

And -- and so

we had a litigation that was focused on were there

additional actions that should be taken; and there is

extensive evidence taken and extensive argument and then

16

the district court ruled.

17

Navy was aggrieved by that decision, was a higher court.

18

But instead, in order to avoid the clearly erroneous

standard -- and remember, that the clearly erroneous

standard as this Court said in the Anderson v. Bessemer

Justice Scalia I think raised a question is the EA as

good as the EIS?

11

are really two, between an EA and EIS.

12

difference is that an EA doesn't have the same

alternatives analysis that an EIS has, and the

procedural difference, which in a country that values

transparency and ideas and exchange with the public, is

16

the notice and comment that EIS requires.

There is a big, big difference.

faith on -- on the part of the Navy holds water so long

as they were doing an EA.

22

an EIS is necessary.

there is no significant harm to the environment, you

1

MR. KENDALL:

Well, I -- with respect I

2

think the district court spoke in several different

3

opinions.

4

district court was thinking by looking not only at the

5

injunction, but also at the -- at the responsible

6

district court denying the motion to vacate.

7

So you can -- you can find out what the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Suppose it's still

8

fair to say that on all of those it focused most of its

9

attention on likelihood of success on the merits and

10

irreparable harm rather than a balancing of the

11

equities.

12

MR. KENDALL:

Well I would disagree in one

13

respect, which is the court was very focused on which

14

measures to impose and which measures not to impose.

15

There were, you know, at least 10 pages of her

16

injunctive opinion going through that, and each -- and

17

the denial of the motion to vacate did the same thing,

18

because -- after the Ninth Circuit ordered Judge Cooper

19

to issue a tailored injunction, each side briefed very

20

extensively, with a huge amount of supporting evidence,

21

the issue of which measures should be imposed.

22

Judge Cooper decided that certain measures would not be

23

imposed and certain ones would, and she explained why.

24

And she did that against the background of the harms

25

that were designed to be prevented.
47
Alderson Reporting Company

And

And so what I would

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

submit is -

2
3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think that's -- I

think that's quite right.

4

My question, though, is that at no point

5

that did the district judge undertake a balancing of the

6

equities, putting on the one side the potential for harm

7

to marine mammals that she found -- and that's your

8

point about the record -- and putting on the other side

9

the potential that a North Korean diesel electric

10

submarine will get within range of Pearl Harbor

11

undetected.

12

And the district court never entered -- never went into

13

that analysis.

14

Now, I think that's a pretty clear balance.

MR. KENDALL:

There's a good reason why she

15

didn't balance that.

16

remarks, which is that the premise of that question and

17

why, Mr. Chief Justice, you would be concerned about

18

that is that there would be an exposure to that

19

submarine, that North Korean submarine.

20

had made a factual finding, and the factual finding she

21

made was that training would not be affected.

22

the one hand, you have a factual finding that there is

23

no harm to the training at all, which means that in the

24

balance the harms to the environment are much heavier.

25

And that gets back to my opening

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the judge

Do you -- how much

MR. KENDALL:

And, you know, this Court has had in a

I submit that what happened here is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even the district -

17

even the district court recognized, in the words of her

18

opinion, that it would propose "a substantial challenge"

19

-- that's a quote -- for the Navy to shift the regime

20

that she imposed in the injunction.

21

MR. KENDALL:

That's right, and it will in

22

fact pose a challenge and the proof is then in the

23

pudding, which is that the Navy has now conducted 13 out

24

of 14 exercises, the last 8 of which had been conducted

25

under this regime as modified by the circuit.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

By the time this case got

5

back to the court -- the district court a second time,

6

the President had made a determination that this was in

7

the paramount interest of the United States.

8

Defense and Commerce Department jointly had made a

9

determination that this is necessary for the national

The

10

defense.

And it seems to me, even if those

11

determinations don't resolve the EIS statement, they

12

certainly must be given great weight by the district

13

court in determining whether to continue the injunction.

14

If you could comment on that, incorporate it also in

15

what you were going to say about Mr. Garre's argument

16

with reference to the standard.

17

MR. KENDALL:

Yes.

First, responding to

18

that very point, it's common ground among the litigants

19

and certainly with the court that the interests ascribed

20

by the President and by every other government official

21

with respect to Naval training are of the highest

22

importance.

24

sufficient record evidence to support it, whether she

was right that there wouldn't be an adverse effect

concerning the court.

6

If there's no adverse effect, then what the

Now, with respect to irreparable harm, the

7

argument that General Garre made I think mistakenly

8

collapses the normal equity issue in this following

9

sense:

Once a plaintiff satisfies Article III, very

10

important, and under the Japan Whaling case, the Lujan

11

v. National Wildlife case, there is no question that

12

these plaintiffs deserve to be in court, and it has

13

never been contested.

14

Then you move to the traditional equity

15

standard for assessing irreparable harm, Hecht v.

16

Bowles, but in the environmental area we have a

17

decision, the Amoco v. Gambell decision.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

That

19

irreparable harm is the assessment of -- for purposes of

20

the injunction -- refers to the same harm that is the

21

harm which is the basis for standing, is it not?

22

MR. KENDALL:

It always does, and the

23

question is somewhat different.

And I think,

24

Justice Scalia, if you look at your opinion in the

25

second Lujan case and you think about the imminence
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

requirement of standing there, what irreparable harm

2

adds to that is the traditional need to show that the

3

harm you suffer cannot be quantified in damages or it's

4

difficult to quantify, and that a remedy at law will not

5

achieve the adjustment between the parties that's

6

required.

7

the positions of the parties.

That's what equity does.

Equity preserves

8

And as this Court said in Amoco,

9

environmental injury, by it's very nature, can seldom be

10

adequately remedied by money damages and is often

11

permanent or at least of long-lasting duration, i.e.,

12

irreparable; that is Amoco at page 545.

13

is sufficiently likely, therefore, the Court said, the

14

balance of harms will usually favor the issuance of an

15

injunction.

16

If such injury

Now, there's one other point which was

17

briefly touched on here.

Justice Kennedy was asking

18

what the circuits have said.

19

said different things about irreparable harm.

20

leading edge of discussion in the circuits began with

21

then-Judge Breyer on the First Circuit in the

22

Massachusetts v. Watt and Sierra Club v. Marsh cases,

And finally I think I heard my colleague, my

10

friend, concede that you have to show Article III injury

11

in order to show irreparable injury.

12

to show irreparable injury to marine mammals, which they

13

haven't; they have to show irreparable injury to

14

themselves, and particularly as to beaked whales, which

15

none of the declarants and none of their members have

16

ever asserted they have seen.

17

establish any irreparable injury from any conceivable

18

harm to beaked whales, even though the record in this

19

case makes clear that all harms to the marine mammals

20

that we have been discussing today are temporary

21

non-injurious harms.

22

They not only have

They can't possibly

We would ask this Court to set aside the

23

decision of the Ninth Circuit, which seriously

24

interferes with critical training exercises that the

25

President, his chief Naval officers have determined to

be in the paramount interests of the United States.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can I -- before you sit

3

down.

I thought I recalled something in your briefing

4

dealing with the beaching -- your friend made a point

5

regarding the beaching of beaked whales, that very

6

substantially showed that they were caused by sonar.

7

You had something in your briefs about beaching, but I

8

wasn't sure whether it was beaked whales or only

9

dolphins.

10

GENERAL GARRE:

It pertains to beaked whales

11

as well.

Page 256 of the petition appendix is the

12

National Marine Fisheries Service's determination that

13

the conditions which led to strandings with respect to

14

beaked whales in other parts of the world are not likely

15

to lead to strandings in the Southern California

16

Operating Area.

17

in the national defense exemption mitigation measures at

18

page 258 of the petition appendix.

19

beachings of beaked whales in Southern California.

20

have been tied to sonar operations, and that further

21

underscores the absence any injury to any marine mammal

22

in Southern California despite 40 years of the Navy's

23

use of sonar operations in that area.

Those conditions are taken into account

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
