CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 07-1529, Montejo v.

5

Louisiana.

6

Mr. Verrilli.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether

12

Petitioner Montejo should be denied the Sixth Amendment

13

protections of Michigan v. Jackson because he silently

14

acquiesced in the appointment of counsel at his initial

15

hearing, rather than affirmatively accepting the

16

appointment.

17

an affirmative acceptance was required to trigger

18

Jackson and therefore upheld the admission of a

19

confession elicited during police-initiated

20

interrogation after Montejo's Sixth Amendment right had

21

attached and after a lawyer had been appointed to

22

represent him.

23

The Louisiana Supreme Court believed that

If Jackson applies, that confession should

24

not have been admitted, and Jackson should apply because

25

nothing in this Court's precedents or, frankly, in
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

common sense supports a rule that affords less Sixth

2

Amendment protection to defendants who are automatically

3

appointed counsel at initial hearings than to defendants

4

who are appointed counsel after a request for

5

counsel has -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought that the

7

rationale of Jackson was that the confession is simply

8

deemed to be coerced if the defendant has expressed -

9

has expressed -- his desire to have counsel present or

10

even to be represented by counsel.

11

which is already a stretch, to assume that simply

12

because I said, you know, I would like to have counsel,

13

if the police continue to say, well, come on, won't you

14

talk to us -- it's already a stretch to say it's

15

automatically coerced.

16

It isn't clear that,

But now you're saying, even if the defendant

17

has never expressed even a desire to be represented by

18

counsel but has simply had counsel appointed, in fact

19

even if he doesn't know about the appointment of

20

counsel, the -- his confession is automatically deemed

21

to be coerced.

22

extravagant than Jackson.

23

MR. VERRILLI:

That seems to me quite, even more

Well, I don't -- without

24

taking up at the moment the question whether Jackson was

25

extravagant, it does seem to me, Your Honor, that your
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question does get to the heart of the matter.

2

situation like Jackson, the defendant requested counsel

3

and that was deemed to be an election of the right to

4

rely on counsel, not merely at the initial hearing but

5

for all purposes.

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

MR. VERRILLI:

And the question here, it

seems to me, Your Honor, is what does one do when a

10

defendant is automatically appointed counsel?

11

two options:

12

elected the right to rely on counsel, and -

13
14

What has he

elected here?

8
9

Right.

In a

There are

One is to treat that defendant as having

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why?

Why would one do

that?

15

MR. VERRILLI:

And the other option is to

16

deem that the defendant has decided to go it alone.

17

Those are the two possibilities here, and it seems to me

18

that -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry to

20

interrupt, but isn't there a third, which is that you

21

just don't assume anything and you wait to see if he

22

makes -- says, "I want to talk to my lawyer," or he

23

could well say, "You've told me," as was the case here,

24

"I have a right to a lawyer, I don't have to say

25

anything, I want to talk some more, I don't -- okay,
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there's a lawyer, fine, I want to talk without my

2

lawyer, I want to waive my right to counsel."

3

can do.

4

MR. VERRILLI:

Which he

I think the problem, Mr.

5

Chief Justice, is that in the -- it is an either/or

6

choice because, if you -- if the defendant is deemed to

7

have elected to rely on counsel on the basis of the

8

appointment, then the police may not initiate

9

interrogation.

10

It's only if the defendant -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

If you

11

prevail and you say silence constitutes saying "I want

12

to talk to my lawyer," that's right.

13

a false, a false alternative.

14

MR. VERRILLI:

I'm saying that's

Well, I don't think so.

I

15

think if the police initiate interrogation after a

16

lawyer has been automatically appointed, then that

17

interrogation either has to be deemed to be in violation

18

of the rule of Jackson or not, and that seems to me to

19

depend on how you characterize what happens in the

20

course of an automatic appointment.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you -

Mr. Verrilli, the

22

defendant himself could say, "Police, I'd like to talk

23

to you."

24

initiation.

25

That would be okay.

MR. VERRILLI:

But this is police

That's absolutely the
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

critical point, Justice Ginsburg.

This is a limited

2

rule, and the free choice of the defendant to initiate a

3

conversation with the authorities is always present.

4

The question is, what do we do in an automatic

5

appointment situation?

6

question because -- and I would refer the Court to the

7

appendix, to the amicus brief of the National Legal Aid

8

and Defender Association, which I think is a helpful

9

reference here.

And this is a significant

It goes through each State, and what it

10

shows is that approximately half the States have

11

procedures in which, as a matter of course, the

12

defendant is asked at the hearing whether he or she

13

wants counsel, and if the defendant says yes, then we're

14

in a Jackson situation.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I just want to make sure I

16

understood your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question.

17

Assume a lawyer is appointed.

18

I want my lawyer."

19

policeman walks by, he says, "I have a lawyer, but I

20

want to talk to you now."

21

MR. VERRILLI:

22
23

The defendant says, "Yes,

He's in the jail cell.

Initiation is the key.

The

Can the police talk to him?
Yes, if he initiates.

Initiation -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

Well, then it

24

seems to me that the Miranda protections give you all -

25

or, the Miranda rules give you all the protection you

need.

2

MR. VERRILLI:

I don't think so, Justice

3

Kennedy.

A couple things.

4

that to reach that conclusion that the Court really

5

would have to overrule what is a key holding in Jackson,

6

and I don't think that that would be appropriate to do

7

in this case for a whole host of reasons.

8
9

First of all, it seems to me

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm wondering if

there is some further rule, could the prosecutor talk to

10

the defendant if the defendant was in the cell and the

11

prosecutor walked by, saying, "I know you have an

12

attorney, but I would like to talk to you"?

13

prosecutor do that consistently with the Sixth

14

Amendment?

15
16

MR. VERRILLI:
initiation.

Yes.

It depends on

It depends on who initiates.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. VERRILLI:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

Could the

Really?

The lawyer -

If the defendant The lawyer can talk to a

client for another lawyer?

21

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, if the -- if the

22

defendant initiates, then the defendant is -- then the

23

bar of Jackson doesn't apply.

24

--

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's the rule, but the

Well, again, if that's -

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if that's the principle that you're operating on and

2

that you'd concede, then I think the Miranda warnings

3

would suffice to give all the protection you need.

4

MR. VERRILLI:

I don't -- apart from the

5

question of whether you can reach that result without

6

overruling the core holding of Jackson here, it does

7

seem to me, with all due respect, we don't agree with

8

that because, on the one hand, we do think that free

9

choice is preserved in the existing regime and, on the

10

other, hand we don't think Miranda can give you all the

11

protection you need.

12

And I think a good illustration of that is

13

this Court's decision in the Moran case.

14

Moran, that was an interrogation that occurred before

15

the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights had attached, and

16

the -- and the police -- and the defendant had a lawyer

17

in that case.

18

The lawyer was trying to reach him.

19

away, kept the lawyer away from the defendant.

20

Court held that, in the Fifth Amendment context, because

21

the Sixth Amendment right had not attached, that the

22

Miranda warnings sufficed to guarantee the reliability

23

of the confession.

24
25

Now, recall in

and then reiterated this again in Patterson, that in the

because it's an interference with the relationship

3

between the defendant and his lawyer, and the ability of

4

the defendant to rely on the lawyer.

5

key.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's the

It is that, whether or not

7

the defendant initiates the contact.

I mean, in civil

8

matters, it's contrary to the ethics of the bar to

9

interrogate the party on the other side when you know he

10

has a lawyer, and that would be the case even if he

11

initiated it.

doing here.

19

All right?

MR. VERRILLI:

We're

That's what we're

Well, what the -- we're

20

applying -- the question here is whether defendants in

21

this category, the category that Mr. Montejo is in,

22

automatic appointment, are entitled to the same Sixth

23

Amendment protection as defendants who are in the

24

category of -- who are brought to trial in States where

25

they -- you have this colloquy as part of the initial
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hearing where the defendant is asked.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why couldn't we solve your

3

practical problem that we don't know in many States

4

whether the defendant accepted appointment or not, by

5

simply saying it is not enough to simply accept

6

appointment of counsel; you must have requested counsel.

7

To merely say, "Oh, that's great, you appointed me

8

counsel" -

9
10

MR. VERRILLI:

Well -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You must have requested it.

11

And that would be in accord with the holding of Michigan

12

v. Jackson and would solve all of your -- all of your

13

practical problems.

14

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, two things, Your Honor.

15

First, it seems to me that what the dispute here is is

16

whether there is a principled basis for treating these

17

two categories of defendants differently, the defendants

18

who are brought to hearings in States where the

19

procedures require that they be asked and defendants who

20

are brought to hearing in States where they are

21

automatically appointed counsel without a showing of

22

indigency -- upon a showing of indigency.

23

-- I think with respect to the question of practical

24

problems going forward, sure, if all States -- if the

25

States in that second category were to conform their
11
Alderson Reporting Company

And I don't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

practices such that the defendants were asked and had

2

the opportunity to say yes, indeed, I want counsel, then

3

I suppose the problem would be solved.

4

get to the same place by holding, as we submit the Court

5

really should hold, that when -- when you have an

6

automatic appointment, unless there is some reason to

7

think the defendant is rejecting it, that Jackson kicks

8

in and that -

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you really

What happens under Michigan

10

v. Jackson if I have never requested counsel?

11

never asked the court to appoint counsel, but I've gone

12

out and hired counsel of my own, right?

13

MR. VERRILLI:

Sure.

I've

I think it's quite

14

clear that the rule of Michigan against Jackson applies,

15

and that's because -

16
17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it clear from Michigan

v. Jackson itself, or MR. VERRILLI:

Well, from cases applying it,

19

because in that situation the person is deemed to assert

20

the right to counsel by hiring a lawyer, just as by

21

asking, and the question here is when you have an

22

automatic appointment why should you treat that category

23

of defendants any differently for purposes of applying

24

the Jackson rule?

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Verrilli, do I

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

understand correctly that the scenario here was the

2

defendant, uncounseled, was taken before a judicial

3

officer who read him rather standard information, one

4

piece of information was, I'm appointing a lawyer for

It doesn't reflect anything about a colloquy because in

11

the normal course there's not -- there's no occasion for

12

the colloquy.

decision about bail is made, and you move on, and the

14

next person comes in and that happens.

15

All we have is a one-page

I thought he was told that

The Office of Indigent

Counsel is appointed to represents you.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Right, and the actual

lawyer didn't show up until later.
MR. VERRILLI:

Right.

The way the process

23

works is -- it's not in the record, but the way the

24

process works in this judicial district is there is a

25

legal assistant there who takes the names of people who
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

need lawyers and then immediately -- and the public

2

defender service in this district is a contract service.

3

They're private attorneys who contract out to do it.

4

And then the legal assistant immediately calls, tells

5

the lawyers, well, here is who you are representing.

6

Now, in a case like this one, which is a

7

capital case, there was of course a great sense of

8

urgency.

There are only two lawyers in this district
They

10

got called immediately.

that this hearing took place in the morning and Mr.

12

Montejo gets taken back to the jail and very soon after

13

he arrives he gets checked back out by these officers

14

again and taken out in the squad car where he is kept

15

for six hours, and in the meantime essentially while

16

he's going out the back door, while he's being taken out

17

the back door with the police, his lawyer is coming in

18

the front door and raising holy heck about the fact that

19

his client's not -

If the police initiated the

7

interrogation, yes, because I think it gets to the heart

8

of the -

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a violation,

10

11

request one, he knows one's been appointed for him, and

12

he's been warned that if he doesn't want to talk without

13

a lawyer he doesn't have to, and he's in the middle of a

relying solely on Miranda -- that even in that

situation, even if it's true that the police officers

13

told him on September 10th that he did not have a

14

lawyer, that that wouldn't rise to the level of a

15

problem that would cause a Fifth Amendment issue under

Miranda because of the facts of Moran.

17

me that's exactly the problem there, that that means in

arraignments have to be done in the presence of counsel.

So it seems to me you would be destabilizing

Sixth Amendment operate in an equivalent manner.

The generous prophylactic rule of Michigan

Did he have an

Patterson says is sufficient in the context of a

included the right to counsel, and he then waived those

pre-attachment and three of which were post-attachment,

at all with the argument you are making if someone had

As I see the case, the question is

Jackson turned on the fact that that defendant had asked

so.

Patterson said

Patterson said Jackson turned on -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but in this very

18

case, if there had been a court reporter present -

present, and if the record showed that this defendant

20

said, thank you, I would like to be represented, then he

21

would have been protected, right?

MS. LANDRY:

No, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So what would -- what

3

should we presume to be the general practice that

4

happened, that most of them say, no, I don't want one or

5

most of them will say, thank you?

6

MS. LANDRY:

Well, probably in most cases

7

nothing is said.

But, again -- and that goes back to my

8

earlier point, the police then approached -- I mean, the

9

defendant could have said something at the hearing, but

10

presuming nothing was said -

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

He had no -- no way of

12

knowing that being silent would produce a different

13

result than saying, yes, I'm happy with the lawyer.

14

Does the uncounseled defendant have any way to know

15

that?

16

you have got a lawyer, but he's not going to be

17

available unless you say you want him?

18

Does the routine require the judge to tell him,

MS. LANDRY:

No, because I think

19

subsequently if he doesn't say anything when the police

20

approach him, they tell him he has the right to counsel,

21

and at that point he can exercise that right and say, I

22

want a lawyer, I don't want to talk to you without a

23

lawyer.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Landry, I don't really

understand what you're arguing here.

I thought you were

saying there has to be a request in your response to

2

Justice Souter, but then you accept as sufficient his

3

merely saying thank you.

4

That's not a request.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

said there had to be some action, affirmative act of

acceptance.

a different rule from that which the State court

MS. LANDRY:

You're asking for a -- in effect,

No, we believe that the State

22

court was correct when it held that some type of

23

positive affirmation -- and that to me is the whole

question -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then are you equating

positive affirmation with request for a lawyer?
MS. LANDRY:

Yes.

I think there has to be

some action JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then on your -- then on

5

your theory, this individual's Sixth Amendment right

6

would not have attached if he had stood in the courtroom

7

and said, thank you very much, that's great.

8

MS. LANDRY:

Well, whether the Sixth

9

Amendment right attached I think is a different issue

10

from whether the Jackson rule applies to then bar any

11

police-initiated conversation with him, and the issue I

12

think in this case is whether or not his silence -- the

13

Petitioner has argued that the mere appointment of

14

counsel with nothing further by this defendant

15

constituted the request necessary under Jackson to

16

invoke the rule.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

One of my concerns is that

18

Jackson is a formality, but you're arguing for a

19

formality on top of a formality.

20

functional purpose is served by your position that he

21

has to request the lawyer at the arraignment, especially

22

when he's not versed in the law, he's in this stressful

23

situation, and you require a formalistic request on the

24

part of the defendant?

25

MS. LANDRY:

I don't know what

It just makes no sense to me.
But Your Honor, I'm not
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

requiring a formalized request on the part of the

2

defendant at the hearing.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, you're requiring some

4

kind of ritualistic phrase to indicate that he -- that

5

he accepts the appointment.

6

MS. LANDRY:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8
9

No.
That he requests the

appointment.
MS. LANDRY:

No, sir.

I believe that he can

10

remain silent, but later, just as in this case, the

11

police approach him; under Patterson they give him his

12

rights, which include right to counsel.

13

he can request and invoke, and then Jackson becomes

14

applicable because he has made a request.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

At that point

I understood you to

16

concede that if he had made that request at the 72-hour

17

hearing, the outcome of this case would be different.

18
19
20

MS. LANDRY:

Yes, because Jackson says he

can make the request JUSTICE STEVENS:

The key time is did he

21

make the request at the hearing, not at the time he was

22

confronted by the officers.

23

MS. LANDRY:

24

it either time.

25

he has to make it -

I was just saying he can make

The fallacy of their argument is that

40
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it's sufficient

2

protection for him if you presume, as is true in most

3

States, that he did make the request, then you would

4

lose.

5

know, but if we did indulge that presumption, the case

6

would be over.

7

You would argue against such a presumption, I

MS. LANDRY:

Clearly I would argue against

8

any such presumption; that's the whole reason -- the key

9

to Jackson was -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, I didn't

11

understand you to be doing that.

12

position was once there's a request, there's a request,

13

and that's enough.

14

MS. LANDRY:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I thought your

Yes, I do.
But you're also arguing, it

16

seems to me, that a request -- well, you're -- I think

17

you're arguing two different things.

18

you're arguing that a request is necessary, and yet on

19

the other hand, I understood you to concede in answer to

20

a question from me that if he had stood in the courtroom

21

in Tennessee, having been told that counsel was

22

appointed for him and had said, yes, thank you, I accept

23

that lawyer, that that would have been sufficient to

24

satisfy Jackson, and that would have made the difference

25

in this case.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

On the one hand,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Those are two different positions.

2

MS. LANDRY:

Well, but I think the question

3

boils down to whether or not the latter hypothetical,

4

"yes, I want one," whether that is enough to constitute

5

the request under Jackson.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, so far as I

7

understand it, and you correct me if I'm wrong, but as I

8

understand it, what the State Supreme Court said was not

9

that he had to make a request, "I want a lawyer," but

10

simply that he had to indicate in some way that he

11

accepted the appointment of the lawyer which he had been

12

told had been appointed for him; and that is a different

13

situation from Jackson.

14

So if -- if you are saying, yes, if he had

15

said "thank you, I accept the lawyer," that would have

16

been enough, then that in effect is -- is maintaining

17

the position that the State court took; but if you're

18

saying something more, that he had to say then or later

19

on, "I want a lawyer," then I think you're going beyond

20

the case that we have in front of us.

21

MS. LANDRY:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Am I wrong?

No, you're not wrong.
Okay.
So I -- I suppose

24

what the dialogue simply establishes is that like in any

25

situation there's going to be factual issues about
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what's a request or not.

2

court says I'm appointing Johnson, and he says,

3

"Johnson?

4

question is, is that accepting Johnson or not?

5

is that the best you can do?

6

not.

7

establish a rule that requires some request, and in the

8

odd case there will be a debate about what's a request

9

or not, but the issue is the general rule.

Is that the best you can do?"

And the
He says

Maybe it is, maybe it's

I mean, but the point is whether or not you

10
11

I mean, he could say, the

MS. LANDRY:

Yes, Your Honor, that's

correct.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I don't -- I don't --

13

I agree with Justice Souter.

14

something different from a request.

15

the State court's opinion, it was setting up a sort of

16

offer and acceptance scenario.

17

him counsel, said, "I appoint counsel," but it was

18

ineffective until he says yes, "I accept counsel,"

19

whereupon, you know, he's lawyered up, but he isn't

20

lawyered up until he says "I accept," and that's

21

something quite different from -- from requesting

22

counsel.

23

MS. LANDRY:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

I -- acceptance is
As I read the -

The State was offering

Well Now, are you -- are you

standing on the -- on the State court's analysis or not?
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. LANDRY:

Yes, Your Honor, and I think

2

the State court analysis comes from -- well, it came

3

from the Fifth Circuit case of Montoya which was very

4

similar factually, and the Fifth Circuit relied on the

5

Court's opinion in Patterson, and I believe cited a

6

footnote from Patterson that refers to, you know,

7

affirmative acceptance of the appointment of counsel.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But this is still an

artificial framework, because we know that in this case

10

he has to have a lawyer under Gideon unless he waives it

11

after being fully advised.

12

on the failure to make a request not to proceed with a

13

trial lawyer.

14

unless after he very, very careful colloquy from the

15

district judge or the trial judge, declines.

16

You couldn't rely just on -

Of course he's going to have a lawyer

So it seems to me that this -- this whole

17

framework here is quite artificial.

Now, I do think

18

there's a Miranda problem here, if we accept his -- the

19

defendant's testimony that the police told him, "oh no,

20

you don't have a lawyer."

21

issue on that.

22

Petitioner may not be quite correct in Moran v Burbine.

23

I didn't have time to talk with him about that.

24

there was no misleading; they just didn't tell him that

25

he had a lawyer.

I know there's a factual

And I -- I think the counsel for the

There

Here, assuming his version of the
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

facts is correct, they told him, "oh, no, you don't have

2

a lawyer," they affirmatively misled him, and it seems

3

to me that's a Miranda problem, if it's true, and that

4

Miranda is completely sufficient to protect his rights.

5

MS. LANDRY:

But also, if I can address that

6

factual issue, because I think it is important in the

7

context here, because the question presented to this

8

Court, the assignment of error at the Louisiana Supreme

9

Court was only premised on the fact that counsel was

10
11

appointed.
There was never any argument -- they bring

12

up the factual issues about, well, the defendant

13

testified at trial that he told them he had a lawyer,

14

and the officers testified he didn't, to make it appear

15

there's a factual issue there; but if you look back at

16

the proceedings in this case, the motion to suppress,

17

which is at the Joint Appendix page 6, never alleged any

18

of those issues.

19

were not free and voluntary.

20

It only alleged that his statements

Then the suppression hearing comes.

Now,

21

most of the effort at the suppression hearing was toward

22

the videotape which is not at issue here, but the

23

argument by the defendant's counsel on this issue was

24

merely what exactly it is here, that the mere

25

appointment of counsel was sufficient to trigger
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Jackson, and therefore everything after that should not

2

have been admitted.

3

There was never any testimony at the

4

suppression hearing by the defendant or anyone else that

5

he had been -- that he told the officers, "I've been

6

appointed counsel," "I think I've been appointed

7

counsel," "I think I might have a lawyer."

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's just that everything

after -- as far as I understand, the only piece of

10

evidence we're talking about is his condolence letter to

12

13

Because all of the Mirandized free 72-hour hearing, all

the JUSTICE BREYER:

Can I ask -- I'm getting a

19

different idea from what you're arguing.

I want to try

20

it on you and see what your response is.

It's simply

21

this, that there's something backwards about this case,

22

and what's backwards is this, that when they're talking

23

about a prophylactic rule in Jackson, what they're

24

thinking of is the following:

25

a person really has a counsel, at that point, unlike the

Everyone agrees that when

That's the prophylactic

12

talk to him.

13

You can't

Now, if that's right, your case -- I mean,

14

I'm afraid, their side, for your point of view, is a

15

fortiori for Jackson, not the borderline of Jackson.

16

Now, explain to me why I've got it wrong.

17

MS. LANDRY:

Because, in our case and in the

18

case where there's just counsel appointed, again I go

19

back to the issue, there's no request; there's no

20

positive action by the defendant constituting a request

21

in indicating that he's requesting a lawyer, which was

22

the basis of the ruling in Jackson.

23

Patterson later said, Jackson turned on the fact that

24

that defendant had asked for a lawyer.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

It was -- and

Well, isn't the prophylactic
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

aspect of Jackson not what Justice Breyer just said, but

2

the rule that a person who has a lawyer is thereafter

3

incapable of waiving the assistance of the lawyer if the

4

person wishes to speak with the police and the police

5

happen to initiate the conversation?

6

defendant who's the most experienced criminal defense

7

attorney in the world, who knows everything there is to

8

know about trial tactics, who has a lawyer and decides

9

it's in my best interest now to speak to the police.

You could have a

10

They happen to initiate it.

11

prophylactic rule that says even in that situation, it

12

can't be done.

13

Jackson, isn't it?

That's the prophylactic aspect of

sake.

But Jackson has a

Well, I would disagree Accept that, for argument's

Accept that, and then same -- same question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, why don't

you answer Justice Alito's question?
MS. LANDRY:

I was going to say that I

20

disagree to the -- to the extent that I think part of

21

the basis of Jackson was wanting to deter police from

22

badgering a defendant into waiving a right that he had

23

already asserted.

24

of Jackson, that this defendant had asserted his right

25

to counsel at the arraignment.

That was the crux, it seemed to me,

They then approached him

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

later.

And the Court found that that was a form of

2

police badgering to then approach him after he had made

3

the request for counsel.

4

of the differentiations in this case, where we talk

5

about whether there's a request for counsel.

6

And I believe that that's one

JUSTICE BREYER:

Interesting.

I think this

7

is very interesting to me because I'm learning a lot.

8

Suppose -- Let's assume Justice Alito is absolutely

9

right and that when you have a counsel, that's what

10

you've done and that's the reason why you don't talk to

11

the police, or at least they can't initiate.

12

Take that as the rationale, and now apply it to this

13

case.

14

maybe, "I accept" or not, it would have nothing to do

15

with it.

Fine.

Since he has a lawyer, whether he said yes, no,

The same rationale would apply or would it?

16

MS. LANDRY:

No, I don't think it would.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MS. LANDRY:

Because?

Because, again, the appointment

19

of counsel, as in this case, was an action taken by the

20

State.

or requesting counsel.

goes on, and then subsequently they go through the

paperwork to determine whether he's qualified -

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask you:

If the

3

case had gone to trial without any intermediate

4

proceeding -- they just show up for the day of trial -

5

and there's no record of whether he accepted the lawyer

6

earlier, would the State judge start out with the

7

presumption that Faretta would apply and he's going on

8

his own, or would they start out with the assumption

9

that he is going to have a lawyer?

10

MS. LANDRY:

No, Your Honor, because,

11

obviously, just as Patterson discussed, the waiver issue

12

is much different when you're talking about a defendant

13

proceeding through a legal proceeding representing

14

himself than it is in the context here.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you're drawing a

16

distinction between this -- the kind of proceeding

17

that's involved?

18

deciding whether to confess, but he does need help if

19

they go to trial?

20

He doesn't really need help on

MS. LANDRY:

Well, it's not that he doesn't

21

need help, but he's advised of his right to counsel and

22

can voluntarily choose, exercise his own free will,

23

whether he wants counsel or not.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There's an irony in this

case that Justice Kennedy put a finger on earlier:
50
Alderson Reporting Company

If

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there were a civil case, whether you could go talk to a

2

lawyer -- a client, rather, who was represented by a

3

lawyer, the answer would be quite clear:

4

as a matter of professional ethics.

5

MS. LANDRY:

true of the -

7

JUSTICE STEVEN:

And the Constitution gives

8

less protection than the -- than the professional ethics

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, the usual legal

11

rule is that silence implies consent, right?

12

prosecution of Thomas More.

13

why shouldn't we assume consent just from the fact that

14

he stood silent?

15

MS. LANDRY:

Read the

That's the legal rule.

So

Because, again, in Jackson, the

16

assertion or the request for counsel is what implies to

17

the police that this defendant does not want to deal

18

with the police on his own, that he wishes to only

19

communicate through counsel.

20

right that attached and his right to counsel is just

21

that:

22

And the Sixth Amendment

It's a right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Landry, you're trying

to explain your position, let's assume, to an

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That was one
Now, we

But, Mr. Verrilli -

-- but quite clear -- you just struck two

22

chords:

One, harmless error; the other, that this

23

defendant testified at his trial.

24

defendant's statements, although he wasn't given his

25

Jackson right, can come in by way of impeachment if he

We have held that a

53
Alderson Reporting Company

1

testifies.

2

accept everything you say, the -- that condolence letter

3

could have been used for impeachment purposes.

4

So in this defendant's case, even if we

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes.

We don't contest that,

5

Justice Ginsburg.

6

impeachment purposes; it was used in fact as substantive

7

evidence, and there was no limiting instruction to let

8

the jury know that it could only be considered for that

9

limited purpose.

10
11

Of course, it wasn't used for

And I don't think that suffices even

remotely to overcome the harmless error problem here.
The second point of clarification, it does

12

seem to me clear, both from pages 14 and 15 of

13

Respondent's brief and Respondent's argument here today

14

and in particular the citation to the Montoya case in

15

the Fifth Circuit, they are not advocating a request

16

rule; they are advocating a request or assertion rule.

17

In fact, the very passage in Montoya to which

18

Respondent's counsel adverts -- it says there doesn't

19

have to be a request so long as there is an assertion.

20

And that's the principle they're advocating.

21

It just doesn't make any sense as a sensible dividing

22

line between categories of defendants who are protected

23

by Jackson and those who aren't for the reasons that we

24

have discussed.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Verrilli, I don't

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

understand your response to Justice Ginsburg.

2

it seems to me, if this thing was going to come in

3

anyway, how could you possibly say it was harmful and

4

not harmless error?

5

MR. VERRILLI:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean,

Well, it would come What difference does it

7

make whether it's introduced in the case in chief or

8

whether it's introduced to refute the defendant's

9

assertion that he didn't do it?

10

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, if it's introduced in

11

the case in chief, it's substantive evidence on which

12

the prosecution relied or can rely to establish the

13

case.

14

There were two confessions, one admissible, the other

15

inadmissible.

16

of the two that made it not a harmless error for

17

Fulminante.

18

It's very much like Fulminante in that regard.

And it was the self-reinforcing character

We really have the same thing.
But, if I could, I would like to get back,

19

Justice Kennedy, to the Moran case.

I do think, with

20

all due respect, there was an element of deception in

21

Moran that was sanctioned as consistent with Miranda.

22

Two things happened there:

23

lawyer that they -- incorrectly, falsely -- that they

24

weren't going to interrogate him, but they also failed

25

to inform Moran that he had a lawyer, and the lawyer was

The police informed Moran's

55
Alderson Reporting Company

1

standing out there.

2

deception as telling somebody he doesn't have a lawyer

3

when he does, or withholding information that made a big

4

difference for Sixth Amendment purposes, which is why

5

the Court in Moran drew that line very sharply and said,

6

for Fifth Amendment purposes, the Sixth Amendment right

7

hasn't attached, there isn't an interference with the

8

attorney-client relationship, but the very same thing

9

would be forbidden under the Sixth Amendment.

10

And that's fully as much of a

And Patterson says exactly the same thing.

11

In Patterson, again -- just to conclude, Justice Breyer

12

-- drew the line exactly where Your Honor's hypothetical

13

drew it.

14

does not have a lawyer, we operate one way; when a

15

defendant has a lawyer, a different set of rules kick

16

in.

17

in even if a defendant requests a lawyer, making clear

18

that the point of extending to request was to put

19

defendants who have asked for lawyers but don't have

20

them yet in the same position as defendants who have

21

lawyers, not to give them a superior Sixth Amendment

22

protection.

What Patterson says is that, if a defendant

And then, it says, indeed the different rules kick

23

Thank you.
