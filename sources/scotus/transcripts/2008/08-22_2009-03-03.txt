ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a

12

fundamental constitutional right.

13

the absence of actual bias, but a guarantee against even

14

the probability of an unfair tribunal.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

Who says?

In short Have we ever

held that?

17
18

That means not only

MR. OLSON:

You have said that in the

Murchison case and in a number of cases, Your Honor.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. OLSON:

A guarantee against even -

Yes, the language of the

21

Murchison case specifically says so.

The Court said in

22

that case:

23

requirement of due process.

24

requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of

25

cases, but our system of law has always endeavored to

"A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic
Fairness, of course,

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prevent even the probability of unfairness."

2

And in that paragraph, the Court goes on -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. OLSON:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

Pardon?
"Has always endeavored."

"Has always endeavored."

7

MR. OLSON:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

"Has always endeavored."

Yes, but that's And there are rules in the

States that do endeavor to do that.

10

MR. OLSON:

But the Court has said that

11

frequently, not only the probability of bias, the

12

appearance of bias, the likelihood of bias, the inherent

13

suspicion of bias.

14

in the context -- a series of contexts or cases.

15
16

The Court has repeatedly said that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
loose term.

"Probability" is a

What -- what percentage is probable -

17

MR. OLSON:

Well -

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you've a 50

19

percent chance of bias, a 10 percent chance?

20

means more than 50?

21

MR. OLSON:

Probable

It's probable cause, Mr. Chief

22

Justice.

The Court frequently decides questions

23

involving due process, equal protection, probable cause,

24

speedy trial, on the basis not of mathematical

25

certainty, but in this case where an objective observer
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would come to the conclusion -- knowing all of the

2

facts, would come to the conclusion that a judge or

3

jurist would probably be biased against that individual

4

or in favor of his opponent, that would be sufficient

5

under the Due Process Clause, we submit.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

Does it mean the same

thing as likelihood of bias?

8
9

The Court -

MR. OLSON:

The Court -- the Court, Justice

Ginsburg, has used the changes interchangeably.

We

10

think the probably -- the "probable" standard is the one

11

we would advance to this Court.

12

seminal case, the Tumey case, said that even if there

13

was a possibility -- any procedure where there would be

14

a possible temptation for the judge not to hold the

15

balance nice, clear, and true, would be the standard.

16

But -- and the Aetna -- in the Aetna v. Lavoie case not

17

very many years ago, the Court repeated that standard,

18

and that standard has been repeated again and again.

19

The likelihood or the possibility or even the temptation

20

--

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you claim that there is

such a temptation here because of gratitude?

MR. OLSON:

Well, let me put it this way,

3

Justice Scalia.

4

it would be very difficult for a judge to hold the

5

balance nice, square, and true when that judge has just

6

been put on the bench during the pendency of the trial

7

of the case by his opponent's contribution of $3 million

8

to his election.

9

If -- an ordinary person would say that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but that -- that

10

person contributed money to my election because he

11

expected me to be a fair and impartial judge.

12

would be faithful to that contributor only by being a

13

fair and impartial judge.

14

should do what he expected me to do, and I have no

15

reason to think he expected me to lie and distort cases

16

in order to come out his way.

17

me to do was to be a good judge, and I'm being faithful

18

to him and I'm -- I'm showing my gratitude by -- by

19

being a good judge.

20

MR. OLSON:

And I

That is showing gratitude.

I

What I expected he wanted

Well, I would go back to the

21

words of this court in the Tumey case, the seminal case:

22

"Due process is not satisfied by the argument that men

23

of highest honor and greatest self-sacrifice could carry

24

it out without danger of injustice."

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It isn't a matter of honor

and sacrifice.

2

consists of is coming out in favor of this fellow, but

3

that is not necessarily what gratitude consists of.

4

Gratitude consists of performing the way this person

5

would like me to perform.

6

acknowledge that you seem to have a contribution based

7

upon more.

did he?

Well, it's not clear.

There is

This contributor never even met the judge,

MR. OLSON:

12

You talk as though what gratitude

MR. OLSON:

We're not claiming that there is

a basis based on personal relationship, Your Honor.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And his contributions, as I

16

understand it, were mainly based upon his opposition to

17

the incumbent, who he thought was an activist judge that

18

-- that was distorting the tort law of the State, all in

19

favor of the plaintiffs' bar.

20

contribution were to engender any gratitude, it seems to

21

me it would simply be that this other candidate would do

22

what he promised in his campaign and that is not be an

23

activist judge and not distort the tort law of the

24

State.

25

MR. OLSON:

And if -- if the

Well, if I can address part of

the premise of your question and invite the Court to

2

look at page 188a of the joint appendix.

3

the point that you just made that he was contributing

4

his money to defeat Justice McGraw as opposed to

5

supporting Justice Benjamin.

6

those financial disclosure reports that's required by

7

West Virginia law.

It's filed by Mr. Blankenship and it

8

says on that page:

"Expenditures made to support or

9

oppose," and he underlines the word "support," and then

10
11

This addresses

On page 188a is one of

he types in the word "Brent Benjamin."
Then if you'll turn over to page 200a, which

12

is the last page of that report, that shows that he

13

directly spent $508,000 of his own money to support

14

Justice Benjamin.

15

Now, to the larger part of your point, the

16

context of this case suggests that, while the appeal was

17

going to be coming to the -- to the West Virginia

18

Supreme Court, Mr. Blankenship, who was the CEO,

19

chairman, major stockholder and a -- the prime mover in

20

the case that gave rise to liability in this case,

21

decided to unseat Justice McGraw, who he thought would

22

be unfavorable to him, and elect Justice Benjamin, who

23

he thought would be favorable to him.

MR. OLSON:

I think that -- I think the

5

answer probably is not, Chief Justice Roberts, but this

6

is, like your cases involving reasonable search and

7

seizure, it's going to require an analysis of the

8

complex of circumstances.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's just

10

take this case, the same amount of money, except it's

11

not from an individual, not from that individual's

12

company, but from ten different ones, and divide it up

13

by ten.

14

MR. OLSON:

I think the Court would -- a

15

reasonable objective observer knowing all of the facts

16

would not feel that that -- that trade group was not a

17

party to the case, who is not personally involved in

18

having a personal stake in the election or the outcome

19

of that particular case, but may be interested in a

20

panoply of cases or judges that approach things in a

21

certain way; that would not give rise to what you're

22

concerned about here.

18

that the possibility that a $12 benefit, the Tumey case,

19

might ultimately come to the judge is a disqualifying

interest.

might receive some fines -

case and that interest leads to the likelihood of -

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. OLSON:

10

No, they don't say that.

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There are only two

11

categories of cases, only two categories.

12

where the judge is almost the aggrieved party in

13

conducting contempt proceedings against someone who is

14

contemptuous of that very judge, and the other one is

15

cases where the judges have a financial interest.

That's far from this broad category of whenever there is

a possibility of bias.

MR. OLSON:

I respectfully submit, Justice

Scalia, that in the Monroeville case the judge didn't

He had what the

Court called a partisan interest because the money that

MR. OLSON:

In the first place, there is a

6

-- there is a significant difference with respect to the

7

framers of the Constitution who gave the members of this

8

Court and the Federal Judiciary life tenure for the very

9

purpose of ensuring the independence of the judiciary.

10

There is a separate consideration that this Court has

mentioned because of the fact that judges and justices

of this Court cannot be replaced if they feel that they

must recuse themselves.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then, my -- my

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

question in this case is this:

2

certiorari you said that, well, by the time you came

3

here you would have a standard for us that we can work

with.

favor means that law and motion practice will -- could

9

your standard is.

10

In your petition for

Disqualification for bias will now become a -

Your standard is an unacceptable risk of

11

impropriety or perception of bias, but I -- I need some

12

more specific standards within which to fit this case.

13

You give a general standard, and then we hear about the

14

amount of the contribution.

15

it was a contested election, et cetera.

16

MR. OLSON:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We hear about the fact that

It would be But your -- your standard

18

of -- of impropriety doesn't, it seems to me, give

19

sufficient -- or "unacceptable risk of bias" doesn't

20

give sufficient guidance to the courts to implement this

21

rule unless it's just -- it's just going to be one case.

22

Now, I know the law evolves on a case-by-case system.

23

understand that, but it doesn't seem to me that the

24

standard you offer us is specific enough.

25

MR. OLSON:

Well, there are several answers
15

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

to that.

2

Justices of all of the States of the United States filed

They also said that -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Was their standard the same

7

as yours?

I mean, that's frankly one of the problems in

8

this case.

9

with, you know, a wide divergence of standards.

The various amici and -- and you come up
And all

10

of them say:

By the way, these seven factors or five

11

factors or six factors, whatever they say, are not

12

exhaustive; There may be others as well.

13

MR. OLSON:

That's -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. OLSON:

Right?

That's because, Justice Scalia,

16

the -- the jurisprudence of this Court in connection

17

with standards like due process or probable cause or

18

speedy trial or equal protection can't be nailed down

19

with levels of specificity.

20

--

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It would be very inviting

I want you to articulate

22

some substandards that have -- that are general in

23

nature, that apply to this case, substandards that are

24

more specific than the probability of bias.

25

MR. OLSON:

Well, I -- I -- the reason we 16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we approached it from that standpoint, Justice Kennedy,

2

is the probability of bias is something that this Court

3

has said repeatedly.

4

this way:

5

of the contribution, the magnitude and proportion of the

6

contribution, are such that it would lead a reasonable

7

person in possession of all of the facts -- these are

8

all words from these courts' decisions -- to believe

9

that the judge would have a difficult time being other

10

than biased in favor of one of the parties, that would

11

be the standard that would be applied.

standard, but -

So that's an -- an additional factor.

Is that just one of a laundry list, or is
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that central to your view that there is really an

2

appearance of impropriety here?

3

MR. OLSON:

It is very much central, but

4

it's not exclusively central.

If the -- and -- and that

5

is absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg.

6

through 65a of the joint appendix, for example, are the

7

specific post-trial motion findings of the judge saying

declared to be fraudulent and a deliberate effort to

would come along in a case where there would be a very

17

small amount of money, and someone -- that -- that all

18

of those situations are distinguishable.

of Chief Justices specifically said, to get back to

are they proposing something comparable to us?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

Mr. Olson, the

22

very fact that they do raises what I think is one of the

23

difficult issues in this case, and it's raised by -

24

specifically by the -- the brief of the nine States,

25

Alabama and so on.

And -- and I would put it this way.
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

It's not exactly the way that brief did, but I see the

2

problem that you are -- that you are addressing as -- as

3

not only a procedural, but certainly to a degree a

4

substantive due process kind of problem.

5

One of the factors that goes into the

6

recognition of at least a substantive limitation when

7

there has been none before is -- is the issue of timing.

8

Is the political process in fact working now toward a

9

solution?

Because if it is, that kind of ethos of total

10

unreasonability is -- is still being worked out, and -

11

and the courts ought to stay their hands.

12

question is, what do you say to the argument that there

13

is a political process going on addressing this issue?

14

And I forget the details, but my recollection is that it

15

may well have been that brief pointed out that the State

16

of West Virginia itself has enacted some legislation

17

since these events began to transpire.

18

So my

So the nut of the question is, is

19

the political process in process and is that a good

20

reason for us to stay our hand in recognizing a new

21

procedural or substantive due process right at this

22

point?

23

MR. OLSON:

I think there are -- there are

more than one answer to that question.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is my recollection correct

14

that West Virginia has, in fact, enacted some kind of

15

limiting legislation?

16

MR. OLSON:

I believe that is correct, but I

17

don't think that would have addressed the problem in

18

this case.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought they closed the

20

527 loophole that allowed him to contribute so much

21

above the individual limit.

22

MR. OLSON:

Irrespective of that, I was

23

going to go on and answer this in response to Justice

24

Souter's question.

25

think, provide a second answer to that question.

The Conference of Chief Justices, I

Alderson Reporting Company

They

1

are the ones where the rubber meets the road, so to

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, they propose a

6

seven-factor test, and all of the other amici, who know

a lot about this subject, propose multifactor tests.

8

Public Citizen has ten factors, the ABA has four

9

In an effort to see if this can be put in more

10

concrete terms, I wonder if you would be willing to say

11

categorically that your -- the holding that you're

12

proposing would not apply under any of these situations:

13

Where the judges are appointed, where there are massive

14

contributions and a hotly contested election, but the

15

issue is not an economic issue, it's a social issue;

16

where there isn't any specific issue headed for the

17

court but there are massive contributions by, let's say,

18

the plaintiffs' bar and the defense bar?

19

categorically in any of those situations that your rule

20

would not apply?

Could you say

MR. OLSON:

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22

MR. FREY:

23
24
25

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
First of all, just on the West Virginia
statutory amendment, they did, as Justice Scalia
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suggested, close the 527 loophole and limit

2

contributions by individuals to 527 groups to $1,000

3

after the 2004 election in response to the concern about

4

the amount of money that was being spent through 527

5

groups in that election.

6

where the States are dealing with it legislatively and,

7

and as I hope to get to in a minute or two, the Court

8

has recognized that this is -- repeatedly recognized

9

that this is something that is meant to be dealt with

So I think this is a situation

10

through legislative or canons of judicial ethics or

11

codes.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How is it -- is it -

13

this Court's decision in the Republican Party of

14

Minnesota said that judges could say anything, just as a

legislator.

election is an election to this area of the appearance

17

of impropriety?

18

judge is elected just like a legislator is elected, and

19

groups?

21

Are you extending that notion that an

22

that Justice Benjamin was in the least beholden to

23

anybody in this case.

25

an election to speak their position on issues.

But the Republican Party case was

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sure that I follow what this has to do with this case.

2

But I will say that this is not a case about

3

appearances.

4

They've -- the other side has withdrawn or it has

5

abandoned an appearance argument, and with good reason

6

because the Due Process Clause -

7

The petition was about appearances.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Frey, is it your

8

position that the appearance of impropriety could never

9

be strong enough to raise a constitutional issue?

10

MR. FREY:

Well, we might have appearance of

11

impropriety overlapping with conditions that would

12

justify -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm assuming appearances

14

only.

Are you saying that appearances without any

15

actual proof of bias could never be sufficient as a

16

constitutional matter?

17

MR. FREY:

I think we are.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

MR. FREY:

Is that your position?

We are saying that the Due

20

Process Clause does not exist to protect the integrity

21

or reputation of the State judicial systems.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24
25

Why That's not an answer to my

question.
MR. FREY:

Well, I thought I said 27

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Supposing, for example,

2

the judge had campaigned on the ground that he would

3

issue favorable rulings to the United Mine Workers, and

4

the United Mine Workers campaigned, raising money

5

saying, we want to get a judge who will rule in our

6

favor in all the cases we're interested in.

7

create an appearance of impropriety?

8

MR. FREY:

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would that

Well Or take another example.

10

The Chief Justice asked what if there are ten members of

11

a trade association and would all -- and they all

12

contributed to get a judge to vote in their favor in a

13

case that involved a conspiracy charge among the -

14

charged the ten of them for violations of the Sherman

15

Act, something like that.

16

money publicly for the very purpose of getting a judge

17

who would rule favorably in their favor, that would

18

clearly create a very extreme appearance of impropriety.

19

Would that be sufficient, in your judgment, to raise a

20

constitutional issue?

21

MR. FREY:

And if all ten of them raise

If you were -- if -- if you

22

thought there was no basis for believing there was

23

actual bias, but it looked bad -

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, it would meet the test

in the -- in the judges' brief of an average judge would
28
Alderson Reporting Company

1

be tempted under the circumstances.

2

that the Conference of Chief Justices judges -

MR. FREY:

That's the test

That I don't And do you think that

5

could ever, just appearance, could ever raise a due

process issue?

could ever raise a due process issue.

11

No, I don't think just appearance

JUSTICE STEVENS:

facts?
MR. FREY:

The question is whether there is

25

whether we have, but whether we should.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FREY:

I hope to address that question.

2

Let me start off by pointing out, as Justice Benjamin

3

said in his opinion on discussing the recusal issue, his

4

July opinion, which I commend to the Court, he is being

5

asked to recuse on the basis of activities of a third

6

party over which he had no control, in a case whose

7

disposition offers him no current or future personal

8

benefit, and where he has no personal connection with

9

the parties or their counsel, has expressed no opinion

10

about any of them.

He has done nothing that would call

11

into question his objectivity, his impartiality.

12

I think that's a very important point.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the view that

14

Benjamin should not be the judge of his own cause?

15

Wasn't -- wasn't it -- it was either Massey, the

16

company, or Blankenship that brought a 1983 action

17

insisting on that very point, that in recusal matter -

18

-

19

MR. FREY:

Well, that -

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- it wasn't -- well,

21

maybe you can tell me what that 1983 suit was.

22

charge -

23

MR. FREY:

It was a

Yes, it challenged the procedure.

24

That's not an issue that's before the Court here, and

25

our -- our position today is that this Court has
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

consistently allowed recusal matters to be decided by a

2

-- the single justice who is challenged.

3

the Court thinks it's unconstitutional to do that.

4

I understand the -- the concerns about

5

having the judge making the decision about whether

6

recusal is required, but that is not the practice of

7

this Court, and if it's not the practice of this Court I

8

frankly doubt it's unconstitutional.

9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it was the position

that Blankenship took?

11
12

I don't think

MR. FREY:
Blankenship.

13

Well, it was -- no, not

Massey.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it may not be per se

14

unconstitutional, but it is certainly one contributing

15

factor, it seems to me, to the argument that the system

16

that we have depended on up to this point is not working

17

very well.

18

MR. FREY:

Well, I don't think -- I don't

Well, I -- as I understand

it, although you never directly, I don't think you ever

25

response to Justice Stevens that there would be no

constitutional standard.

recusal, a nonconstitutional statutory standard for

recusal in virtually every State, so we already have -

12

and in the Federal system, so -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

And we have -- and we

14

have an appearance standard under the ABA Canons, but I

argument that that standard was effective in this case.

But would you agree that the ABA

MR. FREY:

I think I would agree that

reasonable people could have a different view one way or

4

the other about whether there is an appearance of

5

impropriety for Justice Benjamin sitting.

6

with that.

7

because my personal view is that there was no

8

impropriety, that it was reasonable, and if you read his

9

opinion I think you'll see a -- a fair, balanced,

I would agree

I don't think I would go further than that

10

thoughtful statement of the reasons why he feels he

11

could sit.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I want you to be able to

13

elaborate your full theory of the case, but just so you

14

know, it -- it does seem to me that the appearance

standard has -- has much to recommend it.

16

means that you don't have to inquire into the actual

17

bias; it's -- it's more objective.

18

has to be controlled, it has to be precise.

20

inclination.

But I just

But -- but we're here on the

22

question of constitutional requirements and the

And we're asking -- we're

asking what substance we can give to the constitutional
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

protection.

2

MR. FREY:

Well, what you're really asking

3

is whether you should abandon what is a fairly clearly

4

stated rule and practice of this Court, dating back to

5

the common law, that questions of bias in general as

6

opposed to interest are matters for legislative

7

resolution and not for -- not for constitutional -

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course the appearance

standard is -- is wonderfully ratchetable.

Once it is

10

clearly established that a certain -- certain set of

11

facts creates the appearance of impropriety, that is

12

solidly established, then the set of facts right next to

13

that suddenly acquires the appearance of impropriety

14

because it's so -- it's so close to what is obviously

15

improper.

16

And I -- I personally don't favor a constitutional rule

17

that is a sliding scale like that.

18
19

And -- and so we go down and down and down.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, you can stop at

what is obviously improper.

20

MR. FREY:

I don't -- I think, first of all,

21

the Petitioner has not advanced on the merits in this

22

case an appearance standard.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

A lot of the Would you please clarify

24

that?

Because I was taking appearance, likelihood,

25

probability as all synonyms, and I think of Justice
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Marshall's decision in Peters and Kiff, involving a

2

grand jury, and he said that due process is denied in

3

circumstances creating the likelihood or the appearance

4

of bias.

5

those terms interchangeably.

6

probability of bias, likelihood of bias, appearance -

7

that -- those seem to me synonyms.

8
9

And there are other decisions, too, that use

MR. FREY:

So I don't know that

All right.

Well, if you're

viewing them as cinnamons -- synonyms, then the question

10

is whether that kind of standard is a -- is the

11

constitutional standard; and let me say about the Tumey

12

case which -- the "possible temptation" language in the

13

Tumey case, which is of course a wide open standard:

14

That was discussed only after the Court said questions

15

of bias are not constitutional, they're for the

16

legislature; questions of interest, pecuniary interest

17

in the Tumey case, are.

18

Olson quoted came in the discussion of the question of

19

whether the pecuniary interest was substantial enough to

20

create a disqualification, constitutional

21

disqualification.

22

And then the language that Mr.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I think you're quite

23

right in the way you describe Tumey, but I wonder why is

24

that the reason -- why is appearance never

25

constitutional?

Why should that be?
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Can you talk about

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that?

2

MR. FREY:

Because it seems to me to be -

3

if we're talking about appearance as distinct from

4

actual bias or probable -- you know, I can understand a

5

rule that says the probability of bias is enough.

6

think it would be a very ill-advised rule without

7

historical foundation, without foundation in the Court's

8

precedents, and open-ended and creating all kinds of

9

problems; but I can understand that rule.

I

That at least

10

is addressed to the right of the party to get a fair

11

trial.

12

Appearance is addressed to a different

13

thing.

It's addressed to the reputation of the judicial

14

system, which is not, I think, the function of the Due

15

Process Clause to address.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. FREY:

Because I think the Due Process

Clause is concerned with the fairness of the JUSTICE STEVENS:

You don't think the

community's confidence in the way judges behave is an

21

important part of due process?

22

MR. FREY:

No, I think it's -- it may be a

23

systemically important value.

But I think as long as

24

the judge is impartial in the -- in the case at hand, I

don't think there's a problem.

quibble here, where the real question is, is possibility

of bias, a temptation of bias, a subconscious effect

that -- even a probability of bias, whatever -- there's

a lot of different standards that have been put

forward -- is that a constitutional basis for

17

disqualifying a judge, A?

18

basis under the debt of gratitude theory?

20

the debt of gratitude theory is a viable theory -- for

MR. FREY:

the debt of gratitude would not qualify.

MR. FREY:

Let me say just one point about

probability of bias, which is conceptually -- the rule

is quite clear at common law, as the Court knows, that

that was not a ground for disqualification of a judge.

That's the point I wanted to

it had the issue of bias.

judges should be elected; the issue is whether -

MR. FREY:

Yes, I understand, and the

question is whether that -- that gives rise to bias.

whether the debt of gratitude theory, which I take it is

why somebody would conclude -- why a court would

4

You have to ask yourself what is the reason

And let me say that one of the key elements

5

which is not mentioned by the other side which is very

6

important is the presumption of impartiality.

7

back to Coke and Blackstone.

Judges are clothed with a

8

presumption of impartiality.

There has to be something

9

that overcomes that presumption.

It goes

And let me say that, I

10

ask the Court to ask yourselves if you were in Justice

11

Benjamin's situation, do you really think you would be

12

incapable of rendering an impartial decision in a case

13

involving Massey?

14

if the answer to that is you would not be incapable of

15

rendering an unbiased decision, then there's no

16

justification for saying that Justice Benjamin would -

The problem with debt of gratitude is that

here, then you have the question about all the other

all those things that are listed by the chief justices

serious risk that there will be bias, even though an

individual might not be.

There is a serious risk.

fair if you were in Justice Benjamin's position?

4

virtually impossible to prove, the counsel of -- the

5

6

can't ever determine that.

8

That,

We

And so the question is what is -- is someone
likely to be biased, likely to be unfair?

9

And, Justice Kennedy, one of the factors

10

that led us to the conclusion that an objective

11

standard, that a reasonable person knowing all of the

12

facts would probably be biased is language from a number

13

of these court -- this Court's decisions, including your

14

concurrence in the Liteky case -- I think it's Liteky,

15

L-I-T-E-K-Y -- in which you said the objective observer

16

would entertain reasonable questions about the judge's

17

impartiality.

18

Now, that's a case involving section 455 and

19

not the Due Process Clause, but I think the logic with

20

respect to the application of the test and the ability

of this Court and other courts to apply it, as the

Now, the language that I think is important

1

is from the Tumey case, might not a defendant with

2

reason say that he would fear he would not get a fair

3

trial.

4

asks, would you be fair, which is not the standard

5

because actual bias isn't the test, would there be a

6

perception, likelihood, probability appearance of bias,

7

to use the language used by this Court over and over

8

again.

9

So instead of the question that my opponent

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

MR. OLSON:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about -

Ask yourself this question What about

12

protective donations?

13

million, but a couple hundred thousand to somebody you

14

don't want deciding your case.

15

say, you have to recuse yourself because -

16

MR. OLSON:

You actually give, not three

And it comes up, and you

As this Court has said, I think,

17

in one of the cases that you can't allow a litigant to

18

try to game the system in that way.

19

to instead of the question -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What I was getting

How do you know?

21

mean, are you saying it's going to be clear in every

22

case that the judge is going to rule against the

23

particular entity?

24
25

MR. OLSON:

I

It's not going to be clear in

every case, Mr. Chief Justice.

It's going to be would a

55

detached observer conclude that a fair and impartial

2

hearing would be possible?

3

that Mr. Frey was asking whether you, yourself, could be

4

-- I would like to ask you to ask this question.

5

this was going to be the judge in your case, would you

6

think it would be fair and would it be a fair tribunal

7

if the judge in your case was selected with a $3 million

8

subsidy by your opponent?

9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If

Is that a reasonable

person that's making that inquiry, is that the standard?

11
12

So instead of the question

MR. OLSON:

That is the standard that

this -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Would a

14

reasonable person think it's a ground for recusal if the

15

lawyer and the judge were very close friends?

16

MR. OLSON:

No, I don't think so.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't think so?

18

A reasonable person comes up and says I socialize all

19

the time, you know, they were at each other's weddings,

20

whatever it is, we know that that's not a basis for

21

recusal.

22

MR. OLSON:

Then if it was a basis for a

23

recusal, you would have to be recusing all the time,

24

because that is a standard that's reasonable question of

25

impartiality is in section 455, it is in many of the

State codes.

2

the time.

3

back to Justice Stevens' and Justice Breyer's question,

4

this is a situation where there has got to be some

5

limits.

6

The courts handle these decisions all of

These are factors, and I think I would go

Our opponents say there's -- bias tribunals

7

are not prohibited by the Due Process Clause nor

8

probably biased or the appearance of bias.

9

there has to be some constitutional limit.
