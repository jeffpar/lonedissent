ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. HILLIARD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. HILLIARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

15-year-old Sergio Hernandez was standing in

12

Mexico, barely across the border, unthreatening and

13

unarmed, when he was shot and killed by a U.S. Border

14

Patrol agent standing inside the United States.

15

This tragic case is one of the most simplest

16

extraterritorial cases this Court will ever have in

17

front of it for five reasons.

18

First, all of the conduct of the domestic

19

police officer happened inside the United States.

20

Second, it was a civilian domestic police officer.

21

Third it was a civilian plaintiff, not an enemy

22

combatant.

23

25

the claim.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So is that -- I was trying

2

to figure out from your brief what exactly your rule is.

3

So are all five of those necessary, in your view, for

4

there to be a Bivens claim?

5

Is that exactly the rule that you want us to adopt?

6

MR. HILLIARD:

Is anything else necessary?

Justice Kagan, the rule that

7

we're asking this Court to adopt to avoid the anomalous

8

result, when a U.S. domestic officer on U.S. soil shoots

9

and there's no constitutional constraints, is that when

10

there is a cross-border shooting involving a Federal law

11

enforcement officer on U.S. soil, and the resulting

12

injury is in close proximity, then Fourth Amendment

13

constraints on that officer should apply.

14

And --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's a --

16

that's a test that, surprisingly, fits the exact facts

17

of your case.

18

(Laughter.)

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me that

20

the principles you're arguing for can't be so narrowly

21

confined.

I'm assuming that there was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Here, in our

So if this were, in

7

your case, somebody from the -- the State National Guard

8

or whatever, then it'd be a different result?

9

MR. HILLIARD:

Well, if it was a State

10

National Guard, I'm not sure that they would be shooting

11

across the border, Your Honor.

12

I mean --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you can

13

imagine a situation that is not precisely like the facts

14

of your case where military officials may be involved.

15

MR. HILLIARD:

I can imagine that scenario,

16

but that's not the purpose or the intent of this rule.

17

The purpose of intent -- and intent of our rule is

18

simply to involve this Court in addressing an ongoing

19

domestic routine law enforcement issue along our

20

southwest border.

MR. HILLIARD:
Justice Ginsburg.

6

That's right, Justice --

And we -- and we also recognize --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I understand

7

that, but I'm trying to see what the logic is, other

8

than yours happened to involve a nonmilitary actor and

9

my hypothetical involves a military actor.

Under a -- a

10

Bivens analysis, I'm not sure that that makes a

11

difference.

12

Maybe there will be some defenses once you

13

recognize the cause of action that have to do with the

14

military operation, but I'm not sure why you wouldn't

15

have a cause of action under your theory.

16

MR. HILLIARD:

Our theory is meant to -- to

17

address the ongoing problem along the southwest border

18

that has resulted in at least ten cross-border shootings

19

and six Mexican national deaths.

20

Constitution, according to the government, turns off at

21

the border, even though all the conduct happens in the

22

United States.

And every time the

I recognize that under the military

24

situation, there are orders that may be being followed.

Here we have a rogue officer who actually is not

That's what the Chief Justice brought in.
And are we, in deciding for you, A, deciding

18

as well that anyone who suffers a drone strike can come

19

to New York and bring a law case?

20

the matter is unclear so that when the proper

there is a Bivens claim and there is a Fourth Amendment

Mr. Hilliard, if -Well, your rule

My rule may be the same, but

my response to the question wouldn't have as much meat

on it because we're here after many of these shootings

And we're here because the interaction

10

of the Border Patrol in this area, the government has

taken the position that on the border, the Constitution

turns off if the deadly force goes across the border.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

question.

only for people who are within the United States;

16

therefore, an alien injured abroad has no Fourth or

17

Fifth Amendment rights.

18

It has been argued that the Constitution is

How do you answer that?

MR. HILLIARD:

Well, I think that the

19

Boumediene made clear, Justice Ginsburg, that aliens

20

abroad have constitutional rights, depending on whether

21

or not there is a -- after the evaluation, whether

22

functionally, the Constitution should apply.

23

has --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This Court

But that was dealing with

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. HILLIARD:

That was dealing with habeas.

2

But the Boumediene court did a full survey of the

3

entirety of the extraterritory -- extraterritory cases,

4

and they said there's a common thread.

5

Now, what this Court does is it looks at,

6

where are we sending this -- where are we sending the

7

Constitution and what are we asking it to do?

8

acknowledge and recognize and this Court has already

9

said it's not a worldwide Constitution.

And I

But it has gone

10

abroad many times, depending on what it needs to do and

11

what it's being asked to do.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think you said what your

13

rule is in a pretty clear way.

14

it's a border area and the shot came from the United

15

States.

16

You've said essentially

So that, I take it, is your rule.
So it seems to me that the harder question

17

is actually -- and this goes back to the Chief Justice's

18

question -- why is that your rule?

19

that confluence of factors different from everything

20

else?

21

MR. HILLIARD:

You know, what makes

Justice Kagan, the reason

22

that's our rule is because the interaction at the

23

border, at our southwest border, has -- has resulted

24

often in shots being fired across the border.

unique to Sergio Hernandez.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess you keep

2

saying that, Mr. Hilliard, that there's a problem here,

and I respect that.

4

might be problems in other situations as well.

5

might be problems when U.S. officials go into a foreign

nation's territory.

7

uncertain why -- I mean, you're saying as a practical

8

matter, this is where the incidents are.

9

all you have as to why this is your rule, why the border

11

But there are problems -- there
There

So -- so that leaves me still

But is that

cases are different?
MR. HILLIARD:

So using the -- the framework

12

of Boumediene and the factors in Boumediene, and given

13

that this fact pattern is unique to the case we're here

14

about today, but not unique to the situation on the

15

border, yeah, the Boumediene factors are -- are used to

16

plug in the rule that we're asking for.

17

For example, the -- the Boumediene factors

18

are nature of the site, status of the person seeking the

19

constitutional protection, importance of the right.

20

those factors we plugged into this rule to address not

21

just this specific problem, but in reliance on the

22

Boumediene opinion, which said there's a common thread

23

in all these cases.

24

we took the -- we took the four elements of -- of the

25

framework of Boumediene and applied them into our rule.

So

And as the functional application,

Again, I would invite the Court to look at

that's true of a lot of borders.
MR. HILLIARD:

Well -- and the reason that

11

that's important in regards to the truth of that

statement is because the United States exercises some

13

degree of control into the culvert.

the United States shoots bullets into their land and

21

kills their citizens.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The question is

23

whether the government of Mexico agrees with your

statement that the jurisdiction of the United States

25

extends beyond the Mexican border.

MR. HILLIARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, at -- it

2

was not that the jurisdiction extends beyond the border.

3

It's that the control projects from our physical border

4

as Michael Fisher, the head of Border Patrol said,

5

outward.

6

The -- the government of Mexico has not addressed his

7

statement, but as a fact, along the entirety of the

8

southwest border, the Border Patrol stays on the border

9

and projects authority outward.

It's not the first or last line of defense.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

May I ask about an anomaly

11

created by your rule?

12

if there were a Texas State trooper who was involved in

13

the exact same conduct, that trooper, you -- you would

14

not be able to sue that trooper.

I take it everybody agrees that

15

So why is it that Bivens, which is usually

16

thought of as a more limited remedy than 1983, I mean,

17

why should you have this situation where you can sue the

18

Federal agent, but not the State agent?

MR. HILLIARD:

20

respects, except where the victim lie, this is a typical

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, my -- I -- I -- I've

3

waited while the rule was being discussed because that's

4

important; but as Justice Kagan's question indicates,

5

whether or not there can and should be a Bivens action

6

is critical to your case.

7

Since 1988, this Court has not recognized a

considerations.

We look for special

You've indicated that there's a problem

Justice Kennedy, I would say

it is an urgent matter of separation of powers, but it

would be the opposite.

20

The -- the fact pattern, if the Court may

recall, is Officer Mason had actually grabbed one of

Sergio's friends and had him by the scruff of the collar

23

next to him in the United States.

24

there would be a Bivens claim.

MR. HILLIARD:

That's what -- that's what

You start with -- you start

in your opinion that the -- that if all of the conduct

happens inside the United States and -- and there's a

close proximity cross-border shooting, then the Fourth

Amendment -- Fourth Amendment constraints on deadly

17

force apply.

18

To -- to hold otherwise, Justice Kennedy,

19

is -- is to prevent Bivens in the area of the border,

20

whether it's south or north of the line, because if

21

it -- if national security and foreign relations is

22

affected 30 feet across the line and the -- and an

officer stands in the same place and shoots Sergio's

JUSTICE BREYER:

When I write the reason for

20

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

And there's no river here anymore.

It's simply

We are responsible for

24

maintaining it, not by ourselves, but with Mexico and

25

the reason we are maintaining it is because at one time

Alderson Reporting Company

the whole river and now the line down the center are the

So this is a boundary case.

Justice Breyer's concern and inquiry, and that is, if

3

all of the conduct happens in the United States and as a

4

fact there is some exercise of control right at the

5

border, then if the injury occurs in close proximity to

6

that border, then that's a rule that would both be

workable and would take care not only of the issue with

Sergio Hernandez, but would also take care of the issue

of the entirety of the southwest border of the United

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could I ask you

16

briefly, because we haven't talked about it yet, a

17

question on the qualified immunity point.

18

It seems very odd to me that qualified

19

immunity would turn on a jurisdictional issue.

20

our cases, you're interested in the conduct of the --

21

the officer and whether that conduct was reasonable and

22

lacked a precedence, not an issue about whether or not

23

he can be sued by the particular plaintiff.

turned on -- in a -- a legal jurisdictional issue?

unreasonable if the exact same conduct and it turns out

the victim is American.

MR. ORTEGA:

I'm not aware of any qualified

I don't know of any case that

fits that fact pattern, Mr. Chief Justice.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would you recognize

10

that -- let's say it was the -- the boy that the Border

Patrol grabbed and then shot him, so the -- the -- so

12

the death would have occurred in the United States,

13

Bivens claim?

14

MR. ORTEGA:

Well, absolutely.

Then he

15

would be in the territory of the United States, and all

16

constitutional protections would apply.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So does it make a whole

18

lot of sense to say if the officer shoots somebody on

19

the U.S. side of the border, good Bivens claim?

20

officer standing in the same place shoots somebody who's

21

just across the border, no claim?

victims?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

6

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS

7
8

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

The antecedent question in this case is

10

whether this Court should create a cause of action for

11

damages under Bivens.

12

for many years, this Court has declined to extend Bivens

13

to new contexts because -- out of recognition that the

14

creation of causes of action is for Congress.

15

As Justice Kennedy pointed out,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You're quite right,

16

Mr. Kneedler, but there is a difference between this

17

case and I think -- I think all -- maybe all but one --

18

of these other cases, which is in all of these others,

19

the Court has been able to point to some alternative

20

remedy.

21

a plaintiff in a case wanted, but it was something.

22

there was an ability to say, Congress has given you some

23

way to address the harm that you've suffered.

24
25

It might not have been the complete relief that

And here, there really is nothing.

I mean,

there's the idea that you might prosecute this person

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

criminally, but what does the family get from that?

2

anyway, you almost never do.

3

So -- so here, there's just no remedy.

And

And

4

isn't that really quite different from all these other

5

Bivens cases that you referred to?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

First of all, the Court has

7

made clear in Stanley and Wilkie that the presence or

8

absence of a remedy is not the only factor, that there

9

is the additional --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, we said that, but, you

11

know, Stanley might be the only case on your side.

12

Stanley is a military case where there is like the

13

ultimate special factor.

14

time we've said no Bivens, we've said because there's an

15

alternative remedy.

16

And

So for the most part, every

And here we can't say that.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, when you say Stanley

17

and Chappell v. Wallace, ultimate special factors

18

because of the political branches' control over the

19

military.

20

have a -- a cross-border incident which necessarily

21

gives rise to foreign relations problems, which are

22

committed to the political branches.

That is directly applicable here.

Here, you

23

The -- the -- and when Congress has chosen

24

to address remedies as a statutory matter under the --

25

under the Federal Tort Claims Act, it has created an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

exception for -- for injuries occurring in foreign

2

countries.

3

And in response to Justice Ginsburg's

4

question, as a matter of Federal law, under the FTCA,

5

under this Court's Sosa decision, if the injury occurs

6

outside the United States, it is excluded from liability

7

even if the conduct occurred in -- in the United States.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the U.S. -- U.S.

liability, not the officer liability.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but I -- but I think if

11

the Court is considering whether to fashion a judicially

12

created remedy, looking to what Congress has done where

13

it has acted -- and 1983 is another very prime

14

example -- and where Congress has chosen to create

15

monetary compensation for persons injured abroad by the

16

United States, it has always done it in an

17

administrative --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why -- why -- why do

19

you use words like "create," "extend," et cetera,

20

"fashion," if, in fact, a Federal policeman, a Federal

21

agent violates the Fourth Amendment and seizes someone

22

unreasonably in Alaska, does the victim have a Bivens

23

remedy?

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but -Of course.

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, if he does

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

it in Puerto Rico, does the victim have a Bivens remedy?

2

I'll tell you by making this up, but there never has

3

been a Bivens action in Puerto Rico.

4

one.

It's the first

5

Does he have a Bivens action?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Yes, but there's -Yes.

Okay.

But there's something -Now, let's see where I've

gotten -- I'm trying to go somewhere with the question.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

But -- but there's something

12

fundamentally different about creating a Bivens remedy

13

for --

14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

I

would have thought if you want to say in there --

16

18

Well, why creating?

Or extend -Wait.

Extending.

You see,

there those words assume the answer to the question.
I can absolutely see you're saying that if

20

this Court fashions a civil remedy for a violation of

21

the Third Amendment or the Second Amendment, you would

22

be extending Bivens, but I thought Bivens made

23

absolutely clear that where a Federal agent hurts

24

someone by violating the Fourth Amendment, there is a

25

Bivens action.

Now we have an exception.

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

exception is the military.

2

So I think you can look at this either way.

3

But I think the -- the more -- I would tend to look at

4

it as saying, of course there is a Bivens remedy if

5

there is a Fourth Amendment violation unless you're in

6

the military, which no one says this is true.

7

So that's how I've been thinking about the

8

Bivens action.

9

question turns on the answer to the Fourth Amendment

10

question.

11
12

I've been thinking the answer to that

Now you can tell me why it's better to use
the words you've been using.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

The -- the Court -- just

14

because the Court has recognized a Bivens action for

15

violation of a particular constitutional provision in

16

one context or with respect to one set of defendants, it

17

doesn't mean that it should extend it.

18

word the Court has used.

19
20
21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, yes.

And that's the

In, like, Puerto

Rico?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, no, in the -- under the

22

Eighth Amendment, under -- in Carlson v. Green, the

23

Court recognized a Bivens remedy against Federal

24

employees that --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's Eighth versus

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

Fourth.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

I -I'm saying that's Fourth in

Puerto Rico.

5

MR.

KNEEDLER:

No, I'm -- I'm -- what -- my

6

point about the Eighth Amendment is that the Court

7

declined to recognize a Bivens remedy for Eighth

8

Amendment violations --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

Mr Kneedler:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Kneedler, you --- for private confirmations.
-- you get the point.

The

12

point of it is that it's the heartland of Bivens for a

13

law enforcement officer to use deadly force in violation

14

of the Fourth Amendment.

15

Bivens.

16

don't have to extend it.

17

anything.

18

That's the heartland of

We don't have to make up anything new.

We

We don't have to create

That's just Bivens.
MR. KNEEDLER:

It is the heartland of

19

Bivens' special factors analysis for the Court to create

20

a damage remedy in a situation fraught with foreign

21

relations issues.

22

point about --

23

And this ties directly into your

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

talk about that.

25

relations issues?

Well, could you say -- let's

How is this fraught with foreign
Because Mexico would surely prefer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45

that -- that its citizen have a Bivens remedy.

2

So you seem to be using foreign relations as

3

if sort of this touches some other country.

4

usual case, I think we've asked what's the interference?

5

What's the disruption?

6

or the disruption is.

So tell me what the interference

MR. KNEEDLER:

Any time --- not just the fact that it

has something to do with another country.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Any time -- any time the

14

officers of one country injure someone in another

15

country, that creates the potential for a foreign

16

relations incident and it's illustrated here by a number

17

of factors.

18

Mexico requested the extradition of -- of

19

Mesa in this case, and the United States refused because

20

it had done its own investigation of this incident and

21

concluded that the -- that prosecution should not be

22

brought --

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sure Mexico cared a lot

about this.

25

The question I'm asking is how does the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

the United States' ability to carry out its foreign

2

policy?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

And another illustration, and

4

I think -- I think it's tied to that is one of the

5

reasons is that -- why there is not a remedy in Mexico

6

is because Mexico would recognize the official immunity

7

of Officer Mesa in this circumstance according to the

8

amicus briefs.

9

That is a recognition by Mexico itself that the conduct

I have no reason to disagree with that.

10

of a -- of a U.S. officer in these circumstances

11

involves foreign sovereign problems.

12

And the -- another -- another issue here is

13

that the plaintiff here is -- plaintiffs here are

14

seeking to insert the courts into the resolution of a

15

dispute about which the United States and Mexico have

16

a -- a different view of the facts.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -- and --

But suppose -- suppose

22

U.S. citizen that was the victim of the shooting?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Suppose it had been a

We -- we think there would

24

not be a Bivens remedy there either because of the

25

extraterritorial applications.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then if it were, if

2

it were the young man who was grabbed by the Border

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, there would be.

But --

5

but in -- in terms of the questions about line drawing

6

that were raised before, the two nations have drawn a

7

line here, and this is a circumstance where this -- the

8

conduct here is clearly extraterritorial.

9

there may be joint maintenance of the culvert is a very

The fact that

10

minor factor considering that the only law that

11

governs --

12

If it -- but that's the

13

point.

14

existence of a well-recognized boundary line, this case

15

is over.

If, in fact, all that mattered were the

16

You win.
But that well-recognized boundary line was

17

present in Boumediene, and certainly Boumediene

18

suggests, while it is a factor, it is not the only

19

factor that determines the reach of the Fourth

20

Amendment.

21

because it is not the only factor.

22

So there -- there we are.

We're in court,

And now you add in all the stuff about the

23

culvert and who's playing there and who might be playing

24

there, and the 500,000 people who cross every day, and

25

the joint maintenance of the culvert, and the fact that

all this conduct happened in the United States, that's

2

what your opponent brother over there is trying to do.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Boumediene had to do with

4

the -- the substantive application of the Fourth

5

Amendment, which I want to get to in just a minute.

But the antecedent question is whether this

in 35 years.

What would the government of

Mexico say if we wrote an opinion that says because the

16

United States spent a lot of money to pave this culvert,

18

to the culvert is basically the same as the authority

19

that we have in Guantanamo.

MR. KNEEDLER:

MR. KNEEDLER:

This -- this case -- this --

Alderson Reporting Company

fundamentally different than Boumediene.

about the Fourth Amendment?

categorical rule that the Fourth Amendment does not

apply to some mass of persons outside the United States.

9

Nothing in Boumediene changes that.

Boumediene, looking at the insular cases and

Of course, I guess you

could say that with reference to Bivens acts generally,

3

even in the United States.

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, and this -- this Court,

5

in deciding whether to apply Bivens, has -- has looked

6

to the question of whether Congress is the right body to

7

decide rather than the courts.

8

And here we think it clearly is because of

9

the foreign relations implications, not to mention the

10

deeply-rooted presumption against extraterritoriality,

11

all the more so in -- in with respect to this Court's

12

creation --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As far --

-- of a cause of action.
As foreign relations are

16

concerned, at least a Justice of this Court has said

17

that the behavior of our law enforcement agents abroad

18

sends a powerful message about the rule of law to

19

individuals everywhere.

distinction that if the law enforcement agent shoots and

21

kills somebody who's on one side of the border, there is
