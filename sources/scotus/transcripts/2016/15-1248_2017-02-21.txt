the -- excuse me -- EEOC.

Ms. Ho.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. HO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The language and structure of the statutory

12

scheme, the tradition of appellate review, and the sound

13

administration of justice all counsel in favor of

14

reviewing EEOC's subpoena enforcement decisions for

15

abuse of discretion.

16

First, under the statutory scheme, the

17

EEOC's investigative authority is not plenary, like

18

other agencies, but is cabined by the statutory limit of

19

relevance to the charge under investigation, as this

20

Court said in Shell Oil.

21

Because this inquiry is extraordinarily

22

contextualized, the district court's fact-intensive

23

determination should be reviewed under a unitary

24

abuse-of-discretion standard, as this Court has held.

25

Second, the tradition of deferential

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

appellate review is robust, not only for administrative

2

subpoenas, but also for close analogs, such as search

3

warrants and grand jury subpoenas.

4

Third, the district court is the judicial

5

actor best positioned to decide the issue for any number

6

of reasons that this Court articulated in Pierce and is

7

applied in subsequent cases.

8

context-sensitive --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MS. HO:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The fact-intensive and

Pierce you --

-- natures.
Pierce you mentioned.

12

Rule 11 is another.

13

on in the district court.

14

intimately familiar with -- with the case.

15

A district -- a proceeding is going

17

about the case.

controversy.

20

a subpoena.

21

It

He knows nothing

He's not, as he -- in Pierce and in

It just -- it's an application to enforce

MS. HO:

I think, your Honor, in -- I think

22

this case shows that an action to enforce a subpoena is

23

more like those.

24

about the district court living with a case.

25

And this Court in Highmark talked

In -- in our case, the district court had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

experience, not only with the parties in the context of

2

the subpoena at issue, but also with a parallel

3

proceeding that the agency brought under the ADEA, and

4

had experience in that.

5

there are instances where the district court does live

6

with a case longer.

7

So I think this case shows that

But even if that were not so, Justice

8

Ginsburg, I think the other factors in Pierce, and Koon,

9

and Cooter & Gell, and the other cases that this Court

10

has articulated and given, put meat on the -- on the

11

Pierce factors.

12

I think perhaps the most important is the

13

fact-sensitive, context-sensitive nature which I think

14

is very much like the other inquiries that -- that Your

15

Honor --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why -- why was the

17

way with a fact sensitive, fleeting facts, multifarious

18

facts, according to Judge Watford, the pivotal issue is

19

a legal one; that is, what does relevance mean within

20

the context of the EEOC's investigatory authority?

21

treated that as a question of law.

22

scope of relevance?

23

MS. HO:

He

What -- what is the

Your Honor, I think the answer to

24

that question lies in what is, I think, critical here,

25

both with respect to the proper standard of -- of review

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

and the ultimate resolution.

2

relevance is determined not in the abstract, but in

3

relation to the charge under investigation.

4

And that is, in this case,

So the district court in this circumstance,

5

just like district courts do when they are determining

6

relevance in the Federal rules context, is looking at

7

the language of the charge in the context of the facts

8

before the district court and the universe of the

9

investigation as a whole.

And I think that's -- that's

10

likely why, Your Honor, every -- every court of appeals,

11

save the Ninth, has reviewed subpoena enforcement

12

decisions for abuse of -- of discretion, because there's

13

a close --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But they would say, if

15

it's a question of law, if the district court got the

16

law wrong, that is ipso facto an abuse of discretion

17

because he has no discretion to misapply the law.

18

MS. HO:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And I

19

believe that is one reason, perhaps the most important

20

reason, why this Court, I think most clearly in Cooter &

21

Gell, but also in Koon and other cases, embraced a

22

unitary standard of review for abuse of discretion,

23

because an abuse of discretion standard does allow a

24

reviewing court to correct errors of law and errors of

25

fact while still affording appropriate discretion to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MS. HO:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So --

-- the district court.
Can you clarify for me

4

exactly what's on appeal?

5

rulings by the district court, one on the pedigree

6

information sought -- the name, address, Social Security

7

number, et cetera, of the people who had taken the

8

strength test at issue -- and a second part, a

9

disclosure of the reasons for the termination of the

10

There are essentially two

employees who had failed the test.

11

As I read the record below, the district

12

court did not give a reason for denying the second

13

request.

14

can't under any standard of review credit a non-reason

15

for denying something, so we reverse the district court

16

on that.

17
18

And the court of appeals basically said, we

Are you challenging that particular ruling,
that reversal of that part of the request?

19

MS. HO:

Well, what the -- what the Ninth

20

Circuit did -- and thank you for the opportunity for the

21

clarification -- is it -- it reversed and it actually

22

remanded for the district court to make that

23

determination in the first instance.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
that?

And I think the --

So are you reversing

Are you -- are you appealing that part of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

remand?

2

MS. HO:

No, Your Honor.

Because we -- we

3

did not -- we did not advance an argument for

4

relevance -- or for irrelevance as -- as to -- as to

5

that.

That was an undue burden -- an undue burden --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So the only

7

thing that's at issue here is the district court's

8

failure to order the release of the pedigree, what I'm

9

calling the pedigree information.

10

MS. HO:

That's correct.

Because the Ninth

11

Circuit has already reversed and remanded at -- for the

12

district court to make a proper factfinding in the first

13

instance.

And --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MS. HO:

16

And -- and our -- our position is that one

On the second question.

On the second.

17

difference that an abuse of discretion standard makes is

18

that under an abuse of discretion standard, as opposed

19

to the de novo standard that the Ninth Circuit applied,

20

the proper course for a holding that the district court

21

did not apply the correct legal standard as the Ninth

22

Circuit held here.

23

were -- that were the case, the proper resolution is to

24

reverse and remand for the district court to either

25

clarify what it did and explain, no, that wasn't what I

We disagree.

But even if that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

was -- I was doing, I did apply the proper standard, or

2

to apply the proper standard in the first -- in the

3

first instance.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why would you remand it

5

to the district court?

6

Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit could very well say,

7

we -- we decided a question of law, the scope of what's

8

relevant.

9

de -- de novo review.

10
11

Because if it went back to the

But nothing in the rest of the opinion seems

12

to turn on that.

13

made a ruling of law.

14

Circuit, they might -- I expect they would say, we made

15

a ruling of law.

16

is the same result because the district court made an

17

error of law.

It seems that the Ninth Circuit has

18

MS. HO:

19

Honor, and we -- we don't know.

20

think it's -- it's certainly not dispositive, but I

21

think it is telling that the Ninth Circuit did not go on

22

to say, well, we would have reached the same result

23

under either standard.

24

standard that the Ninth Circuit applied, it was stepping

25

into the shoes of the district court and making a

In the footnote, I

But, again, under the de novo

2

determination of relevance in the first instance.
Our position is that even if -- under an

3

abuse of discretion standard, even if the Ninth Circuit

4

believed that the district court made an error of law,

5

the proper course under the Ninth Circuit's own

6

precedent would be to reverse and remand for the

7

district court to apply the proper legal standard in the

8

first instance.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

That, I -- I -- I'm -- I've

10

always been somewhat uncertain about that.

11

word "relevance," but a fact is relevant if its

12

existence makes the conclusion more likely than if it

13

didn't exist.

14

You used the

Now, under that standard, I guess the EEOC

15

or any other agency could require any company, no matter

16

how big or how small, to turn over everything that it's

17

ever had because they might find something in there that

18

would make a discrimination or failure to pay taxes or

19

some other thing more likely than not.

20

language, and we also find language that say of course

21

they can't authorize a fishing expedition.

22

Well, what's the right standard?

23

happens, for example, in the subpoena?

24

What is the standard?

25

So we find that

MS. HO:

Well --

Alderson Reporting Company

What

What happens?

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Anything?

They can just go

2

into your house and -- I mean, you know, absent the

3

Fourth Amendment protection -- go to a business and say,

4

we want every document you've ever had.

5

that?

6

MS. HO:

What stops

This -- what stops that, I think,

7

are two features of the statutory scheme here.

8

first feature is that the standard of relevance is not

9

free-floating.

And the

It is relevant to the charge --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MS. HO:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well --

-- under investigation --- relevant to the charge

13

that a person has already brought.

14

say, you know, we have an idea there are companies in

15

the United States that are violating -- and there

16

could -- probably are -- they are violating various

17

antidiscrimination things.

18

just go to every company in alphabetical order and

19

interview every employee.

I mean, can the EEOC

So what we want to do is

Can they do that?

20

MS. HO:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MS. HO:

No, Your Honor.
Because?

Because -- and I think what Your --

23

what Your Honor is posing is a commissioner's -- is a

24

commissioner's charge.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

MS. HO:

And the -- the EEOC has its own

2

regulations which govern what must be in a

3

commissioner's charge.

4

in the seminal Shell Oil case that this Court decided

5

and interpreted.

6
7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So there has to be enough

information --

8
9

And that was actually at issue

MS. HO:

So the language -- the language

that this Court used in Shell Oil --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MS. HO:

Well --

-- was relevant to the charge under

12

investigation and what "relevance" means in this

13

context.

14

is much more clear, but it said that it tends to shed --

15

can reasonably be expected to shed light on the charge

16

under investigation.

And I don't know that the language is -- is --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MS. HO:

19

Where does that come from?

That comes from Shell Oil.

And

that's the language that courts have -- have used.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

light on the charge under investigation.

22

MS. HO:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Reasonably expected to shed

Yes, Your Honor.
So the law is fairly clear

24

that when the EEOC asks for a piece of information, they

25

have to be able to meet that standard.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

MS. HO:

Yes, Your Honor.

And it's the

2

EEOC's burden to meet that -- to meet that standard.

3

And, again, Your Honor, I think that line -- that line

4

of questioning demonstrates how contextualized the

5

inquiry is in this context.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you briefly explain

7

what you understand to be the charge here, and why the

8

so-called pedigree information is not relevant to the

9

charge?

10

MS. HO:

11

And the charge here, we don't think -- and

Certainly, Your Honor.

12

to use the language that I was using with Justice

13

Breyer, we don't think that anything the

14

evaluation-taker knows or has experienced in this case

15

can shed light on the charge under investigation for two

16

reasons.

17

First, the evaluation itself does not mimic

18

job duties.

19

by third parties using computer modeling and Labor

20

Department job classifications.

21

It was developed, administered, and scored

And second -- and, again, I think this goes

22

to the very fact-specific nature of the examination --

23

this is an isokinetic evaluation.

24

machine, like an exercise machine, that measures

25

resistance, range of motion and speed, and it provides

Alderson Reporting Company

It's taken on a

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

resistance equal to the force that you generate.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So --

That may be so, but how

3

do you answer Judge Watford's simple point, that if

4

you're dealing with a test and in -- both men and women

5

have failed it, when you want to ask the test-taker what

6

happened after you -- you failed the test.

7

kept on the job?

8

that question to men and women.

9

the men who failed the test are sometimes kept on, but

10

all the women who failed the test are discharged, that

11

would certainly support the claim of gender-based

12

discrimination.

13

Were you

And the same question to -- to -- put

MS. HO:

If it turns out that

And, Your Honor, in this case,

14

McLane voluntarily provided all of the information with

15

respect to, at that time, the over 14,000 evaluation

16

takers.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MS. HO:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Except number one --

To the -So -- so there's no way

20

that the -- that the EEOC could contact these people and

21

ask the question that Judge Watford posed.

22
23
24
25

So you flunked the test, what happened to
you after?
MS. HO:

Your Honor, the -- the information

did include gender and it also included the -- the --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

the passing scores and the scores that did not meet the

2

requirement and whether any adverse employment action

3

took place with respect to that individual.

4

So to answer that question, Your Honor,

5

which we -- we don't disagree would be relevant, that

6

information has already been -- been provided to the

7

agency.

8

and I think this is what -- what my friend from -- from

9

the government presses on, is well, we need to talk to

So the only sort of remaining question on that,

10

them to find out whether the test serves a legitimate

11

business purpose.

12

And I would share your --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm -- I'm sorry.

I --

14

I thought I understood that you disclosed who took the

15

test, who failed it, and whether someone was later

16

terminated.

17
18

But not the reason for the termination.
MS. HO:

That's correct.

And that -- that

is the term --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MS. HO:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so --

-- termination that is back -So why isn't the reason

22

for termination relevant to the charge?

23

terminating keeps only women for failing the test, but

24

keeping men and maybe some terminating later for some

25

other reason, doesn't that show that there's a problem?

Alderson Reporting Company

If your

MS. HO:

advanced a relevance argument with respect to the

reasons for termination.

Our argument as to that is --

5

And if I may reserve the rest of my time?

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

I'll allow on rebuttal.

8

Now, where do you --

My question was where do you get the undue
burden?

But you can answer on rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

Thank you, Your Honor.

MS. KOVNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

17

Historical and functional considerations

18

strongly support an abuse of discretion standard of

19

review here.

20

considerations, if I could turn to Justice Ginsburg's

21

question about why district courts are better situated

22

to address this question even though it comes to them on

23

a largely documentary record, we think there are a

24

couple reasons.

25

And with respect to the functional

The first is that this Court indicated in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

Buford that when a district court just sees a lot more

2

of a fact-specific question, the district court is often

3

going to have more expertise in answering that question.

4

And this Court has also indicated that when

5

a determination is very case specific, the costs of

6

appellate review are unlikely to justify the benefits

7

of -- of -- are unlikely to justify the added time and

8

expense that appellate review takes because a decision

9

on case-specific facts is unlikely to yield substantial

10

benefits -- substantial guidance for future cases.

11

And we think those concerns are really

12

accentuated here under administrative subpoena

13

enforcement schemes, because a central purpose of those

14

schemes is to get a quick disposition so that the

15

investigation can move forward.

16

true under Title VII where this Court has repeatedly

17

emphasized in Shell Oil and in the University of

18

Pennsylvania case that delay frustrates the objectives

19

in the statute.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that's particularly

But, Ms. Kovner, here the

21

question whether to enforce the subpoena is the whole

22

ball of wax, right?

23

subpoena.

24

the case.

25

This is an action to enforce the

So that question is the end-all and be-all of

Are there any other contexts in which we use

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

an abuse of discretion standard for not a subsidiary or

2

an ancillary finding or, you know, a partial finding,

3

but for the finding that decides the case?

4

MS. KOVNER:

Yes, there are.

I mean, so we

5

think the most analogous context to the administer of

6

subpoena contexts is other subpoena contexts.

7

you're deciding the whole ball of wax, but the decision

8

of the district court has reviewed for abuse of

9

discretion.

10

There

So, example, this Court's decision in Nixon

11

says trial subpoenas -- pretrial subpoenas under Rule 17

12

for information duces tecum, that's reviewed abuse --

13

for abuse of discretion.

14

of appeals, you know, formally review for abuse of

15

discretion.

16

Grand jury subpoenas, courts

With respect to other types of

17

determinations, under the Fourth Amendment consent

18

decisions, whether somebody consented to a search is

19

going to be dispositive, but that's reviewed

20

deferentially for clear error.

21

With respect to abuse of discretion, courts

22

of appeals apply abuse of discretion to, as Petitioner

23

points out, venue decisions, going to be dispositive of

24

the case if there's not venue.

25

decisions that decide the case, but they're reviewed for

So there are a number of

Alderson Reporting Company

abuse of discretion.

2

As Justice Ginsburg observes, it's true that

3

legal questions may come up and may be what the actual

4

dispute is about in a subpoena enforcement case, but

5

even under an abuse of discretion standard, that piece

6

of the inquiry is going to be reviewed.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you please tell

8

me -- walk me through exactly what you think, the

9

government thinks, is what the court, district court is

10

doing when it makes a decision to enforce a subpoena?

11

What are the legal steps?

12

I'm not quite sure.

13

your -- Petitioner says there's an undue burden part of

14

this test as well.

15

because it certainly doesn't come from Morton Salt or

16

Shell Oil.

What are the factual steps?

And -- and then embodied in that is

I don't know where that comes from

17

So you tell me what you think is at issue.

18

MS. KOVNER:

Yes, Your Honor.

We think

19

there are five questions that the Court is answering

20

when it decides --

21
22
23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
you're getting that from.
MS. KOVNER:

And -- and tell me where

I mean your standard.
Yes.

Okay?

So four pieces of it come

24

from Shell Oil, and they are that the charge is valid,

25

that the information that's being sought is relevant to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

the charge, that the subpoena is not too indefinite, and

2

that there's no improper purpose.

3

Now, the Court in Shell Oil didn't mention

4

this unduly burdensome piece of the inquiry, but the

5

Court relied on the Morton Salt standard, and Morton

6

Salt suggests that that unduly burdensome inquiry

7

exists.

8

there's an unduly burdensome overlay on that as well.

9

So they are the five pieces.

10

So courts of appeals have uniformly said

We think that all five of them involve the

11

application of law to particular facts.

12

case-specific determinations that involve looking at a

13

particular charge, a particular subpoena, considering

14

the relationship between those things, and then

15

considering any submissions of that burden that a

16

company makes.

17

case-specific determinations that are particularly

18

well-suited to district courts.

19

They involve

So we think these are all the kind of

If I could turn to the second piece of the

20

case.

21

address the standard of review question and then remand.

22

But we think it's entirely appropriate here to simply

23

affirm the decision of the court of appeals, because we

24

think this is a relatively straightforward relevance

25

question where the district court just made a legal

The Court certainly has discretion to just

error in not applying the test that Justice Breyer is a

2

question of could this information shed light on the

3

charge, but instead demanding more.

4

essentially there be a necessity for the information and

5

that's just not the right legal test.

Demanding that

6

As the court of appeals indicated --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could you explain to us

8

your view of how -- how this information, the names of

9

the test-takers, would shed -- shed light on the -- the

10

charge?

11

MS. KOVNER:

Yes.

So we think there are

12

two -- two ways.

13

impact, and the second has to do with disparate

14

treatment.

15

The first has to do with disparate

May I take the second one first?
As -- as Your Honor observed, as Judge

16

Watford said, in order to figure out whether disparate

17

treatment occurred here, you need to talk to test-takers

18

and see whether male and female test-takers were treated

19

the same.

20

And if I could just clarify why the existing

21

record doesn't shed light on that.

22

page 33A of the petition appendix, what the district

23

court ordered to be turned over, and it's whether an

24

adverse employment action was taken within 60 days.

25

You can see at

Well, what we don't have is, was that action

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

termination, which is the action that occurred here, and

2

what was the reasons for the termination, and the

3

company's -- there's obviously litigation ongoing, but

4

the company says that turning that over would be an

5

undue burden.

6

with these applicants, we really do need to talk to the

7

applicants and the test-takers.

8
9

So in order to figure out what happened

JUSTICE BREYER:
don't understand.

Why?

That's the part I

I mean, it's -- there's a woman who

10

says, I took a test, physical, and I failed it.

11

And she was terminated.

12

treating women more harshly.

13

isn't a qualified reason.

Period.

She doesn't say that they are
She doesn't say that this

MS. KOVNER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

17

18

at that point, the agency doesn't just say, let's find

19

some samples, let's do a little sampling here and see

20

how this is being applied.

21

interview a few people at random and see what these

22

tests are about.

23

every single employee in the company.

24

I mean, hey.

25

Well, she's -Saying so -- you could have

Rather, they say we want to talk to

What's the basis for that on

the basis of that information?

Why isn't that an undue

1

burden?

2

MS. KOVNER:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MS. KOVNER:

Well -Yeah.

So I think there are two

5

pieces; one is, is it relevant, and the second is, is it

6

an undue burden.

7

With respect to whether it's relevant, I

8

think if you look at page 39 of our brief, this Court

9

has said time and again --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course it's always

11

relevant when anyone complains about anything to go and

12

see if really there's something suspicious going on by

13

interviewing every single employee, even if there are

14

500,000 employees.

15

not make it more likely.

16

undue burden.

17

You can't say that an answer might
That's why I was looking at

And I would think maybe you have to do

18

something before you would decide to spend -- require

19

the company to spend millions of dollars to get every

20

single employee on tape or something.

21

more than that.

22

How does -- what about that?

23

I mean, something

That -- that's what I want to know.

MS. KOVNER:

That's right.

So I think

24

whenever the information is relevant, and I think, as

25

your Honor alludes to, it's clearly relevant to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

interview other employees and see if this policy is

2

being administered the same.

3

created is that overlay of is it burdensome to the

4

company to give you that information.

5

it's pretty clear why Petitioner abandoned the argument

6

that it's an undue burden to produce the pedigree

7

information.

8

of these individuals were already in the records that

9

the company had of the tests.

The overlay that Congress

And here, I think

The names and the Social Security numbers

The company stripped out

10

that information.

11

provide us with the information to identify these people

12

by name and Social Security numbers.

It went to added burden to not

13

Additional information like addresses was

14

also already in company databases with respect to all

15

the people who were employed by the company.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So --

As you say, Counsel,

17

there is a bit of tension between your position that

18

abuse-of-discretion is the appropriate standard because

19

the district court is more familiar with the proceedings

20

and all that, and that we should make a ruling on

21

whether there was an abuse of discretion as a matter of

22

law without any intervening review.

23

MS. KOVNER:

Well, we think that in the

24

narrow class of cases where the decision rested on an

25

actual legal error, and where it's clear what the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

appropriate relevance determination is, it's

2

appropriate, then, for a court of appeals, or in this

3

case, this Court --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, relevance

5

determination is something that is pretty

6

fact-intensive.

7

MS. KOVNER:

That -- that's right.

But we

8

think that this is actually a relatively clear case for

9

the reasons that the court of appeals set out.

10

We're

seeking the basic --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

It was -- I'm left at the

12

moment -- I'll go back and read it.

13

It's simply when I read this, it struck me as I haven't

14

seen something like this where all that happened was

15

somebody come -- came in in one place and says, I took a

16

test and failed it, and then they start to interview

17

everybody in the whole company.

18

hundreds, thousands.

19

about that.

20

I just don't know.

I mean, that --

I mean, something struck me as odd

So when the district judge then said this is

21

an undue burden or they can't do it, they have to have

22

more than this, I was reluctant to say this is an abuse

23

of discretion, even though he thinks, you know, it's the

24

right thing to do.

25

for in the district courts.

I mean, that's what judges are there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

MS. KOVNER:

So -- so with respect to the

2

geographic scope, Your Honor, I think it's really

3

important that we didn't initially seek this information

4

with respect to the entire company.

5

information that was limited to information about the

6

test that was complained about at the particular

7

facility in question, in Goodyear, Arizona, where this

8

person was employed.

9

We sought

It's only when the company came in and said

10

our defense here, our explanation is we have a

11

nationwide policy, and we are using this test in all of

12

our facilities that we sought information in a broader

13

geographic scope.

14

And if we could just touch on one other

15

reason why this information is relevant.

16

respect to a disparate impact theory.

17

question under a disparate impact theory in this case is

18

likely to be is this practice justified by business

19

necessity.

20

whether this strength test, which seems to be exerting a

21

substantial disparate impact on male and female

22

employees, is actually representing the skills that you

23

need in order to -- to perform these jobs.

24

this is a strength test that doesn't correlate to the

25

work that you have to perform as an employee, then it's

It's with

The crucial

Alderson Reporting Company

Because if

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

3

that.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And interviewing

Could you say a little bit,

5

Ms. Kovner, about how it is that you're persuaded that

6

this Court did make a legal determination that was

7

affecting its judgment, as opposed to maybe using some

8

careless words, but was really making a relevancy

9

determination?

10

MS. KOVNER:

Yes, your Honor.

So I think

11

the key portion of the district court's opinion is on

12

page 29 to 30 of the petition appendix.

13

court says is, I'm not persuaded that this is relevant.

14

And the reason why I'm not persuaded this is relevant is

15

because there's an additional step that the agency could

16

take to investigate whether this charge of

17

discriminatory first, and that's to conduct a

18

statistical analysis and use statistical information to

shed light on the charge.

And why is the party's double-discretion

theory analytically impossible?

3

with regard to relevance, that the district court must

enforce the subpoena unless the EEOC is obviously wrong,

5

and the court of appeals must uphold that determination

absent an abuse of discretion, i.e., the district court

must be obviously wrong in holding that the EEOC is or

So the government says

If the district court disagrees with the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'll -- I'll look up the

4

cases, but in an evidentiary case, civil case or a

5

criminal case, the question of relevance, I suppose at

6

the end of the day, relevance is a legal matter.

7

don't we give substantial deference to the trial court

in order to administer the trial in an orderly way?

9

so don't we give substantial deference to their

10

relevance ruling?

11

inapplicable?

12

But

And how is that applicable here or

MR. KINNAIRD:

It's applicable, and it

13

supports my position about double discretion.

14

Relevance is a judgment about the

15

relationship of certain evidence to a claim.

16

because it's a judgment of relationship, there always

17

is, in the primary decision maker, some discretionary

18

judgment about how to apply the legal -- the legal

19

standard.

20

decision maker is the trial court, and therefore, its

determinations of relevance are -- are reviewed for

13

discretion belongs wholly to the EEOC.

That's different from exercising

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if the line

depends on relevance, it's exactly the same thing:

telling them whether it's relevant or not.

17

MR. KINNAIRD:

It's

Well, that's why the courts

have adopted a standard of "obviously wrong."

"Obviously wrong" is not a discretionary determination.

20

So the district court really has no discretion.

MR. KINNAIRD:

No.

The court of appeals --

as I understand it, the district court has discretion,

will rule it relevant or not, and the court of appeals

25

will say, is that an abuse of discretion, right?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Kinnaird, do you

think that your whole argument might be taking the words

"abuse of discretion" a bit too literally?

This should be -- this is about vindicating

17

appellate courts are just as capable of doing and they

have to respect discretion, because if you recognize

That's something that

I'd also like to address one point on the

It's the de novo review that applies, but rather

Alderson Reporting Company

Gates supports our position, and the reason

is that the analogue to the magistrate issuing the

subpoena is -- or issuing the warrant is the EEOC

The district court reviews the

the same deferential Gates standard to the magistrate as

10

11

review of the district courts's decision.

12

So I am aware of no -- no support, either in

13

the Fourth Amendment, I don't -- or in administrative

14

law for this idea of double discretion or double

deference.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HO

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MS. HO:

5

Let me make one point and then, Justice

6

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Sotomayor, respond to your -- your questions.

7

I heard both my friend Mr. Kinnaird and --

8

and my friend from the government make very categorical

9

absolutist statements about a case -- about cases that

10

involve testing, and the cases that involve testing

11

pedigree information will always be relevant.

12

This is a case that shows that facts matter.

13

And we don't dispute that in a case where you have a

14

test that mimics job duties or involves subjectivity,

15

perhaps talking to people would shed light on the charge

16

under investigation.

17

But in this case, this evaluation that is at

18

issue, talking to people simply can't shed light on it

19

because it doesn't mimic job duties and everyone

20

experiences the test the same way, so I think that

21

underscores the importance --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

But what the Ninth Circuit said is -- is --

4

must be responded to is, were the men and women who

5

flunk the test treated the same.

7

were discharged because of the test or for some other

Two responses to that, Your Honor.
