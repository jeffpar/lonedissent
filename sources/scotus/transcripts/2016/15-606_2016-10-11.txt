We'll hear argument

Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Roughly half the trials in this country from

11

New York to California to South Carolina are already

12

conducted under the rule we seek today:

13

requirement that judges consider evidence of racial bias

14

when it's offered to prove a violation of the Sixth

15

Amendment right to an impartial jury.

16

Mainly, a

This Court should require Colorado to follow

17

the same rule.

18

system for implementing an exception to racial bias.

19

Like every other jurisdiction across the land, Colorado

20

already has multiple exceptions to the principle of jury

21

secrecy.

22

system already in place to administer an exception for

23

racial bias.

24
25

Indeed, Colorado already has a turnkey

So all Colorado has to do is use that same

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
bias?

What about religious

Same thing in this case, except it's not, you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

know, this is how Mexicans act.

2

Catholics or Jews act, so they're obviously guilty.

3

Wouldn't that also come under your exception?

4

MR. FISHER:

It's this is how

Well, there's obviously,

5

Mr. Chief Justice, frequently an overlap between race

6

and religion.

7

viewed very similarly --

8

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All right.

that seems to be avoiding the question.

Well,

Let's say there

isn't Catholics.

11
12

And so for that reason, religion might be

MR. FISHER:

All the Court needs to decide

in this case today is race.

13

That --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I don't think

14

that's fair.

15

equal protection case; it's a Sixth Amendment case.

16

a recent invocation of race is an impermissible --

17

impermissible enough, I guess, that we will pierce the

18

jury confidentiality.

19

be religion.

20

have to have either a limiting principle that makes

21

sense, or it's going to open up a broad category of

22

cases.

23

Once we decide race -- this is not an
So

Well, the next case is going to

So whatever we say on race is going to

MR. FISHER:

I don't deny that there may be

24

subsequent cases if you decide this one in my favor.

25

But I'm saying two things to the Court.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

First of all, you can and should do what the

2

Court's done in previous situations like this, which is

3

start with race.

4

Court has said time and again, in cases like Rose v.

5

Mitchell, in cases like Ham v. South Carolina, that race

6

is different, race is unique.

And the reason why is because the

It is a unique --

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

You're not being very helpful to the Court

9
10

Suppose we start with race.

in your answers.
Suppose we start with race, and the next

11

case involves religion.

12

religion from race if we were to reach an opposite

13

conclusion in the religious case?

14

MR. FISHER:

Now, how would you distinguish

What you would do in that case,

15

Justice Alito, is conduct the same analysis you're being

16

asked to conduct here, which is look at the Tanner

17

factors and ask how effective other safeguards are at

18

rooting out --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. FISHER:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. FISHER:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Fisher, why?

Pardon me?
Why?

Why would you ask that -Why?

I mean, you know,

24

the Chief says this is not an equal protection case, but

25

the Sixth Amendment applies to the States through the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

Fourteenth Amendment; correct?

2

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I always thought the

4

most pernicious and odious discrimination in our law is

5

based on race.

6

MR. FISHER:

I agree with that.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So why is a

8

rule that says, given the exceptions we've recognized

9

since the 1800s that have said that race is the most

10

pernicious thing in our justice system, why can't we

11

limit this just to race using principles of the

12

Fourteenth Amendment as well?

13

MR. FISHER:

I'm not denying that you can.

14

And of course, the Constitution needs to be read

15

structurally.

16

So not only --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You think it's

17

odious to have the same sort of discrimination against

18

someone because he's a Muslim or practices Islamic

19

faith?

20

know, given this, I know how Muslims behave; he

21

committed this crime.

22

racial discrimination that it should be carved out?

23
24
25

You're saying, he's a Muslim.

Is that not sufficiently like

MR. FISHER:
certainly is odious.

Of course, you

It may well be, Your Honor.

And so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

What about sexual

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

orientation?

2

in the jury room about sexual orientation and how

3

particular types of people are more likely to commit

4

crimes like the one before them?

5

odious?

6

Somebody gives, you know, a bigoted speech

MR. FISHER:

Is that sufficiently

It's quite odious.

But whether

7

it would satisfy the balancing test we're setting forth

8

today would be needed to decide --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have to have an answer

10

for this reason.

11

anything but this is terrible jury misbehavior.

12

a given across the case.

13

validity of the behavior.

14

is the timing of when somebody has to object.

15

No one on the other side thinks
That's

It is not a question of the
It's invalid.

The question

And their point is they have to object

16

before the verdict comes in.

17

that rule, you will, in fact, open the door to all kinds

18

of evils which they mention.

19

argument.

20

Because if you don't have

All right?

That's their

So what we're really asking for is your

21

reply to that argument.

And it doesn't really reply to

22

say maybe you're going to have a bunch of other things

23

too, 'cause then that strengthens their argument.

24

on the other hand, maybe that's what you think.

25

the whole question is that inevitably, opening the door

Alderson Reporting Company

And
I mean,

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

to these other things, which will mean tell the jury,

2

Jury, if somebody says a racist comment, write me a

3

note, the judge says, before you reach a verdict.

4
5

Do you get the point?
question is being asked.

6

MR. FISHER:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

That's why the

I -And so that's why I, too,

would like an answer.

9

MR. FISHER:

So I think you've asked a more

10

specific question about objecting, and then the more

11

general question that we've been talking about, about

12

drawing lines.

13

So for objecting, let me just say, it's

14

impossible for the defendant to object to the misconduct

15

in this case because the defendant is not in the jury

16

room to hear it.

17

depends on the jurors themselves.

18
19

There's never been a right that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. -- please, please

concentrate on the question Justice Breyer --

20

MR. FISHER:

I'm sorry.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.

Okay.

-- has asked you, which

22

is answer his question, he's talking about the general

23

principle.

24

door.

25

simply the door is open once you rule for me, 'cause

He says everybody is afraid to open the

All right?

And to the extent that your answer is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

other bias is going to be viewed the same, it's going to

2

hurt you.

3

why that fear is not valid.

4
5

That's what Justice Breyer said.

MR. FISHER:

So tell me

I think there's two reasons

why.

6

One is you can look at the Court's cases

7

that I've described already, things like Rose v.

8

Mitchell, Ham v. South Carolina, where we have

9

race-specific rules that have never been extended beyond

10

race.

11

And the second reason is because, I know

12

this isn't, strictly speaking, an equal protection case,

13

but the same values of the Fourteenth Amendment infuse

14

the Sixth Amendment.

15

be drawn to the tiers of scrutiny.

16

And I think a helpful analogy can

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why isn't this national

17

origin?

18

But this was a case of a Mexican American.

19

doesn't it belong under national origin rather than

20

race?

21

I mean, you -- you're trying to isolate race.

MR. FISHER:

So why

Well, I think the Court's case

22

law has fused the two concepts, particularly when it

23

comes to people with Hispanic origin.

24

parties, and I think the government and everybody

25

agrees, race and ethnicity is interchangeable in this

Alderson Reporting Company

And so like the

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

case.

2
3

But if I could continue my answer about the
analogy to the tiers of scrutiny.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's not that --

Well, is it true with

5

respect to other ethnic groups, or only true with

6

respect to Hispanics?

7

MR. FISHER:

Oh, it's most true with respect

8

to Hispanics in this Court's cases, which is why we've

9

used the term "race," and every other party in court in

10

the case has used the term "race."

11
12

And I think the tiers of scrutiny provide a
helpful analogy.

13
14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can you -- you keep on being

cut off before you get to the tiers of scrutiny, but --

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- the cases where the court

17

has said that a lawyer has to be allowed to ask on voir

18

dire about bias, does that -- is that only true of

19

racial bias, or is that true of any other kind of bias

20

as well?

21

MR. FISHER:

Under this Court's cases, only

22

race.

23

have been plenty of times for that issue to percolate,

24

and I don't of any lower court decisions that --

25

And remember, Ham was decided in 1973.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think it's --

Alderson Reporting Company

So there

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

I'm sorry.

Is that -- is

that right?

4

MR. FISHER:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

And then gender.

I'm sorry?
It's just race you're

saying?

7

MR. FISHER:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

And then Batson would be race and gender; is

10

I believe so.
It's just race.

that right.

11

MR. FISHER:

12

Batson is another helpful analogy.

13

That's right.

And I think

First of all, in Batson itself, you wrote an

14

opinion about race.

15

gender came back several years later.

16

dissenters in that case.

17

from the first.

18

And of course the question of
There were three

It didn't automatically follow

And there is a different analysis that I

19

suggest you conduct here as well.

20

Tanner factors and the other factors the State has

21

pointed out, things like the composition of ordinary

22

juries look very different when you're talking about sex

23

than race.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

MR. FISHER:

You ask about the

Well, suppose --

Things like --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it so different?

2

Suppose somebody in the jury room, say it's an

3

automobile accident, says, what do you expect of women

4

drivers?

5

Every woman I know is a terrible driver.

6

what was said.

7

Women shouldn't be allowed to drive cars.

MR. FISHER:

Suppose that's

Well, you would ask the same

8

questions we're asking today, but you'd ask it through a

9

different record and a different set of balancing.

You

10

might conclude -- and I'm not going to deny this -- the

11

Court might conclude, as it did in Batson, that you

12

should extend to sex.

13

and that would be a separate case.

But you might not conclude that,

14

And -- and maybe now I can make my tiers of

15

scrutiny point, because remember, sex discrimination is

16

treated differently under the Equal Protection Clause

17

than race discrimination.

18

And under a similar analogy, it's not that

19

one is more odious than the other, or one is better, or

20

one doesn't -- one doesn't violate the amendment; it's

21

that different tools must be available to root out

22

different kinds of discrimination.

23

point of strict scrutiny is we do not leave any stones

24

unturned when it comes to race.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's the whole

It's racial bias.
Isn't it a fact that in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

the decisions of this Court, those tiers are not what

2

they once were; that is, strict scrutiny is no longer

3

fatal in fact, and for gender discrimination you must

4

have an exceedingly persuasive justification for it?

5

MR. FISHER:

Of course, Justice Ginsburg;

6

that's correct.

7

an analogy that it might use to think about the problem

8

of how to apply the Sixth Amendment to different kinds

9

of alleged bias.

10

And I'm just trying to give this Court

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

It's not just

11

alleged bias.

12

of the offensive remarks.

13

most likely to -- or a significant risk of depriving the

14

defendant of a fair trial?

15

statements that have nothing to do with race or gender

16

or sexual orientation or anything that might have a far

17

greater impact.

18

allow impeachment of the jury verdict in those cases?

19

It's bias based on innate characteristics
But the question is:

What is

And it seems to me there are

And I'm wondering why we -- we don't

Someone, I don't know, comes in and says, I

20

know that witness.

21

Believe me, you can't take anything he says.

22

that, in a certain -- in a particular case, could have a

23

greater impact.

24
25

That witness lies all the time.
I mean

So why don't we allow impeachment of the
jury processes in that case?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

MR. FISHER:

I think it's a very important

2

question that goes to the heart of the case, because I

3

think you could have also used the hypotheticals from

4

cases like McDonald v. Pless and Tanner and Warger.

5

the reason why is because the Court has said time and

6

again that race is different.

7

And

There's a difference between a bias, harmful

8

though it may be, that affects only a private litigant,

9

compared to racial bias which is a stain on the entire

10

judicial system and the integrity that it's built upon.

11

And that is the difference, the Court said, in Rose v.

12

Mitchell.

13

Ham v. South Carolina.

14

about in its Batson line of cases.

15

the system --

16
17

It's the difference, the Court said, in
It's what the Court has talked

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's that stain on

What did the -- what did

the 20 States do?

18

MR. FISHER:

Pardon me?

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. FISHER:

What did the 20 States do?

The 20 -- it's actually 18

21

States and two Federal jurisdictions.

22

jurisdictions have all limited their -- their exception

23

to race.

24
25

But those

That's what you're asking.
And remember, some of those exceptions have

been around -- in New York, it's been around since the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

'60s.

2

So we have vast experience in the States.

3

the arguments are made on the other side, which I would

4

respectfully say are all theoretical arguments about the

5

harm that would come from adopting a rule, I stress to

6

the Court, this is not a theoretical question.

7

an empirical answer that is available to the Court based

8

on the experience across the country, multiple

9

jurisdictions.

10

In Minnesota, it's been around since the '70s.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And when all

There's

Race is -- race is different

for some purposes.

12

things for Sixth Amendment purposes?

14

15

are advocating, what do you say to the defendant who --

16

the prisoner who is going to be spending the rest of his

17

life in prison as a result of the jury verdict that was

18

determined by flipping a coin?

19

But why is it different from other
What the Sixth

And if we allow the exception that you

MR. FISHER:

I think I can give you the same

20

answer I gave to the Chief Justice earlier, which is

21

that is woefully unfair.

22

balancing of the harm to -- on the one side to the

23

judicial system of the defendant against the State

24

interest, the balance is different when it comes to

25

race.

But when the Court does its

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. FISHER:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

How does that --

As bad as -How does that connect with

4

the right to an impartial jury?

5

for racial reasons.

It can be --

6

MR. FISHER:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

A jury can be partial

Right.
-- partial for some other

reason.

9

MR. FISHER:

Because the values of the

10

Fourteenth Amendment are read into the Sixth Amendment

11

as well.

12

of Bolling v. Sharpe, where the Court asked whether the

13

Due Process Clause applies to the Federal government --

14

I'm sorry -- the Equal Protection Clause applies to the

15

Federal government, which it doesn't, by its terms.

16

the Court said, you know what, the Due Process Clause in

17

the Fifth Amendment does, and that should be infused

18

with the values of the Equal Protection.

19

particular harms of racial discrimination should be read

20

into that amendment as well.

21

here.

22

And if I can give the Court an analogy, think

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

And the

That's all we're asking

Has -- has there been any

23

case, other than Bolling v. Sharpe?

24

Sharpe, the conspicuous absence was any equal protection

Alderson Reporting Company

In Bolling v.

And I

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

don't know of any case other than Bolling v. Sharpe

2

where you have that kind of reverse incorporation.

3

MR. FISHER:

4

another example would just be Ham.

5

voir dire line of cases are all due process cases.

6

There's nothing in the Due Process Clause that singles

7

out race, but this Court's opinion does.

8

that the structure of the Constitution and the unique

9

problem of race in our history and our society requires

10
11

No.

I think, Justice Ginsburg,
Remember that the

And it says

special medicine.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you think the

12

entire body of law that we have developed in connection

13

with racial discrimination or the Equal Protection

14

Clause is the issue and apply that to your case?

15

example, here, you have a very obviously offensive and

16

direct appeal to -- to race.

17

know, he's from that neighborhood; I know people from

18

that -- people from that neighborhood always commit

19

crimes like this.

20

For

What if it's, oh, you

Now, obviously, that could well be

21

challenged as based on race, or -- I mean, is that also,

22

do you impeach the jury's -- the secrecy of the jury

23

proceedings for something like that?

24
25

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think the analysis

would be similar to what you do under the Equal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

Protection Clause, but it wouldn't have to be lockstep.

2

So the question that's asked in the 20

3

jurisdictions that already do this is, would a

4

reasonable juror have understood the comments to be

5

about race?

6

understood the juror who spoke to be asking them to

7

decide the case or view the evidence based on racial

8

bias?

9
10
11
12

Would the -- would the jurors have

And remember, too, Mr. Chief Justice -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
different from the first.
MR. FISHER:

The second is very

That second -I'm sorry if I miss -- if I

13

confused the Court, but the key, when you're talking

14

about people such as from that neighborhood or whether

15

or not it would be understood as race-based comments as

16

opposed to something else.

17

So a similar question --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I like the second better

19

because what -- otherwise, you're going to have an

20

evidentiary hearing in every allegation, and 20

21

jurisdictions don't, right?

22

MR. FISHER:

Right.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There has to be a test

24

that tells you when, what's the difference between a

25

stray remark --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

MR. FISHER:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

Right.
-- and something that

has impact.

4

MR. FISHER:

Right.

And so both are

5

required, Justice Sotomayor, and I'm sorry if I was

6

confusing about that.

7

First, you asked whether or not it was

8

racial bias as opposed to some other kind of bias.

9

Second, you asked whether it went to the

10

evidence in the case and the defendant's guilt, or

11

whether it was an off-color joke made during a break or

12

something like that.

13

And let me stress two things.

One is, the

14

jurisdictions that exist already do this, and even

15

jurisdictions like Colorado already do this.

16

Go back to the first -- I think -- go back

17

to Justice Breyer's question.

18

note out five minutes before the verdict, in this case

19

or any other, describing racial bias, the judge would

20

make all the same inquiries --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

If a juror had sent a

I don't see the problem

22

there.

What -- what's actually worrying me about it, if

23

I had to write this on paper, somebody could say, well,

24

you know, on -- on request the defense attorney can get

25

an instruction, send us a note before you reach the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

jury.

That could be happen.

2
3

But you want to go beyond that and impeach
the verdict.

4

The real reason, I suspect, is even though

5

we can imagine cases that are just as unfair, flipping a

6

coin, et cetera, that part of the purpose of these

7

amendments is to create a judicial system that is seen

8

as fair beyond the individual case, and indeed, being

9

seen as fair beyond the individual case means that it is

10

more likely to be fair in other cases as well.

11

Now, if I'm really honest, I think, yeah,

12

that's probably right.

13

everything become relevant.

14

support for that?

15
16
17

MR. FISHER:

And then the history and
But have you found any

For what exactly, Justice

Breyer?
JUSTICE BREYER:

That what we're doing here

18

in creating the exception, despite the fact that we can

19

think of Justice Alito's case which is just as unfair,

20

though it doesn't involve race, is we're trying to

21

create a fairer system in general and one that will be

22

perceived as such, and there race is a special problem.

23

MR. FISHER:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Right.

So --

So I wonder if you, and --

and I -- if I could write it right, I think it would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

make sense, but I'm asking you is there support for such

2

a thing.

3

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

You almost spoke verbatim

4

out of the Rosales-Lopez opinion, which draws from the

5

Aldridge v. United States opinion in 1931.

6

principle that goes quite a ways back in the Court's

7

jurisprudence, which is the perception of fairness when

8

it comes to racial bias and racial discrimination is

9

paramount.

10

So this is a

And, Justice Breyer, if I could add

11

something -- if I could add two points about your

12

question, which we return to, about what if the jury

13

could be instructed to send a note out.

14

Well, there's two problems with that.

First

15

is, remember the jurors are always instructed, as they

16

were in this case, to use their common-sense experience

17

in the jury room, to draw on that.

18

these comments are couched, as is often the case, as

19

Juror H.C.'s personal experience that Mexican men blah,

20

blah, blah, blah, blah.

21

And remember how

And so a jury instruction at best is going

22

to be cross-cutting v. another jury instruction and not

23

always work.

24
25

And even in the much easier case of
extraneous evidence and improper influence, which are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

exceptions that Colorado recognizes, as does the Federal

2

system and everyone else, jurors are always instructed

3

not to do those things, and yet they do sometimes.

4

the system demands that we give a remedy when jurors

5

don't follow those instructions.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

What is it that the

7

proceeding that you would have, I mean, if we accept

8

your proposal and -- and interview the jurors, subject

9

them to the -- what do you -- what do you ask them?

10
11

MR. FISHER:

So there's two -- there's two

steps, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

First is a threshold showing that I

13

described earlier, that there was a statement that was

14

racially --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

are as alleged here, I guess.

17

have that in -- in the record?

18

MR. FISHER:

Okay.

But the facts

What do you do once you
What's next?

So the judge asks exactly the

19

same question the judge would ask with other kinds of

20

jury misconduct like extraneous evidence.

21

asks, is there a reasonable possibility that the verdict

22

was influenced by that bias?

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The judge

So if the other

24

jurors come in and they testify, there's testimony and

25

everybody says, yes, that's what he said, and they say,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

well, what would you -- but of course the guy was

2

guilty, no doubt about it, and the other 11 said, of

3

course he was guilty, it was very offensive what, you

4

know, HC or whatever it was said, but, of course, he was

5

guilty.

6

minutes.

7
8

Everybody -- we agreed to -- you know, in five
Does that make a difference?
MR. FISHER:

Right.

So I think you've asked

two questions there.

9

The first is, is one juror enough, and the

10

second is, do you look at the strength of the

11

government's case.

12

On the first question, whether one biased

13

juror is enough, the Court's Parker v. Gladden decision

14

in 1966 quite clearly says yes, which, of course, is in

15

line with the way you treated a multimember

16

decision-making body last term in Williams.

17

Now, the question on whether you look at the

18

strength of the government's case as to whether to grant

19

relief, I would tell this Court that's the one issue on

20

which the 20 jurisdictions across the country are

21

divided.

22

Some say the mere fact that a single

23

racially biased juror took that into account in -- in

24

issuing his verdict is enough for relief.

25

other States will look at the overall strength of the

Alderson Reporting Company

And some

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

government's case.

2

Court need not resolve that here in this case and could

3

come out on that question however it wished.

4

For, I think, obvious reasons, the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

specifically what happens next?

6

question.

7

MR. FISHER:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Right.

But you -- and

The Chief asked the

So -- so -Do you have to poll -- do

all the jurors have to come back and each one testify?

10

First of all, did HC say what the two jurors said he

11

said?

12

any of them were influenced by it.

13

MR. FISHER:

14

There may be doubt about that.

And then whether

So -- so there's two questions,

Justice Ginsburg.

15

The first one is, what does the evidence

16

show, and so some juror testimony is required to bring

17

out who said what and in what context.

18

determined, the judge asks whether there's a reasonable

19

probability that the verdict was infected by racial

20

bias, and that question, Justice Ginsburg, is purely

21

objective.

22

Once that's

It's very much like what courts do every day

23

when there's a bad jury instruction.

24

all the jurors in and have them testify how they -- how

25

they interpreted the jury instruction and the like.

Alderson Reporting Company

They don't bring

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

They ask an objective test, saying with those improper

2

statements brought into the jury room, would the juror

3

have -- the reasonable probability the juror would have

4

erred in the way they decided.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So the idea would be the

6

judge would say, we'll look at all this other evidence

7

v. the defendant.

8

him guilty regardless.

9

I think that they would have found

MR. FISHER:

No, that -- well, that's the

10

issue I was talking about with the Chief Justice on

11

which courts are divided.

12
13

We think the Court might hold in a future
case that it's enough to have a racially biased juror --

14
15

JUSTICE KAGAN:
structural error.

16
17

But that would be a kind of

MR. FISHER:

That would be a question the

Court would ask.

18

What I meant when I said, look at the other

19

facts, I meant the context in which a statement was made

20

during deliberations.

21

something and then somebody immediately spoke up and

22

corrected that person.

23

meant.

24

do every day in jurisdictions across the country, would

25

hear this evidence and decide, oh, this jury wasn't

So it might be that somebody said

They said, oh, that's not what I

I meant something else.

And the judge, as they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1
2

actually -JUSTICE ALITO:

But here we have -- in this

3

case, we have a very blatant statement, but let's

4

consider the standard that now applies on a lot of

5

college campuses as to statements that are considered by

6

some people to be racist.

7

What would happen if one of the jurors has

8

the sensibility of a lot of current college students,

9

and thinks that one of the -- something that's said in

10

the jury room that falls into one of those categories

11

was a racious -- was a racial comment?

12
13
14

MR. FISHER:

We're talking here, Justice

Alito, only about intentional racial bias.
JUSTICE ALITO:

So --

Even the first time a person

15

says something that is considered improper on a college

16

campus today and another juror thinks that that shows

17

intentional racial bias.

18

MR. FISHER:

No, I think, as I said, it's an

19

objective test.

20

jurisprudence, the Court hasn't --

21

Even under the Court's equal protection

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

How will the judge

22

decide -- how will the judge decide whether the

23

statement is -- is racist?

24
25

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think it's the same

analysis the judge would conduct in an equal protection

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

case, which is, is the statement asking to decide

2

directly and intentionally on its face the case based on

3

race.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

MR. FISHER:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Presumably --

That's all you need to -Presumably the judge faces

7

the same situation if a juror comes in during

8

proceedings, is that right, and then the judge has to

9

make whether this is something real or not.

10

MR. FISHER:

Precisely right, Justice Kagan,

11

or after proceedings.

12

the courthouse steps, as they were told in this case.

13

It's entirely proper to discuss the basis for your

14

verdict.

15

is how we decided the case, the judge might be asked to

16

make the exact same inquiries.

17

about the inquiry we're asking.

18

Remember, jurors can walk out to

So if that afternoon jurors are saying, this

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So there's nothing new
It's just -Does it make any

19

difference if it were not the jurors as here, but the --

20

the lawyer for the defense went around, contacted all

21

the jurors and elicited this testimony?

22

the jurors volunteering, but the lawyer questioning the

23

jurors to see if he can come up with something that

24

would gain a new trial.

25

MR. FISHER:

So it wasn't

So long as what the lawyer was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

doing comported with the local rules with respect to

2

contacting jurors, it would be the same case.

3

Minnesota, which is the one place where I think there is

4

a case about a lawyer breaking the rules in terms of

5

talking to a juror, there's a situation where it's a

6

different case than this and the judge might deny

7

relief.

In

8

If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Yarger.

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK R. YARGER

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14
15

MR. YARGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Everyone, including Petitioner, agrees that

16

the citizen jury system requires safeguards to ensure

17

full and fair debate in the jury room and prevent

18

harassment and tampering after verdicts are handed down.

19

And the juror's alleged statements in this case are no

20

doubt reprehensible, but the vital interests that the

21

no-impeachment rule serves apply just as readily here as

22

they do in other serious alleged cases of juror

23

misconduct and bias.

24
25

And Petitioner has not shown --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Yarger, let's -- let's

assume that that's true, that the State interests are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

basically the same, and also let's assume that the

2

safeguards, voir dire, don't operate particularly

3

differently.

4

All right?
So I'll just give you what -- what I think

5

is the strongest argument on Mr. Fisher's side, which is

6

that the -- that the interests in preventing unfairness

7

of this kind are much greater; that that's really the

8

difference, is the fact that verdicts based on race

9

discrimination pose a harm that verdicts based on other

10

kinds of unfairnesses, which exist in the world, and --

11

and are terrible, but still, that it's just not the same

12

kind of harm.

13

MR. YARGER:

And we certainly don't dispute

14

that racial bias is a particular problem, and a

15

particular problem under the Constitution.

16

think it's -- it's correct that other forms of bias

17

won't cause the same types of institutional harms.

18

course, this Court's recognized that in JEB versus

19

Alabama when it extended Batson to claims of gender

20

bias.

21

defendant is a Muslim or a Catholic or a Mormon or any

22

religious group would just as significantly call into

23

question --

24
25

But I don't

Of

And certainly a verdict based on the fact that a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The one question is whether

identity-based harms are different than other kinds of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

unfairnesses, as we've talked about in the Warger case,

2

for example, or the one before that.

3

And then another question is whether race --

4

racial bias is different from other identity-based bias,

5

right?

6

identity-based bias is different from like, you know,

7

the kinds of bias that we've discussed in other cases?

8
9

But -- but would you -- would you concede that

MR. YARGER:

I wouldn't concede that in this

specific context where you're dealing with an individual

10

defendant's Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury

11

and a fair trial set v. the important and vital

12

interests that the no-impeachment rule serves to allow

13

the jury to do its job.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it's true that this is a

15

Sixth Amendment case, but it seems artificial not to

16

think about the Sixth Amendment issue as informed by the

17

principles of the Equal Protection Clause.

18

principles, as we've always understood them, says that

19

there's a special kind of harm in treating people worse

20

and, I mean, and certainly, in punishing people because

21

of their race.

22

associated with particular stereotypes respecting

23

criminality, that that's about the worst thing that you

24

can do to a person, and it's also the worst thing that

25

you can suggest about the criminal justice system, that

And in those

And maybe especially because race is so

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

it allows that to happen.

2

So both of those two things, the harm to the

3

individual for being punished because of your race, and

4

the harm to society writ large.

5

think, be the -- the fact, yes, you're right the State

6

interests are exactly the same, and voir dire functions

7

pretty similarly.

8

harm.

9

And that would, I

But it's just a different kind of

MR. YARGER:

I -- I think it would be

10

difficult in the context of the Sixth Amendment in the

11

same courthouse in Colorado to tell one defendant that

12

that defendant gets to impeach the verdict because the

13

error that happened to occur during deliberations is

14

racial, whereas across the hall it was religious, or it

15

was simply the jurors disrespecting the jury system

16

enough to flip a coin.

17

And -- and that's the problem.

In all of these cases in which Rule 606(b)

18

is going to apply, you're going to be putting the

19

individual defendant's Sixth Amendment right, which

20

Petitioner acknowledges can be implicated in a wide

21

range of cases, v. the interests that, Justice Kagan, I

22

think you acknowledge are weighty and important, and

23

precisely why Rule 606(b) has survived for so many

24

years.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose this were a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

capital case.

2

come and make this argument, that the person can be

3

executed despite what we know happened in the jury room?

4

Would the government of the United States

MR. YARGER:

Well, Your Honor, I think

5

the -- certainly, this isn't a capital case, and that

6

might raise different issues.

7

the briefing that are capital cases in which the --

8
9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There are cases set in

Well, it doesn't follow

from your position.
MR. YARGER:

And -- and it does.

And our

11

position is it -- it should apply there.

12

jury system is so important to be protected in these

13

other contexts, and is -- and this rule is necessary to

14

allow them to fully and fairly deliberate the issues, it

15

ought to apply in that context as well.

16

don't think that question needs to be confronted or

17

answered in this case.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If -- if the

But, again, I

Do you have any evidence

19

that in the 20 jurisdictions that permit this -- this

20

challenge that they've been overwhelmed with cases?

21
22
23
24
25

MR. YARGER:

Your Honor, there -- I think

there are two responses to that.
First of all, we -- we don't agree with that
count of jurisdictions or how it breaks down.
But second of all, Petitioner does -- does

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

point to jurisdictions in which this exception was made,

2

but he doesn't link that up with evidence that -- that

3

this is not occurring, that the harassment and the

4

effects on full and fair deliberation are not being

5

heard.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, you can't prove a

7

negative.

That's -- that's almost impossible.

So I

8

want you to tell me the positive.

9

some run-amuck sort of number of motions filed in any

Is there evidence of

10

particular case based on racial discrimination, rampant

11

jury harassment, any of the evils that you are

12

predicting in your brief?

13

MR. YARGER:

Well, what we do have, Your

14

Honor, is specific examples in these particular cases

15

where harassment is a very real problem, specifically

16

with respect to racial bias, where, after all 12 jurors

17

or a large number of jurors are pulled into the

18

courtroom, it's -- it's determined that the affidavit at

19

issue was manufactured by the attorney, and that the

20

allegations were -- were untrue.

21

is the Greer case from Massachusetts.

22

And an example to give

The other thing I'd say is that the Iowa

23

rule, the most permissible version of the no-impeachment

24

rule, certainly was on the table in 1975 when this Court

25

and Congress considered adopting Rule 606(b).

Alderson Reporting Company

All of

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

those arguments were the same then.

2

arguments were made in Tanner and made in Warger, and

3

what Congress and this Court decided, and the vast

4

majority of states decided, was that the strict version

5

of the no-impeachment rule best balances these -- these

6

interests.

7

certainly acknowledge that.

8
9

All of those

And it's a very difficult balance.

We

But as to Petitioner's count, six states
apply that Iowa rule, and certainly, that's their

10

judgment to make.

11

exception is limited only to racial bias.

12

that acknowledge a Sixth Amendment exception, they don't

13

apply a categorical rule that allows evidence of racial

14

bias to come in, in every case in which it's alleged.

15

They apply it sort of an extreme-cases test, and most

16

often --

17

But that doesn't mean that the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In six states

Can you just clarify

18

something?

19

that in the states, whether the -- his number of 20,

20

yours of six, is right, that this is limited to race.

21

So it would not be applied to gender, sexual

22

orientation, and apparently, national origin other than

23

Hispanic.

24
25

This -- I think Mr. Fisher told -- told us

MR. YARGER:

Justice Ginsburg, that -- that

is true, that the cases that we've seen do only deal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

with racial bias.

2

other types of bias, religious bias v. Jews and Muslims.

3

And certainly, I think, those courts would have a hard

4

time not extending whatever particular rule they've

5

adopted to those settings.

6

that -- that to date, the exceptions have been racial

7

bias.

8
9

But we've seen extreme instances of

But, yes, we do acknowledge

In those jurisdictions, the six
jurisdictions that adopt the extreme-cases rule, though,

10

even when there is a very disturbing statement and

11

surfaces post trial, the courts still say, well, the

12

importance of the no-impeachment rule still applies

13

here, and we're not going to create an exception.

14

of course, that's exactly what the Seventh Circuit did.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And,

What -- what exception

16

would you recognize?

17

said -- qualified 606(b)'s -- predecessors in 606(b).

18

Wagner said it:

19

we would not apply this rule.

20
21
22

As far back as Reed we have

There might be a case so extreme that

If race is not so extreme, what, in your
judgment, would be?
MR. YARGER:

Your Honor, I think the line

23

that -- that can be drawn consistent with that footnote

24

would be whether or not the other safeguards that are

25

necessary to assure a fair trial were made available in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

that particular case.

2

in which voir dire on race or religious bias was not

3

made available.

4

evidence surfaced post-trial that that kind of

5

misconduct influenced the deliberations, an exception

6

might be necessary.

7

hint that bias crept in to the jury deliberations and

8

didn't do anything about it.

9

situation in which the no-impeachment rule should yield.

10

So, for example, there are cases

That would be a case in which, if

The same, if a court was given some

That would be possibly a

But it's -- if we're focused on that balance between --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, right now, we

12

don't permit or require questioning on bias except for

13

race in voir dire, so where does your exception work?

14

MR. YARGER:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

in.

Well, it -Because things do creep

We don't make exceptions for those things.

MR. YARGER:

Well, I think that's precisely

right.

in voir dire to be the mechanism through which we

20

explore all of these biases.

21

taken advantage of when it could have been taken

advantage of in this case and the trial court --

23

We don't make exceptions, and we expect counsel

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem is it

assumes that if the question is asked that every juror

is going to be truthful.

rare than common that when a question is asked is anyone

3

biased that most jurors won't raise their hand.

4

MR. YARGER:

But, you know, it is more

And, Your Honor, I think the

5

same challenges arises with regard to nearly any bias

6

that is crucial to a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights,

7

which is precisely why the practice guides the defendant

8

himself cites or Petitioner himself cites say, asking

9

the general question is generally not the best way to

10

expose those types of biases during voir dire.

11

here, not even the general question was asked about the

12

race of the defendant in this case.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

But what other types

14

of questions would -- what types of questions would you

15

propound if you were trying to elicit whether there was

16

bias on the part of a prospective juror?

17

MR. YARGER:

I would propound the same types

18

of questions that Petitioner's counsel used below as to

19

other issues:

20

whether they believe racial issues still persist in this

21

country, and what their attitudes are.

22

People's experiences on the subject,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there are -- isn't it

23

so that many lawyers won't ask that question even if

24

they could?

25

putting race in the minds of the jurors, and you'd

Because just by asking the question, you're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

rather not do that.

2

MR. YARGER:

That's certainly the argument

3

the Petitioner makes here.

4

shown is that a careful and mature voir dire on race is

5

not likely to infuse racism into jurors.

In fact, quite

6

the opposite has been observed to happen.

When jurors

7

are respectfully confronted with racial issues at the

8

outset of a trial, they tend to counter any racial bias,

9

whether explicit or implicit, that might come up during

10

the thought process.

11
12

But what experience has

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How do you know

that?

13

MR. YARGER:

That's the research that we

14

cited for Professor Sommers in the briefing.

15

have looked at that research.

16

Massachusetts, they said precisely the same thing.

17

dire is a good time and a good mechanism to raise these

18

issues to ensure that they don't --

19

Courts

The McCowen case from

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Voir

Well, that's one of

the --

21

MR. YARGER:

-- crop up.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's one of

23

the problems here.

It may be a good time to alert

24

people who have this bias not to talk about it.

25

seems to me that's a very hard thing to measure, this

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

sort of bias.

2

whether impeaching the verdict in this way will cause

3

people with biases like that to keep quiet about it and

4

yet still have the same sort of pernicious effect on the

5

verdict.

6

And, I mean, one question, I guess, is

MR. YARGER:

Well, and that's one of our

7

concerns, Mr. Chief Justice.

And Petitioner

8

acknowledges, I think it's page 16 of his reply brief,

9

that allowing this type of inquiry only on issues of

10

racial bias might, in fact, drive racial bias

11

underground.

12

Now, he says that's unlikely.

The Florida

13

Supreme Court said it might happen.

14

and it strikes Colorado that if the effect of a

15

racial-bias-only exception to the no-impeachment rule

16

drives racism underground where it can't be confronted

17

and can't be reported to the judge, the balance that

18

Colorado strikes by not carving out subject matter

19

exceptions to the no-impeachment rule is a good one.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it strikes us

Well, why?

Isn't -- you

21

know, there's a lot of talk about political correctness

22

or not.

23

and others think it's a positive thing.

24

individual is harboring racial bias, isn't it better to

25

harbor it than infect everyone else's deliberations on

And some people think it's a negative thing,

Alderson Reporting Company

But if an

the basis of it?

2

I mean, if you're not saying every Mexican

3

commits this kind of crime, but you're forced to argue

4

the evidence to convince your jurors, isn't that exactly

5

what we want?

6

and not deliberations on someone's stereotypes and

7

feelings about the race of a defendant?

8
9
10
11
12

Don't we want deliberations on evidence

MR. YARGER:

That is absolutely what we

want.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why shouldn't we try

to drive it underground?
MR. YARGER:

Well, Your Honor, with respect,

13

I think that if the juror harbors that bias and is on

14

the jury, that's going to influence the verdict one way

15

or the other.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. YARGER:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do jurors --

I don't think it's -Do jurors even know about

19

the existence of a -- a de la rel rule -- rule -- I

20

mean, that jurors can't impeach their verdict?

21

MR. YARGER:

Justice Ginsburg, what jurors

22

do know when they enter the deliberation room is that

23

that's a secret proceeding.

24

leave that they can talk to people as much or as little

25

as they want about what goes on in the jury room.

And they're told after they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

So calling them back in and calling multiple

2

jurors back in to take the stand under penalty of

3

perjury and cross-examination to be examined about what

4

was said during those deliberations will have a

5

significant effect on the deliberative climate in the

6

jury room.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you please tell me,

8

just as a matter of what goes on in the bar in your

9

State, in Colorado, particularly, I take it that in

10

civil cases, lawyers who may be trying a similar case

11

all the time questioned jurors after the fact, after the

12

verdict, in order to see how to improve their arguments,

13

et cetera, et cetera, in civil and criminal cases.

14

this a problem generally?

15

And a related question:

Is

Are there articles

16

and statistics about the prevalence of this and whether

17

or not this is disruptive to the legal system?

18

MR. YARGER:

The specific post-trial sort of

19

conversation between counsel and jurors?

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

MR. YARGER:

Yes.

I haven't seen anything like

22

that.

That is a common practice in the State of

23

Colorado.

24

lawyer in every case is going to present evidence of

25

alleged bias as if it were volunteered to that attorney.

But one concern is that, certainly, a skilled

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

And it's only after actually inquiring of the jurors,

2

putting multiple jurors on the stand to get to the

3

bottom of those allegations of what was said, when it

4

was said, and what it was meant in context, will we get

5

to whether this actually exposed racial bias on the part

6

of a juror or whether it was something else.

7

And by that point, you have done exactly

8

what Rule 606(b) seeks to prevent courts from doing in

9

order to create the atmosphere of full and fair debate

10

in the jury room.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, when this rule was

12

first pronounced, they were thinking about quotient

13

verdicts, coin-flipping, perhaps.

14

didn't figure in back in England when this rule was

15

first articulated.

16

MR. YARGER:

And identity bias

Certainly, that might be true

17

at the time the common law rule was announced.

But

18

Rule 606(b) was debated and adopted in the 1970s

19

recently.

20

decided to draw lines within the rule based on the

21

subject matter of the misconduct of the juror.

And since that time, no rule maker has

22

And I think that reflects the tension that

23

we were talking about earlier, which is it doesn't

24

matter what kind of bias arises in the course of

25

proceedings.

All of it has significant Sixth Amendment

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

concerns for individual defendants.

2

right lines only as to racial bias, but to no other type

3

of misconduct, would disserve the rule and wouldn't give

4

an adequate reason not to draw further lines down the

5

road.

6

constitutionalization of the most permissive form of the

7

rule, the Iowa rule, which this Court and Congress and

8

the vast majority of States have rejected.

And I think that would lead to the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER

14

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

15

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

16
17
18

MS. KOVNER:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Racial bias is a real problem that the

19

United States is committed to eradicating.

20

are ways to address that problem without undermining

21

structural protections of the jury system that have

22

withstood legal challenges for hundreds of years.

23

But there

I take Petitioner's principal submission

24

here to be that a different rule should apply under the

25

Sixth Amendment when a particular form of bias is at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

issue.

2

how that's really without foundation in this Court's

3

cases.

4

And I just want to take a moment to underscore

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Kovner, and it seems

5

there are two lines of cases which -- in which we've

6

recognized that racial bias in a jury room is an

7

especially important problem, and that there need to be

8

special rules to address that problem.

9

And the first line of cases is the ones that

10

on voir dire say that a lawyer who wants to ask about

11

racial bias on voir dire has to be able to ask about

12

racial bias, and that we've applied to nothing else

13

except for racial bias.

14

And the second is the Batson line of cases

15

where we've said we're going to prevent lawyers from

16

doing what we otherwise allow them to do when striking

17

jurors will lead to -- may lead to race bias in the jury

18

room.

19

Now, here, we have like a screaming race

20

bias in the jury room.

We have the best smoking-gun

21

evidence you're ever going to see about race bias in the

22

jury room, and notwithstanding that in these two lines

23

of cases we've said there need to be special rules to

24

address this prevalent and toxic problem in our criminal

25

justice system, here, we're not going to do that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1
2
3

And the question is, why would this category
of cases be different from those other two?
MS. KOVNER:

So, Your Honor, we think this

4

Court has never treated some Sixth Amendment violations

5

as more serious than others, and to talk about these two

6

lines of cases that Your Honor raises.

7

If Your Honor looks at what, I think, the

8

Court was doing in the voir dire cases, race was the

9

particular issue that it confronted there, but it was

10

indicating -- and I think it's indicated in other cases,

11

you have to conduct the kind of voir dire that's

12

reasonably calculated to detect the biases that may be

13

present in a particular case.

14

So those particular kinds of case involve

15

the high risk of racial bias, and that's what why the

16

Court said voir dire on race is required there.

17

to -- to, I think, answer the question Your Honor asked

18

co-counsel, I think the Court has applied that principle

19

in other contexts.

20

And

In the capital context, the Court has

21

indicated under the Sixth Amendment you sometimes need

22

to ask questions about ability to consider mitigation

23

evidence, and lower courts have said that same principle

24

requires voir dire on other topics.

25

And then the second area Your Honor raises

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

is the equal protection area, and we think even there,

2

the Court has not distinguished among different types of

3

constitutional violations and said we're going to treat

4

some violations of the Constitution as particularly

5

serious.

6

What the Court said in those cases, we

7

think, Your Honor, is that there has to be special care

8

taken when the government acts based on race, and so

9

some conduct that wouldn't be unconstitutional at all,

10

if it were taken based on some other criteria, is

11

unconstitutional when it's taken based on race.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason I think would be

13

the Sixth Amendment says, in all criminal prosecutions

14

the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial by an

15

impartial jury.

16

I agree with you that racial comments in the

17

room can be equivalent to other comments.

18

be -- that's what I wanted to know, a prophylactic

19

aspect, that if you want impartial juries in general,

20

you have to deal with the problem of racial confidence

21

in the work of the jury.

22

from the language of the amendment, to treat race

23

specially, and we have 20 states that have done so

24

without the reasons for limitation swamping the process.

25

But there may

And that's a reason stemming

Now, that's what I understand is a textural

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

argument, and purposive, that would, in fact, allow

2

constitutional protection of the kind they're asking

3

for.

4

MS. KOVNER:

So I think when considering --

5

I think, Your Honor, when considering a prophylactic

6

approach to preventing Sixth Amendment violations, it's

7

important to consider both the cost of this rule and the

8

other alternative mechanisms that are available, because

9

those are things that the Court has traditionally

10

considered under the Sixth Amendment.

11

So turning to that with respect to race, we

12

think the prophylactic mechanisms that the Court has

13

relied on are likely to be particularly available in

14

many cases with regard to race, and to talk about,

15

first, voir dire and then the in-trial mechanisms that

16

Your Honor mentioned.

17

So in voir dire, as Justice Kagan's

18

questions alluded to, there's a -- a well-settled

19

principle, and it's the law in Colorado that you are

20

going to have the opportunity to ask these questions

21

about race.

22

thinking that's gone into how to effectively detect bias

23

with respect to race in particular.

24
25

And there's also been a lot of study and

And then Your Honor alludes to mid-trial
reporting.

Now, things can be done to strengthen that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

safeguard.

2

things that can be done about particular instructions,

3

but in general, jurors are instructed that this kind --

4

that bias, in general, is impermissible.

5

be instructed that racial bias, in particular, is

6

impermissible, and even to contact the judge.

7

I think Your Honor alluded to some of the

And they can

On the cost side of the ledger, Your Honor,

8

this Court has always recognized that there's a very

9

high danger and a fair trial danger.

If you are trying

10

to reconstruct, after the fact, jury deliberations with

11

a sort of he said/she said about what was said, that

12

that can really undermine confidence in the jury system.

13

And we think that that risk may be particularly acute

14

when you're talking about a very sensitive allegation

15

like that racial bias occurred.

16

And I think we know, as time goes on, that

17

racial bias can be expressed in subtle ways, and

18

particularly after a jury verdict is rendered and

19

somebody goes back into the community where a sensitive

20

issue has been debated, and they're trying to recall

21

what was said, there's the real risk that there will be

22

these kinds of credibility --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So -- so the more

24

insidious the evil, the less reason we -- the more

25

caution we should have in -- in inquiring of the jury?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

MS. KOVNER:

No.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

By them?

3

MS. KOVNER:

We think that this is a

No.

We just think that the --

4

really serious issue and that it ought to be addressed

5

through the kinds of safeguards this Court has always

6

applied.

7

recognized dangers, they are present here, and so to

8

take, for instance, the danger of impeding full and fair

9

jury room deliberations, we think that's a particular

But we think that to the extent the Court has

10

risk when you're talking about this kind of very

11

allegation that contains a very high degree of social

12

opprobrium attached to it.

13

So, Your Honor, I mean, there may be cases

14

in which race is discussed in the jury room because it's

15

appropriate, because the claim involves racial bias,

16

because there's allegations surrounding police

17

misconduct in which race is often discussed.

18

different from, for example, coin flipping or

19

intoxication, where there's really never going to be any

20

reason why those things should go on.

21

And that's

This is really the kind of allegation that's

22

most likely -- that opening the door to is most likely

23

to impede full and fair debate in the jury room.

24

that's one of the --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

It does strike me, though,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

that given that one of the rules is that a juror can,

2

during deliberations, say something appropriate --

3

something inappropriate is happening here, to the extent

4

that there is this chilling effect, and more -- why

5

doesn't that produce the exact same chilling effect?

6

MS. KOVNER:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

Yeah.

I mean, I think --

I mean, it seems like it's

such on the margins, what you're saying.

9

MS. KOVNER:

I think, you know, for hundreds

10

of years courts have treated the mid-trial context as

11

different.

12

mid-trial reporting, you're really talking about

13

something that sets off jurors' alarm bells at the time.

14

Once the trial is over, not only do you have

And I think a reason why is in that

15

other interests kick in, in finality and tampering and

16

harassment, but there's also just really the risk that

17

jurors regret their decision in the case.

18

second-guess what they did, and as a result they start

19

to misremember, or they're subject to community

20

pressures that aren't present when the trial is

21

occurring.

22

They start to

Your Honor, we're not suggesting that this

23

is not a serious issue, and even one that jurisdictions,

24

including this Court when it sits as a rulemaking body,

25

can study and consider.

It's a difficult balance.

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

what this Court has generally said with respect to rules

2

of evidence is that states have a lot of flexibility

3

on -- to adopt different approaches.

4

is a case in which the interests that the rule serves

5

are fully present, and the safeguards that the rule has

6

relied on historically are fully present, and so the

7

Court --

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And we think this

Like -- like the

government of the State of Colorado, the government of

10

the United States would make the same argument in a

11

capital case?

12

MS. KOVNER:

We think that capital cases do

13

present Eighth Amendment considerations that are not

14

present here.

15

Eighth Amendment different sets of rules apply, and

16

there may be different considerations in that context.

17

The Court has often suggested under the

But, Your Honor, we think, to the extent the

18

Court regards the rule as problematic or as one that

19

deserves further study, the appropriate way to do that

20

is as a rulemaking body, which is another way in which

21

this Court considers and continually exercises oversight

as to the rules of evidence.

In the states that allow

this kind of evidence, is it -- is it all done by

2

legislation, or by rule -- or by a rule of court?

3

has it come about by judicial decision?

4

MS. KOVNER:

I think it's a mix.

Some of

5

these jurisdictions are jurisdictions that employ,

6

basically, the Iowa rule, so they let in a lot of

7

evidence about what was said in jury deliberations.

8

They just have a broader rule.

9

Or

Some have said, under our State law we think

10

this is an exception that has to exist to the rule.

11

some of the decisions on which Petitioner relies are

12

constitutional decisions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

I'd like to make

four points, please.
First, just to pick up where that

12

conversation left off, to the extent my friends on the

13

other side are saying that in a capital case the Eighth

14

Amendment would become relevant, that's exactly the kind

15

of common-sense structural constitutional argument that

16

we're making and the other side is suggesting improper,

17

that when you look at the Sixth Amendment right to an

18

impartial jury, you also consider other elements of the

19

constitution, like the Fourteenth Amendment.

20

Secondly, with respect to the prophylactic

21

measures that the other side propounds, and specifically

22

voir dire, two points.

23

to are studies where race is already infused from -- in

24

the case from the outset.

25

South Carolina, where the defense is all about the

First is, the studies they point

Cases like Ham v.

Alderson Reporting Company

person's race.

2

voir dire is almost incumbent on deference lawyers and

3

sometimes has good effect.

4

And in those settings, questioning of

But that's not what the question really

5

before the Court today is.

If they are saying that voir

6

dire is a cure-all for this situation, what they are

7

saying is in every single criminal case, it's

8

shoplifting, whether it's white-collar crime, whether

9

it's a DUI, any case a defense lawyer is -- is really

10

required to interject race into the case from the

11

outset.

12

And so as between interjecting race into the

13

case from the outset, potentially offending jurors,

14

potentially suggesting race is relevant where it doesn't

15

exist, and our solution, which is just simply having a

16

constitutional failsafe for this once-in-a-blue-moon

17

where you have this grave problem.

18

solution actually does a lot less upheaval to the system

19

than an opinion from this Court that says voir dire is

20

the answer here.

21

We think our

Next, let me say something where we agree

22

with the other side.

I think I heard both counsel for

23

the other side say this is a balance.

24

that's what the Court's cases dictate and that's what

25

606(b) itself strikes as a balance between the interest

Alderson Reporting Company

And we agree

I would suggest to this Court, though, that

3

when you conduct that balance, where we disagree with

4

the other side -- let me use the line from the Solicitor

5

General's brief.

6

choose the lesser of two evils.

7

the lesser evil.

8

bias is a lesser evil than something like the public

9

policy considerations here.

They said the Court's duty here is to
Racial bias is never

The Court has never said that racial

And I know the Court is

10

concerned about line drawing.

11

situation like this where you announce a new rule as a

12

constitutional matter that you're wondering what cases

13

are going to come next.

14

It's obvious in -- in a

But I respectfully submit that the Court has

15

never refused to remedy intentional race discrimination

16

in the criminal justice system for fear of having to

17

address other questions down the line.

18

at the Court's cases, whether they're the Ham line of

19

cases, whether the Batson line of cases or anything

20

else, the Court will have ample tools and ample time to

21

decide down the road whether other situations are the

22

same or whether they are different.

23

And if you look

Our submission here, though, is that race is

24

unique, race is a particular poison, and that the

25

experience of the 20 jurisdictions that have this rule

shows that implementing the rule we're asking will not

2

create any significant problems with respect to the

3

State interests or the administrators --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Fisher, it's not a

5

fear of confronting issues down the road.

It's a

6

question of understanding the scope of the rule that you

are asking us to adopt.

applies to discrimination on the basis of -- of religion

And I'll give you one last

You will not tell us today whether your rule

or gender or sexual orientation or to add another one,

11

political affiliation.

12

So if the jurors -- if it came out the

13

jurors said this person is a Democrat, send him to jail,

14

that would be a different result.

15

whether the same -- whether the rule would apply in

16

those situations.

17

MR. FISHER:

You will not tell us

I think it's easy to say,

18

Justice Alito, that categories covered in the Equal

19

Protection Clause case by rational basis analysis would

20

not require the rule we're seeking today.

21

be forthright with the Court by saying I acknowledge

22

there will be other hard questions about identity, as

23

Justice Kagan put it.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Maybe you could put the

question a little bit differently, because I understand

4

why you don't want to say, well, it wouldn't apply to

this or it wouldn't apply to that.

race unique?

7

MR. FISHER:

But in what ways is

Race, this is unique in terms

8

of our history and constitutional structure and in terms

9

of the more practical considerations of rooting it out

10

with the prophylactic measures we've discussed.

11

briefing is filled with citations and examples of why

12

race is particularly hard to get at through the Tanner

13

factors as compared to even something like other kinds

14

of discrimination.

15

The

And the tiers of scrutiny analysis I think

16

is a good place for the Court to look, because it's not

17

that we're saying other forms of discrimination are okay

18

under the constitution whereas race discrimination is

19

unconstitutional.

20

We're saying that different tools need to be

21

available, more searching inquiries need to be done,

of evidence here gives way in a situation where it might
