ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART BANNER

10

We'll hear argument

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BANNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When a judgment is reversed, a person who

11

has paid money pursuant to the judgment is entitled to

12

get the money back.

13

unsurprisingly, been normal practice for centuries.

14

That's common sense, and that has,

As far as we can tell, Colorado is the first

15

State ever to adopt a rule to the contrary.

16

now, when a judgment of conviction is reversed, the

17

State keeps the defendant's money unless the defendant

18

files a separate civil action and can prove, by clear

19

and convincing evidence, that she's actually innocent.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the basis of -­

21

of the right?

22

overturned has a right to get the money back.

23

constitutional right?

24
25

In Colorado

You said the person whose conviction is

MR. BANNER:

Is it a

What kind of right is it?
It's -- it's a right under the

common law of property that's existed for centuries;
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4

that it has always been the case that a successful

2

appellant gets her money back.

3

In this case, the money was taken from

4

Shannon Nelson and Lewis Madden pursuant to criminal

5

convictions, but -­

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It has to be -- it -- it

7

has to be constitutional if Colorado says we don't want

8

to follow the common law.

9
10

MR. BANNER:

This is not the law here.
Well, but -- but here -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So -- so if it's not

11

constitutional, then -- then what's the -- what's the

12

basis for -- for your case?

13

MR. BANNER:

No.

So here, the Colorado

14

supreme court did not say that this money belongs to the

15

State of Colorado.

16

said the Exoneration Act is a good enough remedy for

17

returning the money to Nelson and Madden.

Rather, the Colorado supreme court

18

You're absolutely right, though, to say that

19

if the Colorado supreme court had said it doesn't matter

20

what process we use because it's not their property,

21

it's the State's property.

22

court had said that, then you're right.

23

be having to say -- making an argument that the

24

Constitution itself gives the money -- gives a right to

25

the money to Nelson and --

If the Colorado supreme

Then we would

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Make that argument.

2

MR. BANNER:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Make that argument.

4

MR. BANNER:

So if -- if Colorado -­

Excuse me?

Okay.

5

if the Colorado supreme court had said that this money

6

belongs to the State rather than to Nelson and Madden -­

7

Madden, that would be tantamount to charging people

8

money for the privilege of trying them unlawfully.

9

Right?

It would be the State taking money as a result

10

of a trial that has been reversed, a trial that was

11

conducted unlawfully.

12

That would -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The dissent here said

13

something quite simple, which was the only entitlement

14

to the money was the conviction.

15

MR. BANNER:

Correct.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If the conviction has

17

been voided, then what legal right does the State have

18

to retain the money?

19

MR. BANNER:

We agree with that exactly.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The Colorado supreme

21

court, on the other hand, said when you paid the money,

22

we were entitled to it.

23

disconnect there.

24
25

So where -- there's a

If they were entitled to it initially, we're
still back to the operative question of why are they
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

entitled?

What is the constitutional right for you to

2

get it back?

3

MR. BANNER:

The State was entitled to the

4

money initially because there were judgments of

5

conviction in place, judgments of conviction that

6

required the payment of the money.

7

conviction no longer exist.

8

appeal.

9

all charges.

Those judgments of

They were reversed on

Shannon Nelson was retried and was acquitted of
Lewis Madden convictions were reversed and

10

the prosecutor declined to -- to retry the case.

11

while it was the State's money while the convictions

12

existed, once those judgments of conviction cease to

13

exist, at that point it's no longer the State's money.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so

I thought your argument

15

was -- was this, but what you're saying now and a lot of

16

your brief is much more complicated, but the simple

17

argument I thought was this:

18

This was your client's money.
Okay.

It's a

19

certain amount of dollars.

It was taken away

20

from them as a result of a trial that was flawed and

21

therefore they were deprived of that property without

22

due process of law.

23

Am I right or not?

I thought that was the argument.

24

MR. BANNER:

You're right.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Now, if that is the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

argument, there are two complications that I see in your

2

briefing.

3

denied restitution for equitable reasons.

4

take that.

5
6
7

One is that you concede that they could be
Let's just

Where -- where else in the law of due
process would something like that come up?
MR. BANNER:

We -- we -- the reason why we

8

said that is that in several of -- of this Court's older

9

cases, the Court describes these refunds as equitable.

10

Now, in a -- in a garden variety -- in

11

garden variety criminal cases like this one, there would

12

be no equitable considerations that would interfere with

13

a refund of the money.

14

But there -- there are -- it's possible to

15

imagine other sorts of cases where it would.

16

for example, the Court -- as this Court mentioned, as we

17

say in the -- in the reply brief, this Court mentioned

18

an example in which an insurance case in which a

19

refund -- a full refund would provide overcompensation

20

for some reason to -- to the successful appellant, and

21

in such a case, the refund for equitable reasons would

22

have to be scaled back.

23

And so,

In an ordinary criminal case like -- like

24

ours, there's nothing like that.

Those -- those sorts

25

of equitable considerations are very, very far from -Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

from -- from a case like this one.

2

Colorado talks -­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, you know,

If that's right, and this is

4

the basic argument, it's our money by virtue of State

5

law, and once the conviction disappears, why doesn't the

6

State have to proactively return the money?

7

words, why is it even required for the person to bring

8

any kind of refund action against the State?

9

MR. BANNER:

No.

In other

The State does proactively

10

have to refund the money.

11

requirement for the successful appellant to bring -- to

12

bring an action.

13

There -- there is no

Rather, the -- what the -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So your complaint is not to

14

the nature of this action and to exactly what you have

15

to prove.

16

is vacated, the State has to put a check in the mail.

17

You're saying that as soon as the conviction

MR. BANNER:

Well, okay.

That may be a

18

little too -- a little too simple.

19

our view the -- the -- a proper procedure would be the

20

procedure that was followed in these cases, where,

21

after -- in Shannon Nelson's case, after she was

22

acquited, she filed a motion back in the original trial

23

court saying, look, I've been acquited, please give me

24

my money back.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.

So that the -- in

I guess I'm asking, if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

your theory is right, why is even that necessary?

2

your theory is right, it seems -- I mean, you know -­

3

you know, you might file a motion because the State

4

hasn't done what it's supposed to do, but it seems as

5

though the obligation on the State's part is immediately

6

to put a check in the mail.

7

MR. BANNER:
That's right.

No, that's right.

If

That's

8

right.

And so when that hadn't happened

9

after several months we filed the motions in both cases.

10

Well, the -- the other -­

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I was just -- I -- I

12

understood you in responding to Justice Alito to say

13

that the State had to give the money back because they'd

14

acquired it as a result of a flawed prosecution.

15

that right?

16

MR. BANNER:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is

Right.
Well, that's not

18

true for some of the payments.

19

docket fee.

20

depends upon whether the conviction is valid or not in

21

the normal case.

22

You know, there's a $30

In other words, that's not something that

MR. BANNER:

Well, yes.

Well, in -- in -­

23

under the -- all of these payments under Colorado law

24

are collected only from defendants who are convicted.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
Alderson Reporting Company

Including the docket

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

fee?

2

MR. BANNER:

Including the docket fee,

3

right.

None of these -- none of these -- none of these

4

fees, charges, et cetera, are the sorts of -- sort of

5

filing fees that are collected from any litigant, win or

6

lose.

7

all money that is contingent upon the existence of a

8

conviction.

There's nothing like that in this case.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

This is

The other complication that

10

I see in this make-whole argument, in other words, the

11

State took things away from you, they took property away

12

from you, and when the conviction is reversed, they have

13

to restore you to the position you were in before the

14

prosecution.

15

these fees are small in comparison with the main thing

16

that was taken away, and that was -- that was liberty.

17

Is this, the -- the restitution and all of

So if your argument is correct, why

18

shouldn't this -- what -- did -- didn't the State -- the

19

State took away your clients' liberty without due

20

process of law, so would they be automatically entitled

21

to be made whole in that respect?

22

MR. BANNER:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24

MR. BANNER:

25

No.

And the reason -­
Why not?

The reason -- I'm -- I'm

getting -- the reason for that is that while there's a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

long historical tradition of providing refunds of

2

monetary payments upon the reversal of the conviction,

3

there is no comparable tradition of providing

4

compensation for periods of lost liberty.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

That's why Colorado

passed the Exoneration Act.

7

MR. BANNER:

Exactly.

Exactly.

If there -­

8

if there already was a tradition of providing

9

compensation for lost liberty, there'd be no need for

10

statutes of exoneration -­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if tradition -- I

12

mean, if tradition like that can defeat the argument for

13

compensation for time wrongfully spent in prison, then

14

can tradition defeat the argument that you make with

15

respect to the fees and the restitution?

16

MR. BANNER:

No, because the tradition is -­

17

is the -- the normal practice for centuries has been to

18

refund monetary payments that are contingent upon a

19

judgment when that judgment -­

20
21

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. BANNER:
the opposite -- right.

24
25

So the argument

is tradition could do it if there were such a thing.

22
23

Oh, okay.

If there were such a thing, if
And so it's a -- it's a -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

But we have to look at the

tradition.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can we look at the

2

tradition again?

It seems to me for constitutional

3

reasons, not for State law reasons, that's where I'm

4

somewhat confused.

5

I mean, who -- who cares about tradition if

6

the State says X and the tradition is Y, unless there's

7

a constitutional -­

8
9

MR. BANNER:
right.

That's right.

No, no, that's right.

That's

And so -- and so tradition -­

10

tradition comes in, you know, in -- in determining what

11

process is due, courts always -- always look to

12

tradition.

13

considering what would -­

14
15

Tradition is -- is always a factor in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Getting back to the State

law for a moment.

16

MR. BANNER:

Yeah.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are -- are you saying that

18

if a State creates a right under State law, it cannot

19

unduly complicate that right by flawed procedures, under

20

our procedural due process jurisprudence?

21

MR. BANNER:

Well, I'd say it even more

22

simply than that.

I would say that when a State is

23

holding onto property that belongs to one of its

24

citizens, the State has an obligation to have a

25

procedure that is adequate for returning the property.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13

I mean, that's the -- that's the error that

2

we're complaining about in the Colorado supreme court.

Below, the supreme court said the -- the Colorado

9

following Mathews v. Eldridge, and the Colorado supreme

court determined yes, this is a good enough process for

11

returning the money to Nelson and Madden.

12

The court said the question is:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is the

The Colorado supreme

Well, then your -- I think

13

your argument has moved from the simple one I started

14

out with, which is that you're absolutely entitled to be

15

made whole, to the argument that they have to provide -­

16

that we look to tradition and we have -- we have to see

17

what sort of tradition is adequate.

18

So what would be an adequate procedure here?

19

MR. BANNER:

They -- they have to be made

20

whole -- I guess I don't think I'm saying anything

21

different from what you're saying.

22

the Due Process Clause requires is for Colorado to

23

provide a process adequate to make defendants whole when

24

their convictions -­

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm saying that what

So what is that process

after the conviction is reversed?

2

MR. BANNER:

Well, I'm simply -- simply to

3

refund the money.

4

make defendants have to prove that they're actually

5

innocent in order to get their own money back.

6

It's their money.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Colorado can't

I thought -- let's -­

7

let's take the act.

8

9

What parts of the procedure of the

MR. BANNER:

Well, the -- the requirement of

10

proving one's innocence in order to get one's own money

11

back.

12

obvious one.

That's -- that's the most -- that's the most

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It would seem to me that

14

if the State had an equitable reason, it should prove

15

it, not you.

16

MR. BANNER:

Oh, exactly.

Exactly.

And as

17

I've said, the State talks a lot in very general terms

18

about equitable principles, but the State has yet to

19

identify what equitable principle entitles to not refund

20

the money.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you think the

22

requirement to start a separate civil action comports

23

with due process?

24
25

MR. BANNER:
question.

That's -- that's a harder

So let's imagine a requirement that you have
Alderson Reporting Company

to file a separate civil action, but all you have to

2

prove is that your conviction was reversed, right?

3

it was -- if it was something that -- that ministerial,

4

maybe.

5

even there, I suppose, it would be hard to see what

6

purpose would be served by such an action when you -­

saying, it would have to be a very streamlined -- some

21

very streamlined, very easy sort of civil action.

hard to see what purpose would be served by requiring

basically to say due process requires some kind of a

kind of a hearing, so good enough.

If you look at the -- the Mathews factors

favor of finding the Exoneration Act an inadequate

remedy.

It's -- first of all, this is -- this is the

No, that's right.

And so if -­

15

looking just at the Mathews test, you're absolutely

16

right.

17

Mathews test is not the only way the Court has looked at

18

this general class of issues.

19

because no State has ever done what Colorado is doing,

20

they're -- we're -- we're trying to draw from various

21

strands of due process precedent.

Tradition would not be part of that.

But the

One strand is the

know, the cases like Honda Motor and so on that say if a

25

State takes away a procedure that has traditionally been

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

before the Exoneration Act with respect to returning -­

5
6

What did Colorado do

MR. BANNER:

Just -- just gave back the

money just like every other jurisdiction.

7

That's right.

And so the -- the novelty here is that this

8

case got to the Colorado supreme court immediately after

9

the Exoneration Act was enacted, and the Colorado

10

supreme court said, oh, now we have a statute that tells

11

how money is supposed to be refunded to exonerated

12

defendants.

13

exclusive remedy for defendants to recover the money.

14

But before -- before the Exoneration Act,

Under State law, that must be now the

15

there -- there was no statute governing this -- this

16

topic, just like in many jurisdictions.

17

as a matter of routine practice, successful appellants

got their money back.

And in -- just

Well, is that true?

I mean,

20

I still don't understand the difference between the

21

simple argument that you're required to be made whole

22

and the argument that a court could deny restitution

23

based on equitable considerations as this court has

24

said.

25

So which is your argument?

don't -- no procedure is necessary -­

3

MR. BANNER:

JUSTICE ALITO:

You

No -­
-- or that you could be

denied receiving the money back for equitable reasons?

MR. BANNER:

You automatically get it back

7

unless there is some equitable reason that you shouldn't

get it back.

9

ordinary criminal case like this one, there is no

But what I'm trying to say is in an

10

equitable reason why you shouldn't get it back and it's

11

impossible almost to conceive of an equitable reason.

12

The reason why -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what if the State says

14

that you -- that the defendant has the obligation to

15

move for a stay of the judgment of restitution when the

16

defendant takes an appeal, and if the defendant doesn't

17

do that, then the money is not refunded?

18

MR. BANNER:

Yeah.

That's -- that is

19

impossible under State law for indigent defendants to

20

seek a stay of monetary payments pending appeal for two

21

reasons.

22

One is that you have to -- to get a stay

23

pending appeal, you have to post a bond in the full

24

amount of the payment.

25

indigent defendant.

That's way out of reach for any

In fact, we talked to experienced

Colorado defense lawyers who say they have never heard

2

ever of any indigent defendant seeking a stay of

monetary payments pending appeal.

4

defendants, they couldn't -- they couldn't have done

5

that.

6

Our clients, indigent

Second, by statute, stays appear to be

7

unavailable where the money is being taken from the -­

8

appellant's inmate accounts, which is the case here.

9

even -- even if they had some sort of money outside of

10

their inmate accounts -- excuse me.

11

money had been taken from the inmate account, so -- so

12

that's the second reason why a stay would be

13

unavailable.

14

I should add -­

16

MR. BANNER:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

So

The

Should we be -­

Yeah.
Should we be

18

differentiating between some jurisdictions that don't

19

collect the money until the conviction is final and a

20

conviction that's overturned on collateral review where

21

the possibility of money having been collected may

22

exist?

23

about those two situations?

24
25

Should there be a difference in how we think

MR. BANNER:

No, because -- because whatever

the reason for the disappearance of the judgment of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

conviction, the key thing is that these are -- these

2

are -- the State's only right to this money is in the

3

judgments of conviction.

4

And so regardless -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I have a problem

5

because there are some cases in our jurisprudence -- not

6

in English jurisprudence, but certainly in American

7

jurisprudence where the payment of restitution to a

8

third party would have been good reason, an equitable

9

reason for the State not to have to return that money.

10

MR. BANNER:

Yeah.

MR. BANNER:

Let me -­
So what do we do -­

Let me -- let me say -- let me

say a word about -- about restitution in -- restitution

in the -- in the modern sense of restitution.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. BANNER:

18

I mean,

Paying the victim.

-- to victims.

Right.

Right,

right, right.

19

Restitution in -- in Colorado is -- you can

20

only have restitution pursuant to a criminal conviction.

21

Without a criminal conviction, there can be no

22

restitution.

23

no separate proof apart from the amount of restitution;

24

otherwise, it's just -- it's just part of the sentence.

25

There's no separate proceeding.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There's

What do States generally do

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

if they've collected this money, they've paid it out to

2

the victim, and then the conviction is overturned?

3

they usually leave the money with the victim and just

4

take it out of their general treasury, or do States try

5

to take it back from the victim?

6

MR. BANNER:

Do

That -- that, I do not know.

7

And the thing is there -- there are very few reported

8

cases raising the issue of refunds of restitution after

9

the reversal of a conviction.

And I think the reason it

10

must be that restitution, although -- restitution to

11

victims, although quite old in principle, really has

12

only been applied in significant amounts recently.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

But your argument is that

14

if -- let's say there's a very substantial judgment of

15

restitution and the money is paid to the victims.

16

say they're victims like the ones in this case, so

17

it's -- it's therapy -­

18

MR. BANNER:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

And then even after the judgment has become

Let's

Uh-huh.
-- for abuse.

21

final, if there is -- if -- if the defendant is given

22

relief on collateral review, the State would have to -­

23

would have to compensate the defendant for all the money

24

that was paid to the victims.

25

MR. BANNER:

That's your argument?

I -- well, I agree with all of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

that except for the word "compensate."

The State would

2

have to refund the amount of money it had taken from the

3

defendant.

4

Remember that -- that -- I mean -- and then

5

as between the State and the victims, that's between -­

6

that's -- that's between the State and the victims.

7

That's no -- there's no bearing on the -- the property

8

rights or the due process rights of the defendant.

9

Bear in mind that all the money the State

10

collects from convicted defendants, whether denominated

11

restitution or denominated anything else, all of that

12

money the State is spending on something.

13

the State isn't hiding that money under a mattress.

14

of that money, even -- even fines paid into a State's

15

general fund, the State is spending that money on

16

something.

17

The State -­

And so it's -- it's no excuse when -- to -­

18

when you -- when you owe a debt to say, oh, gees, I'm

19

sorry, I already spent the money on something else.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you don't have to

21

make that argument to prevail in this case, do you?

22

think there's -­

23

MR. BANNER:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

All

-- some severe equitable

problems with -- with the -- with the hypothetical of

3

MR. BANNER:

No, no.

You -- you

misunderstand me.

5

talking about the victim spending the money.

6

meant to be talking about the State saying, well, I'm

7

sorry, we can't -- we can't -- upon the reversal of a

8

conviction, the State saying we -- we can't refund the

9

money, sorry, we already disbursed it as restitution to

10

The State is saying -- I'm not
I'm -- I

the victims.

11

And what I'm saying is the State disburses

12

all the money it collects for one purpose or another.

That doesn't set restitution apart from anything else.

If I could reserve the balance of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
GENERAL YARGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The dispositive question in this case is

23

substantive, not procedural.

Petitioners are not

24

claiming that they've been denied an opportunity to

25

prove that they are -- that they meet the substantive
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

elements of the Colorado Exoneration Act.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Instead -­

The argument is that that

3

Act is an inappropriate procedure; that the procedure

4

set up by the Exoneration Act where they have to prove

5

themselves actually innocent is a procedure that does

6

not comport with due process.

7

GENERAL YARGER:

Justice Ginsburg, if I

8

understand Petitioners' argument appropriately, what

9

they're saying is that they shouldn't have to prove

10

actual innocence at all.

11

they are geared toward and focused on that inquiry,

12

shouldn't have to apply.

13

Petitioners are arguing is that they have a substantive

14

right to automatic compensation without having to prove

15

anything at all.

16

So those procedures, because

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it's -- it's money

12

that's conditioned on a valid conviction.

13

valid conviction goes away, it seems the most natural,

14

obvious thing in the world to say that the State's right

to that money evaporates at exactly the same moment.

16

Why isn't that true?

17

GENERAL YARGER:

And when that

6

money.

7

I'm merely just talking about whose money it

You say notwithstanding that the

I want to know why.
GENERAL YARGER:

The reason why is that -­

8

well, first of all, the Colorado supreme court described

9

this as public funds.

And that's precisely how this

10

Court and other courts have treated this when they

11

encounter the issue of sovereign immunity.

12

So, for example, United States v. Gettinger,

13

this Court held that claims like these are not

14

return-of-property type claims.

15

can be subject to sovereign immunity.

16

true, it's not property of the criminal defendant after

17

a lawful conviction has been entered and -­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They are claims that
And if that is

Could you just sort of

19

describe to me in sort of common sensical terms, you

20

know, rather than point me to a sovereign immunity case

21

or something, just in common sensical terms why is this

22

the State's money?

23

GENERAL YARGER:

It's the State's money -­

24

just as it -- just as the State lawfully incarcerated

25

these defendants -- and Petitioners don't dispute that.

The State lawfully, but erroneously, took the

That was lawful.

And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so do you have

7

any obligation to return the money at all, pursuant to

any procedures?

Could you just say once -- once you pay

10

In fact, we won't give it back to you ever.

12

GENERAL YARGER:

It's our

So long as the conviction

itself existed at the time that the money was taken, no,

14

the State does not have that obligation.

15

required to pass the Exoneration Act in order to

16

compensate criminal defendants who were erroneously but

17

not wrongfully convicted, otherwise they have to prove

18

that they meet the elements of, for example, a

19

constitutional tort; that they were wronged in some way.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Just as it was

So if you said

21

instead of the $128 for this, the $30 for -- if you said

22

everybody who is convicted owes the State $10,000 and

23

you don't -- you don't get it back if you're later -- if

24

the conviction is later overturned.

25

GENERAL YARGER:

That is the rule that this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

Court has adhered to, and that -- that is precisely the

2

implication of courts that, when deciding these claims,

3

look for waivers of sovereign immunity, because the

4

assumption is that the deprivation of both the liberty

5

and the property at the time of conviction is lawful,

6

and that the property passes into public funds.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was Mr. Banner wrong,

8

then, when he told us that before the Exoneration Act,

9

Colorado, like every other State, just gave the money

10

back?

11

GENERAL YARGER:

He is -- that is incorrect,

Your Honor.

GENERAL YARGER:

21

declined to order what -- what they describe as a refund

One example I can give -­
It's a

Now, the chief case they reply upon is
Toland v. Strohl.

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

the court there did order refunds of the fines, but in

2

that case, and as interpreted by the Colorado supreme

3

court in this case, there was specific wrongful conduct

4

that violated the Constitution on the part of the

5

justice of the peace that presided over that case.

6

So as the Colorado supreme court understands

7

it, that was a case about wrongful conduct on the part

8

of someone adjudicating the case, rather than merely an

9

erroneous conviction that requires the status quo to be

10

restored after that conviction was overturned.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you denying that

12

there were courts -- lower courts that routinely ordered

13

the refund of these monies?

have done so.

All right.

11

Breyer, Atlanta Coast Line Railroad, which is a Justice

Cardozo case from 1935, and United States v. Morgan,

13

which is a case from 1939, the Court overturned an order

14

from the district court and yet declined to provide a

refund because what the Court said is it had to remand

16

for a hearing on the merits of the substantive dispute.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm more interested in what

19

does the -- did the Colorado supreme court say, this is

20

his money, but we don't have a remedy?

21

is our money and we don't have to have a remedy?

22

did it say?

23

GENERAL YARGER:

Did it say, this
What

It said that these amounts

24

are considered public funds such that a statute is

25

required providing that courts may draw on public funds
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

to award these amounts.

So what the Colorado supreme

2

court necessarily decided was that this is not under

3

State law property of the criminal defendant.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's a

5

question, it seems to me, of -- you keep talking about

6

compensation.

7

normal equitable principles of restitution, it, in fact,

8

still is the property of the person from whom the money

9

has been taken away.

The issue is restitution.

And under

And I wonder if your -- your

10

analysis has to be adjusted when you appreciate that

11

it's not compensation.

12

State, give us some money.

13

it's State, give me my money back.

14

It's not sort of the normal

GENERAL YARGER:

Under equitable principles,

Yeah.

Justice -- or

15

Mr. Chief Justice, that is the question, is under the

historical treatment of this issue, is this

property properly considered return of money?

Suppose I take that, unless you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

That's what it says.

2

So what's your response to that?

3

GENERAL YARGER:

My response to that,

4

Justice Breyer, is I -- respectfully, I don't think

5

that's exactly what the law says.

6

if Petitioners establish a substantive due-process right

7

to this money back, we agree with them.

8

doesn't vindicate that particular substantive interest.

9

And we're not arguing that it does.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If the law says it,

Colorado law

For known -- the issue,

11

I've never known us to wonder or call it a substantive

12

due-process right to own money.

13

all have a right to own our property; correct?

14

GENERAL YARGER:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Money is property.

We

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.
So I'm a little confused

16

by what you're asking for.

They're saying it's my

17

money.

18

their money, then you need to do a procedure that

19

comports with due process; correct?

Whether I agree with that or don't, if it is

20

GENERAL YARGER:

That's correct.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

GENERAL YARGER:

And you don't deny that.

I don't deny that, no.

And

23

so the question is whether under either State law this

24

is properly considered -­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about we borrow from

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

double jeopardy?

Once the -- once the judgment is void,

2

you no longer have a basis to that property.

3

theirs.

4

The only basis you had to collect it or keep it was a

5

constitutional conviction.

6

no basis to keep the money.

7

GENERAL YARGER:

It's

They had -- it was their money to begin with.

Once it's voided, you have

And, Justice Sotomayor, I

8

think that that wouldn't necessarily explain cases like

9

Gettinger from 1927 when this Court denied that kind of

10

a remedy.

11

the Court ordered that certain forfeited property be

12

returned, but the Court said, "The Court has no

13

authority to order the United States" -- "property that

14

had been placed in the United States to refund."

15

that's the question is -­

16
17

Or ex parte Morris is another example where

JUSTICE KAGAN:
what -- I'm sorry.

So

General, can I go back to

I interrupted you midstream.

18

GENERAL YARGER:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.
That's the -- you said

20

"that's the question" as though something big was coming

21

up.

22

(Laughter.)

23

GENERAL YARGER:

I think I've, Justice

24

Kagan, probably said it before.

It's just a question of

25

whether this is treated as a return of property or a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

claim on compensation.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So you said to

3

Justice Sotomayor, you said we agree that if this were

4

their money, we would have to refund it in normal ways

5

consistent with procedural due process.

6

GENERAL YARGER:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, Justice Kagan.
Okay.

So it really all does

8

depend on whether we think it's their money or it's your

9

money.

10

GENERAL YARGER:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's -- that's correct.
So if this were your money

12

on this -- on the simple theory of, there once was a

13

conviction, it once was valid, we collected the money at

14

that time, and that makes it our money going forward

15

forever and ever, no matter what happens to the

16

conviction.

17

as the Chief Justice said, that you wouldn't have to

18

provide any remedy or any process for getting that money

19

back; right?

20

you can prove your innocence, you cannot prove your

21

innocence.

22

that.

23
24
25

If that's your theory, it's not only true,

You could just keep it and say, doesn't -­

Too bad.

It's our money.

You agree with

I think you said that to the Chief.
GENERAL YARGER:

That's correct, Justice

Kagan.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

And it would also be true, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

would think, that even if that conviction were

2

improperly gained, not just in the sense that it was

3

later vacated, but let's say it was the State's fault

4

that that conviction occurred; in other words, let's

5

say, oh, I don't know, there was a Brady violation or

6

something like that.

7

It would still be your money.

GENERAL YARGER:

Justice Kagan, in that -­

8

that actually neatly illustrates the decisions that

9

States like Colorado have to make.

Before the

10

Exoneration Act, for example, criminal defendants whose

11

convictions were overturned for error and they were

12

actually innocent had no remedy, except if they proved

13

some sort of a wrong such as the one you're describing.

14

Then they could sue for a constitutional tort.

15

a significant case from Colorado had exactly that.

16

criminal defendant sued for a Brady violation and

17

received millions of dollars in compensation.

18

In fact,
A

But what the -- the State is not required to

19

do is merely because the conviction is overturned

20

provide compensation for losses that occur attendant to

21

a conviction that is overturned.

22
23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does your -- does

your analysis -- why doesn't it apply to criminal fines?
In other words, the fine for whatever the
offense is, you know, $10,000.

In other words, it's not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

money that they paid fees along with the process.

It's

2

the end of the process.

3

$10,000 fine.

4

overturned, why don't you say, well, you know, this is

5

our money now, it's in the State treasury, you can't get

6

it back because of sovereign immunity?

7

GENERAL YARGER:

You're convicted, you pay a

Why don't -- when the conviction is

Mr. Chief Justice, two

8

points.

These -- these amounts here are -- are not

9

purely punitive, so that precise question isn't

10

presented, but our line does not depend on the

11

difference between punitive fines and payments such as

12

these and neither have past -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

doesn't depend.

15

rule to fines?

You say your line

Does that mean you could apply this

16

GENERAL YARGER:

Yes.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Really?

Are fines

18

in Colorado unredeemable once you -- once you put them

19

in the treasury?

20

GENERAL YARGER:

As we understand the

21

Colorado supreme court's decision, yes.

22

Court held in Gettinger, that was a fine that the court

23

did not repay even though the conviction was invalidated

24

for constitutional reasons and the -- and the reason the

25

court didn't order the fine repaid was because of
Alderson Reporting Company

Just as this

sovereign immunity.

2

So -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

then?

this argument.

Right.

So what happens

I mean, you -- I grant you have a tough side of
It doesn't seem very fair.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the -­

and so what they do is they fine the corporation

sovereign immunity.

14
15

And then the State says, by the way, why

If you win, we're not going to give you the
We'll assert

Now, there's something wrong with that.

I'm

trying to put my finger on it.

16

(Laughter.)

17

GENERAL YARGER:

Justice Breyer, if there's

18

something wrong with that, then there was something

19

wrong with those long -- the cases decided previously.

20

And this is -­

21
22

JUSTICE BREYER:

1832 and then they went off on a wrong track.

23

(Laughter.)

24

Maybe those cases were

I don't -- I don't know.

I have to go read them

and figure it out.

But -- but it can't be that there's

2

no point to an appeal.

3

Because we're not going to give

4

GENERAL YARGER:

Well -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now -- now, that, I stop

6

right there and then I'm asking -- I don't know what

7

your -- I have to ask him, and that's why his brief has

8

several different arguments, because it's hard to figure

9

out, but there's -- okay.

10
11

Do you want to say anything in response to
this question?

12

(Laughter.)

13

GENERAL YARGER:

14

understand what you're struggling with.

15

struggle with it as well, but the -- the law in Colorado

16

supported by decisions of this Court and others in the

17

1800s and early 1900s suggests that this is a question

18

of whether the State has decided to provide this kind of

19

compensation.

20

matter of substantive procedural -- or excuse me,

21

substantive right under the Constitution, I think you do

22

encounter very significant problems about why

23

compensation isn't awarded for the serious deprivation

24

of liberty that occurs -­

25

Justice Breyer, I
We -- we

And if the Court rules that this is a

law?

3

away from them.

4

point it ceased to be their money and it became the

5

state's money.

6

taken away pursuant to due process, and consistent with

7

due process.

This was the defendants' money and it was taken

8
9

So if -- at -- you say that at some

But then you have to show that it was

GENERAL YARGER:

Yes, and the due process

is, as -- as Petitioners admit, and they did so below in

10

their petitions for rehearing to the Colorado supreme

11

court.

12

liberty and their property comported with due process

13

because a conviction supported the imposition of costs,

14

fees, and restitution.

They said that the -- the depravations of their

15

I believe my friend Mr. Banner said it again

16

today, so that is the due process that lead to the

17

deprivation.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, how can the

19

conviction -- how -- how can the conviction have been

20

reversed if -- if they were convicted consistent with

21

due process?

22

GENERAL YARGER:

Your Honor, there were

23

errors -- there were errors in these trials, but the

24

question is whether there was process sufficient to

25

allow the conviction to attach, and certainly
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

Petitioners don't argue otherwise.

2

If there were defects sufficient enough that

3

this was a wrongful deprivation of liberty, for example,

4

like the Manuel v. City of Joliet case this Court

5

encountered.

6

due to a wrongful defect in the due process in the

7

procedures that led to that deprivation.

There would be a claim for compensation

8

But the question here, there was no wrongful

9

conduct that occurred, there was an error that occurred.

10

And the way that this Court's precedents have treated

11

that is not as a return for property but as a claim for

12

compensation.

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why should -- why

isn't it a violation of the takings clause?

15

GENERAL YARGER:

For the same -- so -­

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Private property

17

shall not be taken without just compensation.

18

for any procedure or process.

19

compensation.

20

GENERAL YARGER:

Don't ask

Just give me just

Chief Justice Roberts,

21

Mr. Chief Justice, that's why the -- the tax cases that

22

Petitioners cite don't apply here either.

23

precise issue there where there's simply no process

24

given before the taking occurs.

25

That's the

Here, the criminal process supported the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

conviction and that was an appropriate conviction at the

2

time it was entered.

3

And -- and, again, if that were true,

4

Mr. Chief Justice, it wouldn't explain why there's no

5

constitutional requirement to provide compensation for

6

the deprivation of liberty that occurs.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's -- I

8

mean, what are you going to do?

9

give them back whatever time they've spent in jail.

10

You can't -- you can't
You

just can't do it, but you can give them the money back.

11

GENERAL YARGER:

That's true, but -- but you

12

can compensate them for it and certainly for a very long

13

time the common law and other principles of -- of

14

jurisprudence have supported the notion that you can -­

15

you can either order restitution or some other

16

compensation to account for a deprivation such as a

17

deprivation of liberty.

18

And so if the rule were that this is

19

Petitioners' property and it was -- and it certainly was

20

Petitioners' liberty before it was properly, although

21

not wrongfully although erroneously taken, it's unclear

22

why Petitioners' principle wouldn't apply to the same

23

question.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Was there any -- you

know, I -- one source of the difficulty we're having, it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

seems to me, is that the Exoneration Act was addressed

2

to some -- a situation very different than what we have

3

here.

4

imprisoned for 20 years and the State felt some

5

obligation to remedy that at least in a symbolic way.

6

But in order to qualify for that you do need to show all

7

these other things.

It was addressed to, you know, someone wrongfully

8

And -- I mean, is it completely settled?

9

guess we have the decision from the Colorado supreme

I

10

court that that same act applies, and this strikes me as

11

a very different situation.

12

GENERAL YARGER:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

13

I -- I agree with you that the substantive right

14

encompassed by the Exoneration Act is very narrow, and

15

it doesn't cover the claimed right that's at issue in

16

this case, and what the Colorado supreme court told us

17

is that there is no other statutory mechanism for the

18

kind of compensation that Petitioners are seeking in

19

this case.

20
21
22
23

So I agree with you, the Exoneration Act is
very narrow and is not addressed to -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
agreeing with me.

Well, thanks for

I don't think that's what I said.

24

GENERAL YARGER:

25

(Laughter.)

Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess what I said

2

is that by its -- its -- as I understand the background

3

at least, the act was not addressed to the specific

4

situation.

5

and yet the court below has interpreted it far more

6

broadly, not narrowly but broadly, to cover a -- a very

7

different situation.

8

It was addressed to a different situation,

GENERAL YARGER:

I don't -­

9

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that's necessarily a

10

fair understanding of what the Colorado supreme court

11

was thinking of.

12

What the Colorado supreme court was thinking

13

of was where is the statutory authority to order this

14

type of refund.

15

this situation before, and so it looked and it found

16

only the Exoneration Act.

17

as a matter of substance, compensation like the kind of

18

compensation that Petitioners are seeking in this case

19

is available only on a claim of actual innocence.

20

The court hadn't really encountered

So what it concluded is that

So I'm -- I'm agreeing with you because,

21

yes, the -- the statute is that narrow, but the Colorado

22

supreme court determined that as a matter of law, this

23

is -- this is public property and there must be a -- a

24

proper claim for compensation against state funds and

25

there wasn't one in this case.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, you said a couple

2

of times that if -- if we were to look at this as this

3

is not public property once the conviction is vacated,

4

that instead it once again becomes the criminal

5

defendant's property, the acquitted defendant's

6

property, if that were true what kind of procedure would

7

you have to set up to return the property, do you think?

8
9

GENERAL YARGER:

Justice Kagan, I think it

would -- would be fairly minimal.

I think it would

10

involve, perhaps, a motion filed in the district court.

11

I think the only burden that could, perhaps, be placed

12

on a criminal defendant would be proving the amounts

13

that were, in fact, taken from the defendant, and then

14

there would have -- there could be, for example, time

15

limits put in place.

16
17
18
19
20

But if this truly is Petitioners' property,
they -- they would have to be minimal requirements.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This is what they, they

made a motion.
GENERAL YARGER:

That's correct.

So it

21

would be similar to the route that they -- they

22

attempted to take, but the courts below held that they

23

did not have authority except in the case of Madden,

24

just for the -- for the -- for the fees.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
Alderson Reporting Company

I thought you told

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

me it was not their property.

2

but even if it was, once it's in your treasury they

3

can't get it back because of sovereign immunity.

4

GENERAL YARGER:

In other words, even -­

Chief Justice Roberts -­

5

or, excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice, if this is their

6

property, if they have a present entitlement to it, it

7

is their property, then due process requires them some

8

procedure to get it back, and that's the question.

9

Is this, as a matter of substantive law,

10

their property or public funds as the Colorado supreme

11

court held, and, therefore, there's -- there can only be

12

a mechanism for compensation from public fund for those

13

losses?

And so that is the key question in this case.

If there are no further questions.

MR. BANNER:

21

couple of quick things.

22

Thank you,

Okay.

Just a couple of -- a

First of all, this -- I believe that this

23

argument is the first time in this litigation that the

24

State has come out and said, "This is -- this money

25

belongs to the State."

The Colorado supreme court did

Alderson Reporting Company

not say that.

2

The Colorado -­

JUSTICE BREYER:
either.

4

MR. BANNER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6
7

It doesn't say the opposite

It doesn't say the opposite -­
All right.

So what do we

do about that?
MR. BANNER:

But -- but -- but the -- what

8

the Colorado supreme court did was to skip over that

9

question and proceed straight to the next logical

10

question that would occur if it was -- the money was our

11

property, which is, is the Exoneration Act an adequate

12

procedure for returning it?

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because that could be

14

consistent with the money's their property, but they

15

have an obligation to give it back.

16

MR. BANNER:

Not really, because -- because

17

if it was -- if the -- if the -- if the money is the

18

State's property, then it doesn't matter.

19

have to provide any procedure to give it back; right?

20

They don't

So the -- the question with the -- that the

21

Colorado supreme court actually decided, the one

22

thing -- the issue -- I mean, the part of the decision

23

that we're attacking is that this is an adequate

24

procedure for the return of the property.

MR. BANNER:

15

Okay.

I know that's not helpful to

you.

16
17

But I haven't found that

All right.

The other -- the other -- the

other -­

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. BANNER:

The other quick point I want to

20

make is, I just want to explain very briefly why

21

sovereign immunity has never been thought to be -­

22

provide any bar to these refunds.

23

24

25

And that is, we're

The State already brought these suits

crimes; right?

2

judgment against the State.

3

4

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. BANNER:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean -­

I'm not going anywhere.
-- let's go over your case

14

that you like, the Bank of Washington v. United States,

15

1832.

And it says "the law."

16
17

MR. BANNER:

The common -­

The common -- I believe the

common law.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. BANNER:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

What law?

of.

Common.

I believe all those cases -­
That is what I am afraid

So -­

22

MR. BANNER:

-- are about the common law.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. BANNER:

25

Thank you.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.
