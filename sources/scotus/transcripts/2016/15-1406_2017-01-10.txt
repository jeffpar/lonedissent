ORAL ARGUMENT OF PIERRE H. BERGERON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BERGERON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

A direct causation standard is necessary in

11

light of the historic restrictions on a court's inherent

12

authority, and it provides courts with a workable

13

framework that they customarily apply in the sanctions

14

context.

15

direct causation standard applies, sometimes, but not

16

always. Their two-teared suggestion, however, does not

17

provide concrete guidance to the district courts and it

18

would inevitably lead to the expansion of the inherent

19

authority.

20

Respondents, in fact, acknowledge that a

One of the reasons this Court has been

21

reticent about any sort of broadening of the scope of

22

the inherent authority is because the due-process issues

23

and separation of powers issues combined with a court

24

determining the violation acting essentially as

25

prosecutor and fact finder and then imposing the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

penalty. And --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do you -- am I to

3

take that your -- I think what I read from your brief is

4

that we should draw the line that we drew in Bagli

5

between compensatory damages under the contempt inherent

6

power and punishment damages that require criminal civil

7

procedures. Is that the same thing you're asking us

8

to --

9
10

MR. BERGERON:
same thing.

11
12

Yes. That's essentially the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how do you deal with

Chambers?

13

MR. BERGERON:

14

couple of different ways.

15

factually distinguishably different from our case

16

because Chambers was based purely on pervasive

17

misconduct that was so bad that it tainted the entire

18

case because there was no -- there was no good faith

19

defense at the end of the day. We have the good faith

20

defense here.

So we deal with Chambers a
First of all, Chambers

21

But secondly --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wasn't, that wasn't that

23

what was found here was that it was pervasive from the

24

very first effort to get discovery continuing through

25

the settlement?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

MR. BERGERON:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

In

2

fact, what the Court found ultimately was it recognized

3

it did not resolve the question whether the Heat Rise

4

test was dispositive.

5

would be helpful, but it did not make a determination of

6

that.

7

as to even if the tests were produced, that there was

8

still a design defect.

9

causation defenses as to the ultimate cause of the

And it said plaintiffs believe it

And in light of that, we had good-faith defenses

And beyond that, there were also

10

accident, whether that was driver error or whether there

11

was impact damage.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But weren't you given the

13

opportunity -- maybe you can clarify this -- the -- the

14

Court said, well, if we're wrong about giving all of the

15

counsel fees, then we will deduct -- what? -- some

16

$700,000 based on Goodyear's filing of the amount that

17

should not be recovered because it was unrelated to

18

Goodyear's bad conduct.

19
20
21

MR. BERGERON:

Correct.

So there's two

points on that.
First of all, that was -- how that evolved

22

was the Court had already ruled against us on the

23

causation point; so we had lost that battle.

24

when we -- when the plaintiffs finally submitted their

25

fee application, we took a fallback position and said,

Alderson Reporting Company

And then

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

at a bare minimum, this needs to be carved out.

2

haven't waived that, but I think the second --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you represented that

4

that was the cost that was not attributable to

5

Goodyear's misconduct.

6

MR. BERGERON:

So we

What we represented was that

7

it was related to the medical costs, the medical

8

damages -- proven up the medical damages, as well as

9

pursuit of the other defendants.

So that would be one

10

subset of the -- of the costs that were not caused by

11

the misconduct, but it wasn't the total one.

12

And what's significant about that as well is

13

that the court said it's impossible to make this

14

calculation.

15

certain extent, make a calculation based on the evidence

16

that was submitted.

17

But then the court did, at least to a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, your test is

18

the direct directness of the causation.

19

guess I'm curious as to how you would apply that in

20

practice.

21

don't get the Heat Rise test, they get something else

22

that isn't as, in their view --

I mean, if you take a case, for example, they

23

MR. BERGERON:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

And I -- I

Right.

compelling.

Alderson Reporting Company

-- dramatic or

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

MR. BERGERON:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.
And they have to go

3

through all sorts of -- they're preparing somebody to

4

testify about this other test, and they incur $100,000

5

in expenses to do that.

6

directly caused by the failure to disclose the Heat Rise

7

test?

8
9

Is that something that would be

MR. BERGERON:

I think there's a couple of

different ways you can look at it.

I think we -- we --

10

we gravitate towards the Fox test, which is the

11

incremental harm.

12

litigation anyway, and you're going to engage in

13

prepping that witness anyway --

14

So if you're going to engage in that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's say

15

they're not.

16

Rise test, that's -- that's much more dramatic.

17

don't need to worry about, you know, this less

18

compelling test.

19

They say, you know, if we get the Heat

MR. BERGERON:

We

I think there certainly could

20

be situations where -- where the proponent of fees would

21

say, we would not have taken this deposition if we had

22

had this document, for instance, and then that would --

23

that could be something that they would then recover

24

for.

25

I think generally what you're looking at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

is -- is the incremental costs going above a baseline.

2

And that's --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's always a

4

guess-estimate to start with.

5

in its colloquial sense of you're -- you're looking at

6

what happened and you're cutting broadly at the lines

7

because you can never set the line precisely.

8
9

Guess-estimate, I use it

But as Justice -- as the Chief Justice said
on the Heat Rise test, there was one expert that was

10

questioned, but would have been questioned in a totally

11

different way if the proper tests had been disclosed.

12
13

Why was that causal decision by the district
court wrong?

14

MR. BERGERON:

Well, we think that they

15

could recover for that expert.

16

the district court never got into the actual analysis of

17

causation.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And, in fact, you know,

No, but they -- they --

19

the district court asked you to tell them what you

20

thought wasn't caused, assuming that you accepted the

21

district court's findings.

22

MR. BERGERON:

Well, in fairness, the

23

district court told us we -- we were not going to be

24

able to do that.

25

700,000 came up, because we took a fallback position and

And we -- that's -- that's how the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

tried to say, well, at a bare minimum, these things are

2

so far attenuated, so far removed from any misconduct,

3

that has to be removed.

4

But you need to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, to be precise about

5

that, what were you asked by the district judge to

6

submit?

7

MR. BERGERON:

So what happened was before

8

the district court issued its November 2012 order, we

9

had raised -- they -- they had requested all sorts of

10

remedies for sanctions, and we had raised the causation

11

point, the causation limitation.

12

rejected that in the November 2012 order and said, no,

13

you get everything.

14

The district court

And so in response, the plaintiffs filed a

15

three-page fee application that said give us everything,

16

along with all of their time records.

17

So then in response to that, that's where we

18

filed our opposition and said, you know, that's where we

19

raised the issue of -- of the 700,000 as being too far

20

removed.

21

But we -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So why isn't it

22

appropriate, given that the plaintiff was put to a great

23

expense and probably got less in the settlement than

24

they would have gotten if Goodyear had lived up to its

25

discovery responsibilities, why isn't it appropriate to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

say instead of making the plaintiff prove every single

2

item that's attributable to the discovery fault, it

3

should be the defendant's expert to point out what --

4

what items were not attributable?

5

MR. BERGERON:

6

practical and a legal answer to that.

7

answer is because they are the ones that incurred the

8

fees, they are in the best position to say these fees

9

were incurred as a result of the misconduct.

I think there's both a
The practical

And I

10

think if you look at all the sanction regimes, the

11

burden is on the proponent to establish the propriety of

12

the award.

13

The legal answer is that Bagwell, although

14

it doesn't squarely address this point, does seem to

15

indicate that it is the proponent that needs to

16

establish the causation link.

17

Ginsburg, your concurrence seemed to -- to echo that as

18

well.

19

said, look, we want to be apprehensive about shifting

20

the litigation burdens, admittedly in a slightly

21

different context, without legislative guidance.

22

of course, that's part of the problem here is there is

23

no legislative guidance, which is the reason that there

24

needs to be a causation check on the inherent authority.

25

And I believe, Justice

And then when you look at Alyeska, that case

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And,

Mr. Bergeron, could I go

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

back to the question that the Chief Justice asked you.

2

You said that you favored the approach of Fox v. Vice,

3

which is a but-for test.

4

MR. BERGERON:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

Right.
It's would you have incurred

this cost anyway even --

7

MR. BERGERON:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

But Fox v. Vice never uses this language of

Right.
-- without the misconduct.

10

directness, which seems to me actually much more in line

11

with proximate cause inquiries.

12

Now, Fox v. Vice, you know, never addressed

13

proximate cause either way.

14

fact pattern.

15

proximate cause fact pattern either; it just seems as

16

though it's a -- you know, should there be a but-for

17

test.

18

It wasn't a proximate cause

This actually seems not really a

So I guess I'm wondering, where does this

19

language of -- you say "but for," but you also say

20

"direct."

21

terms?

22

What do you mean when you use those two

MR. BERGERON:

We borrowed "direct" from

23

Cooter & Gell and from the other sanction regimes that

24

all have various iterations of what I call direct

25

causation.

Now, they may refer to it as direct effect;

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

they may refer to it as direct result.

2

of the day.

3

But at the end

That's what they're applying.
Now, we looked at Fox v. Vice and saw

4

essentially the same analysis, because what those cases

5

are trying to determine in -- in the other sanction

6

regimes is, what is the excess cost?

7

that slightly differently, looking at it -- calling it

8

incremental costs, calling it but-for.

9

we think the tests are synonymous.

And Fox approached

So, essentially,

And the reason that

10

it's a little bit different than, say, proximate cause

11

is because we're dealing with the American rule and --

12

and coming up with an exception to the American rule.

13

But, obviously, the exception is not -- it's not an

14

all-or-nothing claim, and obviously Fox made that --

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, suppose we say that

16

the Fox v. Vice but-for test is something along the

17

lines of what we should be applying here.

18

does -- in your reply brief, you basically say that a

19

court can "never."

20

this case it was wrong.

21

court can never say, look, the case would have settled

22

right away, and all costs ought to go to the victimized

23

party.

24
25

So how

You don't -- you don't just say in

Why is that?

In your reply brief, you say a

If it's a but-for test, why

couldn't a court on a proper set of facts say, look, if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

this -- if this abuse hadn't occurred, this case would

2

just never have gone on?

3

MR. BERGERON:

We think that that is just

4

far too speculative to satisfy a direct causation test.

5

And, obviously, in this case, it really illustrates the

6

point, because the district court said, I'm pointing to

7

Goodyear's experience in other cases.

8

cases, it went all the way to or through trial.

9

But in those

But -- but the other problem with this is --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I don't know what --

11

what -- too speculative.

12

I understand that I have to find this; you know, that

13

it's more likely than not.

14

about what costs would have been incurred anyway.

15

Would -- you know, there's never any certainty.

16

always saying more likely than not, would this cost have

17

been incurred?

18

would have been incurred if this abuse hadn't taken

19

place.

20

I mean, the Court says, look,

That's how we make findings

We're

I think none of the costs of this suit

MR. BERGERON:

But we think the problem with

21

that is it ends up being a shortcut for causation.

22

And -- and the Court, then, is excused from the

23

performance of the task of actually looking at what the

24

misconduct was and how that impacted the fees incurred.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think it's pretty easy to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

think of hypotheticals and how they might be

2

unrealistic, in which the eventual disclosure of some

3

piece of information that should have been disclosed a

4

lot earlier is so fatal to the defense that the case

5

would be settled as soon as that came to light.

6

You think it's impossible to imagine

7

something like that?

8

Goodyear document here that said, you know, we are going

9

to sell this.

Suppose there were some internal

We are going to market this to RVs, but

10

we know it's really not suitable for RVs.

11

people put it on an RV and they are driving around in a

12

hot climate, the tire is going to explode.

13

And so if

I mean, if you had an internal document like

14

that, it wouldn't be very hard to say, wow, once this

15

comes out, we are going to have no option but to settle

16

the issue of liability.

17

MR. BERGERON:

And I can certainly imagine

18

such a document.

19

document shows that the entire litigation is not in good

20

faith, I think that's a different issue.

21

closer to Chambers.

22

But the problem with that is if the

That's getting

But if it doesn't do that, the problem with

23

using a potential settlement date as the barometer for

24

causation here is -- I can't tell you how many

25

mediations I've walked into when knowing my client's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

risk tolerance and what I thought the other side was

2

going to say, I said, this case is going to settle.

3

Absolutely it's going to settle today and it doesn't

4

happen.

5

you can't -- you would have to really pierce the

6

privilege on both sides to get any sort of determination

7

as to whether they would actually settle.

It just ends up being too speculative because

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, but if a lack of

certainty like that is going to prevent a judge from

10

actually making an award, then people on the other side,

11

people who are victimized, are going to be

12

undercompensated in case after case after case.

13

MR. BERGERON:

But I don't think that that's

14

the case here because, obviously, if a direct causation

15

test is applied and they get the incremental cost that

16

they would have received in the absence of the

17

misconduct, then they received the appropriate

18

compensatory award and it satisfies the due process

19

concerns.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Justice Sotomayor asked

21

you at the outset about the Chambers cases.

22

can't find really strong language in this Chambers case

23

from which to imply a causation or draw a causation

24

conclusion.

25

I just

And Bagwell doesn't even cite Chambers.
MR. BERGERON:

Right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Chambers was not

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

engaging in the same causation analysis that we are

2

talking about today.

3
4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
Clearly it was not.

5

No, it wasn't.

I know.

But why shouldn't it have?

MR. BERGERON:

Well, because what Chambers

6

was recognizing was it did acknowledge that all of the

7

fees were caused by the misconduct, and it did point out

8

that the entirety of the case was built on a fraud, and

9

there was no good faith defense to the litigation.

10

in that circumstance -- and, of course, the district

11

court in Chambers says, this is unique.

12

is a unique situation.

13

So

And it probably

But then when we move to Bagwell, the other

14

point about Chambers is it was built on the foundation

15

of contempt.

16

in distilling a rule from those.

17

with Bagwell because we have the clarification on the

18

distinction between criminal and civil, and Bagwell was

19

drawing that line at causation.

20

extent there is any tension between Chambers and

21

Bagwell, Bagwell should prevail on that point.

22

And so it was built on the contempt cases

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But then that changed

And that's why, to the

Am I to understand the

23

question presented -- as presented was whether there is

24

a direct causation standard applicable to an award under

25

a court's inherent powers.

And you're now saying we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

wanted a but-for incremental cost analysis to define

2

direct cause.

3

define it if it was going to be applied.

4

Then ask your adversary how he would

But you're also asking us to actually apply

5

it in your case.

6

findings de novo or on abuse of discretion?

7

And to review the district court's

MR. BERGERON:

The district court would be

8

reviewed under abuse of discretion.

9

the Court applied the wrong legal test which constitutes

And our point is

10

an abuse of discretion.

11

Court should remand to the district court to allow the

12

Court to apply the direct causation test that the court

13

declined to apply the first time around.

14

We think ultimately that the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

When the district court gave

15

these two awards, the 2.7 and the 2 million, do you

16

understand that to have been 2.7 if I'm not bound by a

17

cause requirement; 2 million if I am?

18

MR. BERGERON:

19
20

I think that's how the court

envisioned it, yes, Justice Kagan.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So then why hasn't that been

21

done already in the district court?

22

you're right, that there is a causation requirement

23

here, we send it back to the district court, hasn't the

24

district court already performed that calculation?

25

MR. BERGERON:

In other words, if

I think that would be what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

the Respondents would say.

2

that is that we waive anything beyond the 700,000.

3

point is that we preserve that and, therefore, the Court

4

would need to go through and -- go through the exercise

5

of actually applying a direct causation test on these

6

facts as they are here.

7

And their whole argument on
My

And I think what -- if you look at what the

8

district court did, it found very specific dates of

9

misconduct.

So you could look at those dates of

10

misconduct, what those episodes were, and then compare

11

them to the time records.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What's the difference

13

between the 2 million and the 2.7?

14

in there; costs for what?

15

MR. BERGERON:

What is the $700,000

The $700,000 represented the

16

fees incurred in pursuit of the other defendants,

17

because there were two other defendants in the

18

underlying litigation besides Goodyear.

19

look, if you're pursuing those other defendants, it's

20

clearly not being impacted by the misconduct of

Goodyear.

first footnote of that filing that we were preserving

11

our Miller argument which had been raised previously.

12

Miller was a Ninth Circuit decision, they didn't impose

13

direct causation in our view.

14

And so our point is we understand if you

15

disagree with us and say, we waive that; then that would

16

be the remedy.

17

direct causation analysis was never done in the first

18

place, there would need to be a remand for that exercise

19

to take place.

My point, though, is that because the

20

And I think it's important as you look at

21

what the district court found, and this gets back to,

22

you know, why is this not like Chambers.

23

court found that the discovery costs were inflated by

24

the misconduct and that the case would have been more

25

complicated -- was rendered more complicated by the

Alderson Reporting Company

The district

2

for how litigation should have proceeded.

3

there is a difference, and that difference there is

4

capable of determination.

5

are raising in terms of that this is something that can

6

be quantifiable.

7

9

But that assumes that there was a baseline

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And then

And that's the point that we

What costs do you concede

you're responsible for?
MR. BERGERON:

We would concede we are

10

responsible for the direct harm flowing from the

11

misconduct that the district court found.

12

would include the expert discovery, the deposition of

13

Mr. Osborn and any related preparation or follow-up

14

that deposition, the efforts to get the tests, if there

15

was discovery requests or negotiations or discovery,

16

perhaps a status conference, the Olsen deposition where

17

the district court found misconduct in the preparing for

18

and following up on that deposition, and then the

19

hearings where the misconduct occurred and any

20

preparation for those.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

MR. BERGERON:

23
24
25

And that

to

So how much is that?
I don't have a number for

you, Justice Kagan.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's not anything like

the full 2 million?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

MR. BERGERON:

It's not.

It would not be.

2

And ultimately, I don't want to be exclusive here

3

because the challenge is we never had an actual fee

4

application that says, these are the categories of fees

5

that were incurred as a result of your misconduct and

6

then we could respond to that.

7

because the district court said, you get everything.

8

they said, we want everything.

9

other categories that they would say and then we would

We never had that,
So

And so they may have

10

debate that before the district court.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You said you wanted to use

12

the Fox v. Vice standard, and part of that is the

13

but-for causation inquiry.

14

clear statement that we don't expect district court

15

judges to be, you know, green eye-shade accountants, is

16

I think what we called them.

17

MR. BERGERON:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And part of that is a pretty

Right.
To go over each, you know,

19

hour of an attorney's work.

20

courts are going to have to make some broad categories

21

and some guesstimates.

22

We understand the district

Do you agree with that too?

MR. BERGERON:

We do.

I mean, there is

23

certainly going to be discretion by the district court.

24

We actually think that this test is going to be easier

25

to apply at the end of the day, because if it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

incumbent upon the proponent to say -- to internalize a

2

direct causation but-for test, and then make the

3

arguments and say, these are the categories of fees that

4

were incurred as a result of misconduct and then here is

5

the concomitant fee -- time entries, that would be --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you -- what do

7

you do then with the plaintiff's position that this case

8

would have settled much earlier, which the district

9

judge accepted?

10

MR. BERGERON:

And we would say that that's

11

an inappropriate basis for the reasons I said earlier,

12

an inappropriate basis as a substitute for causation.

13

Allowing the court to use a cutoff date and just sweep

14

everything going forward would be inappropriate.

15

even if you disagreed with me on that, as Judge Watford

16

noted in dissent, there was no record support for that

17

conclusion by the district judge.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

Suppose there was a

19

finding made in another case that the case would have

20

settled much earlier.

21

Then what?

MR. BERGERON:

Then I would go back to my

22

first point which is that's an inappropriate basis upon

23

which to obviate the need for causation, that the Court

24

should not be getting into a temporal line drawing in

25

terms of how we determine what fees may or may not have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

been caused by misconduct.

2

Instead, it would be looking at, you know,

3

what are the categories that were caused by the

4

misconduct and making those calculations going forward.

5

But -- but once you start -- once you

6

sanction the ability to just draw a temporal line in the

7

sand, then I think that makes it too easy for courts to

8

avoid, actually, the -- the hard work sometimes -- some

9

cases can be easy -- but the harder work of going

10

through and looking at the -- the ultimate time entries.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if you're not -- and

12

I -- I thought you admitted earlier that it wouldn't be

13

appropriate for us to say that could never happen, or

14

maybe I misunderstood your answer.

15

But suppose we think that there could be

16

circumstances in which a court could say this would have

17

settled based on the fatal nature of the disclosure.

18

This would have settled sooner, had it been properly

19

disclosed.

20

says this is never -- it -- although a court is

21

sometimes permitted to do this, legal rule has to be it

22

has to be done only in the clearest of cases or

23

something like that.

24
25

You would have to fall back on a rule that

MR. BERGERON:

Well, and that's why I go

kind of with my -- with my first point, which is we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

shouldn't be -- once you start going down -- once you

2

open the door to that, I think there is a problem on the

3

application.

4

rule that is workable and can be internalized by the

5

district court.

And what we are trying to do is provide a

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it odd that the -In other words, the more

8

egregious the -- the -- the violation the harder it is

9

to show causation.

10

That seems odd.

MR. BERGERON:

Well, no, Justice Kennedy, I

11

disagree.

12

engage in more misconduct, you are going to necessarily

13

generate more fees in response to that, and there is

14

obviously a deterrent effect of this award.

15

Because the -- the point is if you -- if you

The -- the lead counsel no longer practices

16

law, Your Honors, and this order is going to follow

17

Goodyear for years.

18

award is $2.7 million or a million dollars, it has

19

significant deterrent effect, and obviously, we are

20

dealing with follow-on litigation going beyond this.

21

But that this is something that, at -- at the end of the

22

day, if there is an appropriate causation test applied,

23

then the proponent of sanction gets made whole by that,

24

and it satisfies any due process concerns.

25

And -- and this is -- whether the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but, Mr. Bergeron,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

you're saying well, you should use a causation test, but

2

you can't ever consider the likelihood of settlement.

3

But the likelihood of settlement might be -- might not

4

be here, but might be in another case, quite relevant to

5

the question of what fees have been caused by the

6

misconduct.

7

MR. BERGERON:

It -- and I -- so what I

8

would say to that is yes, you could envision a case

9

where that might happen.

At -- at -- on the facts of

10

this case, it couldn't.

11

preference is a rule of law that would said you can't,

12

but if you left the door open for that, that would be

13

one possibility.

But if -- and obviously, my

14

If I could reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. EGBERT

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

19
20
21

MR. EGBERT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The district court and the Ninth Circuit in

22

this case both acknowledge that there needs to be a

23

causal link between the sanction misconduct and the fees

24

and costs awarded as sanctions.

25

has been argument that there was a rejection completely

So to the extent there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

of a causation link, completely, that simply is not the

2

case here.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How does it -- what

4

is the causation link between their misconduct and the

5

fees incurred with respect to other defendants?

6
7

MR. EGBERT:

there's -- there is two answers to that, Your Honor.

8
9

Well, one thing is -- well,

One is that, on a very simple level, if we
had the very strong evidence of the -- that was

10

concealed here that showed that the tire was defective,

11

and -- because of the -- the Heat Rise test and that

12

evidence, that it may have been that we would not have

13

needed to go against any of the -- the other defendants

14

at all.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but I mean

16

the -- as I understand it, the allegations with respect

17

to the other defendants did not have relationship to the

18

Heat Rise test, and if -- if -- or -- if that's the

19

case, you're saying well, we would have gotten enough

20

money from Goodyear; we wouldn't have cared about the

21

money from the others?

22

MR. EGBERT:

No, Your Honor.

This was a

23

situation where there -- there was an accident and

24

the -- there was -- the other defendants were the

25

builders of the chassis of the motor home and the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

other -- the builder of the motor home, and then the --

2

the tire manufacturer.

3

there.

4

So we knew somebody was at fault

If we knew that it was clearly Goodyear

5

because of the concealed evidence that was so

6

devastating to their case, it's possible that the --

7

there would be no need to go after the other chassis

8

maker who had nothing to do with the --

9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
standard?

11

Well, is that the

It could be possible?
MR. EGBERT:

Well, Your Honor, it -- it's --

12

the -- the standard is that we are asking district court

13

judges to make factual determinations.

14

case, we've got a district court judge who has sat

15

through five years of litigation.

16

issues -- what the critical issues are in the case.

17

knows whether or not that evidence that was withheld and

18

ultimately disclosed was crucial to that, and that's

19

what she characterized it as.

20

evidence on a central issue.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And in this

She knows what the

She said it was crucial

Did the other defendants

22

contribute to the settlement that was ultimately

23

reached?

24

MR. EGBERT:
that to be the case.

She

Your Honor, I do not believe

They -- they were out of the case

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28

earlier on than Goodyear was.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

You -- you just said, I

3

thought, that the Ninth Circuit accepted a causation

4

requirement.

Did you just say that?

5

MR. EGBERT:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, Your Honor.
I didn't read the -- the

7

Ninth Circuit opinion that way.

8

of the appendix of the petition.

9

reads Chambers to mean that all attorneys' fees may be

I'm looking at page 32A
The Ninth Circuit

10

awarded once the sanctionees begin to flout their clear

11

discovery obligations and engage in frequent and severe

12

abuses of the judicial system, and then it goes on to

13

say that -- that the district court -- that there

14

wasn't -- that the Supreme Court expressly rejected the

15

linkage argument made by the sanctionees.

16

So that doesn't seem to me to be accepting

17

any kind of causation requirement; rather, to say where

18

you've got very frequent and -- and pervasive abuse, you

19

get everything.

20

MR. EGBERT:

No, no, Your Honor.

There are

21

other sections in the opinion, and I'll talk about the

22

portions that you just read.

23

But they -- the Ninth Circuit says the

24

district court did all it was required to do in this

25

case in determining the appropriate amount of fees to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

award as sanctions to compensate the plaintiffs for the

2

damages they suffered as a result of sanctionee's bad

3

faith.

4

this -- we next consider how close a link is required

5

between the harm caused and the compensatory sanctions.

And then they went on, they expressly said in

6

Part of the confusion that exists here is

7

that Goodyear argued -- when they argued direct

8

causation initially, and even in the Ninth Circuit, they

9

were arguing a different concept than they do today.

10

What they were advocating for was that the

11

trial court judge needed to go through the billing

12

statements, and with respect to each line item, directly

13

link it to a specific instance of misconduct.

14

court judge says, I don't have to do that.

The trial

15

When she rejected that direct causation, it

16

was that that was sanctionee's argument of that concept

17

that she was rejecting.

18

that there had to be a causation, some compensatory

19

aspect of this.

She didn't reject the concept

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why did she say -Judge Watford --

22

Judge Watford disagrees with your reading of the

23

majority, right?

24
25

MR. EGBERT:

I think he does, Your Honor.

But here --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why -- why did the district

2

court set two standards, the 2.7 and the 2.0, if she

3

thought that she was bound by causation?

4

the -- that the whole idea of those two was, one was, if

5

I'm bound by a causation requirement and one was if I'm

6

not.

7

MR. EGBERT:

No, Your Honor.

I thought that

It -- it's

8

close to that, but what it was, was that, if I'm bound

9

by what they are saying that I'm bound by, that I have

10

to go through each of the billing record -- each billing

11

line item and link it to an individual instance of

12

misconduct, if I'm wrong on that, then I'm going to give

13

you -- I'm going to do an alternative award.

14

And -- and let me address for a moment what

15

was asked earlier about whether or not that's been

16

waived.

17

that the 700,000 were all that was causally linked.

18

They didn't argue anything else was -- was suffered from

19

the causal link deficiency.

Because they did, in fact, make the argument

20

What they argued was just the 700,000.

21

they -- they now claim that they preserved it in a

22

footnote in their -- in their papers.

23

significant is if you look at their Ninth Circuit brief,

24

they didn't argue anything beyond the 700,000 there,

25

either.

Alderson Reporting Company

And

But what's

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

So it's really in this Court for the first

2

time that they seek to expand beyond the 700,000.

3

we say that's too late, that they -- they had a chance

4

to argue the causal link deficiency and they did, but it

5

was only to 700,000, and that they should be held to

6

that.

7
8

JUSTICE ALITO:

We --

The Ninth Circuit did not

hold that there was a waiver, did it?

9

MR. EGBERT:

It did not.

10

the -- the contingent award at all.

11

mention it, Your Honor.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It didn't address
It didn't even

You said you were going to

13

respond to Justice Alito's statements from the Ninth

14

Circuit.

I have another one to give you.

15

I mean, this is the closest, it seems to me,

16

as to a standard that comes from the Ninth Circuit, that

17

the district court awarded the amount that the Court

18

reasonably believed it cost the Haegers to litigate

19

against a party during the time when that party was

20

acting in bad faith.

21

Circuit was viewing this chronologically.

22

party was acting in bad faith, all of those costs are --

23

and fees are appropriate.

24
25

So it seems to me that the Ninth

MR. EGBERT:
respectfully, Your Honor.

When the

Well, I -- I disagree
I think what the Ninth

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

Circuit concluded based on the totality of the district

2

court's extensive findings was that this evidence that

3

was concealed and all the related deceits were so

4

important to the plaintiff's claims and so devastating

5

to Goodyear's defense that it -- that it caused the

6

entire litigation as a whole to be a sham.

7

the language that the Ninth Circuit said, we're -- we're

8

going to -- we believe that the whole thing was a sham.

9

And that's

And so to use a train analogy, most sanction

10

cases involved misconduct that merely delays the train

11

or perhaps ultimately -- you know, causes a detour.

12

ultimately, that train arrives at the intended station.

13

In this case, the -- what the district court found, and

14

which the Ninth Circuit agreed, was that the train

15

jumped track and it went in an entirely wrong direction.

16

It didn't even try the case that the claims that -- that

17

my clients had.

18

false set of facts and never, ever -- it was never --

19

because the misconduct was never discovered during the

20

course of this litigation, it was a completely empty

21

charade.

22

tried what Goodyear allowed us to have only.

23

But

It -- it tried the case based on a

It didn't try the real facts of this case.

It

And so because the whole thing was a sham,

24

the district court appropriately said, you know, the

25

whole thing was wasted.

It was a wasted effort and,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

therefore, I'm exercising my discretion in -- in holding

2

that the whole thing should be reimbursed.

3

put you back in the position you were before you started

4

down, jumped track, and went in the wrong direction

5

completely.

6

I've got to

And that's what she awarded.
And -- and who gets to make that kind of a

7

decision?

this case was entitled to make a determination of what

was the central issue in the case?

That's a factual determination.

The judge in

How crucial was this

10

evidence to that central issue?

11

not having that?

12

factual determinations that we want district court

13

judges to make.

14

What was the impact of

I think all of those are the types of

And to Justice -- and to Justice Alito's

15

hypothetical, there can be situations where the -- it

16

can be so devastating that it really could be -- a court

17

could appropriately find that it would have settled at

18

this point and that -- this is such a case.

19

case where the judge, in the exercise of her discretion,

20

made that determination and that we should be -- the --

21

the appellate court should be upholding that.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This is a

What do you do with Judge

23

Watford who said that that finding that it would have

24

settled much earlier is not supported by the record?

25

MR. EGBERT:

Well, the -- his main

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

criticism, Your Honor, was that there were other cases

2

in which the tests were disclosed and they didn't

3

settle.

4

But here's the important point, and this is

5

undisputed:

6

district court judge specifically found that unlike in

7

our case where we had an expert that said -- admitted --

8

Goodyear's own internal expert admitted that anything

9

above 200 degrees would cause problems for the tire,

Judge Silver specifically found -- the

10

cause separation, they didn't have that evidence in

11

those other cases.

12

that showed it was above 200 degrees, significantly

13

above 200 degrees.

14

so damning.

15
16
17
18

All they had was the test results

It's the combination of both that is

It's the -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you describe for

me your definition of direct causation or causation?
MR. EGBERT:

Causation, Your Honor.

I

prefer causation.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. EGBERT:

Give me a definition.

The causation is that it has to

21

be the result of or caused by.

22

it's what we've been -- what the case law has been

23

operating under.

24

in prior case law, and there needs --

25

It's just the "but for,"

There is no use of the word "direct"

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How is it different than

Alderson Reporting Company

Fox, than the definition and the words Fox used?

2
3

MR. EGBERT:

Well, I think it's -- I think

it's a very similar concept.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But why?

Why get into 19

5

different meanings of "cause" in the law?

6

proximate cause is normally defined as a but-for

7

condition and foreseeable.

8

MR. EGBERT:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

I mean,

And -- and, Your Honor -And if we start having --

why should we have some other definition here?

11

MR. EGBERT:

I -- I agree.

I do not -- we

12

have not advocated for adding additional language or

13

modifying --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why don't we just say,

18

foreseeability.

19

she said, well, maybe it's not.

20

She didn't say really that I'm

And, moreover, she said cause and then

So it's sort of ambiguous what she did.

21

Send it back to the Ninth Circuit, say it's proximate

22

cause, that's the test, you apply it.

23

If not, send it back to her.

24
25

MR. EGBERT:

Did she do it?

Good-bye.

Your Honor, to begin with,

whether or not we -- we need to make a clarification

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

with respect to cause generally is a separate issue.

2

But in this case, we submit there's no basis for

3

remanding to the trial court for any further

4

consideration because she already took their causation

5

argument at full face value and adopted 100 percent of

6

their argument and entered the contingent award.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can we go back to the Ninth

Circuit, too?

Well, there's no -- there's

nothing to be left.

argument.

12

that the contingent award should be in effect.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's been a waiver of their

sure that she, in calculating the $700,000, applied an

things like the other defendants and all of that.

17

mean, I'm not sure that unless you accept the idea -- I

18

understand your argument, well, it would have settled

and, therefore, every -- every expense was caused.

20

seems to me that saying the only ones that were

Well, she -- she didn't have to

So your waiver

argument.

MR. EGBERT:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The waiver argument.

Exactly.

Which was not --

6

not -- the Ninth Circuit did not rely on the waiver

7

argument.

8
9

MR. EGBERT:

The -- the Ninth Circuit did

not address the contingent award at all and so didn't

10

need to get into whether or not there was a waiver.

11

Ninth Circuit affirmed on the basis of the larger award.

12

The

So here what we have is, if -- if we're

13

going to say that the trial court used the wrong

14

standard, then we have to say, well, do we need to send

15

it back to -- to use the right standard?

16

they're arguing that the right standard was that they

17

should -- she should have used a different causation

18

standard.

19

and they've told her that if you accept our argument, it

20

adds up to $700,000.

percent.

22

They're --

But they've already made that argument to her

She accepted their argument 100

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I -- I suppose

23

the idea would be that in an opinion, we would provide

24

greater guidance on exactly what type of analysis is to

25

be applied.

And if the district court wants to go ahead

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

and say, well, that's exactly what I did, well, then

2

they -- they can take the case from there.

3

simply because -- and -- and as I look at the

4

calculation, I understand why the 700,000 would be

5

carved out, but I don't think it can be regarded as the

6

application of proximate cause across the board.

7

MR. EGBERT:

But I mean,

Well, I think it certainly was

8

the application of whatever it was the party was

9

arguing.

10

And -- and my concern is that we're going to

give the party a second bite at the apple.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe we don't have to.

I

12

mean, you -- but I have, she said -- the key words here,

13

the district court said is, she said the case is more

14

likely -- more likely than not would have settled much

15

earlier.

16

evidence might have made plaintiffs realize they had a

17

winning trial and they would have refused to settle.

When?

Then she says, but, of course, the

18

MR. EGBERT:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. EGBERT:

And then she said -What?

-- ultimately, I conclude that

21

the most appropriate award given these circumstances is

22

to award all of the fees and costs incurred.

23

And the reason for that, Your Honor, was

24

because the entire litigation became a sham, because we

25

were litigating a false set of facts and it -- and she

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

said that it permeated every aspect of the litigation.

2

Those facts aren't -- those findings are subject to

3

great deference and we -- we ought to be deferring to

4

that -- those findings.

5

of this litigation and then had two years' worth of a

sanction proceeding --

7

And she sat through five years

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you say it

Goodyear in its -- in its reply brief, details the

good-faith defenses it had that were unrelated to the

accident, whether other parties were involved, that the

13

tire was already damaged, the -- you know, all sorts of

14

other things, including ones that went to the question

15

of damages, which surely would have been pertinent in

16

whether the case would have settled.

The trial court looked at that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, and -- and

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

it's hard for me to see how the district court would be

2

in a position, except perhaps in an extraordinary case

3

to -- to make the calculation, oh, the parties would

4

have settled this.

5

your friend on the other side is.

6

about whether to settle the case and a lot of different

7

things go into that calculation, and sometimes they --

8

they line up and sometimes they don't.

9

I mean, you're involved in this;
You know, discussions

But for the district court to -- to make

10

that determination, it seems to me that that would be a

11

very hard calculation.

12

to which your clients need the money, the extent to

13

which your clients -- what their expectations were, what

14

their stomach for going on with more years of litigation

15

is, I don't know how a district court factors in all

16

those considerations.

17

I mean, things like the extent

MR. EGBERT:

Well, Your Honor, even if we

18

accepted that -- that factual finding by the district

19

court as merely an indication of how critical and

20

crucial this evidence was to the case, then we can apply

21

that to her other findings unrelated to, well, it would

22

have settled immediately.

23

She also found that this misconduct was so

24

pervasive and -- that it permeated every aspect of the

25

litigation.

That's -- that's the basis on which the

Ninth Circuit ultimately said that she found that it was

2

a sham.

That the entirety of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about -- what about

Goodrich's argument that the defect in the tire, all of

that was beside the point because the cause of the

accident was road debris?

to swerve off the road.

8

MR. EGBERT:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

Road debris forced this car

Yes.
That would have happened

even if you had a 100 percent fit tire.

11

MR. EGBERT:

Your Honor, you're -- you're

12

right that they're -- that they make arguments that the

13

district court could have and indeed should have found

14

otherwise.

15

16

in our favor would help us and would contradict what the

district court judge found.

What they're in effect doing is they're

But just because there are two possible,

19

reasonable findings of fact from the evidence doesn't

20

mean that the trial court judge was clearly erroneous in

21

making her determination.

22

as long as it's not clearly erroneous, her determination

should stand, not what Goodyear says was also a possible

interpretation of all the facts.

It's her determination.

the determination here in this case.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And at the

And those
And because

Well, I'm not sure

you would call it -- it's not a typical finding of fact

10

to say that based on all of the, you know, issues in

11

terms -- I think the parties would have settled.

12

it more likely than not.

13

elements, but it's much more of a judgment determination

14

than simply this is what happened or this is what would

15

happen.

16

MR. EGBERT:

I find

I mean, it has factual

Your Honor, I -- I agree that

17

it is an unusual finding, but I do think that it is

18

nevertheless a factual finding.

19

that if we're going to put the burden on trial court

20

judges to grapple with cases in which the -- we're not

21

talking -- again, we're not talking about something that

22

slowed the train down.

23

that the district court judge found was pretty

24

monumental, went to the very heart of this case.

we're --

Who knows?

You probably know.

But who knows?

And the key word she leaves out, and there

6

is some evidence she thought she was doing something

7

different -- namely, the 700,000 -- is that she applied

8

a proximate cause standard.

9

that.

She doesn't say she's doing

There is some indication to the contrary.

10

So to be -- I'd just repeat myself that we

11

don't have to decide all those things but for the

12

standard.

13

extra proceeding, and then you make your -- your

14

argument right there exactly what you're saying and say,

15

well, she did apply the right standard.

didn't, we lose the 700,000.

Well, Your Honor, that is

certainly a possible procedure, but we see no need to

even send it back to the Ninth Circuit to further

20

embroil the plaintiffs in what has already been an

21

extraordinary long process.

case is that the -- Goodyear had an opportunity to make

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Assuming the bad faith

6

that the district court found -- not making a judgment,

7

because that hasn't been proffered before us.

8

in fact, you were subjected to the bad faith the Court

found, then sending it back just costs you more money;

10

But if,

right?

11

MR. EGBERT:

That's -- that's all that it

12

accomplishes from my perspective, Your Honor.

13

further delays and costs more money for my clients, who,

14

I believe, have already been adequately victimized

15

through this process.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It just

But the money -- and this

17

is an award of counsel fees, so the money would go to

counsel, not the plaintiff?

19

MR. EGBERT:

Your Honor, that's -- that's

20

outside the record, but I can tell you that it's --

21

that's not how it works under the agreement with -- with

22

the client.

23

We would ask the Court to make -- to take

24

very careful look at not only the aspect of the

25

settlement piece of it that Justice Breyer has -- has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

focused on, but it's also an alternative finding.

2

was one of her two findings that allowed her to -- to

3

award the entirety of the fees and costs incurred.

4

That

The other one is that the misconduct was so

5

severe and pervasive that it permeated every aspect of

6

the litigation.

7

to who would settle or not.

8

Now, that's not a -- a speculation as

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's a distinct finding.
What does that mean?

Is

9

that different from saying that it caused everything?

10

To say that it permeated everything, is that the same

11

thing as saying that it -- it caused everything?

12

MR. EGBERT:

I -- Your Honor, I -- I think

13

it is.

I think that's what the district court judge

14

meant.

If you look at the entirety of her 66-page

15

decision, I think that's what she was getting to, that

16

this was so significant in the context of these specific

17

facts that it -- it changed everything.

18

know, they talk about, well, what -- what would you put

19

on your list of what we can recover?

20

21

we made the wrong argument.

22

that was done was affected by --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

We -- in -- you

Well, every
Every motion,

Everything -- every effort

That's the question, then.

24

That's the legal question.

25

If, in fact, it is the case that a district court would

It's very suitable for us.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

not have awarded $15 or 15 million, whatever it is, this

2

amount, it would have found no causation or would not

3

have found causation and would not have awarded the fee

4

but for the fact it was absolutely egregious, does that

5

permit the district court to award the fee?

6

Now, that is a pure legal question.

And

7

where -- where do you stand on that?

8

seems, on the basis of the precedent -- Rule 11, the

9

mineworkers, and so forth -- the answer to that question

10

I mean, that, it

is no, unless you're going to criminal proceedings.

11

Now, where do you stand on that?

12

MR. EGBERT:

13

Honor, that --

14
15

I agree 100 percent, Your

JUSTICE BREYER:
question.

16

No, but I've asked the

I haven't -- I mean, which side?
MR. EGBERT:

I stand on the -- the side that

17

says that it does have to be compensatory.

18

cannot say, well, this was very bad.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. EGBERT:

Simply

Okay.

There has to be causation.

And

21

our position had -- I think we read both the district

22

court decision and the Ninth Circuit decision as a

23

whole.

24

can pull out that create confusion, particularly in the

25

district court decision, because she was looking at some

Admittedly, there -- there are lines that one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

Ninth Circuit decisions that created confusion for her.

2

But at the end, both of them acknowledged

3

that there's a causation requirement, and we do not shy

4

from that.

5

of having to use criminal -- the heightened criminal due

6

process protections.

7

situation.

8
9

We -- because you would then be in the realm

But that -- that is not our

We believe that the two alternative findings
of fact are sufficient for the award of all of the fees

10

and costs that were incurred.

11

all of them, I'm talking about from a -- a point early

12

on in the litigation, not from the very beginning, but

13

early on throughout the end because the Court and the

14

Ninth Circuit agreed that the entirety of the litigation

15

was a sham.

16

And, again, when I say

Yes, there -- there were other things that

17

were done in terms of medical depositions, but they were

18

all done in the context of an empty charade.

19

you do things in the context of an empty charade,

20

they're still empty.

21

the district court did not abuse her discretion in

22

making those findings and that they should be affirmed.

23

of or cause by test that Mr. Egbert just articulated.

7

It never went down that path, and the -- what they seem

8

to be arguing in their brief was that there is a

9

distinction between, as Justice Breyer was noting, the

10

truly egregious from the less egregious, which was how

11

the district court tried to draw the line.

12

As we pointed out, that's not an effective

13

way of drawing the line.

14

where you would say, well, this is truly egregious; so

we obviate the need for causation.

egregious, so we have to have more tailoring.

don't provide a satisfactory response to that.

On the point about what we argued at the

on the correct legal standards, so we asked the whole

22

thing to be remanded to the district court.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I do understand that.

25

made that -- that I had not thought of the case in,

But one argument they have

Alderson Reporting Company

Justice Breyer said, we don't know what would have

happened.

3

have settled right away.

4

for more money.

5

That's what the district court said.

Could

It could have gone to trial

His argument that -- which he was really

6

saying was this was a sham litigation, because with the

7

proper information, everything related to your client,

8

at least, would not have happened the way it did.

9

Things would have been a very different litigation.

10

From that moment on, whether through settlement or not,

11

you wasted their time and the court's time, because

12

everything was infected by the failure to give the Heat

13

Rise test.

14

Why isn't that put forth, if you --

15

MR. BERGERON:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -He used the analogy of

Right.

Well, the --

So why isn't the travel

on that route compensable?
MR. BERGERON:

Well, the problem with that,

23

Your Honor, is that was the Ninth Circuit's gloss on

what the district court did.

made any finding that there was sham litigation here.

what would you need to redo at that point.

There are so many things that

And I think this gets back to --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

She did say more than not.

19

She did say more -- this case, more likely than not,

20

would have settled much earlier.

21

about she used the wrong word earlier.

22

arguing about that apparently.

23

And you'll be arguing
They are not

So more likely than not, it would have

settled.

25

the fact that it didn't settle are costs that you have

Therefore costs that do, in fact, flow from

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

to pay.

2

It sounds like a causation standard.
MR. BERGERON:

But, Justice Breyer, we

3

disagree that it is a causation standard.

4

a lot of the reasons the Chief Justice raised earlier.

5

In fact, for

I mean, there is so many issues that go into

6

whether or not you have a settlement and just because

7

there was -- the district court believed that they may

8

have settled earlier, but, again, the court didn't say

9

when we would have settled earlier and --

10
11
12

JUSTICE BREYER:

You make that an issue

below?
MR. BERGERON:

Yes, we did.

I mean -- and

13

obviously Judge Watford agreed with us in the Ninth

14

Circuit because we made that point -- made that point

15

there, as well.

16

One of the other things I want to emphasize

17

is that the -- part of the reason we need a meaningful

18

causation test is to bring this in line with -- the

19

inherent authority in line with the other sanction

20

regimes so that courts cannot basically avoid the

21

requirements of the other statutory and rule-based

22

sanction regimes by a liberalization of the causation

23

requirement under inherent authority.

24
25

A good example of this is Rule 37.

Rule 37

governs production of documents and the failure to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52

2

3

requirement.

4

to avoid Rule 37, go to inherent authority and get a

5

broader sanctioning power.

That could have been something the
