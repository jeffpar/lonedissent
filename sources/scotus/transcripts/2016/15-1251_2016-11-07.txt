ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The Vacancy Reform Act's limitation on an

12

individual serving as both the nominee and as the acting

13

official for a single office applies only to someone who

14

is currently the first assistant in that office and is

15

acting pursuant to the automatic service rule set forth

16

in Subsection 3345(a)(1).

17

Both the GAO and OLC adopted that

18

interpretation of the Act shortly after its passage.

19

And in the nearly two decades from passage of the Act

20

until the D.C. Circuit decision here, Presidents of both

21

parties have made scores of nominations and designations

22

based on that interpretation of the text without

23

recorded objection from even a single Senator or staff

24

member.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General Gershengorn, can I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

ask:

2

out these words "notwithstanding Section" -- "Subsection

3

(a)(1)."

4

As you read this statute, suppose you just took

What would then the effect of the statute be?
GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I

5

think that our textual argument would be much more

6

difficult, and the effect of the statute would be

7

effectively to override (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3).

8
9

The "notwithstanding" clause really is the
anchor of our textual interpretation.

But its strength,

10

I think, comes not only from its text, but also how it

11

fits so well with both the history, structure,

12

contemporaneous interpretation, and practice.

13
14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But just focusing on text

for a minute.

15

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure.

If that's true, if the

17

entire textual argument really does rest on the

18

"notwithstanding Subsection (a)(1)" -- I mean, typically

19

when you have a "notwithstanding" clause, it means, you

20

know, take away Subsection (a)(1), not, you know, close

21

your eyes to Subsection (a)(1).

22

anything more than that.

23
24
25

But it doesn't do

So why do you think it should be taken to do
something more than that in this case?
GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Your Honor, we think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

that because it's a routine application of the expressio

2

unius canon in the context of the "notwithstanding"

3

clause.

4

reasons.

And so we think it has power for at least three

5

First -- and we're on pages 82A and 82 --

6

83A of the government's brief -- the -- the expressio

7

unius implication is very strong here, because if you

8

read the statute on page 82A, (a)(1) sets out the first

9

assistant rule, (a)(2) sets out the -- the PAS rule for

10

a Senate-confirmed official, and (a)(3) then sets out

11

the act -- the career official or the agency with --

12

agency official with substantial service.

13

The very next words in the statute are

14

"notwithstanding Subsection (a)(1)."

15

(a)(2), and (a)(3), Congress said, "Notwithstanding only

16

(a)(1)."

17

So after (a)(1),

We think the expressio unius counter is

18

particularly powerfully, because Congress could have

19

said, if we're -- we wanted to do a respondens se,

20

notwithstanding subsection (a), but it did not do that.

21

And it's particularly powerful as well, because the

22

"notwithstanding" clause, as Your Honor suggests, is one

23

that Congress uses all the time.

24

notwithstanding any other provision in the code,

25

notwithstanding any other section of the --

Congress will say,

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But can I give you a hypo?

2

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure.

So the hypo is, I'm at a

4

restaurant, and I -- I'm talking to my waiter, and I

5

place three orders.

6

house salad.

7

three, I'll have the fruit cup.

8

waiter, notwithstanding order number three, I can't eat

9

anything with strawberries.

I say, number 1, I'll have the

Number two, I'll have the steak.

Number

And then I tell the

10

So on your theory, the waiter could bring me

11

a house salad with strawberries in it, and that seems to

12

me a quite odd interpretation of what's a pretty clear

13

instruction:

14

No strawberries.
GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I

15

think this really is fundamentally different for a

16

number of reasons.

17

First of all, we have before us, in contrast

18

to your -- your waiter hypothetical, we have before us

19

the very history of this clause which suggests an

20

interpretation very much in line with the government's

21

interpretation.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I -- I take it, you know,

23

you have some arguments, some strong arguments on -- on

24

history and on practice, but, you know, again, I'm just

25

sort of -- isn't that just a peculiar way to understand

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

the, you know, notwithstanding order number three, no

2

strawberries?

3

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So I don't think it

4

is, Your Honor, and I -- I -- in a footnote, the -- if,

5

for example, you had been a routine -- a regular member

6

of that restaurant -- regular diner at that restaurant

7

and had always understood that you couldn't have

8

strawberries with only one of those things, then the

9

waiter would be justified in interpreting it

10

differently, and we have that contemporaneous practice

11

here.

12

But given Your Honor's textural point only

13

for the moment, I do think that's exactly what this

14

Court held in Preseault, in -- in -- where there was a

15

"notwithstanding" clause, that said, notwithstanding the

16

provisions of the Act, funds -- that you have to rely on

17

advance appropriations, and this Court said, no, that

18

doesn't override the existence of the Tucker Act.

19

I point the Court as well to the case cited

20

in our brief, SEC v. Mount Vernon Memorial Park, which

21

is a situation extremely similar to this, if I could

22

just take a sec on that because I think it will help.

23

That was an interpretation of the Investment Company

24

Act, and it said, "An investment company is an issuer

25

who meets one of the following:

(a)(1), (a)(2), and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1
2

(a)(3)."
And for (a)(3), there was something called a

3

(b)(1) limitation, and it said "Notwithstanding (a)(3),

4

an issuer is" -- "you're not an issuer unless you're in

5

the business of issuing securities."

6

said was that the issuer who fell within that

7

limitation, the same (b)(1) limitation, nonetheless was

8

an investment company under (a)(2) precisely because the

9

introductory limitation was limited to notwithstanding

And what the Court

10

(a)(3), and that case is cited in our brief.

11

Shomberg is the same.

12

I think

Our point, Your Honor, is not that it is

13

inevitably that way.

14

never -- is -- is a canon.

15

interpretation, and it may be that, for example, in your

16

restaurant hypo, that would be a -- it would be clear

17

from context.

18

the other aids to statutory --

19

The expressio unius canon is
It's an aid to

But here we really do think that all of

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't there another

20

explanation for why the "notwithstanding" clause of

21

(b)(1) refers only to (a)(1)?

22

there would be a direct conflict between (b)(1) and

23

(a)(1) because (a)(1) says "shall," the first assistant

24

shall perform.

25

President may do certain things.

If it -- without that,

Whereas (a)(2) and (a)(3) say that the
So there isn't the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

same kind of direct conflict between the remainder of

2

(b)(1) and (a)(2) and (a)(3) as there is with respect to

3

(a)(1).

4

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, that

5

is the argument that respondents make, and we simply

6

disagree with that.

7

between (a)(2), which says the President may appoint

8

this person as an acting, and (b)(1), which says the

9

President may not appoint -- appoint a person as an

10
11

We think there is a direct conflict

acting when that person is also the nominee.
That (b)(2) is a very -- is a designation

12

and delegation of power to the President to make a

13

designation, and it is every bit as broad as the -- as

14

the (a)(1) example.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But it's not quite the same

16

kind of conflict.

17

restaurant scenario and modifying it a bit, if she -- if

18

she were to say, or if I were to say to the waiter, "You

19

may bring me the soup of the day, but you may not bring

20

me soup that contains shellfish because I'm allergic to

21

it," there wouldn't be a conflict of the same sort,

22

would there, between those two statements?

23

To -- to pick up on Justice Kagan's

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I do

24

think that there -- I do think there would be, and I

25

think in particular, even apart from the restaurant hypo

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

itself, the whole purpose of (a)(2) is to give the

2

President the power to make a designation when he

3

believes there's a superior official serving elsewhere

4

in the government.

5

restricted by (b)(1) as (a)(1) absent the introductory

6

clause.

7

this.

8

this, and that is precisely the kind of conflict that

9

Congress was getting at.

That grant of power is every much

The -- the (b)(1) says the President may do
(b)(2) says in some circumstances he may not do

10

But even if you thought the text had some

11

ambiguity here, I really do think that the other aids to

12

statutory construction which this Court's have looked

13

to -- this Court has looked to -- over and over, really

14

do work in our favor and really not at all in

15

Respondent's favor here.

16

The -- principally, if one looks at the

17

contemporaneous interpretation and consistent practice,

18

what one sees is the sponsor of the legislation

19

identified precisely the government's interpretation.

20

Both GAO and OLC adopted that interpretation.

21

President --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You went into detail

23

without any elaboration.

It's just a question, and

24

here's the answer, and there's no reason for the answer

25

from OLC.

As far as GAO is concerned, they didn't say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

precisely what happens with category two and three.

2

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I

3

think -- so, two points -- a number of points, but two

4

responding directly to both of those.

5

With respect to OLC, our point is not that

6

this Court should defer to it or defer to the reasoning

7

in it.

8

beginning, from the moment the statute was passed,

9

Congress was aware of the interpretation the Executive

10

Our point -- our point is, from the very

Branch was putting on it and raised no objection.

11

And with respect to GAO, the GAO letter I

12

think is quite significant because GAO recall under

13

Section 3349 is the Congressionally-designated watchdog

14

for the Vacancies Act, and when GAO issued its letter,

15

which I -- I respectfully disagree, Your Honor, I think

16

the GAO letter is quite clear.

17

If you look at it, what it says is there are

18

four ways to make an acting appointment, and for

19

number 1, (a)(1), it says "And you can't be the

20

nominee."

21

For the other three, it does not have that,

22

and the whole point of that letter was to give guidance

23

to Congress.

24

the Senate majority and minority committees, but to the

25

Office of Presidential Personnel, to the White House

So that letter was circulated not just to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

counsel's office, to OPM and OMB.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think you're

3

putting a significant burden on Congress to sort of

4

speak up.

5

If they don't speak up in every instance where they

6

think some prerogative or interpretation is -- is being

7

misapplied or prerogative taken away from them, then

8

there can -- deemed to have acquiesced in it.

9

is a context in which that might be particularly

There's sort of an estoppel against Congress.

And this

10

inappropriate, because maybe the particular appointment

11

contravenes your -- your theory.

12

But a significant number of people in

13

Congress want to see that vacancy filled, you know,

14

under -- even though it contravenes these more general

15

provisions, and that might not be a particular battle

16

they want to fight at that time.

17

very serious burden to impose on the Legislative Branch.

18

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

I -- I think it's a

So, Your Honor, if --

19

we're not imposing a burden on the Branch, but we are

20

asking you not to turn a blind eye to what really

21

happened in this context.

22

What lead up to the Vacancy Reform Act

23

was -- was decades of Congress raising exactly the kind

24

of objections that one would expect.

25

oversight hearings.

There were

There were GAO letters.

Alderson Reporting Company

There were

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

congressional research reports.

2

and forth to the Attorney General complaining about the

3

way the Justice Department and the Executive Branch was

4

handling the vacancies, and -- and ignoring the

5

Vacancies Act.

6

There were letters back

Then what we have is an interpretation --

7

then what we have is the Vacancies Reform Act and an

8

interpretation set out by the author of the very

9

provision we're talking about, Senator Thompson, and

10

opened discussion by GAO, the watchdog of the Vacancies

11

Act, designated by Congress and by OLC, and then

12

silence.

13

So we're not putting a burden -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you have on the other

14

side -- was it Senator Thompson, you have Senator Byrd

15

who seemed to be putting on it the construction that

16

Respondents do.

17

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I

18

think that actually Senator Byrd is quite -- is quite

19

vague about that and omits the "notwithstanding"

20

language.

21

But even if you thought that was sort of a

22

draw, I would note that Senator Byrd, who again was not

23

shy and had weighed in on these Vacancies Act issues,

24

never raised an objection when the -- when Presidents

25

across three administrations continued it into --

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm sorry.

I think it

2

should be noted that, you know, it's one thing to

3

consult legislative history to understand the -- the

4

whole context in which the -- the Congress was acting,

5

but it's quite another thing to rely on an isolated

6

statement and later contradicted by -- by another

7

Senator, and even for those who at times find

8

legislative history helpful, I think this is where it's

9

at its weakest and most unpersuasive.

10

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Your Honor, I

11

disagree -- I don't -- I don't disagree with Your Honor.

12

It is merely one, though, of a consistent stream given

13

the OLC and GAO opinion.

14

So I really would like to get back to the

15

Chief Justice's point, if I could.

16

estoppel by Congress.

17

Court has put -- should put particular weight on this

18

silence here is because it reflects a contemporaneous

19

and uniform interpretation of Congress' understanding of

20

how its own powers are being -- are or are not being

21

infringed.

22
23

It is -- the reason why this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is that -- I'm

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is that not --

how is that not an estoppel?

3

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

It's not an estoppel,

4

Your Honor.

5

interpretation of the plain language that we're putting

6

forward is correct.

7

everybody understood and has acted for 20 years on that

8

assumption.

9

What it is, is further evidence that the

The language supports it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The --

Sounds like the

10

point I was trying to make, is:

11

on the fact that they didn't do anything.

12

you've got other arguments, too, and I appreciate that,

13

but what did they do, then?

14

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

You are putting weight
And you say

Absolutely, Your

15

Honor.

No, I am putting weight on what they didn't do.

16

To me, it is very much the dog that didn't bark.

17

Congress had been barking quite loudly and vociferously

18

for decades on this very issue.

19

statute that was interpreted by its own watchdog in a

20

certain way, and then the barking stopped.

21

to me this Court is really ignoring reality to not -- to

22

not see that that has important weight.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And then it adopted a

And it seems

What would be the

24

consequences if we affirm?

Your brief didn't list a

25

great parade of horribles.

It seems to me that our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16

system is quite capable of accommodating the

2

Respondent's argument.

3

have looked at this, and every one of them has come to

4

the conclusion that the Respondent's reached.

5
6
7

And on that point, eight judges

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I

believe there are important consequences.
So, first, Congress understood that there

8

are often important positions that don't have first

9

assistants to take over.

To cite one at page 11A of the

10

chart, there's an appointment of Linton Brooks, who was

11

a -- who was named as the director in the National

12

Nuclear Security Administration.

13

oversee nuclear counterterrorism.

14

They're the folks that

When the Senate-confirmed director of that

15

agency left, there was no first assistant, and the

16

President, President Bush, put in Linton Brooks both as

17

nominee and to act to take over.

18
19
20
21

So Congress was well aware that there often
weren't first assistants around.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I ask you about the

consequences going backward?

22

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

Your brief did not talk

24

about this, but do you think that if we find against

25

you, that that subjects to some uncertainty actions that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

these 100-plus officials took?

2

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Yes, Your Honor.

If so, what actions?
So, Your Honor, it

5

does -- and that's the second point to Justice Kennedy's

6

question.

7

It does subject the past officials to

8

substantial uncertainty.

In truth, we don't know

9

exactly the extent of it, because we don't know when

10

we'll have defenses of waiver.

11

hearings and the NLRB has an ability to ratify that

3

other agencies don't.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Suppose you didn't have

5

those defenses, because, you know, I'm not sure why you

would necessarily, given that the statute says they're

7

void ab initio if people take it as against these

procedures.

9

to know about those categories of decisions.

10

And if there are, I would like

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I

11

can't list them chapter and verse.

12

kinds of things we're worried about are rulemakings by

13

the heads of agencies, the -- particular designations

14

by -- by the senior officials, and decisions on

15

litigation and other things that may be subject to

16

challenge.

17

But I do think the

We have not gone back and catalogued all of

18

the potential ramifications, but we do think that with

19

over 100 officials over the course of 20 years, the

20

effects of this are really quite significant.

21

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does that 100 include or
Do you know?

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

It is not including

24

military officers, Your Honor.

These are -- these are

25

the acting officials in the Executive Branch, but I

Alderson Reporting Company

2

don't think they're military officials.
The interpretation that the -- that the

3

Court is putting forward -- if I could make a couple of

4

points on the structure and why we really don't think

5

that this is -- that this is the right way to reason and

6

why our way makes sense -- we think what's reflected in

7

the Vacancies Act is a judgment by Congress that before

8

an individual serves as both the acting and the nominee,

9

that there be one of two protections:

that the

10

individual either have been Senate-confirmed before, or

11

that they meet a length-of-service requirement.

12

So in (a)(2), what one sees is that that's

13

in a prior Senate confirmation.

14

length of service.

15

addresses Senate-confirmed officials whose terms have

16

expired, again, it's Senate confirmation.

17

In (a)(3), it's a

And if one looks at (c)(1), which

The entire purpose of (b)(1) is to extend

18

those protections to first assistants.

19

does is, for first assistants, it puts on a

20

length-of-service requirement.

21

exempts from that length-of-service requirement what --

22

the very individuals who have received prior Senate

23

confirmation.

24
25

So what (b)(1)

And then in (b)(2), it

The package works as a seamless whole.

Congress was not putting on a
first-assistant requirement on a PAS appointee from

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

elsewhere in the government, and it was not putting on a

2

first-assistant requirement on a career agency official

3

moved into an acting position.

4

making sure that first assistants who were both nominees

5

and the acting had -- had one of the two protections.

6

What it was doing was

It's also consistent with the way the

7

legislative history is, and the drafting history, with

8

respect -- I think this is very important -- to the PAS

9

positions.

It had been the President's prerogative

10

expressly under the Vacancies Act, back to 1968, to take

11

a PAS officer and put him into an acting position and

12

then still be able to nominate him.

13

the bill preserved that.

The first draft of

14

So after all of the rancor, after all of the

15

unhappiness of the Vacancies Act, the first draft of the

16

bill allowed an acting officer to come in automatically

17

under (a)(1), whereas a PAS under (a)(2), and the (b)(1)

18

restriction, only applied to (a)(1).

19

dispute.

20

And so then what happened?

There's no

Then there was

21

an objection that the bill didn't give enough authority

22

to the President, and so changes were made to give the

23

President more authority.

24

have you believe is that Congress overturned sub

25

silentio, without a single complaint, 130 years of

And what Respondents would

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why do you -- why and

3

how do you think that that change was made, then?

4

Because the change clearly was made.

5

draft, it obviously applied only to first assistants;

6

and then in the final draft, not so obvious at all.

7

And, you know, I agree with you there's no explanation,

8

but there is a change.

9
10

Are you suggesting it was, you know, just a
mistake that somehow happened?

11
12

In the initial

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:
Honor.

13

Absolutely not, Your

And if you'll bear with me, I can explain that.
The initial draft of (a)(1) required a --

14

provided that the person be a first assistant to the

15

officer.

And (b)(1) read as it does.

16

When Congress -- Congress changed that to

17

allow the appointment of officers who were not -- who

18

were -- after the officer dies, and so they changed it

19

to first assistant to the office.

20

that is that somebody could be appointed first assistant

21

even after the vacancy arose.

22

change.

23

the Appendix to the petition where the bill is set out,

24

the original bill, the way the bill read, it -- it put

25

the restriction only on the person who was serving at

The significance of

That was a very big

If Your Honor looks at page 19A of the -- of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the time of the vacancy.

2

left (b)(1) the way it was, it would have created a very

3

odd situation where at the current serving first

4

assistant would be subject to (b)(1), and the after put

5

in, that someone put in later, was not subject to

6

(b)(1).

7

So if the -- if Congress had

So what did Congress do?

Congress changed

8

it so that the limitation applied to all first

9

assistants.

But then it added "notwithstanding" (a)(1),

10

and that is the critical thing.

11

Congress did it, made this change to (b)(1), precisely

12

to deal with the after-appointed first assistants, and

13

then it added the "notwithstanding" clause to say

14

notwithstanding only (a)(1).

15

Your Honor, that it was a very important change.

16

So in other words,

And so it does seem to me,

And I think if Your Honor chases -- chases

17

through the legislative history and looks at 19A and way

18

the provision works, you will see that that was the

19

reason -- that that was the reason for the change.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you -- if your -- if

21

your interpretation is the correct one, what is your

22

answer to the horrible that appears in the -- in the

23

Respondent's brief at 33 to 34?

24

the statute the way the government does, then you could

have somebody in there who has never been read --

2

3

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

You could have

So, Your Honor, the

4

response to that is there's no doubt that someone can

5

serve for that length of time, and that Congress

6

understood that.

7

limits in the Vacancies Act.

8
9

That's the consequence of the time

What Respondents are arguing is that should
only be true for first assistants but should not be true

10

for -- for individuals that the President appoints

11

under -- designates under (a)(2) and (a)(3).

12

that irrationality that we think the statute -- it's

13

that difference that we think the statute just doesn't

14

justify.

15

So just to be clear:

And it's

It is -- it is crystal

16

clear under both Respondent's view and our view that an

17

individual can serve for a very long period of time.

18

That's the consequence of the -- of the 210-day --

19

210-day period and the various ways you can extend it.

20

The question before you, though, is whether

21

it makes sense that Congress decided only the first

22

assistants could do that.

23

doubt that.

24

give the President himself -- and it could only be the

that the 1100-day scale, or however many days, could

chosen by the President for that very reason under

(a)(2) and (a)(3).

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14
15

MR. DVORETZKY:
it please the Court:

16
17

Four features of the FVRA's text and
drafting history compel our interpretation.

18
19

First, Congress used the broad terms "a
person" and "this section."

20

Second, "notwithstanding" is a term of

21

expansion.

22

"person" and "section."

23
24
25

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

It does not contract the broad meaning of

Third, the government's interpretation makes
Subsection (b)(2) superfluous in multiple ways.
And fourth, at the time that Congress added

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

(b)(2), it deleted language from the initial draft of

2

(b)(1) that expressly limited the provision to first

3

assistants.

4

officers.

5

The revised language encompasses all acting

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I agree that "person"

6

and "section" are very strong arguments for you.

7

Suppose what the statute said is "notwithstanding (a)(1)

8

and (a)(2)"?

9

argument with respect to whether or not it affected

10

And what -- what would then be your

(a)(3)?

11

MR. DVORETZKY:

I still think in that

12

circumstance that "person" and "section" would apply to

13

(a)(3).

14

case is that there is no meaningful distinction between

15

(a)(2) and (a)(3) and the role that they play in the

16

statute.

But the reason that that would be a different

17

There is a meaningful distinction between

18

(a)(1) on the one hand and (a)(2) and (a)(3) on the

19

other hand.

20

distinction that Congress would single out just (a)(1).

21

And it makes sense because of that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't get that,

22

Mr. Dvoretzky.

And maybe this follows the government's

23

line of thought, but, you know, I've been -- the (a)(1)

24

says, "The first assistant shall be the acting officer."

25

And then (b)(1) says, no, she may not be.

Alderson Reporting Company

Right?

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

(a)(2) and (a)(3) doesn't use the words "shall," but it

2

says, the President may appoint any of these people.

3

And then (b) comes along and says, no, the President

4

can't appoint some subset of them.

5

So the basic conflict seems to me to be the

6

same in both cases, which is that the second clause says

7

not so fast, not with respect to those people.

8
9

MR. DVORETZKY:

Justice Kagan, the

difference is that (a)(1) is a self-executing provision.

10

It automatically places the first assistant into the

11

vacant office, and (b)(1) then takes the person out.

12

(A)(2) and (a)(3) are grants of discretion that has to

13

be understood side by side with --

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But those grants of

15

discretion are very broad, and then (b)(1) again takes

16

the person out, takes the person out of the grant of

17

discretion, just as it takes the person out of the

18

self-executing provision before them.

19

MR. DVORETZKY:

They -- they are broad only

20

if read in isolation, but they can't be read in

21

isolation as a statutory matter.

22

President doesn't read them in isolation as a practical

23

matter.

24
25

And oftentimes, the

In other words, there is no way to avoid the
conflict created between (a)(1) and (b)(1) because

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

(a)(1) puts the person in the job and (b)(1) takes them

2

out.

3

If the President, however, simply reads

4

(a)(2) and (a)(3) together with (b)(1), then he knows

5

what the limitations are on his discretion, and he can

6

avoid that ripping out.

7

nominee from acting service that creates a particularly

8

stark conflict that Congress sought to address through

9

the "notwithstanding" (a)(1) clause.

10

It's that ripping out of the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I have to say, I find it a

11

little bit odd to think of this drafter thinking of the

12

kind of distinction you're making.

13

self-executing and this is not self-executing.

14

only a broad grant of discretion.

15

realizing that just by virtue of saying "notwithstanding

16

(a)(1)," the statute creates -- raises this question

17

about, well, you've said (a)(1) but not (a)(2) or

18

(a)(3).

19

Say, well, this is
It's

And then not

What does that mean?
I mean, that seems just like a very strange

20

drafter to me, somebody who is so in the weeds that they

21

can't figure out that pretty obvious objection to what

22

they're doing.

23

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, perhaps one way to

24

think of it, and this goes back to your first question

25

of the argument, what if you had a statute that didn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

have any "notwithstanding" clause at all at the

2

beginning of (b)(1)?

3

clear that "person" and "section" would make (b)(1)

4

applicable to (a)(2) and (a)(3).

5

In that situation it would be

There would be a question in that situation,

6

though, whether (b)(1) also applied to (a)(1), first of

7

all, because of the starkness of the conflict between

8

(a)(1) and (b)(1), and second of all, the government

9

argues that the general versus specific canon would

10

apply there, but it wouldn't necessarily because the

11

general versus specific canon is typically invoked in

12

order to avoid superfluity where you have one general

13

provision and a specific provision that would be

14

meaningless if not read as an exception to the general.

15

Here, however, in -- in the hypothetical

16

statute without the "notwithstanding" clause, you

17

wouldn't have superfluity concern because (b)(1) would

18

apply to (a)(2) and (a)(3).

19

particular question, not about (2) and (3), but just

20

about (1).

21

out (1) because of the particular role that it's playing

22

in the statute.

23

And so you'd be left with a

And so it makes sense that Congress singled

That's why the three categories of acting officials are

(a)(1) to (a)(3), but (c), by its text, is just doing

5

something different.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why -- why -- the thing --

7

I'd like to go back to the Solicitor General's last

8

point, and that's where I'm having -- I have a puzzle.

9

I'd like to hear what you have to say.

10

I mean, for the purposes of this question,

11

I'm assuming all the text, which sounds to me, if a

12

person came from Mars, that's what he would expect a

legal argument to be like.

The -- the number's all over had the place,

and I will also assume that for every chef salad there

So -- so everything balances out.

Now, it seems to me that this exception here

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

Now, what this statute as you read it would

7

seem to say, if you appoint whichever one you choose,

8

put any one of those three people in, go ahead, do it.

9

Now, if you nominate those, one of those three to a

11

them are out.

12

There's one exception.

Have I got the statute right?

15

MR. DVORETZKY:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

All of

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.

I would just wonder,

were I from Mars, what's the point of such a statute?

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why is it you're perfectly

20

willing to have stay there and do the acting job the

21

22

not willing to have served the acting job this guy who

17

I get an

So that's what I would like you to respond to.
MR. DVORETZKY:

So I'd like to respond,

18

first of all, to why it makes sense to treat first

19

assistants differently, and second of all, to Bill Lann

20

Lee and how that is relevant to the statute.

21

The legislative history explains in multiple

22

places that first assistants are particularly

23

well-suited to be the acting official because they

24

represent continuity and regularity in the office.

25

We know from (b)(1) that Congress was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

concerned with at least some acting service by nominees.

2

And the reason that it created an exception for first

3

assistants, even as nominees, is that they are the least

4

likely to represent change in the agency.

5

deputy being pushed up one spot, and that's continuity

6

and regularity.

7

It's just the

On the other hand, particularly when

8

Congress added for the first time in the FVRA this

9

category of GS-15s, potentially thousands of employees

10

within an agency, there's no accountability there to

11

Congress and there are potentially much greater concerns

12

about those individuals serving as acting officials

13

while the nominee.

14

that concern.

15

The facts of this case illustrate

The President designated Mr. Solomon to

16

serve as the acting general counsel.

17

he nominated Mr. Solomon.

18

nomination, Mr. Solomon then took some very

19

controversial actions that led the Senate promptly to

20

make clear to the President that this individual was not

21

going to be confirmed.

22

Some months later

Perhaps emboldened by the

Rather than at that point finding a new

23

nominee, the President allowed Mr. Solomon to continue

24

serving even -- even after the nomination had been

25

returned by the Senate, waited four months before

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

renominating the same individual, and then only a few

2

months later after that, finally came up with a nominee

3

that the Senate approved.

4

In the meantime, Mr. Solomon served, even

5

though the Senate quite clearly did not consent to him,

6

served in the job for -- for over three years.

7

And so it is that kind of concern about

8

GS-15s that's fundamentally different from a first

9

assistant who represents continuity and regularity in

10

the office.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If -- if Mr. Solomon had

12

been confirmed, you -- you say that that would be all

13

right, even -- even with the erroneous nomination of him

14

while he was acting.

15

But -- so he's confirmed for the permanent

16

office.

Yet, under your reading, everything that he did

17

while he was acting is invalidated; is that right?

18

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, it's not necessarily

19

invalidated.

20

Circuit identified at the end of its opinion, but under

21

our reading of the statute, when he was nominated, he

22

needed to step aside and he couldn't serve as the

23

permanent official until the Senate confirmed him.

24
25

It's subject to the defenses that the D.C.

the confirmation?

2

MR. DVORETZKY:

That's right.

His

3

confirmation does not in effect ratify the actions that

4

he took when, in our view, he was improperly serving as

5

an acting official.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If -- there's one other

7

peculiarity of this.

This is why I mentioned the

8

90 days, but a first assistant who is also what they

9

call a PAS, presidentially-appointed,

10

Senatorial-confirmed, such a first assistant without any

11

12

But why couldn't the people in category two, that is

13

people who are presidentially-appointed,

14

Senatorially-confirmed in other agencies, why wouldn't

15

the same -- why wouldn't they be treated the same way if

16

the stress is on having someone that the Senate wants

17

approved?

18

MR. DVORETZKY:

Because Senate confirmation

19

for one position is not fungible with Senate

20

confirmation for another.

21

Senate-confirmed first assistant, that again is a

22

combination of Senate confirmation and somebody who's in

23

a first assistant position representing continuity and

24

regularity in the position.

When you're talking about a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You -- you want to

respond to Justice Breyer's point about Mr. Lee?
MR. DVORETZKY:

I do want to get back to the

point about Mr. Lee.
The concern about Mr. Lee was not just that

12

he was brought in from the outside at the last minute,

13

which is what the government emphasizes.

14

the concern, Congress could have imposed a restriction

15

on short-serving first assistants as acting officials.

16

If that were

Instead, what Congress imposed was a

17

restriction on acting officials -- acting officials who

18

are also the nominee, and there's no reason to think

19

that Congress' concern about nominees serving as acting

20

officials was limited just to first assistants.

21

text doesn't support that concern, and as the example of

22

Mr. Solomon's own service illustrates, in practice,

23

Congress can have very serious concerns about people

24

outside of the -- the first assistant category serving

25

as the acting official while also the nominees.

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

And -- and that's a vivid illustration of

2

the example in our brief of somebody who can serve

3

almost an entire presidential -- presidential term as

the permanent -- as the acting official, even though

5

Congress has made clear that the individual is not

6

somebody that -- that the Senate will consent to as the

7

permanent nominee.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I ask Mr. Dvoretzky

about the post-enactment history?

Because, you know,

10

we're generally reluctant to demand that Congress

11

objects to things.

12

But on the other hand, the -- the history

13

here is so strong.

All of these appointments, 100-plus

14

of them, in a time when Congress and the President -- I

15

mean, this is -- this has been a time where there's been

16

a lot of partisan bickering over appointments, and you

17

would think that in that context, if anybody had thought

18

that this statute could be read differently, we would

19

have heard about it, and yet we hear absolutely nothing.

20

So how do you explain that?

21

MR. DVORETZKY:

22
23

Several points in response

to that.
First, just identifying these FVRA

24

violations is not an easy thing to do.

25

government months of study to do it, and it's an arcane

Alderson Reporting Company

It took the

Official - Subject to Final Review

technical issue.

2

Second of all, even if Congress had

3

identified the violations, what was it supposed to do

4

about them?

5

wants to approve, there's no point in rejecting them

6

based on their past improper service.

7

the FVRA requires.

9

hadn't approved.

If the nominee is somebody that the Senate

That's not what

And doing so would only prolong the

odds are it has a reason for doing so that is much more

14

objections.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The FVRA does not

I don't know.

It's other

Wouldn't you

16

say something like I don't like this nominee, and

17

anyway, it's illegal for the President to make this

18

nomination?

19

MR. DVORETZKY:

You might add that, but it

20

would be a gratuitous addition to what is really the

21

fundamental concern with the nominee.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

Seems like it gives it some

real extra oomph, right?

24

(Laughter.)

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's not just -- it's not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

just a matter of my preferences versus the government's

2

preferences.

3

It's off the board.

4

Who wouldn't say that in that circumstance?

5

Now the President's preference is illegal.
Congress has said he can't do it.

MR. DVORETZKY:

Somebody who then was going

6

to be pressed and had to explain the technicalities of

7

why the appointment was illegal.

8

(Laughter.)

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

You -- you have been -- and

10

I understand -- you've been concerned about instances in

11

which there is controversy over appointment.

12

are thousands of jobs in the government where they have

13

to run departments where there's no controversy, you

14

know.

15

But there

And people leave, or they die, or something

happens; there's a vacancy.

And the main institutional

17

imperative is keep the job being done.

Assistant, you carry on.

Okay?

20

somebody from next door.

And maybe you look for a GS-18

21

in the department.

22

presidential appointment.

23

That's all.

Keep the office

So an obvious person is to say Mr. First
And maybe you bring in

You know, the guy next door has a
So you put him in the job.

No problem.

24

And why all of a sudden Congress would, in

25

these thousands of instances where there's no problem,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

or hundreds anyway, Congress would say, if you decide to

2

appoint him permanently, you have to take him

3

immediately out of the acting position, and there's more

4

disruption in the department.

5

do that?

6

Why would anyone want to

Now, I could see they might want to do it

7

with the first assistant where it's a runaround, and

8

they have an idea that it's a runaround when he hasn't

9

served as first assistant for more than 90 days.

10

you might say, well, why him?

11

trying to get this controversial guy in.

12

Maybe they were just

In other words, as -- as an administrator in

13

noncontroversial matters, I can understand their

14

interpretation more easily.

15

I'm wrong because?

16

Then

MR. DVORETZKY:

But you will tell me that

The -- the first assistant

17

restriction in (b)(1) reflects that Congress clearly was

18

concerned about some acting officials who are also the

19

permanent nominee.

20

affront to its advice and consent role, and that

21

exemplifies a lot of the problems that led to the

22

enactment of the FVRA in which the Presidents --

23

Presidents of both parties were putting in their

24

ultimate choice for a position long term without Senate

25

confirmation.

Congress saw that as a particular

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

There's no reason to think that that concern

2

is limited only to first assistants coming in from the

3

outside.

4

of the thousands of GS-15 employee within an agency.

5

And it's not surprising that, in the same set of

6

revisions when Congress added (a)(3), it made -- made

7

those GS-15s eligible to serve, that it also thought,

8

well, perhaps this has the potential for mischief.

9

Perhaps this has the potential to allow just as much of

10

an end -- of a runaround of our advice-and-consent role

11

as the first assistants.

Those concerns are equally applicable to any

12

Likewise, with respect to the PAS officials,

13

it's true that PAS officials had previously been able to

14

serve as both permanent nominees and acting officials,

15

but the FVRA rethought this entire area of vacancies.

16

And it's not surprising that, while -- while Congress

17

was also prohibiting GS-15s, this new category from

18

serving as acting officials while nominees, that it also

19

swept in the (a)(2)s as well.

20

There's also a practical point about how

21

this actually operates.

Much of the time, over

22

30 percent of the time, the President nominates and

23

designates, either at the same time, or -- or the

24

President nominates first and designates second after

25

apparently becoming impatient with the confirmation

Official - Subject to Final Review

43

process.

2

And so, Justice Breyer, your hypothetical --

3

your hypothetical was asking why does it make sense to

4

take the official out of the job once they are

5

nominated?

6

President is nominating the person and then making them

7

the acting official later.

8

person out of the job.

9

Often that doesn't even happen.

Often the

So you're not taking the

Moreover, our interpretation of the statute

10

removes one person from the pool of acting officials.

11

There -- there is not -- this is not a situation where

12

we are taking out the thousands of GS-15s or PAS

13

officials.

14

We're taking out the one person that reflects the

15

biggest affront to Congress' advice-and-consent role if

16

allowed to serve while also nominating.

17

There are lots of people available to serve.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And defeating the

18

efficient running of the department at the same time,

19

because if the person has been running the department,

20

now you're going to put it through a second dislocation

21

of having that person removed and somebody else step in.

22

MR. DVORETZKY:

Again, in practice, over a

23

third of the time, that doesn't happen.

24

something that the --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's also

It hasn't happened

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

because no one's read it the way you have and

2

invalidated that person's actions so far.

3

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, no.

What I mean is if

4

you look at the government's chart, a third of the time,

5

even if you applied our interpretation, it would not

6

result in the nominee being taken out of acting service

7

because the nominee isn't even put into acting service

8

until later or at the same time as the nomination.

9

Moreover, the President --

10
11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The Senate is taking a

long time to confirm, even when they're not objecting.

12

MR. DVORETZKY:

So in -- in this particular

13

case, after Mr. Solomon had served for some

14

two-and-a-half years, when the President put up a

15

permanent nominee, the Senate confirmed him in a matter

16

of months.

time.

18

And so the Senate doesn't always take a long

Moreover, the Senate has confirmed

19

approximately 85 percent of PAS officials during the

20

current President's administration.

21

is confirming these officials.

22

is that the official not do the job without Senate

23

confirmation because that would recreate the very

24

problems that the FVRA was intended to combat in the

25

first place.

And so the Senate

What the FVRA requires

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

There's a limited exception for long-serving

2

or Senate-confirmed first assistants, but that makes

3

policy sense because of the continuity and the

4

regularity that they bring to the job.

5

I'd like to address the -- the question that

6

was raised earlier about the consequences of ruling in

7

our favor retroactively in terms of past decisions.

8
9

No court has considered the "no force and
effect" language.

But what I can tell you is that the

10

government has been shoring up a defense that would be

11

tied to the language in 3348 about the functions and

12

duties of a particular office.

13

have no force and effect are those that are taken in the

14

performance of a function and duty of a vacant office.

15

The only actions that

In response to a Senate inquiry about a

16

deputy EPA administrator who had been serving for two

17

years, the EPA took the position that that individual

18

had not taken any actions whatsoever that were actually

19

tied to the functions or duties of the vacant office.

20

On the GAO website, there are approximately

21

two dozen reports of time violations over the years of

22

the FVRA.

23

reported to it that none of those two dozen individuals

24

who served in violation of the FVRA took any actions

25

that were tied to the functions and duties of the

And the GAO reports that agencies had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

office.

And so the government is already shoring up

2

arguments for why the "no force and effect" language

3

would not undo actions taken by these improperly pointed

4

officials.

5

With respect to the GAO, the -- the Acting

6

Solicitor General referred to the GAO as a watchdog --

7
8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The way you described that,

you sound a bit skeptical of those defenses.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, skeptical only in the

11

sense that they're not at issue in this case, and they

12

haven't been litigated.

13

our favor were going to lead the sky to fall, you would

14

expect the government to -- to tell you that.

15

only has the government not told you that, but the --

16

the surrounding context shows that the government thinks

17

it has pretty good arguments for why.

18
19

But if it were, if ruling in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And not

So you say that you can

bring those cases, too?

20

MR. DVORETZKY:

I'm sorry?

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Telling us -- so that --

22

you can bring those cases, too, or for other people to

23

bring them?

24
25

They're in a real catch-22 situation.
MR. DVORETZKY:

The fact is, though, it's

their burden to show the consequences of their actions.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

And the government's track record on this shows just the

2

opposite; shows that these officials supposedly are not

3

doing anything that would actually be invalidated.

4
5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So is Mr. Solomon's case

atypical, the general counsel to the NLRB?

6

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, it's atypical in the

7

sense that it is, under 3348(e), the "no force and

8

effect" language doesn't apply to the general counsel of

9

the NLRB.

It's -- the -- his actions are only voidable

10

rather than void, and that's why the D.C. Circuit looked

11

to the harmless error doctrine and the de facto officer

12

doctrine as additional defenses.

13

But even in a case where the "no force and

14

effect" language did apply, again on the government's

15

theory, challengers would have to show that the actions

16

were -- that the actions that were taken were ones that

17

could only have been taken by an individual in the

18

vacant office.

19

that happens very much.

20

And the government doesn't believe that

With respect to the cases that the

21

government cites for the first time in its reply brief,

22

none of those are on point.

23

the operative language there was "under this act."

24

That's what made clear that the particular provision

25

there applied only to the statute at issue and not

The Preseault case, the --

2

The Mount Vernon case out of the Ninth

Circuit, interpreting the "notwithstanding" clause --

4

the -- the language in the "notwithstanding" clause

5

6

superfluity which is not the case here.

contrary, here the government's interpretation makes

(b)(2) superfluous.

9

To the

Congress specifically added (b)(2) when it

10

expanded (b)(1) to apply to more than just first

assistants, and if (b) -- if (b)(1) did not apply to all

of (a) in the first place, there would be no need under

13

(b)(2) to create an exception for Senate-confirmed first

14

assistants.

15

serve under (a)(2), anyway.

16

Congress would have had to add that (b)(2) was because

17

18

statutory language otherwise applied to all of (a).

19

Those Senate-confirmed individuals could
So the only reason that

The government argues in its reply brief

20

that (b)(2) serves the -- serves a purpose because it

21

saves the President from having to designate someone

22

under (b)(2).

23

Congress would have gone to all the trouble of adding

24

(b)(2) solely to achieve that goal.

25

That's not a plausible account that

And -- and, again, I would return to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49

core language here, which is "person" and "section."

2

Those are broad inclusive terms.

3

to accomplish what the government argues that this

4

statute is accomplishing --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If Congress had meant

Wasn't that the argument,

6

is that language, "person" and "this section," were in

7

the prior bill, where it -- it applied only to first --

8

What do you call it?

9

MR. DVORETZKY:

Only to first assistants.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. DVORETZKY:

-- first assistants?

Because -- because the --

12

that's true, but the language in the prior bill had an

13

old version of (b)(1) -- this is, again, at 19A of the

14

cert petition -- that made clear that the only persons

15

we were talking about were persons who are serving as

16

first assistants.

17

language that made clear and narrowed what "person"

18

meant.

19

There was immediate qualifying

Congress specifically deleted that language

20

and it added a new (b)(2) that would be unnecessary if

21

(b)(1) applied only -- if (a)(1) applied -- I'm sorry --

22

if (b)(1) applied only to (a)(1).

23

If Congress had simply meant to achieve in

24

the draft what the government ascribes to it, the edits

25

could have been much simpler.

It could have simply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

changed 180 days to 90 days in order to shorten the --

2

the required period of acting service, and it could have

3

edited the existing (b)(1) to say, such person serves in

4

the position of first assistant to the office of such

5

officer.

It made much broader changes.

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:
Justice.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

I'd like to make a number of points.

12

First, Justice Kagan, your account of what

13

would have happened in Congress had there been any

14

reason to believe there was a problem with the Executive

15

was doing is exactly right, and we know that because

16

after the D.C. Circuit ruled, in fact, what you said

would happen is what happened.

18

Senators started raising objections to the

19

President's nominees, arguing that they were serving

illegally.

21

the Act, and that's what happened as soon as the D.C.

22

Circuit ruled.

23

very significant.

24
25

That's what happened in the years prior to

That in-between period, I submit, is

Justice Sotomayor, you raised Section
(c)(1).

I think you're exactly right.

Alderson Reporting Company

What their

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

reading of the statute does is read the notwithstanding

2

(a)(1) to mean notwithstanding (a)(1) -- to mean that it

3

applies to (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3), but not (c)(1).

4

I think that's a very odd thing to express with the term

5

"notwithstanding (a)(1)."

6

Justice Breyer, you were asking about why it

7

would make sense to treat the (a)(2) and (a)(3)

8

differently, and I think you're exactly right.

9

not.

10

It does

What Respondent said was there needs to be

11

accountability to Congress.

12

accountability.

13

(a)(2) and (a)(3) need to be personally designated by

14

the President.

15

kind of responsibility that when Congress puts that in

16

the President, this -- it's not surprising then that

17

those folks should be able to serve while they are

18

nominated because they have gotten not only a Senate

19

confirmation or long-standing agency service, but the

20

personal approval of the President.

21

Congress put in that

It said that these individuals under

It cannot be delegated.

That is the

Counsel tried to distinguish the cases that

22

we raised.

I think they are worth raising because it

23

does change, I think, the way this -- this Court has

24

read the "notwithstanding" clause the way we say it.

25

Preseault is a perfect example.

It said,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

notwithstanding this Act, but Congress then didn't read

2

the remainder of clause to provide -- to apply to the

3

whole code.

4

specified in the "notwithstanding" clause.

5

that that's what this Court should do here.

It limited to the Act, which was what was
We think

6

And then finally I'd like to address this,

7

the treatment of PAS officers, which I think is really

8

important.

9

in (a)(2) as well.

What Respondent said was, oh, Congress swept
With that blithe assertion, he

10

attributes to Congress the intent to overturn 130 years

11

of practice that had raised no complaint.

12

evidence anywhere in the congressional record that

14

also -- who were also nominated, and it was not

15

reflected in the initial draft.

16

blithely did that and swept in (a)(2), I think is just

17

not supported by the record.

is no doubt that the provision it was in applied --

assistants.

Finally, on that point -- I know that's my

But the --

12

it does seem that the notwithstanding (a)(1) doesn't do

13

any work in their reading.

14

(a)(1), and then had had (b)(1) without the
