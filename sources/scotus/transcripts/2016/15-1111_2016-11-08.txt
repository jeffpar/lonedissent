CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

5

Corporation v. The City of Miami and the consolidated

6

case.

7

Mr. Katyal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

12

The question in this case is whether cities

13

can sue under one of our nation's most important laws,

14

the Fair Housing Act.

15

yes, sometimes, and I mean three things by that.

16

Our answer to that question is

First, the answer can't be yes always,

17

because that would eviscerate two key doctrines of this

18

Court:

Proximate cause and zone of interests.

19

Second, the answer can't be no, never,

20

because cities can identify concrete harms that fall

21

within the zone-of-interests, such as discrete

22

expenditures to combat a particular defendant's racial

23

misconduct.

24

And third, this lawsuit fails both the zone

25

of interests and proximate cause, because the injury it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

seeks to remedy is unrelated to the Act's purposes, and

2

because that injury is several steps removed from any

3

alleged acts of Petitioners.

4
5

If I could start with zone of interests.
This Court, in Lexmark --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could you -- before you

7

do that, Mr. Katyal, could you please tell us:

8

you said, yes, cities can sue under the FHA, but not

9

this -- not on -- in this scenario.

10
11

You --

Can you tell us what -- under what
circumstances could a city sue?

12

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.

13

So we want -- our position is to preserve existing law

14

exactly where it is, and existing law identifies two

15

places where cities can sue.

16

situation in which a city, like the NGO in Havens, is

17

combatting discrete instances of discrimination by

18

defendant, and outlaying things, so testers or

19

something.

20

One is a Havens-like

So if you took the allegations in this

21

complaint and -- and when -- we made them out to be the

22

banks were engaged in some sort of discriminatory loans,

23

and the City had to -- had to basically expend funds to

24

test that out to enforce its housing statutes, that

25

looks very much like the one-to-one relationship that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

was at issue in Havens, both for zone of interest and

2

for proximate cause.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

In Havens,

4

the testers were not city employees.

5

were private organizational employees whose job it was

6

to do this.

7
8

In Havens, they

So why are you attributing the testers' work
to the City directly?

9

MR. KATYAL:

Because, Justice Sotomayor, in

10

that case -- and this is paragraph (F) of the complaint.

11

It's Appendix page 20 in Havens -- the complaint asks

12

for the City's expenditures to combat -- to identify

13

specific things, including testers and other -- you

14

know, other enforcement things.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why is this different

16

than the other allegations in Havens that had to do,

17

like here, with lost revenues, with lost tax base, which

18

the Court cited as well?

19

expenditures in terms of increased monitoring of the

20

area by police and other services.

Here there are direct

21

Aren't those City expenditures?

22

MR. KATYAL:

So those -- that's not Havens,

23

Justice Sotomayor, with respect.

24

Gladstone.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think that's

I'm sorry.

Alderson Reporting Company

I apologize.

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

MR. KATYAL:

But -- but -- but our position

2

is that to the extent the City cannot plead a complaint

3

that looks like Gladstone -- and this gets back to

4

Justice Ginsburg's question -- the second bucket in

5

which the City can assert an injury is just like

6

Gladstone in which there is a segregation claim that is

7

being advanced.

8

Realtors were literally steering African-Americans out

9

of the Village.

There was that racial steerers, that

That is an anti-discrimination harm to

10

the Village itself.

11

purposes, Gladstone doesn't talk about proximate cause

12

at all, but for zone-of-interest purposes, there is

13

absolutely nothing wrong with that.

14

has identified --

15

And so for zone-of-interest

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That is, the City

I'm sorry, but you're

16

thinking that if banks are forcing people out of a

17

neighborhood, that that's not discrimination?

18

MR. KATYAL:

Oh, no.

I'm saying that

19

your -- Your Honor, to the extent that that is

20

segregation interest, absolutely it is.

21

Gladstone recognizes.

22

And that's what

Here's what it doesn't recognize though.

It

23

doesn't recognize something like this complaint, which

24

is not that the City is pleading an anti-discrimination

25

interest.

Rather, they are borrowing someone else's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

anti-discrimination interests, namely the discriminatory

2

loans that happen.

3

So look, our position is the direct victims

4

can obviously sue for that, but so too can the Justice

5

Department and HUD, because that's what Congress

6

empowered them to do, to have a version of parens

7

patriae standing.

8
9

But what they are saying is, well, we are
harmed downstream for tax revenues and things like that.

10

That looks very much like the shareholder in Thompson

11

that so concerned this Court.

12

there was not identifying an anti-discrimination injury;

13

they were identifying an economic injury and cutting and

14

pasting the anti-discrimination --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is, the shareholder

But what about Gladstone,

16

which is the case of a village suing?

17

for diminished property values that -- which resulted in

18

loss of revenue.

19

these two cases seem the same to me.

20

their municipality said our tax base has been depleted.

21

The properties have gone way down in value.

22

They were suing

That -- that was -- so to that extent,

MR. KATYAL:

The bottom line,

So, Justice Ginsburg, I think

23

that that's not totally correct for two reasons.

Number

24

one, in Gladstone the injury itself to the Village was

25

an anti-discrimination injury.

That's the first part of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

Gladstone.

2

But here they haven't identified an anti-discrimination

3

harm to the City of Miami.

4

economic harm.

5

the zone of interest, but the one there is.

6

That's found at page 110 of the opinion.

They have identified an

So that's why this case is not within

It looks much -- you can think of it this

7

way:

There are kind of two lodestars in this Court's

8

cases.

9

shareholder who has an economic injury, no doubt they

One is the Thompson shareholder.

The

10

are hurt by an underlying act of discrimination at the

11

front end against someone who is fired, like the CEO who

12

is fired for race discrimination or something like that.

13

But this Court said, a-ha, that opens the door towards

14

way too many lawsuits and landlords --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That was a hypothetical

16

the Court brought up on its own.

17

you put so much weight on Thompson because that was a

18

case that upheld standing.

19

MR. KATYAL:

I'm -- I'm surprised

Oh, absolutely.

And again, our

20

opinion is fully consistent with Thompson.

That is the

21

language in the opinion itself.

22

something Justice Kennedy raised in oral argument and

23

then picked up by Justice Breyer in Thompson.

24

actual language and opinion does talk about

25

shareholders.

It certainly was

And it's not just Thompson.

Alderson Reporting Company

But their

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

This Court's unanimous decision on Lexmark

2

says something much the same about landlords and utility

3

companies, and if you accept their interpretation, you

4

are opening the door not just to the City, but to anyone

5

else who can borrow someone else's anti-discrimination

6

interest, cut and paste it, and --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, is your -- is your

8

concession -- I call it your concession -- your

9

formulation that the City can sue sometimes, are you

10

thinking that the City might be in the same position as

11

Home was in -- was it the -- the Havens case?

12

MR. KATYAL:

So there's two different

13

buckets, and the first bucket -- that was my first

14

answer to Justice Ginsburg -- yes, the City is like

15

Home, the NGO there.

16

concrete interests, the expenditures that they have to

17

outlay to combat a defendant's racial misconduct.

18

so to the extent that a city wants to do that, that's

19

absolutely fine.

20
21
22

They're identifying specific

And

There is a second category of things as
well -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's how you're

23

saying -- and I don't want to foreclose, prevent you

24

from finishing your answer, but are you saying that the

25

City is limited just to the damages that it -- that it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

can recover?

2

MR. KATYAL:

On that theory, in that bucket,

3

yes, they would be limited to the damages.

4

on the second bucket, the segregation --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But, I mean, is it just

6

the costs they incur in trying to --

7

MR. KATYAL:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Just --- eliminate

discrimination?

10
11

They are now

MR. KATYAL:

Just as it is in the NGO in

Havens.

12

Justice Kennedy, I see you're troubled by

13

that, but I point out the second thing is the Gladstone

14

segregation category.

15

City can recover for either -- we will put proximate

16

cause to the side for a second.

17

zone of interest, they can recover for the harms by

18

making an integrated neighborhood become segregated,

19

however marginally that may be.

20

can recover for, as well as, of course, injunctive

21

damages.

22
23
24
25

And in that circumstance, the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But just in terms of

That is something they

But would that be added

police force or something like that?
MR. KATYAL:

No.

I don't think it would

be -- you know, again, that would, I think, run into

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

proximate-cause problems down the road, because there

2

are many steps and causalities that are --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What can the City recover

4

for general damages of having a segregated -- a more

5

segregated community by a result of -- as a result of

6

the defendant's actions?

7

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I think that anything

8

that they can directly outlay, and that may be very hard

9

to identify.

And that's why normally this is done more

10

on the injunctive side, and I think the scheme Congress

11

had implied was to give parens patriae standing to the

12

Justice Department and to HUD to bring these cases --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your -- your

14

concession runs into the same problem as your main

15

argument.

16

having a more segregated environment, that seemed to be

17

measured by all sorts of things, including tourists

18

aren't going to want to visit it as much.

19
20
21

I mean, if -- if the City can recover for

How would you measure the damages if the
harm is simply having a more segregated city?
MR. KATYAL:

I don't know that it runs into

22

the same thing.

I'm making an argument about what this

23

Court's precedence on standing requires starting with

24

the 1990 decision in Lujan which says, a city has to

25

identify -- the words of the opinion is -- his injury.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

So here the City has to identify an

2

anti-discrimination interest that they have suffered.

3

They can't cut and paste and borrow someone else's.

4

to the extent we are talking about, as this complaint

5

does, kind of diminution in tax bases and so on and

6

that's their injury, that is not an anti-discrimination

7

injury.

8

And so the way to reconcile --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So

But, Mr. Katyal, that

10

suggests that when Congress passed the FHA, it was

11

looking only at individual acts of discrimination to

12

particular persons.

13

distinctive kind of anti-discrimination statute, which

14

really is focusing on community harms, and we talked

15

about this a lot in the Texas Housing case of a couple

16

of years ago.

17

harmed; it's communities who are harmed.

18

basic idea of the entire statute, why Congress passed

19

it.

20

But the FHA is a very peculiar and

So it's not just individuals who are
And that's the

And here the cities are standing up and

21

saying, every time you do this redlining and this

22

reverse redlining, essentially a community is becoming

23

blighted.

24

that interest and to assert it.

25

And who better than the City to recognize

MR. KATYAL:

Well, we certainly recognize

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

that that is something that is at issue and one of the

2

goals of the Fair Housing Act, but I think the way

3

Congress dealt with that is not by saying, cities are

4

empowered to have some sort of parens patriae standing.

5

That's what they gave the Justice Department and HUD.

6

And as well, by the way, Justice Kagan, in 3610(f),

7

Congress empowered state and local enforcement over

8

housing discrimination to deal with those types of

9

community-centered problems that you're talking about.

10

But here they are not using any of that.

11

They are coming in and saying, we are a person

12

aggrieved.

13

chapter is entitled, quote, "Enforcement by Private

14

Persons," and our position is --

15

And a person aggrieved in the statute whose

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but they are a person

16

aggrieved under the -- given Congress' purposes in the

17

Act, because they are saying, as you did this redlining,

18

as you did this reverse redlining, our communities, the

19

thing that makes us a city was becoming more and more

20

blighted, and that's what we are trying to recover for,

21

the -- the costs of responding to that, the -- the costs

22

of not having revenues in order to carry out our

23

services for that community and for others.

24

MR. KATYAL:

So, Justice Kagan --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Not parens patriae.

Alderson Reporting Company

This is

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

their own interest in maintaining their communities free

2

of the kind of racial discrimination that the Act says

3

causes neighborhood blight.

4

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Kagan, if the -- if the

5

complaint were written to say that it was about

6

segregation causing blight, we would have no problem

7

with it, which is what I was saying to Justice Ginsburg

8

with respect to zone of interest.

9

within that zone of interest.

The City would fall

That's Gladstone, and

10

that's what the Kerner Commission Report, which you're

11

referring to says, which is, blight is not caused just

12

on its own but it was a result of segregation.

13

references to blight in the Kerner Commission Report

14

follow from segregation.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The

How far out -- how far out

16

would damages extend in -- in the -- the hypothesis you

17

just gave to Justice Kagan?

18

MR. KATYAL:

So -- so for zone of interest,

19

I think, you know, you're able to get -- I don't think

20

it matters, that is, to the extent that the City can --

21

the complaint by the City pleads a segregation harm.

22

Even if it's downstream, they are within the zone of

23

interest.

24

Now to turn to proximate cause, though --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.

Alderson Reporting Company

I guess I don't

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

understand why this isn't a segregation harm.

2

City is saying, you've done this redlining; you've done

3

this reverse redlining.

4

various foreclosures all over the City; it's causing

5

foreclosures in particular concentrated areas, and it's

6

doing that because of racial segregation.

7

Here, the

It's not that it just causes

And at the same time, it's preventing that

8

racial segregation from ever being lifted because those

9

communities are becoming more and more blighted and less

10

and less capable of becoming integrated communities.

11

everything about this complaint is about racial

12

segregation, it seems to me.

13

MR. KATYAL:

So

Justice Kagan, I'd encourage

14

you to just look back at what you just said and then

15

read it against their complaint, because none of that's

16

in the complaint.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So do you think everything I

18

just said, if their complaint was written like that,

19

that they could maintain a suit?

20

MR. KATYAL:

They could maintain a suit for

21

segregation.

And the measure of damages wouldn't be the

22

measure of damages which they're seeking, which is

23

recovery for the 2008 foreclosure crisis in Miami and to

24

the tune of billions of dollars nationwide.

25

be, again, at most -- and I want to get to proximate

Alderson Reporting Company

It would

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

cause -- it would be at most the delta between a

2

segregated community that had -- now exists as a result

3

of the defendant's particular conduct and an integrated

4

community that would have existed otherwise.

5

be the only measure of damages.

6
7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How -- how do you

measure that?

8
9

That would

MR. KATYAL:

I'm not sure.

And that's why I

do think ultimately it may fail on proximate cause.

But

10

at least we're -- we've been talking so far about zone

11

of interest, and that's, of course, all Gladstone dealt

12

with was zone of interest.

13

And with respect to zone of interest, I

14

think that that complaint, the one that, Justice Kagan,

15

you read, would satisfy zone of interest.

16

allow at least a city to come in and get injunctive

17

relief to try and preserve the kind of

18

community-centered concepts that you're talking about.

19

It would

Now, the question is, would they be able to

20

recover damages for that, including damages to the

21

diminution of their tax base?

22

Justice Ginsburg, that Gladstone has that line at the

23

end of page 110 which talks about diminution of tax

24

revenues.

25

for Article III standing.

It's certainly true,

The next line is, of course, that's enough

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

So I don't think this Court has ever decided

2

the question of whether or not proximate-cause

3

principles allow a segregation lawsuit to extend so far.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your answer aimed at

5

Gladstone would be, I take it from everything you said,

6

that Gladstone would flunk at the proximate-cause stage?

7

MR. KATYAL:

So I do think that that's

8

right; that is, there would be so many steps involved --

9

and you could just take a look at this complaint.

And

10

if you look at the Solicitor General's brief for page --

11

brief at page 30, you see all the steps that are

12

required before the City is injured.

13

You have to have discriminatory loans.

14

Those discriminatory loans have to lead to defaults.

15

The defaults have to lead to foreclosures.

16

foreclosures need to lead to increase in vacancies.

17

increase in vacancies needs to lead to reduction in

18

property values.

it.

20

The
The

And then that is supposed to reduce

I usually think of

proximate cause -- correct me if I'm wrong -- as a

22

question of liability, not damages -- Palsgraf.

23

liability.

24

MR. KATYAL:

Correct.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No

So it isn't --

So it wasn't a question of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

damages.

2

liability and damages?

3

But you say proximate cause bears on both

MR. KATYAL:

I do.

I think that this Court

4

has kind of thought about it that way.

5

for example, at Lexmark, and has said -- you know, I

6

think what this Court has said is you look to the

7

underlying damages that are being sought to understand.

8

Is the complaint within the kind of standard

9

proximate-cause principles?

10

You could think,

And here, if you accept their theory, that

11

chain, you'll be doing something I don't know that this

12

Court has ever done before, which is to allow such a

13

long chain of causation, a non-direct cause of -- chain

14

of causation to the tune of, again, billions of dollars

to recover from the --

against that backdrop.

to mean that the language means it stretches to the

Why shouldn't we understand that

MR. KATYAL:

For three reasons, Justice

Kagan.

9

The first is that, at most, the

10

congressional ratification doctrine only applies to

11

holdings of the Court, not that -- I know you weren't on

12

the Court for Thompson, but a lot of the rest of us were

13

here.

15

And in Thompson, the Court unanimously -JUSTICE KAGAN:

actually anticipating the reverse.

No, no, absolutely not.

I was

the Court went through this.

to the limits and binding holdings and what this Court

said --

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They heard the Solicitor

I guess I don't understand.

24

I mean, we can argue about whether these were holdings

25

and whether these were a dicta, and there are arguments

on both sides of that.

2

But here I am on Congress.

14
15

Don't worry.

And he says, okay.

I feel relieved.

We can

now use this language.

16

I mean, wouldn't you be fired?

17

MR. KATYAL:

Well, Your -- Your Honor, I

18

think I'd be fired if I did what you said, which is not

19

actually follow what this Court's cases require, which

20

is, quote, "An express negation of the zone-of-interest

21

test," not borrowing from some, you know, implicit

22

doctrine.

23

Because at its high water mark, this Court

24

has said in Jama:

"The congressional ratification

25

doctrine is only a guide to word what Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22

2

implicitly thought."
And at least starting in 1983 in the Block

3

case -- and I think even going before that in the AGC

4

case, perhaps going even before that -- this Court has

5

said, you need an express negation by Congress in order

6

to abrogate the zone-of-interest test.

7
8
9

And that is just not what happened here.

At

most, it was borrowing -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Strange -- strange

10

development, because the zone-of-interest test, at least

11

as it was announced in data processing, was understood

12

to expand standing over what it had been before.

13

zone-of-interest test was that, having in standing, it

14

was facilitating the ability to bring lawsuits.

15

MR. KATYAL:

Well, certainly.

So the

But by the

16

time of Block, which was a case about limiting

17

standing -- and that was before 1988, so I think you've

18

got that problem.

19

You'd also be fired, Justice Kagan, for

20

another reason in your hypothetical, which is the

21

Congressional Report that you wrote, the House Report,

22

as a staffer, says, you know, there's only two things

23

that you were trying to codify:

24

25

administrative and judicial standing applies the same

Those are the only two things in the House

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't read the -- the

House Report that way.

5

couple of particular aspects of those cases.

6

House Report seems to me to cut against you because it

7

makes clear that Congress knew about those cases.

8

those cases are, of course, the cases which said that

9

standing stretches to the limits of Article III.

10

The House Report does refer to a
But the

And

And if you really look at the legislative

11

history of this Act, it's pretty clear that when

12

Congress is acting in 1988, it took off the shelf a bill

13

that was discussed in 1980.

14

a lot of discussion about whether standing should go to

15

the limits of Article III.

changing that language.

17

And in that bill, there was

And Drew Days, the Assistant Attorney

General for Civil Rights, and the HUD Secretary, they

both come in and they tell Congress, if you change that

20

language, it's a problem, because then you're cutting

21

back on standing.

22

that language because it wanted, as Drew Days said and

23

as the HUD Secretary said, to go to the limits of

24

Article III.

25

And Congress decided not to change

MR. KATYAL:

I'll answer that, and then I'd

like to turn to proximate cause.

2

So, Justice Kagan, even if all of that is

3

true, I think this Court has insisted on an express

4

negation for precisely this reason, so that you don't go

tap Drew Days and what -- have to --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Katyal, this is not

7

an express -- an express limitation that means we're

not -- we're doing away or we are keeping the zone of

10

that rule.

the zone of interests.

15

There was no explicit statement.

What the

Here, we have a Congress in 1988 taking the

word "aggrieved," which was in the -- in Title VII and

take the definition looked at by prior regulations,

examined by this Court in its three cases establishing

"aggrieved" that is very different from the normal

definition.

MR. KATYAL:

MR. KATYAL:

And what it did was

you is this:

that liability is cut off after the first step.

This Court, in Lexmark, said there is a

21

something that is way, way beyond anything this Court

22

has insisted on.

23

At most, this Court, in

But here, this Court -- or this complaint

JUSTICE KAGAN:

When you say that -- when

24

you said to me that the complaints that I wrote would

have been covered by the Act, do you think it also would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26

fall within proximate-cause principles?

2

MR. KATYAL:

I -- I think that the -- the

3

requirement.

5

identify segregation -- segregation harms directly, in

6

the way that maybe a university could when they

7

become -- you know, when they lose diversity or

something like that.

So to the extent that the City could

And, of course, Congress could write a

12

statute that enables something and abrogate the

13

traditional proximate-cause doctrine.

14

haven't done any of that.

15

again, a kind of plain Jane version of damages.

16

what they're seeking here with this creative

17

complaint -- which, you know, the Fair Housing Act has

18

been around since before I was born, and only until a

19

couple of years ago have we ever seen a complaint that

20

looks anything like this.

21

But here they

Here they have applied,
And

Here they're seeking to recover for the

22

foreclosure crisis of 2008.

That can't possibly satisfy

23

proximate-cause principles starting with Justice Holmes'

24

opinion in Southern Pacific in 1918, going all the way

25

to the Holmes opinion of this Court just more recently.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

So you've got kind of Holmes and Holmes.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But is one understanding --

3

like, I guess, when I started reading the briefs, I was

4

confused about this, because there's one understanding

5

of proximate cause, which is that usually proximate

6

cause is about foreseeability and only foreseeability.

7

Now, there are definitely places where we've

8

said there's this additional directness requirement, but

9

only in pretty discrete areas.

And I guess I -- like I

10

sort of come back to this notion that I think what our

11

-- our precedent suggests is it's a little bit statute

12

by statute as to whether proximate cause is a

13

foreseeability inquiry and only that, or whether it has

14

additional components.

15
16

MR. KATYAL:

I'll -- I'll answer that, and

then if I could reserve the balance of my time.

17

I think this Court in Paroline said, quote,

18

"The proximate cause generally falls to the basic

19

requirement, there must be a direct relationship between

20

the injury asserted and the injurious conduct."

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. KATYAL:

both do that.

24

rule.

25

So --

I think Paroline and Lexmark

That is the general rule, not the outlier

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do we do with

Alderson Reporting Company

all of the statements in Havens?

is little significance in the difference between direct

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3
4
5

MR. PECK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The City of Miami brought this -- these

6

cases seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages

7

because the banks' practice of providing minority

8

borrowers with more expensive and riskier loans than

9

they qualified for, or that nonminority borrowers

10

received, actually frustrated and counteracted the

11

City's efforts on fair housing, and -- and tended to --

12

to cause the City to lose the benefits of social,

13

professional, and business opportunities that come with

14

an integrated community free from housing

15

discrimination.

16

Now, you heard my friend describe these as

17

two buckets, that if the complaint makes that out

18

clearly, then we do have standing that we fit within the

19

zone of interests.

20

complaint that we filed made this apparent.

21

Eleventh Circuit agreed with us.

We thought that the original
The

But when the district court dismissed us

23

with prejudice on the original complaint, we made a

24

motion for reconsideration to try to make more explicit

25

30

As a result, the Court did deny us the

opportunity to do that.

3

complaint, it does talk about the fact that the City

4

operates a Department of Community and Economic

5

Development which takes complaints about fair housing,

6

that tries to mediate it, that counsels, that educates

7

citizens about it, and is in charge of all these kinds

8

of efforts that we thought were part of our original

9

complaint.

10

But if you look at that amended

At the same time, we recognize that the

11

injury to the City is one that comes from the -- the

12

failure to fall into the nondiscrimination principles

13

embodied in the Fair Housing Act.

14

buckets do exist in this complaint.

15

then they do exist if we had the opportunity to amend

16

the complaint and make it even more explicit.

17

And --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so those two
And if they don't,

I'm looking at the Joint

19

Appendix, page 186, your opening paragraph where you

20

say, "BoA's conduct has harmed the residents of Miami

21

and impaired the" -- "the City's strong, long-standing,

22

and active commitment to open integrated residential

23

housing patterns and its attendant benefits of creating

24

a stable community -- community."

25

And then you go on to the specific damages,

the loss of tax revenues, and increased expenses.

2
3

It's those types of allegations in your
amended complaint that you're pointing to?

4

MR. PECK:

I -- I point to those.

I point

5

to those on -- on 232 and 233, which describe the

6

regardless of whether you take the Article III approach

15

to standing in this case, or take a more narrow

16

formulation that depends on the fact that we -- our

aggrievement is tied to violations of the Act, the City

of Miami has standing.

Now, one thing that my friend also said was

that we are seeking billions.

we -- we mention the fact that we had lost millions, not

hundreds of millions, not billions in property taxes.

10

Now, in our complaint

We note that before the City of Miami

11

brought its case, the cities of Memphis and Baltimore

12

both brought cases, and they ended up settling cases

13

with identical types of allegations for less than

14

10 million each.

15

of money that --

16

So we are not talking about huge sums

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, presumably one

17

of the issues factored into the settlement was the

18

question that's presented today.

19

if you had prevailed they wouldn't have to give up a

20

percentage on the possibility that they might not be

21

stating a claim.

22

MR. PECK:

In other words, if --

You know, it's possible.

At that

23

point I don't believe anyone had raised proximate cause

24

as a separate issue, but the cities had survived

25

multiple motions to dismiss that went to the zone of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

interest, so that is what caused other cities to see the

2

survival of that and the settlement of those cases as a

3

possibility to prove these cases.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Peck, would you go

5

back to the question the Chief started with, which is,

6

how do you define the limits of your foresee --

7

foreseeability tests?

8

tax.

9

foreseeable, but you're suggesting they are not

Clearly less tourism.

Less sales

Less of a lot of other things can be potentially

10

recoverable.

11

or is it because they are not measurable?

12

So is it because they are not foreseeable

MR. PECK:

I think they are difficult to

13

measure.

And they -- they may be foreseeable, but I

14

think that also there is the potential for superseding

15

events that cut off the causal chain there.

16

But here when you --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You want us to use the

18

word, the phrase, the concept "proximate cause" in

19

determining how far damages extend?

20

MR. PECK:

You know, I -- I think it -- it

21

provides some help, but not a great deal of help.

22

In Lexmark, for example --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24
25

So -- so what -- where do

I turn next?
MR. PECK:

Well, you know -- you know, in

prohibits discrimination in housing, and this is one of

9

the damages that we suffer that is directly from -- the

10

result of these kinds of home loans.

11

we've -- we've tried to cabin our damages with respect

12

to these specific properties and -- and we -- damages

13

that they generate directly to the City.

sufficient connection between the alleged misconduct and

injuries are the injuries that this -- this Court

22

recognized.

23

So here we have injuries that the
My friend doesn't

So the question then becomes what's

24

appropriate damages?

We think we have proposed damages

25

that are tightly connected to the actual injury that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

City has suffered.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do we have to go into that,

3

or not?

4

but I mean, do we have to to decide this case, decide

5

the damages, what damages are appropriate?

6

I'm not -- not saying we should or shouldn't,

MR. PECK:

You do not need to decide that.

7

In fact, one of the things that the Eleventh Circuit

8

noted is that in the time between when the briefs were

9

written and when we argued the case, this Court came

10

down with the decision in Inclusive Communities, and in

11

that decision, the Court's mentioned that there is a

12

proximate-cause pleading standard that needs to be

13

incorporated.

14

going to delve into what that exactly is and remand it

15

to the district court for that decision.

16

that that -- that can play out in -- in the further

17

litigation of this lawsuit.

18

And the Eleventh Circuit said, we are not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And we think

So if we include

19

language along the lines that don't worry, it's not

20

going to be very much based on the experience in -- in

21

Baltimore and -- and Memphis?

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. PECK:

Well, I just think that the --

24

you know, the fact that our -- our opponents have

25

indicated that we are talking about billions and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

billions of dollars and that this is about the 2008

2

financial crisis, which I also want to deny, needed a

3

response.

4

And -- and -- and with respect to the

5

financial crisis, if -- if the 2008 financial crisis

6

was, indeed, the purpose of this lawsuit, then the

7

statute of limitations, which is two years, would

8

have -- would have ended this lawsuit a long time ago.

9

But instead what we found, and what the

10

Eleventh Circuit acknowledged, is that while the kinds

11

of loans -- the financial crisis was set off by subprime

12

lending.

13

here have taken different forms, but the underlying

14

practice remains the same, that minority borrowers are

15

getting more expensive and riskier loans that are

16

quicker to foreclosure, and -- and that foreclosure may

17

be as many, for some minorities, seven times as

18

frequently as the non-minority borrowers.

19

But the kinds of loans that are being offered

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there -- is there

20

a difference?

21

not clear to me, anyway, between subprime loans and

22

predatory loans.

23

I couldn't -- the -- the complaint was

MR. PECK:

You -- predatory loans are used

24

as sort of a generic term to talk about a taking

25

advantage of a borrower.

Subprime loans are -- are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

simply those loans that have interest rates that are so

2

low that it looks like it's a wonderful deal until, of

3

course, you look at some of -- some of the balloon

4

payments that are later --

5
6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So are all -- all

subprime loans properly categorized as predatory?

7

MR. PECK:

I believe that the subprime loans

8

that -- that fueled the financial crisis are all

9

considered predatory.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose you have a

11

business that -- that is losing money, losing employees,

12

because the neighborhood is deteriorating.

13

14

15

neighborhood has been debilitated.

16
17

MR. PECK:

Do they have
They

I think they have a weaker claim.

We have a claim that's tied to the fact --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MR. PECK:

They are property owners.

They are property owners, but

20

they're also commercial property owners.

21

22

property.

23

And -- and

But -- but here what we are saying is --

Species Act, this Court in Bennett v. Spears, recognized

Alderson Reporting Company

The Endangered

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

that Article III standing applies to the Endangered

2

Species Act, but you still have to make a claim that's

3

based on an interest in the preservation of animals.

4

You can't make a claim based on discrimination as --

5

that applies to housing discrimination or something like

6

that.

7

ties the statute to the cause of action.

There is some generalized zone of interest that

Here I say that the City has a special
interest in fair housing and an integrated community

10

that the FHA is designed to vindicate.

11

does not.

12

have this unique relationship to the fact that this is

13

their community, their neighborhoods, their residents,

14

which they zone, and they decide how the property is

15

supposed to be used, and they provide services to every

16

one of these residents, and so, therefore --

17

The employer

The local dry cleaner does not.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, they

But wouldn't the

18

business owner have an interest in running his business

19

in an integrated vibrant neighborhood just as the City

20

would have, I would say, a less direct interest in

21

having that neighborhood preserved in the City?

22

MR. PECK:

You know, it may be so that a

23

particular business does have that interest.

24

think that it's very difficult to -- to claim the kinds

25

of damages that you've claimed.

Alderson Reporting Company

But I

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

Remember, one difference between the FHA

2

and -- and Title VII, for example, is that we recognize

3

indirect harms.

4

organizations, and cities, and developers, and real

5

estate brokers, all to sue to vindicate that interest.

6

We allow neighbors, testers, nonprofit

We don't allow the -- the equivalent of a

7

neighbor, a co-worker, to bring an action for

8

discrimination that's been visited upon one of their

9

colleagues.

We don't allow others within that kind of

10

realm to bring these actions.

11

of the problem that a business that makes this claim

12

might have.

13

And I think that's part

So in the end, what I'm -- I'm suggesting is

14

that there are direct injuries by virtue of these two

15

what -- what my friend describes as buckets.

16

injury to the City in its efforts to secure fair housing

17

by draining those resources, and those resources are

18

recoverable, and that that, indeed, satisfies any kind

19

of proximate cause, as well as an injury to that

20

interest in an integrated community that allows the

21

business opportunities, the social opportunities, the

22

professional opportunities to flow that this Court

23

recognized in the Gladstone case and suggested that the

24

appropriate -- and even my friend in his brief suggested

25

the appropriate damages in such an instance is the loss

Alderson Reporting Company

A direct

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

of property value and property taxes, which, frankly,

2

are part and parcel of this whole mortgage loan

3

industry.

4

So we are not asking for something that's

5

different, that's out of the realm, that's away from

6

what this process is.

7

that process.

8
9

But something that's integral to

So in the end what we suggest is the City of
Miami is not so marginally involved in Fair Housing, is

10

not working inconsistently, and its injuries are so fair

11

afield from it that we are outside the zone of interest,

12

whatever zone of interest applies, because, after all,

13

it's not a very demanding test.

14

for that, and that's because we are aggrieved in every

15

sense of the word by the discrimination that was

16

propounded here.

17

And there is a reason

And at the same time, we think that that

18

statement from Lexmark that I quoted earlier -- that it

19

has to essentially flow from the fact that there was

20

some violation of the Act, is it sufficient too?

21

each instance, we think our -- our injury is direct, but

22

even if it were to be examined more minutely, as my

23

friend suggests, those minute steps are all true of the

24

individual borrower who has to take out a discriminatory

25

loan, who has to then default, who has to then arrive

Alderson Reporting Company

And in

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

in -- in foreclosure, who has to find that he has to

2

abandon that house, and then he can bring that lawsuit

3

still, because all those different steps are -- you

4

know, the -- the -- the financial state of the economy,

5

the -- the nature of his job situation, his family

6

situation, all have effects on that.

7

that this is proximately caused -- his damages are

8

proximately caused from the injury that the Fair Housing

9

Act recognizes.

10
11

But we recognize

So for those reasons, I suggest that this
Court ought to affirm the Eleventh Circuit.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

15

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

16

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

17
18
19

MR. GANNON:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Gladstone, this Court concluded that a

20

municipality was injured if discriminatory housing

21

practices caused a reduction in property values and,

22

therefore, diminished its tax revenues.

23

recodified that result with its 1988 amendments to the

24

Fair Housing Act, and the Court should hold that the

25

same injury is still cognizable today, whether an

Alderson Reporting Company

Congress

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

Article III rationale or a broad zone-of-interest

2

rationale.

3

If I could turn to some of the points that

4

have already come up today, my friend on the other side

5

says that you can't cut and paste injury from one

6

plaintiff to -- one victim of discrimination to another.

7

That's an argument that Gladstone specifically rejected.

8
9

In Footnote 9 the Court said that what
matters here, and this is what was -- this is what was

10

the breadth of the trilogy of Fair Housing Act cases

11

that the Court decided between 1972 and 1982, is that

12

somebody has had their legal rights violated by

13

discriminatory housing practices.

14

necessarily have to be the plaintiff's legal rights.

15

The plaintiff has to be injured by that violation, but

16

it doesn't have to be their rights that are violated.

17

And that's what we think is the -- is the work that's

18

being done by the atypical definition of "aggrieved

19

person" that Congress put back into the statute --

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It doesn't

21

statement, Mr. Gannon.

22

restaurant or the dry cleaner or the laundry or whatever

23

that wants to sue for somebody else's discrimination?

24
25

MR. GANNON:

What do you do, then, with the

Well, I agree with my friends

on both sides that that limit is going to come from the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

proximate-cause analysis.

2

is still a proximate-cause limitation implicit in the

3

statutes.

4

We don't disagree that there

And here we think that although Gladstone

5

didn't address proximate cause in those terms, it is

6

important and significant that the Court there said that

7

the City is directly injured by the decrease in property

8

values, and we think that the test -- the ultimate test

9

that this Court stated in Lexmark -- of course, the

10

Court has repeatedly recognized that proximate cause is

11

a statute-by-statute situational inquiry that depends

12

upon the nature of the individual statutes, but the

13

ultimate test is whether there is a sufficiently close

14

connection to the conduct that the statute prohibits.

15

And what this statute prohibits is discriminatory

16

housing practices.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

You may not need to go into

18

it, but how does proximate cause help you?

21

about this community before it got wrecked or whatever.

that what we are saying --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. GANNON:

6

into the Home framework from Havens, then maybe they

7

could say that they have specific costs that are

8

associated with fighting discrimination.

9

But I wanted to say that what we have --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

what the question was -- the question before and it

12

still is -- if we get into it -- we may not need to, but

lawsuit?

19

And it's a prime example, absolutely
Can he bring this

I mean -MR. GANNON:

And I -- we -- we think -- no.

20

We think that -- we think that that is further afield,

21

and we think that --

22
23

JUSTICE BREYER:

You think it's further

afield --

24

MR. GANNON:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the --- not because of causation

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

though, because it's caused.

2

where we proved that it's caused.

3

MR. GANNON:

I made a hypothetical

Yes, it's caused.

But

4

proximate cause is always about determining that

5

something that is caused is still too far away, either

6

in terms of foreseeability or distance or intervening

7

cause or something else, and so proximate cause by

8

definition is carving out something that otherwise would

9

be caused by.

10

Otherwise, it wouldn't be doing anything

different from traceability analysis under Article III.

11

And here we think that the reason why this

12

is sufficiently closely connected to the conduct that

13

the statute prohibits is that this statute prohibits

14

discriminatory housing practices, and those practices

15

include things like the terms and conditions of the sale

16

of rental property; things about the real estate-related

17

transactions; things like block busting, which was

18

specifically prohibited by 3604(e).

19

was a practice by which somebody would go into a

20

neighborhood and induce artificially low-priced panic

21

selling by saying there are minorities coming into this

22

neighborhood.

23

prices.

24
25

And block busting

That conduct had an effect on property

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

that possibility.

5

has standing and its injuries are proximately caused,

6

but those people don't?

10

I doubt someone who is

Why -- how do we write that the City

I think -The company shareholder.

What's -- how do we say it?
MR. GANNON:

The link that we see is -- is

11

to property value, and that's the injury that the Court

12

already recognized in Gladstone.

13

This is a question of congressional intent.

14

When you're -- when you're construing proximate cause,

15

you're trying to figure out what Congress intended.

16

This Court had already recognized that a city was

17

directly injured by decreased property value.

18

thing it said was true of the neighbors in Gladstone.

19

The neighbors that had their property values diminished

20

were able to recover.

The same

21

I would say that the corner store, to the

22

extent that it has its property values diminished, is

23

situated just like one of those neighbors.

profits or the utility company is complaining they lost

values is closely tied to discriminatory housing

practices.

one-to-one relationship --

15

Congress was entitled to think that that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How about real estate

16

brokers whose commission is based on the value of the

17

property?

18

MR. GANNON:

Yes.

Real estate brokers who

19

are involved in the transaction, we discussed in our

20

brief that those are the type of people who have an

21

interest in the transaction, even if it's just an

22

economic interest, they're able to recover.

23

understand my friends on the other side to be disputing

24

that, that -- that if they have a transaction that fails

25

to go through because of this, because of racial

Alderson Reporting Company

I don't

Official - Subject to Final Review

51

discrimination, then they can sue.

2

And we think it is important for the Court

3

to remind -- remember that you don't just to have to

4

have --

5

They said this -- this is now a poor

7

community.

8

10

MR. GANNON:

I -- I think that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They are -- they're

11

somehow different from the corner grocery store?

12

don't get it.

13
14

MR. GANNON:

No.

I

I think if -- if they were

just generically saying business is done --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. GANNON:

That is my hypothetical.

That might be harder for them

17

to establish the types of cases that -- that we've

18

previously seen are where developers, brokers, real

19

estate -- real estate agents have -- have talked about

20

specific transactions that they can say were caused

21

by -- by discriminatory housing practices.

22

do think it is important for the Court to recall that

23

those cases involve plaintiffs who don't necessarily

24

have a, quote/unquote, "desegregation interest," as

25

my -- as my friend on the other side puts it.

Alderson Reporting Company

And it -- we

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

It -- it is enough that they are injured in

2

their economic interests, and as the Court pointed out

3

in Inclusive Communities, a real estate developer is

4

often a good plaintiff to challenge a local

5

discriminatory housing practice.

6

they add on that they are -- they are something like the

7

nonprofit in Havens where, in addition to wanting to

8

make money off of developing their property, they also

9

have an interest in desegregation.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We don't require that

And similarly --

So your answer --

Perhaps -- please.
Your answer, I think, to

13

the question is that it's limited to those cognizable

14

suits contemplated by the statute, and you see

15

contemplated by the statute as having to do with the

16

possession or value of the property?

17

MR. GANNON:

We think that the -- the harms

18

that flow directly from changes in property value were

19

ones that Congress contemplated, both in 1968, and

20

certainly in 1988, after this Court had already -- had

21

already enumerated that as a particular type of harm

22

that was at issue here.

23

And we don't think that the City should have

24

to establish that there's been a change in racial

25

composition of the neighborhood in order to bring a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

suit, because the Fair Housing Act is intended to

2

cover -- is intended to prohibit discriminatory housing

3

practices throughout the United States, and that

4

includes segregated communities that aren't changing if

5

there is discrimination.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

based on isolated instances of discrimination?

8

MR. GANNON:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the City can sue

To the extent -I thought that the

10

basic pitch of the -- of your position is that it

11

affects the community as a whole, and the City has an

12

interest in ensuring the stability of the communities,

13

not that the City could enforce particular instances of

14

housing discrimination.

15

MR. GANNON:

I -- I think it's both.

I

16

think that they do have the community representing

17

interest, and -- but I also think that, to the extent

18

that they can say we suffer a harm from this particular

19

transaction -- let's assume it's just one particular

20

apartment complex or something.

21
22
23

If --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could be one -- one

particular home?
MR. GANNON:

Yeah.

I suspect that that's

24

one where there wouldn't be that much in it to have the

25

City bring that suit instead of the individual loan

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

54
1

owner, but --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

there's that much in it.

4

or not?

5

MR. GANNON:

I don't know if

Can the City bring that action

Yes.

It -- to the extent that

6

they can say there is a one-to-one relationship, they

7

are just like the microchip manufacturer in Lexmark.

8

Whenever there is a decline in property value on the

9

part of the -- the primary victim, or the homeowner

10

here, they suffer a corresponding decline in their tax

11

revenue.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the City can

13

bring an action of the sort we're talking about here in

14

the case of one subprime mortgage that results in a

15

foreclosure?

16

MR. GANNON:

If they can say that that --

17

that's -- that that was caused by discriminatory housing

18

practices --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

MR. GANNON:

Yes.

-- and that it injured them?

21

Yes.

That's just like the -- the residents in

say, we are injured by this.

So I think it will be hard, and that's why I don't think

3

he had an answer, Justice Breyer, on the magazine, or

4

things like that.

5

And then, Justice Sotomayor, you asked him

6

how to write the opinion to avoid the gardener, and his

7

answer was, look at Gladstone, because Gladstone has a

8

direct reduction in property values.

9

consistent theory for this Court on proximate-cause

That cannot be a

10

principles for many reasons, one of which Gladstone is

11

not a proximate-cause case at all.

12

argued.

13

It's not briefed or

But second, even the language he's reading

14

to you is only at the very end of Gladstone, saying that

15

if you have a reduction in property value, then it will

16

directly reduce the tax base.

17

This complaint's totally different.

You've

18

got five steps, as the Solicitor General's own brief

19

explains, before you even get to the reduction in

20

property value.

21

intervening causes, and all the kinds of things that

22

this Court in Lexmark said are the reasons why we cut

23

off liability at the first step.

24
25

Each of those are opportunities for

Now, his other answer was to say, well, look
at the Congressional Report.

The Congressional Report

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57

identifies that Congress was concerned with property

2

values, and therefore concerned with cities.

3

That Congressional Report also says Congress

4

was equally concerned with employers who suffered from

5

segregated neighborhoods, employees who were fired

6

because the neighborhoods suffered from blight, and

7

shops and other things.

8
9

So if you take their standard, which is,
look at the Congressional Report, figure out who's

10

harmed by housing discrimination, even downstream, you

11

would come to the same conclusion we do, which is this

12

is an unlimited theory of liability.

13

landlords to sue, utilities companies to sue, and,

14

Justice Sotomayor, gardeners to sue.

15

It would allow

We've also said one other thing, Justice

16

Kagan.

This gets to your point earlier about the

17

congressional scheme.

18

their interpretation of "aggrieved persons," 3612 allows

19

"aggrieved persons" to intervene as a matter of right in

20

Federal litigation.

If you adopt on zone of interest

21

Our view is what Congress did was it

22

empowered direct victims to sue, as well as some

23

indirect victims, in the Justice Department.

24

interpretation says, any city, including one that's not

25

even motivated by the same type of, you know, presumably

Alderson Reporting Company

Their

Official - Subject to Final Review

wonderful motivations as the City of Miami, can come in

2

and intervene in a direct victims lawsuit and possibly

3

muck it up in any number of directions.

4

possibly be what Congress thought about when they have

5

used the words "person aggrieved" in the statute, to

6

allow cities to come in and interfere with -- with a --

7

kind of lawsuits filed by direct victims.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10
11

That can't

Well, it's hard to think

that Congress didn't know that in 1988, when we've
already let a village come in, in a municipality.
MR. KATYAL:

But, Justice Sotomayor, our

12

position on this -- and this is very important -- we're

13

not quibbling with that.

14

percent good law.

15

They're the ones that are seeking to expand it in two

16

directions, both by taking it out of segregation and by

17

expanding proximate cause to the sky.

Gladstone is absolutely 100

We're not seeking to change it.
