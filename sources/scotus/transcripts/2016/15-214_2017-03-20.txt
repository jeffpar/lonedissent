ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. GROEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. GROEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The fundamental unfairness in this case is

12

illustrated by one fact:

13

other than the Murr siblings, owned Lot E, that owner

14

could sell or develop it.

If anyone else in the world,

But the Murrs cannot.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Groen, may I ask -Let me ask you this

17

question.

18

Suppose that three years from now lots such as these two

19

lots in the same ownership become immensely more

20

valuable than the two lots singly.

21

would be worth a hundred thousand, but these lots where

22

you can build a bigger home are worth $500,000.

23

It's a hypothetical.

It's not this case.

Each lot singly

The county wants a fire -- fire station and

24

it takes Lot E.

25

theory?

What do they pay for it under your

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. GROEN:

They should pay for --

compensation for the taking of Lot E.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Any taking --

Which is $100,000.

So

4

under your hypothetical, property owners stand to lose

5

$300,000 under my hypothetical and your answer.

6
7

MR. GROEN:

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The hypothetical is

together, they are worth 500,000; singly, they're worth
a hundred thousand each.

11
12

Under the

hypothetical --

8
9

No, I don't think so.

What is the amount that the -- the county
has to pay to take Lot E for the fire station?

13

MR. GROEN:

The analysis must begin with

14

defining the relevant parcel that's the subject of the

15

case analysis.

16
17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
Lot E only.

18

MR. GROEN:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20
21

And in your view, that's

only.

That's right.
And they pay $100,000

That's it.
MR. GROEN:

The land owner would have the

22

burden of proving that there are additional damages that

23

they should be compensated for.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
severance damages.

But the presumption --

You indicated there's no

You're taking the entire parcel.

MR. GROEN:

You're taking all of Lot E, and

they should be paid compensation for Lot E.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

MR. GROEN:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's right.

Whether that compensation is -That's $100,000 that go

6

under your theory, land owners in the hypothetical that

7

I put up would lose money and the State would be --

8

would be getting the windfall.

9

MR. GROEN:

If that hypothetical does not

10

include any integrated economic use between those two

11

parcels; that is correct.

12

determined by the lot that is taken.

13

The compensation is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the integrated -- the

14

integrated use is determined by the market.

15

your theory completely ignores market factors.

16

MR. GROEN:

Your --

And that is exactly what the

17

government would argue is that the compensation must be

18

limited to the parcel that is taken.

19

domain law, which is the -- the hypothetical that you're

20

providing, in eminent domain law, the presumption is

21

exactly that:

22

taken, unless that presumption can be overcome by the

23

landowner proving that the two parcels are actually --

24

yes, there's a unity of use between the two --

25

And in eminent

then why isn't that true here?

3

MR. GROEN:

Then why doesn't that

It supports the theory.

It's

4

the exact same principle, only in reverse.

5

the government limiting compensation to just the parcel

6

taken, here the government is saying we want to combine

7

the values of the two in order to find there's no

taking.

the presumption of determining what is the relevant

Rather than

But in both scenarios, you have to begin with

scenarios, either eminent domain or inverse

MR. GROEN:

clarifying question about your argument?

17

things that makes this case odd is that there are family

18

members all around.

19

and the buyers are the -- but if I'm right, your

20

argument would extend in the exact same way to a

situation where you have two sellers who are completely

Am I right about your argument?

3

MR. GROEN:

4

Well, I'm not sure which parcel

your -- your hypothetical is talking about.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

MR. GROEN:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You have --

But -- but -- but
-- two preexisting

8

substandard parcels.

9

all the parties are independent of each other.

Somebody comes in, buys both, but

10

MR. GROEN:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Each parcel.

Right --

And now the person who has

12

bought these two standard -- substandard lots wants to

13

build on them, and your argument would be the exact

14

same.

15

MR. GROEN:

That -- that's right.

They're

16

each independent, discrete, and separate parcels.

17

the grandfather clause that is attached with this

18

land-use ordinance would protect the development and

19

sale rights of each parcel independently.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

So where does

21

regulatory -- a State's regulatory power come in?

22

This -- Justice Kagan put in a hypothetical to --

23

to this one owner owns two parcels or two different

24

people own two parcels, and they sell it to your one

25

owner.

And the one owner knows the regulation says if

develop on one, if they're both below an acre or

3

whatever the rule is.

4

your expectations as a buyer.

5

MR. GROEN:

Your rule would just do away with

Well, no.

The -- in that

6

situation, the fact that someone might know that there

7

-- there are regulations on properties does not change

8

the time of the taking.

9

the regulations redefined the property rights, and that

to State law, let's look to State law, the whole ball of

wax.

According to State law, they are one lot.

In defining property interests,

11

Roth and this Court in Lucas note 7 both recognized that

you look to the State law, not to the whole body of

State law, you look to the State law that governs the

14

creation that's the legal recognition of lots and the

15

protection of the property interest.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I -- I think that

17

you're right, Mr. Groen.

It's like the legal

18

recognition of property.

But the legal recognition of

19

property has something to do with lot lines, and it also

20

has something to do with when lots are merged, when two

don't have to eliminate lot lines.

to say the -- the lot lines don't have legal effect for

some purposes.

14
15

MR. GROEN:

All we have to do is

And it's only for the limited

purposes of precluding sale or development.

16

But more than that, your question comes

17

right back.

18

you really have to define property interests by the

rights that are already in place that secure benefits.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- Palazzolo depends on the

buyers having the exact same takings claim as the

sellers, which it seems to me does not exist in this

case.

5

But let me ask you a different -- a

6

different way around the question, which is, whether you

7

think reasonable expectations matter at all in your

8

framework?

9

MR. GROEN:

The reasonable expectations that

10

were addressed in Lucas footnote 7 are the expectations

11

that grow out of the traditional understandings of

12

property law.

13

a subdivision that they are buying a -- a -- a lot that

14

has a right of use, that -- that has a deed, that has

15

geographic boundaries, and that's --

People understand when they buy a lot in

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MR. GROEN:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

-- what they are relying upon.
But here, if I'm buying

19

property in this area, I also know that there are these

20

rules about when you can develop on substandard lots and

21

how it is that contiguous lots are understood for

22

purposes of that development potential.

23

buying subject to those preexisting regulations?

24

other words, this is not a regulation that just happened

25

to me when I was an owner.

So why aren't I
In

certain set of things about what I can and can't do on

with my reasonable expectations?

7

the zoning regulations, and when I buy a house, when I

8

buy a piece of land, I'm buying subject to the

9

preexisting zoning regulations.

10

And I'm buying, you know,

So why isn't that perfectly consistent

MR. GROEN:

I'm supposed to know

I understand the use of

determining whether there is a taking.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And it

But what about -- I -- of

course, property is property.

with a provision of the Constitution that, in the

21

regulatory area, is designed to prevent takings that

10

others, or because we are interfering with

11

investment-backed expectations.

12

I mean, as you read the cases it seems to me

13

there are a set of factors like that.

14

with your argument is it wants to take one and then

15

apply a kind of mechanical test.

16

MR. GROEN:

No.

I

3

do think, as I'm reading all of the briefs in this case,

4

that the issue is how much weight should we be giving to

5

the State boundary lines, the State property lines.

6

You say as a denominator on the takings

7

claim, there -- it's fixed.

8

"presumption" in your brief, but you haven't explained

9

to me what overcomes the State boundary line -- property

You used the word

10

lines, so I don't think the word "presumption" has any

11

meaning in your brief.

12

Others, like St. Croix and -- and the

13

government, and embedded in Justice Breyer's question,

14

thinks the denominator should be a more nuanced

15

calculation, although St. Croix, Wisconsin, and the

16

Solicitor General seem to have a different weight to

17

that.

18

So let's start with, is yours a fixed
presumption?

Does anything ever overcome it?

-- presumption is overcome if

7

you have facts that are sufficient to show in fairness

8

and justice that the individual should bear the burden.

9

And an example, we can draw straight out of eminent

10

domain law.

11

they own the parking lot next door, there are two

12

separate parcels, and the government is going to condemn

13

the parking lot.

14

15

eminent domain law is the same principle here.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

2

MR. GROEN:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So the usual way --

There's two questions here.
The usual way, Mr. Groen, or

4

at least a frequent way in which this comes up is a

5

developer buys a hundred acres of land, and that land is

6

split up into 100 one-acre parcels.

7

one-five, percent of them are on wetlands and can't be

8

built on.

9

going to say that those 15 percent are independent lots,

And let's say 15,

It makes an enormous difference whether we're

10

because if they are, then the developer comes in and

11

says you have to pay me for all of that.

12

not, the developer is out of luck because it's only 15

13

percent of the whole.

14

But if they're

Isn't that right?

MR. GROEN:

The beginning part of your

15

analysis says the developer subdivided.

16

cannot subdivide without government approval.

17

there's a subdivision that is created under the laws of

18

that State, then rights attach.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

And when

Well, the subdivision

20

has occurred with government approval, and the merger

MR. GROEN:

And then the

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

question, then, once you've identified the relevant

2

parcel in your hypothetical, the -- the -- the question

3

is, is there a taking of that 15 percent.

4

The burden would be on the government to

5

show that that 15 percent of the lots is actually part

6

of an integrated economic unit as a whole, and then you

7

proceed under a takings analysis.

situations, you must first define the relevant parcel.

to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

But in both

I would like to begin, Mr. Chief Justice, by
answering your question, or the point that you made.

19

The lots here have merged for all relevant

20

purposes under State law.

21

between Lot E and Lot F still exists, but that has

22

absolutely no continuing legal relevance under State

23

law.

24
25

It is true that the lot line

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
is -- raises my exact concern.

Your -- your point

You said "for all

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32

relevant purposes."

2

purposes are relevant?

3

purposes are relevant is analysis under the Takings

4

Clause.

5

The -- the question is what
And it seems to me that what

And we all know the -- the issue, I think,

6

that Justice Breyer brought up.

7

three -- three acres of wetlands and you own a hundred

8

acres.

9

and you've taken it all.

Let's say you have

You say, well, my property is these three acres
The law is you don't get --

10

Mr. Groen doesn't get to define property interests that

11

way because it's gaming the system by saying this is

12

what it is.

13

Now, another one of my colleagues pointed

14

out, there are two halves of the State law here:

Half

15

of it is the lot line, half of it is the merger.

And

16

you want to say, well, for takings purposes, all we look

17

at is -- is the merger.

18

just the flip side of what the landowner can't do.

19

can't sort of preempt the takings analysis by saying

20

we're only going to look at this aspect under which, of

21

course, we win.

22

only going to look at these three -- three acres under

23

which, of course, we win.

24

MR. TSEYTLIN:

You

even more specific.

No, Your Honor.

I want to be

What I meant by "all relevant

purposes," I mean for all purposes under State law.

2

If tomorrow someone went to the county

3

register and deeds and deleted the lot line between

4

Lot E and F, there is not a single right that the Murrs

5

have under State law that they would lose, and there's

6

not a single right they would gain.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. TSEYTLIN:

The key point is -But the key point is

10

they didn't do that.

11

at page G -- 3 of the appendix to the County's brief,

12

And I'm looking

three acres.

19

confusion between the definition of "property" and the

20

question of whether or not there's a takings.

21

you start analyzing with the takings factors and the way

22

there's property, that muddles the whole analysis.

23

And it seems to me that -- that there's a

MR. TSEYTLIN:

And if

Well, Your Honor, let me

24

explain the State's methodology.

25

that, I think I'll be able to answer your question more

And I think in doing

clearly.

2

The test to identify the relevant parcel in

3

the State's submission should be one straightforward

4

question:

5

from any other land under State law?

6

look at all of State law.

7

lot line has no meaning for anyone, it has -- it does

8

not give any rights, which is the case here.

Is the land lot at issue completely separate

that's the end of the question for you; right?

11

Well, look, you've taken away this valuable asset we

were going to use for our retirement.

And the answer is:

And they say:

Well, no, because you

Yeah.

this case?
MR. TSEYTLIN:

No, Your Honor.

The -- the

fundamental difference in this case is that the merger

happened by voluntary action of the plaintiffs.

what the plaintiffs did when they acquired two

conditional stair restriction on the parents who owned

That is to say, if you want to, in this case,

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that's a very fine

7

argument, except for the fact that it's completely

8

contrary to the reasoning in Palazzolo.

9

Kennedy's opinion in Palazzolo rejects that.

Justice
And the

10

debate between Justice O'Connor in concurrence and

Justice Scalia in concurrence is about exactly that.

12

And you don't even cite Palazzolo in your brief, do you?

MR. TSEYTLIN:

That is not correct.

At

pages 41 through 43, we discuss why this is not a

Palazzolo-type claim.

16

Justice Kagan's questions indicated, would be that

something happened in 1976 that was unreasonable.

If -- if one lot is owned by

MR. TSEYTLIN:

It does not want to interfere with any current

MR. TSEYTLIN:

The -- the merger of the two

to apply -- comply with other regulatory restrictions on

you're -- you're left with the nonconforming structure

question?

22

It's a background question.
Suppose these people had Lots E and F

one house, just one?

Then they bought G and H.

now, it's about .9 --

Well, suppose -- suppose

they're just like these lots.

Right now,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If they have E and F, then

they buy G and H, can they build only one house, or two?

9

MR. TSEYTLIN:

Right, Your Honor, just --

10

just let me have two seconds.

11

question.

12

I think I can answer the

Right now, it's .98 net project area.

If

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's right, Your Honor.
Are there other

3

aspects in which the two lots are treated separately

5

MR. TSEYTLIN:

So with regard to the tax

Are these lots

Are they legally separate under State

MR. TSEYTLIN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So to what extent is

24

it wrong for me to understand that the only -- the only

25

sense in which the merger doctrine that you're talking

about applies is with respect to a takings claim?

MR. TSEYTLIN:

No, Your Honor.

They -- it's

with regard to every possible use or sale of these lots.

4

Any development, any sale, anything else a person in the

5

real world would want to do, there would be no

6

difference.

7

could take that they couldn't take if the lot line was

deleted.

9

between Lot E and Lot F as it currently stands --

10

There's not a single action that someone

It makes no difference.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The -- the lot line

And then so there's

11

no reason -- under State law, there is a procedure to

12

eliminate the lot lines, and you're saying that that

13

procedure is irrelevant in this case?

14

MR. TSEYTLIN:

Given the specific facts of

15

this case it would be completely irrelevant.

16

would go through that process because it would not add

17

or subtract any single right to the Murrs if they --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

MR. TSEYTLIN:

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No one

General --- deleted that lot line.
May I ask a question.

The

21

difference between you and the other folks on that side

22

of the room is that they want to look at reasonable

23

expectations, and State law, in part, defines those

24

reasonable expectations, but they're allowing for the

25

idea that other things might come in as well, and you're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

saying it's all and only State law.

2

Now, I'm pretty sympathetic to the idea that

3

preexisting State law really does influence quite a bit

4

your expectations about what property you own and what

5

you can do with it.

6

what the government and the county want rather than what

7

you want in terms of saying the analysis should be a

8

little bit more fluent, fluid, sure, State law matters,

9

but maybe other the things matter too in a particular

10

But still, what's the harm of doing

situation.

11

MR. TSEYTLIN:

Because what you get with any

12

of their approaches is Penn Central squared.

13

say, you have a complex multifactor analysis, basically

14

an all-things-considered analysis at step one, just to

15

figure out the parcel.

16

of cases, you then do a complex multifactor analysis and

17

you -- which is going to look at a lot of the same

18

factors.

19

That is to

And then, in the vast majority

I think one area of agreement among the

20

parties and amicus briefs in this case is this is --

21

area of law is incredibly complicated.

22

to make your way through the weeds.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's difficult

It --

Would it matter to you if it

24

were not possible to build a house that bridged the two

25

Suppose one was at the bottom -- one lot is at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47

the bottom of a cliff and the other is at the top of a

2

cliff.

Would that matter to you?

3

MR. TSEYTLIN:

In defining what the relevant

4

parcel is it would not.

5

doing the hard work of doing the Penn Central analysis,

6

and that's one of the key points I'd like to

7

reemphasize.

It would matter quite a bit in

8

We believe -- may I finish my sentence?

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

MR. TSEYTLIN:

Sure.

We believe that most of the

11

work under takings law should be done at that second

12

step, usually Penn Central.

13

We believe the first step, the parcel

14

question, should be determined in a straightforward way

15

so the Court can move on to doing the hard work of Penn

Central.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT ST. CROIX COUNTY

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, that's -- and

it gets to the questions I was asking early, fairness
and justness.

11

But the -- and if -- actually the -- the

12

point is -- last made by -- by your friend, there are

13

two different questions.

14

there's been a taking.

15

fairness and justice is justice is applied to the second

16

question.

17

what the property was because then you really do get, as

18

he said, Penn Central squared.

19

What is property and whether

I didn't think it was applied to defining

You're looking at fairness and justice.

How

20

should we define this property?

21

justice for what purpose?

22

And then once you define it, then you say well, it's

23

fairness and justice for whether there's been a taking.

24
25

Well, fairness and

Well, for the Takings Clause.

It seems to me that you're just kind of
teeing up the definition of property to give you the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

right answer under the Takings Clause.

2

MR. LAZARUS:

Your Honor, in -- in this

3

case, in Valley, there is some circularity here, but let

4

me tell you why there is some circularity here.

5

And that is because they're making and

6

taking the challenge to a very odd -- a very odd topic,

7

and that is the absence of an exclusion.

8

reason why there's no exclusion for these kinds of

9

substandard commonly adjacent lots is precisely because

And -- and the

10

government has determined over decades that, in this

11

situation, the economic impact isn't so great.

12

isn't so hardship.

13

There

So the premise of the -- of these ordinances

14

is the absence of hardship.

15

the Penn Central analysis or the Lucas analysis for

16

economic impact is to identify when the hardship really

17

is so great to justify the payment of just compensation,

18

it's not surprising that the very teachings of these

19

ordinances is directly relevant to how you evaluate the

20

property.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

And since the purpose of

How can you say that the

22

impact is not -- is categorically not great?

23

somebody buys a lot next to that person's house with the

24

expectation of selling it at some point in the future to

25

meet real needs that come up then, and then the -- a

Alderson Reporting Company

If some --

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

regulation is adopted that says well, sorry, you can't

2

sell it, that there's no hardship there?

3

MR. LAZARUS:

The -- the hardship -- the

4

question though is how do you define the extent of the

5

hardship.

6

under the Penn Central analysis is what the economic

7

impact is, and to define the parcel part of that is

8

to -- to identify what the impact is.

9

And what you want -- what you need to look at

In -- for instance, in this case, the

10

economic impact on the Murrs, right, has to take into

11

account the shared value of the two because the fact is,

12

if you look to what -- there is no general issue of

13

material fact with the lower courts on this question.

14

The value of the two parcels together for one house is

15

$698,000.

16

house on each, is $771,000.

17

The value of two houses separate, with a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's fine except

18

that, in order to realize the value of the two lots put

19

together, they would have to move away.

20
21

MR. LAZARUS:

24
25

But -- and -- and

the -- and they --

22
23

Right.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, they think that's

irrelevant.
MR. LAZARUS:

The takings inquiry is what

the economic impact is on them.

It shouldn't be a

different test depending upon their particular

2

subjective preferences, then someone else's subjective

3

preferences.

4

The -- the fact is -JUSTICE ALITO:

involved.

at -- it's several things.

Your Honor, is the point you mentioned before.

23

for expectations.

We aren't

One thing you look at is the State law

24

You also look at the physical and geographic

25

characteristics of the property; in other words, to find

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

out whether there was any real potential here for unity

2

of use and integrative use.

3

if Lot E and F were different and you had one up above

4

and one down below, that might well be a harder case to

5

suggest that there was that kind of unity of use,

6

integrated.

7

For instance, in this case,

And you look at those three things, because

8

what you're trying to look for to evaluate the parcel is

are suffering in the case.

You know, it's a remarkable finding that

The most extreme example are shoes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me

No

you're -- you're trying to figure out then what the land

interest is.

3

that, which is you go down to the county office and you

4

look at what the -- the lines are between your property

5

and somebody else's or your lot and a different lot.

6

You don't look to whether one is below and one is above,

7

or that, and it seems to me that gets into a very

8

complicated situation when for Federal takings purposes

9

you're redefining what State law says property is.

10

MR. LAZARUS:

determine the economic impact.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

12

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

14
15
16

MS. PRELOGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to begin with your question,

17

Mr. Chief Justice, about why it wouldn't be sensible to

18

just look at lot lines here as the starting point for

19

defining the parcel as a whole.

20

And as Justice Breyer just noted, we think

21

the lot lines are certainly relevant, especially insofar

22

as they might shape reasonable expectations about how

23

property owners expect to use their property and what

24

they expect to remain separate and distinct.

25

urge this Court not to adopt a presumption or a bright

Alderson Reporting Company

But we

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

line rule that focuses on lot lines in isolation.

2

we really see two principal problems with that, one of

3

which is practical, and the other is legal.

4
5
6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Well -- I'm sorry.

Go ahead.
MS. PRELOGAR:

Turning to the practical

7

point first, especially when you're looking at

8

contiguous commonly-owned property, which is the

9

situation the Court is confronting here.

We think that

10

lot lines will frequently not be an accurate indicator

11

of how that claimant is being burdened by the particular

12

regulation, and that's because when you have those

13

contiguous commonly-owned lots, there's a physical unity

14

that frequently opens up the potential for linked use,

15

linked development, a direct reciprocity of advantage,

16

and shared value.

17

And so when thinking about how to address

18

the parcel as a whole issue, where the whole purpose,

19

the whole point is to get a feel for how the regulation

20

is actually impacting this claimant, focusing on lot

21

lines would exclude relevant considerations about the

22

on-the-ground economic realities.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that's -- I just

24

don't know how that works with -- with property.

25

asking whether there's a takings, but asking whether

Alderson Reporting Company

Not

Official - Subject to Final Review

60
1

there's property.

2
3

You say it -- it depends on spacial,
functional, and what's the third thing?

4

MS. PRELOGAR:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

Temporal.
Temporal

considerations.

7

Now, you usually don't say that when you're

8

asking about property.

9

Lot F, and here it is on the map; that's what I own.

You say, I owned Lot E or I own

10

You don't sit down and say:

11

considerations I own this much of it, and when temporal

12

considerations, add this, and functional that.

13

Well, but with spacial

It seems to me that those concerns are

14

pertinent at considering whether there's a taking of the

15

property.

16

that's a whole different question, and you don't get

17

into spacial, you get into what the plat looks like in

18

the county office.

19

But when it comes to what the property is,

MS. PRELOGAR:

I think it's absolutely the

20

case that for terms -- in terms of defining what's a

21

protected property interest, at the outset you look to

22

State law, you look to lot lines, and no one's

23

contesting here that there's a protected property

24

interest.

25

determination does come into the second part of the

But we think that this relevant parcel

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

61
1
2

inquiry in terms of whether there's been a taking.
It's about how do you get a feel for the --

3

the relevant unit of property that's at issue to

4

determine how this regulation is actually affecting this

5

claimant, and so we would put those considerations on

6

the taking side of the line.

7

This Court has always shown a preference in

8

deciding, as Justice Breyer said, and -- and Justice

9

Holmes' famous formulation whether a regulation goes too

10

far, the Court's always shown a preference for being

11

able to engage in that kind of contextual analysis that

12

focuses on all of the relevant facts and circumstances.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem I have with

14

your test, which has the -- the three components, is I

15

don't actually see anywhere in there any weight given to

16

the State property lines.

17

MS. PRELOGAR:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -You don't explicitly

19

list it among those three items.

20

you're weighing it or not weighing it, what presumptions

21

you're giving it or not.

22

your -- your -- your three factors?

23

MS. PRELOGAR:

You don't tell us how

So where does it fit in to

We think that it frequently

24

goes to the functional considerations because it shapes

25

expectations about how land can properly be used,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

62
1

whether it's an entirely separate and distinct issue.

2

So we do think that there's a role for State law to

3

play.

And here we think, actually, that's one of the --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

be more of a role, where would you put it?

6

puts it on the second prong.

7

putting it, and why do you disagree with how they use

8

it?

9

MS. PRELOGAR:

If we think there should
St. Croix

Where would you end up

I think it's very important

10

not to adopt any kind of presumption or bright line rule

11

for the relevant parcel.

12

the second prong of conducting the Penn Central

13

analysis.

14

And so I also would put it on

But the reason for that is because the

15

relevant parcel that the threshold definitional question

16

is going to provide the touchstone that contextualizes

17

the whole rest of the takings inquiry.

18

were to artificially narrow it and look only at lot

19

lines, or to presumptive weight to those lot lines, then

20

that's going to be the focal point for measuring

21

economic impact for looking at investment-backed

22

expectations.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if the Court

Suppose you have lots that

24

are not contiguous but they're very close to each other.

25

Now, under your flexible approach with all these

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

63
1

different dimensions, are they ruled out as a single

2

parcel?

3

MS. PRELOGAR:

I think it would be very

4

difficult to say that those kinds of noncontiguous

5

properties function as an integrated economic unit.

6

I think it would be the rare case where it would be

7

appropriate to aggregate those property interests.

8

I think that it is important to keep in mind that there

9

are so many different ways that property interests

So

But

10

arise, that it is important to have a flexible, nuanced

11

approach here.

12

And Justice Alito, I would just point to the

13

example we raised about the large developer who acquires

14

a large tract, maybe a thousand acres of property, and

15

subdivides it into hundreds --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

That can easily be taken

17

care of by making the rule look to the -- the lots as

18

defined at the time of the acquisition rather than

19

something that was done prior to -- prior to the time

20

when -- when a rule would be -- would be applied.

21

you know, it's fine to say that there are all these

22

dimensions and they should be nuanced and who can be

23

opposed to something that's nuanced.

24

looking for?

25

all these dimensions to determine what?

But what are we

What are we looking for?

Alderson Reporting Company

But,

We're looking at
Could you just

Official - Subject to Final Review

64
1

say as precisely as you can what we would -- we should

2

be looking for in defining what is the property that is

3

taken using all of the different dimensions that are

4

relevant in your view?

5

MS. PRELOGAR:

I think the clearest

6

articulation I have is to say that you should be looking

7

for what in the interest of fairness and justice is an

8

accurate way to measure economic impact.

9

point of the relevant parcel determination.

And that's the
It's

10

focused specifically on the economic impact prong of the

11

equation.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

And is it the economic

13

impact on these particular owners or on some category of

14

hypothetical owners?

15

MS. PRELOGAR:

It's always been an

16

individualized inquiry focused on these particular

17

owners.

18

illustrate the point that when you're conducting that

19

kind of evaluation, it's often the case, as -- as

20

Mr. Lazarus said, that you're going to have a shared

21

value, a reciprocal value that --

22

And I think that the facts of this case well

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what if a lot -- but

23

what if a lot was -- was preserved?

24

bought for the purpose of selling it at some point in

25

the future and/or it was preserved for that purpose so

Alderson Reporting Company

What if it was

Official - Subject to Final Review

65
1

that nothing was built on it so that it could readily be

2

sold?

3

MS. PRELOGAR:

I think that those kinds of

4

reasonable investment-backed expectations have a role to

5

play, but I don't think that they can be dispositive.

6

Because, again, the point of the relevant parcel

7

determination is to accurately gauge economic impact.

8

But I do think that it's important --

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

determinative?

11

legitimate expectations.

12

completely frustrated.

13

Well, why wouldn't they be

I thought you said it was we look to
There, their expectations are

MS. PRELOGAR:

It's certainly the case that

14

anytime anyone's alleging a regulatory taking, the

15

premise of the claim is that they're being prevented

16

from doing something with their property that they

17

wanted to do with it.

18

sufficient to alone define the relevant parcel because

19

it might be the case, as it is here, that there's

20

actually not much of an economic impact at all.

21

We think that that's not

And if that's the case, then this isn't the

22

kind of regulation that is requiring someone to shoulder

23

a burden that in the interest of fairness and justice

24

should be --

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that comes back to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

66
1

my -- but -- but you're saying that they have to move.

2

They can't afford to build a big house here, which is

3

what everybody wants.

4

modest houses anymore.

5

they have to move.

6

They don't want these little
They want McMansions.

They --

That's what you're saying.

MS. PRELOGAR:

But to the extent that a

7

court were to conclude that that is an undue

8

interference with their investment-backed expectations

9

or that the character of that government action is

10

actually unjust and anomalus, then I think that this

11

Court's precedent already builds in sufficient

12

protection for those kinds of interest without trying to

13

rely solely on expectations to identify the relevant

14

parcel.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- but I thought

16

reasonable investment-backed expectations were

17

objective.

18

You're now making them subjective.
MS. PRELOGAR:

Oh, no.

To be clear, Justice

19

Kennedy, we do think that it has to be an objective

20

inquiry.

21

on a fact pattern where the property was acquired before

22

the relevant regulatory restriction was enacted and

23

thereby frustrated the expectations.

24
25

And I understood Justice Alito to be focusing

Here, we think it's actually a critical fact
that Petitioners voluntarily brought this land under

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

67
1

common ownership and so triggered the application of the

2

merger provision decades after the relevant regulatory

3

restriction was in place.

4

that there were any objectively reasonable

5

expectations --

6

And that does weaken the idea

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I actually think

7

they did it -- the parents did it after the ordinance's,

8

from my timeline, creation.

9

1976.

10

And in 1982, the parents took the property under

common ownership from the Atlantic Plumbing Company.

11
12
13

The ordinance was passed in

MS. PRELOGAR:

That's correct.

So that

there -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So neither the parents

14

or the children, if they had been paying attention to

15

the regulatory scheme, had a reasonable expectation that

16

the ordinance wouldn't affect them.

17

MS. PRELOGAR:

That's exactly correct.

We

18

think that the timing here of the relevant transfers of

19

property reinforces the idea that it's proper to view

20

these two parcels together as an integrated whole.

21

And the other facts that I would add to that

22

are the spatial ones, the fact that these are contiguous

23

commonly owned tracts with possibilities for linked

24

development and linked uses that creates that direct

25

shared value that is borne out by the valuation evidence

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

68
1

in this case.

2

you view these lots together as an effectively merged

3

parcel, as they are under State law, then the value is

4

only 10 percent less than the value of two separate lots

5

with two separate building sites.
