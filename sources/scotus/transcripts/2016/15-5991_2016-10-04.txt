ORAL ARGUMENT OF KOREN L. BELL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MS. BELL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

Clause (1) of the Federal Bank Fraud Statute

11

premises culpability on intent to defraud a financial

12

institution, and this case concerns what that element

13

entails.

14

on a century of this Court's precedent, its fraud

15

precedent, makes clear that intent to defraud a bank

16

requires intent both to deceive the bank and wrong the

17

bank in its own property rights.

18

bank's property rights, which includes its own

19

possessory rights, in bank-held property means intent to

20

cause the bank, not the customer, to bear the proper

21

loss of a fraud scheme.

22

The settled meaning of clause (1)'s text based

Intent to wrong a

And in this sense --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Possessory

23

right means I own something.

I'm holding it.

24

criminal charges for larceny, the issue is whether I

25

have a possessory right, regardless of what I want to do

Alderson Reporting Company

In most

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

with this property, over you who's taken it from me.

2

where do you get the next step that possessory right

3

means I have to lose something of value or that I'm

4

going to ultimately bear the loss?

5

merely the loss of the possessory right?

6

MS. BELL:

So

Isn't the loss

Your Honor, the statute turns on

7

intent, and were the government to prove the defendant's

8

intent to deprive of you of your possessory right, and

9

that would be sufficient.

And where that comes from is

10

from this Court's settled fraud precedent.

11

hundred years, the Court has interpreted the term

12

"defraud" to mean property lost to the victim.

13

see that --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Going back a

And we

So if you're insured and

15

the -- or at least the defendant believes he's insured,

16

it isn't theft?

17

MS. BELL:

If the defendant believes that

18

the bank is insured and therefore that another party

19

will bear the loss?

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Even Kardashian's thief, if

21

there is one, believes that all that jewelry is insured.

22

Indeed over insured.

23
24
25

MS. BELL:

So it's not theft?
Well, so it would depend on the

language of the statute.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, it says defraud.

Alderson Reporting Company

She

Official - Subject to Final Review

lied.

2

I'll go as far as you want.

But I don't see that that

3

has anything to do with it.

You mean if he -- if he

4

defrauds him out of the money, he defrauds her out of

5

the jewelry, says here I a.m., your local jewelry

6

cleaner.

7

fraud?

8

triple insured.

9

isn't even her jewelry, that it was just loaned her on

10

He says I'm knocking on the door -- you know,

Gets the jewelry.

Even if she's insured.

Even if he thinks that, in fact, this

MS. BELL:

It would depend on whether the

statute in that case required the intent to defraud --

13
14

Even if he thinks she's

the occasion by a good friend, the necklace.

11
12

Wouldn't you think that was

JUSTICE BREYER:

What the statute says is

defraud.

15

MS. BELL:

Defraud.

In that case it's much

16

like the mail and wire fraud statutes which do not

17

specify a required victim for the fraud scheme, and

18

therefore provided the government could prove the two

19

undisputed components of the term "defraud" which come

20

from --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not asking you to

22

repeat it.

I'm asking you, if the local person comes to

23

the door and says, dear Miss Kardashian, I a.m. your

24

local jewelry cleaner.

25

She does.

Please give me your jewelry.

And that's not fraud.

He wanted to get the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

jewelry.

He tried to get the -- he also believed that

2

the friend had just loaned it for the evening, that

3

she's triple insured, that she won't even lose any money

4

because the publicity will be worth it.

5

MS. BELL:

Right.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay?

And that -Now, my question is:

7

There's the statute.

8

first year of law school, criminal law, that that was

9

fraud, but perhaps I was wrong.

10

I would have always thought from

So I would like you to

explain it.

11

MS. BELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

That would be a

12

scheme to defraud the insurer.

13

the -- and in this case of the mail and wire fraud

14

statutes which penalize a scheme to defraud anyone, for

15

example, and provide heightened penalties for schemes

16

that defraud anyone and happen to affect the bank, then,

17

yes, that would -- would satisfy the statute.

18

the statute specified a particular victim as clause (1)

19

does here, and clause (1) says the intended victim must

20

be the bank, not the customer.

21

If the scheme -- if

But if

And so our argument depends on that -- on --

22

on two steps based on this Court's long-standing fraud

23

precedent.

24

second is the presence of the direct object there.

25

the example that Your Honor posited, there -- there was

The first is how we define defraud.

Alderson Reporting Company

But the
In

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

no required object of the fraud scheme, and therefore at

2

the very least it would certainly constitute a scheme to

3

obtain money or property by means of false pretenses.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You get -- you get

5

mired in some very abstract concepts of property rights.

6

Yes, someone is insured, but here if they keep getting

7

their property stolen, their insurance rates go up.

8

Here, okay, it wasn't that if you -- correct, it wasn't

9

the bank's own property, but it's somebody else's

10

property that they use in making loans.

11

they will have less money to make loans if the property

12

is -- is being taken.

13

And, again,

Now, does your case turn on what the

14

defendant knows even if that's not right?

15

argument may as well -- people commonly think you put

16

your money in the bank, it's your money, and they'll

17

give it back, but of course it's loaned out by the bank.

18

But if the defendant really thinks I'm not -- I don't

19

want to take anything from the bank.

20

from two -- and he's wrong, is -- is he off the hook?

21

MS. BELL:

I mean, the

I'm taking this

Yes, Your Honor.

So first of

22

all, the standard here is not what he knows but what he

23

intends, which this Court, going back to the Durland case

24

in 1896, has equated with purpose, which makes sense

25

because we're talking about a scheme which is a plan

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

with a purpose.

2

particular liability scheme avoids the effect-based

3

technicalities that the government complains of, because

4

it doesn't matter whether the bank in fact has

5

possessory interest or whether the insurer is going to

6

in fact bear the loss.

7

as Your Honor says what the defendant intends, what his

8

purpose is in devising this scheme.

9

And precisely for that reason this

The only thing that matters is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, is that

10

making -- is that ignorance of the law being the defense

11

because the law -- he thinks the bank -- the bank

12

doesn't have any property interest at all, but in fact

13

the bank has the property interest as either a bailee or

14

bailor or -- I forget which one it is -- and the bank

15

has the property interest because it actually uses the

16

money in its own effect, but he's wrong about that legal

17

question of property.

18

defense?

So his ignorance of the law is a

19

MS. BELL:

20

ignorance of the law.

21

about an intent-based liability scheme.

22

is that particular fraud scheme would be punished under

23

clause (2) of this statute.

24

fraud --

25

Your Honor, it wouldn't be
This -- there's nothing anomalous

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the answer

It's not that it's not bank

You mentioned the sub 2.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Do you recognize, do you concede that Shaw could have

2

been charged and convicted under the obtaining property

3

owned by or under the custody or control of a financial

4

institution if the -- if the government had charged that

5

instead of defrauding a financial institution, could

6

Shaw have been found guilty?

7

MS. BELL:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

That was

8

the appropriate charge in this case.

And the reason why

9

the bank fraud statute works as a whole exactly as

10

Congress intended based on this intent-based liability

11

scheme is because the schemes that arise in the federal

12

circuits sort neatly into clause (1), clause (2), or

13

both depending on the design of the scheme.

14

design is in most every practical case in every

15

real-world example going to reflect the intent.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the

Well, design here, the

17

intent here is to harm whoever has a lawful possessory

18

interest.

19

MS. BELL:

Your Honor, the intent required

20

under clause (1) -- and that's quite clear because it

21

specifies the bank -- is to harm the bank in its

22

property right.

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it has a possessory

interest -MS. BELL:

And -- and certainty if the --

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

interest is harmed.

3

the harm to the entity.

4

MS. BELL:

And that possessory

It's the harm to the interest, not

It -- it -- in fact it may be

5

harmed, although in this case, of course this is an

6

example where the banks never suffered any loss, and

7

there was no dispute on that point.

8

Honor, it's true that the --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But certainly, Your

But it was -- was it not a

10

harm to the possessory interest?

11

MS. BELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

Insofar as the

12

bank was deprived for a momentary period of those funds

13

in its coffers, yes, in fact it was deprived.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Ms. Bell, I guess -- I

15

guess what Justice Kennedy is suggesting and maybe I'm

16

confused about the same thing, it now seems to me that

17

there's no difference between your view and the

18

government's view.

19

So, Mr. Yang, I'm putting you on notice that

20

this is a question to you too, because both of you are

21

saying, look, there needs to be an intent to deceive the

22

bank.

23

MS. BELL:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Correct.
And there needs to be an

intent to deprive the bank of some form of property

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

interest, but with the recognition that property

2

interests includes possessory interests, as well as more

3

classic ownership interests.

4

MS. BELL:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you agree with that.

Correct, Your Honor.
I'm going to think, and

6

Mr. Yang you'll tell me, that Mr. Yang would agree with

7

that too.

So what are we fighting about?

8

MS. BELL:

Correct, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Then it's just -- Mr. Yang

10

would say, well, look, a bank has a possessory interest

11

in assets that are part of its depositor's account, and

12

so, you know, that's -- whether you target the

13

depositor's account or you target something else, you're

14

still manifesting the same intent to deprive the bank of

15

a property including possessory interest.

16

MS. BELL:

Right.

I understand, Your Honor.

17

I think there are two issues here.

18

whether an intent to deceive is sufficient for an intent

19

to defraud.

20

instructions that permitted a conviction on that basis.

21

That alone --

22

The first one is

And the Ninth Circuit approved of jury

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That seems right to me.

I

23

want to point, you know, that you might say all of that

24

is right and that the government and you agree, and what

25

you really disagree on is whether these instructions

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

reflected that correct understanding of the law.

2

that seems fair to me.

3

instructions.

And we should talk about the

4

MS. BELL:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
But it seems to me that the

6

understanding of the law is now you are in perfect

7

harmony.

8
9

MS. BELL:
but let me explain.

And

It -- it -- it may be the case,
I think that on the -- the second

10

prong, in terms of if intent to deceive requires more --

11

I'm sorry -- if intent to defraud requires more than

12

just intend to deceive, what is that second piece?

13

there we get to what it means to wrong a bank and its

14

property rights.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

What it says in the

16

instructions is, "Intent to deceive, cheat, or deprive a

17

financial institution of something of value."

18
19

MS. BELL:

Correct, Your Honor.

And that

would --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MS. BELL:

So what's the problem?

That would -- because it's worded

22

in a disjunctive, in other words, or, it permits a

23

conviction on the basis --

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

So the "or" goes between

"to deceive, cheat, or deprive."

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

MS. BELL:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

Correct.

But what you have to cheat,

deceive, or deprive them of, is something of value.

4

MS. BELL:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

And so it was --

is something of value.

7

MS. BELL:

Correct, Your Honor -And a possessory interest

So what are you arguing about?
Your Honor, two things.

First of

8

all, the -- I would disagree, respectfully, with the

9

Court's interpretation of -- of the scheme to defraud

10

instruction.

I do not think that the "deprive the bank

11

of something of value" is plausibly read to modify

12

"deceive" and "cheat."

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

it means "deceive, cheat, or deprive"?

15

MS. BELL:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

Correct, your Honor.
But not of anything.

It

doesn't say anything, what it seeks to deprive them of.

18
19

In other words, you think

And then it comes out of the blue and
says --

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think it --- someone intends a

22

financial institution of value.

23

it means.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what you think

But it -Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

Did you make that

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

argument in the court below?

2
3

MS. BELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

That was

precisely the argument --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

What page?

Do you have it

5

here, by chance, what page you made that particular

6

argument?

7

MS. BELL:

Sure, Your Honor.

8

rebuttal.

9

but let -- let me be clear:

I get that on

I don't want to take the Court's time now,
Here -- we're here because

10

the -- the scheme to defraud requires the intent to

11

defraud, and that -- that's really undisputed that

12

that's the element.

13
14
15

The intent to defraud instruction simply
required the intent to deceive or cheat.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

My colleague Justice

16

Alito has written extensively on this issue of intent

17

versus knowledge.

18

MS. BELL:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

Yes, Your Honor.
Why don't we

All right.

You can

just, instead of using intent --

21

MS. BELL:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

All right.

Yes.

deceive someone without taking property, right?

24

MS. BELL:

Certainly.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.

All right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Someone can

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

open up an account in a false name.

They've deceived

2

the bank, but it's not to cheat the bank of anything its

3

holding.

4

hide money from, right?

But it's to the cheat the wife who he wants to

5

MS. BELL:

Okay.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
So nothing of value has

7

been taken.

You can cheat the bank in that way, too,

8

out of moving something somewhere, but not to take it.

9

Okay?

10

MS. BELL:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And you can deprive

12

someone of property without deceiving or cheating them.

13

You can rob them, right?

14

MS. BELL:

Correct.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So I

16

thought -- and this is what Justice Kagan was getting

17

to -- it has to be that you deceive or cheat and deprive

18

someone of property, correct?

19
20

MS. BELL:

Your Honor, the cheat, I think,

is synonymous with the concept of --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MS. BELL:

23
24
25

Of defrauding.

-- of -- of -- well, defrauding.

Your Honor is correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You -- you defraud

someone by deception.

6

They're not two different elements.

7

It's the intent to defraud.

8
9
10
11
12

I'm sorry.

It's one element.

But there are two components of defraud, and
the government doesn't dispute that.

That comes from

the Hammerschmidt case in -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So far, I perfectly

understand your point.

13

MS. BELL:

Thank you.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.

That the defraud element

15

has two prongs to it; deception, for the lack of --

16

deception is one prong and deprivation is the other.

17

You're taking the money by -- or the possessory interest

18

by deception.

19

And you're saying that by using the

20

disjunctive, the "or," the jury could have convicted

21

merely for deceiving the bank, but didn't find that they

22

deceived "and" deprived the bank of a possessory

interest, correct?

MS. BELL:

That's exactly right.

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, Justice Breyer has

asked the operative question.

3

MS. BELL:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -- and it's what

5

confused me throughout, both in the discussions below

6

and here.

7

At first, I thought this case was only about

8

reading your brief about whether the deprivation had to

9

be of something the bank owned.

10

MS. BELL:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

As opposed to had a

12

possessory interest in.

13

you seem to have backed off from that claim.

14

to be saying "owned" can mean merely a possessory

15

interest.

16

And Justice Kagan rightly says
You seem

Is that correct, now?
MS. BELL:

Your Honor, we don't see that as

17

a different formulation, and let me explain why, 'cause

18

I certainly understand the confusion.

19

The -- the standard is that comes from this

20

Court's fraud precedent, the mail and wire fraud

21

precedent that everybody agrees is the operative body of

22

law is the intent to wrong the bank in its property

23

rights.

That's --

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. BELL:

In its what?

In its property rights.

Alderson Reporting Company

In its own property rights.

Which you -- which you now

include can include possessory interests.

4

MS. BELL:

Correctly.

And we certainly

5

never meant to -- to disavow that.

6

does that mean in practice?

7

means is the intent to cause the bank, and not the

8

customer, to -- to bear the property loss of the scheme.

9

The issue is what

And in practice what that

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's not what it means.

13

And maybe something more is required.

14

be deprive of an ownership interest or cause a loss, but

15

depriving of a possessory interest is not the same as

16

causing a loss to the bank.

10

That's not what it

means.

17

MS. BELL:

Maybe it has to

Well, let me explain how I mean

18

it.

I mean it in the sense that, as this Court has

19

recognized, when you intend a deprivation of a victim,

20

you -- you also -- the mirror image of that is the

21

intended acquisition.

22

the idea that when you intend -- if a defendant were --

23

and I have never seen a case in my personal practice, or

24

anywhere in the Federal circuits, that approaches

25

anything like an intent to actually deprive the bank of

its possessory interest.

2

What defendants think about when they posit

3

these schemes to get customer deposits is to either --

4

is either that they are taking the customer's money, or

5

they are taking the bank's money, insofar as the bank is

6

suffer the loss.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Most of them don't care.
You want us to write an

10

opinion -- you want us to write an opinion and say it's

11

perfectly lawful under this statute, section (1), to

12

knowingly deprive someone of a possessory interest by

13

deception?

14

MS. BELL:

Well, Your Honor, I think --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MS. BELL:

You want us to write that?

No, Your Honor.

Insofar as first

17

of all, the standard would be the intent, right?

18

we're talking about the -- the intent, which is

19

different than knowledge --

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Intend to deprive someone

21

by deception of a possessory interest is proper.

23

are saying?

24
25

MS. BELL:

So

You

That's what you -- that's what you

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your point is you have to

have the intent to the hurt the -- the bank --

6

That does not come up in practice, however.

MS. BELL:

Exactly, Your -- exactly, Your

Honor.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MS. BELL:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- not the customer.

That is exactly right.
So if you -- if the

10

customer will end up bearing the loss, then you say one

11

doesn't apply.

12
13
14

What does one cover, in your view, other
than check hiding?
MS. BELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

It -- it

15

applies to -- it applies to any scheme designed to cause

16

the bank -- that -- that targets the bank as the

17

financial victim of the fraud by means of concealment,

18

omission, or any other kind of --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

By watching the movies,

20

most -- I'd be afraid, in this case, that we're going to

21

write something of five pages that nobody's going to

22

understand, with the simple thing, Jessie James goes up

23

to the bank, says, your money or your life.

24

behind the teller is a drawer, and you know he's -- that

25

in that drawer, the last five customers have given him

Alderson Reporting Company

He sees

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

some money.

2

That's the money he wants.
It doesn't matter whether, in fact, the bank

3

is going to put that money in Joe Smith's account, or

4

whether the bank has something called a possessory

5

interest or something else.

6

James' brother comes up and says, Jessie James is on the

7

way, give me the money, it should be the same result.

8

Now that's very simple-minded, but -- and

9

And in fact, if Jessie

it's built in me by the movies, but if, in fact, you

10

have a different approach, I would like to know where in

11

the law that different approach is, and why it is,

12

and -- and how this does -- how this is -- I'm afraid,

13

in other words, of confusion.

14

You unconfuse me, please.

15

MS. BELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

And when

16

Your -- when Your Honor says, if I have a different

17

approach in terms of where our -- where our construction

18

of clause (1) comes from in -- in the Court's

19

precedents?

20

Is that the question?
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, my question is, why

21

hasn't Jessie James or his brother committed a crime --

22

the brother, probably, because he's lied and says Jessie

23

James is on the way, and whether the money behind the

24

desk was put there, to everyone's knowledge, by the

25

depositors, or whether the money happens to have been

2

founder, makes no difference to this statute.

3

want to know why it should, or anything else you want to

4

say about that.

5

MS. BELL:

And I

So that case where there's some

6

ambiguity, and this gets back to Your Honor's question,

7

Justice Ginsburg, that case would be best charged under

8

clause (2), which covers schemes that intend to

9

victimize either the customer or the bank provided the

10

requisite means of a false statement.

11

So whenever there's any ambiguity in terms

12

of what as a practical matter does this cover,

13

clause (2) will cover the customer scheme in Loughrin --

14

I'm sorry, the altered-check scheme in Loughrin, and it

15

will cover the deposit scheme here.

16

It will cover Your Honor's hypothetical,

17

provided the intent's also to deceive and it's not just

18

plain, let's say, bank larceny which is covered under

19

another statute and focuses on the effect of the

20

conduct.

21

And clause (1) then is reserved for other

22

cases like check kiting, which was a major, major

23

impetus for this statute's enactment, and Congress knew

24

at the time, based on this Court's 1982 decision in

25

Williams that check kiting was not going to be covered

Official - Subject to Final Review

23

under clause (2).

2

of bank fraud.

3

It's one of the most pervasive forms

So that's not a minor role that clause (1)

4

serves.

5

fraud and the bank embezzlement types of cases no

6

affirmative false statement.

7

But in addition, it's going to serve the loan

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So if we

8

disagree with you, if we were to say that this

9

subsection 1 means that you are targeting property

10

that -- depriving any bank of property in which it has a

11

possessory interest --

12

MS. BELL:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and we say you don't

14

have to prove the bank is going to lose anything of

15

value, that it's going to be reimbursed by insurance or

16

that ultimately the customer is going to receive -- bear

17

the loss, so long as you have defrauded the bank, some

18

deception to the bank, and deprived it of some

19

possessory interest, whether it bears the loss or not,

20

if that's how we rule, do you lose this case?

21

MS. BELL:

No, Your Honor, because it comes

22

down to the requisite intent and purpose.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

you.

We're disagreeing with

That's how we're going to say what it means.
MS. BELL:

Yes, I understand.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Do you

think -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Bell, I think your

4

answer is, no, Your Honor, because the instructions

5

don't reflect your understanding of the law.

6

MS. BELL:

We certainly win on that basis.

7

So reversal is required because the intent to defraud

8

means more than just --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm not saying it does.

10

think it's a hard question as to whether the

11

instructions do or don't, but it does seem to me you

12

have an argument about the instructions.

13

MS. BELL:

Right.

I

That's -- that's correct,

14

and I think we also, though, would not lose under that

15

second question about even if the Court construes --

16

which we agree with -- but the intent must be to harm

decision we see from this Court starting with --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's the economic

But if the Court

21

disagrees with you about that, if the Court thinks that

22

someone doesn't require that you intend to cause the

23

bank financial harm, only that you intend to deprive the

24

bank of something of value, if that's -- by deception --

25

MS. BELL:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- should the Ninth

Circuit be affirmed?

3

MS. BELL:

No, but --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Should we reject your

5

theory that you have to intend to cause the bank a

6

financial loss?

7

MS. BELL:

No, Your Honor, and let me be

8

clear because I understand that it is confusing with the

9

different theories, but our -- those two formulations

10

that Your Honor articulated are one in the same in our

11

view.

12

In other words, the intent to wrong a bank

13

in its property rights is the second component of

14

defraud, but what does that mean in practice?

15

not nonsensical for a jury.

16

bank must bear the loss of the scheme.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's not what it means.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have a lot of cases,

That's

What that means is that the
And so --

19

and I think the model penal code started it, where you

21

always, but normally it covers both purpose and

22

knowledge.

would lead to the death of the footman, even though you

example.

Okay.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the famous

Yes, Your Honor.
So intent includes, unless

5

there's some contrary which you could argue, to the

6

both.

7

to show, scheme to defraud, means that the person

it, to deceive, cheat or deprive.

The statute that can -- the instruction they have

That's where the "or"

10

is, deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of

the problem?

What's the problem?

So what is wrong with that instruction?
That's -- that's what I need explanation.

24

that, and then if I may reserve the remainder of my

25

time.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

That -- the problem with that instruction is

2

that it allows for a conviction on the basis of a scheme

3

to deceive the bank alone.

4

Now even if Your Honor disagrees with me, as

5

it seems that you might, that problem is compounded by

6

the intent to defraud instruction, which plainly it does

7

not include the something of value reference.

8

plainly allows for a conviction on the basis of an

9

intent to deceive alone.

It

That flies in the face of this

10

Court's fraud precedent, and we see this going from

11

Hammerschmidt, in which the Court equated the idea of

12

wronging a bank in its property rights, to pecuniary or

13

property loss.

14

We see it two years later in the Cone

15

decision where the Court made it clear that an intent to

16

take something from the United States, in that case the

17

statute designated the United States, that that was

18

insufficient to simply intend to take something from the

19

United States custody without showing the intent to

20

cause pecuniary and property loss.

21

the way through to Pasquantino, the 2005 decision about

22

economic injury, through to Skilling, where the Court

23

says traditional fraud involves the loss of property.

24

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

10
11
12
13

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The intent required in this bank fraud

14

scheme -- case is an intent to deceive the bank for the

15

purpose of depriving it of something of value.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, all right.

17

Sorry to stop you so early on, but I did not understand

18

that to be the argument in your brief.

19

I'm looking at the heading C on page 36.

20

Section 1344(1) requires proof of an intent to deceive a

21

bank, not to cause it monetary loss.

22

understand -- I'm not sure what -- when Justice Kagan

23

proposed, asked, suggested she was going to ask you the

24

question, I guess I a.m., I did not think -- I did not

25

think you agreed with the Petitioner because I think the

Alderson Reporting Company

It -- so I didn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

Petitioner is saying very strongly intent to deceive is

2

not enough.

3

And I understand you to say that it is.
MR. YANG:

I'm sorry that the -- the heading

4

was a little incomplete, but I think the rest of our

5

brief, when you take it in context --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What's missing?

Well, not just the heading,

8

but analysis in that part C as well.

9

just seems to contradict part A or B or whichever it

10

I mean, the part C

was.

11

MR. YANG:

What we were trying to --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If you really mean an intent

13

to deceive is not enough, that you need something about

14

to deprive the bank of its property interest.

15

MR. YANG:

Yes.

And I think if you look,

16

for instance, at page 14 and then at page 17 of

17

footnote 1, at page 31 we say what's required is

18

1344(1), which is on page 14, reaches deceptive schemes

19

designed to deprive the bank of property.

20

Then on --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What does the -- do

22

they have to have the intent to deprive the bank of

23

property?

24
25

MR. YANG:

Well, when you're designing --

when you're -- there's only one schemer here, right, so

the scheme is his scheme.

4

And does the scheme have to
That's what the jury

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

I just want

5

to clear up that it is not enough to deceive a bank,

6

right?

7

MR. YANG:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10

No, no, no, of course -Well, not of course,

since that's what you said.
MR. YANG:

My apologies.

I think, though,

11

that when you take a look at the other parts of our

12

briefs, and apology that we were trying to -- trying to

13

distinguish --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. YANG:

Okay.

-- between intent to harm from

16

the intent to deceive, and we used some words that may

17

have lead to confusion.

18

That's not our position.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then if that's

19

the case, then it all comes down to the instruction,

20

deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of

21

something of value.

22

Because you -- as I understand your position

23

as clarified, you do have to have the intent to deprive

24

a financial institution of something of value.

25

MR. YANG:

Right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Well, then

2

it's all a question of whether "deceive" and "cheat"

3

stand alone, or if they are also modified by "of

4

something of value."

5

MR. YANG:

I think there's actually a deeper

6

disagreement here, and I'm happy to talk about the jury

7

instructions, and the jury instructions, of course, have

8

to be read as a whole.

9

particularly in conjunction with the materiality

And when you read that, and

10

requirement, which is discussed -- in a material matter,

11

you have to deceive the -- defraud the bank as to a

12

material matter, and a material matter is one that has a

13

tendency that causes the bank to part with money or

14

property -- I think when you read the instructions as a

15

whole, there's really no problem with the instructions,

16

but there's a really -- there is a deeper argument here.

17

And that is the argument that Petitioner

18

says that you have to intend to take something that you

19

know is a property interest of the bank.

20

have knowledge of that.

21

that they were disputing whether a possessory interest

22

was enough, but they've given that up.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You have to

And I had thought until today

Yes, so it seems to me,

24

Mr. Yang, that the real disagreement that you have is

25

that Ms. Bell wants to equate and intends to deprive a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

bank of a property interest with an intent to have a

2

bank suffer a pecuniary loss in the end.

3

are the same things.

4

Let's assume you're right.

5

that whether the bank in the end suffers a monetary loss

6

is utterly irrelevant to the form of intent that's

7

required by this statute.

8

one, let's say.

9

MR. YANG:

10

She says those

You say they're different things.
Let's assume that that's --

All right?

So you won that

Okay.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Go back to the Chief

11

Justice's question about how these instructions reflect

12

that there needs to be an intent to deprive the bank of

13

a posessory interest in property.

14

MR. YANG:

I will go to those instructions,

15

and I'm kind of happy to discuss them, but I don't think

16

that's the end of the matter.

17

actually two questions that are -- that Petitioner is

18

trying to merge that are distinct.

19

actually --

20
21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24
25

And they're

I thought I was giving you

them.

22
23

I do think that there are

MR. YANG:
arguments.

No, no.

They're making two

One -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I know --

MR. YANG:

2

3

the last part of your argument.

4

you mind?

5

We want it first.

Do

Okay.
MR. YANG:

Not at all.

I'm happy to discuss

6

it.

7

this Court's decision, the bigger ones I'd like to get

8

to.

9

But in terms of the enduring legal consequence of

But I will discuss the instructions here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we know there's a

10

big picture in the world, but we want to know about the

11

instructions first.

12

MR. YANG:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14
15

The instructions -The enduring

consequence to Mr. Shaw is a little bit different, so -MR. YANG:

Undoubtedly.

But the Court

16

generally doesn't take cases for error construction, and

17

I want to -- and in the government's interest goes to

18

the broader question of what does Section 1344(1) --

19
20
21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Say, Mr. Yang, the

instructions.
MR. YANG:

So on the instructions -- this is

22

at pages 17 through 19 of the joint appendix.

23

first instruction that's relevant is the instruction

24

that the defendant has to have knowingly executed a

25

scheme to defraud -- that's a defined term -- a

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

financial institution as to a material matter.

2

Now, we look -- if you turn the page to 18,

3

the scheme to defraud is a scheme in which someone

4

intends to deceive, cheat or deprive a financial

5

institution of something of value.

6

Here there's only one schemer.

So the

7

schemer, the one that created the scheme, had to intend

8

to deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of

9

something of value.

10

Now, remember the first instruction that we

11

discussed talks about -- has to be a scheme to defraud

12

as to a material matter.

13

page 18, a material matter is one that has the necessary

14

tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the

15

financial institution to part with money or property.

16

This is what a scheme to defraud is.

17

If you go further down on

Now, I don't think when you take that in

18

context, and you have to read instructions holistically,

19

that there's really any question --

20
21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
21.

You're cherry-picking.

22

MR. YANG:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

an intent to deceive or cheat.

25

Don't forget instruction

MR. YANG:

Well --

Right.

An intent to defraud is

And then we'll have to go

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

back to instruction 17 to see how that fits in.

2

second part is you also have to independently find that

3

you did so; that is, execute the scheme to defraud that

4

we discussed as to a material matter, with intent to

5

defraud the financial institution.

6

The

So their intent to defraud simply says you

7

have to intend or deceive or cheat, again, the financial

8

institution.

9

single-person fraud scheme like this because you've

10

That's somewhat superfluous in a

already defined the scheme to embed those requirements.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you've

12

kind of -- instruction, you do read it in context, but

13

if I read instruction 18 in the context of 21, it kind

14

of highlights that you have deceive or cheat separate

15

from the deprivation of something of value.

16

So linguistically, you have to say that what

17

they meant in the instructions was somebody who intends

18

to deceive a financial institution of something of

19

value.

20
21
22
23

And that's just not grammatical.
MR. YANG:

It's not great, but it's not --

but it's not unacceptable here because -JUSTICE BREYER:

It's okay once you put in

the word "material" --

24

MR. YANG:

I think --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- which is what you have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

in instruction 17.

2

MR. YANG:

I think that's --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

It says you have to execute

4

a scheme or defraud a financial -- to defraud a

5

financial institution as to a material fact.

6

assumes it was separate.

7

MR. YANG:

No, no.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that

But the material --

The deceive was separate.

9

You would have to deceive the financial institution as

10

to a material fact, which is defined in instruction 19

11

as one that has a natural tendency to influence a

12

financial institution to part with money or property.

13
14

So what you took away in instruction 21, you
gave back in instruction 19.

15

So it's a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so in 18, sales

16

deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of

17

something of value.

18

along with "deprive," but it doesn't go along with

19

"deceive."

20

MR. YANG:

"Something of value" goes right

I don't think that's correct.

I

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not if they -- not

if they -- not if they read instruction 21, which

talks -- has nothing to do with -- it just says intent

10

to deceive or cheat, nothing of something of value.

11

when you quote the instruction on page 46 to make it

12

read, to make it make sense, you have to add in, as you

13

do, after deceive, deceive the bank out of something of

value --

15

MR. YANG:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

no sense to say deceive of something of value.

18

MR. YANG:

And

But I think --- Because it makes

It doesn't even parse under

20

thinks that you have to deceive, cheat or deprive the

institution.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They're kind of right.

It

24

doesn't -- it doesn't parse neatly under either reading.

But I have to say that if I'm a reader, the way I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

understand this is you have to -- you have to show --

2

the scheme has to be one to deceive a bank, to cheat a

3

bank or to deprive a bank of something of value.

4

that case, the "deceive a bank" is operating as a

5

disjunctive clause without the "of something of value."

MR. YANG:

No, I think actually you could

read --

alone, cheat a bank alone, or deprive a bank of

something of value.

11

it's enough if the bank was deceived.

MR. YANG:

And so I'm a juror.

I say, well,

I don't see how you can read --

you might say just "deceive" in the abstract.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

you're deceiving somebody.

16

MR. YANG:

No, it's got to be that

Well, but if you're deceiving the

17

bank, if a financial institution, which follows,

18

connects to deceive, then so does "of something of

19

value."

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I don't think so

21

because that would make no sense.

22

scheme must be one to deceive a bank of something of

23

value.

It would be the

Well, I think it's more than

It's just -- like, it doesn't make sense.

context, right, you have to take this -- this is the

definition of scheme to defraud.

something like a scheme to defraud a bank is a scheme

MR. YANG:

I don't think we've quite said

which is the general proposition that you just have

to -- that bank fraud -- excuse me -- that -- jury --

9

this is 46 -- jury instructions must be viewed in the

10

context of the overall charge.

11

this in light of the materiality charge, any kind of

12

ambiguity that might have been interjected in the

13

definition of scheme to defraud I think is sufficiently

14

displaced.

15

And when you look at

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's just not the

instruction.

18

"The defendant was guilty of bank fraud because he

19

intended to deceive the bank."

21

with what the court of appeals held.

22

It's what the court of appeals held.

MR. YANG:

Again, I think this may be a

problem with some brevity.

I don't think the court of

obtain something from the bank.

opinion.

And I don't think that, you know, just as the

That's what bank fraud

But I'd like to get back to I think what's a
broader issue here, which is what is the intent
required.

11

And particularly -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Just tell us:

Why

12

didn't -- why didn't the government charge under (2),

13

which your colleague has agreed fits this case, that if

14

he had been charged under (2) and convicted, that would

15

be fine?

16

MR. YANG:

Because under (2), you need to

actually prove a misrepresentation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because under (2) you

have to prove -MR. YANG:

You have to prove a false

21

statement or false misrepresentation.

Now, in the

22

context of crimes that occur over the Internet, there's

23

some complications that are involved with that.

24

charging decision was to take (1) -- clause (1) remember

25

is scheme to defraud.

The

This is the -- the mothership of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

language from the fraud statutes.

2

mail fraud and the wire fraud.

3

was broad, and Congress intended to adopt it

4

specifically because it was broad.

5

It comes from the

Congress knew that this

And, in fact, Congress considered drafting

6

language that would have required scheme to harm, cause

7

economic loss to a financial institution, and

8

specifically rejected it after the Department of Justice

9

said, hey, that's too narrow.

10
11

Scheme to defraud is

broader, and this would unduly narrow the statute.
So the government chose clause (1) because

12

it was the broader clause, and we didn't need clause (2)

13

which -- it could have complicated proof a little bit.

14

Now, on the two questions that Petitioners

15

presented, two kind of legal questions are, does the

16

defendant have to have some knowledge of the legal

17

property status of the thing that's being taken?

18

think the answer is clearly no.

the money he took was customer deposit accounts, didn't

23

belong to the bank, he didn't ever intend to harm the

24

bank, he'd still be -- you'd still call it bank robbery.

25

And if he did the same thing through deceit, you'd call

5

interest that Congress is trying to advance is to

6

protect the integrity of banks.

7

does not depend on what's subjectively in the

there are many situations.

4
5

No, no.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because you're obtaining

Yeah, yeah.

So how do you

want to do this one?

6

MR. YANG:

So in bank fraud, the intent

7

required -- and remember, there's more than just intent.

8

As a fact we do have to prove there was a property

9

interest to the bank.

10

So, for instance, in your

example --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

There was, but it was a

12

property interest in the bank.

prove in respect to that property interest is in the

14

defendant's mind?

to obtain something of value.

Now, in order to --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I quoted you it was, that

4

it's an -- it's an intent to deprive the bank of a

5

property, including a possessory interest.

6

MR. YANG:

No.

And the reason it's

7

something of value that in fact is a possessory

8

interest.

9

Whether or not the defendant knows it's a property --

10

Whether or not -- or a property interest.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

But the bank -- the

11

bank has to have a possessory interest in -- a property

interest in this thing.

MR. YANG:

Right.

And property interest is

broad.

that property interest.

Now, the money happens to, in fact, be a property

know that.

When we're

talking -- we're talking about financial institutions,

What did this defendant have to know about this

18

MR. YANG:

It didn't have to know its status

19

as a bank under the statute.

It just had to know it's

21

is a bank under the statute.

Mr. Yang, you referred to

Your answer would be

the same, right --

2

MR. YANG:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- if -- if somebody went in

4

and said, I'd like to see the security deposit boxes,

5

and -- and made a false statement to the bank about his

6

entitlement to see the security deposit boxes and took

7

the money out?

8

MR. YANG:

Yes.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Doesn't -- you know, the

10

bank still has a possessory interest in that, even

11

though it doesn't use that money in the same way; is

12

that correct?

13

MR. YANG:

Correct.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let me give you another

15

example.

Suppose that I'm sitting in a coffee shop and

16

somebody comes up to me and says, I have to make a phone

17

call; would you just hang on to my computer for a

18

minute?

19

comes up, the fraudster comes up, and says, oh, she just

20

told me to pick up her computer from her --

And then disappears, and then somebody else

21

MR. YANG:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

Uh-huh.
-- and that's a

misrepresentation.

MR. YANG:

MR. YANG:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do I -- have I had a

possessory interest in that computer just because

4

somebody said, why don't you take a look, you know --

5

you know -- keep -- keep your eye on this?

6

MR. YANG:

Gratuitous bailee is what they

7

would be.

8

say yes for purposes of the -- the fraud statute.

9
10

Now this wouldn't, of course, be bank fraud.
And --

11
12

And I think the answer is -- I think we would

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But I

mean --

13

MR. YANG:

But -- but --

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What you're essentially

15

saying is that anything I can think of, any hypothetical

16

I can think of which involves my hanging on to something

17

for somebody else, that I have a possessory interest in

18

that sufficient to satisfy this scheme.

19

MR. YANG:

Yeah.

And I don't -- it's

20

sufficient for this purposes.

And I don't think this is

21

unusual.

22

relative to other people.

23

would not be superior to the person who owned the

25

having no claim of right -- no valid claim of right to

2

So yes, that, I think, could fall within the

3

general understanding of a scheme to defraud.

4

Obviously, not a scheme to defraud a financial

5

institution.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, that suggests to me

7

that as long as the person knows that the money is

8

being -- is in the bank somehow, it just shouldn't

9

matter, because anything counts as a possessory

10

interest, right?

11

MR. YANG:

It shouldn't -- it shouldn't

12

matter at all.

13

would not have wanted to add some additional knowledge

14

requirement about the property status of the money.

15

does it matter?

16

And I think that emphasizes why Congress

All it does is complicate things.

Congress would not have wanted to carve out

this type of conduct as noncriminal.

It just doesn't make any sense.

5

This is not what Congress intended.

It has

no -- no basis in the text or history of the bank fraud.

history, it rejected language that would have adopted

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KOREN L. BELL

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

17

MS. BELL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

To get back to Justice Breyer's question

19

about where in the record was this disputed, that --

20

that is at pages 646 to 647.

21

myself -- specifically made the argument that the

22

problem with this -- this instruction, exactly as

23

Justice Sotomayor, and I believe Justice Kagan, pointed

24

out, is the disjunctive wording of intent, the intent to

25

defraud.

And there, counsel --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counselor, assume I

agree with you --

3

MS. BELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- that there were parts

5

of your argument, both below and here in your brief,

6

that suggested the instructional error.

7

is that the way you presented the argument was

8

confusing.

9

MS. BELL:

10
11

But what I find

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It took a lot of teasing

out.

12

Does -- how does that affect what we do.

13

MS. BELL:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
That -- that you weren't

15

clear in the instruction, don't you forfeit that

16

argument?

17
18

MS. BELL:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I know what your

two claims are.

21

MS. BELL:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

The -- the claim

is that the intent to -- we challenge --

19
20

No, Your Honor.

Okay.
The question is if I

disagree --

24

MS. BELL:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- with your basic

Alderson Reporting Company

56

premise that you need to prove pecuniary loss to the

2

bank -- I know you want to win that, but please accept

3

my hypothetical.

4

that the only issue is that you have to cheat and

5

deprive the bank of a possessory -- of something in a

6

possessory -- in their possessory interest.

7

Simple as that.

8

have to intend to cause pecuniary loss.

9
10

I disagree with you that the only --

Okay?

It doesn't have to cause -- you don't
All right?

Where does that leave your instructional
error?

11

MS. BELL:

It's -- it's still an error, Your

12

Honor, because it permitted a conviction on the basis of

13

the mere intent to deceive the bank.

15

component of the instruction, how --

Court.

And that was consistently made from the

The only question has been how to formulate; if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

more than intent to deceive is required, then what more?

2

How do we explain that second component?

3

Hammerschmidt itself, which is the

4

undisputed applicable definition here, uses a number of

5

different formulations, and that's part of where the

6

confusion comes from.

7

Hammerschmidt says the intent to defraud is

8

the intent to deceive, and it also uses the -- and to

9

wrong a bank in its property rights.

It equates to

10

wrong a bank in its property rights with to deprive a --

11

I'm sorry -- a victim.

12

It equates to wrong a victim in its property

13

rights with depriving a victim of something of value,

14

and it also equates that with cheating a victim out of

15

something of property, and also.

16

more confusing in terms of the number of formulations,

17

it says that the mail fraud statute is limited to the

18

infliction of pecuniary or property loss.

19

formulations come out of the Hammerschmidt case.

20

To make matters even

And so our

And what we have always asked the Court to

21

do here is to construe intent to defraud to require, not

22

just the intent to deceive, as the lower court

23

instructions required, but also the intent to do that

second thing, which is --
