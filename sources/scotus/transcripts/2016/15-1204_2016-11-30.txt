ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

Congress provided extensive substantive and

12

procedural protections for aliens whom the government

13

wishes to remove, but at the same time, addressed the

14

real concerns about recidivism and flight risk by

15

providing for mandatory detention during removal

16

proceedings for certain categories of criminal aliens

17

and aliens arriving at our shores.

18

The Ninth Circuit undid that legislative

19

balance, invoking principles of constitutional avoidance

20

to require the government to release those aliens unless

21

the government can prove by a preponderance of the

22

evidence every six months that detention remains

23

necessary.

24
25

The Ninth Circuit's decision is a serious
misuse of the constitutional avoidance canon.
Alderson Reporting Company

With

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

respect to arriving aliens, there is no constitutional

2

problem to avoid.

3

the statute is constitutional in the vast majority of

4

applications, and any concerns about outlier cases

5

involving lawful permanent residents can be dressed in

6

as-applied challenges.

7

As even the Ninth Circuit recognized,

And with respect to criminal aliens, the

8

text of the statute forecloses the Ninth Circuit's

9

approach, and in any event, the statute is

10

constitutional as written under this Court's decision in

11

Demore.

12

The net result of the Ninth Circuit's

13

one-size-fits-all rule is -- is a regime that's at odds

14

with the text that Congress enacted.

15

DHS's enforcement priorities, and it creates incentives

16

for individual aliens to delay their removal

17

proceedings.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It undermines

What about 1225(a), that

19

is, aliens who don't fit in either of the categories

20

that you discussed?

21

not people who have committed qualifying criminal

22

offenses.

23

They are not entrants, and they are

So they are the 1225(a) people.
GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

That's right, Your

24

Honor.

So for those individuals, they have had bond

25

hearings, or at least they often have had bond hearings.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

And -- and so we're talking about individuals who either

2

had bond hearings and had them denied or have been

3

unable to post bond.

4

With respect to those -­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What would be the

6

constitutional entitlement to keeping those people, if

7

they're not a flight risk or a -- a risk to the safety

8

of the country?

9

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

10
11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -­
Or to others?

However

you want to define that danger element.

12

So what's the constitutional entitlement,

13

just arbitrarily, to keep someone who's neither of those

14

two things?

15

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So with respect to the

16

1225(a)(1) individuals that Justice Ginsburg was talking

17

about, those are individuals who have had bond hearings

18

and had them denied or have been unable to post bond.

19

And the requirement that we are concerned about there is

20

that the government bears the burden of proof to show by

21

clear and convincing evidence every six months that they

22

are not a flight risk or not a -- or not likely to -- to

23

recidivate.

24

And -­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Clarify two things.

Alderson Reporting Company

One,

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

what are the -- what have the people in that category

2

done that would make them subject to removal; and two,

3

does the government read the bond specification in

4

1225(a) as discretionary?

5

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, the -­

6

I think the government's practice with respect to the

7

latter question is to provide bond hearings consistent

8

with the -- consistent with the statute is my

9

understanding, and that -- and so those are people who

10

have had bond hearings and we do provide them there.

11
12

And, I'm sorry, Your Honor, your first
question?

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Who would -­

14

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So they may be

15

individuals who have -- who have entered illegally but

16

have not committed the kinds of crimes that would make

17

them inadmissible under 1182(a)(2) or -- or deportable

18

under -- that would subject them -- the types of crimes

19

that would subject you to 1226(c) for the mandatory

20

detention there.

21

objecting principally to the clear and convincing

22

evidence standard which we think the Ninth Circuit

23

really had no basis in the statute for adopting.

24

there are -­

25

And so, again, for that class, we are

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Am I right that in -- in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

bail hearings, it's clear and convincing to show that

2

there is a public danger, but only by a preponderance of

3

the evidence to show flight risk in regular bail

4

hearings?

5

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, it

6

does vary by the type of crime.

In some cases it's the

7

alien who has to -- I'm sorry.

8

criminal who has to show by a preponderance that he is

9

not likely to -- to recidivate or to be a flight risk.

In some cases it's the

10

In some cases the government bears the burden by showing

11

in clear and convincing evidence.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

I think not for flight risk.

15
16

May I ask a -­
I think -- I'll check it.

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

That might be right,

Your Honor.

17

Yes.

I'm sorry, Justice -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Clarifying question.

19

For an alien who is found in the United States

20

illegally, has not been admitted, are they held under

21

1225(b) or are they held under 1226(a)?

22

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So they are held

23

under -- if they are not -- if they are not detained

24

within 100 miles of the border or within 14 days, so

25

they've been there longer than those two things, then
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

they are under 1220 -- 1226(a) and not 1226(c).

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what happens to -- I

3

don't know how many of these would exist, but an alien

4

who has resided within 14 miles of the border, not 14 -­

5

how many miles?

6
7

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:
of the border and 14 -­

8
9
10

Within a hundred miles

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Hundred miles from the

border, that's possible, who has been there for 20
years, they would still be held under 1225?

11

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So I'm sorry, Your

12

Honor.

13

on -- on -- they -- if they hadn't committed other

14

crimes, and -- and so, therefore, were not subject to

15

the mandatory detention under 1226(c).

16
17

They would be held under 1226(a).

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So this is

I'm assuming no criminal

alien.

18

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.
I'm talking about an

20

alien who has come into the United States illegally

21

without being admitted who takes up residence 50 miles

22

from the border.

23

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

The answer is they are

24

held under 1226(a) and that they get a bond hearing

25

under -- and this is at page 156a of the appendix.

burden of proof.

Let me finish my -- your

Earlier you said you were objecting to the

4

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
Are you objecting to the

6

concept that prolonged detention without reason is not

7

appropriate for these aliens?

8

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, we

believe that they -- and I don't think -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the reasons being

flight risk or danger.
GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

We believe that the -­

13

whatever due process rights that they have are met by

14

the statutory scheme which gives them an initial bond

15

hearing and then allows them, if there are changed

16

circumstances, to seek a redetermination.

17

believe that that satisfies -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And we

Except that that bond

19

hearing, that additional regulation says that the length

20

of detention is not one of the factors that justifies

21

reconsideration.

22
23

25

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

That's correct, Your

Honor, under our -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so if these are

people who have been here for decades, let's say, don't
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

you think due process would require some periodic review

2

to ensure that these people are properly being held?

3

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, we

4

don't think that.

But two things:

First of all, the

5

Ninth Circuit went beyond that and -- and -- and imposed

6

a clear and convincing evidence standard which we think

7

really does materially change the calculus and change

8

the government's burden there; and, second, we do think

9

that the initial bond hearing in conjunction with the -­

10

with the opportunity to bring forth changed

11

circumstances -- and that may be -- that could be -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Except that regulations

13

are saying that you don't consider the length of

14

detention.

15

hearings.

16

other detention, which is, at a certain point, your -­

17

your calculus changes, the balance changes when the

18

detention becomes unreasonable.

19
20

That's what a judge does in almost every

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Your Honor, so if I

can -­

21
22

But that's what a judge does in bail

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The length of detention

becomes unreasonable.

23

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Yeah.

If I could step

24

back.

We do think that the way to think about the case

25

for -- for the people who are not in the arriving aliens
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

category is that the -- as long -- what -- what the

2

Court said in Demore, and I think this is the focus of

3

Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Demore, that if the

4

purpose of detention is being served, that the

5

government is moving reason -- reasonably quickly to -­

6

to accomplish removal, and so that we are not in a

7

Zadvydas situation where the end of the government

8

detention can't be observed, then the -- then absent -­

9

absent very unusual circumstances, that -- that

10

detention is constitutional.

And so we do think that -­

11

we do think that the scheme we have in place for the

12

1226(a) individuals that Your Honor is identifying is

13

constitutional.

14

I will say that hasn't -­

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

sorry.

17
18

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I was going to shift to

something else too.

21

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

No, Your Honor, I was

going to shift to something else.

19
20

May I ask, General -- I'm

Let's do it.

Let's -- let's shift to

1226(c).

24

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

And not focus on the statute

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

so much but focus on the constitutional question, and I

2

think your brief indicates that you think that there are

3

some constitutional bounds, and so I'd like you to talk

4

to me about what those constitutional bounds are and -­

5

and when a judge would find them.

6

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, we

7

think the constitutional bound is -- is the standard

8

that Justice Kennedy's concurrence set forth in Demore,

9

and we think it is that where there be, as -- as he said

10

there -- were there to be an unreasonable delay by the

11

government -- he said the INS, but by the government in

12

pursuing and completing deportation proceedings, it

13

could become necessary, then, to inquire whether the

14

purpose of detention is not to facilitate deportation

15

but for some other reason.

16

So it seems to us that the analysis that a

17

court would undertake is, has there been some sort of

18

unusual situation or misconduct on the part of the

19

government or delay on the part of the government that

20

suggests the purpose of detention was not to effectuate

21

removal, but as long as -­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What happens if -- what

23

happens if you can't point to any particular evidence of

24

government misconduct, but that you're in a situation

25

where the government just has very, very big backlogs
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

and everything is taking a long time?

2

average would be that the government wouldn't make a

3

decision for three years.

4

well, three years is too long?

5

what kind of evidence you have; three years is too long.

6

So let's say the

Could the Court simply say,

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

It doesn't really matter

So, Your Honor, I -- I

7

think our position in that -- in that situation would be

8

that as long as the government was diligently -- we -- I

9

mean, if it were 20 years, I mean, we could go on, then,

10

of course, that might be a concern that, in fact, we

11

were no longer trying to effectuate removal.

12

would make the argument in the three years Your Honor

13

was hypothesizing, but that's not the situation we have

14

here.

I think we

12

exercise our wonderful legal imaginations and think of

13

weird instances where it's going to prove that "only if"

14

isn't literally "only if" witness.

15

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I want

16

to be clear about what I'm saying there.

17

the Attorney General has discretion to release in a

situation I was just discussing with Justice Kagan.

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Justice Kagan -­

-- I asked about it.
I was just going to

4

say, Justice Kagan had asked me to set aside the

5

statute, so it really was a constitutional analysis.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

7

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

And we don't -- we

8

really think that Congress -- this was a deliberate

9

categorical judgment by Congress based on experience

10

over a long number of years where Congress had tried to

11

deal with the concerns about recidivism and flight for

12

criminal aliens through a number of different

13

mechanisms.

14

was very hard to predict and it had very serious

15

consequences, and Congress opted for a categorical

16

judgment.

17

And what Congress found was that -- that it

18

area where your safety valve, the availability of habeas

19

corpus might come into play..

20

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Absolutely, Your

21

Honor.

And I think that goes into the interpretation of

22

constitutional avoidance, both with respect to criminal

23

aliens and arriving aliens.

24

was that it was legislating against the backdrop of

25

habeas, which provides the kind of failsafe that Justice

What Congress understood

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

Kennedy had identified in Demore.

And, therefore,

2

Congress legislated on an absolute -- with absolute

3

text, and that doesn't admit for the kind of exceptions

4

that I think Your Honor is pressing.

I understand -­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

General, to the constitutional point.

7

put Demore aside, I think we would all look at our

8

precedent and we would say, you can't just lock people

9

up without any finding of dangerousness, without any

10

finding of flight risk, for an indefinite period of

11

time, and not run into due process.

12

But if I could go back,
Because if you

Now, you have Demore, but Demore was based

13

on the assumption that it was going to be a brief time.

14

It was based on statistics that have now proved to be

15

inaccurate.

16

itself -- and you can do it through habeas proceedings

17

or whatever the procedure is -- but why the Constitution

18

itself does not set an outer bound in the way that we've

19

consistently required in, for example, civil commitment

20

cases?

21

And the question is, why the Constitution

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

All right.

So, Your

22

Honor, you've packed a lot in there, and I'd like to -­

23

I'd like to take on a number of things there.

24
25

But the answer to your last question is that
I don't think it's the focus on the amount of time
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

that's really the way the Court should look at it here.

2

And this, I think, was the insight in Justice Kennedy's

3

concurrence in Demore.

4

here in part precisely because, as I indicated at the

5

start, Congress has provided a substantial number of

6

substantive and procedural protections for individuals:

7

They have the right to lawyer at their own expense.

8

They have the right to an interpreter.

9

right to present evidence and to gather evidence and to

10

11

BIA.

They have the

They can appeal to the

They can appeal to the Court of Appeals.

12

But with that process comes time.

And I

13

think a focus on just the length of time without the

14

reasons for the delay, without looking at the fact that

15

aliens routinely and understandably file for

16

continuances, and to impose a rigid six-month rule like

17

the Court of Appeals did is really a mistake.

18

With respect to Demore, I really would like

19

to address Your Honor's concern there on a number of

20

situations.

21

provided to the Court were inaccurate, and we apologize.

22

Your Honor is right that the statistics we

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I wasn't even blaming

23

you, because I think it was partly the statistics that

24

were provided and partly what the Court did with them.

25

It doesn't really matter who was to blame or who wasn't
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19

to blame.

I was just suggesting that, in fact,

2

Demore -- Demore says that the average is five months;

3

it turns out that the average is more like a little bit

4

over a year.

5

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, so

I -- the reason why I think Demore still is good is this

7

reason:

I think Demore rested on two pillars.

8

First was the judgment that flight risk and

9

recidivism are real problems and that IJ's are really

10

bad at predicting, and that, therefore, Congress could

11

make a categorical judgment in this area of immigration

12

law that mandatory detention was appropriate.

13

And, second, that unlike Zadvydas, the

14

purpose of the detention was still being served.

15

purpose of the detention was to effectuate removal, and

16

the detention was not going to be permanent and it was

17

not going to be indefinite.

18

The

Those are true.

It is true that this Court assumed

19

incorrectly that the length of detention was five and a

20

half months.

21

had already been in -- had been detained for more than

22

six months, for 197 days, and the Court was sending that

23

individual back for an IJ hearing and a BIA appeal.

24

so even under the Court's erroneous assumption that

25

there was going to be five and a half months tacked on,

But in Kim -- in Demore itself, the alien

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

we're talking about a detention for a year.

2

Now, with respect to the time limits, they

3

are not trivial.

4

matters, and we recognize that.

5

for -- for the Demore figures is around 233 days now,

6

but it's gone from seven to nine months over the years.

7

And the average time, which is not what we think the

8

Court -­

9
10
11
12

These are serious -- these are serious

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The current median time

So when is it, in theory

-­
GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

-- it's more like 10

to 12 months.

13

I'm sorry.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- when it's not the

15

alien's fault, and you seem to suggest that if budgetary

16

matters or personnel matters are what are inflicting the

17

delay that that's okay.

Is there any -- you said 20

18

years is the end point.

But given that we have a due

19

process right not to be held indefinitely, even though

20

it may have a distant point of release somewhere in an

21

unknown period, because the government now, I

22

understand, if a alien asks for an adjournment, BIA

23

judges who are overbooked are sometimes taking months to

24

give them another date.

25

At what point does the government's behavior
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

come into this analysis?

2
3

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I

think the government's behavior -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Intentionally or not.

5

mean, I would assume that if the government was just

6

delaying because it wanted to, you would say that's

7

unconstitutional.

8
9

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:
Honor.

I

Absolutely, Your

And that is -­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

But at what

11

point does indefinite, albeit with a lengthy, far-off

12

detention date, become unconstitutional?

13

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, we

14

don't think that the mere date itself is what makes it

15

unconstitutional.

16

But to be clear -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

What makes it

17

unconstitutional in my mind is the unreasonable delay or

18

detention.

19
20

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Right.

The -- so a

couple of points on that, Your Honor.

21

First of all, the -- it is not our view that

22

most of the delays that we are talking about here in the

23

lengthy cases are situations that are resulting from

24

government-resource problems or things of that nature.

25

A lot -- the record indicates that aliens routinely seek
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

continuances and they seek multiple continuances.

2

they do that for good reason, which is to build a

3

record.

4

discretionary relief.

5

discretionary relief, then they're going to want to

6

build the record.

7

And

What most of the aliens here are seeking is
And if they're seeking

So I don't think the record is -- is that

8

most of the delay is IJ, lack of immigration judges or

9

BIA resources.

And, indeed, UR expedites the

10

proceedings that involve detained aliens.

11

is a -- a government policy to deal with Your Honor's

12

question.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so that

Assuming -- assuming that

14

there is a constitutional limit of the type that's been

15

discussed, is that -- do you think that can be addressed

16

in a class action, or is it something that can be

17

addressed only in individual habeas cases?

18

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, we

19

think it's clearly the latter, and we really think that

20

that is one of the major flaws of the Ninth Circuit's

21

decision, is that it adopted a class-wide rigid rule

22

that applies to aliens no matter what is the cause of

23

the delay, no matter whether the alien is a criminal

24

alien or arriving alien, no matter whether the alien is

25

seeking discretionary relief or not discretionary
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

relief.

That one-size-fits-all approach is not the

2

right way to do it.

3

as-applied challenges through habeas proceedings, which

4

is what the Court -­

5

The way to do it is in individual,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I don't quite

6

understand that.

Why couldn't a court, whether it's the

7

Ninth Circuit or whether it's this Court in reviewing

8

the Ninth Circuit, say, here are the constitutional

9

guidelines.

Here's the way to -- it might -- it might

10

not be a one-size-fits-all.

11

limit, but the ability to go beyond that in individual

12

cases, but to set those -- to set those guideposts and

13

then let the individual determinations take place.

14

It might be a presumptive

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So in theory, Your

15

Honor, the short answer is the Due Process Clause

16

doesn't usually permit that kind of broad-based approach

17

that doesn't take advantage -- take cognizance of the

18

various differences between the aliens on the ground.

19

think, for example, the difference between -­

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, wouldn't it be better

21

to set some guideposts that everybody in the country

22

would know to follow rather than having one suit pop up

23

here and one suit pop up here and another in another

24

place and everybody would be treated differently?

25

does not seem like a good immigration system.
Alderson Reporting Company

That

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So the first thing I

2

would say, Your Honor, is that the one thing that we

3

know shouldn't be the case is what the Ninth Circuit has

4

done, which is the opposite of that, which is apply a

5

single standard to everybody regardless of -- regardless

6

of the cause of the delay.

7

very concern that the Court -- that the dissent in

8

Zadvydas, Justice Kennedy's dissent, and then the

9

majority in Demore highlighted, which is that kind of

10

rigid rule creates an incentive for an alien to delay,

11

and we wouldn't adopt the clear-and-convincing standard,

12

which -­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, this gets at the

Well, I wasn't -- I wasn't

14

suggesting a rule that was quite as rigid as that.

But

15

I was suggesting more that the Court, say, pick up some

16

of your language in your brief and say that the

17

detention has to serve the purposes for which the

18

detention is meant.

19

a number -- nine months, a year -­

And, presumptively, that is -- pick

20

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Your Honor -­

-- six months, whatever,

22

something pretty reasonable, but only presumptively if

23

there is some exceptional circumstance that could be

24

extended.

25

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25

think it would be within the Court's power to do that.

2

We don't think that's the way we would approach.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

No, no, no.

I'm sorry -­

We think the Court

would have power to do that -­

Sorry.

that's the way the Court should do it.

we're not going to say, you know, what the situation is

24

going to be for any of the members of this class, but

25

here are our thoughts about how individual determination

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

I agree with that,

Your Honor, and that is why we don't think that's what

the courts should do.

be clear, I think the Court has the power to give

6

guidance, but we don't think that that is the -- the

7

approach that's most consistent with the Due Process

Clause or the way to think about these categories of

9

cases.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think -- and so -- I mean, to

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

I'm sorry.

Can I just

finish -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Is that -- go ahead.
We do suggest in our

16

brief that there are -- there are indicators, you know,

17

that -- that 90 percent of the IJ hearings are done

18

within 14 months, and 90 percent of the BIA proceedings

19

are done within 19 months.

20

would -- those -- we would offer those to the Court, not

21

as -- as indication that the Due Process Clause has been

22

violated, but those are situations in which one might

23

reasonably, in a -- in a as-applied challenge take

24

advantage of -- take Justice Kennedy's opinion up on its

25

standard and -- and do the kind of searching inquiry

And what I think those -- we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1
2

that we would think about.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We are in an upended

3

world when we think 14 months or 19 months is a

4

reasonable time to detain a person.

5
6

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:
-- I totally understand -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

9

So, Your Honor, what I

-- understand that.
But what I'm trying to

suggest to Your Honor is that that is part and parcel of

10

an overall scheme that offers tremendous process to the

11

individual alien, and that part of the reason for that

12

delay is the government -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you would think that

14

that process, at least with respect to 1226(b), is to

15

ensure that the person is not a flight risk or a danger.

16

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Your Honor, it is -­

17

it is to effectuate Congress's categorical judgment that

18

those -- either that there -- that they -- is a risk, a

19

flight risk, and a risk of recidivism, and that it's

20

very hard to predict those.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I have a couple of

22

questions I'd like to ask, actually, because it's a

23

complicated statute.

24

you have some extra -­

25

And you can correct me.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
Alderson Reporting Company

Yeah.

I think

I'll -- I'll

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

give you extra time to answer the questions if -­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

We're -- we're talking

3

about three categories.

The first category is people

4

who show up on the border.

5

looked at that.

6

prevent interpreting the statute from saying, of course,

7

you have a bail hearing after six months, and under

8

whatever standards.

9

Circuit standards, et cetera.

That's mostly 1225.

I've

I don't see any words there that would

I'm not going with the Ninth
I don't see the words.

10

So put that in your mind, because you're going to tell

11

me the words in a minute.

12

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

But the more important

14

part, I think, is the criminal part.

15

divided my mind into three -- three stages.

16

And there I have

Stage one, the person is released from jail,

17

let's say.

18

him up.

19

says, I have a right to stay in the United States, and

20

the AG says you don't.

21

we have the "only if" language.

22

And the statute says, Attorney General, pick

And then there is a period of time where he

And during that period of time

And then we go to the period of there is a

23

final removal order, and that's a 90-day order.

24

there I see no way around the statute.

25

you.

And

I agree with

That 90 days, you cannot get out of the statute.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

I mean, it's definite.

2

Then the removal period ends, and we are in

3

Zadvydas.

And unlike you, I don't think Demore

4

overruled Zadvydas.

5

period of time.

Demore was talking about a brief

6

So now, let's start with the criminal.

7

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Okay.

Let's look at that statute.

As you would like to interpret it, during that first

10

period -- remember, the second period I'm with you, the

11

90 days.

12

You got to let him go after six months.

13

talking about the first period.

The third period settled.

14
it.

16

the Zadvydas thing.

I might be wrong.

I go back and did it.

(Laughter.)

18

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I trust you on that.

I might be wrong.

20

often wrong in what I think I said.

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

I wrote

I think it said six months.

17

24

So we are

If there's a -- I think -- take my word for

15

23

That's Zadvydas.

I'm

All right?

So -- so we are in the

first part.
Now, on that first part, it's a pretty odd
statute that can say you don't have -- you -- we can
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

keep you for two years, you know, or three, or four.

2

You've just been out of jail, hey, your term is over.

3

Your punishment's over, but you've got four more years

4

here of punishment while we try to get to stage two,

5

which is called the removal order.

6

bothering me.

7

That's what's

It is bothering me that, as a lawyer, it

8

produces an odd statute.

9

interpret the Constitution, I'd say what happened to the

10

notion that you do let people out on bail when, in fact,

11

they're not a flight risk.

12

for four more years?

13

Maybe there is a way around that "only if" language.

14

But the concern is the same.

15

As a person who tries to

And how can they be punished

Maybe it's the Constitution.

So now -- now you have all my questions out

16

there, and I -- I know they're -- they're -- do what you

17

can.

18

(Laughter.)

19

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Okay.

And I'll try to

20

be -- I'll try to be brief because I'm cognizant of the

21

Chief Justice's generosity here.

22

I do think that the statute squarely

23

forecloses it at both stages, Your Honor.

Yeah.

Alderson Reporting Company

If we're at

to the initial detention.

may, may, may, may, may, but then in the criminal side,

6

see, on the criminal side -- I'm not talking about

I -- I only want to say one more thing about the

statute, because I -- I don't want to belabor the point.

17

But five months -- four months after the Zadvydas

18

decision, Congress passed the Patriot Act.

The Patriot Act didn't only -- it clearly

20

authorized long-term detention in six-month intervals;

it said six months.

cases, which was speaking directly to Zadvydas, but also

23

in pending cases, that is, cases like this one.

It did it not only in post order

specifically authorizes long-term detention, it is

7

limited to national security cases, in pending cases,

really makes -- makes the government's interpretation

9

hard to make sense of, because why -- you know, under

whether the enforcement mechanism for the right we are

Excuse me, Your

I apologize for that.
This Court has held that there is a hearing

22

requirement as a matter of due process for people in

23

pretrial detention, for people facing civil commitment,

24

et cetera, and that is not dependent on their filing a

25

habeas petition.

The Due Process Clause gives that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

right, and so the hearing has to be provided whether or

2

not you file a habeas, and so similarly here, if the Due

3

Process Clause requires a hearing at some point in time,

4

it should require that hearing whether or not the

5

detainee has a lawyer who they can get to file a habeas

petition.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But suppose the Due Process

8

Clause requires something a little bit more complex than

9

a simple date.

Suppose that it does require a little

10

bit of individualized determination as to whether it

11

should be six months or, in a particular case, a little

12

bit longer, how does that get decided and what vehicle?

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Well, I still think the

vehicle would be this case, and I don't think the fact

15

that it's a class action is a barrier to that.

16

have -- we have sought relief on behalf of people

17

detained for years, and if this Court said, for example,

18

that a detainee who is engaged in dilatory tactics is

19

not entitled to a danger and flight risk determination

20

in their case, that's relief that would then be

21

available because you'd still get the inquiry, right?

22

Because somebody has to look at the case at some point

and see, is this a case where there's dilatory tactics,

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Well, but the decision of

to affirm on an alternative ground, which is that it's

unconstitutional, so I don't know how far you can get

with that argument.

22

But we could -- if you want to be very

strict about what's before us, we could simply say the

25

and remand for further proceedings to the Ninth Circuit.

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

I think

that -- that -- that would be consistent with the

But let me also give a substantive answer to
Your Honor -­

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- and it would also

be consistent with the way the Ninth Circuit interpreted

10

We do not have the

11

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

We've argued it in

Section I of our brief, but you're correct that the

13

Ninth Circuit didn't rule on a constitutional ground.

Absolutely, Your Honor.

15

The second point I want to make, though, is

16

everybody in the class, in our view, is entitled to an

17

inquiry.

decide, is this a detention which remains reasonable?

19

Does it continue to be reasonable in relation to its

purpose?

Someone has to look at the detention and

That's our argument.

21

Many of the people under the injunction

don't get out.

About 30 percent of them don't even get

another 30 percent don't actually get out under the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does that represent

2

a typical remedy in habeas to require inquiries in every

3

case?

4

habeas is either you can be detained or you can't be

5

detained, as opposed to a procedural across-the-board

6

requirement of a hearing.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but I would have thought

7

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

No, Your Honor.

That particular case was a habeas, but it

convincing, because that's the standard used in

11

significant deprivations of liberty and for periodic

12

hearings and such.

13

But the most important thing to us is that

14

it be a meaningful hearing.

So there has to be a way

for the detainee to raise, I was not -- spent even a day

I was not sentenced to even a day in jail, and

Alderson Reporting Company

My friend had

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

suggested that that hearing that's available, even

2

perhaps only as a matter of the Due Process Clause, that

3

it's sufficient for it to focus on whether the

4

government has engaged -- you know, has run proceedings

5

very quickly so that if a person is engaged in good

6

faith litigation of a substantial defense that, in the

7

government's view, as I understand it, that's a

8

sufficient justification for detention.

9

And that is actually the most serious

10

problem with their view on the Due Process Clause.

11

Because if a person has a substantial defense and they

12

are litigating that in good faith, that does not

13

necessarily mean that their detention is serving a

14

reasonable purpose.

15

correlated to it; right?

16

substantial defense, then it's far more likely that they

17

are not a flight risk because they're going to want to

18

go to immigration court to maintain their immigration

19

status.

20

In fact, it's almost inversely
I mean, if a person has a

And similarly, if a person has a substantial

21

defense, that means they're not in a class of people

22

that Congress wanted to mandate the deportation of,

23

which probably means they have a less serious crime.

24

you are an aggravated felon, for example, you're not

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that the flight

risk and danger to the community are both continuums?

4

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Yes, Your Honor, but I

5

think it has to be reasonably related to the detention.

6

So -- excuse me, Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, so if you have the

8

situation where the person is litigating in -- for -- in

9

a -- there has been lengthy litigation, but the judge

10

can't say this is done in bad faith or it's dilatory,

11

it's just very lengthy and it keeps going on and on and

12

on and on, and then you have a flight risk that's

13

someplace on this scale and you have a risk to the

14

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

I mean, that's -­
What did they say?
That's our statutory

15

argument.

The government says that the regulations,

16

even though -- even though the person is in front of an

17

immigration judge, the government says that the

18

regulations prevent the immigration judge from having

19

the power to release the person on bail.

20

though -­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

So even

So it's the regulations;

22

it's not the statute.

just saying -- you're going to agree with this, which is

24

the problem.

25

So we could say -- I mean, I'm

I need a disagreement.
But the -- the -- you could say they do it

The language doesn't forbid it.

It

2

throws you into 1229(a).

statute as saying for purposes of a bail hearing, the

4

1229(a) starts tomorrow.

It's possible to interpret the

5

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, sir.
Okay.

So we could do that

7

one on the statute if it is correct that you should not

8

hold a person for years in the United States without

9

giving him a chance to get back to his freedom through a

10

bail hearing, if appropriate.

11

Okay.

(c).

Now, I'm still stuck on (c).

12

And the reason, the value of a statutory interpretation

13

is that we're dealing with tens of thousands, hundreds

14

of thousands, or millions of people, possibly.

15

an administrative agency organization, and they need a

16

rule.

17

statute, you can give them a rule.

18

can have lots of discretion in it through bail hearings,

They need a rule.

Yes.

to work on the language, Your Honor.

8

First, assuming nobody is willing to accept

10

that it could be interpreted, at least to have some

11

reasonableness limit in it, whether a six-month rule or

12

another one.

13

But if -- if I can't persuade Your Honors of

that, the Due Process Clause often -- the court does use

rules of administrability where they are needed to

create uniformity of practice and -­

But the Court could also remand for

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm a little bit surprised

2

that you answered the question that way, because it

3

seems to me that it's quite obvious what the court below

4

thinks as to the constitutional question where did they

5

get this from, except as an understanding of what the

6

Constitution required.

7
8

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Yes, Your Honor.

The

court, I think -­

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, maybe they

10

didn't have the courage of their convictions.

11

if they do think it's unconstitutional, they could have

12

said so rather than stretching the principles of

13

constitutional avoidance to the length they did.

14

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

I mean,

Your Honor, I won't

15

pretend to understand what was in the heads of the -­

16

the Ninth Circuit judges, except that they had seen

17

prolonged detention problems for years.

18

decided in 2005 that mandatory detention applied only to

19

expeditious removal proceedings, and there continued to

20

be cases floating up, individual habeas cases, four

21

years.

22

They had

I had a client four and a half years

23

detained by the government, was appealing seven years,

24

and that was part of why the court thought we needed a

25

-- a system, whether -- I would suggest even if it's on
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

60
1

due process grounds, you need a system that is

2

administrable.

3

And, you know, the person doesn't even know

4

-- the judge doesn't know when to pull the case off the

5

shelf and look at whether or not to conduct the inquiry,

6

Justice Alito, that you were talking about, unless you

7

have some kind of trigger that allows them to do that.

8

And the time periods -- and if you look at,

9

say, the Third Circuit experience, right, they said in

10

2011 that it had a reasonableness limit as a statutory

11

matter, and that then there should be an inquiry into

12

whether or not the detention remains permissible.

13

they say we reject the time period because of Demore -­

14

in a -- it would be inconsistent with Demore.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This is just

So it's actually quite similar.
You know, what we're saying is unless

25

unless removal is imminent, there -- there's a two-week

should look into conduct an inquiry to see whether or

maybe it would be good to have a nine-month, 12-month

them can't do, go directly to the immigration judge and

say, can you please now conduct an individualized

inquiry -­

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, the

7

problem is that that looks an awful lot like drafting a

8

statute or a regulation.

9

that's quite a leap.

And it -- it seems to me that

10

We -- our job is to read the statute, and if

11

it presents -- if it's unconstitutional, that's our job.

12

But we can't just write a different statute because we

13

think it would be more administrable.

14

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Your Honor, I think it's

15

not that different from what the Court did in a number

16

of cases, in Riverside v. McLaughlin, in Schnackenberg,

17

where the Court said six months is the maximum time that

18

you can go to prison without a jury trial.

I actually thought that there was a

colorable claim that, because Congress specifically

authorized six months of detention, prolonged detention

in national security cases, you could actually read the

statute that way.

But obviously, that doesn't seem to

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:
Justice.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

I'll be brief.
I wanted to make first a short point on the

Patriot Act to shore up the construction of 1226(c).
There are two, as Justice Alito suggested,

23

two fundamental differences with the Patriot Act.

24

first is that it allows for a certification.

5

It can't be delegated, but then that is not
It's very different from the 1226(c) where

The second piece of the Patriot Act that

6

makes it very different is that it overrides Zadvydas

7

and actually permits the attorney general to provide for

8

detention, even when there's no foreseeable likelihood

9

of relief.

10

And so it's -- it is a situation in which

11

there is, of course, some overlap, as one would expect

12

in a situation -- in a series of statutes dealing with

13

terrorists, but the -- there is no superfluity, and

14

they're dealing with very different things.

15

extraordinary powers to the attorney general for a -- a

12

who has a family in the United States is, in the view of

13

the government, locked up for five years without any

14

hearing whatsoever, without any opportunity for bail,

15

even though he can get out of it simply by abandoning

16

his family and returning to another country, is that the

17

position of the government as to what this statute

18

means?

19

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, the

20

position of the government is that that individual would

21

have an individualized as-applied challenge in a habeas

22

proceeding, but that is not what should drive the

23

statutory interpretation, which is principally what we

24

are talking about here.

25

And not only is it correct -- is that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

correct for the reasons Justice Kennedy suggested about

2

his -- his Christmas visit, but that has been the

3

interpretation of the statute -- of -- of that language

4

in the statute since 1917.

5

formulation exists -- was in the original statute in

6

1917.

7

It has always been understood -­

It was in the statute that was enacted in 1952.

8

10

The "shall be detained for"

JUSTICE KAGAN:
General.

It's odd language, though,

I mean, easy enough to say pending a removal

decision, or pending an asylum decision.

11

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

12

And that's the -­

And they didn't say that.

14

application.

16

Like, why would you say that, to say

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

And that's precisely,

17

Your Honor, why I wanted to invoke the history.

18

because that is how it's been understood for a hundred

19

years, for literally 100 years or 99 years, and -­

20

and -- and it has always been understood that the

21

exclusive way to get into the country while those

22

proceedings are pending is through parole.

23

It's

Now, the government does use parole for a

lot of these individuals, and so they do -- the
