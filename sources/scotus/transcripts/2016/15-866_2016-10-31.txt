ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

We'll hear argument

MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

Congress did not intend to grant a

11

century-long copyright monopoly in cheerleader uniform

12

design.

13

conclusion.

14

And there are three points that support that

First, by subjecting two-dimensional

15

pictures and graphics as well as sculptures to Section

16

101 separability test, Congress made clear that

17

two-dimensional and three-dimensional designs must be

18

analyzed for separability.

19

Second, under Section 101's text, the

20

dispositive questions are twofold:

21

features can be identified separately from the useful

22

article's utilitarian aspects; and second, whether they

23

can exist independently, that is, the design features do

24

not add to or change the useful article's utilitarian --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Whether the deign

Why, in this case, would

we even need to get to any question of separability?

2

What was submitted was a two-dimensional artwork.

may not be like Mondrian, but it is chevrons and other

4

things.

8

just saying these zigzag designs -- and you can choose

10

design.

11

So why isn't this a -- a case of not -- not

12

part -- the pictorial graphic element is not part of the

13

design of the cheerleader's uniform; it's superimposed

14

on it.

It's reproduced on it.

15

MR. BURSCH:

It's applied to it.

There two reasons, Justice

16

Ginsburg.

17

designer who designs a military uniform.

18

military uniform, they design the best desert camouflage

19

that's been ever designed in the history of the world.

20

And they submit it to the copyright office, and they

21

don't claim the design in the uniform, they only claim

22

copyright in the design on the uniform.

23

First, consider the example where you have a
And on that

There is no question they would have the

24

copyright in the design, but the courts would still look

25

to see whether that adds to the utilitarian aspects of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

that uniform such that that design copyright holder

2

could not prevent the military from producing a military

3

uniform that uses that design.

4

That's why it's so important to understand

5

that in Section 101, not only two-dimensional -- or

6

three-dimensional, but also two-dimensional designs are

7

subject to separability.

8
9

And there's a second reason, Justice
Ginsburg.

What you're referring to, generally, is kind

10

of the area of fabric design.

11

fabric design is the -- the flowers on the fabric in the

12

Folio Impressions case that we reprint on page 7 of our

13

reply brief.

14

And a good example of

And those flowers, you could expand the

15

design, you could contract the design, you can make any

16

article of clothing out of it whatsoever, you could

17

rotate it 45 degrees, and it always works functionally

18

the same.

19

Here, when you're talking about these

20

cheerleader uniform designs, the arrangement of the

21

color blocks and the chevrons and the stripes, if you

22

made it smaller and put it in the center of a uniform,

23

it would no longer have the slimming effects.

24

wouldn't make the wearer look taller.

25

put it on a hat or a lunch box, it wouldn't have those

Alderson Reporting Company

It

I mean, if you

functions.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But they have put it on

3

those other items.

That's their whole point, that

4

they've taken the pictorial design and applied it not

5

just to a -- by the way, this is not conceding, I think,

6

by them.

7

this isn't obvious and -- and some of your amici brief

8

seemed to take that position, that if all we're looking

9

at is a picture of this color blocks and stripes, that

They'll talk on their own and tell me -- that

10

it may be too obvious to qualify for copyright

11

protection, or not original enough, whatever.

12

But my point is that they already have done

13

that.

They've taken the designs and not put it on a

14

cheerleading uniform.

15

They've put it on both tops and bottoms.

They've put it on sweats.

16

So what does that do for you?

17

MR. BURSCH:

Let me respond to both of those

18

points, that the obvious in the second; first, the other

19

garments.

20

To the extent they're putting it on other

21

garments, if you look closely at those pictures, the

22

design changes.

23

to the extent that it remains similar, it's because, for

24

example, the warmup jackets are putting those lines in

25

the same place.

It's not the same design anymore.

Alderson Reporting Company

Similarly, you've got in -- in these

MR. BURSCH:

That's why you have

We completely agree.

And

22

that's why it's so important that you focus on the

23

statutory text, because under the exists-independently

24

requirement that we cite -- this is right from Section

25

Well, that design has the

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose you have a Picasso

painting or Mondrian or Klee, and suppose they're alive

12

and they licensed the use of their picture on a garment

13

and it does just what you say:

14

Mondrian just completely captures the shape of the

15

article you want.

16

it means that it can be copied?

This Picasso painting or

The fact that it completely captures

MR. BURSCH:

No, it does not, because the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What's the difference

20

between Mondrian or Picasso and these -- and these

lines?

22

MR. BURSCH:

Because I could take the

23

Picasso and I could just have it in a frame on the

24

chest, or I could expand it to the entire breadth of the

that with the Picasso and it would still look like a

it would no longer make the cheerleader look taller and

thinner.

And if you

If you turned one of these designs 45 degrees,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How is your argument

10

different from this tuxedo shirt that the government

11

talks about -- it's on page 10 of the government's

12

brief --

13

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- where the lines really do

15

have to be just in a particular place on the piece of

16

apparel in order for it to make any sense at all and, in

17

there, that was found to be copyrightable?

18

Is that -- is there -- there any difference

19

between the tuxedo shirt and this?

20

MR. BURSCH:

Well, there are differences,

21

and I think even the government would tell you, if you

22

asked them that question, that that design wouldn't

23

prevent you from making the tuxedo.

24

talking about here is making the cheerleader uniform,

25

the actual three-dimensional cheerleader uniform that

Alderson Reporting Company

And what we're

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

you wear, and that's the lesson of one Section -- or

2

Section 113.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.

But it prevents you --

4

it prevents you from making this T-shirt with these

5

lines on it in the same way that you're saying nobody

6

should be able to make a short dress --

MR. BURSCH:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the point --

-- with those particular

lines in that particular place.
MR. BURSCH:

13

the hypothetical I used with Justice Ginsburg you could

14

have a copyright in the camouflage design.

15

copyright doesn't extend to prevent you from making the

16

useful article depicted.

17

We don't contest that Varsity
We wouldn't contest in

But that

That's where the line stops.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I guess I'm not

18

sure about your -- does that mean if you can have a

19

copyright in the tuxedo shirt design that somebody

20

couldn't draw a tuxedo shirt because that's copyrighted

21

two-dimensional?

22

MR. BURSCH:

Correct, right.

You could not

23

replicate the design, but you could make the tuxedo.

24

That's the lesson of Jack Adelman in Section 1.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you're saying you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

couldn't make the tuxedo shirt -- is that correct? -- or

2

you could?

3

MR. BURSCH:

You could not.

Let's take it

4

back to the cheerleader uniform, and then bring it back

5

to the text of the statute.

6

We don't contest that Varsity could take

7

these designs and put it on a notebook, put it on a

8

lunchbox, put it on a hat, and no one could copy that.

9

That's clearly within the subject matter of their

10

copyright.

11

What they can't do is prevent someone from

12

making the entire uniform.

13

requires that is because you have this

14

identified-separately requirement.

15

And the reason the statute

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So are you suing them

16

just for the pictures that are in their catalogue?

17

that what you're suing them for?

18

MR. BURSCH:

10

No problem, Justice Sotomayor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

you from -- you think you can sell your uniforms

12

anywhere.

13

MR. BURSCH:

Correct.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what can't you do?

15

If we don't agree with you, if we agree with them that

16

this is a -- eligible for copyright absent some other

17

disqualification, like obviousness or lack of creativity

18

or whatever else, okay, assume we agree with them; what

19

can they stop you from doing?

20

MR. BURSCH:

Well, actually, if you agree

21

with them that they have a copyright, then you're

22

agreeing with us, too, because we all agree they have a

23

copyright in the sketch.

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

MR. BURSCH:

Okay.

They have a copyright in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

image.

Our position is that they cannot then take that

2

image and prohibit us from making the actual

3

three-dimensional uniform.

4

under Section 101 is because the design neither can be

5

identified separately, nor can exist independently,

6

which are the statutory requirements of the "utilitarian

7

aspects" of the cheerleader uniform.

8
9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So but if I could just go

back and make sure I understand my question about the
tuxedo shirt.

11

MR. BURSCH:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

And the reason for that

Yes.
If I have a copyright in the

design of the tuxedo shirt, not in a tuxedo --

14

MR. BURSCH:

Correct.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- I have a copyright in the

16

design of a tuxedo shirt, can I prevent other people

17

from manufacturing tuxedo shirts?

18

MR. BURSCH:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

Yes.
So why isn't that exactly

the same?

21

MR. BURSCH:

Because --

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because here, I have a

23

design in a copyright dress, and now I'm trying to

24

prevent other people from manufacturing that cheerleader

25

dress with that design.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

MR. BURSCH:

Because then that's like

2

manufacturing the tuxedo.

And what Section 113(b) says

3

is that all of the copyright law with respect to this

4

kind of issue, that was --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't understand why it's

6

like manufacturing a tuxedo.

It seems as though it's

7

like manufacturing the thing that I have the design in.

8

I have design in the -- I have a design of a tuxedo

9

shirt, so you can't make a tuxedo shirt.

I have a

10

design in a cheerleader dress, so you can't make the

11

cheerleader dress.

12

MR. BURSCH:

It has to do with the very

13

careful statutory requirement that they exist

14

independently.

15

to or change the "utilitarian aspects" of the article.

16

What that means is the feature can't add

When you're talking about the tuxedo design,

17

it's not adding anything functional to the T-shirt.

18

It's simply putting a design on it.

19

about these designs on a cheerleader uniform, it

20

advances a number of utilitarian designs, and let me

21

just tick those off quickly.

22

When you're talking

First, it changes how the wearer is

23

perceived through optical illusion.

24

the things that I've been referring to:

25

lines on the side, the waist-narrowing Vs, the

Alderson Reporting Company

And that's some of
the slimming

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

Müller-Lyer lines --

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that the same for all

five of the --

4

MR. BURSCH:

All five.

And I'll tick

5

through this list, and then let's look at the uniforms

6

and I can show you how they do that.

7

The second, like all uniforms, Justice

8

Kagan, it actually identifies the cheerleader as a

9

cheerleader, which was Judge McKeague's point, Judge

10

Cleland's point below.

11

were wearing wrestling singlets, no one would identify

12

them as cheerleaders.

13

Because if these cheerleaders

And uniforms have a special identification

14

function.

15

scene mixed up with civilians, and it's the military

16

uniforms that identify them as members of the military

17

that tells you whether the rules of war apply to them or

18

not.

19
20
21

You think about military people who are in a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought conveying

information doesn't make an article useful.
MR. BURSCH:

I don't think that optical

22

illusions are conveying information.

23

identification is conveying optical illusion.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't think that

Well, you said -- you

said a function of the cheerleader -- cheerleader's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

dress is to identify the person as a cheerleader.

2

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

That's a second function.

3

So let me first make clear, the optical illusions isn't

4

conveying information; it's actually causing you to see

5

the person differently than they actually are.

6

minimum, that doesn't fall within this.

7

So at a

I think with the identification, that allows

8

you to sort people.

9

information like facts and figures.

10

That's different than conveying

In addition, Your Honor, the conveyance of

11

information is actually something that has to be

12

considered as part of the exists-independently prong.

13

And you can see this on page 2 of the blue brief where

14

we have Section 101, both the "pictorial graphic" and

15

"sculptural works" definition and the "useful article"

16

definition.

17

And if you start with the "useful article"

18

definition, to determine whether something is a useful

19

article in the first instance, you ask whether it has an

20

intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to

21

portray the appearance of the article or to convey

22

information.

23

So portraying the appearance and conveying

24

information are utilitarian functions, but if that's the

25

only thing that they do, then it's not a useful article.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

But once you've decided that a garment like a

2

cheerleader uniform is a useful article, now you turn to

3

the separability test.

4

definition right above the "useful article" definition,

5

and there you are measuring the features against the

6

utilitarian aspects of the article.

7
8
9

So now we look at the PGS

It doesn't say only the intrinsic
utilitarian functions; it's any "utilitarian aspect."
So having made the first decision, yes, this

10

garment is a useful article, the statute requires us to

11

consider all the "utilitarian aspects" of the article.

12

And -- and that has to be the case or otherwise, again,

13

military uniforms, their identifying functions, you

14

could have lay people making military uniform designs

15

and barring the government from ever being able to

16

manufacture those uniforms themselves, even if everyone

17

agrees that that is a useful thing.

18

Two other quick things on functionality.

19

These designs also define the uniform's style line and

20

their actual three-dimensional shape.

21

So, Justice Kagan, the -- the zigzag that

22

they have on the bottom of 299A and 299B on page 4 of

23

our -- our blue brief, it's actually defining the shape,

24

and everyone agrees that the shape of a uniform can

25

never be copyrighted.

There is no dispute about that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

The last thing --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the -- the

3

shape was the same on all of these.

4

designs, five different designs, same shape.

5

MR. BURSCH:

No.

We have different

The -- maybe this would be

6

a good time to turn to the pictures on pages 4 to 5 of

7

the blue brief, because these are the actual copyright

8

deposits involved.

9

you a moment to pull up pages 4 and 5 of the blue brief.

10

And what you can see -- I'll give

On page 4, you have two of the deposits.

11

This is 299A on the bottom, 299B on the top, and that

12

zigzag actually defines the shape.

13

functional utility of covering up the seams and making

14

that waistband stronger, not allowing it to stretch when

15

the cheerleader puts it on and off.

16

And it also has the

The stripes at the top that define the shape

17

of the collar, again, that's not copyrightable, also

18

cover up seams.

19

That stripe that goes across diagonally

20

right there that separates the white color block from

21

the red color block, those two color blocks have to be

22

stitched together, and what they do is they put those

23

stitches on the outside so that it'll be smooth on the

24

inside where the cheerleader is, and they have to cover

25

up those sales with a stripe.

So all these things

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

are -- are functional.

2

So now let's look --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So do you get a

4

different -- a different result if, instead of stitched,

5

the design is applied?

6

MR. BURSCH:

If it's -- it's subliminated,

7

which is something that they -- they've talked about.

8

It's no different with respect to the optical illusion

9

or the identifying function, because if you print the

10

Let's focus now on page 5.

The bottom

drawing there is number 815.

This is the red one with

14

the blue stripes that go down the side.

15

stripes on the side, just like the Stella McCartney

slimmer and more curvy than they actually are.

think is eligible for copyright in this picture?

3

MR. BURSCH:

I think the copyright

eligibility in this picture is the design, so long as

5

it's not being used to prevent the manufacturer of the

6

useful article that it was intended to be -- to appear

7

on.

Like I said, they --

MR. BURSCH:

Well, I -- I think they agree
If you look at --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. BURSCH:

If you look at page 22

Yeah.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what can't you do,

The -- the

And I -- I'm -- I'm talking so much about

7

cheerleader uniforms.

8

just for a moment because the purpose of having a

9

separability test under Section 101 is to make sure that

10

anything that enhances in any way the functionality of a

11

useful article is not within the subject matter of

12

copyright.

13

I want to focus back on the text

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess that's the

14

question, is it really in any way, because the opposite

15

way of reading this statute is that the "utilitarian

16

aspects" of the article that you're talking about in

17

terms of the separability test?

18

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That -- that those

20

"utilitarian aspects" should be understood to encompass

21

only the utilitarian functions that make something a

22

useful article in the first place, which means that they

23

should be held to exclude things that relate to the --

24

portraying the appearance of the article or things that

25

relates to conveying information, and that seems to me a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

pretty good -- I mean, it's a confusing statute, but it

2

seems to me a pretty good holistic understanding of this

3

statute.

4

But that is what this statute is trying to

5

do, is to say there are certain kinds of things that

6

might in a broad sense be considered utilitarian, which

7

has to do with portraying appearance or conveying

8

information, that, for this inquiry, we want you to

9

exclude, that the separability test does not relate to

10

those kinds of things.

11

MR. BURSCH:

And, Justice Kagan, that would

12

be a possible policy that Congress could have adopted,

13

but that's not what the statute says.

14

When you're applying the separability test,

15

you're comparing the features to the "utilitarian

16

aspects" of the article, not the intrinsic utilitarian

17

function.

18

but all "utilitarian aspects" of the article.

19

and if you excluded things like uniform's identifying

20

functions, then someone would be able to prevent the

21

military from producing camouflage uniforms if they got

22

to that design first, and that's exactly the opposite of

23

what Congress intended.

24
25

Not the ones that made it a useful article,
And --

You know, in fact, there has been a hundred
years of proposed legislation where people have tried --

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the reason why

2

camouflage is such a good example for your side is that

3

camouflage actually -- we can understand it as having a

4

utilitarian function that is different from simply

5

conveying information and it is different from simply

6

making something appear a certain way.

7

MR. BURSCH:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9
10

Yeah.
In other words, the

utilitarian function that camouflage has is to hide you
in the woods.

11

MR. BURSCH:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

would not be excluded by these things.

14

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.
And so -- so that function

Right, but the utilitarian

15

function of the fabric only works -- of the design only

16

works in conjunction with the useful article, and the

17

same is true here.

20

look at that, you don't immediately see that there is a

21

22

camouflaged.

23

When you talk about camouflage, it's
We've got that

Well, in the same way with these

24

cheerleader-uniform designs, it creates the optical

25

illusion that they are taller, that they're slimmer,

that they're -- they're curvier.

And so -- so then you lose the utility.

You

2

know, they would say under their test that -- that here,

3

because I can conceptualize this uniform separate from

4

the fabric, that that's enough.

5

because if that design is doing work on the fabric in

6

the place where it was designed to be, then utilitarian

7

function is lost when you remove it.

8

what Section 101 requires, right?

9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:
MR. BURSCH:

And that's exactly

True, true.

So you have to look not only at

11

the design; you have to look at the article as well.

12

And if the article does less work when that thing is

13

gone, it's not separable.

It's protectable.

If there are no further questions, I'll

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20
21

MR. JAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

22

Congress directed the copyright office and

23

the courts to protect applied art as well as fine art.

24

Applied art is art applied to a useful article.

25

where that directive comes into the statute is in

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

Section 101 and in the -- in its definition of pictorial

2

graphic and sculptural works, and in the substantive

3

provisions that implement that.

4

Now, there are two key directives there,

5

which the Copyright Office has faithfully implemented

6

over many years in thousands upon thousands of

7

registration decisions for applied art, and two key

8

principles which the Petitioner rejects.

9

Number one is that this is a hypothetical

10

inquiry capable of existing independently of, can be

11

identified.

12

And the second is that courts and the

13

Copyright Office are not required to get into the

14

question of how effective the visual or artistic

15

expression of the copyrighted work is.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

the camouflage case?

18

MR. JAY:

What do you do about

We think that camouflage -- the

19

idea of camouflage certainly can't be copyrighted

under --

No, no, no.

This is

a special design that things are curved one way or

another that nobody else had thought of.

I do think that an

can it be reproduced on a military uniform?

MR. JAY:

think -- I think it could -- that copyright could extend

12

to that.

that, I think exactly as Justice Kagan said to my

friend, for reasons having to do with the utility of the

camouflage design itself.

that the graphic designs, the striped chevrons and color

blocks, they are separable from the useful article on

MR. JAY:

From the 1950s.

Well, you could -- you could have

8

9

Appendix, you'll see in Star's own catalogue examples of

10

uniforms that have neither stripes nor chevrons nor

11

color blocks.

12

identifying a cheerleader as a cheerleader, even if

13

identifying were a function that's cognizable under the

14

statute, which it is not; ultimately, the design can be

15

taken and put on other articles.

16

as I said before, an iPhone cover or on the warm-up

17

jackets, warm-ups and jackets that are in -- reproduced

18

in a joint --

19

Those simply aren't essential to

It could be, you know,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your friend on the

20

other side concedes that those could be copyrighted.

If

21

you take the design of a particular cheerleading uniform

22

and put it on the lunchbox or the computer cover, yes,

23

those can be copyrighted.

24

that makes the dress a cheerleading uniform, you can't

25

separate -- you can't copyright the design applied to

But because it is the design

Alderson Reporting Company

that functional article.

2

MR. JAY:

Well, let me resist the premise,

3

of course, then, that this -- this particular design or

these five particular designs and striped chevrons and

5

color blocks are what make a cheerleading uniform a

cheerleading uniform.

right to embody it on use --

That is not the statute that Congress

I think you're

avoiding the question.

Yes, you can have a copyright in

20

the pattern; and, yes, you can attach it to a useful

21

article like a lunchbox that's going to have a design.

22

But the question is when the design is what makes that

23

useful article what it is -- the design on a lunchbox

24

doesn't make the lunchbox a lunchbox.

25

It's still a

But the design on a cheerleading uniform is

Alderson Reporting Company

31

what makes it a cheerleading uniform, as opposed to a

2

plain dress.

3

MR. JAY:

Well, I guess I just have to

4

resist the premise that these particular designs are

5

what make a cheerleading uniform a cheerleading uniform.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if you -- I

7

understand you are resisting the premise as applied to

8

your case.

9

it is the design that makes the article what it is in

10
11

But is that right as a general test, that if

its utilitarian aspect, that that cannot be copyrighted?
MR. JAY:

I think that's exactly the kind of

12

utility that Congress did not write into the statute.

13

That -- that is not the kind of utilitarian function

14

that Congress contemplated.

15

evidence of that is both in the legislative history,

16

meaning the House report, and also in the register's

17

testimony about what the Copyright Office had been doing

18

for decades explaining to Congress in the course of

19

adopting doing the '76 Act, both the register and the

20

House reports say that virtually all two-dimensional

21

designs applied to useful articles are going to remain

22

copyrightable.

23

think that, you know, again you -- even if the House

that the cheerleading uniforms do not serve a

serve the utilitarian purpose -- that the purposes my

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Mr. Jay, see -Now, wait.

I have a

4

conceptual question.

5

answer to the practical question because I fear that any

6

good designer or lawyer could go and take any dress or

7

suit, just about, and produce a picture that looks very

8

much like that and then sue the companies that use the

9

same dress or style.

10
11

I'm not yet satisfied with your

That's my practical, but this is

the conceptual.
Since we can take -- since we can take

12

anything -- anything -- to a two-dimensional picture and

13

put it on the wall like Marcel Duchamp, if I decide in

14

your favor, am I not allowing copyright for virtually,

15

assuming other things satisfied, every design of a

16

useful article, the very thing that Congress said they

17

did not want?

18

MR. JAY:

No, absolutely not, because the

19

ability to take the shovel and hang it on the wall does

20

not make the shovel a sculpture because the things that

21

make the "utilitarian aspect" --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not talking about the

23

shovel at the moment.

I am talking about an artist's

24

ability to take a piece of clothing, which is a

25

utilitarian object, and do a two-dimensional picture of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

the piece of clothing, which it has some things on it,

2

some chevrons, or nothing.

3

Now on your theory, does that not become copyrightable?

4

MR. JAY:

It just looks like a dress.

Only in the surface design, not

5

the folds, not the pleats, not the shape, not the cut.

6

And my friend agreed with me --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Jay, can I --

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

As to the -- as to the

9

surface design, I have a similar question.

But suppose

10

I go to a Museum of Modern Art and I look at a great

11

many famous abstract paintings.

12

say that all of those could be copyrighted, could they

13

not?

14
15
16
17

MR. JAY:

I assume that you would

You know, if they are original and

meet the other requisites, one assumes so, yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:

And so the design on any

fabric, potentially, could be copyrighted, could it not?

18

MR. JAY:

The surface --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. JAY:

If it began as a painting?

The owner of the copyright in that

21

painting has the right to reproduce it on fabric, on

22

other textiles, you know, or you know, on a -- on a

23

tapestry, on a rug or on wallpaper.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Absolutely.

And isn't it -- just

starting from the premise that Justice Alito suggested,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

the -- fabric designs are copyrightable; is that

2

correct?

3
4

MR. JAY:

That's what -- that's what I was

trying to say to Justice Breyer --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

MR. JAY:

7

10

My friend agreed that the fabric

design is copyrightable.

8
9

Everybody agrees with that.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So it seems to me that the

question, right, in this case, is are you going to treat
this kind of design just as you would a fabric design?

11

MR. JAY:

That's right.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And as I understand

13

Mr. Bursch's point, what Mr. Bursch is saying is, no,

14

you shouldn't, because this kind of design has -- it --

15

it follows the figure of a human body, essentially.

16

that's the difference between just a design of like

17

stripes and zigzags and chevrons sort of abstractly, and

18

then one that's put on something that looks like a

19

particular piece of apparel that's meant to fit onto a

20

human body in a particular way.

21

And

And that seems to me to be the -- the

22

distinction he's making, and I want you to tell me why

23

that distinction, in your view, doesn't make a

24

difference.

25

MR. JAY:

It doesn't make a difference

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

because what he -- he has identified a number of

2

different supposed "utilitarian aspects," and some of

3

which, I think, actually go to the fabric of the dress

4

and were not -- or the uniform.

5

to that.

We're not laying claim

6

What he's talking about are the -- are the

7

visual ones, the ones that make the cheerleader look a

8

particular way.

9

copyright those as it applies to a cheerleader uniform

And he's saying that you can't

10

because they're especially useful there.

11

know, that's where they are most effective in conveying

12

this image.

13

Like, you

We -- that is not what the definition of

14

utilitarian -- the meaning of "utilitarian aspects"

15

encompasses because any work of visual art conveys a --

16

you know, a visual message or an aesthetic impact.

17

to have the ones that are most effective be least

18

copyrightable we think doesn't work.

19

And I think that --

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

What is the difference

21

between that utilitarian argument and the utilitarian

22

argument as applied to camouflage?

23

MR. JAY:

The utilitarian argument as

24

applied to camouflage is that it's -- I mean, as I said

25

to the Chief Justice, we do think that if you see

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

camouflage as portraying the appearance of a -- you

2

know, of a particular thing, you know, or -- or sending

3

a message that you belong in -- in a particular group,

4

that would not be copyright-eligible -- sorry -- that --

5

that would not be a "utilitarian aspect."

6

If camouflage is not copyright-eligible,

7

it's because it performs something that's different from

8

making you look good in a -- in an anesthetic way.

9

because it conceals.

10
11
12

You know, ultimately, we think the

best answer is that -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But why -- why should that

make a difference?

13

MR. JAY:

14

the key word in the definition.

15

using one of the fine arts examples, you know, might

16

help to illustrate this point.

17

It's

I mean, the word "utilitarian" is
And I -- I think maybe

If you look in the amicus brief of

18

Professors Buccafusco and Fromer, they have in their

19

illustration number one is the fresco painted on the

20

dome of a church.

21

copyright-eligible because it uses techniques to make

22

the dome look bigger.

And they say that's not

23

And now you certainly can't get a copyright

24

in the idea of Trompe-l'oeil art, but you certainly get

25

a copyright in a work of fine art that decorates a room

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

or a rug or a useful -- you know, a useful article, and

2

that makes the room look better or makes the person who

3

wears it look better.

4

that it makes -- you know, it serves to make that

5

particular church look bigger, that is not a reason to

6

withhold a copyright protection.

7

And the fact that it's effective,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your -- the argument

8

is not that it makes the room or whatever look better.

9

The argument here is the design makes this look like a

10

cheerleader uniform, which is different and distinctive

11

function in -- than a normal dress.

12

MR. JAY:

Well --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not simply to

14

cover the body.

15

It shows that you're a member of the cheerleading squad

16

and --

17

It's to convey a particular message.

MR. JAY:

Well -- well, if that were true,

18

Mr. Chief Justice, they'd have a decent argument under

19

the merger doctrine if there were -- if there were only

20

a few ways of expressing that you are a cheerleader and

21

that you are wearing a cheerleader uniform.

22

get a copyright in an idea.

23

You can't

That's 102(b).

The merger doctrine, not this utilitarian

24

separability analysis that we've been talking about, the

25

merger doctrine is the primary way in which courts and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

the Copyright Office can, you know, prevent the owner of

2

a copyright from locking up the ways of expressing a

3

particular idea.

4

only a couple ways of looking like a cheerleader, that

5

would be the way to -- to get at that.

6

So that if, on the facts, there were

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under your -- under your

7

argument, and as you best understand your colleagues'

8

argument, to what extent are there findings of fact

9

involved here?

10

this?

11
12

I mean, are we the ones that decide

You wanted to introduce expert testimony.
What was the expert testimony you wanted to introduce?

MR. JAY:

The other side wanted to introduce

16

is a pure legal question.

17

Petitioner told this

We agree that, under the correct analysis,

18

it is a pure legal question.

19

vice of the other side's view, that they are asserting,

20

you know, essentially, as a matter of law that certain

21

things are necessary to be a cheerleader; that certain

22

things are -- influenced by function or form.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

that.

25

that somebody's a cheerleader.

We think that's a real

Well, you just said

You said there are a lot of other ways to show
And, you know, maybe I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

started to try to think of them.

2

not just that they all look alike, it's -- so maybe

3

that's one area which you have testimony, that 95

4

percent of the cheerleading squads look like this.

5

maybe there aren't other ways.

6

MR. JAY:

And, you know, it's

So

Well, ultimately, the question is

7

-- the question is the hypothetical question whether

8

this design can -- can be identified separately from the

9

articles on which it appears and whether it has -- it

10

has an existence separate from those articles.

11

And I think --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

And when you say "this

design" -- I'm sorry, Mr. Jay.

14

MR. JAY:

No, Your Honor --

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

When you say "this design,"

16

just to make sure I understand what you're claiming

17

copyright in, so if I'm looking at page 4 and there's

18

this design with a blue stripe and a white stripe and a

19

red stripe and a white stripe and a blue stripe, could

20

somebody else come along and just add another red stripe

21

to that?

22

violated our copyright?

23
24
25

And would that -- would you then say you

MR. JAY:

Our copyright is in the

arrangement of the design elements.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

The particular arrangement.

Alderson Reporting Company

45
1

So if somebody just added a different, another stripe.

2

MR. JAY:

Well, adding another stripe is --

3

I -- I hesitate to agree with because usually

4

reproducing a copyrighted work and then adding some

5

other stuff around it is not enough to avoid

6

infringement.

7

reordered the elements, I think they'd have a good

8

argument that it's not infringing.

camouflage is generally eligible, at least for a very

So as applied to a military

manufacturer of a uniform from actually manufacturing a

15

uniform that would perform a concealment function, and

16

if concealment were, as Justice Kagan was positing,

But what I think the dispute in this case is really

3

boiling down to is a question of what the utilitarian

4

aspects of the "useful article" are.

5

are two the Petitioner's identifying:

6

the information that someone is a cheerleader,

7

identifying someone as a cheerleader; and the other is

8

affecting the viewer's perception of the wearer's

MR. FEIGIN:

What about Lemley's --

What we're here about -What about Lemley's test on

page 17 of his brief?

As I -- as I read it, as I read

it and I thought -- and I'm sure you've read it -- and

6

it seemed to me that it does say that a two-dimensional

7

picture of a three-dimensional piece of clothing is not

8

entitled to copyright because it is not a design of

anything but a utilitarian object, the clothes, whether

10

they are beautiful clothes, ugly clothes, cheerleader,

12

MR. FEIGIN:

we disagree that you can't take the aesthetic aspects of

3

points.

4

Let me just make a couple of

One is about the act and what it's doing

5

overall.

The act overall is drawing a distinction

6

between the kinds of aesthetic communicative expressive

7

functions that are traditionally protected by copyright

8

and the kinds of mechanical, pragmatic, utilitarian

9

functions that are exclusively the domain of a "useful

10

article."

And the kinds of functions that Mr. Bursch is

11

talking about here are fundamentally expressive

12

functions.

13

First of all, conveying the information that

14

someone is a cheerleader.

15

particular piece of clothing intended to convey that

16

they're a member of a particular group or that they hold

17

a particular belief, that is the kind of expressive

18

function that copyright traditionally protects.

19

When someone is wearing a

And, indeed, there is an express exception

20

in the definition of a "useful article" for conveying

21

information.

22

putting a sports team logo on a T-shirt to identify

23

someone as a Washington Capitals fan, for instance.

24
25

And I think this is indistinguishable from

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what do you do in

Mr. Bursch's examples of military uniforms or police

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

officer uniforms, something like that?

2

MR. FEIGIN:

So, Your Honor, those also are

3

conveying information.

Now, if someone were trying to

4

assert a copyright in the design of a policeman uniform

5

in such a way that it turned out there were, say, only a

6

limited number of ways to identify someone as a

7

policeman and a copyright were being asserted to prevent

8

identification of someone as a policeman, then the

9

defenses that we discuss at pages 39 to 40 of our brief,

10

the "merger" doctrine, the "scènes à faire" doctrine,

11

would apply to prevent what would effectively be

12

monopolization of that idea.

13

So if that were really happening in this

14

case -- and there are some reasons to think that's not

15

actually happening in the cheerleading realm, and we

16

discuss those in our brief -- if that were happening,

17

those defenses would apply.

What about the Galiano

case?

22

don't agree with the result in the Galiano case.

extent there was some sort of unique, two-dimensional

24

elements that some casino wanted to put on its uniforms

25

to identify its employees, that artwork would be

Alderson Reporting Company

To the

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

copyrightable and -- just like the cheerleading uniforms

2

in this case.

3

I also want to address the argument --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, before you get away

5

from that, one thing very quick, because maybe I really

6

agree with you.

7

MR. FEIGIN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

your brief at figure 8.

I hope so.
I had looked at page 22 of

And what I had seen there when

10

I took the arms away was a picture of a thing that was a

11

picture of the cut and style and not just a picture of

12

chevrons.

13

would agree and I would agree that it's not -- everybody

14

would agree, I guess, it's not copyrightable.

15

And so -- but if that's what it is, then you

MR. FEIGIN:

The point of figure 7 and 8 in

16

our brief, Your Honor, is that everything you see in

17

figure 7 that's also in figure 8 is not copyrightable.

18

That's the cut and shape of the dress.

19

and the coloration, the lines and the design in this

20

particular arrangement.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's the stripes

So what happens if when you

22

look at the picture that they submit to the Copyright

23

Office and try to figure out if it's separable what you

24

see is a picture of a dress that goes around a woman

25

which does look like, you know, shape and cut and so

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

forth?

2

MR. FEIGIN:

So they have generally checked

3

a box, as they did here, that says two-dimensional

4

artwork, and the Copyright Office understands all

5

they're trying to protect is the surface imagery of the

6

garment, and that, they'll register.

7

I do want to address this idea that making

8

the viewer look different is somehow the kind of

9

non-expressive function that is associated with the

10

"useful article" -- with a "useful article."

11

think that approach would be contrary to congressional

12

intent and completely inadministrable.

13

And I

If you look at page 55 of the House report,

14

you'll see that Congress believed that two-dimensional

15

designs on fabric or on wallpaper would be separable and

16

thus copyrightable.

17

approach petitioner is urging.

18

But that wouldn't be true under the

Under that approach, you'd have to look at a

19

particular two-dimensional design on wallpaper and try

20

to assess whether and to what degree it might make the

21

room look bigger or brighter or smaller or darker.

22

not aware of any scientific reliable or consistent way

23

--

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm

Well, that seems a problem.

But on the other hand, it seems a little bit strange

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

that, you know, take a garment designer who wants to do

2

a design that is slimming.

3

kinds of structural things you can do that are slimming,

4

and those would not be copyrightable.

5

MR. FEIGIN:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And if -- there are all

Correct.
Then you're saying that

7

the -- that the placement of stripes or color, that is

8

copyrightable, even though the garment designer is

9

really trying to do the same thing through color and

10

through graphic design as he was doing through the shape

11

of the article.

12

MR. FEIGIN:

So, Your Honor, I definitely

13

think there is a spectrum here, but let me try to

14

explain why I think this is on the expressive side of

15

the line, not the non-expressive side of the line.

16

If I were to wear a shirt that said "Please

17

focus on my very nicely toned arms.

18

hard on them," I think we'd all understand the message

19

conveyed by that shirt to be expressive and separable

20

from the non-expressive functions that the shirt

21

performs covering my body.

22

I've worked very

Now, what -- the kinds of things that we're

23

talking about here are essentially sending that same

24

message, albeit in a nonverbal, more subconscious way,

25

but they're still fundamentally expressive because

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

54
1

they're about how the wearer is trying to portray

2

themselves and their appearance to the world, and that's

3

all that's being copyrighted.

4

within the domain of copyright.

5

a particular functionality.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's traditionally
It is not copyrighting

Is the domain of copyright

7

to copyright the way people present themselves to the

8

world?

9

MR. FEIGIN:

The way that someone

10

expresses -- the way that someone expresses an idea to

11

the world -- in this case, the idea would be how they

12

look -- is something that is very akin to traditional

13

expression that's protected by copyright.

14

Again, here we're just talking about

15

two-dimensional artwork.

16

petitioner's view, the Copyright Office, when it looks

17

at a particular two-dimensional design, would have to

18

figure out what effect it would have in all sorts of

19

contexts on various "useful articles," which would

20

really --

21

If we were -- if we adopted

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The whole point of

22

the case is we're not just talking about two-dimensional

23

artwork.

24

applied to a -- the fabric in a way that conveys a

25

utilitarian function.

We're talking about two-dimensional artwork

It's not just -- your friend

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

55
1

concedes that if you want to put a picture of this on a

2

lunchbox or whatever that you have a copyright in that.

3

It's only when you apply it to a garment -- because it

4

is what makes that garment a cheerleading outfit as

5

opposed to somebody else; it serves that utilitarian

6

function -- that you don't have a copyright.

7

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, I think our

8

fundamental disagreement is whether this is actually

9

performing utilitarian functions.

If I could just --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sure.

11

MR. FEIGIN:

12

And I think one -- I think one problem with

-- finish my response.

13

the approach you've just articulated is it really

14

divorces Section 101 and 113(a) because you could get a

15

copyright in the illustration, and then he would say

16

it's not copyrightable in certain applications, and that

17

doesn't make much sense.

18

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Bursch, six minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

24

I want to start with that final point that

25

the government makes, that if you had a statement that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

56
1

says look at my arms on your shirt that somehow that

2

would be conveying the same message.

3

what this is doing.

4

Like with camouflage, you're not saying, look, you can't

5

see me.

6

That -- that's not

No one is saying, look at my arms.

The camouflage is actually doing work when

7

it's put in connection with the garment that it was

8

designed for.

9

That's the point.

And on that point, Justice Kagan, I just

10

want to make clear about the functionality that we are

11

claiming here with respect to these designs.

12

just that the lines follow the figure of the human body.

13

It's that they actually make the human body appear to

14

look different than it would if they were not wearing

15

those designs.

16

It's not

It's just like camouflage.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the colors do.

I

17

mean, the colors are just colors.

18

saying is you can achieve the same thing with probably

19

most colors and stripes and whatever else is in these

20

designs.

21
22

MR. BURSCH:
copyright in the colors.

You can -- what he is

Well, they are not claiming
They -- they can't --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, they are not.

24

MR. BURSCH:

25

And I would say even as to color, this Court

-- the arrangement.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

in the Qualitex case, that was a trademark case, you

2

said that black, the color black has the ability to make

3

a motor look smaller than it actually is.

4

function that makes it ineligible for trademark

5

protection, and, really, that's the same thing that we

6

are talking about here.

7

like camouflage --

8
9
10

That you can use graphic design

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

there is no copyright on those things.
MR. BURSCH:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Oh, no.

MR. BURSCH:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

We are saying -On those pictorial

representations --

14

16

Before we are going much

further, you're now saying that any -- you're saying

11

13

It has a

Yes.
-- because they can

always be applied in a way that has a function.
MR. BURSCH:

That -- that's not correct,

18

because if you took the sports logo that the government

19

mentioned, that's a perfect example of something that

20

doesn't require the garment for its functionality,

21

because, just like we were discussing earlier, you could

22

take the logo, and you could put it on your hat or your

23

socks or your lunch pail or on your -- your mitten that

24

you hold up when the folks hit the home run, right,

25

because it doesn't rely at all for the article on which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

58
1

it's appeared for its functionality.

2

But here, these designs rely entirely --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

look fatter --

5

MR. BURSCH:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. BURSCH:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10
11

Certain kinds make you

Right.

Exactly.
You believe that --

And if -So you're saying none --

even if you find a color rainbow of some weird elk that
could never be copyrighted, because -MR. BURSCH:

They -- they could have the

12

copyright in the two-dimensional design, but if there

13

was an application where it would create functionality

14

when paired with a garment, then, yes, their copyright

15

would not extend to prevent --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17
18
19

How about the gorilla, a

gorilla's hand around your -- one of the pictures in -MR. BURSCH:

Right.

That -- that's a much

closer case than this one.

20

For starters, if we're walking through the

21

analysis, first you look at the identified separately,

22

and, here, when you look at the arrangements of the

23

stripes and the color blocks and the chevrons, you --

24

you see the cheerleader uniforms.

25

And this is Justice Breyer's point about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

page 17 of the Lemley brief, right, that the aesthetic

2

elements exist only as part of a cheerleader uniform.

3

There's nothing to extract.

4

different than the gorilla case.

5

That's why this case is

So then what you have to ask is if the --

6

the -- the T-shirt in that case was less functional

7

without the design, and I think that's a -- a close

8

call.

9

But -- but this case is like the camouflage

10

because it's -- it's doing the work of changing the way

11

the body is perceived just the way camouflage changes

12

the way the body is perceived, and just like military

13

uniforms, having an identifying function which is

14

extremely important.

15

So I -- I bring this all back to what the

16

Chief Justice said, isn't it the test, if it's the

17

design that makes the article what it is, then you can't

18

copyright it.

19

exactly right.

20

And I would say that that's almost

They can copyright the design and prevent

21

reproduction of the two-dimensional design on the

22

notebook or the lunchbox, but if it's the design that

23

makes the article what it is, you can't manufacture --

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do we decide that

it's -- how do we decide that it's the design that makes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

60
1

it what it is, as opposed to the cut of the garment, the

2

shape, the pleats or whatever, the tightness of the top?

3

What -- why should we say that -- that this

4

two-dimensional design, which could be put on many

5

things, is what makes this article utilitarian?

6

But what do you do about the shape?

7

MR. BURSCH:

8

the shape.

9

Well, here it's more than just

If we go back and look at page -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we -- everybody

10

agrees that the shape, the cut of the dress, that the

11

garment itself is not copyrightable, right?

12

MR. BURSCH:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

Correct.

So we are talking about

the -- the design.

15

MR. BURSCH:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

Everyone agrees.

Yes.
So why -- why is this

close to a fabric design?

18

MR. BURSCH:

Because, again, the fabric

19

designs work anywhere, anyplace, no matter how you move

20

them.

21

waist narrowing Vs, which are not the shape of the dress

22

but they -- they make the illusion that the shape of the

23

dress is cutting in to make you slimmer, those only work

24

in that particular place on this article.

25

If we are looking at page 5 and you've got the

If you put those on the lunchbox, they don't

Alderson Reporting Company

1

2

3

They don't even make the

The designs, the shape of the designs work

4

just like the shape of the garment itself, and -- and

5

that's why this is different than that flowered print

6

that we were talking about in the -- the Folio case.

7

You know, in -- in conclusion, I want to go

8

back to what Justice Breyer and what Justice Sotomayor

9

said:

That if you recognize their -- their

10

two-dimensional copyright extends to prohibit the

11

manufacture of actual three-dimensional cheerleader

12

uniforms, then -- then you're giving them 100-year of

13

copyright monopoly, and that school can't go anywhere

14

else.

15

in mind that --

And that's really ironic because you have to keep

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, can't the school just

17

go to somebody who puts the zigzag where the chevron

18

was, or the chevron where the zigzag was, or makes it a

19

couple of different colors or adds another stripe?

20
21

I mean, there's this -- my clerk found -I'm sorry.

Just add that --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

MR. BURSCH:

25

No, you can --

I'm done with my question.

Yeah, as my -- as my friend on

the other side said, it -- it would still be a copyright

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

62
1

problem because they would claim that it was too close

2

to the original.

3

And you can see from the last two pictures

4

that we have in our reply brief, that there are only

5

certain places that these stripes and chevrons and color

6

blocks can go, otherwise it doesn't look like a

7

cheerleader uniform anymore.

8

9

making taller effect, and all the other things that

10
11

Certainly doesn't have the slimming effect, the

So we respectfully request that you not

grant a 100-year copyright monopoly in design.
