ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. RASHKIND

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. RASHKIND:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

A single notice of appeal perfects the

11

criminal -- the appeal of a criminal judgment and

12

sentence even if a part of that sentence is deferred.

13

It doesn't matter whether the appeal is first noticed at

14

the completion, after restitution is decided, or if the

15

appeal is noticed at the outset, after the initial

16

sentencing hearing.

17

of appeal perfects appeal of all issues that arise

18

within that judgment and sentence when it is fully

19

completed.

20

In either event, that single notice

We know this in part because of the Court's

21

decision in Dolan.

In Dolan the Court struggled with

22

the mechanics.

23

Mandatory Victims Restitution Act?

24

a district court to do?

25

those mechanics, the Court said that essentially the

How was the Court going to evaluate the

second document fills in an amount-related blank in the

2

original judgment that made clear that restitution was

applicable.

It is clear that what happens second, the

5

restitution part, is nothing more than a completion of

the original judgment and sentence.

7

judgment.

8

completion, a fill-in-the-blanks as the Court has

9

phrased it.

10

It is not a new sentence.

It is not a new
It is simply a

We know not only from Dolan that this should

11

be the case, but we know it also by looking at the

12

criminal appellate rules as they relate to criminal

13

cases.

14

4(b), each section leads to a single conclusion.

15

one notice of appeal is required.

16

If we go down one by one each of the sections of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Only

What about 3(c), which

17

requires the notice of appeal to designate the judgment

18

order or part thereof being appealed?

19

appeal can't designate an order that has not yet been

20

made.

21

MR. RASHKIND:

So a notice of

That's correct, yet it's not

22

entirely correct.

3(c) says designate the judgment

23

under review, which we've done here.

24

judgment, the June 24 judgment, and that is the one and

25

only that's under review.

It was the initial

At the time that it was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

entered, it was interim or incomplete, provisional,

2

something that the Court has seen previously in cases

3

like Corey and Firstier Mortgage, judgments that were

4

not completely filled out by the time the notice of

5

appeal was filed.

6

judgment as it was eventually completed by the later

7

restitution proceeding.

8

But we are only appealing the June 24

We argue -- and I think the rules and Dolan

9

make clear, that there is but one notice of appeal --

10

but one judgment in these cases and it only has to be

11

noticed the one time.

12

If we look at the balance of --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do you tell the

14

difference between one judgment and an amended judgment?

15

Are you suggesting you don't have to appeal from an

16

amended judgment?

17

MR. RASHKIND:

That's correct.

In the case

18

of the deferred restitution, the Court made clear that

19

there was not an additional judgment occurring, an

20

amended judgment or an additional judgment.

21

Again, to use the Court's words, the second

22

document, if you will, is filling in the blanks of a

23

judgment that was previously entered, leaving clear that

24

those blanks were yet to be filled in.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I --

So what happens if your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

initial appeal ends before the restitution order is

2

actually entered?

3

that second, that restitution order?

4

MR. RASHKIND:

Have you lost your right to appeal

No, for the following reason,

5

Your Honor.

6

two times to appeal, and this has been recognized by the

7

courts below as well.

8
9

As we indicated at the outset, there are

There are two times that the defendant may
appeal.

He may either appeal at the outset right after

10

sentencing -- actually the more logical time to do it

11

would be at the conclusion of the case.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Rashkind --

5

MR. RASHKIND:

Well -- go ahead.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Rashkind, as I hear you

7

now, you're saying something different from what I

8

understood your brief to be saying, so maybe I just -- I

9

understood your brief to be principally arguing that

10

this was a consequence of Rule 4(b)(2), and so far, I

11

haven't heard you mention Rule 4(b)(2).

12

you seem to be saying is that regardless of Rule

13

4(b)(2), we should treat the initial judgment and the

14

later judgment as though they are the same judgment.

15

And 4(b)(2) doesn't have to exist for that argument to

16

be correct.

17

but it's a different argument than the argument I

18

understood you to be making in your brief.

Instead, what

I'm not saying that argument is correct,

19

So which are you making?

20

MR. RASHKIND:

I'm really making both.

I'm

21

not saying 4(b)(2) is not part of this equation.

22

began to say that earlier, when I started to go down the

23

parts of rule 4(b) that I think clearly show we're

24

dealing with a single judgment here.

25

very helpful to us, because it incorporates the Court's

Alderson Reporting Company

I

4(b)(2) is very,

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

decision in Lemke from 1953 in which the Court really

2

looked at the question of what does a premature notice

3

of appeal really mean, if anything, and how much

4

significance does it have, if any.

5

A theme that the Court -- that case Lemke

6

became Rule 4(b)(2), and the Court revisited this in

7

Firstier Mortgage when it said there is a difference

8

between something that's tardy and something that's

9

early, and that the vice of one is not the same as the

10

other.

11

talking about the failure to allow a judgment to become

12

final as it should, once the time expires for appeal.

13

And that's why the court is very, very concerned with

14

something that's tardy.

15

and originally in Lemke, there is a recognition if you

16

file something too early, that's just a technical

17

violation.

18

In the case of something that's tardy, we are

But as in Firstier Mortgage,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In your view, if you have

19

ordered an entry of a conviction based on jury verdict,

20

fixing sentence, order of restitution, amount to be

21

determined within 60 days, can you wait 60 days to

22

appeal everything?

23

appeal within 14 days as to the sentence and the order

24

of conviction?

25

Or must you file the first notice of

MR. RASHKIND:

No, I think you -- certainly,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

I believe that that was the natural progression; you

2

waited until the completion of the full judgment in

3

sentencing.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You -- you can now wait

5

until the order of restitution before you appeal the

6

sentence and the order of conviction?

7

MR. RASHKIND:

8
9

You -- you can -- you can

wait until restitution is completed to do that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you understand the

10

government to take that same position?

11

government, but...

12

MR. RASHKIND:

I can ask the

I'm not sure that we've --

13

we've actually briefed it in that very way.

14

that it -- before Dolan, most of the circuits actually

15

handled it that way.

16

this case arises, that was precisely the process.

17

Eleventh Circuit would hold the notice of appeal in

18

abeyance, would not let it go forward until the

19

restitution judgment was completed.

20

I think

In the Eleventh Circuit from where

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

No.

The

I asked, but

21

that's -- but that's when the notice of appeal was

22

timely filed.

23

file the notice of appeal until the restitution amount

24

is determined, say 60, 80 days later?

25

MR. RASHKIND:

I'm -- my question is, can you wait to

Yes.

And the answer to that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

is "yes."

2

juncture, the -- the judgment is completed, and that

3

window is always naturally open when a judgment is

4

completed.

5

And that's because certainly, at that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it --

6

conceptually, at least, that seems odd.

7

you're saying you can appeal what looks like a nonfinal

8

judgment.

9

It's got to be blank in it.
MR. RASHKIND:

10

In other words,

Right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you say you can

11

appeal that, even though it's not complete.

12

later on, you can appeal either the part that fills it

13

in, or the whole thing.

14

things are -- they're either final or not, and if they

15

are not, you can't appeal; and if they are, you can.

16

MR. RASHKIND:

And then

It seems to me that usually if

Although it may seem like

17

that conceptually, that's precisely what the Court

18

confronted in Corey, precisely what the court looked at

in Corey.

20

21

later down the road, up to -- up to six months down the

22

road, than the time the initial appeal would have been

allowed.

the time of appeal.

25

it was freighted with significant indicia of finality in

Because

the language of Corey for it to be obtained upfront.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not challenging

3

your reading of the case, but, I mean, that's a very

4

unusual type of approach when it comes to jurisdictional

5

rules, you know, final enough, you know, and then you

6

get other cases, are they final -- like this one:

7

this final enough or not.

8

be better served by a simple rule.

9

Is

It just seems to me we would

And even the rule -- well, if you can do two

10

different things, that means the court gave a notice of

11

appeal from the original judgment and they don't know --

12

they don't necessarily know if there's going to be

13

anything more, right?

14

insignificant enough that you don't feel it's worth

15

adding that to the appeal issues, any number of things.

16

So I don't see how they know should we hold onto this or

17

not hold onto it.

18

The restitution may be

MR. RASHKIND:

Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the

19

court of appeals never knows what the parties will be

20

arguing in their briefs until they are filed.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

I know they

22

can't.

Here, the question is whether you're going to

23

add anything at all.

24

restitution amount hasn't been entered, you can't

25

challenge the amount.

I mean, obviously, if the

But they don't know in the court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

of appeals:

2

appeal?

3

then you hold it in abeyance, and who knows for how

4

long, because it doesn't actually have to be within the

5

90 days.

6

Well, is he going to file another notice of

I guess we have to hold this in abeyance.

And

It just seems to me a very confusing system.
MR. RASHKIND:

As a practical matter, it has

7

not been confusing at all to the courts of appeal, which

8

have been -- who have been struggling with this, both

9

before Dolan and after.

We have identified in our brief

10

17 post-Dolan appeals, and the government has identified

11

another 15 post-Dolan appeals.

12

those cases, some of which took five and a half years

13

for the restitution to be resolved, three and a half

14

years, two and a half years, many cases go by where they

15

are resolved within the 90-day limit and -- and they are

16

not --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In every single one of

So does the Eleventh

18

Circuit routinely hold their appeals until the

19

restitution transcript is available?

20

MR. RASHKIND:

At one time, at one time, the

21

Eleventh Circuit actually took the position it had to

22

wait.

23

post-Dolan, post-Dolan, it has modified that position.

24
25

It had no jurisdiction to proceed.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But

But it waited here.

did it wait here?

Alderson Reporting Company

Why

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

MR. RASHKIND:

Because it does wait.

And

2

that's the tradition in the Eleventh Circuit.

They look

3

at the judgment -- they look at the judgement.

They --

4

the court and the parties all know that there's a

5

restitution matter outstanding, and it's held in

6

abeyance.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I just asked

8

whether they did it routinely, and you said not

9

post-Dolan.

10

So what do they do now?

11

MR. RASHKIND:

They do it, but I was saying

12

before, they did it because to them, it was a

13

jurisdictional issue.

14

but, yes, they still awaited.

15

It's not jurisdictional anymore,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But they still did.

16

they don't know whether you're going to challenge it

17

until the brief comes in?

18

MR. RASHKIND:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

That's correct.

MR. RASHKIND:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

But they're holding it

anyway.

21

23

So

That's correct, Your Honor.
Do they give up holding

it if you ask them to give it up?
MR. RASHKIND:

It -- it doesn't require a

true holding, because if we count the days it takes an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

appeal to go forward, there's 14 days to file a notice

2

of appeal, 14 more to order the transcript, 30 more for

3

the transcripts to come in and --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no, no.

I

5

understand we're in a mine run case.

6

those cases where restitution orders can take a year,

7

two years, three years?

8

do?

9

But how about in

What does the Eleventh Circuit

MR. RASHKIND:

The Eleventh Circuit, as

10

every other circuit, has awaited the outcome of the

11

restitution orders, the restitution answer, before it

12

goes forward to decide the appeal.

13

that were identified in the Petitioner's brief, and for

14

that matter, in the government's brief -- that's 32

15

cases.

16

cases -- a single panel of a single court of appeals

17

captured all of the issues that were to be heard in one

18

case.

19

that was still outstanding.

20

In all of the cases

There may be some duplicates there.

Post-Dolan

They were not concerned or troubled by anything

The reason for that really was predicted by

21

the Solicitor General's brief in Dolan itself.

It said

22

that in most cases we can expect that the court will

23

resolve it either at sentencing or within 90 days, and

24

that most appeals back then would take 12 months.

25

they take 10.6 months.

Now

That's plenty of time for the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

record to be raised, the new transcript of the

2

restitution hearing to be prepared, as it was in this

3

case, and for the parties to be able to fully brief the

4

issue.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm not so sure.

6

You're adding at least 90 days under your rule.

7

the meantime, if there is to be a new trial, we have

8

problems with witnesses being unavailable, the defendant

9

often in custody during this time.

10

And in

Three months is not

insubstantial.

11

MR. RASHKIND:

It is not insubstantial, but

12

it is -- it is three months, 7.6 months shorter than the

13

average appeal.

14

about these cases --

15
16
17

I don't believe that there's anything

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
long.

The average appeal is too

You're adding the 90 days.
MR. RASHKIND:

Well, I don't think -- Your

18

Honor, I would submit you're not adding 90 days.

In

19

many cases you may be adding -- in many cases you're

20

adding no time, because it's resolved either at

21

sentencing or -- not necessarily at the 90-day limit,

22

but sometime within that time.

23

I'm using an appropriate phrase -- dead time in an

24

appeal anyway.

25

-- it's when the transcripts are being ordered and the

terms.

18

You rely heavily

It says, "Notice of appeal filed after the

terms as the court in rules normally do, to the

the restitution amount fills in the blanks of the

original interim judgment.

7

The words "the judgment" in 4(b)(2)
It's speaking in

And it is not completed until

Our argument is that it applies for

8

precisely that reason because it is making reference to

9

the completed judgment.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but -- so

11

you're saying the rule doesn't apply, what I understood

12

to be the typical situation when it applies?

13

MR. RASHKIND:

It --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The court announces

15

a decision, you file the -- the notice of appeal, and

16

then they get around to entering it in a couple of days?

17

MR. RASHKIND:

It does apply.

It applies in

18

this setting.

As the judge did in this case, he

19

announces, because he must by law, and under the Dolan

20

formulation he has to, he says, restitution is mandatory

21

under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996.

22

can't ascertain the amount of damages currently, so I'm

23

going to postpone hearing on that.

24

postponed them for 60 days, ultimately decided just

25

under 90 days.

Alderson Reporting Company

In this case, he

I

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So he hasn't entered

a judgment with respect to the amount of restitution.
MR. RASHKIND:

That's correct.

The judgment

4

he has entered is as to the conviction, as to the other

5

aspects of sentence, which are final.

6

yet entered a judgment --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But he has not

But he also

8

hasn't -- he also hasn't announced a decision, and this

9

rule applies to a notice of appeal filed after the court

10

announces a decision.

11

MR. RASHKIND:

He has --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

With respect to the

13

subsequent order, that -- nothing about the amount has

14

been announced yet.

15

MR. RASHKIND:

He has announced it in the

16

same way, for example, that the announcement was made in

17

Corey, Behrens, and Firstier.

18

If I may explain:

When he says restitution

19

is mandatory, that's like the judge saying in a -- in a

20

bench statement in Firstier Mortgage, I'm going to grant

summary judgment.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Did I understand you,

Mr. Rashkind, to say earlier that you think you would

that 4(b)(2) deals with a different situation from the

MR. RASHKIND:

Yes, we do.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What's -- what's the

11

argument that's exclusive of 4(b)(2)?

12

MR. RASHKIND:

The argument boils down to

13

this:

In reading 4(b), there is not a single instance

14

under the Federal rules regarding criminal appeals in

15

which two notices of appeal are required in a single

16

appeal.

17

Every single time the rules drafted

18

encountered the possibility that two notices of appeal

19

might be required, they immediately rewrote the rules to

20

avoid that possibility.

21

of that is further down the rule.

sentence.

presumptuous if the Court says we see that these kinds

of problems going -- are going to arise and we'll

address them, and instead the rules drafters

pretermitted those decisions coming up with their own

19

answers to those questions.

Because in black and white in the

the rules don't cover this particular situation.

The rules are to

When, for example, one of the rules on the
civil side made it possible for a lawyer to make a

mistake by not filing a second notice of appeal,

something the Court recognized in its Griggs decision,

the rules drafters went right back and immediately

13

changed that rule and said in their commentary it was

14

designed to eliminate the trap for the unwary that the

there is a fair administration of justice without great

That's what the government says.

is, of course the court could have such a process.

But there are

other jurisdictions that actually require that.
MR. RASHKIND:

Well, there are -- there's

one that requires it.

There's one that's so unsure

24

about the answer, it has both accepted a single notice

of appeal and yet recommended the safer course is to

So the simplest thing with a rule, and it

doesn't hurt anybody, is what I think she was

suggesting:

18

You appeal, then you appeal.

20

Just follow what the government says there.

MR. RASHKIND:

although that may be intuitive --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. RASHKIND:

23

I think my answer to that is,

Yeah.
-- the rules don't require

lawyers to use their intuition.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. RASHKIND:

But the rule says -The rule says to follow the

rules.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're just being literal

in the rule.

says, pay so much.

The rule says in a criminal case, a

from the judgment, because there really are no appeals

10

of right by a defendant from an order.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

From the judgment.

So we

12

have a judgment which says -- judgment says, and it

13

leaves restitution open.

14

which is -- says how much the amount is.

15

so simple, and all the lawyers would understand it, and

16

the other seems more complicated.

Then we have another judgment
I mean, that's

17

Now, what's your response to that?

18

MR. RASHKIND:

My response is that that is

19

not the mechanical formulation that the Court provided

20

in Dolan.

It wrestled with that, the majority --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. RASHKIND:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Dolan didn't --- wrestled with -I know whether it answered

MR. RASHKIND:

It would be the first time in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17
18
19

MR. KEDEM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A criminal defendant may appeal an award of

20

restitution by filing a notice of appeal after the

21

amount is determined and entered against him in the form

22

of a criminal judgment.

23

to a notice of appeal that's filed after the

24

announcement of a sentence, but before entry of the

25

judgment memorializing the sentence.

Appellate Rule 4(b)(2) applies

Alderson Reporting Company

It does not apply.

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

Whereas here, the notice of appeal is filed long before

2

the Court even decides the appropriate sentence.

3

If I could begin --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask about the

5

criminal rule -- what number is it? -- 32, the provision

6

that says, "Appealing a sentence.

7

Court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal

8

the sentence."

9

MR. KEDEM:

10

After sentence, the

That's correct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And Defendant was so

11

advised after the sentence was issued.

12

such instruction, no such advice from the Court when the

13

restitution order was entered.

14

MR. KEDEM:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was no

That's correct.
So what is your position

16

on whether the Court must advise the defendant of any

17

right to appeal the restitution order?

18

MR. KEDEM:

Absolutely, it must.

And I

19

think when courts do that, as they absolutely should, it

20

will prevent cases like this from arising again in the

21

future.

22
23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it didn't happen in

this case.

24

MR. KEDEM:

That's correct.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the Court committed an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

error and it wasn't harmless.

2

MR. KEDEM:

Well, the way the Court has

3

addressed those sorts of errors -- and this was

4

discussed in the Peguero case, which is cited in a

5

footnote to our brief -- is to ask whether the litigant

6

was aware of their opportunity to appeal.

7

no suggestion here by a Petitioner that the litigant or

8

his attorney were unaware of the opportunity to appeal.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There's been

I think in Mr. Rashkind's

10

reply brief, he represents that there was no awareness

11

of the opportunity to appeal.

12

that gives you pause in a case like this is just because

13

usually, you only have to file one notice of appeal.

14

You do get worried about, you know, traps for the unwary

15

and a person who just won't understand that there's

16

another stage in this process and needs to file a notice

17

of appeal.

18

I mean, the only thing

As long as the Court is fulfilling its

19

obligation of saying, okay, now, you know, if you have

20

an objection to this, you need to file another notice of

21

appeal, well, that solves the problem.

22

doesn't say it, it doesn't solve the problem.

23

But if the Court

And apparently, that's what happened in this

24

case.

And Mr. Rashkind represents that his client

25

didn't know of his opportunity to, or his need to

appeal.

2

MR. KEDEM:

Well, with respect to this

3

Petitioner, I think that that's true.

4

makes unmistakably clear that a second notice of appeal

5

is required, I don't think this is the sort of thing

6

that's likely to arise in the future.

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So would we find this to

be a Rule 32 error?

9

MR. KEDEM:

10
11

Once the Court

Pardon?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why don't we just say

this was a Rule 32 error?

12

MR. KEDEM:

If you're talking about harmless

13

error, I think the types of errors that are cognizable

14

under -- I think it's Federal Criminal Rule 52, whether

15

you're talking about harmless errors or --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

I'm talking about a

Rule 32 error.

18

MR. KEDEM:

I see.

19

Rule 32 errors are dealt with in the manner

20

that was discussed in Peguero.

21

error of that sort here, then the proper remedy,

22

assuming one is available, would be to file a 2255

23

petition, assuming that those apply to restitution

24

orders.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so if there was an

Other than making a

Supreme Court case of this issue, given the practices in

2

the Eleventh Circuit where the Court automatically

3

appears to wait for the restitution transcript to come

5

going to talk about whether that's efficient or not.

6

They've chosen it to be efficient.

7

every other case, you've never raised an objection.

8
9
10

And virtually in

Why did you raise an objection here?
was the purpose of doing this?

What

Was it to make a test

case?

11

MR. KEDEM:

Not to my knowledge.

I think

12

the general principle that you can't appeal a decision

13

that hasn't yet been met is a pretty standard principle

14

in the law generally, not just in criminal cases.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. KEDEM:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's just --

And I can't --- such a hybrid

18

situation.

He's absolutely right.

19

appeals, it's one criminal appeal from a final judgment.

20

It doesn't appear as if you raised this timeliness

21

objection in the Eleventh Circuit as a matter of course.

22

MR. KEDEM:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

MR. KEDEM:

25

In most criminal

Well -So why in this case?

Well, in the Eleventh Circuit,

the Court had decided in a case called Muzio -- and that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

happened in -- I believe it was July of 2014, so before

2

the restitution hearing, but not much before it -- that

3

a criminal defendant in Petitioner's situation had two

4

options:

5

after the initial sentencing and then a second notice of

6

appeal after restitution was ordered, or they could wait

7

until the end and file one notice of appeal after

8

restitution.

9

2014.

They could either file a notice of appeal

10

And so that decision came down in July of

And we cannot verify or dispute the

11

representations that Petitioner has made that in

12

circuits, courts always wait.

13

But, Justice Kennedy, I think you identified

14

a very troubling implication of Petitioner's argument:

15

Namely, that it would prevent, in many cases, criminal

16

defendants from getting an immediate appeal from their

17

conviction in their terms of imprisonment.

18

Petitioner is correct about Appellate Rule 4(b)(2), it

19

means that the notice of appeal that he filed wouldn't

20

take effect; it wouldn't become effective until after

21

restitution was ordered, which means that the appellate

22

process really shouldn't begin until that point, which

23

is especially troubling for criminal defendants who

24

normally want to get their appeals up and going as soon

25

as possible.

Alderson Reporting Company

Because if

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Either in the rules

2

themselves or in the colloquy that takes place in the

3

criminal system, is the restitution part of the

4

sentence?

5
6

MR. KEDEM:

Restitution is certainly part of

the sentence.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that Rule 32(b) that

8

Justice Ginsburg quotes is applicable.

9

be -- there has to be advice of the right to appeal.

10

MR. KEDEM:

That's correct.

There has to

What many

11

district courts do is they have sentencing scripts which

12

they read at the end of a sentencing.

13

reason that they couldn't -- for instance, at the end of

14

the script that they used for a restitution hearing --

15

make sure that they advise a criminal defendant that

16

they have a right to separately appeal restitution.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And there's no

Then why -- why -- you --

18

I think you answered this, but I didn't grasp what the

19

answer was.

20

The -- the judge makes a mistake.

21

advise the defendant, if you want to appeal a

22

restitution order you have to file a notice of appeal.

23

Didn't say that.

24

the court made?

25

Doesn't

Isn't it harmful error, that slip that

MR. KEDEM:

So the Court addressed this in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

the Peguero case and talked about a situation in which a

2

notice of appeal was not filed, and the Court denied --

3

advised the defendant to file a notice of appeal and

4

there's a proper procedure that you have to go through

5

and the type of prejudice that you're talking about has

6

to depend in part on the State of knowledge of the

7

criminal defendant and his attorney.

8

But if I could, more directly --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, but if they don't

10

have knowledge, which is what we're assuming here

11

because that was alleged --

12

MR. KEDEM:

So I'm not sure it actually was

13

alleged.

I don't see any place in Petitioner's brief

14

where they represent that they didn't know they had a

15

right to appeal.

16

that they didn't know they had to file a second notice

17

of appeal, that was inconsistent with directly

18

applicable case law in the very same circuit.

And with respect to their argument

19

If I could --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But here, in fact, when

21

the restitution judgment was entered, the clerk of the

22

district court sent that order to the court of appeals.

23

So it was an amended judgment that was sent.

24
25

The -- the clerk of the court treated it as
though it were an amendment to the judgment, and it went

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

to the court of appeals.

2

height of formalism to say that there has to be a second

3

notice.

4

appeals that the judgment had been amended to include

5

restitution.

6

So it seems to me to be the

The clerk had already notified the court of

MR. KEDEM:

There's certainly some amount of

7

formalism, but let me explain why I don't think that

8

it's just formalism.

9

The general principle that you can't appeal

10

a decision that hasn't been made I think makes sense and

11

is not only consistent with the rules, but also with

12

the -- the way things normally work in litigation.

13

Let me give you three examples of cases in

14

which you actually would need a second notice of appeal

15

in a criminal case.

16

The first is a motion under Rule 35(a) of

17

the criminal rules to correct a sentence.

18

your notice of appeal before making a Rule 35(a) motion,

19

the courts of appeals generally require you to file a

20

second notice of appeal if what you want to challenge is

21

the resolution of the Rule 35(a) motion.

22

If you file

Similarly, Rule 35(b) allows a court to,

23

based on the substantial cooperation of a criminal

24

defendant, alter the sentence.

25

altered and the defendant wants to challenge that, then

If the sentence is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

the defendant has to file a second notice of appeal.

2

And the third example relates specifically

3

to restitution, because under the Mandatory Victims

4

Restitution Act you can actually end up with several

5

different restitution awards and therefore several

6

different judgments.

7

victims of criminal offenses have 60 days to bring up

8

new losses which they can raise to the court's attention

9

at any time.

And that's because criminal --

And if they do, the court has to award and

10

decide whether there's a new award of restitution.

It's

11

not clear how Petitioner's approach either to

12

Rule 4(b)(2) or his approach to judgments would handle

2

But if you're talking about completely new

3

losses, there's no reason why the original notice of

4

appeal should suffice to challenge a decision that

5

hasn't yet been made.

6

And keep in mind the nature of Petitioner's

7

challenge here, which is not to the fact of restitution,

8

which he acknowledges was mandatory under the statute.

9

He objected to the amount of restitution, and

10

specifically, to the sufficiency of the evidence that

11

the government put forward at the hearing to justify the

12

$4500 that was awarded in restitution.

13

simply no way that Petitioner at the time he filed his

14

notice of appeal could have had any idea about the basis

15

for that.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And there's

The issue here

strikes me as -- as somewhat similar to the issue that

18

arises in the civil context with respect to attorneys'

right that sometimes you file a second notice of appeal

but you're -- the rules waive fees?

That's correct.

24

very limited scenarios in which it would be waived, but

25

if you're talking about a scenario like this one, but a

There are only certain

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

criminal defendant who unlike Petitioner was not

2

indigent, I don't see any reason why the defendant

3

wouldn't be able to file an amended notice of appeal,

4

and many circuits don't require an additional fee.

5

And if the fee issue is something that the

6

Court is concerned about, that is the sort of thing that

7

it would be appropriate for the rules committee to

8

address.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You're recognizing that

10

he could file -- you could treat as an amended notice of

11

appeal, so it's one notice of appeal but it's been

12

amended.

13

MR. KEDEM:

I think you have to take a step

14

to amend the notice of appeal, because, Justice

15

Ginsburg, as you yourself pointed out, Appellate

16

Rule 3(c)(1)(b) requires the notice of appeal to

17

identify the judgment being appealed, and if you want to

18

see the notice of appeal that Petitioner filed, I would

19

direct you to page 42 of the joint appendix where he

20

states very specifically that he is seeking appeal,

21

quote, "From the final judgment and sentence entered in

22

this action on the 24th day of June, 2014."

23
24
25

So the -- he's seeking review of the
judgment that did not include restitution.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

Counsel, the Peguero

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

case, I -- do you read that as saying that if there is

2

prejudice to the defendant who wasn't advised of his

3

right to appeal, that defendant is entitled to

4

collateral relief?

5

MR. KEDEM:

I do read it that way.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I suppose the

7

collateral relief is what, reopening the -- the case so

8

that he can file a notice of appeal?

9

MR. KEDEM:

I think in that case, if you're

10

talking about a case that's cognizable on 2255, I think

11

the remedy could be re-entry of the judgment to give him

12

another opportunity to file his notice of appeal.

13

If I could briefly return just to the

14

Rule 4(b)(2) argument, because I think the text of that

15

rule explains why it is that it doesn't apply to this

16

case.

17

4(b)(2) refers to entry -- announcement of a

18

sentence followed by entry of the judgment, which I

19

think makes clear that you're talking about precisely

20

the same judgment that was just announced.

21

pretty familiar pattern in criminal cases where

22

sentences get announced and then they get entered into

23

the docket.

24

pair of parentheses, and usually that happens within a

25

few days of one another, if not a few hours.

And that's a

It's sort of like opening and closing a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

And so when you're talking about

2

Rule 4(b)(2), you're really talking about the notice of

3

appeal that would have been filed, for instance, after

4

the September 17 hearing at which a $4500 award of

5

restitution was announced but before it was entered into

6

the docket the next day.

7

we're dealing with here.

8
9

But that's obviously not what

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why couldn't you treat a

notice of appeal as adequate to cover modifications of

10

the judgment from which the appeal is taken?

11

that's what this is.

12

judgment.

13

MR. KEDEM:

Because

It's a modification of the

I think that would be

14

inconsistent with a few existing appellate rules of

15

procedure.

16

perhaps, to deal with that situation, but it would be a

17

fairly radical change in the way that notices of appeal

18

and jurisdiction normally work, because normally we

19

think of a notice of appeal as transferring to the court

20

of appeals' jurisdiction over all of the elements

21

contained in the judgment that was identified.

22

instead you would be transferring on a prospective basis

23

decisions that had yet to be made.

24

also, for the reasons that the Chief Justice identified,

25

be for a court of appeals very confusing.

And I -- I think you could change the rules,

Alderson Reporting Company

And

And I think it would

Because

remember that, in many cases, criminal defendants have a

2

strong incentive to get their appeal up and going as

soon as possible.

4

criminal defendant who's got a short prison term or you

5

want to be let out on bail pending appeal.

6

That's especially true if you're a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You said -- I'm not

7

going to get the phrase right -- jurisdiction over all

8

of the elements of the appeal, or something like that?

MR. KEDEM:

That's right.

Contained in the

judgment that you have appealed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

But I

12

thought the basic rule was -- and your friend has

13

emphasized this in his briefs -- that you get the case.

14

You don't get different elements that may have been

adjudicated or whatever.

16

the whole case goes up.

MR. KEDEM:

If you're filing the appeal,

I -- I don't think that

that proposition is the Corey decision.

actually supports the government.

But that

In Corey you were dealing with a statute in

within six months it could revisit that sentence and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

reduce the sentence based on new information.

And the question in Corey was whether the

challenge his conviction.

It wasn't a challenge to the

Instead, it was a challenge to the

And what this Court said is no, both the

10

original -- the original sentence to the statutory

11

maximum and the later sentence were sufficiently final

12

that they can be appealed, which is consistent with what

13

this Court has said in Dolan, and the government agrees,

14

which is that you can file a notice of appeal either

15

from your initial sentence or from your later sentence.

16

Or you can wait until the very end and file one notice

17

of appeal at the very end that will allow you to

challenge all elements of your sentence, including your

conviction.

anything about it.

Federal rule that I would point out, which is

appendix to the government's brief, which states, "An

appellant's failure to take any step, other than the

timely filing of a notice of appeal, does not affect the
