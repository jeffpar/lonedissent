Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Years after Livesay, the rules committee

12

considered what options should be available to

13

plaintiffs who find themselves in precisely the

14

situation the plaintiffs here claim to have found

15

themselves, having class certification denied in a case

16

where they claim the individual claims make it

17

impractical to litigate ahead on an individualized

18

basis.

19

and that this Court endorsed in Rule 23(f) in the system

20

discretionary review, the plaintiff's theory here, with

21

the voluntary dismissal tactic they wish to use, would

22

upend that carefully considered rule.

In the system that the rules committee adopted

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

MR. FISHER:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Fisher --

And it would -Please.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1
2

MR. FISHER:

And it would also contravene

statutory and case law on which it is based.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And may I ask, a lot of your

4

briefing in this case operates on the premise that there

5

really was -- that this claim will spring back, that

6

there was some kind of reservation --

7

MR. FISHER:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9
10

claim would spring back.
think that.

Yeah.
-- of rights such that this

And I'm wondering why you

Where do you get that from?

11

I mean, was this something that the parties,

12

just a general understanding in this case that they were

13

dismissing it, but that it would spring back if they won

14

the appeal?

15

MR. FISHER:

No.

There's no such

16

understanding, Justice Kagan, and there's two places to

17

look.

18

premise that we lead off our brief with.

19

And I can answer your question why we get to the

The first is the -- the stipulation and

20

judgment itself, which are in the back of the Petition

21

Appendix, from pages 34a to 39a.

22

order of judgment, and it simply says that the district

23

court grants the motion to dismiss with prejudice.

24
25

And in 39a, that's the

And so what the plaintiffs say is because of
language in the stipulation -- and here I can only

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

imagine the language in .4 on Pet. App. 36a where they

2

say:

3

judgment, plaintiffs intend to appeal the order denying

4

class certification.

After the court has entered final order and

5

Because of that piece of the stipulation,

6

it's the plaintiffs who take the position -- and now I'm

7

going to read to you, sorry, one more page here.

8

page 45 of the red brief, they say it most explicitly, I

9

think:

On

The Respondents say: Respondents did not abandon

10

their rights.

11

say, unequivocal, that:

12

reserving the right to challenge the court's ruling and

13

to revive their claims should they prevail on appeal.

14

The voluntary dismissal is -- and they
The dismissal was predicated on

So I think you have two problems here,

15

Justice Kagan.

16

exactly say what they claim it says, but it seems to be

17

the presumption that they are adopting and that the

18

Ninth Circuit seemed to have adopted.

19

The first is the actual order doesn't

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I read your brief,

20

so I have largely bought into that assumption.

21

that were true, it does seem to me like you have an

22

awfully good argument, but it would not be final, then,

23

under 1291.

24

that your brief essentially, you know, for two-thirds of

25

the brief or more, bought into that assumption, whether

And if

And I guess I was just asking why it was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

there was something that I didn't see or some general

2

understanding that the parties had that -- that

3

suggested that assumption was the right one to make.

4
5

MR. FISHER:
understanding.

6

No.

The parties had no such

All you have is what's in the paper.

We started our brief with that argument

7

because that seems to be what the Ninth Circuit

8

accepted.

9

the Ninth Circuit.

And so we started by accepting the premise of
But --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. FISHER:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13
14

You are not --

-- make no mistake -You are not embracing

that argument.
MR. FISHER:

No.

We are arguing in the

15

alternative, Justice Ginsburg.

16

if they did somehow manage to reserve a right to revive

17

their claims, what they've really done is dismiss

18

without prejudice, and there's no finality.

So what we're saying is

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

MR. FISHER:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well --

But -Either they were

22

talking about their original claims, which included the

23

class allegation, and they argued, not only at page 45

24

but also at page 49, that if the class certification

25

ruling is overturned, they, then, will have Article III

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

standing, for example, because they do have particular

2

injury, you know, the spreading of the costs of their

3

attorneys' fees, incentive payments they -- they might

4

receive.

5
6

MR. FISHER:
Mr. Chief Justice.

7

Let me -- let me be clear,

Two things about that.

The first is their defense to our mootness

8

argument is predicated on the assumption that their

9

claims spring back to life on remanded; they could

10

themselves spring them back to life.

11

the case, we agree they are not moot, but then we go

12

back to our finality argument.

13

And so if that is

But just to be precise about their argument

14

in defense of mootness, they do not propound any

15

cost-spreading or attorneys'-fee-spreading argument,

16

like the one that was made in Roper.

17

that argument.

18

argument that they would have the right to an incentive

19

award if they -- if they prevailed.

20

They do not make

The only argument they make is an

And there's two problems with that,

21

Mr. Chief Justice.

22

plaintiffs, according to lower courts, get an incentive

23

award.

24

argument, they will have dismissed their claims and not

25

prevailed.

The first is that only prevailing

And by definition, if they're in the mootness

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

And even then, the idea of an incentive

2

award, which this Court has never endorsed, of course,

3

but does exist in the lower courts, is based on the

4

notion that plaintiffs shoulder the burden of

5

litigation.

6

who filed a complaint and now would be out of the case

7

and would show no -- no burden whatsoever.

8

think that there can be an argument that they would get

9

an incentive award, even if this case were somehow

10

And here, you're talking about plaintiffs

So I don't

allowed to proceed.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, do you think that

12

should be something?

13

address that question.

14

at least in part, dependent on fact, that -- that --

15

that you would think the lower courts might have some

16

better view on than we do.

17
18
19

The -- the lower courts did not
And -- and that question seems,

Would that suggest a remand on that
question?
MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Kagan, if the

20

Court held that the plaintiffs' claims cannot be

21

revived, and so, therefore, the only question is whether

22

there's a mootness problem, we think the law is clear

23

enough -- and the reasons I just described, that it's so

24

clear that they wouldn't be entitled to an incentive

25

award based on individual claims they brought and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

immediately dismissed, but you could hold that the case

2

is flat-out moot.

3

If there were any doubt about that --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

MR. FISHER:

There was no discovery here?

There was no discovery because

6

what we had is motion practice that was based on the

7

earlier case where there were 16 months of discovery in

8

the earlier case.

9

with new plaintiffs in this case, and the parties

Remember, the -- the lawyers came in

10

stipulated that, because of the 16-month -- month record

11

that was developed the first time around, we could just

12

go straight to motions practice about whether class

13

certification was --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Fisher, you've been

15

arguing this in the alternative, but what do you think

16

is the critical fact for you?

17

their claim voluntarily?

18

their claim voluntarily with prejudice?

19

case is not moot?

20

Is it that they dismissed

Is it that they dismissed
Is it that the

What's your best argument and what's your

21

best critical fact that defines the outcome in this

22

case?

23

MR. FISHER:

I think the easiest way to

24

decide the case, Justice Sotomayor, is to say when they

25

dismissed their claims with prejudice, their claims were

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

gone forever.

And --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. FISHER: -- that's been consistent.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

Does that mean --

-- that there's no -- I

mean, I personally don't like absolutes.

6

MR. FISHER:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Uh-huh.
And so I haven't been

8

able to imagine a situation in which a case is dismissed

9

with prejudice, but where there may be some issues that

10

should survive.

11

MR. FISHER:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
And I don't -- actually

13

haven't done research on this, so I may be answering --

14

asking a question that's already been answered by our

15

case law, but let's assume an attorney sanction,

16

something of that nature.

17
18

If I don't buy an absolute, how do I
articulate it?

19

MR. FISHER:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -You dismiss with

21

prejudice all your claims, are all appeals are waived,

22

or all appeals but?

23

How do -- how do we answer that?

MR. FISHER:

So I think you can answer it in

24

two steps.

25

Deakins case, which we cite at the beginning of our

The first is you can start with the Court's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

mootness section of our brief, which I think says quite

2

clearly that when plaintiffs voluntarily abandon their

3

claims, they cannot be revived.

4

And so then the only question is whether

5

there's an exception to that rule.

6

there may be an exception for situations where

7

plaintiffs dismiss their claims after a ruling from the

8

trial court that decimates their claims on the merits.

9

And so as the Court put it in the old Thompson case in

10

the 1800s, when all that was left was just to make the

11

appeal more expeditious when the plaintiffs have already

12

lost on the merits, then a voluntary dismissal does not

13

necessarily preclude an appeal.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I think that

Isn't that the -Can you give me an example

16

of -- of what that would -- you have an antitrust case

17

and the court insist that the market be interpreted so

18

narrowly that the case doesn't make much sense, would

19

that work?

20

MR. FISHER:

Well, actually, the

21

hypothetical you just said, Justice Kennedy, is quite

22

close to the Thompson case itself, which was an

23

antitrust case.

24

that said you're going to have to prove unreasonableness

25

of the restraint of trade.

And the Court issued a ruling pretrial

And the plaintiffs said,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

well, all we can prove is a restraint of trade.

2

you're going to tell us we have to prove

3

unreasonableness, we can't do that.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

MR. FISHER:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And if

How about --

And so ---

evidentiary ruling --

7

an adverse evidentiary ruling under Daubert this expert

8

can't testify?

9

MR. FISHER:

10
11
12

By and large, that is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it decimates your

case.
MR. FISHER:

Well, if it truly decimated

13

your case, then perhaps, at least according to some of

14

the lower courts, you could take an appeal from a

15

voluntary dismissal.

16

ruling would not allow that tactic.

17

Evans case, which goes all the way back to shortly after

18

the founding where the government itself was at trial

19

and a district judge precluded one of the government's

20

witnesses from testifying.

21

dismissed, tried to take an appeal to this Court, and

22

this Court dismissed the appeal.

23

But the garden variety evidentiary

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that's the

The government then

And what you're creating

24

with that is not just -- it's not just a small loophole.

25

What you're creating is an enormous gap, because any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

interlocutory order could be characterized by the party

2

that loses as something that's critical to the case.

3

any interlocutory order could then -- could then be

4

appealed.

5

MR. FISHER:

So

Well, Justice Alito, I think

6

you could take an absolutely firm position to preclude

7

that possibility.

8

the case like Justice Sotomayor does and say, can we at

9

least leave open for another day the possibility of a

But I think if you were to approach

10

pretrial ruling that truly decimated the merits allowing

11

an appeal, I think you could say that too.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

MR. FISHER:

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what -- what --

If I could add --- would be the definition

15

of a ruling -- well, what is decimate the merits?

16

does that mean?

17

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that you have

18

effectively already lost on the merits.

19

to go forward because of a ruling that goes to the

20

substance of your claims.

21

What

It's impossible

And I would just hasten to add that whatever

22

the rule might be and whether it's absolute or whether

23

there's an exception, this is the easiest case possible,

24

because the Court has said over and over again that a

25

class-certification ruling has nothing to do with the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

merits.

2

So that's -JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't understand how it

3

normally works, which I'm sure trial judges must face

4

this all the time.

5

has nothing left of his case.

6

nothing really left of my case.

7

summary judgment or -- and let them move for the

8

defendant. You -- I -- it must be weird if the defendant

9

doesn't.

10
11

The plaintiff has lost a motion.

He

He says, Judge, I have
They can move for

I mean, I can't imagine such a case.
But if he didn't, I guess the trial court

would say, defendant, move for summary judgment.

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then if he just refused

14

to, I don't know what would happen.

15

plaintiff could go and ask for a mandamus of the trial

16

court to insist that they move for summary judgment.

17

The case is over.

18

I guess the

How does it work.

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think by and large,

19

Justice Breyer, in your hypothetical, the defendant, of

20

course, would move for summary judgment.

21

defendant didn't, the district judge might bring the

22

parties in for a conference and say, is there anything

23

left of this case?

24

that's going to get worked out in the ordinary course of

25

business.

Should we go ahead?

Alderson Reporting Company

Or if the

And of course

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

It would be the defendant

2

who moves for summary judgment, and then it will be

3

entered in his favor.

4

course, will have an appeal.

5
6

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

And -- and

that's --

7
8

And then the plaintiff, of

JUSTICE BREYER:

I would think that was the

normal system.

9

MR. FISHER:

Absolutely.

And that's what's

10

so different than this case, is that the plaintiffs even

11

now don't claim there's anything wrong with the judgment

12

against them.

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

Well, but there's a

lot --

15
16

They asked --

MR. FISHER:

-- for the judgment against

them.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's a lot left

18

of their case, but just the individual claims, not the

19

class claims; right?

20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. FISHER:

Well, there are no class

claims, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

So what's

left of their case are the individual claims.
MR. FISHER:

Well, they've given up their

individual claims.

Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FISHER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I know, but --

I'm sorry, Your Honor.
-- that's like any

4

appeal.

5

lose, you appeal.

6

about this case, of course, is that the -- their loss

7

was -- was entered voluntarily, and I think the critical

8

point you argue, whatever they're appealing, it isn't

9

that they shouldn't have lost.

When you have an issue -- a claim left and you
Now, the only thing that's different

10

MR. FISHER:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.
But it's not as if

12

there's nothing left of the case.

13

case is their -- their individual claims.

14

MR. FISHER:

What's left of the

Well, their claims have been

15

given away, remember, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

if I -- I don't want to miss what you're asking me.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. FISHER:

And I -- maybe

Well --

But either they have revived --

19

either they've reserved the right to revive their

20

claims, in which case I would agree, their individual

21

claims are still alive, but we don't have a final

22

judgment --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MR. FISHER:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

I --

-- or they've given them away.

Alderson Reporting Company

Their -- their

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

claims are alive prior to their -- their voluntary

2

dismissal.

3

MR. FISHER:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

MR. FISHER:

That's right.
Okay.

That's right.

But when they

6

ask for that voluntarily -- that voluntary dismissal,

7

the district judge gave them exactly what they wanted.

8

And on appeal, they're not claim anything wrong with

9

that dismissal.

10

They're not claiming -- so there's no

adversity in the way Justice Breyer --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you explain to me just

12

how does it work in an ordinary case?

13

special in this respect.

A class action is

I bring a class action.

14

MR. FISHER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.
The defendant, I say, has

16

told the biggest lie anyone has ever told and it

17

violates 19 statutes.

18

damaged only to the extent of 10 cents.

Unfortunately, my client is

it.

All right?

Uh-huh.

Now it's going to be worth

And the judge says, no, you can't.

23

MR. FISHER:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

But I'd like to bring a

Uh-huh.
All right.

what is the plaintiff supposed to do?

Alderson Reporting Company

At that point,

You think the

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

judge's ruling is wrong?

2

claim that's only going to be worth 10 cents, because,

3

of that, he's most likely to get no more than two cents

4

for the lawyer himself.

5

MR. FISHER:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

Right.
All right.

So -- so what

is supposed to happen?

8
9

He doesn't want to pursue a

MR. FISHER:

Well, that's exactly the

problem the rules committee considered, Justice Breyer.

10

And what they held is that in that situation, the

11

plaintiffs can go to a court of appeals and ask for a

12

discretionary appeal and say -- they can argue just

13

exactly as you did, that our claim isn't worth it on an

14

individualized basis and for that reason, you should a

15

grant us a right to an interlocutory appeal.

16

If that right, however, is -- I'm sorry.

If

17

that request is denied by the court of appeals, then the

18

plaintiffs are in the exact position of the plaintiffs

19

in Livesay --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. FISHER:

22
23

But in -- in --

-- where the Court unanimously

held -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In that -- that position,

24

because this Court rejected the death-knell rule.

25

may well be a death-knell, but then this Court said no

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

death-knell.

2

MR. FISHER:

Exactly, Justice Ginsburg.

And

3

the Court rejected it unanimously for many good reasons.

4

Most importantly, it rejected it because of the proper

5

balance between trial courts and courts of appeals.

6

even if the plaintiffs say we have a death-knell

7

situation and even if it really is, there are very real

8

costs on the judicial system that it would be imposed by

9

a right to automatic appeal.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

So just -Do you have --

-- out of curiosity -- I'm

sorry.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have any idea

15

what the statistics show about how often appellate

16

courts grant interlocutory appeals under 23(f)?

17

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

That's in the briefing,

18

Mr. Chief Justice.

19

it's around 20 -- a little bit over 20 percent.

20

it --

21
22

So

It's in a couple of footnotes.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

And

And what criteria did they

But what did they really

Did they, you know, basically take a peek at the
What did they do?

4

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

They -- they might take a

5

peek under the -- well, you -- if the merits of the

6

class-certification motion, of course.

7

under the rug of the merits of the case itself to see

8

whether it's worth their time, as the Ninth Circuit may

9

well have done here.

10

Sometimes a peek

Also, as I was just saying, the plaintiffs

11

can argue that -- that, otherwise, it's the death-knell

12

of their case.

13

are making here, the exact problem they're presenting to

14

the Court is what the rules committee said in its notes

15

is a proper basis for a Rule 23(f) appeals.

16

And so the exact argument the plaintiffs

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we made one change, I

17

think, that would be favorable to the plaintiffs; that

18

is, 1292(b) is double discretion.

19

permission from the district court and then again from

20

the court of appeals.

21

22

district court.

23

You have to get

In 23(f), it's only the court of

You don't need to get permission from the

MR. FISHER:

That's right, Justice Ginsburg.

24

And so there's actually two things that are important

25

here.

One is, yes, plaintiffs are better off in class

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

actions than in ordinary cases for that reason.

2

And on the other hand, the cost to the

3

judicial system of allowing an automatic right to appeal

4

to be manufactured the way they would here are higher in

5

the class action realm.

6

Rule 23(c), which says that denials of class

7

certification or grants, for that matter, are inherently

8

tentative and even district judge -- district judges can

9

reconsider them.

10

And that's partly because of

So a plaintiff faced with a genuine

11

death-knell situation, this Court held in Livesay,

12

should go forward.

If they believe in their case, they

13

should go forward.

The district judge might reconsider

14

his view.

15

way they're making their arguments, whether it's the

16

certification of the class or the particular claims

17

they're bringing.

18

maybe motions practice will end the case.

19

believe in their case, the Court held in Livesay the

20

plaintiffs have a remedy to go forward and then take an

21

appeal at that point.

22

The plaintiffs might want to repackage the

If that fails, they should go ahead,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if they

Well, but -- but as

23

a practical matter, that's not going to happen, right?

24

I mean, they have just their individual claim.

25

it's worth in Justice Breyer's case 10 cents.

Alderson Reporting Company

It's -And you

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

say, well, you can go forward with the whole litigation

2

that's premised on class allegations and something is

3

involving an enormous amount of discovery like this

4

case.

5

because the practical reality is they're not going to go

6

forward.

7

I mean, you know, their point is that you win

MR. FISHER:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, first

8

of all, and maybe a 10-cent hypothetical is rather in

9

the extreme, but the --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Given the expense --

11

given the expense of litigation, it can be $10,000 and

12

it's still not going to be worth it to go forward.

13

MR. FISHER:

Well, it might well be for a

14

couple of reasons, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

is added as an empirical matter that the 1996 study

16

that's cited in the briefs that led to Rule 23(f) cites

17

multiple instances of plaintiffs going ahead in cases

18

after they've been denied class certification.

19

there's a couple of reasons why they might do that; take

20

this case as an example.

21

First of all, it

And so

The State laws under which they're trying to

22

prevail on -- on the merits have fee shifting

23

provisions, and so the Court is quite familiar with

24

scenarios where plaintiffs go ahead with low dollar

25

cases or, indeed, no dollar cases with the prospect of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

fee shifting ahead.

2

taken lightly.

3

to their advantage.

4

And, you know, that should not be

That's something the plaintiffs can use

Also, the key is whether the plaintiffs

5

believe in their case, I think.

6

believe in their case, I think there's every reason to

7

go ahead.

8

much believe in their case, every incentive is to -- to

9

have litigation go the way this has, which is ten years

10

of fighting about class certification with not a single

11

motion yet on the merits.

12

a situation like this to the judicial system, not just

13

to the cost of appellate courts, of being forced to

14

weigh in on potentially very difficult and complex class

15

certification issues that would otherwise wash out of

16

the case, but also defendants being forced to undergo a

17

tactic that it does not have when the converse is the

18

case.

19

certification, defendants have no way to manufacture an

20

automatic right to appeal.

If the plaintiffs

The difficulty is, if the plaintiffs don't so

And that's the difficulty of

In other words, where there's a grant of class

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. FISHER:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This is --

And that was another element -This is a case where

24

there were two Rule 23(f) motions, both denied, and

25

we're talking about the same court of appeals.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

Was there any effort when this appeal, the

2

case that's now before us, to -- to get it to the same

3

panel?

4

the...

We had three different panels, didn't we, for

5

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, to be

6

precise, actually there are two different cases, so

7

there was a first case where class certification was

8

denied, and then Rule 23(f) was denied.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MR. FISHER:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. FISHER:

And then you have --

And that case went away --

Right.

-- two cases here -And then you had the

13

second case, which is the one we have here, and then it

14

went up to Rule 23(f), to the Ninth Circuit, and a

15

motions panel looked at that and denied review.

16

think the way the Ninth Circuit procedures work is that

17

motions panels are simply different than case merits

18

panels.

19

And I

Microsoft did ask, upon the filing of the

20

appeal that is before you right now, that if the Ninth

21

Circuit to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction at

22

the outset.

23

over to our regular panel, and that's how we got to

24

where we are today.

25

But what the Ninth Circuit did was scoot it

JUSTICE ALITO:

It is odd that the panel

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

that decided the case, finally decided the case,

2

apparently thought that this -- there was a proper

3

ground for this to go forward as a class -- as a class

4

action, right?

5

MR. FISHER:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

No.

No, Justice Alito --

Well, they said the class --

the class allegations were improperly dismissed.

8

MR. FISHER:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

MR. FISHER:

Right.

So --

Were they not?

Let me say two things.

One is,

11

to be precise about what the Ninth Circuit panel held,

12

all they held was that the district judge abused his

13

discretion by misreading a Ninth Circuit case concerning

14

whether or not class certification was appropriate.

15

The Ninth Circuit did not consider whether

16

class certification was actually appropriate, or even

17

whether the causation argument that is at the center of

18

Microsoft's objection to class certification was

19

correct.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, okay.

Well, let me --

21

let me state it more precisely.

22

final decision of the Ninth Circuit was that there had

23

been an error by the district court regarding --

24

MR. FISHER:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

The panel -- the -- the

Right.
-- class action

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1
2

certification.
MR. FISHER:

That's correct, and I think it

3

goes to the nature and actually the benefit of

4

Rule 23(f)'s discretionary review system, which is, just

5

to use this Court as an example, it might deny

6

certiorari on a meritorious claim, thinking, though,

7

that the error would be harmless in any event or some

8

other ground.

9

thought that ultimately, even though the district judge

So the Ninth Circuit may well have

10

might have misread one of its cases, ultimately class

11

certification is going to be denied anyway.

12

the plaintiffs are going to lose on the merits anyway.

13

It's not worth their time.

14

Ultimately

And so what this plaintiff tactic is about

15

doing, again, is foisting onto courts of appeals,

16

appeals that often are actually directly turned down and

17

requiring them to expend significant resources --

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

That -- I -- I

19

understand all that.

20

if this -- if a 23(f) appeal had been presented to the

21

panel that decided the case that is now before us, can

22

you say that they would have refused to hear the appeal?

23
24
25

But what I'm -- I'm getting at is,

MR. FISHER:

I might be able to say that.

will actually tell you that just by happenstance -JUSTICE ALITO:

How would that --

Alderson Reporting Company

I

27
1

MR. FISHER:

-- one of the judges who was on

2

the -- one -- one of the judges who was on the motion

3

panel that denied the 23(f) petition was on the merits

4

panel that decided the case in front of you today.

5

that -- that one judge we know, at least, voted to

6

reject the 23(f) appeal, but was forced into taking this

7

one instead.

8
9
10

JUSTICE ALITO:

So

Well, how would that be

consistent with the -- the reasoning of the panel that
decided the case that's before us?

11

MR. FISHER:

Because, remember, go back to

12

the idea why we have discretionary review in the first

13

place, Justice Alito.

14

even if they're confronted with a situation where the

15

district court might have made an error in an initial

16

ruling on class certification, there's a few things that

17

may cause a court of appeals nevertheless to deny 23(f)

18

appeal.

19

It's because courts of appeals,

The first is the Ninth Circuit may say to

20

itself, this case is just in its infancy.

21

22

take place.

23

claims.

24

himself his class certification motions.

25

district court proceedings will just take care of this.

We'd like

Maybe the plaintiffs will reformulate their

Maybe the district judge will reconsider for

Alderson Reporting Company

And maybe the

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

Ninth Circuit may also have thought, look:

2

The claims here, on the merits, look remarkably weak,

3

and so why should we expend our resources answering

4

difficult class certification issues against the

5

backdrop of a case that's going to die out anyways on

6

the merits.

7

And there are any of a number of other

8

reasons.

9

as to say just simply docket congestion can be a reason

In fact, the rules committee notes go so far

10

for the court of appeals to say, look:

11

a run-of-the-mill appeal.

12

important items in front of us.

13

This looks like

We have other -- other more

So the -- the important point here, though,

14

is that the plaintiffs' system would completely upend

15

that regime.

16

about Rule 23(f), and as I said, and the committee notes

17

considered the exact problem the plaintiffs are

18

propounding to you here, and said the best we can do is

19

discretionary review.

20

The rules committee thought very hard

Remember, the plaintiffs are actually better

21

off -- and I think this might have been

22

Justice Ginsburg's point -- post-1998, than they were

23

for 20 years after Livesay.

24

the Court faced in Livesay, it unanimously held that

25

there should be no automatic immediate appeal from

Even in the situation that

2

circumstance, the Court was quite firm, and I think for

3

some very good reasons.

4

And so even in that

If there are any other questions about what

5

I've said so far, I'm happy to answer them; otherwise,

I'll reserve the remainder of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Stris.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

10

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

11
12

Thank you, counsel.

MR. STRIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

13

If a district court commits prejudicial

14

nonharmless error, our core position is that a plaintiff

15

can bet her whole case on its reversal.

16

to begin where Justice Kagan began and explain why, as a

17

procedural matter, the parties have been litigating this

18

case as if the claims would spring back to life, and

19

then I'd like to explain why I think that's permitted.

20

And so I'd like

So in this case we followed a 20-year-old

21

Ninth Circuit procedure in seeking a conditional

22

dismissal with prejudice, and I -- I think I need to put

23

some meat on the bones here so we kind of understand the

24

procedure.

25

This date -- and it's not unusual for the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

Ninth Circuit.

2

Concha that interpreted Rule 41.

3

from that case.

4

This dates back to 1995 in a case called
And I'm going to quote

Here's what the Ninth Circuit said:

Quote,

5

"A voluntary dismissal with prejudice permits the

6

appellate court to review the action that caused him to

7

dismiss his case."

8

remand motion.

9

In Concha it was the denial of a

If the plaintiff prevails on appeal and the

10

district court ruling is reversed, then the claim is

11

remanded to the district court for further proceedings.

12

So it's not a surprise that most of my

13

friend Mr. Fisher's brief is kind of under the

14

supposition that the claims would spring back to life,

15

because that's what everyone assumed in -- in the lower

16

court.

We followed that procedure and --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

wasn't a class action.

19

MR. STRIS:

20
21

For some reason, that

That -- that was not a class

action -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- but here you

22

have -- you -- you have the individual claim.

23

say it's not worth a candle, but you -- you have the

24

individual claim, and that's what you have relinquished

25

in -- in order to take your appeal.

Alderson Reporting Company

You may

31
1

MR. STRIS:

2

characterization, Justice Ginsburg.

3

it directly, but what I was saying a moment ago was just

4

to explain that procedurally, what we attempted to do

5

was conditionally dismiss so that everything would

6

spring back to life.

7
8

So I don't agree with that
I'm going to answer

Now, I -- I would like to answer your
question --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

MR. STRIS:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Just before the --

Yeah.
So there -- there is this

12

one case that suggested that that is what would happen.

13

I mean, is this a procedure that's used in the Ninth

14

Circuit?

15

that this was the governing law?

16

What is it used for?

MR. STRIS:

Why did people think

So, yes, it's not one case.

If

17

you look at pages I think 3 to 4 of our appellate brief

18

in the Ninth Circuit, we cite many cases where this

19

happened in the Ninth Circuit.

20

the look of surprise on your face, but this is the

21

procedure in many circuits.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, in fact, I -- I see

You didn't do that.

23

You said -- you said you -- a piece of paper I have

24

here, whether it's a little technical, but it says this

25

action you moved and would be granted, should be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

dismissed with prejudice.

2
3

Then in the next paragraph you say you
intend to appeal.

Is that a reservation?

4

MR. STRIS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is, and let me explain.
How do I know that it's a

6

reservation?

7

can't just express a future intent, and we're being

8

technical.

It says you have to make a conditional

9

dismissal.

We dismiss under the condition that we

10

There's a lot of case law that says you

are -- you know, that we're going to appeal.

11

MR. STRIS:

I understand, Justice Breyer.

12

I'm going to explain why it is a conditional dismissal,

13

and I definitely will get back to your question,

14

Justice Ginsburg, about why I think this is permitted in

15

the class action context.

16

So here's why, Justice Breyer.

There's

17

long -- there's a long line of cases from the Ninth

18

Circuit about how you enter a conditional dismissal.

19

You have to make clear that there's no settlement.

20

That's a requirement in the Ninth Circuit.

21

in paragraph 6.

22

Appendix.

23

final judgment, you intend to appeal a prior adverse

24

order.

25

Appendix 36A.

We did that

It's on page 36A of the Petition

And then you have to make clear that after

We did that in paragraph 4.

Alderson Reporting Company

This is Petition

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

And so you don't have to take my word for

2

it.

3

pages 3 to 4 where we explain what we were doing that

4

the Ninth Circuit accepted, and we cite a number of

5

cases where this is used, we followed the procedure in

6

the Ninth Circuit for doing a conditional --

If you look at appellate brief in the Ninth Circuit

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MR. STRIS:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10
11

-- there isn't -Maybe now is the

time for you to answer Justice Ginsburg's question.
(Laughter.)

13

MR. STRIS:

15

-- dismissal with prejudice.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

14

There isn't --

I -- I -- I would -- I would

love to.
So the reason why I think this is permitted

16

in -- in the class action context is because there's two

17

things you need to do in -- in order to have your claim

18

spring back to life.

19

dismissal, but that is to avoid a waiver argument.

And

20

then secondly, you have to show prejudicial error.

And

21

let me explain why that applies here.

22

One, you have to condition your

So what -- our theory is that what we have

23

are individual claims that we're entitled to litigate on

24

a class basis -- of course, if we satisfy Rule 23.

25

so our theory is that when the class allegations were

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

stricken, we were deprived of that substantial right.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let me ask you, because

3

you mentioned Rule 23.

4

lot of work to figure out what to do with an

5

interlocutory ruling on class action status.

6

came up with 23(f).

7

way to get around 23(f).

8
9
10

The rule makers went through a

And it

And this device seems to be just a

And -- and on your theory, would you at
least, before you go to this voluntary dismissal, have
to try the 23(f) route?

11

MR. STRIS:

I -- so I think every

12

plaintiffs' lawyer certainly would, and it goes to the

13

core of why --

14
15
16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But would you have to on

your theory?
MR. STRIS:

I don't -- you would not have

17

to, but let me tell you why plaintiffs' lawyers would,

18

and -- because it points up why at why this is not an

19

end run around Rule 23.

20

So there's nothing in the balance struck by

21

Rule 23(f) that suggests, we submit, any intent to

22

either penalize or prevent plaintiffs from obtaining a

23

final judgment by betting their case.

24

at the Advisory Committee notes -- we cite this in our

25

brief -- there -- there was a circuit split at the time

Alderson Reporting Company

And if you look

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

as to whether or not this procedure was appropriate.

2

The Advisory Committee was aware of that.

3

cited the Second Circuit case from 1990 that permitted

4

this.

5

They -- they

So Microsoft's position, in essence, is that

6

Rule 23(f) rewrote the definition of finality without

7

mentioning it.

8
9

Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But they could have.

If

the rule makers wanted to have these class action

10

decisions go up on appeal as of right, they could have

11

made it, or asked Congress to make it, one of the

12

interlocutory orders that is immediately appealable,

13

like a preliminary injunction.

14

MR. STRIS:

Certainly.

But then the -- the

15

plaintiff would have been risking nothing.

16

words, to go so far as to say you have an appeal of

17

right and -- and your case continues is different than

18

what happened here.

19

In other

Let me use Livesay as an example.

I think

20

it kind of points up at the point.

21

Cecil Livesay -- this -- this is at page 106 of the

22

Joint Appendix in Livesay.

23

Eighth Circuit that even if his certification was

24

denied, he was going to continue litigating his

25

individual claim.

So in Livesay,

Cecil Livesay told the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Page 16 of the Joint Appendix in Livesay,

2

Cecil Livesay continued litigating his individual claim,

even after it was decertified.

4

case continued and it was actually settled for

5

$1.3 million, even after the Livesays lost in this

6

Court.

7

interlocutory mechanism and a voluntary conditional

8

dismissal.

That's the critical difference between an

And as a result, that

action?

But -- did -- did it go

Was it litigated as a class

MR. STRIS:

Well, it couldn't be because -Yes.

-- but -- but they settled as a

18

of a true interlocutory appeal.

19

appeal is not like a conditional dismissal.

20

And -- and that points up at the nature

But you have just said, I

21

take it, that, yes, it's the plaintiff's choice.

can give, hopefully, a more satisfactory answer in the

5

following way.

6

Even though 23(f) exists, a plaintiff could

7

choose, after a class allegation is stricken, to

8

litigate their individual claims to final judgment and

9

then appeal.

There's nothing in Rule 23(f) that -- in

10

fact, that's what Microsoft suggests you should do.

11

there's nothing in Rule 23(f) to suggest that -- that

12

because it was an escape hatch, if you were, that it

13

intended to lock the front door.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

23(f) is about a class action.

16

individual action.

MR. STRIS:

So the --

It's not about an

miscommunicated.

19

class that is not certified and you think that's wrong,

20

if you eventually litigate the case on the -- on the

21

merits through a trial and you win, you can appeal from

22

that final judgment, and the fact that you could have

23

taken an interlocutory appeal earlier under 23(f)

24

doesn't change that.

25

appeal earlier under 23(f), it --

What I'm saying is, if you have a

MR. STRIS:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the --

-- doesn't change that.
-- but any final

4

judgment, when it's all over, you can bring up

5

everything.

6

MR. STRIS:

Right.

And our -- our

7

principle, our theory of this case, is that any final

8

judgment means that the case is over and there's nothing

9

left for the district court to do.

This is a final

10

judgment.

11

final judgment doesn't mean that the case isn't final.

It doesn't --

It may be manufactured, but a manufactured

MR. STRIS:

MR. STRIS:

a prior adverse order.

23

You said there were two things that you did that
You said it

We said we were going to appeal

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

So where -- where

24

did those requirements come from?

25

at what cases would I find that that's what you have to

Alderson Reporting Company

You know, if I looked

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

do in order to prejudice -- in order to dismiss

2

something with prejudice in such a way that it springs

3

back to life if you win the appeal?

4

MR. STRIS:

So the cases -- the cases you

5

find on pages 2 to 3 or 3 to 4 of our Ninth Circuit

6

brief.

7

Circuit cases.

8

cites a First Circuit case called Johns, I think.

Concha is the leading case.

9

There's other Ninth

I think Olmstead is one of them.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It

Yeah, but the problem is --

10

and it is a problem for you -- that there are other

11

circuits.

12

mean, my law clerk has one here.

13

of the brief.

And other circuits have a different rule.

14

I

I guess she got it out

It says, "A settlement" -- let's see.

Where

15

are we here?

16

from the Eight Circuit, or Fifth, I don't know.

17

says, "An expression of intent is not a reservation of a

18

right to appeal."

19

It's wright.

It's called Wright.

So you're in a dilemma.

It's
It

If you say I

20

condition my dismissal upon my later appealing, you run

21

into the case, which happens to be our case rather than

22

the Ninth Circuit's called Lybrand, which says then the

23

judgment isn't final.

24

something, you're in the box you're in right now and the

25

case is over.

But if you don't reserve

And so you think of this thing called

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

"intent," which is perhaps an unknown creature before

2

you thought of it.

3

I don't know.

And then you say, aha.

We're not really

4

conditionally dismissing, so we're not out for that

5

reason, but we all are reserving an intent, and

6

therefore, we get to say that it's final and can appeal

for you.

11
12

The Rules Committee, having worried about

We'll give you that (f) interlocutory appeal.
Now, why should I not think about the case

just that way?
MR. STRIS:

So I -- I think even if you do

13

think about the case that way, we're right, Justice

14

Breyer, and -- and here's why.

15

dismiss with conditional prejudice.

16

did not happen here, then I think the case comes to you

17

on those terms.

18

You certainly need to
If you think that

The Ninth Circuit thought that.

But if you dismiss with conditional

19

prejudice, what you said is that this runs square up

20

against Livesay.

21

the reason I disagree with you is Livesay was a true

22

interlocutory appeal.

23

is not a formalistic distinction with no practical

24

significance.

25

and here's why:

That's where I disagree with you.

It was an ongoing case.

And that

That's the whole enchilada in my view,

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

In an ongoing case, we -- we know that

2

Justice Stevens and the Court in Livesay didn't think

3

that people didn't have the right to continue, because

4

if they did, why would the various circuits have

5

developed these unbelievably complicated and difficult

6

tests where they were doing evidentiary hearings in the

7

district court and then reviewing it on appeal?

In an interlocutory posture, the core
problem with the death-knell doctrine was that it was

rule.

12

it's manufactured or not, and this goes back to your

13

question, Justice Ginsburg.

14

really, you know, vigorously advocated my position on

15

this.

Of course it undermined the final judgment

But if you have a true final judgment, whether

16

I -- I feel like I haven't

I really believe that Rule 23(f) says

17

nothing on this question because it was changing things.

18

It was giving people options, but they were

interlocutory options.

20

presumption was not that the case would be stayed.

21

presumption was not that if you lost, you couldn't

continue litigating your individual claim.

MR. STRIS:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
But if there's no

agreement, then you plead guilty; you've waived.

seems to be a separate procedure that you're describing.

14

What's the circuit split?

15
16
17

MR. STRIS:

There

So I'll -- I'll -- I'm going to

answer that and I want to say three things.
The first is there's actually a series of

18

circuit splits.

19

can be done in the multiclaim context where the Second

20

Circuit and Federal Circuit say you can.

21

they -- they embrace the same theory.

22

you have a core claim that you really -- it's your

23

primary claim and it's dismissed a 12(b)(6) summary

24

judgment, but your peripheral claim exists -- persists,

25

every circuit would say you could dismiss that without

There's a circuit split on whether this

But the Second

Well, that's a different

But -- and you've spoken a lot about Ninth

But what is your best support in any case

8

from this Court for the proposition that a voluntary

decision?

MR. STRIS:

In -- in Procter & Gamble, Your

13

order saying that the United States had to turn over a

14

grand jury transcript.

15

look at the oral argument, the parties conceded it had

16

no effect on the -- the -- the plaintiff's case, the

17

government's case.

18

And in Procter & Gamble, you have a discovery

If you read the briefing, if you

It was a purely --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that had everything

19

to do with the merits because the argument was secrecy.

20

If the government's position was, well, if we turn over

21

the transcript, we've -- we've lost, the whole thing is

22

about the government secrecy plea.

23

essentially to review a merits ruling that is rejecting

24

the secrecy plea.

25

MR. STRIS:

So they were seeking

Well, I don't think I agree,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

Justice Ginsburg.

2

government had antitrust claims against the soap

3

companies.

4

It was an antitrust case where the

And -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But they were ordered

5

to -- the government was ordered to turn over a grand

6

jury transcript; right?

7

MR. STRIS:

That's correct.

And the reason

8

this is important and it answers Justice Alito's

9

question is, the government -- that was a collateral

10

order that the government felt strongly that they

11

shouldn't have to obey.

12

order them under Rule 37 to turn it over or we're going

13

to terminate the case.

14

The -- the -- the Court did not

The government, Justice Alito, went to the

15

Court and said:

16

want -- because it was likely, as Procter & Gamble

17

pointed out, that they just would have imposed an

18

evidentiary sanction or an adverse-inference sanction.

19

The government said:

20

impose a terminating sanction so we can appeal what

21

would otherwise be an interlocutory ruling.

22

When you decide what sanction you

Please don't do that.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Please

Well, it's one thing when a

23

party who suffered a very serious adverse ruling on an

24

interlocutory order says:

25

and enter judgment for the other side.

Okay, we give up; go ahead

Alderson Reporting Company

That's one

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1
2

thing.
It's quite another thing, possibly, when the

3

party that has suffered this ruling moves for a

4

voluntary dismissal.

5

defeats every thing that you asked for.

6

possibility that you would get attorney's fees or an

7

incentive award or anything else, if that -- if you are

8

keeping that still on the table, if that is still on the

9

table, then the order isn't final --

An order cannot be final unless it

10

MR. STRIS:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

So any

Well, I --- I would say.

And the

12

only basis for rejecting everything that you might

13

possibly get was your request -- if you read the order

14

that way, was your request that it be -- that it be

15

rejected with prejudice.

16

MR. STRIS:

But -- but that's precisely what

17

happened in Procter & Gamble and that's precisely the

18

argument that Procter & Gamble made.

19

Justice Alito --

20
21
22
23

JUSTICE ALITO:

The United States,

Well, tell me what's wrong

with that as a matter of first principles.
MR. STRIS:

Well, what's wrong with our

position, or with rejecting our position?

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

MR. STRIS:

No.

With what I just said.

I think what's wrong with that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

is it runs square up against what the long-standing

2

definition of finality has always been.

3

never held, Justice Alito, that a technical final

4

judgment for practical considerations is not final.

5

fact, this Court has repeatedly said, and I quote, "a

6

final judgment always is a final decision."

7

This Court has

In

And that's true because that -- the point of

8

the final judgment rule is that if there's nothing left

9

for the district court to do, you can take an appeal.

10

The -- the mere possibility of appellate reversal has no

11

bearing on whether a case is final or not; otherwise, no

12

judgment would ever be final.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, no.

But

14

you're -- you're -- the reversal that you're looking for

15

does not go to the merits of the judgment that you

16

voluntarily agreed to have entered against you.

17

that's what raises the Article III question.

18

that you're arguing on appeal is going to change the

19

fact that you lose.

20

MR. STRIS:

It's --

Nothing

So I was answering a finality

21

question, and I'd like to -- I'd like to explain it and

22

then pivot back to that.

23

What I'm saying is as a matter of whether

24

this satisfies Rule 1291, the -- the fact that things

25

could spring back to life if we win on appeal is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

irrelevant, because any judgment could spring back to

2

life if you win on appeal.

3

relevant to the question of finality.

4

Appellate reversal is not

Now, you've asked a slightly different

5

question, I would submit, Mr. Chief Justice, which is:

6

Well, don't we have an adverseness problem under

7

Article III?

8

well.

9

this on page 29 of the red brief, the Court made clear

And I think the answer there is no as

Over a hundred years ago in Ketchum, that we cite

10

that consent -- and that was a case involving literally

11

a settlement -- doesn't undermine jurisdiction.

12

presents a merit question of waiver.

13

Let me read you what --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It

Well, it's not --

15

it's not simply the fact that you consented.

16

the arguments you're making do not go -- they're not a

17

reason why you should win, because you've already had

18

judgment entered against you.

19

like a normal appeal, if you've got a judgment entered

20

against you and you have arguments why it shouldn't have

21

been.

22

judgment against you, so you can't argue that it

23

shouldn't have done that.

24
25

It is that

It's one thing -- it's

But you told the district court to enter a

MR. STRIS:
going on there.

So I guess there's a few things

The reason I disagree is I think that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

there's a question of jurisdiction, a question of

2

waiver, and then a question of appellate procedure.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about Procter &

4

Gamble, which you -- you've cited a number of times in

5

this argument?

6

plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses a complaint may not

7

appeal that decision.

8
9

But I thought that that decision said a

MR. STRIS:

Oh, no, no.

So there's a long

line of cases that say a voluntary nonsuit, which is a

10

dismissal without prejudice, can appeal.

11

obviously right, because the plaintiff could refile that

12

case at any time.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's

But in Procter & Gamble,

14

the Court was very careful to say when the government

15

proposed dismissal for failure to obey, it had lost on

16

the merits.

17

MR. STRIS:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MR. STRIS:

And what -That is not your case.

Oh, it most certainly is,

20

because what the Court meant there was had lost on the

21

merits of the discovery ruling.

22

context, both parties agree -- you can look at the

23

briefing; you can look at the oral argument -- both

24

sides concede that the discovery ruling saying you have

25

to turn over the grand jury transcript did not touch on

If you read it in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

the claim at all.

2

couldn't win.

3

It did not make it so the government

It didn't impair the claim.

So back to your question, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

The three levels of analysis.

5

jurisdiction, there has to be finality and adverseness.

6

I actually think those are easy questions for us.

7

There's nothing left for the district court to do.

8

fact that -- that it could have something to do if

9

there's an appeal has never made a judgment nonfinal.

For appellate

The

10

On adverseness, we didn't consent to this.

11

We -- we -- we asked for a voluntary dismissal, but we

12

did it with a condition.

13

Procter & Gamble.

14

question, they said:

15

the dismissal, but you did it so you could appeal the

16

prior adverse ruling.

17

It's exactly the same as

When the Court analyzed the waiver
Well, you may have consented to

And in oral arguments, there's an exchange

18

between Abe Fortas, who represented Procter & Gamble,

19

and Justice Frankfurter, where it's clear that that was

20

a waiver case.

21

Well, they may have consented to having the case

22

dismissed, but --

23

And what Justice Frankfurter said was:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there anything terrible

24

that would happen if, say, the precedent leaves this

25

open, and looking to try to simplify procedure, we'd

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50

say:

2

your position.

3

under F.

If we take the other side, we leave to people in

4

Ask the Court of appeals for permission

Now, sometimes they'll wrongfully deny it.

5

Well, if they wrongly deny it, here's what you do.

6

litigate your case and lose, or give up and then appeal

7

that final judgment for them.

8
9

Go

Now, there could be a few cases where that
won't work either.

But they're likely to be so few and

10

far between that the simplicity of that and people

11

knowing what to do is better than having 14 different

12

cases in conflict in the different circuits and trying

13

to figure out what we're trying to figure out now.

14

What's the answer to what I've just said?

15

MR. STRIS:

The answer, Justice Breyer, is I

16

think a number of terrible things happen.

17

is you restrict the ability of parties to do this

18

bilaterally, which happens much more often than

19

unilaterally.

20

how often this procedure was used, and it was

21

interesting.

22

the -- since Rule 23(f) had been passed, but in many of

23

those cases, the parties agree, and I'll tell you why.

24

Because after class certification is denied, the

25

plaintiff decides that she does want to -- she is

The first one

We went and did research and tried to see

It -- it's used several times a year for

Official - Subject to Final Review

willing to continue litigating her individual claims.

2

She'd prefer to take an appeal, but she can't get one

3

under 23(f) so she's okay, I'm going to keep litigating,

4

and the defendants realize this plaintiff is going to

5

keep litigating.

6

any sense, as you said earlier, to litigate a 10-cent

7

claim, or as you said, Mr. Chief Justice, even a $10,000

8

claim.

9

with conditional prejudice and then we'll go up on the

And you know what?

It doesn't make

issue of class certification, which is really what this

11

case about anyway.

12

Under Microsoft's rule, it's not simple,

13

because it's a jurisdictional matter and that would be

14

prohibited.

15

That's number one.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose we have a case

16

before the district court and the only issue, disputed

17

issue, is a pure question of law and the plaintiff says,

18

I don't want to bother with asking a district judge to

19

resolve this question of law.

20

dismissal of my complaint.

21

determine the question of law is the three-judge panel

22

on the court of appeals and it skipped over the district

23

court.

24
25

So the tribunal that will

Your -- your theory would -- would cover that.
MR. STRIS:

not.

understand the allure of basically saying you shouldn't

be able to manufacture finality.

13

downsides and reasons to stick with the long settled

definition of the term.

that I mentioned.

16

There are very serious

22

particularly as a jurisdictional matter or right, here's

what's going to happen.

25

without regard to merit.

Under our rule,

If we win the appeal, the stakes are better

You heard my friend Mr. Fisher.

judges that was on the 23(f) panel was also on the

merits panel.

5

by saying there's no death-knell here.

6

a case where the plaintiffs are going to stop

litigating.

8

probably why 23(f) was denied, and so the upshot is that

9

many small dollar claims will be abandoned.

10

Microsoft responded to our 23(f) petition
This isn't a --

There's five plaintiffs' firms, that's

Now, all large claims will be litigated, but

11

that's not good either because they'll be litigated

12

without knowing the stakes, and if some of them actually

13

go to trial, we're going to have piecemeal trials.

14

I would actually suggest that rejecting the

rule of the Ninth Circuit here is more inconsistent

with this -- the --

I -- I -It's over 23(f) and go

right back --

5

MR. STRIS:

So that's true as a -- as a

6

jurisdictional matter, but not really and here's why.

7

The idea that a -- an issue can come up multiple times

8

on appeal, whether it's certification or not, that's an

9

incident of a district court not deciding -- deciding an

10

issue on fewer than all of the grounds that are

11

possible.

12

happen at any point.

13

That can happen after a trial.

That could

The -- the -- when we talk about piecemeal

14

appeals, what we're worried about is, is there an issue

15

that would have been mooted or revisited later in the

16

litigation.

17

doesn't happen in the 23(b)(3) class context --

18

I would submit that precisely that is what

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Where in the briefs can

19

I find the three splits that you didn't get to?

20

talked about the Second and the Federal Circuit.

21

in the brief can I go for the other two?

22

MR. STRIS:

You

So I don't think that the splits

23

are addressed in -- in the brief.

24

to mean this principle of conditional dismissal --

25

Where

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I took your question

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

55
1

MR. STRIS.

-- are there splits.

I -- I --

2

we didn't have occasion to -- to brief it because we

3

were kind of addressing the direct question before the

4

Court.

5

at Gabelli, if you look at Purdy, if you look at Gary

6

Plastic, that sort of the line of Second Circuit cases,

7

you'll -- you'll see the -- the strong difference of

8

opinion between the various courts.

But I -- I think if you look at -- if you look

9

Also, if you look at, I think it's footnote

10

7 of our brief, the one that refers to rulemaking, it

11

traces the history.

12

is not new.

13

makers debated as a policy matter which side of this

14

debate was right, and they couldn't come to agreement.

15

And there's six memos, Your Honor, that are cited there

16

that the reporter of the appellate Advisory Committee

17

wrote and it chronicles the circuit splits -- I know

18

this is a very exciting topic to me, but --

The -- this is an issue, this issue

For -- for seven or eight years the rule

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. STRIS:

-- it chronicles the circuit's

21

splits in a -- in a lot of detail, and -- and you can

22

see the policy arguments on both sides.

23

So I -- I suppose in conclusion, if I could

24

leave you with anything, it would be this:

25

particular issue about conditional prejudice dismissals

Alderson Reporting Company

This

Official - Subject to Final Review

56
1

and its implications not just in the class setting

2

but -- but writ large, is very complicated.

3

you can look at the -- the debate and the transfer of

4

the rules committee.

5

And, again,

It has significant implications.

At -- at the end of the day, although it may

6

feel counterintuitive, our view is that the policy

7

debate is -- the -- the status quo is on our side.

8

what I mean by that is we have a technical final

9

judgment.

And

The -- the core of Microsoft's position is

10

that practical considerations, policy arguments, I don't

11

agree with them.

12

think this is a good practice, but if you believe that

13

this isn't right for policy reasons, just as this Court

14

has expressed in the reverse situation, when you have a

15

nontechnical final judgment, but you're thinking about

16

using practical considerations to make it final through

17

the collateral order doctrine, et cetera, that that

18

should be done through rulemaking.

19

sort of change in the other direction should be done

20

through rulemaking.

I'm on the other side, people who

We submit that this

Thank you.

23

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

25

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

Alderson Reporting Company

I'd like to make

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

four points.

2

First, to address the 23(f) rule and the

3

rulemaking that led to it, I'd like to say a couple of

4

things.

5

adopted Rule 23(f) was aware of the circuit split and

6

some courts having allowed this procedure they'd like to

7

go forward with, and that's a rather remarkable

8

statement.

9

First, my friend says that the committee that

What you find if you look at that footnote

10

where that case is cited is you find the committee's

11

report saying that automatic appeals are not allowed in

12

citing Livesay, and there was a "but see" to the one

13

stray case that had gone the other way.

14

why the committee thought it was in the teeth of Livesay

15

was, of course, because Livesay held that denials of

16

class certification are inherently interlocutory, and

17

that -- imagine the plaintiff themselves talked a lot

18

about how Livesay itself played out.

19

plaintiff themselves in Livesay had gone back to

20

district court and said, now that we know from the

21

Supreme Court we're not allowed to take interlocutory

22

appeal, what we'd like to do is dismiss our claims with

23

the reservation of rights of going forward on them if we

24

prevail in the court of appeals, because otherwise it's

25

the death-knell of our case.

And the reason

Imagine if the

The district judge would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

58
1

have said that that's just the same thing.

2

course, the district judge would have been right and

3

that's exactly what the rules committee thought, and

4

I'll just read --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And, of

But that's not quite --

6

that's not quite right.

You deny 23(f) and there's a

7

choice -- or no choice.

You have to --

8

MR. FISHER:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

your individual claim.

Yeah.
-- you can go ahead with

They are betting their case.

11

MR. FISHER:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So --

If they dismiss the case

13

and they don't win on the procedural issue, that's the

14

end of the case.

15
16

You --

MR. FISHER:
Sotomayor.

But two responses, Justice

I'm sorry to interrupt.

17

Two responses.

First, remember the

18

plaintiff in Livesay, under the death-knell doctrine,

19

can take an appeal only if they represented and

20

persuaded the district court that otherwise their case

21

was over.

22

same thing.

23

thought.

24

committee notes.

25

certification may confront the plaintiff with a

So in practical terms, it's precisely the
And that's what the rules committee

And I'll just read you one sentence from the
They say:

An order denying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

situation in which the only sure path to appellate

2

review is to by -- proceeding to final judgment on the

3

merits of that individual's claim and then taking an

4

appeal.

5

So the rules committee considered this exact

6

question and thought the only way to get an appeal for

7

sure was to litigate the case ahead.

8

--

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

MR. FISHER:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

And my friend said

So how do you --

-- this is really -How do you account for

the circuit split?

13

MR. FISHER:

Well --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what -- what -- it

15

appears, and I've not studied this part of the issue

16

carefully, but that there's a lot of circuits permitting

17

these conditional appeals.

18

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

19

think there's two levels to that question you're asking

20

me.

21

class certification decisions, there's an old Second

22

Circuit decision which has been called into doubt many

23

times and never had anything done with it.

The first is, on the exact question here as to

24

And then the only other thing you have on my

25

friend's side is the Ninth Circuit case that immediately

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

60
1

preceded ours that brought this issue up to you.

2

until the Ninth Circuit allowed this a of couple years

3

ago, no court was allowing it in the class certification

4

realm.

5

So

And the important thing to understand about

6

the other split, which he calls the bigger split of

7

taking it outside the class action, is all of those

8

cases are predicated on the notion that the plaintiff's

9

claim has been destroyed on the merits.

10
11

And that's

where the Ninth Circuit made a wrong turn here.
Even if you accept that, as I think you were

12

calling, Justice Sotomayor, a more flexible rule, this

13

case cannot possibly satisfy it, because what the Ninth

14

Circuit missed is a denial of class certification has

15

zero to do with the merits.

16

that over and over and over again.

17

And this Court has said

And so the phrase my friend used that he

18

would like to have is something that just doesn't exist:

19

A right to appeal, reserving the right on a procedural

20

claim that has nothing to do with the correctness of the

21

judgment below.

22

law to that is Criminal Rule 11.

23

civil -- there's no civil counterpart.

24
25

The only counterpart that exists in the
And there's no

And so when these are complicated questions,
as my friend says they are, and perhaps in some ways, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

61
1

don't think on the facts of this case it is, but there

2

are difficult questions about appealability and the

3

like.

4

Mohawk, most recently, and going back further in Amcam

5

in the class action context, is the Rules Committee is

6

the place to resolve those questions.

7

Committee carefully considered this question and came up

8

with a solution that we simply ask the Court to be

9

faithful to today.

What the Court has said time again in Swint and

10

And the Rules

So two other points, if I have time.

First

11

of all, my friend talked a lot about Ninth Circuit

12

procedure and Ninth Circuit case law.

13

law from this Court that's relevant is the Deakins case,

14

which holds that if you dismiss a case voluntarily, it

15

does not spring back to life, that is, of course, unless

16

there's a problem with the entry of judgment that you

17

prove is lack of the ordinary appeal.

18

does not spring back to life.

19

But the only case

But otherwise, it

And that leaves him with Procter & Gamble.

20

And I think the Court is exactly right that the

21

government argued Procter & Gamble on the premise, and

22

the Court accepted the premise that the earlier order in

23

that case had caused the government to, quote, "lose on

24

the merits."

25

to revive its claims or anything like that, because that

And the government did not reserve a right

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

62
1

was not the argument the government made.

2

And so as my friend describes Procter &

3

Gamble, he might have made an argument like that might

4

have been Procter & Gamble's argument, but that was not

5

the argument that this Court accepted and the government

6

made.

7

than the Court accepted in Procter & Gamble.

8
9

They are trying to make a very different argument

And if you have any doubt about that, look
at the cases on which Procter & Gamble is based.

The

10

Thompson case, on the one hand, and what the Court

11

called the familiar rule that a plaintiff who cannot --

12

plaintiff cannot appeal after having voluntarily

13

dismissed the claims, on the other.

And what the Court

14

said is, this case is like Thompson.

This is like the

15

case where your claim is decimated on the merits.

16

so Procter & Gamble is not a problem.

17

And

And so let me leave you with one final

18

thought, which is I agree with my friend that this case

19

could have serious implications.

20

for Microsoft, all you're doing is leaving a status quo

21

in place from Livesay and Rule 23(f) and the like, but

22

their argument would apply outside of class actions to

23

any pretrial order on which the plaintiff would be

24

willing to bet their case, and that would be a very

25

serious incursion on Rule 1291 and all the case law upon
