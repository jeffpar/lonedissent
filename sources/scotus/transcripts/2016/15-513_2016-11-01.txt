and Casualty Company v. United States, ex rel. Rigsby.

Ms. Sullivan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The False Claims Act asks very little of a

12

private qui tam relator who would step into the

13

government's shoes, file under seal, serve only on the

14

government, and maintain the seal until it is lifted.

15

Respondents here violated that requirement.

16

They leaked the content and existence of

17

their suit to the Associated Press, ABC, and the New

18

York Times.

19

court of appeals, they suffered no consequence whatever

20

for that violation.

21

and hold that such bad-faith, willful, and severe

22

violations warrant dismissal under either -- any

23

appropriate test.

24
25

And yet, under this rule adopted by the

This Court should reverse or vacate

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Did you seek any sanction

of -- for the seal violations other than dismissal?

1

MS. SULLIVAN:

We did not, Your Honor.

2

sought dismissal repeatedly.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

MS. SULLIVAN:

Why not?

Your Honor, we think

5

dismissal was the appropriate sanction and that any

6

alternative sanction would be toothless here for --

7

for -- just to begin --

8
9

We

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

From -- from --

perhaps from the defendant's point of view, but I

10

thought the whole purpose of sealing the materials was

11

not to tip off the defendant.

12

the defendant would benefit from being tipped off, and

13

the government -- who I think you agree is the primary

14

concern of Congress to be protected -- the government

15

then would be left with the choice of either drop --

16

dropping the suit or expending its own resources on it.

17
18

And if that's so, then

So the one that was really penalized, in
addition to the qui tam plaintiffs, is the government.

19

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, we think that

20

Congress intended a statutory bargain that does not give

21

the government absolute discretion to decide whether the

22

seal has been violated.

23

And let me explain first what the statutory

24

bargain is.

The statutory bargain set forth in

25

3730(b)(2) is, the relator gets the litigating authority

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

of the government.

2

the government might obtain, but on condition -- on a

3

mandatory condition that it abide by the simple

4

requirements I mentioned, of keeping the -- the

5

complaint under seal.

6

It gets to see -- share in any award

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if it's a condition

7

for the government's benefit, the government can waive

8

it.

9

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, we don't agree

10

with that.

11

have said that the seal should be maintained at the

12

Attorney General's discretion.

13

said the seal's --

14

We don't -- we think that Congress could

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It did not say that; it

Well, just under

15

Justice Ginsburg's question, why -- why don't the

16

defendants have a stronger interest in having the seal

17

requirement followed than the government does?

18
19
20
21
22

MS. SULLIVAN:

Respectfully, I disagree,

Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's the point of the

question right now.
MS. SULLIVAN:

Yes, but let me go back to

23

the question.

The government does have an interest in

24

having the seal maintained.

25

amendments, it -- it's required, in order that the

The seal is, under the '86

2

it -- to intervene, and also pursue any criminal

3

investigations that might have already commenced or be

4

commenced in light of the complaint.

5

But that doesn't just protect the

6

government's discretion; it protects the operation of

7

the statute.

8

government a period of time in which it may decide to do

9

any of three things:

And the way it does that is it gives the

Intervene and conduct the qui tam

10

case, decline to intervene, or, as in happen -- as

11

happens in very many cases, settle the case with the

12

defendants before the seal is lifted.

13

Circuit said in Pilon, which we think gives the best

14

version of a discretionary test, the incentives for

15

settlement which benefits the taxpayers and the treasury

16

will often disappear if a potentially meritorious

17

complaint is filed and a defendant is willing to reach

18

a -- a -- a speedy and valuable settlement with the

19

government in order to avoid unsealing.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And as the Second

So you're arguing --

21

you're arguing the government's interests, but it -- it

22

rings a little hollow when we see that the government is

23

on the other side.

24
25

MS. SULLIVAN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

in a difficult position, arguing that we serve the

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm

1

government's interests better than the government

2

suggests.

3

important not to see this as something that is the

4

government's seal to be maintained at the government's

5

discretion.

But let me say why I think it's very

6

When Congress sets a mandatory precondition

7

to suit, this Court has always held that the requirement

8

merits dismissal -- Hallstrom is the case most clearly

9

on point -- because --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in Hallstrom --

11

Hallstrom, the plaintiff could re-file.

12

was -- it required notice.

give the notice and bring the suit again.

14

view, these plaintiffs are out irretrievably.

15

MS. SULLIVAN:

It wasn't -- it

So the plaintiff could then
But on your

Your Honor, if I make no

16

point clearer today, let me make this point clear:

17

suit does not go away on our rule; the relators go away

18

on our rule.

19

The

The government -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but that puts the

20

government to the choice of not having the relator to go

21

forward for it, and it has to either take up the reins

22

itself or say, well, we have too many other things on

23

our plate; we have to let it go.

24
25

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, the government

here is free to intervene even after the relators are

1

dismissed, no matter how late it is in the suit.

2

provision of 3730 -- the provisions of 3730 allow the

3

government to intervene for good cause later.

4

allows the government to have its late-intervened suit

5

relate back to the time of the relator's complaint.

6

there is no statute of limitations problem.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

It does, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The judgment that was

entered here would be nullified.

12

MS. SULLIVAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

13

But the same thing happened in Hallstrom.

14

considered and rejected the argument that wiping out the

15

judgment in that case would waste the resources expended

16

and --

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

MS. SULLIVAN:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

MS. SULLIVAN:

I -- please.

Hallstrom

Sorry.

Sorry, Justice Kagan.
No, please.
I just want to make the point

21

that if the government has already intervened, which it

22

didn't do in this case because three years of

23

investigations found no fraud, if the government has

24

already intervened, then Justice Ginsburg's dilemma will

25

never occur.

The government is already conducting the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

suit.

2

So the only cases we're talking about in the

3

small universe of cases that involve seal violations in

4

the first place are non-intervened cases in which the

5

government might not have intervened but want to do so

6

later.

7

government or the treasury, because the government can

8

come in later, relate back, and re-conduct the suit if

9

it finds it's a meritorious case.

And my point is there is no prejudice to the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

the briefs.

15

language.

16

unless a condition is met.

17

You mentioned Hallstrom a

Yes, Your Honor.
-- and rely on it heavily in

But Hallstrom has very different statutory
Hallstrom says no action may be commenced

And, similarly, in 3730, the statute uses

18

language that makes it clear that dismissal is

19

appropriate when a mandatory requirement is not met.

20

says, "the Court shall dismiss an action or claim."

21

says, "in no event may a person bring an action."

22

says the court -- "no court shall have jurisdiction."

23

All of that way of -- all of those phrasings indicate

24

what happens when a requirement isn't satisfied.

25

It
It

It

But there is no such language with respect

Official - Subject to Final Review

10

to this requirement.

2

requirement, but it doesn't say what happens if the

3

requirement isn't satisfied.

4

different from Hallstrom and from the other language in

5

Section 3730.

6

I mean, it's a mandatory

MS. SULLIVAN:

And that makes it very

That is correct, Your Honor.

7

We do not have an express statement of what the remedial

8

sanction is for a violation of the seal.

9

silent, too, on the remedial sanction for a violation of

But RCRA was

10

the pre-filing notice requirement, and yet this Court

11

nonetheless held the mandatory precondition not being

12

met, dismissal was the appropriate sanction, and also

13

stated expressly that the requirement was not

14

jurisdictional.

15

So, Your Honor, Hallstrom really was the

16

same exact case, functionally, as our case.

17

difference --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Here's the

But what about the point

19

that I made before with respect to Hallstrom?

20

didn't put the plaintiffs out of court.

21

have to give the required notice.

22

notice to the government, the alleged violator.

23

thought the purpose of that was to give the violator a

24

chance to clean things up so there wouldn't be any suit.

25

So those plaintiffs, if I understand Hallstrom right,

Alderson Reporting Company

Hallstrom

It said they

They have to give the
And I

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

just give the notice, wait the necessary number of days,

2

and go forward with their suit again.

3

MS. SULLIVAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And as I

4

said before, the government can come in under 3730(c)(3)

5

and have its complaint relate back to the relator.

6

it's similar to the plaintiffs in Hallstrom.

So

7

But to answer Justice Kagan's question, the

8

only difference between our case and the Hallstrom-type

9

pre-filing waiting period comes from the peculiarities

10

of the qui tam statute, and in particular from the

11

peculiarities of the qui tam statute that benefit

12

relators.

13

And what I mean by that is, what was the

14

1986 bargain?

15

come forward, and so it said, we're going to give you

16

new, larger bounties and financial incentives.

17

we're worried that if we encourage you to come forward,

18

you might impair government investigations.

19

worry if we make you wait first before you file, you

20

might lose your right to sue.

21

relator beat you to the post and file first, or the

22

government might file and then you'd be out of luck.

23

Congress wanted to encourage relators to

But

But we

You might have some other

So in order to protect the relators, the qui

24

tam statute does it backwards from Hallstrom.

25

file -- sorry -- file first, wait second.

Alderson Reporting Company

It says

Whereas in

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

Hallstrom, it accomplished the exact same purpose under

2

RCRA:

3

protect relators that this statute, the '86 amendments

4

to the qui tam statute, say relator file first, but keep

5

it under seal to protect the government's right of first

6

refusal.

Wait first, file second.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

It was in order to

Well, you have two

8

arguments:

One is that dismissal is mandatory; the

9

other is that the district court and the court of

10

appeals applied the wrong standard in determining not to

11

dismiss here.

12

As to the first, what would you say about

13

the case where the disclosure is very limited, seen by

14

only one person, let's say; it was inadvertent, it was

15

not done in bad faith, and it causes no harm?

16

say dismissal is required even under those

17

circumstances?

18

MS. SULLIVAN:

You would

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

19

We think that dismissal is required where a disclosure

20

rises to the level of a violation.

21

courts in per se dismissal jurisdictions have held -- we

22

cite the Omnicare-Gale case that's in the Sixth Circuit,

23

which follows a per se dismissal rule -- the Court found

24

that a mere private disclosure to a spouse may not -- a

25

trivial disclosure may not rise to the level of a

Alderson Reporting Company

But as some district

Official - Subject to Final Review

13

violation.

And, Your Honor, we think that the district

2

courts can find safety valves in a per se dismissal rule

3

by finding that such trivial disclosures don't rise to

4

the level of --

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

question.

But that doesn't -Well, that's not this

I had the same question.
JUSTICE ALITO:

That doesn't sound like a

per se rule, then.
MS. SULLIVAN:

A per se rule with de minimis

11

exceptions, Your Honor.

But under our alternative

12

argument -- and, Justice Breyer, I definitely want to

13

get to your question.

14

Well, so let me try -- let me just answer --

15

finish the answer by saying, we argue in the alternative

16

that if there's going to be a discretionary standard

17

akin to equitable discretion, then bad faith should be

18

the primary factor and harm should be measured by --

19

sorry -- the severity of the violation should be

20

measured by what the relator did or the relator's

21

counsel did at the time of the disclosure, not the

22

consequences; its character, not its consequences;

23

ex-ante, not ex-post.

24

government should not be a requirement.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that actual harm to the

Once you're there -- I

range of violations.

5

dismiss the case?

6

Vast

Some don't hurt really at all.
Some are certainly not bad
Really, why

And once you begin to agree with that,

7

you're into argument 2.

8

2, what do you think of the Lujan factors?

And once you're into argument

Your Honor, we don't think

that the Lujan factors were properly articulated or

13

dispositive one, and there is no question that the

7

imputed to the relators.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
whether they knew it or not.

10
11
12
13
14

But on the question of

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, we think that

no -JUSTICE BREYER:

Why did you never ask them

or the lawyer?
MS. SULLIVAN:

Well, Your Honor, we did ask

15

them whether they authorized the conduct.

16

So there's no --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

They said no.

So here we have ambiguity

18

as respect to that.

Could I write an opinion that said

19

the Lujan factors are some factors?

20

complicated.

21

factors affect the basic fairness of the situation,

22

which is something that judges should look to as well.

24

the Supreme -- upon the district court to make a fair

25

decision in say -- in terms of sanction, in light of the

2

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, in this case, it

3

was an abuse of discretion not to dismiss on the

4

underlying facts.

5
6

JUSTICE BREYER:
this case; you do.

7

MS. SULLIVAN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

I don't have to worry about

You are correct.
And I -- I have to worry

about the right standard to write an opinion.

10

MS. SULLIVAN:

Correct, Your Honor.

11

And let me suggest, respectfully, why you

12

should, at a minimum, vacate and remand for resolution

13

of any remaining fact questions about imputation or the

14

like, and that is because the articulation of the

15

standard by Lujan, the court below, and courts following

16

this toothless test basically have invited open season

17

on deliberate, bad-faith leaks to the press.

18

If you affirm and say this was good enough

19

for abuse of discretion, then further -- Mr. Chief

20

Justice?

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I was just going to

22

ask:

I thought your very -- the very first question was

23

that you didn't -- that your answer was that you didn't

24

seek any sanction other than dismissal.

25

quite sure your fallback argument is before us.

Alderson Reporting Company

So I'm not

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

MS. SULLIVAN:

It is, Your Honor, because

2

dismissal should have been granted under a proper

3

discretionary test, if you reject our per se rule.

4

we think with respect --

5
6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

And

Did you ask

for the application of any rule other than dismissal?

7

MS. SULLIVAN:

We -- we asked for dismissal.

8

And we asked for dismissal urging, at a minimum, a test

9

that would take bad faith into account.

If -- the most

10

important feature of the decision below is it gave the

11

back of its hand to deliberate, bad faith conduct.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if we go back --

13

and I haven't done this -- and look at the way the case

14

was litigated, is there an argument from you that says,

15

okay, if you're not going to automatically dismiss this

16

case as we argue, you should do this as a second

17

alternative.

18

MS. SULLIVAN:

Yes, there is, Your Honor.

19

We preserved at every stage the argument that if there

20

is no per se dismissal, there should be dismissal based

21

on a proper balancing test.

22

test should, number one, make bad faith primary.

Second, Your Honor, there may be other cases

unlike this one in which it's a harder case, in which

maybe someone just talked about fraud in the air.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I thought the

18

question was suppose these plaintiffs didn't reveal the

19

complaint at all, but they described on a radio show, on

20

a TV show, what they understood to be State Farm's

21

practice.

22

they had filed the complaint.

23

So the information came out, but not that

The harm here that you're talking about could have been

10

12

How, then, do you answer

Let's assume there is a First Amendment
protection.

How then would you answer the question?
MS. SULLIVAN:

Then, Your Honor, if fraud

13

was discussed without revealing the existence and

14

content of the complaint itself, then there would not be

15

a violation and the per se rule would apply, which is

16

why our per se rule is narrower and less absolute than

17

-- than my friends on the other side have portrayed it.

18

But Your Honor, there may be times when a

19

revelation of fraud and not the words "here is our False

20

Claims Act complaint," which was the case in this

21

record, in which the revelation of the fraud was the

22

functional equivalent of revealing the complaint.

23

If a lawyer goes up on the courthouse steps,

24

comes out on the courthouse steps and talks about fraud

25

and then points to his briefcase and says, well, I

can't, if somebody says, well, did you file a complaint,

2

no, I can't talk about, there might be instances in

3

which the exercise of First Amendment rights becomes the

4

functional equivalent of fraud, and the district courts

5

can work that out in deciding whether a disclosure rises

6

to the level of a violation.

7

But you don't have to face that here.

What

8

you need to face here is a case where lawyers violating

9

every possible obligation under the statute, as well as

10

their ethical obligations, and whose conduct should be

11

imputed to the relators, as the Fifth Circuit assumed,

12

leaked the actual complaint in its legal content to

three national news media.

18

that was not likely to cause any harm, and in fact did

not cause any harm, and the government comes in to the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

mean for bad -- why do you say -- is it -- how is it

court took it into account?

7

Why isn't it just something that a

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, we don't think

8

the district court or the court of appeals did take bad

9

faith into account.

And if you look at the government's

10

brief at page 28, you'll see that the United States

11

didn't seem to take bad faith seriously here either.

12

That is an -- is an error that -- as a matter of law in

13

the application of the balancing test, and we think bad

14

faith plus severe harm makes an easy case for dismissal

15

here.

16
17

Let me see why the severe harm should be
assessed differently less than the Fifth Circuit here.

18

The Fifth Circuit here took an ex-post

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but it did both.

When

-- when one factor is the seriousness of the violation,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

presumably one measures the seriousness of the violation

2

by asking whether the violation is likely to cause harm

3

ex-ante.

4

So it's really looking to both.

It's

5

calling them different things, but it's saying, we're

6

going to check out the seriousness of the violation,

7

whether it's likely to produce harm, what the risk of

8

harm is, and we're going to ask in ways we ask in the

9

law all the time, did it in fact cause that harm?

10

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, we don't tend to

11

let drug dealers off if the thing they think is

12

marijuana that they are selling turns out to be oregano.

13

We do care about state of mind at the time, and we don't

14

just look to the accident or happenstance that it didn't

15

cause harm in fact.

16

Here, the courts, by looking to the

17

consequences, failed to describe as severe -- and the

18

government actually calls this a minor violation -- to

19

leak the contents of the complaint to national news

20

media.

21

counsel, leak away with no consequence.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TEJINDER SINGH

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

21
22
23

MR. SINGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is, as the first

24

half-hour illustrates, not really whether the courts

25

will punish and deter violations of the False Claims Act

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

seal requirement, but whether they will do so in a way

2

that is counterproductive to the government's interest,

3

or whether they will instead impose other sanctions that

4

would benefit the government, allow cases to go forward,

5

and simultaneously create an effective deterrent.

6

The message that you're hearing from State

7

Farm is that no other sanction will be effective; but

8

the rule will be toothless, it will be open season, but

9

history belies this claim.

Since 1986, when the False

10

Claims Act amendments were enacted, there have been

11

10,593 qui tam actions filed.

13

cases that they found that talk about the seal.

involved seal violations.

16

17

bad faith.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if we issue an

2

opinion -- when we issue an opinion in this case, it

3

will change the legal landscape.

4

And I would appreciate it if you would

5

respond to one of the arguments Ms. Sullivan made toward

6

the end, which is that if we issue an opinion that

7

affirms in this case where there were -- which involves

8

the type -- the greatest degree of bad faith in this --

9

in violating the seal requirement that is really

10

possible to imagine, that will stand for the principal

11

in future cases, that even if an instance in which there

12

was complete bad faith, dismissal is not appropriate.

13

Or a dismissal is -- can -- can properly be rejected.

14

MR. SINGH:

Sure.

So there are -- there are

15

two ways I'd like to answer the question.

You know,

16

first I want to answer just directly on its own terms,

17

and then I do have some questions -- issues about the

18

premise.

19

You know, directly on its own terms, I think

20

it would be very easy for you to write an opinion to say

21

nothing in this opinion condones what Mr. Scruggs did in

22

this case.

23

appropriate for him to have been referred to bar

24

counsel, for him to have been disqualified as the

25

relators' attorney, for a substantial monetary sanction

We think it would have been entirely

to be levied against him.

2

factual findings, right?

3

hypothesizing.

4

findings that are not clearly erroneous, but the

5

relators themselves were not culpable, did not know

6

about these actions.

7
8

In this case, there are
It's not just us

There's no ambiguity on this.

Factual

And the ordinary rule in cases where a
lawyer engages -- I'm sorry.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you have, just on the

10

top of your head somewhere -- I -- I because I want to

11

read this.

12

MR. SINGH:

Petition Appendix 67A is where

13

you'll find the district court's finding on this, I

14

believe.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. SINGH:

17

You know, that the relators did

not know, and then that was affirmed on appeal.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20
21

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

But parties are usually held

accountable for the actions of their attorneys.
MR. SINGH:

To be sure, they are,

22

ordinarily, when the attorney is acting within the scope

23

of representation.

24

doesn't show up to a hearing, if an attorney files or

25

doesn't file a document on the client's behalf, the

So if an attorney shows up and --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

client has to live with what's in those documents or

2

with that nonappearance.

3

this sort of extrajudicial chicanery, you know, without

4

their client's knowledge, the ordinary rule is you don't

5

dismiss a case with prejudice.

6

majority of circuits, and this Court really hasn't

7

gotten into that.

8

rule, and that makes sense.

9

But when attorneys engage in

That's true in the vast

But that -- that is the ordinary

And that condition is heightened, here,

10

right?

Because as -- as the statute makes clear, as

11

Congress made clear in 1986, the government is also an

12

interested party in this case, and an innocent one that

13

will suffer if dismissal is done.

14

check, you know, the potential that it will be open

season with some well works -- well-worded and

16

strongly-worded dictum in this opinion, no problem.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I think you can

You see, I -- I think this

18

is going to protect the government's investigations.

19

But the consequence of this is that there is a document

So it is a serious thing when

Well, it's not just the

And that's what poses the problem.

It's the

And your

10

opponent here is saying when you get to the bottom of

11

it, given the seriousness of what went on, this is too

12

light a sanction.

13
14

At least that's how I'm seeing it.

And I would appreciate your comments on
that.

15

MR. SINGH:

Absolutely.

So, you know, we

16

don't diminish the seriousness of seal violations at

17

all.

18

Breyer, really illustrate that what we are talking about

19

here is a regime where district courts, for ages, have

20

applied discretionary inherent powers-type rules or

21

administrated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and

22

come up with case-specific appropriate circumstances --

23

appropriate sanctions based on the circumstances of each

24

case, which is exactly what the district court did in

25

this case.

But I think all the examples you gave, Justice

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

The district court was not blind to

2

Mr. Scruggs' bad faith.

3

completely, but understood that there were intervening

4

facts here.

5

Took it into account

And, you know, I think also, as we talk

6

about how to proceed forward with this case, you know,

7

it's worth just pausing for a moment on -- on what's

8

happened since, you know.

9
10

This case now --

JUSTICE BREYER:

And before you -- I want to

get a thorough answer of this because --

11

MR. SINGH:

Sure.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- however this case got

13

here, it's here.

14

that's most favorable, I can read to you.

15

your opponent as saying, look, say something and do

16

something, like remand it, that realize -- that makes

17

people realize this is a very serious thing.

18

course, I think you are right in saying this is the kind

19

of thing that district courts do as part of their job,

20

weighing various factors.

21

add to say to me, no, he was not overly lenient here?

22

And so viewed in your legal framework

MR. SINGH:

I can read

Though, of

But what would you want to

Sure.

So -- so let me actually

23

go back to what would have been the second half of my

24

answer to Justice Alito.

25

premise that this was consummate bad-faith conduct.

There are some issues with the

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

think in 1986 Congress made it clear that what it was

2

trying to do is stop defendants from being tipped off

3

about False Claims Act lawsuits.

4

Consummate bad faith conduct would be a relator's lawyer

5

reaching out to the defendant.

6

That was the goal.

Here, what Scruggs did was a little bit

7

different.

Although he sent the evidentiary disclosure

8

to the press, he sent it as background for their pieces.

9

He informed them that it was under seal, and that's a

10

characterization that State Farm has used, the

11

background characterization, page 8 of their brief, and

12

in all their briefs below.

13

And so I think he was intimating to the

14

folks he sent it to that it was not for further

15

disclosure.

16

Now, those folks happened to be journalists,

17

and State Farm from this reads, oh, isn't it so bad

18

because journalists have a very large platform?

19

But journalists also have ethics, and the ethical rules

20

of journalism wouldn't allow them to quote or attribute

21

material that's given to them as background.

22

think there is a real sense in which the disclosures

23

here were not intended to, you know, achieve the

24

objectives that Congress was trying to prohibit in the

25

seal requirement.

Yes.

And so I

So in that sense, I think this is not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

the archetypical bad-faith conduct that Congress was

2

talking about.

3

Now, I am sensitive to your point about what

4

about defendants' reputations.

We don't think Congress

5

cared about that in 1986, but even if it did, you

6

know -- and of course, that is important in cases

7

involving trade secrets and other kinds of seal orders.

8

You know, the right remedy in all of those cases is

9

damages to the defendant, right?

It's not allow the

10

defendant to get away with fraud against the government,

11

and so that's why I started this part of the argument by

12

saying, you know, the question is really not do we deter

13

and punish; it's how.

14

that makes sense or are we going to do it in a way that

15

is counterproductive?

Are we going to do it in a way

16

Now, State Farm is upset because there is

17

really not a great way to punish Mr. Scruggs anymore.

18

He's been disbarred.

19

he is no longer a part of the case.

20

Mr. Scruggs has not been part of this case for 3,148

21

days.

22

He went to jail for a while, and
In fact,

That's how long ago he withdrew.
In the intervening periods, we have had

23

mountains of discovery, dozens of depositions, a jury

24

trial showing that State Farm defrauded the government,

25

a verdict affirmed on appeal, and now we are here.

Alderson Reporting Company

And,

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

you know, a lot of water has gone under the bridge since

2

then, and so, you know, to the extent, Justice Breyer,

3

that what you're really asking is what can we do about

4

this particular case, I think we ought to take that into

5

account, too.

6

You know, there has been no misconduct now

7

and no one accused of misconduct in this case for more

8

than 3,000 days, and State Farm, in the interim, has

9

been proven guilty.

10

Now, State Farm says consider it all

11

ex-ante, right, just ignore all of that, but that's not

12

really, I think, the proper application of a

13

discretionary test.

14

to apply discretion in a particular case, I think we can

15

be sensitive to reality.

16

blind ourselves to what's happening, and I think that's

17

the way that courts have always conducted these

18

inquiries.

You know, when you think about how

You know, we don't have to

19

The last thing that I want to -- I want to

20

point out, and then, you know, if there are no further

21

questions I'll rest, is that, you know, State Farm says

22

that the statute asks very little of relators.

23

just patently false.

24
25

That is

careers.

3

They blew the whistle.

They lost their

They lost their jobs.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think that it

4

honestly asks very little of them when it comes to the

5

seal requirement.

Just don't disclose it.

6

MR. SINGH:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8
9

So -That's not asking a

lot.
MR. SINGH:

So State Farm's position on this

10

has morphed a little bit over time.

11

they -- they were arguing that the disclosure of the

12

allegations or the substance of the fraud is itself, you

13

know, a violation of the seal.

14

they kept that in footnote 10 of their opening brief.

15

Now they have sort of pared it back, and I think now

16

finally it's clear that they are not taking that

17

position, and I think that that's true.

18

In the lower courts

Now, they've come to --

I think also, though, the fact that it's

19

very easy to comply with the seal takes a lot of wind

20

out of the sails of their deterrence argument, right?

21

As they understand the seal now, Mr. Scruggs or any

22

attorney can avoid violating the seal by, like, editing

23

the document for 20 minutes.

24

disclosure that he sent to journalists, very easy to

25

just include the allegations and strip out the details

Right?

Alderson Reporting Company

The evidentiary

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1
2

that reveal the existence of the lawsuit.
And so you don't need a particularly -- and,

3

you know, he doesn't get a lot of benefit in this case

4

out of disclosing the allegations -- the existence of

5

the lawsuit, because, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out,

6

the harm to the reputation, if your goal is to tar and

7

feather the defendant in the press, the way you do is by

8

disclosing the committed fraud, which --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

But I mean,

10

if -- if Mr. Scruggs stands on the courthouse steps and

11

discloses the underlying facts, I think people can put

12

two and two together and realize that he just might be

13

filing a lawsuit.

14

MR. SINGH:

I think that's possible, Your

15

Honor, and so, you know, that gets back to the question

16

of what is and isn't a violation.

17

I don't understand them to be taking that

18

position in this case, and those kind of closed-case

19

situations, you know, they aren't really before you.

20

And, you know, as the summary of the history of False

21

Claims Act seal violations tells you, that kind of stuff

22

really is not happening.

23

Right?

I think that we are talking about a handful

24

of cases, less than .3 percent of all False Claims Act

25

cases have ever involved an arguable seal violation, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

a vanishingly small fraction of those involve

2

allegations of bad faith, right?

3

To the extent that State Farm wants you to

4

adopt either a blanket rule of dismissal or even a rule

5

that is geared toward dismissal through application of

6

discretionary factors, you -- they are really trying to

7

throw the baby out with the bath water here.

8

you know, a dramatic overreaction, especially when, you

9

know, as here, the government, whose interests are

It is a --

10

principally affected, is telling you that you don't need

11

to do that.

12

If there are no further questions --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what do you make of

14

the -- how much weight do you think should be given to

15

the fact that the government doesn't think that

16

dismissal is appropriate in this situation?

17

What -- what -- does the statute say that

18

the complaint shall be filed under seal and shall be

19

main -- maintained under seal unless the government

20

waives that?

21

MR. SINGH:

-- not exactly.

So for the

22

first 60 days, the government definitely can't waive the

23

seal.

24

government's motion, so there is a certain amount of

25

discretion involved on whether the seal will continue.

The seal can only be extended past 60 days of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

We think it kind of makes sense to afford

2

the government more weight after that 60-day period.

3

Here, the first seal violation didn't happen until day

4

103, and so, you know, we are kind of in that zone.

5

I think the government's -- should -- say should account

6

for a lot, especially in this case.

7

So

As a general proposition, you know, we are

8

not urging like blind deference to the government or

9

deference on the issue of statutory interpretation, but

10

we are saying it's very clear that Congress is

11

principally concerned with protecting the government.

12

And when the government tells you -- and, yeah, there

13

will always be a balance here, right?

14

interest may have been harmed by a seal violation, but

15

they weren't in this case.

16

The government's

By the way, that's an important point.

You

17

know, there is a finding about that.

And those are the types of interest that

Congress was trying to deal with in 1986, because in

1986 it was clear that there was a tidal wave of fraud

against the government, more than the government could

relators were marshaled as force multipliers to help

with that effort.

government steps in and says, dismiss this case, because

they have already intervened or some other innocent

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

2
3

MR. BASH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

Given the focus of the earlier portion of

5

the argument, I will -- I'm happy to answer questions

6

about why the automatic dismissal rule is wrong, but I

7

will jump right to what we think the standard should be,

8

how we think the Court ought to write the opinion, and

9

then how we think the Court ought to dispose of this

10

case.

11

We think the standard for how to remedy a

12

seal violation incorporates the basic background

13

flexibility that district courts have always had to

14

remedy violations of protective orders and sealing

15

orders as informed by the basic purpose of this

16

provision, which I think, as everyone has acknowledged

17

now, is to protect the government by making sure that

18

potential targets of criminal and civil investigations

19

are not tipped off.

20

And the reason you need that in the FCA is

21

because the filing of the complaint does something very

22

special.

23

in and say whether it's going to intervene.

24
25

It triggers the duty of the government to come

So that's why, Justice Sotomayor, it's not
the factual allegations of fraud.

Alderson Reporting Company

It's actually the

Official - Subject to Final Review

filing of the complaint because that is what triggers a

2

duty on behalf of the government to investigate and then

3

tell the Court whether it's going to intervene.

5

As far as the standard in the way this
Court --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

the government need that latitude?

8
9

And -- and -- and why does

MR. BASH:

It needs that latitude because

defendants could potentially take steps to stymie an

10

investigation if they know that there's an actual

11

government attorney looking at this right now because

12

they have to look at it under the statute.

13

think, Congress's thinking in 1986, and I don't even

14

really take Petitioner to disagree with that at this

15

point.

16
17

That was, I

In -- in terms of how to write the
opinion --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -- well, let's get to

19

that, okay, because do we look at the situation as it

20

existed at the time of the violation and the risk it

21

created?

22

it didn't, in fact, happen, so there is no harm?

23

Shouldn't the severity be determined at the time it

24

occurred?

25

Or do we look at it ex post facto and decide

Giving a complaint to a news media is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

probably the best way to tip off a defendant.

2

actually more likely to do it than failing to serve the

3

government on time for which many circuits automatically

4

dismiss the complaint, even though that could be

5

considered harmless if the government is served late and

6

comes in and asks for an extension.

7

MR. BASH:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

It's

Well, let me take -There is a disparity on

how courts are treating those situations, but that's not
necessarily at issue here.

11

But what is at issue is, what do we measure

12

the appropriate sanction to be and based on what

13

evaluation?

14

MR. BASH:

Well, let me take the general

15

question and bring it to the facts here, and then talk

16

about that question of the disparity about how courts

17

are treating the different kinds of violations.

18

The answer on the general question is they

19

are both relevant.

Under the standard articulated below

20

and the standard we've advocated, you look at both the

21

actual harm to the government, just like often attempt

22

crimes are not punished as strongly as crimes that

23

actually result in harm, but you also look at the

24

severity of the violation, and we think there's a direct

25

correlation between the severity and the potential harm.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

If you actually give the complaint to the defendant, the

2

harm -- the potential harm is enormous.

3

person who is not affiliated with the defendant, the

4

potential harm is less.

5

And, of course, there is intent and bad faith.

6

If you tell one

So it's relevant in that way.

And we don't discount that other factors

could be relevant in idiosyncratic cases.

10

It's true --

Now, that may or may not hurt some.

It may

hurt some a lot.

Now, can that be taken into account?

24

I would say in an appropriate case, absolutely.

The

2

it.

3

What do you think of that?

4

MR. BASH:

I didn't disagree with anything

5

you said.

I think the Court could take that into

account.

It couldn't have made a difference here

7

because those three journalists did not leak the suit to

So the -- State Farm couldn't have read

And what we think -- while these violations

11

were certainly in bad faith, what we think mitigates it

12

and at least makes the district court -- means that the

it doesn't appear -- as Mr. Singh was saying earlier, it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When would the government

be hurt by a sealing violation?
MR. BASH:

I think what Congress had in mind

6

is defendants taking steps to thwart the government

7

investigation; for example, destroying evidence,

8

declining to cooperate once they know that there is a

9

formal investigation of them.

10
11

I think that's what

Congress had in mind.
I'll note, though, that the Senate Report,

12

for those who look at that kind of thing, said that they

13

expected -- that the Senate expected that there would

14

not be many instances where a seal violation would harm

15

the government.

16

this hasn't happened often.

17

So I don't think it's surprising that

to the seal requirement.

I think they said they relate

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In your brief, you did

say -- on page 27 of your brief, you said that

determining a sanction for seal violation.

2

MR. BASH:

That's right, Justice Ginsburg,

3

in an idiosyncratic case.

And the reason I say

4

idiosyncratic is, as we discussed, lower courts have

5

held and we agree that merely disclosing the allegations

6

of fraud does not violate the seal.

7

reputational harm you'd be talking about is the

8

incremental harm from the disclosure that a suit has

9

been filed.

So the sort of

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

how to write the ideal platonic opinion?

MR. BASH:

You were going to tell us

I wouldn't presume to say the

platonic opinion.

14

recommendation in how to write the opinion, we think

15

that the overall focus should be courts should remedy

16

these seal orders like they always remedy protective

17

orders and seal orders, with a healthy dose of

18

discretion, but, in light of the purpose of this

19

provision, to protect the government.

20

But to the extent the Court seeks our

More specifically, the three factors

21

identified by the courts below:

actual harm to the

22

government; severity of the violation, which I think

23

correlates with potential harm; and intent or bad faith

24

are the three key factors in a mine run case.

25

don't think the Court should exclude that in an

But we

2

factors could be relevant.

3

Defendant's reputation or other

We also think -- Justice Alito, I think this

4

responds to your questions about making sure to send a

5

strong message that these violations will not be

6

tolerated.

We think the Court could have dismissed this

7

case here.

We don't say that it would have been an

8

abuse of discretion to dismiss the case here.

9

think if the Court's worried about sending the signal

And I

10

that intentional violations don't matter, it could say

11

the district court would have been perfectly within its

12

discretion to dismiss here.

13

additional sanctions, the Court would have been in its

14

discretion to refer counsel to the bar or to impose

15

other sanctions, but they didn't seek that here.

If State Farm had sought

think, should be particularly robust in this context

because the government relies on the relator.

20

There is a trial of however many days, as Mr. Singh

21

think it shows why the abuse of discretion standard

Do you think deference ought

parts of the test?

MR. BASH:

And if so, as to what

Well, what we say in the brief is

5

deference ought to be given to the government's

statement that it's been harmed.

7

"substantial weight," and we're not weighted to that

8

phraseology.

9

yes or no on harm, we think that should be given

So we use the phrase

But if the government comes in and says

deferential --

MR. BASH:

Yeah.

On actual harm?
Well, we didn't come in

dismissed.

15

as I said, that the Court would have been within its

discretion to dismiss this case.

On the issue of harm to the

government, did I understand you to say that the

question is actual harm and not likelihood of harm at

MR. BASH:

We think on that factor, it's

21

actual harm, but we think the second factor, severity,

correlates with potential harm.

24

there is enormous.

violation might cause harm?

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

When you write the opinion

that actual harm to the government is not a requirement

Alderson Reporting Company

And let me just remind you, in answer to

2

your question, Justice Ginsburg, when will the

3

government concede actual harm, it's not dispositive.

4

It's dispositive if the government says there's actual

5

harm, yes, or heavily weighted and possibly dispositive

6

if they say it.

7

But to remind you, as we point out on

page 20 of our reply brief, the government hasn't

admitted it was actually harmed, except in one case, the

10

Le Blanc-ITT case, in 30 years.

11

require actual harm.

12

potential harm, which is important, is captured by the

13

severity factor, but that the lower courts misapplied

14

the severity factor by looking to what risk transpired

15

rather than what risk occurred at the time of the

16

disclosure.

17

So you should not

We agree with the government that

As to whether that was a serious risk, I

18

must respectfully disagree that there was no possible

Farm wasn't tipped off at all.

22

look for yourself and see State Farm's lawyers saying, I

Mr. Singh

We heard

So there was a potential for tip-off here.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

And as to whether there was harm to the

2

judicial system, as Justice Breyer pointed out, in

3

addition to harm to the government, this is a case where

4

a Gulfport jury found fraud against an insurer in the

5

wake of horrible losses from Hurricane Katrina, but the

6

government, whose delegated power the relators are

7

seeking to assert, found after three years of copious

8

investigation -- you can look for yourself on JA214 --

9

the government found that there -- in the words of the

10

Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security

11

at JA14, we find no indication that wind damage was

12

attributed to flooding, or that flood insurance paid for

13

wind damages.

14

If you're concerned nonetheless about any

15

windfall to the defendants, it won't happen, because the

16

government can come in and pick this case and relate the

17

complaint back to the time of the relator's filing

18

And finally, as to the Rigsbys involvement,

19

if you have any factual questions about imputation, of

20

course that can be handled on remand for the application

21

of a proper test that makes willfulness primary,

22

severity assessed, ex-anti not ex-post, and that does

23

consider, as the government conceded it should, the

24

defendant's reputational harm.

25

that on page 27, and you should adopt that in your test

The government concedes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

as the Second Circuit did in Pilon.

2

But as to the Rigsbys' involvement, first we

3

think, as a matter of law, there should be imputation

4

for lawyers' conduct to their clients in most cases, but

5

certainly in qui tam cases where the relators cannot

6

represent themselves pro se.

7

No one can represent the government; that --

8

you can't be a pro se lawyer representing the

9

government.

10

The lower courts are clear.

You must have

a lawyer.

11

Hallstrom said a trained lawyer who made an

12

inadvertent mistake still bound his client to the

13

failure of the pre-filing notice requirement.

14

And we think imputation here is easy as a

15

matter of law, but if you think it's a question of fact,

16

then if you look to Mr. Singh's cite to Justice Breyer

17

to Petition Appendix 67A, it's actually Petition

18

Appendix 68A where you'll find the key evidence about

19

the relator's relationship to Scruggs.

20

that page to you because it did not find them not

21

culpable.

22

And I commend

At 68A of the Petition Appendix, it didn't

23

find the relators not culpable; it found them to have

24

not approved, authorized, or initiated the disclosures.

25

That's not the same as not being intimately involved

Alderson Reporting Company

2

And I refer you to the district court's

3

clients, but this time Scruggs paid the Rigsbys to be

their material witnesses, their employees, their joint

venturers.

9

I don't know many lawyers who pay their

You can look either to the Northern District

10

of Alabama docket where Judge Acker found them

13

in this docket where he finds that the relationship was

a sham.

15

and abuse of discretion not to find imputation here.
