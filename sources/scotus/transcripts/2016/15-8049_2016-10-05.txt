ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA A. SWARNS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. SWARNS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Duane Buck was condemned to death after his

11

own court appointed trial attorneys knowingly introduced

12

an expert opinion that he was more likely to commit

13

criminal acts of violence in the future because he is

14

black.

15

make its critical future dangerousness decision which

16

was a prerequisite for a death sentence and the central

17

disputed issue at sentencing based not on the individual

18

facts and circumstances of Mr. Buck's crime or his life

19

history, but instead based on a false and pernicious

20

group-based stereotype.

21

This evidence encouraged the sentencing jury to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Didn't that expert say, I

22

don't think he's a future -- I don't think he's going to

23

be a future danger?

24
25

MS. SWARNS:

On cross-examination

Dr. Quijano testified that he did believe that Mr. Buck

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

was likely to commit future crimes of violence.

2

that -- at the prosecutor's questioning that Mr. Buck

3

was on the low end of the continuum, but that he could

4

not say that Mr. Buck was not likely to commit criminal

5

acts of violence.

6
7
8
9
10

He said

But Mr. Buck was, unquestionable --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But more likely than not

that he wouldn't.
MS. SWARNS:

Yes.

He was on the low end of

the spectrum in terms of the risk of violence.
But here this expert's evidence not only

11

prejudiced Mr. Buck at sentencing, it also put the very

12

integrity of the courts in jeopardy.

13

Texas acknowledged that its ordinary interest and

14

finality does not apply.

15

would waive its procedural defenses and allow new

16

sentencing hearings in six capital cases, including

17

Mr. Buck's, that involved the same expert's race as

18

criminal violence opinion.

19

cases and then reversed course in Mr. Buck's case alone.

20

For that reason,

It publicly declared that it

Texas conceded error in five

As a result, Mr. Buck is the only Texas

21

prisoner to face execution pursuant to a death sentence

22

that Texas itself has acknowledged is compromised by

23

racial bias that undermines confidence in the criminal

24

justice system.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

There's a tension in

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

your -- your briefing over what you're really arguing

2

for.

3

Circuit standard for a COA in saying they're imposing an

4

improper and unduly burdensome.

5

briefing, and as you sort of begun today, is really

6

focused on the underlying merits of the case.

7

sort of have to make a choice, don't you, because if we

8

didn't focus on the merits and rule in your favor, we

9

don't get to say too much about the threshold for

In the question presented, you focus on the Fifth

But most of the

And you

10

Certificate of Appealability.

11

Certificate of Appealability, all we're saying on the

12

merits is there's a substantial showing.

13

want us to do, on the merits or on the Certificate of

14

Appealability?

15

MS. SWARNS:

Well, if we focus on the

So what do you

Well, in order to determine

16

whether Mr. Buck was expired -- was entitled to a

17

Certificate of Appealability, this Court and the Fifth

18

Circuit was required to determine whether or not the

19

district court decision with respect to both the

20

constitutional question and the procedural question

21

would be debatable among jurors.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

Right.

So

23

is that what you want us to say, that because the merits

24

are debatable, he should have gotten a Certificate of

25

Appealability?

Or do you want us to say, well, he

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

should have won, and so he obviously should have gotten

2

a Certificate of Appealability?

3

MS. SWARNS:

We believe that the district

4

court's decision is wrong, and, therefore, Mr. Buck was

5

entitled to a Certificate of Appealability.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So on the

7

merits -- on the merits then, you just want us to say,

8

oh, reasonable jurists could disagree about whether or

9

not he was unconstitutionally sentenced?

10

MS. SWARNS:

Or that the -- that the

11

reasonable jurists would conclude that the district

12

court's decision that Mr. Buck was not prejudiced was

13

incorrect, and, therefore, Mr. Buck was -- was entitled

14

to a Certificate of Appealability.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, for example, last year

16

in a case called Welch, the question came up on the

17

Certificate of Appealability, and we just said, well, of

18

course he should have gotten a Certificate of

19

Appealability because he's right.

20

the same thing, oddly enough, in one of the cases here.

21

We did the same thing in Trevino.

22

gotten a Certificate of Appealability because he has the

23

merits on his side.

24

want us to do?

25

And similarly, we did

Yes, he should have

That's essentially what you would

MS. SWARNS:

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, that does leave on

2

the table -- maybe this is what the Chief Justice was

3

saying -- this question of whether the Fifth Circuit is

4

just using the wrong approach and the wrong standards

5

for the Certificate of Appealability question.

6

MS. SWARNS:

Well, in this case the Fifth

7

Circuit's analysis completely ignored the heart of the

8

case in making its Certificate of Appealability

9

determination, right?

10

The center of Mr. Buck's claim has always

11

been the introduction of racial discrimination that

12

undermines the confidence in, not only his own death

13

sentence, but the integrity of the court's as well.

14

In assessing the debatability of the

15

district court's decision, the Fifth Circuit doesn't

16

engage at all around the central question here about

17

the -- the critical role of race in Mr. Buck's case, in

18

his sentence, in the integrity of the court's, and

19

ultimately in what Texas did in terms of acknowledging

20

the absence of finality in its case.

21

Circuit's conduct in conducting the Certificate of

22

Appealability analysis, you know, ignored critical facts

23

in this case.

24
25

So the Fifth

So that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The centers in this

case --

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. SWARNS:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- argue that the Court

3

had improperly denied a COA, and that was their basic

4

position.

5

just engaged the standard of issuance of a COA.

6

back to that.

7

wrong standard for denying the COA, or will you only be

8

satisfied if we say you win?

9

They didn't really engage the merits; they
We go

Are you satisfied if we say they used the

MS. SWARNS:

I think that the Fifth

10

Circuit -- you know, obviously, I would like for this

11

Court to say we win and Mr. Buck is entitled to a new --

12

a new, fair sentencing hearing.

13

my preference.

14

That would obviously be

I think in the posture of this case, this

15

Court can and should say that Mr. Buck is entitled to a

16

Certificate of Appealability because all of the

17

explanations and justifications that were presented by

18

Texas and the district court are incorrect and

19

unsustainable.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Now let's

21

start with the COA issue.

With respect to the COA

22

issue, I read your adversaries who are -- to say

23

Martinez, Trevino could never constitute an exceptional

24

circumstance to -- to justify the issuance of a COA.

25

Basically that's their position, 'cause they weren't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

made retroactive.

2

MS. SWARNS:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So first, what does the

4

retroactivity argument have to do with anything?

5

right?

6

Martinez and -- and Trevino retroactive if we recognize

7

it as an exceptional reason to forgive a procedural

8

default.

9

What does it apply to?

All

And aren't you making

And then second, there's a circuit split on

10

this question, and you recognize it in your brief.

11

have the Third Circuit using a three-part test that says

12

Martinez and Trevino, under certain circumstances, can

13

be a reason to find exceptional circumstance.

14

The Ninth Circuit has a six- or seven- or

15

eight-part test.

16

Fifth says never.

17

You

They never make it simple.

And the

Where do you stand on all these tests?

And

18

what's your position with respect to this -- to this

19

retroactivity question?

20

MS. SWARNS:

Well, with respect to

21

retroactivity, Teague governs new rules of

22

constitutional law that apply at the trial stage.

23

is just a rule that doesn't -- has no applicability.

24

squarely arises only in the habeas context, so Teague

25

just doesn't apply to Martinez and Trevino.

Alderson Reporting Company

This
It

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

With respect to its applicability to

2

Mr. Buck and to -- to Mr. Buck, this is a circumstance

3

where if the 60B was properly granted, Mr. Buck would be

4

back in the same exact position as were the Petitioners

5

in Martinez and Trevino.

6

cause to excuse the default of his trial counsel in

7

effectiveness claim in the first petition for habeas

8

corpus relief.

9

He would be arguing -- seeking

JUSTICE ALITO:

This is a very -- a very

10

unusual case, and what occurred at the penalty phase of

11

this trial is indefensible.

12

what the implications of your argument would be for all

13

of the other prisoners who -- let's say they're not even

14

capital cases, but they have -- they want now to raise

15

some kind of ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.

16

That is procedurally defaulted.

17

have relief from a prior judgment denying habeas relief.

18

But what concerns me is

And they say we should

And that -- what would prevent a ruling in

19

your favor in this case from opening the door to the

20

litigation of all of those issues so that those --

21

Martinez and Trevino would effectively be retroactive.

22
23
24
25

MS. SWARNS:

Well, I think there are three

factors, I think, that makes Mr. Buck's case unique.
First and foremost, it involves an express
appeal to racial bias that not only undermined the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

integrity of his own death sentence, it undermined the

2

integrity of the court's.

3

Second, he now faces execution.

This is a

4

death penalty case.

5

that death sentence that is unquestionably -- and I will

6

agree with you -- indefensible and uncompromised by

7

racial bias.

8
9

He now faces execution pursuant to

Third, there's no question of Mr. Buck's
diligence here.

Mr. Buck has consistently and

10

unrelentingly, you know, pursued relief on his claims.

11

So I think that those factors make Mr. Buck's case

12

unique from the vast majority --

13
14
15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's the Third Circuit

test, isn't it?
MS. SWARNS:

Yes.

It is.

And that makes

16

Mr. Buck unique from the vast majority of noncapital or

17

other prisoners who are going to bring these cases to

18

the Federal courts.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the -- the -- the

20

answer to Justice Alito is that in our opinion, we

21

should say our interpretation of Rule 60B, in case it

22

doesn't apply unless it's a capital case?

23

doesn't draw that distinction.

24
25

MS. SWARNS:

No.

Rule 60B

I think in terms of the

question of the extraordinariness factors, I think this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

Court can and should look to those that we've identified

2

in our brief.

3

First, is there a risk of injustice to the

4

Petitioner?

5

facing an execution.

6

Here we unquestionably have that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We're

The risk of

7

injustice, if it was a sentence for ten years, that's

8

unjust.

9

MS. SWARNS:

10
11

Absolutely.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So that

doesn't work.

12

MS. SWARNS:

So there are more.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MS. SWARNS:

15

The risk of injustice and impairing the

What else?

There are more.

16

integrity of the judicial system more broadly.

17

States --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

answer there.

20

integrity of the system.

21

death is different.

The

I guess the same

Sentenced to 40 years, that impairs the
I mean, I know that obviously,

22

MS. SWARNS:

Right.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

factor in why it's different in the context of

25

interpreting particular rules.

Alderson Reporting Company

But it's hard to

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

MS. SWARNS:

You know, I would say

2

additionally, though, here, Your Honor, particularly

3

unique to Mr. Buck's case, we have the State

4

acknowledging that it has no significant finality

5

interest in Mr. Buck's death sentence.

6

And when you add to that the fact that

7

Mr. Buck's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel

8

is -- is, you know, to be mildly meritorious, you know,

9

you have a group of factors which I think can -- this

10

Court should provide guidance around --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The State did change its

12

mind with respect to Mr. Buck's case, and I assume

13

they'll tell us that there's a reason for that.

14

not just because his defense counsel introduced it,

15

because that -- that was true in some other cases as

16

well.

17

It's

But if -- if we rely on that too much, won't

18

this discourage prosecutors from offering discretionary

19

concessions?

20

MS. SWARNS:

You know, this is a unique

21

circumstance.

I think that -- I don't believe it would

22

discourage prosecutors, because Texas doesn't actually

23

disagree with -- and cannot disagree with -- the

24

fundamental problem in this case, which is that it is

25

compromised by racial bias that undermines the integrity

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

of the courts.

2

Texas has certainly taken a different

3

position about what it should do about it, but it cannot

4

get away from those -- those core facts that establish

5

that, like no State has an interest in a death sentence

6

that is undermined by racial bias.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To the -- to the

8

extent it is a unique case, it really doesn't provide a

9

basis for us to say anything at all about how the Fifth

10

Circuit approaches Certificates of Appealability, does

11

it?

12

platform to issue general rules.

It's a unique case, so this would be an odd

13

But in the brief you say, well, the Fifth

14

Circuit grants these in a very small percentage of

15

cases.

16
17
18

The other circuits are much higher.
But if it is so unique, I don't know how we

can use it to articulate general rules.
MS. SWARNS:

Well, it's certainly an

19

extraordinary case.

And I think that because it is so

20

extraordinary, and because the lower courts failed to,

21

you know, acknowledge that and -- and reach that

22

conclusion, that this case sort of underscores the deep

23

need for guidance to the lower courts on the evaluation

24

and assessment and what factors should be considered in

25

determining when 60B is or is not appropriate.

Alderson Reporting Company

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Was it wrong?

Was

2

it wrong for the court of appeals to conduct the merits

3

inquiry in this case?

4

length in trying to determine whether or not the claims

5

were valid.

6

I mean, they went to considerable

Was that an error?

Should they have just

7

said, well, you know, the -- the test is what,

8

substantial -- showing a substantial -- a substantial

9

showing of denial?

They should have just done, you

10

know, kind of a sort of quick-and-dirty peek at the

11

merits and say, yeah, there might be something there.

12

MS. SWARNS:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

Yes.
So did they err in

looking at it more closely?

15

MS. SWARNS:

Certainly this Court has made

16

clear time and again the COA analysis is a threshold

17

review of the merits.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So should our

19

decision be just that, they erred in looking at the

20

merits?

21

Appealability and sent it back?

22

want, is it?

23

They should have just issued a Certificate of

MS. SWARNS:

That's not what you

I -- no, no, it's not.

Again,

24

I believe that this Court, because we do have the Fifth

25

Circuit and the district court going past the threshold

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

analysis and speaking substantively to the merits, this

2

Court can and should explain that those reasons that

3

have been offered by those courts are incorrect.

4

under the COA standard, if this Court -- a COA should

5

issue if the district court's decision was debatable or

6

wrong.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Well, but it seems

8

to me we're well beyond a COA should issue.

9

want us to say that.

You don't

You want us to say that there's

10

been a constitutional violation in this case and the

11

court of appeals was wrong in determining that there

12

wasn't.

13

MS. SWARNS:

I would like for this Court to

14

say that there was a constitutional violation in this

15

case --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Swarns, I would have

17

thought that your answer would be that, you know, you

18

think this is so -- such an extraordinary case, and that

19

the Fifth Circuit got this so wrong, that it's the best

20

proof that there is that the Court is -- is approaching

21

the COA inquiry in the wrong way.

22

MS. SWARNS:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24
25

Right.
If they reached the wrong

result in this case -MS. SWARNS:

Right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- it's because they are

2

just not understanding what the COA inquiry is all

3

about.

4

MS. SWARNS:

Right.

I mean, I agree,

5

absolutely.

I mean, just the fact that this Court

6

found -- was unable to find these facts and

7

circumstances debatable shows the -- the fact that the

8

Fifth Circuit is applying the standard incorrectly for

9

sure.

10

And it goes also to the need for guidance,

11

right, to the Fifth Circuit not only on the COA point,

12

but again, on the 60(b) point, because there really is a

13

substantial lack of information available to the lower

14

courts with respect to the evaluation of what is or is

15

not extraordinary.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what is the test

17

you -- should we say the Fifth Circuit should apply in

18

considering whether to issue Certificates of

19

Appealability?

20

statutory language?

21

Do you have anything to add to the

MS. SWARNS:

You know, I don't think -- I --

22

I don't have additional language.

23

has made quite clear that it's a threshold application.

24

What this case demonstrates is that the Fifth Circuit

25

has not been, and as this Court has noted in previous

Alderson Reporting Company

I think this Court

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

decisions, that the Fifth Circuit has not scrupulously

2

adhered to the application of the COA standard, and the

3

data that we provided to this Court sort of amplifies

4

and demonstrates that fact.

5

So I think that what you can do is use this

6

Court, again, as an example of how far the Fifth Circuit

7

is out of line from the -- the proper application of the

8

COA standard under these circumstances.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would it be possible to

10

defend what the Fifth Circuit did based on the prejudice

11

prong of Strickland?

12

evidence both relating to the offense that was committed

13

and to other conduct by Petitioner that would show

14

future dangerousness.

15

rest exclusively on this bizarre expert testimony; isn't

16

that correct?

17

There -- there was a lot of

MS. SWARNS:

It would -- it didn't have to

There is certainly the -- Texas

18

certainly presented evidence of future dangerousness in

19

this case.

20

that evidence was sort of the facts and circumstances of

21

the instant crime, Mr. Buck's lack of remorse

22

immediately after he was arrested for the instant crime,

23

and the domestic violence incidents and the prior

24

offenses.

25

I think that, however, the heart of those --

This Court has recognized that aggravated

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

crimes like this, exactly like the kind we are talking

2

about here, can and do trigger a racialized fear of

3

violence that can yield arbitrary death sentencing

4

decisions.

5

So the fact that we do face a case that does have very

6

aggravated facts sort of compounds the risk of prejudice

7

to Mr. Buck.

8
9

That was your holding in Turner v. Murray.

And what we have here is a circumstance
where not only do the terrible facts of the crime

10

trigger that real risk of an arbitrary death sentencing

11

decision, you have the expert stepping in and

12

compounding that risk and putting it -- putting an

13

expert scientific validity to this pernicious idea that

14

Mr. Buck would be more likely to commit criminal acts of

15

violence because he's black.

16

case is doubled, essentially.

17

So the risk in Mr. Buck's

In light of -- in light of those facts, in

18

light of the aggravating evidence here, and how

19

Dr. Quijano's opinion compounded the risk of violence --

It was absolute -- they were not given any

information?

9

MS. SWARNS:

If that were true -- no, they

10

were not.

11

the trial prosecutor fought very hard to make sure that

12

this jury did not receive the information about parole

13

eligibility.

14

concerned about making sure was redacted from

15

Dr. Quijano's report because he, in his report, had a

16

reference to the -- the 40 --

a.m. not sure at this moment.
So we do know that the jury was considering

22

the possibility of -- of a life sentence, and then we

23

have them asking for the psychiatric report, which

24

contains a sentence that says that Mr. Buck is, in fact,

25

more likely to commit criminal acts of violence because

Alderson Reporting Company

22

he's black.

2

that report, after the jury had heard it on direct and

3

cross-examination from the witness stand, so ultimately

4

we have a situation where the jury is literally making

5

the decision about Mr. Buck's life and death -- making

6

the future-dangerous decision while they have this

7

imprint in their hands.

8
9

That evidence, of course, once you have

And we also know, this is a jury that was
not able to make a quick decision on sentence.

You

10

know, notwithstanding Texas's claims that its case in

11

future dangerousness was overwhelming, this jury didn't

make a quick decision as you would have expected to see

if the case was, in fact, overwhelming.

powerfully to the question of whether Mr. Buck was

5

Dr. Lawrence --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

He killed people.

You --

7

you said that the evidence of his dangerousness was

8

limited to those with whom he had a romantic

9

relationship, but he killed at least two people with

10

whom he didn't have a -- he killed two people with whom

11

he did not have a romantic relationship; isn't that

12

right?

13

MS. SWARNS:

JUSTICE ALITO:

MS. SWARNS:

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

He killed --

His stepsister?
She survived.
I'm sorry.

All right.

Well, he shot her --

18

MS. SWARNS:

Yes, exactly.

And this is all

clearly in the context -- absolutely, he did.

There's

20

no question about the fact that he shot his -- his

sister.

22

of events where it arises out of the breakdown of his

23

relationship with his ex-girlfriend.

24

however, Dr. Lawrence presents evidence that the record

25

is that Mr. Buck has a positive institutional adjustment

And -- but all of that was in this one sequence

Alderson Reporting Company

And again,

Official - Subject to Final Review

25

history, that when he was previously incarcerated he was

2

held in minimum security, and that all of the crimes of

3

violence that took place in the Texas Department of

4

Corrections in the prior year were committed by people

5

who were getting involved, and there was no gang

involvement here.

7

So Dr. Lawrence's testimony highlights the

8

shortcomings or the limitations in Texas's case for

9

future dangerousness, right?

They say here we do have

10

evidence that -- that goes beyond what Texas has

11

presented.

12

evidence that Texas has that says he will be dangerous

13

in that context is Dr. Quijano's evidence that he has

immutable characteristics which establishes that he will

be dangerous no matter where he is.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I assume the

facts -- I assume the facts in the other Saldano cases

are similarly heinous, the ones where the state

they would be sentenced to death because of their race.

other words, regardless of whether the evidence was

admitted by the prosecution or by the defense, it would

13

MR. KELLER:

There's a key distinction

14

between when a government, a prosecuting authority, is

introducing evidence of racist dangerousness.

would be the equivalent of using race as an aggravator.

25

a prosecutor offering the testimony and using it as an

In the context of

highly prejudicial when the State is putting its in

primata behind it and using it as an aggravator.

And the nature of the evidence

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why does it matter who

7

uses race?

I mean, in Batson challenges we don't care

8

if the person exercising a racial challenge is the

9

prosecutor or the defense attorney.

We say neither

10

should use race in a negative way against a defendant.

11

So why is it different here?

12

for the prosecutor to introduce the greater likelihood

13

of a person being dangerous on the basis of race alone?

14

Not okay for the prosecutor, but it's less bad for the

15

defense attorney to do it?

MR. KELLER:

19

Yeah.

Why is it okay or not okay

To be clear, it's not

The issue, though, goes to the level of
And when defense counsel -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the level of

20

prejudice is the reasonable possibility that if one

21

juror, because Texas uses one juror does not agree with

22

death, death is not imposed, correct?

23

MR. KELLER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
So if one -- is it a

reasonable possibility that one juror, even the one who

sent the note that says is it possible to do parole,

exercise mercy if race wasn't used, can you answer that

question "absolutely not"?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't say it's not,

but why is that heinousness so much greater that no jury

could have exercised mercy?

16

MR. KELLER:

No juror.

The standard -- the standard in

For two reasons, and both are

controlled by Gonzalez v. Crosby.

The first is that the

only changed circumstance in this case since 2006 is the

7

8

is there was a lack of diligence in pursuing this claim.

9

An ineffective assistance claim is raised on Federal

habeas in the district court.

11

on that claim.

12

also is not even raised in the first 60(b) motion.

In the context of the second

60(b) motion.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, I mean, you listed a

18

whole bunch of things in which he could have done.

Did

19

those take place or not after we decided our case?

If

20

some of them did, which?

21

MR. KELLER:

The Federal habeas petition

22

asking for a COA and the first 60 (b) motion were before

23

Martinez.

24

that there the Petitioner was not pursuing the claim

with diligence even before the change in the law.

Isn't this substantially

different than Gonzalez?

Wasn't it important in

3

case.

4

in this posture, though, is not simply would an

did the district court abuse its discretion in declining

understanding, involved a change in the AEDPA statute of

As soon as I say those

of statutes of limitations, and this is one of them that

the court said he didn't -- he didn't pursue the change

diligently, and besides, it wasn't that big a deal, and

not every interpretation of Federal statute setting

As I read those reasons, I don't think

one of them applies here.

2

MR. KELLER:

So which one applies here.
Well, insofar as the

in that it has to be an extraordinary circumstance

justifying relief from the judgment.

MR. KELLER:

Yes.

The Fifth Circuit on

3

brief -- will hear oral argument --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Keller, you know, some

5

of the statistics that Petitioner have pointed us to --

6

in capital cases, a COA is denied in 60 percent of Fifth

7

Circuit cases as compared to 6 percent of Eleventh

8

Circuit cases, two roughly similar circuits where COA's

9

are denied in capital cases ten times more in the Fifth

10

Circuit.

I mean, it does suggest one of these two

11

circuits is doing something wrong.

12

MR. KELLER:

And the court has said that the

13

COA should serve a gatekeeping function.

The court also

14

noted that death is different.

15

the Fifth Circuit is provided substantial process.

16

insofar, though, as this Court were to -- if it were

17

going to conclude in this case that a COA should have

18

issued, it -- any such decision, I think, would be

19

limited to the unique facts of this case.

20

think there's anything that could be drawn by the Fifth

21

Circuit's wider practice in denying or granting COAs,

22

particularly in the capital posture when substantial

23

process is being afforded.

24

where the Fifth Circuit is simply ignoring these cases

25

and ignoring these claims.

And at the same time,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is your

2

suggestion that they deny more because they've taken up

3

more search and look at the merits than the other

4

circuits?

5

MR. KELLER:

I think it -- insofar as the

6

statistics could be shown that there is, in fact, a

7

different denial and grant rate, I think the level of

8

process that the Fifth Circuit is receiving and -- and

9

the quantum of argument may be going to those

10

statistics, because the Fifth Circuit is not simply

11

ignoring these claims.

12

And even here --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But this is the whole point,

really.

when you decide an appeal.

16

I mean, they are supposed to be performing a gatekeeping

function, not deciding the merits of the case.

18

They are not supposed to be doing what you do

MR. KELLER:

And they -- and they

And I don't think what the

19

Fifth Circuit did here is decide the merits.

to the Fifth Circuit that three State court judges, two

2

of their colleagues on the Fifth Circuit, two justices

3

of this Court, have said or found Mr. Buck's case

4

debatable, because that's the standard.

5

They don't pause and say, you know, people have some

6

basis for an argument here?

7

This is a serious question.

8
9

MR. KELLER:

This is not frivolous.

And the Fifth Circuit took

these arguments seriously.

10

It's debatable.

And this is our response --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's not the issue.

11

They are supposed to decide whether to grant COA or not

12

on whether the questions are serious or not, debatable,

13

not decide the merits.

14

in some situations, but how do you justify saying that

15

this is not debatable?

16

MR. KELLER:

I know it can appear a fine line

Here the issue would be could

17

reasonable jurists debate whether the district court

18

abused its discretion in finding extraordinary

19

circumstances?

20

And so while the reasonable jurist standard

21

is lower, that's balanced, though, against the more

22

deferential abuse of discretion standard and the

23

heightened extraordinary circumstances standard that

24

this Court has noted will rarely be met in the habeas

MR. KELLER:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. KELLER:

Yes.

Well, there we admit that since

the prosecution was the one that was eliciting the

16

race-based testimony, that that would go to a -- a due

process and equal protection violation, and that would

be an extraordinary circumstance --

Both points.

The State --

Because I don't -- I guess

if there's both points, tell me what the other point is

9

because I guess I just don't understand that point.

But

10

it seems more prejudicial when the defense attorney uses

11

it.

12

I mean, prosecution, you have a jury sitting

13

there, and it realizes that the prosecutor has an

14

interest in convicting a person and in getting a -- a

15

sentence that the prosecution wants, so everything is

16

discounted a little bit.

17

defendant's own lawyer introduces this, the jury is

going to say, well, it must be true.

defendant's lawyer thinks that this is true.

I didn't think that your

prejudice of having it done by the prosecutor and the

State of Texas feels a certain -- feels a special

11

responsibility when one of its employees engages in this

12

misconduct.

13

14

ineffective assistance-of-counsel question, and it has

15

to be adjudicated under the Strickland test.

16

And when the -- when the evidence is

MR. KELLER:

That's absolutely correct.

And

17

then when you look at the aggravating evidence of

18

executing a mother in front of her children and laughing

19

about it, and saying that the mother, quote, "got what

20

she deserved," unquote, and when we put in evidence from

21

ex-girlfriend -- this is a JA127A -- of repeatedly

22

beating her and threatening her with a gun, all of those

23

go to whether there would in fact be prejudice under the

24

Sixth Amendment, ineffective --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

And the legal question

44

here, right, is whether this ineffective assistance of

2

counsel claim, which has never been heard by any court,

3

is a strong one.

4

ineffective assistance here is likely to be prejudicial,

5

which it seems as though it's -- it's far more likely to

6

be prejudicial when the defense counsel does it.

7

And a strong one including that the

MR. KELLER:

Justice Kagan, when the State

8

is the one injecting race into a proceeding, that's

using it as an aggravator.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And if the Court will -People expect the State to

use whatever aggravators it has at hand.

12

don't expect the State to do something as improper as

13

this, but the people who understand that not everything

14

that the prosecution says about a defendant, you know,

15

that people -- the jurors should -- should think about

those claims seriously because the prosecution has

interests of its own.

I'm just repeating myself.

counsel does it, I mean, you know, who is the jury to

MR. KELLER:

Well, this Court, I don't

23

believe, has ever recognized a situation in which a

24

defense counsel's act could give rise to structural

25

error or per se prejudice.

And any such rule, I

prejudice analysis can still be done, but to say whether

underlying claim on the merits would be stronger, and --

This Court has long recognized

That commitment is as urgent today as

17

With respect to -- to Texas's arguments, I

want to begin by making clear that, first of all, this

19

Court in Georgia v. McCollum did make clear, as I think

20

Justice Sotomayor noted, that the equal protection

21

concerns that are implicated by the introduction of race

22

into the criminal justice system absolutely are

23

triggered by defense counsel's conduct.

24

that was a situation where defense counsel exercised

25

preemptory challenges based on race.

10

This is

I would also like to just be clear that the

11

prosecution's reliance on Dr. Quijano's testimony here

12

was real.

13

prosecutor was required to follow up on Dr. Quijano's

14

opinion and -- and reiterate it on cross-examination,

15

and then go further and argue in closing that the jury

16

should rely on Dr. Quijano to find Mr. Buck likely to

17

commit criminal acts of violence, and further argue that

18

the jury should disregard the aspects of Dr. Quijano's

19

opinion that conflicted with a finding of future

20

dangerousness.

21

This wasn't a circumstance where the

When Texas did its -- its review of -- of

22

death row after it conceded error in Saldano, it looked

23

through all of the cases on death row to see what else

24

was contaminated by Dr. Quijano's racist criminal

25

violence opinion.

And one of the other cases it looked

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48

at and ruled out was the Anthony Graves case, which

2

demonstrates the options available to this prosecutor

3

under these circumstances.

4

In the Anthony Graves case, Dr. Quijano was

5

called as a defense witness, just like he was here.

In

6

the Anthony Graves case, the defense elicited

7

Dr. Quijano's race as criminal violence opinion on

8

direct examination, just as here.

9

in the Graves case, the prosecutor did not reiterate it

But the difference is

10

on direct examination, and -- and then in closing argued

11

that the jury should disregard Dr. Quijano's opinion.

12

The prosecutor here absolutely capitalized

13

on trial counsel's error.

14

about that.

15

could have gone the Graves route, but this prosecutor

16

chose to go through the door that was opened by trial

17

counsel and rely on Dr. Quijano's race as criminal

18

violence opinion.

19

There is just no question

They made a choice that, you know, they

Counsel for Texas also notes that the last

20

note that the jury sent out was a request to review the

21

crime scene video, which is absolutely true, but it

means that the last two notes that this jury looked

23

at -- the two -- two things that they asked for, right,
