ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

IN NOS. 15-1358 AND 15-1359

11

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case marks the return of Iqbal as

12

Plaintiffs seek to hold essentially the same defendants

13

liable for the same actions arising in the same

14

extraordinary circumstances in the wake of the

15

September 11 terrorist attacks.

16

All of the judges below concluded that

17

Plaintiffs' core theory is squarely foreclosed by Iqbal.

18

But the Second Circuit majority then formulated its own

19

list merger theory of liability, premising liability on

20

the alleged decision of Attorney General Ashcroft to

21

merge the New York list of detainees, which had not been

22

fully vetted, with the INS list, thereby continuing the

23

hold-until-cleared policy for detainees on both lists.

24

Bivens' liability does not attach here for

25

at least three reasons.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

First, the Bivens remedy should not be

2

extended to national security and immigration policy

3

decisions by senior officials in the wake of the

4

September 11 attacks.

5

imposed, it's for Congress, not this Court, to do so.

6

If the damages remedy is to be

Second, the list merger theory suffers from

7

the same pleading deficiencies that this Court

8

identified in Iqbal itself.

9

is an obvious alternative and noninvidious explanation

Among other things, there

10

of the list merger decision.

11

about the status of detainees on the New York list, the

12

list merger was undertaken to avoid the inadvertent or

13

premature release of a dangerous terrorist.

14

Given the uncertainty

And third, the defendants here violated no

15

clearly established right.

16

to every reasonable defendant that merging the lists in

17

the wake of the 9/11 attacks would be unconstitutional

18

rather than risking premature release of a detainee on

19

the New York list.

20

It would not have been clear

I think the easiest way for this Court to

21

resolve this case is through the Iqbal pleading theory.

22

But given this Court's admonition that the existence of

23

the Bivens remedy is an antecedent question that the

24

Court should address first, let me start there.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- you seem to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

assuming that the whole case is about the merging of the

2

New York list with the other list, but I thought that

3

this was -- this case was identified as a prison

4

conditions case.

5

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

6

broader theory was raised below.

7

every judge to consider it below, the district court and

8

the panel majority, and it -- it is also, I think,

9

beyond the -- it's not within the scope of the question

10
11

So, Your Honor, that
It was rejected by

presented.
But even if -- if -- and I think the reason

12

that it was barred below is because it squarely

13

foreclosed by -- by Iqbal, both on the substantive due

14

process claim and on the equal protection claim.

15

On the substantive due process claim, what

16

we have is an -- a -- a facially-valid constitutional

17

policy to -- to -- that could be applied to individuals

18

with individualized suspicion of terrorism.

19

And if you look at the allegations in the

20

complaint, and these are paragraphs 61 and 65 of the

21

complaint, all that is alleged is that Ashcroft and

22

Mueller met regularly with a -- this is on page 274A of

23

the appendix to the petition -- that in the -- and this

24

is paragraph 61 -- that Ashcroft and Mueller met with a

25

small group of officials to exert maximum pressure on
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

the individuals arrested, and then in paragraph 65, on

2

the next page, that the punitive conditions in which the

3

MDC and class members were placed were the direct result

4

of the strategy.

5

There is no allegation that Ashcroft and

6

Mueller or Ziglar created the punitive conditions, or

7

that they required the putative conditions.

8

the right, as the Second Circuit itself held, and the

9

district court held, to presume that the policy would be

10
11

They had

implemented lawfully.
The only real theory that survives, I think,

12

Your Honor, really is the list merger theory, and that

13

theory fails.

14

that context how the case -- how the situation looked to

15

the Attorney General -- to Attorney General Ashcroft

16

who's alleged to be the decisionmaker.

I think it's critical to understand in

17

I'll come back to the -- to the failure of

18

the complaint to allege that he was the decisionmaker,

19

but even taking that, what he faced was the New York

20

list which involved aliens, all of whom were out of

21

status, and had been picked up in the course of the

22

Pent-Bomb investigation.

23

He knew that not all of those aliens had had

24

individualized suspicion determinations, but that some

25

may well have had ties nexus to terrorism, and he knew
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

that the conditions of confinement would be lawful.

2

is not disputed that those would be lawful as to those

3

with individualized suspicion.

4

Faced with that situation, the Second

5

Circuit majority found that the list merger decision

6

could only explained by putative intent or by

7

discriminatory intent.

8
9

It

But there is an obvious alternative
explanation for the decision that Attorney General

10

Ashcroft would have faced in deciding to merger the

11

list, is that you couldn't tell who was and who was not

12

had -- who did and who did not have a potential link to

13

terrorism.

14

everyone until cleared, to apply the hold-until-cleared

15

policy is best explained, not by invidious intent, but

16

by the desire to avoid the premature and inadvertent

17

release of a dangerous terrorist.

13

is that Ashcroft and Mueller knew that the FBI had not

paragraph 67 -- tying the plaintiffs to terrorism, but

authorized their prolonged detention, in restrictive

conditions, even after local offices reported.

Mueller is not that they prolonged the -- prolonged the

that many of them have nothing to do with terrorists,

justified in October to persist for months and months

conditions of confinement.

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

Your Honor, they -­

12

Now, the -- the -- there is -- the -- the

core of the claim that the Second Circuit saw against

Attorney General Ashcroft was the decision to submit the

individuals to the -- to the restrictive conditions in

How could they have -­

how could they have access to habeas when they were

10

locked up without access to a lawyer, without access to

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, there

13

were individuals who did file habeas petitions and -­

and those individuals were largely released before the

claims could be adjudicated.

16

that -- that the -- that Bivens -- the extension of

Bivens would really be quite extraordinary to a national

immigration concerns, I think, do raise the exact same

20

concerns, Your Honor, as the national security ones.

I suppose that in 1942,

All right.

would be pretty tough for a judge in a district court to

MR. LAMKEN:

And I think the answer is that

12

you pinpoint his awareness and the injuries that these

Respondents are claiming damages for.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you say it in

talking about -- "realized that they were not

had reason to believe that some among that group might

harsh treatment without raising an inference of

Were there any legal proceedings

MS. MEEROPOL:

There were some habeas

10

petitions filed.

11

to those petitions being filed was to move the detainee

12

up to the front of the list, to clear him so that he

13

could be removed from the country and from the

14

restrictive conditions of confinement before a court

15

could have the opportunity to rule on the legality of

16

the detention.

17

were about the -- the right to detain these people in

18

itself, not about conditions of confinement.

19

In general, the government's response

And importantly, those habeas petitions

It is still not clear today that one can use

20

a habeas petition to challenge conditions of

21

confinement, and it wasn't clear in the Second Circuit

22

at the time either.

23

filed eventually, when some detainees finally had access

24

to counsel, although restricted access, those -- those

25

petitions were not actually ruled on by a court.

So while habeas petitions were

whether what was happening to the detainees was lawful

8

It was not just to impose

It was also, as we allege in

Now, my friend argued that the DOJ

9

Petitioners cannot be on the hook for the substantive

10

due process claim in this case, a claim which was not

11

presented in Iqbal.

12

Iqbal, just the equal protection claim, because the -­

13

because the DOJ Petitioners did not set all the details

14

of the restrictive conditions of confinement.

15

There was no conditions claim in

But their order itself, paragraph 61,

16

requires keeping individuals in solitary confinement, in

17

isolation.

18

people are kept from accessing the outside world.

19

cannot be done in a general population unit.

order that requires solitary confinement for individuals

21

who are arrested in connection with the terrorism

22

investigation, but whom the attorney general and the

23

other DOJ Petitioners know there is no nondiscriminatory

24

reason to suspect of any ties to terrorism, that states

25

the substantive due process claim.

That is the way within the prison system

as to be arbitrary and punitive.
This is what the panel found so compelling,

3

I believe, about the merger of the New York list and the

4

national list, that it was not a situation where some of

5

the men on that list perhaps hadn't been vetted.

6

Rather, the entire list, 300 men, were people for whom

7

the FBI had not stated any interest or lack of interest.

8

And it was this list of men who we allege Attorney

9

General Ashcroft ordered should be treated as of

interest to the 9/11 investigation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

that our previous cases instruct that we should not go

What the circuit held

as to that is that the question of whether officials can

conspire with each other is so fact-intensive and had

been so inconclusively briefed in the district court,

25

yet it was required to remand back to the district to

vis-à-vis each other such that a 1985 claim would be

Is there precedent in your

favor on this point that there can be this conspiracy

if -- if it's established by the facts?

MS. MEEROPOL:

Yes.

fact-intensive about the argument that government

14

within that same entity don't conspire among themselves,

they're just doing their -- doing their jobs?

16

MS. MEEROPOL:

Well, I think it depends on

17

the role of the high-level officials vis-à-vis the

I want to make sure to address the arguments

6

from the argument by the DOJ Petitioners.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

deliberate indifference, but not as to Sherman.

incredibly important point that I want to make sure to

get out, which is that we disagree with the MDC
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

Petitioners' statement that there was a terrorism

2

designation here, that there was reason to believe that

3

any of the 9/11 detainees had ties to terrorism.

4

There was no designation.

What there was is

5

the fact that some men were arrested in connection to

6

the terrorism investigation.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

The whole position as I

8

understand it, the way it was presented today, was that

9

the FBI had a list and the -- there was no way they

10

could determine what degree of information the FBI had

11

as to any particular person.

12

MS. MEEROPOL:

But they were told what

13

information the FBI was relying on.

14

paragraph 70, it's 71 through 74 of our complaint, that

15

actually a liaison to the headquarters investigation was

16

providing the MDC with information about all the men.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's in

With all the information?

18

Do you -- you think that the FBI in a -- in a

19

sensitive -- investigation of something sensitive like

20

this about terrorism would necessarily have told people

21

at MDC every bit of information they had connecting

22

people with -- with terrorism?

23

MS. MEEROPOL:

Well, our factual allegation

24

was that they were told all the information that was

25

relevant to the threat that the men posed to the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

institution.

2

And also important here is what the OIG has

3

explained about the meaning of the -- of the of-interest

4

designation.

5

interest to the 9/11 investigation meant only that they

6

were not, not of interest.

that was happening in New York.

interest in an individual, that individual was held as

11

of interest to the 9/11 investigation.

12

So even if there is word being sent out

13

that, you know, these men are of interest to the

14

investigation, we have to be careful with them, what the

15

MDC Petitioners received was that of-interest

16

designation, which meant very little based on the policy

17

being applied here.

18

information; for example, that Ahmed Khalifa was

19

arrested -- was encountered by the FBI in the context of

20

the 9/11 investigation, had violated the immigration

21

law, and that the FBI might be interested in him.

22

is the actual information that was provided that we have

23

made available in the complaint.

people whom you know there is no basis to suspect them

religious characteristics with the 9/11 hijackers, and

4

to decide that that group of people poses such a threat

5

that they must be placed in the most restrictive

6

conditions of confinement that exist in the Federal

7

system while we take the time, eight months, up to eight

8

months, to determine whether there actually is any basis

to suspect them of anything other than an immigration

what would there be to deter the creation of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, of

Well, I suppose one

answer would be the normal injunctive action would

challenge the constitutionality of the policy, which

11

would seem, at least at first blush, to be a more

12

appropriate way of doing it than to -- than individual

13

damages actions against officials responsible.

14

MS. MEEROPOL:

But an injunctive -- an

injunctive claim, while it could stop, currently,

16

current unconstitutional conduct cannot deter future

unconstitutional conduct from occurring.

deter the future attorney general from creating an

First, this would be a massive extension of

Malesko said, Justice Kennedy, you had asked,

21

that unlike a Bivens remedy, which we have never

the proper means for doing so.

And although my friend on the other side

11

suggests that a damages remedy is not a threat to the

13

the -- the judgment that this Court is ill-equipped

14

to -- to make, and that Congress should make.

15

With respect to 1985(3), Justice Kennedy, I

16

want to make just one quick point, which is that the -­

17

the -- the DOJ defendants would be -- and all the

18

defendants would be subject to qualified immunity for

19

1985(3) because it was not clear that officials within a

There's case law suggesting they couldn't.

13

1985.

The fact that it wasn't clear that there was a

that there wasn't a right that was being violated.

think that's a situation in which qualified immunity

But just to close what -- with what the

restrictive conditions of confinement -- not the

6

of confinement were okay for some with individualized

suspicion, but he had no way to know which ones were and

8

which ones were not subject to that condition.

9

In that situation, he made the decision to

10

subject the whole group to a hold-until-cleared policy

11

until they could figure it out.

12

The idea that because in 20/20 hindsight we

13

can identify the particular individuals who were not -­

15

thus wrongly detained does not change the reasonableness
