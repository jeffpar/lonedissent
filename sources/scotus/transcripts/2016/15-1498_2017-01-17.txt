ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The court of appeals held that the

11

definition of crime of violence in 18 U.S.C 16(b) is

12

unconstitutionally vague on its face, relying on this

13

Court's decision in Johnson, holding the residual clause

14

in the Armed Career Criminal Act unconstitutionally

15

vague.

16

That was wrong for two reasons.

First, the

17

standard of vagueness applicable in an immigration

18

proceeding is not the same as in a criminal proceeding,

19

because the Constitution does not require prior notice

20

that conduct will give rise to removal and also because

21

the immigration laws have long been administered by the

22

executive and administrative proceedings because --

23

under broad delegations of authority because of the

24

close relation of immigration to foreign relations and

25

national security.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Second, though, in any event, under the

2

criminal vagueness standard applied in Johnson 16(b) is

3

not unconstitutional as exemplified by this Court's

4

unanimous decision in Leocal and the more than -- and

5

the more than 30 years that 16(b) has been on the

6

books --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Kneedler, didn't

8

the government argue in -- when Johnson was before us,

9

that if the ACCA residual clause was invalid, then 16(b)

10

would be vulnerable because it was subject to the same

11

central objection.

12

argument?

13

Wasn't that the government's

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the -- the United

14

States was responding to the argument that -- that was

15

made in Johnson, which was broader than the Court's

16

ultimate rationale.

17

risk alone was thought to be a problem, the Court made

18

clear in Johnson that cases involving references to

19

substantial risk are not inherently problematic and, in

20

fact, there are -- there are many such -- such ones.

21

The -- to the extent substantial

The Court focused its analysis on two

22

different aspects, but they -- but they have features

23

that 16(b) does not have and make 16(b) very

24

distinctive.

25

has not given rise to the interpretive confusion that

And, in fact, that's the reason why 16(b)

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

finally led this Court in Johnson to hold the ACCA

2

provision unconstitutional.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought the Johnson,

4

two features at issue were the fact that we were asking

5

courts to imagine what the ordinary crime was, and there

6

was no way to even think about what that was.

7

Your adversary points out, with burglary, if

8

the ordinary crime is during the day, there's one level

9

of risk.

If it's at night, there's a different level of

10

risk.

11

it's forcible or merely walking through an open door

12

uninvited.

13

reasons, but there -- the level of what -- or what

14

constitutes an ordinary crime was somewhat at the center

15

of Johnson.

16

The nature of the entry is at question, whether

It may be easier with burglary for lots of

Why isn't it at the center here?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Because I -- I -- there are

17

several very important distinctions between this case

18

and Johnson with -- with respect to that.

19

The -- the ACCA residual clause spoke in

20

terms of a serious potential risk that serious injury to

21

another person might -- might result.

22

pointed out, that created uncertainty about things that

23

could happen even after the offense was committed and

24

injury to people, bystanders or anyone else it could be.

25

And as the Court

Section 16(b) is very different in that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

respect.

2

presents a substantial risk that physical force will be

3

used against the person or property of another, and

4

that's very different in several respects.

5

It asks whether the offense by its nature

It confines the analysis in both a temporal

6

and functional sense to the elements of the offense.

7

You don't look at what conduct might -- might have

8

happened afterward.

9

of the offense because the -- the question is whether

It focuses narrowly on the elements

10

the use of physical force might be used in the course of

11

committing that offense.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, may I ask,

13

Mr. Kneedler, because this aspect of your brief was

14

confusing to me because sometimes you're talking about

15

temporal, and sometimes you're talking about functional.

16

And I want to know what you think the real limitation

17

is.

18

possession of a shotgun example; right?

So take the example that you use, which is the

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

Right.
And you say that that would

fall outside of Section 16.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.
And the question is why?

24

Temporally, you know, you're possessing a shotgun when

25

you shoot somebody.

You can't do it any other way.

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

the temporal analysis doesn't work.

2

that example that makes it fall outside of Section 16,

3

whereas you argued it would have fallen inside of ACCA?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

So what is it about

Well, the -- well, first of

5

all, in ACCA that was part of the confusion.

6

the confusion in Johnson itself.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

That was

Yes, exactly.
But -- but -So why are you so sure that

there would not be the confusion under Section 16?

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think, again, because

12

of Leocal.

13

problem concluding that it was not covered.

14

reason is that Leocal -- excuse me -- 16(b) requires a

15

risk of the use of physical force, the -- an act of

16

violent crime, as the Court described it in Leocal, and

17

the possession of a -- of a sawed-off shotgun at any

18

particular moment in time.

19

in its use at all for -- for --

20

And the courts after Leocal have had no

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the

It doesn't have to culminate

Well, that's absolutely

21

true.

22

it could culminate in its use, but it didn't have to

23

culminate in its use.

24
25

And that's what gave us trouble in ACCA because

But then you take a case like burglary, and
you could say the exact same thing about burglary.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

Somebody could walk in on a burglary and all of a sudden

2

there would be a use of force.

3

happen in such a way that nobody walked in and there

4

wouldn't be a use of force.

But a burglary could

5

So, again, it just seems as though we're

6

replicating the same kind of confusions, and there's

7

nothing that separates the two.

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

Or at least I'm trying to

find out --

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

I -- I --

I --- what you think separates

the two.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

I don't -- I -- I don't

15

think so, because another important aspect or textual

16

point in 16(b) is whether the offense by its nature

17

presents a substantial risk.

"By its nature" means in

18

its natural, ordinary sense.

And, for example, in

19

Leocal, said in no -- the Court said in no ordinary or

20

natural sense could the -- could DUI be regarded as the

21

affirmative use of physical force.

22

violent --

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's not a

You know --- crime.
-- I -- I was very struck by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

that language, too.

2

more than some of the other language you pointed to in

3

its brief, that might suggest that there's some

4

distinction between 16(b) and -- and the ACCA residual

5

clause.

6

And I think it's that language,

But on the other hand, "by its nature" seems

7

to suggest an elements focus, a real elements focus.

8

Look at the elements and ask, given those elements,

9

given the nature of the offense, what's going to happen?

10

But, you know, the elements section of Section 16 is

11

Section 16(a).

So it can't be all about all elements.

12

So what is that "by its nature" doing?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it's by its nature of

14

the offense, which would incorporate its elements.

15

think elements are central to both (a) and (b).

16

involves the actual -- actual use of force or threat in

17

use of force or attempted use of force.

18

the actual or threatened use of force.

19

16(b), the question is whether the elements add up to an

20

offense in which there is a risk of force being used,

21

even if it doesn't have to.

22

(a)

The element is
Whereas under

And burglary -- I think burglary is a

23

classic example -- is a classic example of that.

24

think --

25

We

But why isn't also

Alderson Reporting Company

And I

possession of a shotgun a classic example of that?

2
3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, let me explain, if I

may.

4

Burglary is -- is descended from the common

5

law, and its rationale is precisely because of the risk

6

that the -- that the burglar will encounter someone in

7

the course of committing the burglary.

8

it is logical, built into, inherent in the crime of

9

burglary that there may be a response to an uninvited

And -- and it --

10

entry into a home or -- or other structure.

11

nature, that transaction, that -- those elements of

12

burglary create the risk that force will have to be

13

used.

By its

The same is true of kidnapping.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and give me a

15

contrast.

16

ACCA residual clause would not fall under 16(b) because

17

the same thing could not be said.

18
19
20

And by contrast, what that fell under the

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I mean, one that did

not fall under the -- the ACCA -JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.

Give me one that would

21

fall under the ACCA residual clause, but -- but -- or

22

where there was confusion as to whether it fell under

23

the residual clause.

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:
example there.

Begay -- Begay is a good

It was precisely the -- the crime

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

involved in Leocal where the Court had no trouble in a

2

two-page decision saying that DUI is not covered because

3

of this textual difference, because there has to be risk

4

of the use of force, which is not the accidental or sort

5

of negligent conduct.

6

Whereas in Begay, the Court struggled with

7

how to -- how to deal with that under the residual

8

clause.

9

the purposeful, violent, aggressive test in order to

It -- it created an extra-textual limitation,

10

weed out negligent or accidental offenses.

11

explicit text of -- of 16(b) itself takes care of that

12

problem.

13

Whereas the

So that is an important difference.
Another important difference, though, that I

14

haven't mentioned yet is that the residual clause tied

15

the level of risk to four enumerated offenses, which

16

were not consistent with each other.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think that you're quite

18

right that that was one of the arguments in Johnson that

19

they said make the statute confusing.

20

seem odd before we look at Johnson that giving examples

21

makes the statute more vague.

22

counterintuitive.

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

correct.

It -- it does

It's a -- it's a little

Right.
But you're -- you're

I think that's the way the Johnson court saw

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1
2

it.
MR. KNEEDLER:

And I -- and I think the -- I

3

think the problem was not examples per se, but -- but

4

the fact that they were conflicting examples that I

5

think the court came to conclude embedded an

6

arbitrariness into the ACCA residual clause in all its

7

applications.

8

what -- there was, like, an ingredient in that statute

9

that made it incapable of consistent application.

10
11

And that -- and that's effectively

That's not true here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Kneedler, it's

12

absolutely right that the court in Johnson said that

13

those examples compounded the problem.

14

essential problem that the court thought existed was the

15

use of the ordinary case analysis.

16

ask you the question that the court asked in Johnson,

17

and I'd -- I -- how do we answer this question?

18

what the court said in Johnson:

19

But the

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think it's not the

4

clause, you start out by looking at the elements of the

5

offense.

6

such that, by their nature, they give rise to a

7

substantial risk of injury?

8
9

Again, unlike -- unlike in the ACCA residual

What -- and are the elements of the offense

Now, for some offenses, I think that you can
look at the long history of the offense.

And burglary

10

is an example.

11

burglary is a classic example of a crime of violence.

12

And, in fact, the Senate Report on this provision says

13

that burglary is the classic example.

14

at LeFave or other historical materials, it is because

15

of the risk of force that might be used.

16

this -- this statute also concerned risk to property.

17

So certain offenses, I think the --

18

Indeed, in Leocal, this Court said that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And if one looks

Of course,

So can I give you another

19

example just to test how this test works?

20

look to the elements of the -- the offense to see if

21

they give rise to a risk of injury.

22

right?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

You say you

Do I have that

Yes.
Okay.

How do we do

vehicular flight under that example?

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm just trying to

2

not -- you know, I'm just trying to figure out what the

3

difference is if we look at it that way, because that

doesn't sound so different from what we were trying to

do in ACCA.

honestly.

And you might be right.

I'm

In fact, it sounds kind of the same as,

work?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Vehicular flight from a

10

police officer after being ordered to stop is, again, if

11

you think by its nature, what -- what was the

12

legislature envisioning when it enacted that?

13

think, again, it's parallel to burglary.

14

such that in the -- in the course of committing the

15

offense, in the course of the flight, not something that

16

might be collateral or down the road, is the --

version is one that the legislature had singled out

3

because of the particular risk.

4

important to look at the State statute and what was it

5

driving at?

6

What -- what harms was it -- was it intending?

7

So it's -- it's

What are the -- what are the elements?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And go back to possession of

8

a shotgun, because I'm running over in my mind my memory

9

of the Johnson oral argument where basically the SG's

10

office made exactly this argument about possession of a

11

shotgun, how the elements of that offense are understood

12

to give rise to a significant level of risk.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think the concern,

14

one of the concerns mentioned in -- in Johnson was what

15

if the shotgun might be used way down the road remotely

16

from that -- from any -- remote in time from any moment

17

in time when the -- when the person was arrested

18

possessing the shotgun.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Presumably, the person is

20

possessing the shotgun when the person kills somebody,

21

so it's -- temporally, I don't think that that argument

22

works.

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

The -- the offense

24

continues for the entire duration of possession, but

25

we're not saying that that's enough.

Alderson Reporting Company

There has to be a

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

substantial risk in the -- in the course of committing

2

the offense.

3

And as one of the -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I remember the

4

government arguing in Johnson that most people who are

5

found with sawed-off shotguns are committing crimes.

6

Why isn't that a substantial risk of force being used?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Well -If statistically -- if

statistically -- and I don't remember the statistics

10

now, but they were very clear then that a huge amount --

11

number of the crimes of possession of a shotgun were --

12

led to criminal activity.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think it is the -- is

14

the use of force necessary for the crime of possession

15

of the shotgun.

16

And -- and possession itself --

Well, the use of force

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Something has to be

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the Court often -- if

8

the Court has what might be referred to as a drive-by

9

ruling, I wouldn't say it was drive-by.

It was

10

considered, but -- but usually you want adversarial

11

presentation by the parties.

12

For example, one important -- several

13

important aspects of deGeorge, it did not discuss this

14

Court's earlier decision in the Mahler case in which the

15

Court indicated that there could be a looser standard

16

of -- or would be a looser standard of vagueness in

a critical difference.

person can be removed for conduct that was not a basis

or not.

But what -- what's at stake

can't be viewed just from that perspective.

Well, if I can address

point obtains, which is that a person can be removed on

That means that the alien has no constitutionally-based

right to notice.

the Vagueness Doctrine has far less force in this

context.

Again, whether it's a crime or not a crime.

6

And, therefore, the notice piece of

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the Court -- if the Court

were to hold that 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague in

8

criminal cases, what would the impact -- in criminal

cases involving the application of the categorical

10

approach, what would the -- what would the implications

11

of that be?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, as we cite in our

13

brief, there are a number of places in Title 18 where

14

the definition of crime of violence is used, either by

15

express reference to 16(b) or by use of the same

16

formulation like in 924C where the same formulation

17

is -- is used.

standards apply rather than the criminal one loses some

of its force for precisely that reason?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I don't think so.

For

one thing, I think it's -- it's important to recall that

are -- that constitute a ground for removal just like

all of the other aggravated felony provisions.

In the immigration laws, for

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

That is -- that is true.

20

And -- and for that reason, the Court may well want to,

21

in our view, sustain 16(b) by applying the criminal

22

standard, because if it -- if it is sustained under the

criminal standard, as we think it clearly should be,

say, if there are in -- if there are those -- that many,

where we struggled under ACCA, but where the answer is

clear under 16(b), so that I understand what it -- what

kind of distinction you're drawing.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

I think DUI is

6

sort -- is the prime example.

7

that DUI was not covered.

8

it's only -- the Court's only occasion to have to

9

address this in 30 years because of the text of 16(b),

Leocal itself concluded

11

the sawed-off shotgun, which this Court in Torres said

12

was not covered by 16(b), and -- and we believe that

13

that's correct, again, because of the -- the -- you

14

don't have to use force in order to possess the -- the

15

shotgun, even though injury could result under the ACCA

clause, perhaps, and that's what -- that's what was

confusing under the -- under the ACCA clause.

18
19
20
21

I think

So I -- I think those are two prime
examples.

But I -- 16(b) -JUSTICE KAGAN:

is really important for me.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

what our differences are.

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yeah.

Well -- well --

I'm trying to figure out

Yes.

And -- and in -- in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

Begay, where the Court formulated the extra-textual test

2

of the act -- I forget the precise words, but violent

aggressive conduct, it pointed out that some such

4

limitation was also necessary because of -- otherwise

5

like pollution offenses or -- or consumer product

6

offenses might be covered.

7

So the Court -- the Court again was -- was

8

juggling with the way the ACCA residual clause operates

9

in order to figure out how to exclude that one.

There's

10

no question that those crimes are clearly excluded under

the ACCA clause.

12

On the other hand, some other crimes besides

burglary, like kidnapping or escape, I think if -- if

one pictures those offenses, they clearly present a risk

that physical force will be used and give this statute a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

As Justice Sotomayor points out, there were

12

two critical factors that this Court pointed to in

13

Johnson that, quote, "conspired to make the ACCA

14

residual clause unconstitutional."

15

they are both present here.

16

ordinary instance, the ordinary case of a set of

17

elements, and second, then from that hypothesis,

18

estimating the degree of risk of some sort.

19

Justice Ginsburg points out, the government correctly,

20

back in Johnson, said that those two factors are in

21

existence here in Section 16(b), and that the residual

22

clause here was, quote, "equally susceptible to

23

challenge."

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Everyone agrees that

It's hypothesizing the

And as

There was something that --

that isn't here, Mr. Rosenkranz, and that is a long

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

history of struggling and failing to come up with an

2

interpretation.

3

don't have that same history.

4

that there's any question that we would not have said

5

what we said in Johnson had Johnson been the first case.

6

And I'm wondering why you think we
Because I don't think

Johnson was the umpteenth case, and we had

7

gone back and forth and we had struggled and we couldn't

8

figure out, and -- and here we don't seem to have any of

9

that.

It seems as though -- and not only with respect

10

to this Court, but with respect to lower courts -- it

11

seems that everybody is getting along just fine.

12

much as I can't quite understand what the difference is,

13

there just does seem to be a difference in practice.

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And

Well, Justice Kagan, let

15

me -- let me give two answers.

16

whole notion that the government is discussing about a

17

different experience with ACCA than with Section 16(b)

18

is revisionist history.

19

The first is that this

Every single ACCA case that this Court

20

decided was presented to this Court in simultaneous cert

21

petitions in the 16(b) context, and this Court would

22

then JVR the 16(b) cases, and the lower courts and this

23

Court would then cross-reference ACCA case -- ACCA

24

residual clause cases into Section 16(b), treating them

25

equivalently.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

So this Court's experience with the ACCA

2

residual clause is its experience with Section 16(b).

3

And the whole series of questions you asked, Justice

4

Kagan, about well, what about Sykes, how would this turn

5

out here?

6

itself?

7

here.

8

the -- that is, the Sykes issue -- is already presented

9

as a circuit conflict right now in the lower courts.

What about Chambers?

What about Johnson

Every single one of those cases is coming back
We know that they're coming.

Sykes is already --

10

is roiling the lower courts.

11

case where the majority and the dissent of Sykes are

12

being played out in the Fifth Circuit right now.

13

the same will be true of all of those.

14

It

There's a Fifth Circuit

And

And then, secondly, it is simply not true to

15

say that -- I'd like to say that everyone is getting

16

along just fine in the lower courts.

17

and the National Immigration Project, we've identified

18

10 circuit splits, some of them on exactly identical

19

elements.

20

The courts on either side -- it's not just that they're

21

engaged in different elemental analysis.

22

each side are fundamentally disagreeing about what the

23

ordinary case of a particular crime is.

24
25

Between our brief

And what is the problem with those cases?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
that 16(b) is more precise?

The courts on

But what of the argument

For one thing, it is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

limited to in the course of commission of the offense,

2

and that the offender must be the one who uses the

3

force.

4

the victim's property.

5

that the ACCA residual clause lacked.

And in addition, it covers use of force against

6

So it -- it has a specificity

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, let me start

7

with the -- with in-the-course-of, which took a -- a lot

8

of Mr. Kneedler's argument time.

9

Two things -- well, three things to say

10

about it.

11

in-the-course-of does not entail a temporal limitation,

12

that it doesn't --

13

First, courts have uniformly held that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think it -- wasn't the

14

word during the "commission" of?

15

of or during the commission of?

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Is it -- in the course

In -- in -In 16(b).
In 16(b), the phrase that

19

the government is speaking of is "in the course of

20

committing the offense."

21

And so, just to -- to continue that first

22

answer, courts have held that inchoate offenses of the

23

sort that -- that Justice Kagan was asking about, or

24

possession offenses, do create the risk, and

25

appropriately so, because -- or let's take another

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

example that -- that consumed a lot of time today:

2

Burglary.

3

Justice Kagan's question about burglary.

4

Notably, that is why in Leocal this Court held that

5

burglary did -- was sort of the classic example of a

6

16(b) violent crime.

7

Johnson, it's complete at the moment you cross the

8

threshold.

9

when are the elements completed, entering with the bad

Burglary, as this Court said in

If all we are looking at is the temporal, so

10

intent is what completes the elephant -- the -- the

11

elements.

So if someone enters, they have completed the

12

elements.

They can then ransack the apartment for the

13

next five hours.

14

committing the offense.

15

That is still in the course of

Second answer, the government's new

16

interpretation does not change the fundamentally

17

imaginary nature of the inquiry, no matter what.

18

will still be imagining the ordinary case.

20

when are the elements typically satisfied?

Courts

Only now you

And, finally, that textual difference is not

22

actually a textual difference.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

course, courts and legislatures always have to imagine

Official - Subject to Final Review

consequences when they are classifying crimes.

2

have to define what burglary is, because they know that

3

in a significant number of cases certain consequences

4

will happen.

5

They

That -- that's the way the law works.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, of course, Your Honor.

6

And if this were just to the question that Justice Alito

7

asked Mr. Kneedler about ramifications, if this is -- if

8

this were just about importing 16(b) into the

9

definitions of various crimes, there's no vagueness

10

problem, because as this Court said in Johnson -- and it

11

addressed exactly that question in Johnson, it's a

12

totally different inquiry when -- when you are applying

13

the stated elements to an actual concrete example that

14

is there before the Court.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Rosenkranz, could I ask

16

you this:

17

any person who commits a crime of moral turpitude in the

18

District of Columbia or with -- within the special or

19

maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United

20

States shall be imprisoned for not more than 20 years,

21

would that be unconstitutionally vague?

22

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Suppose Congress enacted a statute that said

Your Honor, it would

23

certainly be problematic.

24

problematic is because you don't have an administrative

25

agency that then gives content to the moral turpitude

And the reason it would be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32

language the way you do, for example, in the immigration

2

context.

3

deference is owed.

4

is a criminal statute --

And by the way, an agency to -- to which

5

But this is a statute, 16(b), that

JUSTICE ALITO:

But that seems to me -- I

6

mean, I'm surprised by -- somewhat surprised by your

7

answer.

8

16(b).

9

you rely was that that -- that a -- a deportation

That seems to me to be at least as vague as
And yet the holding in the Jordan case on which

10

statute that permitted deportation for a person

11

convicted of a crime of moral turpitude satisfied the

12

applicable vagueness standard there.

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So --

Well, yes, Justice Alito.

14

And -- and that's -- so that is the distinction.

15

today, moral turpitude -- "moral turpitude" is a phrase

16

that the -- the executive agency has defined.

17

know what it means.

18

what's out.

19

So

People

They know what's in, and they know

JUSTICE ALITO:

But, I mean, unless you're

20

willing to say that the criminal statute that I

21

hypothesized would satisfy vagueness standards, I -- I

22

don't see how you can say that the same vagueness

23

standard applies in criminal cases and deportation

24

cases.

25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, the same

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

vagueness standard does apply in -- in the two contexts,

2

but --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

So why does crime -- then

4

the statute making a crime of saying anyone who commits

5

a crime of moral turpitude sentenced to 20 -- up to 20

6

years, that would be -- that would satisfy vagueness for

7

a criminal statute?

8
9
10

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

In a criminal statute, it

would not, because there is no history of agency
interpretations to which courts must defer.

11

But let me just back up for a moment.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

But let me

22

just back up, because Your Honor has moved into the

23

second issue.

24
25

I just want to be clear that, in our view
and in the view of all of the lower courts, Jordan

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34

settles the question on whether it's the same standard

2

for criminal deportation.

3

to embrace Jordan or even address the question whether

4

it's the same standard.

5

that Congress chose to import wholesale into the

6

immigration laws and that -- that has criminal

7

applications even under the INA.

8

But this Court does not have

16(b) is a criminal statute

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Johnson talked a lot

9

about the confusion caused by the predicate offenses

10

that were -- were listed; in fact, in colorful terms

11

explained why those compounded the vagueness in the

12

residual clause.

13

here.

14

And, of course, you don't have those

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

So -- so

15

I would start with where -- with where Justice Kennedy

16

started, which is, as a general matter, one does not

17

ordinarily think that giving examples makes something

18

more vague than it would otherwise be.

19

And I know this Court spent a lot of time

20

trying to draw lessons from those examples with

21

varying -- with -- actually with no success under

22

varying methodologies to try to narrow the -- what is

23

otherwise a vague statute.

24

argument in Johnson was that -- that Congress succeeded

25

in narrowing with those enumerated elements, those

And the government's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

enumerated crimes, and this Court concluded that it

2

didn't.

3

But a statute that has examples, even if

4

they are confusing examples, has to be better than a

5

statute that is --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but the

7

statute as a whole might be because you can look at it

8

and say, well, there's one of the examples.

9

seems to me that argument doesn't respond to the point

But it

10

that it makes the residual clause much more confusing if

11

the examples seem to be pointing in different directions

12

and -- and involve different -- totally different

13

consequences.

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

Right.
Basically, what the

Court held in Johnson.

17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -So the fact that,

19

yes, it's clear when you get to the specific thing

20

that's named, but that, as the Court explained, it makes

21

it much more confusing -- confusing when you get to the

22

residual clause.

23

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So -- so I think the -- the

24

easiest way to look at this, I would say, is if that --

25

if that had been the pivotal factor in Johnson -- so

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

Johnson says there are two factors that conspired.

2

it had been indeed that other factor, what this Court

3

should have done in Johnson is to say, we will now, as a

4

matter of statutory construction, stop trying to draw

5

lessons from those examples and interpret the residual

6

clause in its own right without trying to figure out

7

whether the examples teach something about the

8

relationships.

9

If

This Court had an obligation to save the

10

statute if that's what was causing the problem.

11

didn't.

12

conscious of what it was doing when it said that there

13

14

elements that conspired to make the statute vague.

15

It

And I think it was -- this Court was very

And then in Welch, when this Court repeated

16

what its holding was and its rationale was in Johnson,

17

it repeated those same two critical elements, not this

18

third one about the enumerated clause.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I see that.

The thing

20

underlying this is -- which is a difficult case -- if we

21

say you're right, what then do we say about moral

22

turpitude, unfair competition, just and reasonable

23

rates, public convenience and necessity, and there are a

24

hundred others and they're all civil.

25

Now, what you've suggested is -- well, what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37

you say is this.

2

the creation of an administrative agency which will

3

develop a tradition over time that will clarify, but

4

will otherwise -- that kind of reasoning was present in

5

the nondelegation doctrine.

6

that which would -- that which would have saved a

7

statute under the nondelegation doctrine, which is not

8

fair competition, it's delegation of unriot, but which

9

is -- gives meaning is also necessary to save a civil

You say that the Constitution requires

statute from vagueness.

11

Hmm.

That's a very interesting holding.

12

I'd rather read it in a law review article than I would

13

write those words which will suddenly become real.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I'm not -- I'm not -- do

16

you see where I'm floating on this?

point, it's quite similar, but I quite worry about the

18

implications.

19

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I -- I see your

Well, Your Honor, so

20

let's -- so let's talk about the immigration that's

21

in -- excuse me -- the implications that is in the

22

immigration context to begin with.

23

In the immigration context, to the extent

24

that Your Honor -- that you are quoting, Justice Breyer,

25

from --

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm

happy to be confused with him.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

5

I was quoting Cordoza.

I confuse you all the time

with him.

6

So to the extent that we're focusing on

7

language that appears in the immigration statutes, that

8

language has been interpreted.

9

distinction between this case and Mahler, for example,

10

And that is a key

with -- with -- which Mr. Kneedler invoked.

11

Mahler was a situation in which Congress had

12

defined the crimes that would make you deportable.

13

the problem was that the Attorney General could then

14

exercise discretion as to whether he would deport you or

15

not.

16

it was pre-Chevron and pre-Schechter Poultry.

17

Court said, no, the fact that there is discretion

18

doesn't bother us.

19

And

And it was couched in terms of delegation because
But this

Now, the second answer is in the immigration

20

context, as distinguished from perhaps any other

21

context, as Justice Sotomayor was saying, the

22

immigration context in particular is a context that

23

implicates liberty with the severest sorts of

24

consequences.

25

context, completely apart from the public good sorts of

questions and applications of civil --

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Rosenkranz, I guess I

3

would have thought that your answer would have been

4

different.

5

answer would have been whatever implications Johnson had

6

for Vagueness Doctrine, it has already had, and that all

7

you are asking us to do is just essentially to say that

8

this statute is no different from the statute that we

9

looked at in Johnson and to write an opinion that

I guess I would have thought that your

10

basically just repeats Johnson.

11

implications it's had or it will have, it will have

12

regardless, and this opinion would do nothing more.

13
14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And whatever

Thank you, Your Honor.

Yes.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

What she said.
I mean, if that's your

18

answer, it totally ignores that this is not a criminal

19

case.

20

more severe consequences than the typical civil case.

21

But there are many other civil cases that can have a

22

devastating impact on someone, such as child custody,

23

loss of a professional license, complete destruction of

24

a business, loss of the home.

25

is some sort of vagueness standard that applies in civil

And it certainly is true that deportation has

Now, assuming that there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

cases, I would have thought your answer would be that

2

it's a sliding scale and that the -- the standard for

3

civil cases is not the same as the standard for criminal

4

cases.

5

civil context depends on the severity of the

6

consequences of the case.

7

But how much specificity is required in the

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, so, Justice Alito,

8

this Court in Hoffman said that it's a sliding scale.

9

But in Jordan, when it came to deportation, which this

10

Court has described as the gravest sort of consequence

11

which directly implicates liberty interests, this Court

12

said it's at the same level as --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

That's not exactly the

14

way the Court -- what the Court said, or at least it's

15

not necessary to read Jordan that way.

16

can be read to say, look, the dissent has raised this

17

new argument, it wasn't briefed, it wasn't argued.

18

dissent says this is unconstitutionally vague; we are

19

going to apply the criminal standard here and it

20

satisfies the criminal standard.

21

assume for the sake of argument, but I think it can

22

certainly be read that way.

23

that way, you are stuck with a conclusion that a statute

24

making a crime of moral turpitude punishable by a felony

25

term of imprisonment would satisfy the vagueness

I think Jordan

The

It -- it didn't say

And if you don't read it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

standard for a criminal statute, which I think is very

2

difficult to defend.

3

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, let me

4

say, again, two things.

5

doesn't have to decide whether Jordan equated criminal

6

cases and civil cases with the most severe consequences,

7

because this is a criminal statute that this Court is

8

interpreting and it has criminal consequences even as

9

imported through the INA.

10

The first thing, this Court

And I just --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, would you say the same

11

thing if it didn't -- if this statute did not

12

incorporate a definition that is also used in criminal

13

statutes and simply had the same standard in a purely

14

immigration statute?

15

definition that also applies in criminal cases.

16

So no reference to a -- a

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I would have a different

17

argument.

18

said -- and it said in A.B. Small.

19

that was held unconstitutional -- and this was back in

ramifications here as well.

But let me just maybe clear, this Court has

about that statement in Leocal, which was obviously -- I

That is an actual case that applied it in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's why this case

didn't work under 16(a) and the elements, right?

15

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

And then you bring me to another point that's really

17

important.

18

question about under the government's current view of

19

what 16(b) means where the space is between the elements

20

clause and the residual clause.

21

Mr. Kneedler never answered Justice Kagan's

I'm actually having trouble coming up with

22

an example of a situation of a -- of a scenario in which

23

a crime does not satisfy the elements clause, because

24

there is no element that requires the use or threat or

25

attempt to use force, but on the other hand,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

lawfully.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If I understood what he was

12

saying, and I won't try to put words in his mouth, but

13

it was something along the lines that, yes, it's true

14

that the elements of burglary do not have the use of

15

force.

16

understanding of burglary, what we find is a

17

longstanding concern with exactly that subject.

18

other words, that burglary wouldn't have been defined as

19

it was, wouldn't have been prosecuted as it was, except

20

for this fear of the use of force.

21

that's the best I can do with it and he will tell me if

22

he can do better.

But if we look back to the historic

11

What is the principle of

No

A.B. Small holds that, but it holds

So what is the principle of law that it
stands for?

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, the principle

13

of law that A.B. Small stands for that I was arguing

14

specifically, is the principle of law that when a court

15

strikes a statute that Congress has made the decision to

16

impose civil and criminal consequences to, that statute

17

is gone and you don't start preserving the civil

18

consequences to it, because Congress made the decision

19

and we just follow Congress's direction.

20

I do want to close with one last point,

21

which is about the practical consequences of this

22

ruling.

23

the practical consequences are very limited, because as

24

this Court observed in Johnson, practically all of the

25

applications of 16(b) are applied to a concrete set of

of the notion that this Court has not decided a lot of

3

16(b) cases, should this Court try to engage in the same

4

exercise in the 16(b) context that was a failure in the

ACCA -- in the ACCA context.

Then the question becomes what, in light -- what
