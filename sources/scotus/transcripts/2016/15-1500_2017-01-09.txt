CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Miller.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9
10

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In an individual capacity action against a

11

government employee, the plaintiff seeks relief from the

12

employee personally.

13

against the government.

14

does not implicate sovereign immunity.

15

repeatedly applied that principle to individual capacity

16

actions against federal and state employees, and it

17

applies equally when the defendant is an employee of an

18

Indian tribe.

19

The judgment is not enforceable
For that reason, such an action
This Court has

In advocating the contrary rule, respondent

20

takes the position that plaintiffs who have had no

21

connection to an Indian tribe whatsoever who were

22

injured as a result of a tribal employee's negligence in

23

carrying on a commercial activity miles away from a

24

reservation should have no remedy except whatever the

25

tribe chooses to provide in tribal court.

Alderson Reporting Company

That position

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

represents an extraordinary and unwarranted expansion of

2

tribal immunity.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They say it's the same as

4

if it were federal employee, then you would have the

5

Westfall Act.

6

have the same regime, and the tribe says, "And we do the

7

same thing."

8

sue in federal court under the Westfall Act --

9

Connecticut court under the Connecticut Act, and you can

10

If it was a state employee, you would

You can sue in our court just as you could

sue in our court.

11

MR. MILLER:

Well, and when a claim arises,

12

you know, within the reservation that is subject to the

13

tribe's legislative and adjudicatory jurisdiction, then

14

the tribe has the authority to define how that claim

15

shall be handled.

16

But here, we're talking about a claim that

17

arose under Connecticut law from an accident on a

18

Connecticut highway not on the reservation, and the

19

tribe does not have the authority to define the process

20

for handling that claim.

21

law.

22

That's subject to Connecticut

So the -- the analogy, I think, that they're

23

trying to draw is if you had an employee of one state

24

who, you know, was involved in an accident in a

25

different state -- and there are a lot of reasons that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

situation isn't really analogous, but even taking it on

2

its own terms, the forum state has jurisdiction over

3

that case.

4

doesn't have to send the -- send the plaintiffs off to

5

file in -- in the state of -- that the employee was

6

from.

7

The forum state can resolve that.

It

So there -- what the -- what the respondent

8

is asking for here is a sort of immunity, a sort of

9

ability to control how the litigation proceeds that is

10

unlike what any other state would enjoy.

11

briefing --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And in his

There is one flaw there.

13

Under our decision in Hyatt, Clarke would have been

14

entitled to the immunity that Connecticut gave its own

15

officials.

16
17

MR. MILLER:

Well, there are a couple of

antecedent questions there, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

MR. MILLER:

20

So, one, Hyatt is about the

full faith and credit clause, which applies --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. MILLER:

23

I agree.

Hyatt does not --

-- only to states and not --

not tribes.

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

MR. MILLER:

-- the tribes.

Hyatt is also about an action

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

against a state agency and not an individual capacity

2

action against a state employee.

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're absolutely true.

We haven't extended Hyatt that far yet.

5

MR. MILLER:

But even granting both of those

6

extensions of the decision, the rule in -- in Hyatt is

7

that the State cannot treat another state worse than it

8

would treat itself.

9

So if you applied the analogy here, you

10

would say that Connecticut has a regime in which an

11

action against a state employee is barred, but instead

12

you sue the state directly.

13

So applying that here, you would say, well,

14

we can't sue Mr. Clarke, so instead we get to sue the

15

tribe.

16

tribe is not willing to subject itself to jurisdiction

17

in Connecticut.

18

immunity in Connecticut courts.

19

asking for application of that principle of Hyatt; it's

20

asking for something quite a bit more.

21

it is asking for is the authority to legislate for how

22

litigation arising out of vehicle accidents off the

23

reservation in the state of Connecticut shall be

24

handled, and that's an authority --

25

But the tribe doesn't want that because the

The tribe has not waived its sovereign

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the tribe is not

And it's -- what

Well, just -- just so I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

understand the case:

2

sue in the tribal court, the rule would have been that

3

there is indemnity from the tribe.

4

negligence had been shown, then I assume there would be

5

recovery against the tribe?

If this plaintiff had elected to

6

MR. MILLER:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

And if there -- if

The -- the tribe -- yeah, yes.
I mean, we can take the

case on that assumption.

9

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

The tribe has a

10

procedure, not identical to what's available in state

11

court and much more limited in some ways, but it does

12

have a procedure that allows recovery against the tribe

13

in tribal court had the plaintiffs chosen to invoke

14

that.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

though; right?

17

punitive damages.

18

Well, very limited

I mean, there's a significant cap on

MR. MILLER:

Well, that's -- but punitive

19

damages are not available at all.

20

are -- are capped at twice the amount of actual damages,

21

which is a cap that doesn't exist in Connecticut either

22

for actions against a private party or even for actions

23

against the state.

24

a shorter statute of limitations.

25

There's no right to trial by jury.

Noneconomic damages

There's a much shorter -- or there's

Alderson Reporting Company

It's only one year.
So there are a

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

number of both procedural and substantive differences.

2

That's correct, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

When -- when there is a suit

4

against an entity like the Port Authority of New York

5

and New Jersey and the question is whether that is

6

really a -- a suit -- whether that is a suit against one

7

of the states and, therefore, subject to sovereign

8

immunity, we would look to see who would pay the

9

judgment.

10
11
12

So that's Mr. Katyal's argument.
Why wouldn't we do the same -- why should we

not do the same thing when it is against an employee?
MR. MILLER:

When -- when you have a

13

state-created agency like -- like the Port Authority,

14

the Court looks at a number of factors to assess whether

15

that agency should be treated as essentially the State

16

or as some distinct entity, and you're right.

17

the factors is financial responsibility.

18

One of

But the Court has never applied that

19

analysis in assessing whether a -- a natural person who

20

is not a creation of State law --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why shouldn't we?

I

22

mean, you suggest the difference is because this is a

23

voluntary agreement.

24

that if the State pays, we should understand it to be a

25

suit against the State.

But why shouldn't it be the rule

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1
2

MR. MILLER:

Well, there -- a couple of --

that would be inconsistent with a number of decisions.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -- I think you're right,

4

Mr. Miller.

5

say something like that.

6

why wouldn't that be a sensible rule?

7

I think we would have to change our law to

MR. MILLER:

I'm just asking, like what --

Well, for one thing, it's not a

8

sensible rule because as a -- immunity is a question

9

that ought to be decided, as this Court has said many

10

times, at the threshold of a litigation.

11

be able to look at the pleadings and see is this suit

12

against the State or is it against somebody other than

13

the State.

14

and we don't proceed further.

15

You ought to

And if it is, immunity bars the suit and --

Indemnification is not always so easy to

16

tell at the outset.

17

provides for indemnification except in cases of reckless

18

conduct.

19

but we also haven't had any discovery and it may be that

20

facts will emerge in the course of discovery that would

21

establish that Mr. Clarke had been reckless at the time

22

of the accident, and then, even on Respondent's theory,

23

that the indemnification obligation would disappear and

24

so would immunity.

25

The tribal code, for example,

In this case, we haven't alleged recklessness,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So those kinds of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

considerations haven't prevented us from looking to

2

who's ultimately going to pay the bills in the kinds of

3

cases that Justice Alito was talking about.

4

MR. MILLER:

Well, when -- when you're

5

talking about a -- a sort of state-created entity, you

6

know, but the State is itself an artificial legal

7

construct and so there has to be some test for figuring

8

out, you know, whether some other artificial legal

9

construct is a different entity or the same entity.

10

But that's just not how we think about it

11

with real-live people who are not the State.

12

necessarily something different.

13

Respondent's theory that indemnification of the officer

14

makes the officer the State, if that were right, then,

15

as we noted in the brief, there are many States that by

16

statute indemnify all of their employees and a 1983

17

damages actions against employees in any of those States

18

would implicate the Eleventh Amendment.

19

Court's decision in Hafer v. Melo would be what you

20

would have to go the other way in all of those States.

21

And not only has this Court never held that, so far as

22

we're aware, no court has ever even suggested that as a

23

possibility.

24
25

They're

And I -- if

And this

We also see the converse of this -- of this
issue in -- in this Court's decision in Regents of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

University of California v. Doe, where the defendant was

2

the University of California and it was subject to a --

3

an indemnification obligation from the Department of

4

Energy, and the plaintiff said, correctly, you know, the

5

university does not face any real financial liability

6

here.

7

government is going to pay.

8

held that Eleventh Amendment's immunity still applies

9

because the suit was won against the State.

You know, whatever happens, the Federal
But the Court nonetheless

10

And so the -- the crucial question -- that's

11

what the Court said in Larson -- the crucial question is

12

whether the relief sought in a suit addressed to the

13

officer is actually relief against the sovereign.

14

You -- you look at what the relief is that's being

15

sought and not the -- the more difficult to determine

16

question of where the economic loss might or might not

17

ultimately fall at the end of all the proceedings.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could a State give greater

19

immunity to an Indian tribe than is available under

20

Federal law?

21
22
23

MR. MILLER:

As a matter of State law, yes,

a State could choose to do that.
JUSTICE ALITO:

And the State --

So the Connecticut supreme

24

court could do that if it wanted to?

25

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

I mean, we would -- we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

would urge it not -- not to do so and we'd also argue

2

that an argument for doing so in this case has not been

3

preserved.

4

any impediment to the State choosing to do that.

5

But as a matter of State law, we don't see

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose this -- the

6

driver of the vehicle was not working for the -- for an

7

Indian tribe, but instead was an employee of a foreign

8

embassy.

9

immunity, sovereign immunity, would stop the suit?

10

In -- in that case, am I right that the

MR. MILLER:

No, Your Honor, it would not.

11

So a -- a suit against -- if you're saying a suit

12

against the individual employee --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

-- who was driving a car,

15

our -- the -- the test set out in -- in the second

16

restatement is that that would not be barred by official

17

immunity.

18

immunity either, because it's not a suit against the

19

sovereign.

20

It certainly wouldn't be barred by sovereign

Now, I have to say there aren't a lot of

21

cases, certainly not recently, in which individual

22

employees of foreign governments have been sued in this

23

situation, and that's because, in this situation, you

24

could sue the foreign government directly under the

25

FSIA.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

In this case, the -- if the foreign

2

government were operating a casino in Connecticut, you

3

could just sue them directly under the commercial

4

activity exception, and if for reason that didn't apply,

5

the -- the domestic tort exception.

6

the United States by the foreign government is not

7

subject to foreign sovereign immunity.

8

10

A tort committed in

So it -- it is our understanding that you
could sue the employee and then certainly you could sue
the foreign government.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is it always the case that

12

the plaintiff simply gets to choose whether it wants to

13

proceed in an individual capacity or in an official

14

capacity, or are there constraints at all on that

15

choice?

16

MR. MILLER:

The -- well, the constraints

17

are that in certain circumstances an official capacity

18

suit is going to be barred by sovereign immunity, but --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

MR. MILLER:

No, right.

But -- but --

In framing -- in framing the

21

complaint, it's up to the plaintiff to decide what

22

relief he or she wants to seek and from whom.

23

and that's really what defines the -- the capacity in

24

which the officer is being sued.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

And --

What about an

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

Edelman v. Jordan type situation?

2

the individual who's in charge of disbursing the funds

3

of the tribe and pursue -- proceed just against the

4

individual, it's still going to be regarded as a suit

5

against the sovereign.

6

MR. MILLER:

I mean, if you name

Well, that's because in -- in

7

Edelman -- I guess the -- the -- the fuller answer to

8

the question would be that the plaintiff gets to choose,

9

but the way they choose is by the relief that they're

10

seeking, not just the label that they attach.

11

So in -- in Edelman, I mean, whatever the

12

plaintiff may have chosen to call that, the action --

13

the -- the relief that was sought was the payment of

14

welfare benefits or disability benefits.

15

Mr. Edelman didn't have the benefits personally and then

16

couldn't pay them personally.

17

sought was, you know, directing Mr. Edelman to use his

18

authority as an officer of the State to pay the benefits

19

out of the State treasury, and -- and because of the

20

relief bound the State, that was an official capacity

21

action.

22

You know,

But the relief that was

So it -- it's defined by -- it's not just a

Recognizing the broader

description of the remedy-sought analysis contained in

9

Maxwell, that if the suit is seeking not just public

10

funds but affects the public administration or requires

11

the tribe to do something, it's still --

12

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

The -- the -- well,

13

the -- I mean, the test is -- you know, is the officer

14

being compelled to do something on behalf of the tribe

15

or is he being compelled to do something just as a -- a

16

private person who happens to be an employee of -- of

17

the tribe?

18

Connecticut supreme court thought; the -- the question

19

of in what capacity was he acting at the time of the

20

events that gave rise to the litigation.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

It turns on -- on that question, not as the

What -- what do you think

22

-- maybe you're going to get to this.

23

of the official immunity idea that the government puts

24

forward?

25

MR. MILLER:

What do you think

Well, the -- the first thing we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

think about that is that it is not before the Court.

2

The question presented as stated both in the petition

3

and in Respondent's brief in our position referred only

4

to sovereign immunity.

5

The only issue that was addressed below was

6

sovereign immunity.

7

below was sovereign immunity, and -- and, indeed,

8

Respondent's argument below was essentially that what --

9

what he said to the Connecticut supreme court was

The only argument that was made

10

they're really suing the tribe, they're not really suing

11

me.

12

This is just a trick of pleading.
So that's an argument that not only is not

13

an official immunity argument, it's really inconsistent

14

with the idea of an immunity that would apply in a --

15
16
17

JUSTICE ALITO:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. O'CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Petitioners' suit is a personal-capacity

24

suit against an individual tribal employee, and the

25

tribe sovereign immunity is therefore not implicated.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

The Connecticut supreme court reached the

2

opposite conclusion by holding that a tribe's sovereign

3

immunity extends to any of its employees acting within

4

the scope of his employment, even if the plaintiff seeks

5

damages against that employee personally.

6

is contrary to the settled rule; that distinguishing

7

between a personal-capacity suit and an

8

official-capacity suit depends on the capacity in which

9

the employee is sued, not the capacity in which he acted

10

That holding

when he inflicted the alleged harm.

11

It particularly makes sense that tribal

12

As I was reading your brief, I was trying to figure that

out.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -Because you're basically

announcing a rule that in individual-capacity suits,

sovereign immunity is not implicated unless the remedy

21

sought implicates the tribe directly.

22
23
24
25

What else could we write that would preclude
official immunity?
MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, I think, Justice

Sotomayor, these -- as you can tell from the Connecticut

supreme court's decision in this case and the cases

cited therein, these two concepts often confused or

conflated with one another in lower courts.

just wanted to be absolutely clear what we think the

5

United States' view is on each of those separate

6

questions so that the Court -- you know, so that the

Court wouldn't write anything in a tribal sovereign

immunity opinion that would affect official immunity.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so we

Do you think that might have

happened here in the court below, in the Connecticut

11

courts, that those two concepts were confused?

12

MS. O'CONNELL:

The Connecticut supreme

14

definitely decided this case as a matter of tribal

sovereign immunity.

As far as I understand it, this was a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, Mr. Clarke is

7

arguing that if you're going to go back to the common

law official immunity doctrine, that covered, as our

Westfall case indicated, even nondiscretionary acts;

10

that it covered every act.

11

that?

12
13

MS. O'CONNELL:

16

Westfall said the opposite.

So the -- the case they're looking to is Barr v. Mateo.

15

What's your position on

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

I confused

the cases.

said that view of what the Federal common law provided

was a mistaken reading of Barr v. Mateo.

MS. O'CONNELL:

I think that's correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, one reason it

11

might be a difficult proposition is that the Court has

12

suggested several times that there is some uneasiness

13

with the doctrine of applying sovereign immunity to

14

tribal entities at all.

15

Does the government have a position on that?

16

MS. O'CONNELL:

The -- well, we think

17

it's -- it's settled at this point that tribal sovereign

18

19

applies to commercial activities, including

20

off-reservation commercial activities.

21

The Court suggested in Bay Mills that there

22

may be an exception to tribal sovereign immunity if

23

there were some circumstance in which a -- like, a tort

24

victim or a person with no connection to the tribe,

25

which is the Petitioners here, had no remedy for their

MR. KATYAL:

Easy, Justice Alito, and that

MR. KATYAL:

But

You couldn't actually, Justice

Ginsburg, because the Federal Drivers Act in 1961

forbade that.

And so that was --

MR. KATYAL:
that's right.

But as our brief explains, after Barr v.

10

Mateo, lower court after lower court said the -- said

11

that official immunity extends to nondiscretionary

12

functions.

13

Justice Ginsburg, this Court said that it was limited to

14

discretionary functions, but Congress quickly repudiated

15

that and said that the Court got it actually wrong

and --

And in the Westfall decision, to be sure,

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- that -- that's a

you -- and you begin by saying, oh, this is a pleading

maneuver --

You're asking us, in effect, to do

MR. KATYAL:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Uh-huh.
-- which is, I think, a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33

demeaning professional comment.

2

is following the rules that were very clearly explained

3

in the government's brief and in the -- and in the

sovereign immunity and official immunity.

difference.

MR. KATYAL:

That's the

Justice Kennedy -But you want to say that

11

what you want us to do is to pass a little Westfall Act

12

up here.

13
14

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Kennedy, three -- three

responses.

15

First of all, we certainly didn't mean to

16

deride them professionally or otherwise.

17

up on this Court's own language in saying that it's the

18

substance that controls the forum, which it's used in

19

many of the immunity cases.

We're picking

20

Second, on response to the question about

21

whether we're asking this Court to do Congress's work

22

for it, no.

23

more than what is done in the foreign tort -- in the

24

Federal Tort Claims Act, cases like Boyle, for example.

25

Justice Kennedy, the very argument that you made was

We're actually asking this Court to do no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

made by the dissent by Justice Brennan, but you joined

2

Justice Scalia's opinion, which said that just because

3

the text of the act didn't cover Federal contractors --

4

and even though the Federal contractor lobbied --

5

lobbied behind -- lobbied Congress for actually an

6

extension to the act for the immunity, what this Court

7

said is, our job as a court in interpreting Federal

8

common law is to look to the wisdom embodied in

9

statutes.

10

And just because Congress didn't connect the

11

dots and apply the law to Federal contractors, it only

12

applied it to Federal employees, the Court said, that's

13

what we should do here.

14

say the same thing, which is it's the job of the Court

15

to try and look to the wisdom --

And cases like Willis in 1966

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. KATYAL:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

-- of the statutes.
But my understanding, which

19

Justice Ginsburg said, is that, basically -- the

20

Westfall Act is a complicated act, but, basically, if

21

you're rear-ended by a postal employee, you can sue the

22

government of the United States.

23

victim of an accident has recourse.

24
25

So a person who's the

Now, my guess would be that states do
something similar, because it seems to me very odd that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

if I'm rear-ended or run over by some kind of State car

2

which has a State driver that there's no remedy at all.

3

MR. KATYAL:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. KATYAL:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely.
There is a remedy.

I'm sorry if I misspoke.
Yeah.

But absolutely you'd have a

8

remedy against the State itself, just not against the

9

employee.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

But here what we

11

have is there is no remedy against the tribe.

12

that's why I thought it would be odd to say there's no

13

remedy at all.

14

seemed to be that you could sue the employee, but not

15

the State.

And, therefore, the basic principle

16

MR. KATYAL:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

And

So, Justice -And then they changed that

through legislation.

So, Justice Breyer, we think

20

that that's absolutely not true; that is, there is a

2

MR. KATYAL:

That's absolutely right.

But I

3

think the important point and what our brief says and

4

what the NACI brief joined by Texas and four other

5

states representing, you know, a bunch of tribes is that

6

the way to deal with that is the compact process.

7

is -- and this goes to your question earlier, Justice

8

Kennedy, about whether states have protections in this

9

area.

10

That

The remedy -- the -- the parade of

11

hypotheticals is dealt with by the fact that you can't

12

actually -- we couldn't even gamble in Connecticut,

13

couldn't set up this operation without Connecticut first

14

agreeing in a compact voluntarily to having this, and in

15

the course of that compact, they said, criminal

retain it.

And so this exactly -JUSTICE ALITO:

The problem -- the problem

21

with that argument is that it -- it seems to suggest

22

that the State's motive will be to provide protection

23

for somebody like Mr. Clarke.

24

Connecticut has a very strong incentive to -- to be

25

solicitous of the interests of the Mohegan tribe because

But the State of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the State gets an enormous amount of revenue from this

2

casino.

3

Isn't that true?
MR. KATYAL:

But I -- I -- Justice Alito, I

4

understand the point, but I think that's true generally

5

in law; that is, we -- we rely on the State to -- to

6

make its own prerogatives and choices.

7

the State could decide not to have tort claims at all if

8

they wanted to -- not just against tribes, but against

9

anyone if they wanted to incentivize businesses in one

10

way or another.

11

that.

12

So, for example,

I don't think this Court gets into

Rather, I think the question, and as our

13

brief shows, State after State have actually done the

14

reverse, Justice Alito.

15

compacts that do things like channel this litigation

16

into State courts instead of tribal courts.

17

Mexico example at page 53 of our brief is a good

18

example.

19

Seventeen different States have

The New

Indeed, Justice Alito, in Connecticut

20

itself, Foxwood Casino, which is run by the Pequot

21

tribe, has the following statute, quote, "Any person

22

injured through the negligence of any Pequot tribe" --

23

"tribal employee, while acting within the scope of his

24

employment and while operating a motor vehicle, shall

25

have a right of action.

The tribe hereby expressly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

waives its immunity from suit for such claims provided

2

such suit is brought in the courts of the State of

3

Connecticut."

4

That's the way to deal with this, which is,

5

if a State's concerned about -- you know, about limit --

6

about not -- about tribal courts or anything like that,

7

they can do what many States have done, which is say,

8

hey, if you want to have gaming operations in our State,

9

you've got a first say and agree to waive sovereign

10

immunity in State court.

11

and now they're simply trying to relitigate the terms.

12

That's not what they did here,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that wouldn't help

13

Mr. Clarke -- that wouldn't help Mr. Lewis because --

14

well, it would help him.

15

but he wants to sue Mr. Clarke.

He could sue the -- the tribe,

16

MR. KATYAL:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18
19

Well -And so if the tribe's

waived sovereign immunity, why shouldn't the individual?
MR. KATYAL:

Justice Sotomayor, before the

20

lawsuit was brought, there was a preexisting statute

21

that -- of the tribe that says that they fully indemnify

22

Mr. Clarke, they pay all of the expenses and pay any

23

judgment that was rendered against him.

24

So anything in substance and --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So your sovereign

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

immunity argument relies solely on that --

2
3

MR. KATYAL:

Correct.

If -- if there were

no indemnification agreement or anything like that --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Indemnification in the

5

Bivens actions, you say oh, those are constitutional

6

actions.

7

the Constitution or laws of the United States.

I thought 1983 says violation of the law of

8

MR. KATYAL:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Correct.

And so --

But they are all

constitutional.

11

MR. KATYAL:

Correct.

If it's a State, it'd

12

be also ultra vires.

13

that is, if the Federal government passed some law that,

14

you know, provided a tort, you know, our argument does

15

not extend to that.

16

State law and the law of the tribe.

17

And same thing would be true here;

It only extends to a clash between

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So --

Is there any -- is there

18

any court that has held that an indemnification

19

agreement, agreement to indemnify the employee, extends

20

sovereign immunity to that employee?

21

MR. KATYAL:

So -- so this Court hasn't

22

reached that question.

23

have basically said -- for example, the Medicare cases

24

at page 19 of our brief are good examples, the Blue

25

Cross.

And the lower courts, I think,

So Blue Cross is administering a Federal program

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

and they -- and in the course of doing so, they get

2

sued, and the question that those cases are grappling

3

with is who is the real party in interest?

4

Cross get Federal -- get sovereign immunity?

5

answer that those courts give is yes.

6

Does Blue
And the

So we think you could look to those, Justice

7

Ginsburg, as well as looking to the indemnification

8

cases as I was saying to Justice -- the -- the

9

instrumentality cases as I was saying to Justice Alito.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the

11

indemnification in other contexts, does somebody --

12

you -- you couldn't have an indemnity agreement that

13

would count, let's say, for diversity of citizenship, it

14

would only be the parties.

15

You couldn't -- the indemnity agreement --

16

the party that indemnifies is not a necessary party

17

under Rule 19.

18

in interest to be the one who provides indemnity.

19

So we haven't considered the real party

MR. KATYAL:

To be sure, Justice Ginsburg,

20

in joinder and -- and in things like that, I think

21

that's right, but I don't think that is -- those are

22

private party litigation cases.

23

I think if this Court's asking for what's

24

the best analogy to this situation here, which is a

25

sovereign-immunity situation, I think the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

instrumentality cases are -- are quite a bit closer than

2

the ones like joinder and the like, which don't have

3

anything to do with immunity at all.

4

In case after case, starting with Ford

5

Motor, this Court has been asking the question, who is

6

the real party in interest for purposes of sovereign

7

immunity.

8

not, you know, some sort of lawyer -- you know, we're

9

not being -- trying to denigrate them, but the fact is,

Here, the real party in interest -- this is

10

in practical effect, the judgment here is against the

11

tribe.

12

responsible for all the costs, all the judgment and so

13

on.

14

want to sue Clarke, but in practical effect they're not

15

suing Clarke.

There was a statute of the tribe that said we're

And, yes, Justice Sotomayor, they might say they

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So how do we deal

17

with this.

18

Indemnify everybody.

19

as soon as you do that, nobody can sue you.

20

therefore, the tribe is totally immune from the most

21

ordinary accidents taking place off the reservation, and

22

the victim of now these missiles being sent out from the

23

reservation because they run over people and there's no

24

remedy at all.

25

Every tribe passes this.

You say great.

You'll never have to pay because
And so,

Now -- now that -- that seems to me pushing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

the notion of tribal sovereign immunity off the

2

reservation into a place where there are just no

3

remedies for victims at all.

4

that?

5

MR. KATYAL:

Now, what is the answer to

The answer to that is in our

6

brief.

7

the extent a tribe is kind of creating a shell game in

8

saying, oh, we're going to indemnify these people, but

9

then not pay the judgment or assert sovereign immunity

10

akin to some of the hypotheticals in the first hour of

11

the argument, the -- the last case that you were

12

hearing, absolutely those were cases in which lower

13

court after lower court, like the Ninth Circuit have

14

said, oh, that's a situation in which sovereign immunity

15

doesn't apply.

That's exactly right, Justice Breyer, that to

16

Now, you've said here, well, the fact that

17

it's commercial or off reservation matters, and that's

18

something that Mr. Miller said.

19

of course, didn't say that.

20

supreme court said at Petition Appendix page 10, but

21

they never made those types of arguments.

You know, below they,

That's what the Connecticut

22

But to the extent that they're troubling the

23

Court, I think the answer is what this Court has said in

24

Bay Mills and Kiowa, which is, tribal immunity is

25

different in that respect than maybe some other types of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

immunity; that is, it does extend to commercial

2

off-reservation activity.

3

reasons for that having to do with the fiscal base of

4

tribes and other things like that.

5

There are longstanding

This Court -- I don't think they're asking

6

this Court to try and relitigate Bay Mills or Kiowa.

7

You've decided it squarely twice.

8

flows very naturally from that.

9

An argument I think

Justice Kennedy, there was a third thing I

10

wanted to say in response to your long question before,

11

which is, you had said that -- and this is something

12

that the other side had said -- that the lower court had

13

relied only on sovereign immunity and not on official

14

immunity.

15

I don't think that that's quite right.

I

16

think that the lower court here, the Connecticut supreme

17

court, relied on -- basically conflated both doctrines,

18

and there's a -- I think, you know, that's the way

19

Connecticut courts have done this.

20

official immunity case about tribes in Connecticut

21

courts that we have been able to find except for one

22

mention in an unpublished opinion in --

23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
in your question presented?
MR. KATYAL:

Indeed, there is no

So why didn't you do it

Presumably, you're --

We -- we certainly should

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

have -- the brief in opposition, there's no doubt,

2

Justice Sotomayor, should have been clearer on this

3

point --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, your opening brief

5

on page 22, 23 says, we're not claiming any personal

6

immunity.

7
8
9
10

You know the difference.
MR. KATYAL:

I think -- I think that we --

we did say -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
MR. KATYAL:

Between official and --

In the -- in the brief in

11

opposition at page 1, we did say that if this -- that

12

the employee cases and the statutory cases support our

13

position, as well as at pages 14 and 15 of that --

14

and -- and 22 and 23 of that brief.

15

And I do think that that follows naturally

16

from the way the Connecticut courts have understood

17

this, which is to conflate both doctrines together,

18

official immunity and tribal immunity.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why don't we

20

unconflate them, send them back and tell them, answer

21

the two doctrines differently, because we've always

22

treated them differently.

23

MR. KATYAL:

Well -- right.

So we -- we

24

don't have a problem with that.

25

concern I'd have about that is exactly what Ms.

The one, I guess,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

O'Connell just said a few moments ago, which is, she

2

said that -- that the reason why -- she said, quote, "It

3

makes sense that tribal sovereign immunity does not

4

apply because official immunity does."

5

that view, that the reason why tribal sovereign immunity

6

doesn't apply is because of official immunity being

7

here, then I think you would have to get into that

8

question.

9

And if you take

We certainly think you should because we

10

think for 50 years, starting with the Davis decision in

11

1968, Federal courts have recognized immunity, sometimes

12

they call it tribal immunity, sovereign immunity.

13

Sometimes they call it official immunity, sometimes they

14

call it sovereign immunity.

15

here.

16

It doesn't actually matter

It does matter absolutely, Justice

17

Sotomayor, in the State context what label you put on

18

it, because if it's sovereign immunity, Congress can't

19

abrogate it, they have Eleventh Amendment protections.

20

But that's not true with respect to tribes; that is,

21

Congress's power is plenary, whether you call it

22

official immunity or sovereign immunity.

23

And so for that reason, we think the Court

24

should get into it here and -- and affirm what the

25

courts have said.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So Congress could have

enacted a Westfall Act covering tribes, but it didn't.

3

MR. KATYAL:

Correct, Justice Ginsburg.

4

That's exactly the argument this Court rejected in Boyle

5

and Justice Scalia's opinion, which is Congress was

6

lobbied to extend the Federal -- the Federal Tort Claims

7

Act except to federal contractors.

8

Court then did exactly that.

9

in Willis, quote, "If there's a Federal statute dealing

They didn't.

This

And as this Court has said

10

with the general subject, it's a primer pository of

11

Federal policy and a starting point for Federal common

12

law."

13

So Federal common law works differently than

14

the kind of expressio unius reading that I think the

15

other side and that's embodied in the premise to your

16

question.

17

answering Federal common law is -- in asking the Federal

18

common law question is:

19

this area?

20

between a tribal driver and a Federal driver or

21

something like that, absolutely, that's a fair -- that's

22

fair game.

23

I think the question for this Court in

What is Congress's judgment in

And if they can identify some distinction

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Federal driver never

24

had common law immunity.

25

statutory immunity, but it didn't -- the drivers didn't

It has under the Westfall Act

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

have common law immunity.

2

MR. KATYAL:

They didn't before 1961 as I

3

was -- as I was saying, but I do think the unbroken

4

tradition of the lower courts after Barr v. Matteo in

5

1959, is to give low level employees, nondiscretionary

6

employees, Federal -- Federal common law immunity.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we said that was

8

wrong.

9

defamation and kindred torts, not negligent driving.

10

In Westfall, we said that Barr applies to

MR. KATYAL:

Correct.

You did.

And you

11

also invited Congress, because you said, look, we're not

12

sure about this and we'd -- Congress, we'd like you to

13

act.

14

acted, they dramatically repudiated the notion that in

15

common law --

16

And then Congress did act.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And when Congress

You said repudiated.

17

They could have said, yeah, the Court got the -- the law

18

right, what -- what it was, but we think the law should

19

be changed, and not necessarily repudiating this Court's

20

reading of what the common law is.

21

MR. KATYAL:

I think that's actually in the

22

findings itself, Justice Ginsburg, of the act, as well

23

as the House report.

24

concurrence in Haley v. Osborn in 1988 which we quote,

25

because there Justice Breyer said that employees had,

It's also in Justice Breyer's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

quote, "received an immunity that applied to

2

nondiscretionary as well as discretionary actions before

3

the Westfall decision," and enacted the Westfall Act to,

4

quote, "maintain the scope of that pre-Westfall

5

immunity."

6

And so -JUSTICE ALITO:

Why should -- why should

7

a -- a tribal employee driving a limo be entitled to

8

official immunity?

9

immunity is to protect, quote, "the fearless, vigorous,

You say that the purpose of official

10

and effective administration of policies of government,"

11

but you -- you want to have -- you want to encourage

12

limo drivers on I-95 to be fearless in the way they

13

drive?

14

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I -- I think the -- the

15

first point is that their argument is so sweeping it

16

extends not just to drivers, it extends to tribal

17

judges, it extends to tribal prosecutors, and, yes, it

18

extends even to drivers of emergency vehicles.

19

Ninth Circuit and Tenth Circuit amicus brief talks about

20

police and fire and all sorts of tribal things in which

21

you actually would, Justice Alito, for sure, I think,

22

want them to be fearless in saving peoples' lives and

23

things like that.

24
25

The

And, yes, there are times there are rough
edges to any immunity doctrine in which you can say,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

well, in this case how is that policy being served.

2

mean take this Court's decision in Imbul v. Packman,

3

which had the, you know, grossest facts imaginable.

4

A -- you know, a state prosecutor who's fabricating

5

evidence, which this Court said unanimously that that

6

person was absolutely immune.

7

I

So I agree that there are going to be some

8

of those cases, but I think the logic of all of the

9

pre-Westfall decisions, as well as the Westfall Act, is

10

to say, we're not getting into that about -- you know,

11

as long as the person is a Federal employee, then they

12

have official immunity.

13

And here, as long as the person is a tribal

14

employee and as long as -- is -- and because the State

15

of Connecticut does have a remedy against any sort of

16

concerns, so if they were concerned about your situation

17

about fearless driving, they can do -- and negotiate in

18

the compact, as New Mexico has done, for something else

19

and say, look, we want this channeled into State court,

20

we insist that you waive immunity, there are a host of

21

remedies that are available to States in this

22

circumstance and, indeed, Connecticut availed themselves

23

of them in this compact.

24
25

And now what these folks are asking for is
to renegotiate that compact and ask for something up and

Alderson Reporting Company

beyond what the State of Connecticut has provided.

If there are no further questions?

consider the -- in which to consider the question of

13

official immunity.

question as to whether the tribe even has sovereign

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

immunity in that context.

2

need to resolve that question here, but that's an

3

additional reason to be cautious before reaching out and

4

creating a very broad rule of official immunity in these

5

circumstances.

6

And, again, you -- you don't

That leaves the question of indemnification

7

and whether indemnification somehow changes the

8

sovereign immunity analysis.

9

suggests that -- that the judgment here would somehow

The -- the Respondent

10

bind the tribe.

11

does not have the authority to issue a judgment that

12

binds the Mohegan tribe, because the -- the tribe --

because of the tribe's sovereign immunity.

14

Connecticut supreme court judgment will not do that.

15

The -- the Connecticut supreme court

But the

The Connecticut supreme court judgment will

16

bind Mr. Clarke separately.

17

to indemnify him, and that doesn't change the analysis

19

doesn't normally look at indemnification in figuring out

21

context.

22

24

Young does not authorize the relief of retrospective

25

rewards of damages.

The tribe may have agreed

Alderson Reporting Company

So, you know, if Respondent were right and

2

indemnification converted the action against the

3

employee into one against the State, then even under

4

Young, it wouldn't be permissible.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think, Mr. Miller,

6

that there's any decision that precludes us from saying

7

that we're going to treat this as sovereign immunity or

8

not sovereign immunity depending on an -- an

9

indemnification agreement?

10

MR. MILLER:

There's no case that directly

11

precludes you from saying that.

12

difficult to reconcile with the analysis in Regents of

13

the University of California v. Doe, and it would

14

also -- I think a holding to that effect, you know,

15

would be an intention with all of the cases -- you know,

16

all the 1983 cases from states that indemnify their

17

employees that have assumed the non -- the absence of

18

sovereign immunity.

19

It would be very

It would also be in considerable tension

20

with the analysis in diversity cases and -- and Rule 19

21

cases.

22

say you can't do that.

23

But there's nothing directly on point that would

Finally, as you pointed out, Justice Breyer,

24

allowing indemnification to create sovereign immunity

25

here would -- would have the very strange consequence

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

that, by allowing the tribe to come in and say well,

2

the -- the action against the employee is really against

3

us, we're going to have to pay, therefore immunity

4

applies, but now that immunity applies, we don't have to

5

pay, that allows the -- the liability to just simply

6

disappear --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I heard his argument.

8

I mean, he may not, I don't want to saddle him with

9

this, but common -- Federal common law, sovereign

10

immunity idea, and where a tribe -- let -- so let's look

11

at what the statutes do.

12

And we see every State and the Federal

13

government don't let you bring a suit against the

14

employee and make the employee pay for an automobile

15

accident.

Rather, they offer some other remedy.

16

You go against the State, for example, under

17

the Westfall Act, you go against the Federal government,

18

and so by analogy, where the tribe is, in fact, going to

19

pay and also offers a remedy, then, by analogy, that

20

latter part being important then, then, by analogy, the

21

Federal common law should be shaped to reflect.

22
23
24
25

I think that's basically the kind of thought
he's -- your opponent here is trying to put in my head.
MR. MILLER:
answers to that.

Yes, and -- and there are two

The -- the first is that as a factual

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

54
1

matter, in fact, not every State bars actions against

2

individual employees.

3

allow them and -- and then they indemnify the employee,

4

but you can sue the employee in his own name.

5

There are a number of states that

The more fundamental problem with that

6

argument from respondent is that the tribe may choose as

7

a matter of grace to provide a remedy in its court, but

8

this is a traffic accident on a public highway in

9

Connecticut.

And the victims of that accident, the

10

petitioners had a right under Connecticut law, to get

11

redress from the negligent party and they had a right to

12

go to a Connecticut court to seek that redress.

13

And the tribe can pass the statute, but the

14

tribe does not have the authority to reach out into the

15

state of Connecticut and take away Petitioners' state

16

law right from them.

17

We ask the judgment be reversed.

If there are no further questions.
