CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

4

this -- this morning in Case No. 15-827, Endrew F. v.

5

Douglas County School District.

6

Mr. Fisher.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The IDEA does not permit a school district

12

to provide a child with a disability a barely more than

13

de minimis educational benefit.

14

requires is for the school to provide instruction and

15

related services to the child that are reasonably

16

calculated to provide substantially equal educational

17

opportunities.

Rather, what the Act

18

The school district's primary response to

19

our argument is that the standard I just described to

20

you does not appear anywhere in the operative text of

21

the IDEA.

22

But let me get right to -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it also -- it

23

also didn't appear anywhere in the original petition,

24

did it?

25

opening brief where you note that substantial

I'm looking at Footnote 8 in your -- your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

educational benefit was the standard that was discussed

2

in the petition and then a significantly different one

3

in your -- your opening brief.

4

MR. FISHER:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we

5

don't intend it to be significantly different.

6

do intend, as we describe in that footnote, is to give

7

more detail as to how the standard works. I'd say --

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What we

The standard -- the

standard you're asking us to adopt, substantially equal

10

opportunity, that does appear someplace.

11

Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion in Rowley, and the

12

court itself did not adopt that formulation, did not

13

adopt substantially equal opportunity.

14

us to adopt a standard that the majority already had

15

before it and didn't adopt.

16

MR. FISHER:

It appears in

So you're asking

Justice Ginsburg, yes, Justice

17

Blackmun proposed a standard similar to the one that we

18

offered the Court today, but that was 1982.

19

Congress has amended the IDEA twice, in 1997 and in

20

2004.

21

describes the way the Act works with exactly the words

22

I'm giving you:

And

And in the findings and purposes, it now

Equal educational opportunity.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

concern under the Spending Clause.

25

Clause operations are pretty clear.

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, that raises a
I mean, the Spending
The Federal

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

government proposes a deal to the States.

2

want the money, they have to agree to these provisions.

3

And now you're saying that the content of those

4

provisions, though, is changed by new legislation.

5

If the States

And I just wonder whether that puts some

6

strain on the idea that the States have agreed to these

7

provisions when they accepted the offer under the

8

Spending Clause.

9

MR. FISHER:

No, I don't think it does.

I

10

think it's critical to get to the text for exactly the

11

reason you say, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

We know from Rowley that there's a

13

substantive guarantee in the IDEA, and we know from

14

Rowley, even in 1982, the way the Act was put together,

15

that that substantive guarantee must track the way that

16

the IEP provisions -- the individual educational program

17

provisions work.

18

That's at page 203 and 204 of Rowley.

So to get to the text and exactly what the

19

State agrees to, you start with the FAPE definition, the

20

definition for free appropriate public education.

21

all agree on that.

22

the school has to provide an education, quote, "in

23

conformity with the IEP plan."

24
25

We

Sub D of that definition says that

Then, to understand what that means, again,
this is straight out of Rowley and straight out of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

text, you turn to what the IEP provisions provide, and

2

those are laid out at pages 52A and 53A of the

3

government's appendix.

4

And, in a nutshell, what they say over and

5

over again is that standards, generally speaking, for

6

children with disabilities should be aimed at the

7

general educational curriculum.

8

start with the general educational curriculum that

9

applies to all kids, then you identify the child's

So what you do is you

10

disability and how it impacts that child's ability to

11

participate and progress in that general educational

12

curriculum.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. FISHER:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How does that work?

Then -I'm sorry.

How does

16

that work with students whose disabilities generally

17

wouldn't allow them in -- in their own -- with their own

18

potential to follow the general educational curriculum?

19

I understand how it worked in Rowley --

20

MR. FISHER:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.
-- where we were

22

dealing with someone with a particular disability, but

23

one that was rather readily and easily addressed.

24

MR. FISHER:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Uh-huh.

Alderson Reporting Company

Here you have a very

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

different context.

2

goal here, would you, was to progress consistent with

3

the general educational curriculum?

4

MR. FISHER:

I mean, you would not say that the

Most likely not all the way up

5

to grade level in this case, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

that question, just as you asked me earlier, is

7

expressly answered in the statute.

8
9

But

So on page 52A, on the bottom of 52A in sub
CC, what this -- what the IEP provisions say is that for

10

children with disabilities who take alternate

11

assessments aligned to alternate achievement standards,

12

a description of benchmarks or short-term objectives are

13

appropriate.

14

describe how you set those goals to meet those alternate

15

achievement standards.

16

And then the rest of the IEP provisions

Now, what the Congress is referring to --

17

and let me just emphasize as I go through these

18

statutory provisions, these are all from 2004, much

19

postdating Rowley.

20

What Congress is referring to with respect

21

to alternate achievement standards are laid out at page

22

79A of the government's appendix.

23

amendments to the ESEA that Congress enacted in the No

24

Child Left Behind Act and that have been aligned with

25

the IDEA.

These are the

So if you look at page 79A, there are four

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

subdivisions -- or five, I'm sorry -- five subdivisions

2

that describe what you do for the child,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, that you were asking about.

4

perhaps the most important is -- are sub 3 and sub 4.

5
6

And

So if -- if you'll permit, because the text
is so important, I'll read them to you.

7

Sub 3 says that the standards in this

8

situation must, quote, "reflect professional judgment as

9

to the highest possible standards achievable by such

10

students."

11

And then what sub 4 does to complete the

12

circle and make absolutely clear to the States and

13

everybody else that this is required, it says those

14

standards must, quote, "be designated in the

15

individualized education program developed under the

16

IDEA."

17

So the question you asked is expressly

18

answered in the text.

19

IDEA.

20

"substantial educational opportunity" are the words

21

Congress used in the findings and purposes to

22

encapsulate what is required by these IEPs.

23

It is expressly answered in the

And so to bring me back to our standard,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I suppose -- I suppose

24

it's implicit in your standards and in some of the

25

provisions you read that what we're talking about is the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

word "reasonable" that we see throughout the law.

2

Do -- do you see any -- any function for

3

that word and, in addition, as part of what reasonable

4

is, is there any place to discuss the cost that the --

5

would -- would be incurred for, say, severely disabled

6

students?

7
8

MR. FISHER:

Let me answer both

reasonableness first and cost second.

9

So reasonableness, yes, is an essential

10

feature of the Act.

11

said that the plan that the -- that the IEP team puts

12

together needs to be, quote, "reasonably calculated to

13

achieve the level of educational benefit that should be

14

guaranteed."

15

And in Rowley itself, the Court

So, if you go into court -- or actually

16

here, you don't start in court; you start with a hearing

17

officer.

18

parent has to show is that the plan the school adopted

19

was one that no reasonable educator would have adopted.

20

And so reasonableness is an important part of the --

21

of -- of the way a court would look at it, the hearing

22

officer, and indeed the IEP teams.

23

And if there's going to be a dispute, what a

Now, with specific reference to cost, let me

24

say three things about cost, Justice Kennedy.

25

all, the vast, vast majority of IEPs and programs put

Alderson Reporting Company

First of

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

together under the statute don't cost much at all.

2

involve things like providing braille textbooks,

3

providing an iPad, providing some specialized

4

instruction by a -- by a staff member who's already on

5

staff.

6

They

There are going to be some extreme cases,

7

and the Court saw one several years ago in the Garrett

8

F. case, which involved a situation where a child with a

9

ventilator needed full-time nursing services, and the

10

Court quite clearly said that even there, where the

11

school district was saying that was going to cost 30 to

12

$40,000, the Act does not permit cost to trump what the

13

Act otherwise requires.

14

And the reason why, Justice Kennedy, is

15

because Congress expressly thought about this.

16

way back to the 1975 Act what Congress said is this:

17

Yes, it costs money and that's why it's spending cause

18

legislation and that's why we're giving money to the

19

States, but it is cheaper to provide services to

20

somebody while they are being educated than it is to pay

21

out of the public fisc for the rest of that person's

22

life than make up for the deficit that a bad education

23

provided.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

All the

Mr. -- Mr. Fisher, the

tab here is -- is at $70,000 tuition?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, at the

2

time this case was litigated, it was more like $40,000

3

in the private school.

4

number you described.

5

private school -- remember, the school district had an

6

opportunity come -- to come forward with -- with a

7

proper IEP plan to provide Drew with a FAPE, and it

8

simply --

9

Currently, it is closer to the
But the tab to put the child in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in your -- in your

10

position, what -- in your view, what should have been

11

done for this student?

12

MR. FISHER:

The first and most important

13

thing that should have been done is what's known as a

14

behavioral assessment should have taken place to figure

15

out why Drew's behaviors were so dramatically

16

interfering with his education.

17

every reasonable educator would have done; all the

18

peer-reviewed research say it's vital.

19

first thing that the private school did in this

20

situation.

21

out in the supplemental Joint Appendix, that was never

22

done.

That's something that

It's the very

And if you look at the plans that are laid

23

And what's -- what's particularly striking,

24

Justice Kennedy, is that even after Drew was really, in

25

an emergency situation in the spring of his fourth grade

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

year, put into private school, the parents came back to

2

the school district again six months later in November

3

and said now that we see he's progressing, now that

4

they've done a behavioral analysis, what will you do,

5

because we actually would like to have him educated in

6

the public schools.

7

was offer -- and this is at pages 182 and 183 -- the

8

exact same failed behavioral plan that they had been

9

using in the fourth grade.

10

And it's amazing that all they did

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Weren't they going to --

11

what -- the -- the conference that the parents didn't

12

attend, they had scheduled a conference, and I thought a

13

behavioral expert was part of that conference.

14

MR. FISHER:

So there were two conferences,

15

Justice Ginsburg.

16

Drew's fourth grade year that the same old plan was

17

presented with no experts.

18

There was a first one in April of

They then offered to have another conference

19

a month later in May, and what the parents decided at

20

that point is things had reached such a critical and

21

emergency stage, that Drew was falling so far behind,

22

they had to put him in a private school, so they did not

23

attend that meeting.

24
25

But, Justice Ginsburg, what my friend on the
other side leaves out of his brief is that what I just

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

described, which is the parents did return in the fall

2

once Drew had been stabilized and did offer to meet with

3

the school district.

4

autism expert to that meeting, and the plan that they

5

proposed to deal with his behavior is verbatim the same

6

plan that they had offered back in the fourth grade.

The school district brought no

7

And so at that point, the -- the parents had

8

no choice reasonably but to leave Drew in private school

9

and to seek remedies under the Act.

And there are going

10

to be -- and I think this returns me to Justice

11

Kennedy's question about cost.

12

Congress recognized, and this Court recognized in

13

Burlington, that there are going to be rare extreme

14

circumstances where children are going to be put into a

15

private school or otherwise need significant

16

resources --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

We recognized, and

Why didn't the -- why

18

didn't the -- the statement that an IEP, what it has to

19

do is it has to, based on peer-reviewed research, when

20

practicable, will -- will be provided to the child to

21

advance appropriately towards attaining the annual goals

22

to make progress in the general education curriculum and

23

so forth.

24

that, wouldn't that have been violated?

25

wrote the IEP that way, wouldn't you be able to go to

So you've just described if the situation is

Alderson Reporting Company

Or if they

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

court and say, look, there is their IEP and they didn't

2

live up to it?

3

So you already have two arguments under the

4

statute, and the problem that's working in my mind is if

5

we suddenly adopt a new standard, all over the country

6

we'll have judges and lawyers and -- and -- and people

7

interpreting it differently and -- and -- so why isn't

8

the present situation sufficient?

9

MR. FISHER:

10

Yeah.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Besides having nine people

11

who don't know -- I mean, at least speaking for

12

myself -- don't know that much about it, creating a new

13

standard out of legal materials which are at a distance

14

from the people, the children and the parents, who need

15

help.

16

MR. FISHER:

So I think the critical reason

17

why the Court in Rowley itself gestured towards needing

18

the need for a overall standard that encapsulates the

19

Act and the reason why we ask for it here today is that

20

you will find in every brief in this case -- our

21

brief --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. FISHER:

Uh-huh.

-- the red brief, their amicus

24

briefs -- everyone agrees that school districts, I

25

believe -- this is at page 29 and 47 of my friend's

followed.

3

that it just doesn't happen.

Everybody agrees that.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

The difficulty is, is

Well, I'm sorry if it

5

doesn't happen.

6

happen?

7

to say that and you have a system for enforcement.

8

how does us suddenly using this word "equal" -- you

9

know, the word "equal" has history from a lot of

What are we supposed to do to make it

I mean, you have a statute that certainly seems

10

different areas of law.

11

a wide range of -- of disabilities, a huge range in

12

individual students and -- and -- do you see what I

13

foresee?

And

And -- and what do you do with

14

MR. FISHER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

I -I foresee taking the money

16

that ought to go to the children and spending it on

17

lawsuits and lawyers and all kinds of things that are

18

extraneous.

19

That is what's actually bothering me.
MR. FISHER:

Right.

So let -- let me

20

address -- say a word more about why we need a standard,

21

and then I'll say something about the lawsuits question

22

that you raised.

23

So, first, we need a standard because the

24

Act -- it's best to encapsulate what the IEP provisions

25

required.

If you don't like the word "equal," I'm

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

seemingly giving you the word that Congress used when it

2

amended the Act, and that very much -- this Court said

3

very much the same thing in Rowley when it said, in the

4

general situation, a child's plan should be tailored to

5

allow her to advance from grade to grade.

6

Now, if you don't want to use the word

7

"equal," here's what we would suggest, Justice Breyer:

8

You can say, as a general rule, the IEP provisions and,

9

therefore, the FAPE requirement of the Act, demands a

10

level of educational services designed to allow the

11

child to progress from grade to grade in the general

12

curriculum.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, suppose we have a

14

child who is a handicapped child, there's a range of

15

people, and they can't do much for them, but they can do

16

something for them.

17

them, do it.

And if they can do something for

18

MR. FISHER:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.
But if you, say, measure

20

that in terms of their ability to progress from grade to

21

grade, maybe some will; some won't.

22

-- it seems to me the word "appropriate" tried to

23

recognize that.

24

that?

25

for them to do.

And how does that

And -- and do you want to recognize

I mean, you can't ask for more than is reasonable
So -- so what -- what words do we use?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

MR. FISHER:

At bottom, we agree that

2

there's flexibility in the Act to accommodate each

3

child's individual potential and needs.

4

But if I could just give a full answer to

5

your question, we think that it would be fine if the

6

Court just said the IEP should be tailored to achieve in

7

a general educational curriculum at grade level for most

8

kids.

9

and this goes back to Mr. Chief Justice's question, you

And when that is not possible, Justice Breyer,

10

would go to the alternate achievement standards

11

according to the language I described to you at page

12

79(a), and that is all straight out of the text of the

13

Act.

It's a more complicated --

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

MR. FISHER:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

How so --

-- way of putting it.
It makes a big difference

17

whether you take the word "equal" out though.

18

you've just said takes the word "equal" out of the

19

standard.

20

MR. FISHER:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

MR. FISHER:

What

Well, it might -Isn't that --

It might be, Justice Alito, I'm

23

describing what it means to provide an equal educational

24

opportunity.

25

If you don't think that I'm actually -JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I understand what an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

equal outcome would be, but I don't understand what an

2

equal opportunity means when an equal outcome is not

3

practical.

4

MR. FISHER:

What it means is that you give

5

the -- so when you're dealing with a child who cannot

6

get to grade level -- I think that's what you're

7

asking -- what it means -- and this is in a 2005

8

guidance document by the Department of Education -- what

9

it means is you're giving children with disabilities

10

equally challenging curriculum on the academic side and

11

in terms of their functional and -- functional and

12

developmental goals.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

MR. FISHER:

But for those --

The standard -- I would just

15

say the standard is highest possible standards

16

achievable directly in the text of the statute.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But for those of us who have

18

some feeling that the word "equality" is a poor fit for

19

this statute and its focus on individuation --

20

MR. FISHER:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.
-- what would you say to

22

those of us?

23

required without focusing on equality?

24
25

How would you describe what you think is

MR. FISHER:

I would say just what the Court

said in Rowley for the -- for the typical child with a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

disability who can achieve at grade level, which is the

2

standard that the school district has to try to meet, is

progress in the general educational curriculum --

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The requirement of a free appropriate public
education is not satisfied by the program that aims at

What it requires

What that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How does that differ --

6

how does your formulation differ from the one we were

7

just offered by Mr. Fisher?

8

MR. GORNSTEIN:

So I think we would take the

9

same position with respect to Amy and similar students.

10

It's grade-level competence for students who are in the

11

regular classroom or in the general curriculum.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We're talking about

13

somebody for whom I think you'd agree that that standard

14

doesn't apply.

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

16

we have a slight area of disagreement.

17

significant progress towards grade-level standards, not

18

as close as possible to grade-level standards.

19
20

Right.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so that is where
We would say

How about "meaningful"

instead of "significant"?

21

MR. GORNSTEIN:

So we are not committed to

22

any one particular terminology.

23

"significant" is synonymous with "meaningful."

24

synonymous with progress that's -- reasonably can be

Well, I think the most

important thing for you to say is that this is not a

24

maximization standard.

leave it to you to choose any of those adjectives that

And so, obviously, I'm relying

And I don't want to do something that uses

JUSTICE BREYER:

So we -So I go back to look at two

11

words.

12

There's several.

13

something that should be there.

The IEP is filled with the word "progress."
So the word "progress" seems like

MR. GORNSTEIN:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that goes -- goes -- you

18

see a lot is "appropriate."

Now, you've taken that word

19

"appropriate" and spelled it out in light of the

20

student's particular needs and abilities.

21

that's what you're doing with "appropriate."

22

MR. GORNSTEIN:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
And then the other word -I would agree with that.

I think

Yes.
And if we stick

24

"appropriate" in that sentence somewhere so it's

25

significant and appropriate, does that matter?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23

2

MR. GORNSTEIN:
with that.

3
4

One of the formulations we -JUSTICE BREYER:

You looked into this and

you don't --

5

MR. GORNSTEIN:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

That happen -- we are happy

Yes.
-- see anything wrong with

sticking in the word "appropriate"?

8

MR. GORNSTEIN:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

We do not.
Okay.

Now -- now, the

10

other thing I looked at in yours is you say the

11

school -- "requires school districts to provide."

12

when I see "requires school districts to provide," I

13

begin to think everybody is going to start suing about

14

whether they did provide.

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

No, no.
So I'm thinking, well,

17

maybe it should be something like they are reasonably

18

calculated to provide.

19

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's actually -- we agree

20

with that.

21

the standard -- that's what it means to require.

22

program that is reasonably calculated to -- to make

23

That is what Rowley said, and that is what

MR. GORNSTEIN:

10
11

For all of us who might

be a little slow --

For all of us --

So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I don't mean to be

buying into your --

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So --- adversary's position.

14

I do think the Act provides enough to set a clear

15

standard.

16

come to that would be less confusing to everyone.

17

But the words are what we're trying to -- to

MR. GORNSTEIN:

So one formulation that I

18

think that would be consistent with what we are saying

19

is reasonably calculated to make progress that is

20

appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So how does that

22

actually work in -- in practice?

23

in the Rowley standard, you're dealing with someone who

24

has a disability that is readily addressed so that they

25

can keep track with grade progress.

I mean, I understand

Alderson Reporting Company

But if you're out

Official - Subject to Final Review

25

of that realm where that is not a realistic goal in

2

light of the child's potential, how do you decide what

3

it is?

4

meeting, and how do you decide --

You're sitting -- you're sitting down at the

5

MR. GORNSTEIN:

All right.

So you -- what

6

the -- the IEP provisions tell you where to start.

7

look at the -- where the child currently is in terms of

8

academic performance, what are their present levels of

9

achievement.

Then you examine the disability and you

10

ask to what extent has this impeding progress in the

11

general curriculum.

12

basically make an estimate --

13
14
15

You

17

how much progress towards grade level standards that

18

child can make in light of where they are now and the --

19

the nature of the disability.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Maybe there's still

21

time to grade level standards.

22

situations those would largely be irrelevant.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I would think in many

25

standards, but then you see the building blocks that are

You start with the grade level

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26

missing underneath those grade level standards, and you

2

set those out.

3

add, and multiplication is the standard, maybe you need

4

to learn how to add first.

5

the building blocks that the child is missing.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if you can't multiply and you can't

So you set forth what are

7

everybody.

8

before they learn how to multiply.

9

Everybody -- I say

I assume everybody needs to learn how to add

And -- and the basis of my concern is that

10

it seems to me that even though you have a lot of --

11

maybe because you have a lot of different adjectives to

12

describe the standard, that there's really nothing

13

concrete there.

14

undertake judicial review, it's not clear to me exactly

15

what they're supposed to do.

16

And when you're asking the courts to

MR. GORNSTEIN:

So -- so again, it's

17

appropriate in light of the circumstances.

18

that this is just what most school boards are already

19

doing.

20

enforcement of the standard, and the risk of court

21

over-involvement in educational decisions.

22

response to is that is not to adopt a barely more than

23

de minimis standard that nobody purports to apply, but

24

it's to say that the court's role is limited to ensuring

25

that the State's program for progress or appropriate

And we think

And I agree that the concern is with court

Alderson Reporting Company

But the

Official - Subject to Final Review

progress is based on reasonable educational judgments.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you agree with Mr. Fisher

3

that cost has no place in this calculation?

4

how expensive it would be and no matter what the impact

5

in, let's say, a poor school district would be on the

6

general student population, cost can't be considered?

7

And do you think in the real world, school boards are

8

disregarding costs entirely?

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No matter

So they're definitely not

10

disregarding costs entirely, because there could be two

11

different programs, both of which are reasonable, and

12

they would take into account costs, surely, in deciding

13

which of those reasonable programs to adopt.

14

But more generally, I would say the answer

15

is no in the usual case.

16

that's -- what the Court said is you consider cost in

17

deciding what the standard should be in the first place,

18

but cost can't define what the standards are.

19

And -- and from Cedar Rapids,

And that makes sense to me in -- in light of

20

the way you look at this statute.

21

knew, when it passed this law, that there were going to

22

be some significant expenses associated with some kids,

23

and that's why it gave money and made it an opt-in

24

program.

25

Rapids and the structure of the statute tell you that in

Congress obviously

So at the very least, it seems to me, Cedar

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the usual case it can't be cost, but --

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you -- do you know what

3

percentage of the funds that are spent by school

4

districts for this program are paid by the Federal

government?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

-- my -- but the point of it is they realized that they

I could be -- I could be corrected, and maybe my

that costs should be measured against the possible

sure, Justice Kennedy, after --

what Congress had in mind, the idea that you've got to

That's actually the way -- that's

this is why I -- I guess I -- I -- I can't readily agree

with your understanding of it's all procedures and we

just have to make sure the procedures are followed,

because what the Act does is it sets up an

Often, what the hearing officer is told to do,

4

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Kagan, we don't

5

disagree with a lot of what you said.

6

that we do think -- and Rowley is very clear on this --

7

that there is a substantive standard in the IDEA.

8

just a "some benefit" standard, not -- and there's nine

9

different standards now that we've heard just in the

That is to say

It's

10

last half hour, which I'll walk you through in a minute,

11

but that the Petitioner and the government are saying,

12

so it's some benefit.

13

We do think there's substantive review.

14

That's what that provision is about.

15

that provision also says there can be procedural review

16

on a harmless error.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And by the way,

But your substantive

18

standard is so low, is so easy to meet, and then you

19

justify that.

20

it's all in the process.

21

You say, don't worry about it because

But this provision, the idea of what a

22

hearing officer is supposed to do, and then what a court

23

is supposed to do, says it's not all in the process.

25

MR. KATYAL:

respects.

that it had bite.

13

using the some benefit standard just from this year.

14

Judge Colloton's opinion in CB.

15

saying this is not some, you know, totally minor

16

standard, it is the standard that Rowley said.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's three cases

There's case after case

It says "some

18

benefit," but you're -- you're reading it as saying

19

"some benefit," and the other side is reading it as

20

saying "some benefit," and you know that --

21

(Laughter.)

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it makes a

23

difference.

24

problematic for you is because Rowley just doesn't say

25

"some benefit."

And I -- one reason I think that it -- it's

It tells you what it is.

Alderson Reporting Company

And it's

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

enough benefit to keep track with grade progress.

2

if that's what the standard is, that's certainly more

3

than -- you know, slightly more than de minimis.

4

And

And, now, obviously, we -- we -- you can't

5

take that actual substantive standard and apply it in a

6

case such as this, but it does seem to indicate that

7

there is a substantive standard and it's not just some

8

benefit.

9

MR. KATYAL:

Well, our position is Rowley

10

doesn't say that it's got to be grade-level progress.

11

Rather, it says that you've got the -- the word

12

"appropriate" -- this is footnote 21 -- reflects --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. KATYAL:

The -- the --

-- reflects, quote, "Its

15

recognition that some settings simply are not suitable

16

environments for the participation of some handicapped

17

children," not as a term of art which concisely

18

expresses the standard found by the lower court's

19

equality standard.

20

there -- there are lots of different ways of trying to

21

understand what the statute means, but Rowley said the

22

way for the Court to understand it is Spending Clause

23

legislation.

24

and they need to know the terms of the deal, and to the

25

extent there's any ambiguity, I think Rowley was very

That is to say, I think, you can --

That is, the State entered into a contract

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

clear in saying it is just some benefit, and that is a

natural thing it follows from the kind of presumption

against de minimis --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You don't think "some

benefit" is ambiguous?

6

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I think that there's a

7

little bit of ambiguity in that, but I think it's a lot

8

easier to administer that question because the

9

question -- you know, Justice Ginsburg, let's just say,

10

this is the way ordinary English works.

11

If I have a duty to benefit you, Justice

12

Ginsburg, if I give you no benefit, I think courts can

13

easily review that.

14

fallen down on my duty.

15

benefit, I've met my duty to benefit you, but I think

16

that --

17
18

I've given you no benefit, I've
Now, if I've given you some

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I think it doesn't

say it's more than de minimis.

19

MR. KATYAL:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. KATYAL:

Exactly, but that can't be -So what is it?

That can't be -- just to finish

22

that -- that -- that thought.

23

standard is, if I benefit you significantly, that's the

24

standard; or if I benefit you equally with your

25

colleagues or something like that.

It can't be that the

Alderson Reporting Company

That's all adding

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

words to the statute that aren't there.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where is it?

As I see one

3

way of looking at what we're doing, two things have

4

occurred.

5

doesn't -- it deliberately doesn't say how much, and

6

that's why you get the ambiguity.

7

One, Rowley itself is somewhat ambiguous.

The second thing that happens is the statute

8

is amended.

9

looking at those somewhat ambiguous words in Rowley in

10
11

It

So what we're doing is going back and

light of a statute that was amended.
Now, when you look at the statute that was

12

amended in the IEP, you do see in at least two and maybe

13

more places that that IEP is designed to be a statement

14

that will produce -- meet the child's needs to enable

15

the child to be involved in and make progress in the

16

general education, and then further, advance

17

appropriately towards an -- annual goals to make

18

progress in the general education.

19

So now what the SG has done is go back, take

20

those words, "make progress," and put them in a phrase

21

which, in fact, I think with not much modification says,

22

look, let's read what Rowley said in light of these

23

additional words, "make progress," which are statutory

24

words, while taking account of great differences by

25

using words like "appropriately in light of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

student's particular needs and abilities," and those all

2

come from the statute.

3

MR. KATYAL:

So, Justice Breyer, three

4

things.

5

is ambiguous as it's been interpreted for 34 years.

6

Indeed, they can't cite any cases showing that there's

7

any problem.

8

19, things are working just fine.

9

there's, like, some need for this Court to get involved

Number one is we don't agree that Rowley itself

Indeed, their reply brief admits at page
So the idea that

10

and clarify Rowley, I think, you know, there's no case

11

law or anything to support that.

12

Second, the idea that the amendments somehow

13

changed the game, I think, is not nearly enough to be

14

the clear statement that Pennhurst requires.

15

this isn't just elephants being hided -- hided in mouse

16

holes.

17

mouse holes.

18

to the things that he had to point to.

19

D4, romanette ii, and things like that, none of which --

20

I mean,

This is elephants being hidden in romanette
I mean, this is -- you know, just listen

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's subsection

But would you agree with

21

at least the courts should say that the formulation more

22

than de minimis sets the level too low, and that's --

23

that's the formula that was used at levels here.

24
25

MR. KATYAL:
disagree with that.

And, Justice Ginsburg, we

We think more than de minimis,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

which is what almost every circuit is using right now,

2

has worked and it follows naturally from the some

3

benefit language in Rowley.

4

Now, you might disagree --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

So you're -- you're

equating some benefit to more than --

7

MR. KATYAL:

More than de minimis.

We think

8

it means the same thing, and we think there's a long

9

history of experience with this showing that it's

10

working.

11

And to return, Justice Breyer, to a point

12

that you had made before.

13

concern about the standard.

14

to Congress.

15

you know, it would invite all sorts of litigation.

16

And just look at what Mr. Fisher said.

It's that there's some
That's really got to be up

If this Court were to change the standard,

As

17

the Chief Justice started, he -- first his petition

18

started with a substantial equal opportunity standard,

19

then it became in its merits brief an equal opportunity

20

standard, then in the beginning of his oral argument it

21

was, quote, "tailored to achieve at grade level what" --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But, Mr. Katyal,

23

let's say -- let's say that during the school year, the

24

school districts -- district sends someone to work with

25

the particular student in this case, and they send her

that's it.

4

than not at all, but you wouldn't say that satisfies the

5

statute.

6

And that's all they do.

And

That's some

Better to have the person there for two weeks

MR. KATYAL:

It does not.

As our brief

7

explains there is two different provisions in the

8

statute, 1414(b)(r) and (c)(5)(A), which explain that

9

the benefit from special education must be, quote,

10

"continuous."

So --

And Cedar Rapids actually said that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

just change the hypothetical.

14

a day.

15

MR. KATYAL:

Okay.

So -- and

She's there five minutes

And -- and -- and, you know,

16

five minutes a day, I think, wouldn't meet the

17

de minimis standard.

18

not a significant -- that -- that is not a word --

19

That is -- that is, that itself is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess it

20

depends on whether somebody can tell us at some point

21

whether it's beneficial.

22

would agree that it -- well, I mean, are you saying that

23

the -- the judicial review is supposed to be whether

24

that's de minimis or more than de minimis, and they're

25

supposed to say, well, a half hour is -- is -- is good,

And yet, I think most people

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

it's not de minimis, but that's all you have to do?

2

MR. KATYAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, I'm saying

3

two different things.

4

there, that it would flunk substantive de minimis

5

review, but you wouldn't get there.

6

judgment here was to put the emphasis on procedural

7

protections in the Act, and they bolstered them in '97

8

and 2004.

9

creating an IEP team process where they trusted teachers

Congress's whole

And as long as they could shine a light by

10

and they trusted parents who are highly incentivized to

11

come together --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but you're

13

putting a lot -- you're assuming that the procedural

14

process will yield significant results.

15

the whole thing?

16

comes in.

17

well, you need to have somebody there six hours of the

18

day to help the child learn, and they say, okay,

19

that's -- that's the procedure, we listen to you.

20

fact, we're only going to have somebody there a half

hour a day.

What if they do

Yeah, we have a hearing.

said at page 206 of its opinion.

25

Congress's judgment.

That -- that was

Now, I agree, you can give me a hypothetical

2

which says that in some case the procedures aren't going

3

to work and there's going to be a bad result.

4

is perfect, not even a judicial system, as the error

5

correction rules of this Court recognize.

6

No system

I think the -- the question for the Court is

7

should you kind of re-jigger the statute and impose a

8

new standard, particularly in the context --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's not exact --

You'll have to excuse me,

11

I'm not sure I understood your answer to the Chief

12

Justice.

13

He -- he had a hypothetical where you have

14

the hearing, the hearing makes a recommendation,

15

recommendation not followed.

MR. KATYAL:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What result?

If the recommend -And -- and then I thought

good enough.

do you want to actually impose something new?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. KATYAL:

I get it from Rowley itself at

page 200 which says that --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. KATYAL:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

What do you do with

"meaningful" --

20

22

So where do you get

"some benefit" from?

16
17

I mean,

So "meaningful" --- that was in Rowley

itself?
MR. KATYAL:

So "meaningful" was not

24

actually in Rowley.

25

"meaningful" once only to say that it can't be more than

The Court there just mentioned

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45

meaningful.

2

is some baggage, as Mr. Gornstein says, but the really

3

important baggage is actually what this Court said in

4

Cedar Rapids, which is that meaningful access doesn't

11

"some" -- what is it?

So that's what we have --

They are

"Some" -- "some" -- "some

MR. KATYAL:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

"Some benefit."
You could say some benefit

or you could say some benefit.

16

MR. KATYAL:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

That's what we have -- we

As was just pointed out, those words

13

We have the words you've mentioned.

10

There

Yeah.
All right.

Now, that's an

ambiguity.

19

MR. KATYAL:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
And as you pointed out,

21

most courts have interpreted what I think is the correct

22

thing, they said benefit.

Okay?

23

really no problem.

There is really no problem.

24

But there still is a problem with the language in a

25

handful of courts.

Okay?

And you say there is

And now we have an IEP statute which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1
2
3

again and again and again looks to progress.
So why is it making something up out of
whole cloth --

4

MR. KATYAL:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, first --- simply to take that word

6

from the IEP, which is enforceable anyway, and say, look

7

at these two words of ambiguity, and we think we should

8

interpret them in light of the IEP requirements, which

9

are pretty close to what the SG suggests?

10

MR. KATYAL:

But, Justice Breyer, I don't

11

think that there was some problem in the lower courts.

12

They're not citing cases that show that there's some

13

parade of horribles akin to the hypotheticals --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. KATYAL:

Uh-huh.

-- that we've heard.

And

16

Congress's judgment was that the procedural protections

17

will do a lot at the front end to avoid that problem.

18

There might be some situation at the back end, but

19

that's where the system -- systemic requirements of the

20

IDEA No Child Left Behind are so important.

21

what they say is that the Department of Education can

22

cut off funds, can redirect funds, can require annual

23

reports, all sorts of things happening.

24
25

Because

And, indeed, annual reports have been
required since 2004 to Congress.

Congress has never

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

changed the statute in the way they want, a substantive

2

standard change.

3

4

standard is generally working.

5

the top.

6

You know, and -- and, again, their own

JUSTICE ALITO:

Teachers are teaching to

What is frustrating about

7

this case and about this statute is that we have a

8

blizzard of words.

9

MR. KATYAL:

10
11

And if you -Right.

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- read them literally, it's

not clear to me that they mean anything different.

12

Now, "progress" benefit.

Yeah, I don't see

13

how you can have a benefit unless you're making some

14

progress.

15

"Significant," "meaningful," they're

16

synonyms.

17

it's more than de minimis.

18

minimis, you could say it's significant.

19

that you note.

20

seems to be looking for is the word that has just the

21

right nuance to express this thought.

22

If something is significant or meaningful,
And if it's more than de
It's something

So it's really -- I mean, what everybody

MR. KATYAL:

Well, we think that you should

23

look to what Rowley did here, which is to say the word

24

is "some benefit."

25

text of the statute itself.

And that actually follows from the
There is a long

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

presumption, Justice Alito, against de minimis, starting

2

with Wrigley, which this Court said applies to all

3

statutes.

4

but there is no canon about significance or quality or

5

anything like that.

6
7

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the difference

between "some benefit" and "significant"?

8
9

So we think our standard comes from the text,

MR. KATYAL:

I think it's quite large; that

is, you know -- you know, I think it's straightforward.

10

So, you know, basically, I think, you know, if -- if the

11

Court is to ask whether there is some benefit, as I was

12

saying to Justice Ginsburg in my hypothetical, you know,

13

that's a pretty easy question, is, have I benefited?

14

Has the school district benefited?

15

getting beyond that to "significant," the Court has to

16

ask both:

17

benefit significant?

18
19
20
21
22

But once we start

Was there some benefit and then was that
And I can imagine --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

say -MR. KATYAL:

what is significant.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It didn't just say

"some benefit."

normally allow the -- a student with the disability to

25

keep up with his peers in a different grade.

It said that that benefit would

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, as soon as they say that, you

2

appreciate that you're dealing with more than just some

3

benefit.

I mean, that's a significant benefit.

4

(Laughter.)

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well --

Significant --

6

"significant," "meaningful," whatever.

7

simply de minimis.

8

at something and say, aha, here, that was helpful, that

9

was helpful, because it's -- the whole package has got

It's more than

It suggests that you can't just look

10

to be helpful enough to allow the student to keep up

11

with his peers.

12

MR. KATYAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

13

think that's what Rowley said when it used grade to

14

grade.

15

just to say, procedurally, they've got to consider that

16

and make sure that, for example, a high school kid isn't

17

put in first grade.

18

the test.

19

that there's any sort of level-of-education test.

20

I think that all the -- the grade to grade was

But I don't think that's part of

And several times Rowley rejected this idea

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how does your

21

position, Mr. Katyal -- you have a passage in your brief

22

on page 47 which says, "An IEP must have the goal of

23

advancing a child in the general education curriculum

24

and, to the extent possible, enable her to be educated

25

in the school's regular classes."

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

And, to me, that sounds exactly like what

2

the chief justice just said, that an IEP has to be

3

reasonably calculated to do those things.

4

not, then relief follows.

5

MR. KATYAL:

And if it's

So I think, again, it's just a

6

procedural guarantee that they have to think about and

7

consider grade-level progress.

8

substantive standard --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It does not mean sort of

That's wrong.

This is not

10

just a procedural guarantee.

11

procedures in it, but they're all geared towards a

12

particular substantive result.

13

substantive result that's the focus of the -- both the

14

administrative process and then judicial review of what

15

comes out of the administrative process.

16

MR. KATYAL:

Yes, the IDEA has lots of

And it's that

But I don't think so, Justice

17

Kagan.

18

IEP must address, not how an IEP must deal with them.

19

And so if you look -- and I think the Second Circuit

20

recently, in a case called LO v. New York City just a

21

couple of months ago, decided -- basically went through

22

this and said the 1414 standards like that are

23

checklist.

24

and things like that.

25

I think all that those standards say is what an

You've got to consider grade-level progress

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if we --

MR. KATYAL:

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

But you wouldn't --- consider all of them and

we do none of them, that's just fine?

4

MR. KATYAL:

That's -- well, the Congress's

5

judgment was the process -- and this is something that

6

happens in NEPA --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

Kagan is yes.

9

nothing, that's okay.

10

So your answer to Justice

If you consider everything but do

MR. KATYAL:

No.

Because there's still --

11

if you do nothing, then you haven't provided any

12

benefit.

13

the standard of Rowley itself.

14

the context of Spending Clause legislation, you can't do

15

more than that and require something significant.

And so there is still some substantive bite in
What we're saying is, in

16

And the reason, Justice Kennedy, is once you

17

start going into significance, as the amici briefs point

18

out, education is the most -- one of the more contested

areas in our society.

disagree.

That's really got to be a judgment

Rowley expressly said the Pennhurst

10

principle applies to this provision of the statute.

11

This is core legislation, core -- a core requirement of

12

the statute, and they are imposing any number of

13

different standards.

14

And so I understand that there is some

15

policy concerns among -- among the Court, even if

16

they're not shared by the -- my friends on the other

17

side, because they disclaim them.

18

there are those policy concerns, that's really got to be

19

something that Congress deals with.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But to the extent

And what I'm -One -- one aspect of --

22

of your position is you say yes, there is a substantive

23

standard, some benefit.

24

your argument, said some, as interpreted by most courts,

25

has bite.

And then you, in the course of

But then you say de minimis is enough -- more

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

than de minimis is enough.

2

MR. KATYAL:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4
5

Correct.
So some with bite and

more than de minimis don't sound like equivalence to me.
MR. KATYAL:

I think they are, and I think

6

that's what the -- circuit after circuit has said, which

7

is that some educational benefit, the language at page

8

200, means more -- more than de minimis.

9

you know, I think there is a whole variety of cases that

10
11

And so -- and,

have interpreted this.
And, Justice Ginsburg, even this Court has

12

actually had one of them.

13

came from a circuit which had a "more than merely de

14

minimis" standard.

15

substantively didn't meet the protections of the "some

16

benefit" or "merely more than de minimis" standard.

17

In Florence v. Carter, that

The Court there found that the IEP

We get that -- I mean, how

18

does this actually work?

19

in 1414 before that, it says you have to, school

district, write an IEP.

21

And one of the things it says an IEP is, is it is a

22

statement of the services, et cetera, based on peer

23

review stuff that will be provided for the child to

24

advance appropriately and to make progress in the

25

general education curriculum.

I thought there is a statute

Then it says what an IEP is.

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, suppose the school district writes a

statement called an IEP, but it does not show that the

Yes.

MR. KATYAL:

Now, isn't there something

Now, let's suppose they

write it, but they don't do it.

So they have to write

MR. KATYAL:

Correct, Justice Breyer.

But

2

what there is not is something in 1414 which says that

they've got to provide a significant benefit or an equal

JUSTICE BREYER:

But they do have to provide

something that makes progress in the general education

MR. KATYAL:

It's just the same as Rowley.

Rowley -- you know, we're not saying anything different

than what Rowley said.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know.

I would say

Some educational benefit.
Some educational benefit.

If you say "some," this is inconsistent with Rowley.
MR. KATYAL:

Well, I don't think so.

I

8

think it's got to be some educational benefit designed

to get the general education curriculum or --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Katyal -Mr. Katyal, are there --

12

in the wake of the many years this Act has been enforced

13

and these many individual meetings, have there been

14

documented areas of consensus as to certain standards,

15

certain methodologies, certain systems that work and

16

certain that don't?

17

these proceedings, ever refer to those?

18

And do the courts, in reviewing

MR. KATYAL:

So I think that's where the

19

amici briefs are so important, because they show -- say

20

that education isn't really one of those areas.

21

you know, people disagree about the most simple things

22

about educational philosophy.

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean,

So we've gone -- so we've

gone nowhere.
MR. KATYAL:

Well, I don't think we've gone

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

nowhere, but I think that worry is to thrust courts into

2

the business of deciding which philosophy is

3

appropriate.

4

And take Firefly, for --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you say that there is

6

generally no consensus as to appropriate methodologies

7

for, say, a hearing-impaired student, an autistic

8

student.

9

No agreement on that?
MR. KATYAL:

I don't mean to say that

10

there's no agreement.

11

amici briefs and the case law recognizes that there is a

12

lot of disagreement.

13

picking up on San Antonio v. Rodriguez, that the

to Justice Ginsburg's question that I'm a bit confused

2

of -- about for the same reason.

3

You said something like, well, this -- this

4

standard is -- is being applied with bite.

5

wondering, do you favor a standard with bite?

6

MR. KATYAL:

So I'm just

We favor the standard that

7

Rowley said, which lower courts have done for 34 years,

8

which does have --

9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:
bite?

11
12

MR. KATYAL:
does.

It does have some bite.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Would that be "some bite" or

"somebite"?

15

(Laughter.)

MR. KATYAL:

It is some educational benefit.

That's the language of Rowley.

We're not trying to --

14

Do you favor a standard with

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And if you disagree with

Well, again, if somebody

20

said to you, write a stature with -- write a standard

21

with bite, I doubt you would come up with the words

22

"more than merely de minimis."

23

MR. KATYAL:

Well, but again, I think,

24

Justice Kagan, Congress's bite, the substantive bite is

25

only at the back end.

It's a small feature in a much

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

bigger statute.

2

Congress's judgment was --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

this case is all about.

5

MR. KATYAL:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

MR. KATYAL:

But the back end is what

I understand that.
We are at the back end.

But -- but, Justice Kagan,

8

don't take the policy concerns about the hypotheticals

9

and other things to try and re-jigger the back end.

10

Congress's handiwork was to say it's the

11

procedural protections shining a light, the IEP process

12

with highly incentivized teachers and -- teachers and

13

parents that's generally going to yield the right

14

result.

15

That's what Rowley itself said at page 206.
JUSTICE ALITO:

We're going to have to use

16

musical notation to -- and not just words -- to express

17

the -- the idea that seems to be emerging.

Would you say -- I'll ask the same thing of
Mr. Fisher if he has a chance to address it.
If -- if we were to look at what the lower

you say that they are doing -- that they are applying

That sounds very harsh.

Who thought this up?
MR. KATYAL:

What's the origin of this phrase, "more than de

I know where "de minimis"

comes from.

MR. KATYAL:

no.

18

It's -- Justice Scalia invokes it why and folks in the

19

Wrigley case.

22

The -- the presumption against trifles, you know.

It's an old formulation.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But who -- who decided to

apply it here in this context?
MR. KATYAL:

Well, I think the Court in --

23

in Rowley, then Justice Rehnquist's opinion, invoked

24

that by talking about some benefit.

25

that is a presumption that applies to all statutes.

Alderson Reporting Company

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

But all

MR. FISHER:

Three points, Your Honors.

Two

about the statute, and one about the practicalities.
First, as to the statute, the word

24

"procedural" has been used by my friend to describe the

25

IEP provisions.

But whenever pressed, even he admits

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

that the IEP provisions are enforceable in the way

Justice Breyer described, which is the plan has to meet

question on the ground, and if I'll circle back to my

other statutory point.

17

That brings me to an important

JUSTICE ALITO:

Before -- putting aside -- I

18

don't want -- I'll take 10 seconds.

19

words, are the outcomes appropriate, or do you think the

20

lower courts need a kick?

21

MR. FISHER:

Putting aside the

I think they need a kick.

I

22

think the outcomes are quite scattered.

23

only reason why you get some favorable outcomes is

24

because even the courts themselves don't believe barely

25

more than de minimis.

Alderson Reporting Company

I think the

Official - Subject to Final Review

But I think you have a disjoint.

And my

2

friend keeps pointing to the amicus briefs.

3

educators are, by and large, following the plan -- I'm

4

sorry -- the -- the standard we propose and the

5

solicitor general imposes.

6

I think

The No Child Left Behind Act in 2004 was a

7

very important, revolutionary, bipartisan policy change.

8

And so educators on the ground are aiming high, as they

9

put it.

The city's brief says we are aiming to maximize

10

the benefit for our students.

11

disjoint between what educators are doing and the

12

courts.

13

very, very, very, very, very rare case that makes it

14

into the court system is not being properly reviewed.

And so you have a

And the reason they need a kick is because the

15

And that leaves the last point I want to

16

respond to, which is the fact that Congress left us

17

alone after Rowley.

18

and in Honig and in other cases is the IEP rules are,

19

quote, "the centerpiece of the Act."

20

centerpiece for how the education delivery services are

What the Court has said in Rowley

They're the

provisions were quite hollow.

They

Justice Breyer has been referring to, and we repeatedly

2

refer to in our brief, and I think, Mr. Chief Justice,

you agree cannot be met under their standard.

4

And then that leaves the last little piece

5

of the puzzle here, which is this child who cannot get

6

up to grade level standards.

answer-direct question that is directly in the text of

the Act, just as my friend demands.

presented in this case.
