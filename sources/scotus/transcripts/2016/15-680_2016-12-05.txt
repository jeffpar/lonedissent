Bethune-Hill v. The Virginia State Board of Elections.

Mr. Elias.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARC E. ELIAS

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ELIAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The district court created out of whole

12

cloth a new legal standard that permitted Virginia to

13

apply a one-size-fits-all, 55 percent racial floor to

14

all 12 of its predominantly black districts.

15

applied this 55 percent rule to move voters in and move

16

voters out of districts on the basis of race, regardless

17

of the differences in voting patterns, geography,

18

demographics, or the actual interests of black voters in

19

each of those districts.

20

Virginia

This actual conflict test, which the D.C. --

21

which -- I'm sorry -- which the district court invented

22

for predominance has no basis in this Court's

23

jurisprudence.

24

immunity to visually appealing districts that

25

nevertheless were drawn with the predominant purpose of

Instead, it confers a sort of judicial

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

placing voters within and without based solely on the

2

color of their skin.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm -- I'm not quite

4

sure I understand how you assess predominance, which I

5

think is the challenge here.

6

And to take a hypothetical, let's say you're

7

trying to select people for a particular board or

8

something; and you say they have to come from a city

9

with more than 500,000 people, absolutely.

And then you

10

say, and they have to come from such a city in

11

California.

12

Can't be anywhere else.
Now, which is the predominant factor?

13

500,000 or California?

14

MR. ELIAS:

15

The

Well, in this case, under the

jurisprudence of -- of --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't really

17

care -- I'm not talking about this case.

18

hypothetical.

19

MR. ELIAS:

It's a

I think that you -- you can set

20

aside the -- the population center, and you would look

21

at the State of California as the predominant factor

22

because it is the criteria to which all others must

23

yield, and in this --

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
know that?

Well, how do you

I mean, it seems to me that the 500,000 is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

the criteria which -- to which all others might yield.

2

MR. ELIAS:

In -- in -- in that

3

hypothetical, each of them might be an unyielding

4

criteria.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MR. ELIAS:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

In this case, there is only one.
Well, no, I know.

8

That's why I'm looking -- that's why this is called a

9

hypothetical, because it's not about the particular

10

case.

11

But I -- I -- obviously, what I'm trying to

12

highlight is, "predominant" means one that dominates

13

over all the others.

14

MR. ELIAS:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.
And it's easy to

16

imagine situations where you cannot say that one

17

dominates over all the others.

18

MR. ELIAS:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

a situation like that?

21

MR. ELIAS:

22

I think -So what do you do in

I think I now understand your --

your question.

23

In that case, neither criteria would

24

predominate, because, in fact, neither one controls the

25

other.

And in that case, we would not have met our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

burden of predominance; and as a result, we wouldn't --

2

we -- we wouldn't get to the second step of strict

3

scrutiny.

4

Where you have one criteria, though, then

5

you can fairly say there was predominance, because --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if you're

7

still -- you're trying to figure out which -- which

8

predominates.

9

the test that you challenge comes from.

10

And I think this is where the inquiry or

One way to tell which is the predominant is

11

to see if they conflict.

12

do you resolve it?

13

that's the predominant one.

And if they conflict, then how

And whatever trumps the other,

14

MR. ELIAS:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. ELIAS:

That -- that -Right?

Your Honor, that is one way that

17

evidence is adduced to determine predominance.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

MR. ELIAS:

Uh-huh.

But it is not the only way.

If,

20

in fact, to use your hypothetical, the legislature of

21

California -- let's assume that they're the ones setting

22

these criteria -- says, our predominant factor, the --

23

the dominant and controlling factor, is that it has to

24

come from the State of California, the fact that it may

25

also come from a -- the members may also come from a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

city with more than 500,000 members doesn't mean that

2

the first criteria didn't predominate.

3

because the legislature told us, this is the dominant --

4

this is the dominant criteria.

5
6

JUSTICE ALITO:

We know it

And that --

What if the -- I'm sorry.

Finish.

7

MR. ELIAS:

I -- and that's what this --

8

that's what happened in this instance.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the legislature

10

says, look, we want to follow all the traditional

11

districting, applying all the traditional districting

12

factors.

13

is to be held to have violated Section 5 or Section 2 of

14

the Voting Rights Act.

15

majority-African-American districts, and we don't want

16

to do anything to them that results in liability under

17

the Voting Rights Act.

However, one thing we absolutely do not want

So we have these 12

18

Is that predominance?

19

MR. ELIAS:

It is predominance if race was

20

the -- was the controlling factor in -- that could not

21

yield in the drawing of the districts.

22

Now, it may very well be that when the Court

23

then completes its inquiry, there will be a strong basis

24

in evidence that -- that drawing the districts that way

25

was to comply with a good faith understanding of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

Voting Rights Act, and then the -- the State wins.

2
3

In this case, though, what the State did is
it started with an --

4
5

JUSTICE ALITO:

I didn't really understand

the answer to the question.

6

If the court says -- if the State says, the

7

one thing we absolutely do not want is to be found to

8

violate the -- the Voting Rights Act, that is not --

9

that -- that is not necessarily predominance, in your

10
11

view?
MR. ELIAS:

That is not necessarily

12

predominance.

13

any number of ways to comply with the Voting Rights Act

14

that do not require race to be the dominant and

15

controlling factor.

16

It is when that is -- because there are

For example, you -- you have any number of

17

districts -- I would hazard to guess -- and it is only a

18

guess -- a majority of the districts in this country --

19

that are drawn by legislatures that are

20

majority-minority, where they start with traditional

21

redistricting criteria and the district is over 50

22

percent or over whatever the -- the applicable threshold

23

is, and they never need to trump the traditional

24

redistricting criteria with race.

25

In this instance, they trumped -- and I use

that word --

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- what is your

3

evidence of that?

4

read, in -- in the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus,

5

which I had hopped would end these cases in this Court,

6

which it certainly doesn't seem to have done -- all

7

right?

8

I don't think, for you to say that they just saw some

9

traditional factors; and they didn't take into account

10

I mean, look, which I'm sure you've

But if you make the comparison, it isn't enough,

other evidence that they were using race predominantly.

11

Well, if you look at the other evidence on

12

page 1271, you know, the west thing, it was pretty

13

strong evidence.

14

those, precisely 12 were white.

They added 15,785 new voters; and of

MR. ELIAS:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right?

Right.
Now, is there -- and when

17

you looked at their use of the factors, of the

18

traditional factors, they were pretty irrelevant.

19

MR. ELIAS:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
It makes a point of that in

21

the opinion, and that -- that that's meant to guide the

22

district judges.

here?

say exactly the right words, no one can say exactly the

25

right words, what's his mistake?

And so what -- what's the equivalent

What's the equivalent if -- assuming he didn't

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

I think -You saw the 17 -- 15,785.

That's pretty strong.
MR. ELIAS:

I think if you look at

District 71 --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. ELIAS:

Okay.

Okay.
What you find is this is

14

an inner city -- just to orient to the Court, this is an

15

inner city district at the core of Richmond.

16

And this is a district that had a 46.3

17

percent BVAP, and because of the 55 percent rule that

18

had been set out, and there's really no dispute, the --

19

the district court agrees that that was a rule that

20

guided the drawing of districts, all of the districts,

21

as a result of that rule, we -- what you see is a racial

22

gerrymandering.

23

46.3 to 55.3 by essentially raiding every other district

24

around it, essentially the suburbs and the exurbs,

25

raiding those districts and bringing black voters in,

You see that that district went from

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11

notwithstanding the fact that it was a classic crossover

2

district.

3

white liberals in -- who had moved to the city were

4

voting in harmony --

5

It was a district in which, essentially,

JUSTICE BREYER:

What was the number,

6

roughly, of the new people in the district?

7

are black?

How many

How many white?

8

Of the people who were moved out of the

9

district, how many were black, how many were white,

10
11

approximately?
MR. ELIAS:

They -- they -- the -- I don't

12

have the precise number that were moved in and out, but

13

there were a significant number, in the -- in the many

14

thousands of voters who were moved in and many thousands

15

who were moved out.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

But giving a number

17

matters, because, after all, the -- the -- that was the

18

key factor in Swann.

I just -- as I stand here, I don't know them, but it's

Right, and I think that -How do I find that?

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. ELIAS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6
7

I found what I wanted to

Okay.
I just wanted to know where

to look.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Elias, could I make sure

8

I understand:

9

the policy here says 55 percent, and it says that across

10

the board as to each of these 12 districts, and it says,

11

effectively, this is the most important criteria, in the

12

sense that it will trump other things.

13

What's your view of -- let's -- let's --

All right?

So -- but -- but as I understand your

14

argument, you're not resting your case on that fact

15

alone; is that correct?

16

MR. ELIAS:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That is correct.
And why is that?

When would

18

such -- when would such a policy not have the requisite

19

impact on a voting district?

20

MR. ELIAS:

Right.

Justice Kagan, I think

21

this gets, actually, to Justice Breyer's exact point.

22

If -- if you had a district where it had no impact, it

23

actually didn't cause voters to be moved in significant

24

numbers, then -- then we agree with -- with the

25

Solicitor General's office and this court in Alabama

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

that, if a significant number of voters are not moved as

2

a result of that racial threshold, then -- then strict

3

scrutiny is not triggered.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So we really are looking to

5

what Justice Breyer suggested, which is, we're -- we're

6

looking to the movement of voters in and out of a

7

particular district?

8
9

MR. ELIAS:

Yes, and I don't think that that

is at -- at -- in dispute.

We will hear from my

10

colleague, and maybe I'll be surprised, but I don't

11

think that's the dispute.

12

is the legal error that was -- that was committed by the

13

district court in saying that, if we find a district

14

that looks like it's abided by traditional districting

15

criteria, that's the end of the inquiry.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think that the issue here

That's the --

Even -- even if we concede

17

that there were -- you know, essentially, all the

18

African-Americans were moved in and all the -- the --

19

the whites were moved out.

20

MR. ELIAS:

It's --

And even if it was done by an --

21

for an avowedly racial reason.

22

the trial court's test, a -- a -- the legislature of

23

Virginia could say, we want to corral all of the

24

African-Americans we can because we think they all vote

25

alike and we don't want them infecting the neighboring

And if, lo and behold, they then draw a

We never get to the evidence

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you're saying --

8

yeah.

9

between traditional criteria and race?

So you're saying you do not need a conflict

10

MR. ELIAS:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct.
But do you agree

12

with the Solicitor General that say -- who says,

13

nonetheless, that -- that -- quoting on page 8 of their

14

brief -- in the vast majority of cases, a conflict may

15

be necessary evidence to establish racial predominance?

19
20
21

I think that that overstates it

I'm not sure that I'd say "in the vast

In many cases, you're going to have a
correlation; I agree with the Solicitor General.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, even if you're

22

saying not in the vast majority, but in the majority,

23

or -- why is that?

24
25

Based on -- on your answer to Justice Kagan,
why is it that you're almost -- almost always or vast

majority for the SG, or something less than that in

2

your --

3

MR. ELIAS:

I -- I -- I think the reason is

4

because in the real world, the way in which population

5

distributes, you're going to need to create bizarre

6

districts in many instances, in many parts of the

7

country.

8

unappealing districts in order to conduct what is

9

essentially a Shaw violation.

10

You're going to need to have visually

But that's -- the reason why I pointed to

11

Richmond is that Richmond is exactly the instance of a

12

place where that's not going to be necessary, because

13

you do have a crossover district.

14

where you have white college students and white young

15

professionals moving into an urban -- a prior urban

16

center, voting in harmony and reinforcing with the

17

African-American population in that area.

18

necessarily be visually bizarre, but it is nevertheless

19

the destruction of that crossover district to create a

to be -- even be a --

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have a district

So it won't

We haven't said that for a

23

reason.

24

We've said it has to predominate, as you know.

25

We haven't said just the use of race is wrong.

MR. ELIAS:

Correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -- and my problem with

2

your argument here, if you want to go on the -- what the

3

district court said there, which you may be right, but

4

this is such a complicated area that it's the easiest

5

thing in the world to go through a district court

6

lengthy opinion and to find a sentence that's not

7

exactly right.

8

MR. ELIAS:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I -And that's why it seems to

10

me, if we're going to have a -- ever have districting

11

done back in the legislatures, rather than in the

12

courts, you've got to prove your case that, not only did

13

what he say was wrong, but it mattered, with pretty

14

strong evidence.

15
16

MR. ELIAS:

I -- I agree, Justice Breyer.

I -- but -- but I'd make two points in response.

17

Number one, this was not a stray sentence.

18

This is the -- the -- in every one of those hundred-plus

19

pages, this is the test he applies, over and over and

20

over again.

21

he -- there is a -- which is a discussion of this --

22

this -- this same Richmond district, and read that

23

analysis.

24

therefore we don't need to -- we don't need to address

25

it, and, by the way, district courts, we shouldn't be in

You look at the -- page 111 to 115, and

And he says, well, it's visually appealing;

the business of assessing credibility between witnesses.

2

We shouldn't be in the business of assessing credibility

3

between -- between two legislators, because after all,

4

it's visually appealing, and why would we want to do

5

that?

6

This was rife through the opinion, not an

7

isolated statement.

8

traditional redistricting principles can explain, can

9

explain, then we don't need to actually look at other

It was his holding that where

10

evidence of what the real motive was, and that error is

11

not something that comes up over and over and over

12

again.

That is a unique error in this case.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So are you proposing that

14

we remand, we tell the district court, you applied the

15

wrong standard, and that the right standard is race can

16

predominate, even if there's no distortion of the shape

17

of the district?

18

you're --

19

Is that -- is that the relief

MR. ELIAS:

I think that -- I think that

20

that is -- that is an appropriate relief, Justice

21

Ginsburg.

22

districts, the Court can simply reverse.

23

I think with respect to some of these

I think with respect to that Richmond

24

district, the analysis is the -- the facts are not

25

genuinely in dispute as to what was going on in that

district that I think it can be reversed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

It's kind of --

I'm sorry.
I was going to say:

5

It's kind of hard to do it just with respect to one,

6

isn't it?

7

these voters in, so you've got to push them back, and

8

now all of a sudden that other district has an issue.

9

Because that means, okay, you can't pull

MR. ELIAS:

I -- I -- I think,

10

Mr. Chief Justice, that's a -- that's a fair point.

11

think if you look at the map, what you'll see is, we're

12

actually talking about four geographic pockets.

13

There is a Richmond pocket of districts;

14

there is a south side Virginia, which is up against

15

the -- the border of North Carolina, there are two

16

districts; then there is a Lower Hampton Roads and an

17

Upper Hampton Roads.

18

don't impact the other.

19

I

And each of those pockets really

So, yes, I -- I -- I agree with you, in

20

general, it would cause redistricting around the

21

Richmond area, but if -- if you recall the -- in the --

22

in the Personhuballah case, which this Court heard

23

last -- last term, we dealt with a single district,

same 55 percent floor, and when they did the

2

redistricting it only affected the two neighboring

3

districts.

4

That -- I'm sorry -- that district and

5

the -- and the -- really, the district next to it, so --

6

but I -- but I understand the point, and it's -- and

7

it's a fair one.

8

an unreasonable step to take to apply it correctly.

9

And in that sense, remand would not be

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Just if I -- so I can

10

understand your sense of the relative strengths of your

11

arguments, if we did remand, say, this is the wrong

12

standard, go apply the right standard, and -- and that

13

was done fairly, where do you think he would have to

14

change his view, where do you think that there would be

15

a question, and where do you think the same result would

16

probably obtain?

17

MR. ELIAS:

So I'd like to say there would

18

be new results everywhere.

19

fairly, as I try to always do, I think in the Richmond

20

area, there is no question that a fair application of

21

the standard would lead to a new districting in -- I'm

22

sorry.

23

But to answer your question

In the Richmond area, which are

24

Districts 71, 69, 70, and 74, I think there is no

25

question that it would lead to a -- a new -- it would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20

2

lead to a -- a different map, a different result.
I think in the south side of -- of Virginia,

3

which is two districts, 75 and 63, this was a curious

4

one, because he actually found race did predominate in

5

75 by splitting Dinwiddie County -- Dinwiddie County

6

being a border county of North Carolina -- on a validly

7

racial grounds, but yet did not find race predominated

8

with respect to 63.

9

It's difficult to understand how race could

10

have predominated in the racial division of voters on

11

one side of the line, but not predominate in the racial

12

division of voters on the other.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but as to 75, did

14

he not say that strict scrutiny was met, because other

15

legitimate and -- and conventional factors were

16

considered and were present?

17

MR. ELIAS:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19
20

He did find -It seems to me that 75 is

the -- is the strongest case for the district court.
MR. ELIAS:

I think 75 is the strongest case

21

in the sense that the application of the wrong legal

22

test, he still found that we met -- that we met our

23

burden of -- of -- of predominance.

24
25

I think it is a weak finding on the part of
the district court in this regard, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

If you

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

look at what the actual evidence was to meet the strong

2

base of evidence -- because once -- once we found --

3

once predominance was found and strict scrutiny applied,

4

now the burden shifted to the government to explain why

5

they had a strong basis of evidence in doing what they

6

did.

7

Their strong basis of evidence was the

8

following:

9

like she would want more -- she -- she needed more

Number 1, that the elected official felt

10

African-Americans in her district.

11

respect to Delegate Tyler, most incumbents feel like

12

they would like more voters in their district who -- who

13

are going to support them.

14

not a -- that -- that -- it can't be a strong basis in

15

evidence.

16

Well, with all due

And that's not a -- that's

The second is they alluded to the fact that

17

there were prisons in the district.

18

interesting, because this is, Your Honor, exactly the

19

kind of racial stereotyping that the Voting Rights Act

20

is intended to avoid.

21

to the racial demographics of those prisons.

22

nothing to believe that those prisons included or

23

excluded, raise or lower, the overall black voting age

24

population of the district.

25

prison had 8,000 people, it had 8,000 black people.

And this is

There is nothing in the record as
There is

They assumed that if a

that is -- that is exactly the kind of racial

2

stereotyping that cannot form the basis.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Wasn't there a primary in

4

2005 in that district where Representative Tyler won

5

over a white candidate by less than 300 votes?

6

MR. ELIAS:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I'm glad

7

you raise that, because that's the third one, and that

8

is the most important one.

9

Let us take a step back, because it's --

10

it's interesting that he -- that he -- he won by more --

11

she won by more than -- by -- by only 300 votes.

12

The districts were drawn in two thousand --

13

in -- in two -- following 2000.

14

incumbent who had been there 30-some-odd years who was

15

a -- a candidate of choice of the African-American

16

community who won.

That candidate won again in a

17

landslide in 2003.

That candidate then retired, and it

18

was then an open primary.

19

Delegate Tyler won by five percentage points.

20

In 2001, there was an

And in that open primary,

Now, what's interesting is that 300 votes is

five percentage points.

22

proves predominance, well, she won in a landslide.

24

won five -- by five percentage points as a non-incumbent

25

in a multiple-primary field.

This was a 6,000-vote primary.

So to say she won by 300 votes and that

Alderson Reporting Company

She

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I thought she won by only,

like, 1 1/2 percentage points in the general.

3

MR. ELIAS:

4

So what happened next is that the incumbent,

In the general.

5

who had retired, whose son had run against her in the

6

primary, who she had beaten, he then endorses the

7

Republican opponent.

8

incumbent who endorses the Republican opponent, and she

9

wins by 1.3 percent of the vote in the general.

10
11

So you have this long-time

JUSTICE ALITO:

But these -- these districts

are going to last for a decade, are they not?

12

MR. ELIAS:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Correct.
And -- and there's no

14

guarantee that these same candidates are going to be

15

running throughout that decade.

16

MR. ELIAS:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

I agree.
So you think they have to

18

take into account this very complicated analysis:

19

it was the -- the person is an incumbent, and therefore

20

is going to have the incumbent's advantage, and --

21
22
23

MR. ELIAS:

Well,

No, Your Honor, I'm saying the

complete opposite.
I'm saying that in 2001, 2003, 2007, 2009,

24

this was -- this performed without a close election.

25

2005 the primary was not close; it was a five-point

In

election.

2

2005 general where she won by 1.3 percent of the vote.

3
4

So that leaves us one election, which was the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Which you're saying,

essentially, is idiosyncratic.

5

MR. ELIAS:

It's -- it's an idiosyncratic

6

one election.

7

it is a guarantee that they will win.

8

Gingles itself, there was a statement that it is not a

9

guarantee -- that no one election controls.

10

But also, this Court has never said that

It -- in fact, in

an interesting point.

12

confidence that it will remain a -- a majority-minority

evidence?

What -- to what -- what degree of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

25

SUPPORTING VACATUR IN PART AND AFFIRMANCE IN PART

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

3

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The district court was right to hold that

4

the use of a racial target is not sufficient to trigger

5

strict scrutiny, but it was wrong to hold that a

6

conflict with traditional redistricting principles is an

7

essential element of a racial gerrymandering claim.

8

On the use of a racial target, the Court's

9

cases have drawn a distinction between the use of race

10

as a factor and the predominant use of race in drawing

11

district lines, and the use of a racial target shows

12

that race was used.

13

Alabama, the -- when -- the critical question is whether

14

it was predominantly used.

15

that a racial target is used is evidence, but not

16

conclusive proof.

17

But as the Court explained in

And as to that, evidence

To take one example that I think you asked

18

for, if a district starts out 75 percent black voting

19

age population before it's redistricted, and that's

20

based on general demographic patterns, and then the

21

target is set at "don't drop below 50 percent," then

22

it's just not the case that district lines that are then

23

drawn to bring the district into compliance with

24

one-person, one-vote are necessarily going to be based

25

predominantly on race rather than traditional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

districting principles.

2

And if a racial target was alone sufficient

3

to trigger strict scrutiny, it would deprive the States

4

of the flexibility that they need to comply with the

5

Voting Rights Act.

6

So it's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Maybe I missed

7

your -- you're saying, if it was 75, and it's down to

8

50, that does not necessarily mean --

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No, I -- I -- I did not say

10

that.

11

go below 50, not that the target was it had to get to

12

50.

13

I -- I said if the target was that it shouldn't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

75.

15

as not yet below 50 --

Okay.

So it's at

And they say, what we're going to do, we draw this

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Right.
And then they --

And so they could end up

19

anywhere between 70 and 50.

20

end up right at 70, or at 65, or at 60, or at wherever

21

there is in between.

22

So it's just -- they could

So it's just not necessarily the case that

23

the use of a target may have had little or nothing to --

24

a target that that's -- that's so low at 50 percent when

25

you started up here at 75, then this -- the lines that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

you're drawing are probably likely to be drawn based

2

predominantly on traditional districting factors.

3

just not necessarily the case that you're going to have

4

to predominantly use race, because no matter what you

5

do --

It's

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So are those --

7

MR. GORNSTEIN:

-- you're going to end up

8

above 50 percent.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Are these the only kind of

10

districts where you would say that a target would not

11

have an impact on district lines?

12

the district has a population that's so far above the

13

target that nothing that they're doing on the margins is

14

affected by the target, are those the only kind?

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

In other words, where

No, I would not say that,

16

because I -- I would say districts, for example, like in

17

this case where you start at 60, there's no -- no

18

reason, necessarily, to think that race is going to

19

predominate in order to bring the districts into

20

compliance with the Voting Rights Act.

21

at 60.

22

redistricting factors and not on race, there's no reason

23

that it couldn't end up on -- at 60 for the same

24

reasons.

25

They started out

And let's assume, based on traditional

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if you started at 53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28

and you brought it up to 55?

2

MR. GORNSTEIN:

3

you on there.

4

more evidence than that.

Again, I -- I'm -- I'm with

It doesn't necessarily -- you would need

5

Now, the one that raises the biggest --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

More evidence of what?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, so -- so the most

7

That --

8
9

important evidence, Justice Alito, would be a conflict

10

with traditional redistricting principles.

11

could establish that and -- and that it went up to that

12

degree and it affected a substantial number of voters,

13

then I think you could make out a case.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if you

What if they said, well,

15

we're at 53; we have a 55 percent floor.

16

bring this up to 55, and we can do that by drawing a

17

district that's even more compact than the district that

18

we had before?

19

MR. GORNSTEIN:

We want to

So, ordinarily speaking,

20

it's going to be very difficult to show that race

21

predominated without showing a conflict with traditional

22

redistricting principles.

23

rule that says -- that -- that prevents a plaintiff from

24

trying.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But there's no hard-and-fast

When, then, can you?

Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

would be a case in which that might be possible?

2

theoretically possible, but you can imagine it

3

happening?

4

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Not

So I -- I we have two

5

examples in our brief, and -- and most of the cases I

6

can think of are -- are -- are but variations of those.

7

So the first relies on direct evidence from

8

the mapmaker himself, and the second is where the

9

State's nonracial explanation is discredited by the

10

evidence to be more concrete.

11

of thousands of predominantly white voters moved out,

12

tens of thousands of predominantly minority voters moved

13

in, and the mapmaker says, I did that to hit the target,

14

then a finding of racial predominance could be made even

15

if, Justice Alito, the -- the district was reasonably

16

compact.

17

If you have ten -- tens

And the -- the second example that I -- I

18

would -- from the brief is, if the State says politics

19

is what explains that, and then you look at the evidence

20

and they used racial data rather than political data,

21

then a finding of racial predominance could be made even

22

if politics is also playing a role; and there's no

23

conflict with politics in the drawing of the district --

JUSTICE ALITO:

There's no way --

25

MR. GORNSTEIN:

-- lines.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

And -- and maybe there's no

2

way around this; but this is all, as you -- as you lay

3

it out, very, very complicated.

4

legislature has to redistrict a huge -- a large number

5

of districts in a short amount of time using a very --

6

a -- a multifactor, vague predominance standard.

7

it turns out that there is predominance, what -- when

8

they will be deemed to have had a strong basis in

9

evidence to -- to -- that there would be a Voting Rights

10

And the State

And if

Act claim is also quite unclear.

11

So it's just -- maybe there's no way around

12

it, but it -- isn't this just an invitation for

13

litigation --

14

MR. GORNSTEIN:

So --

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. GORNSTEIN:

So we're very sympathetic to

instances?

19

20

traditional redistricting policies.

21

proposed a version of the conflict case test to the

22

Court in Miller.

23

And, in fact, we

But we read Miller and Shaw to -- to have

24

rejected this conflict requirement and -- and, instead,

25

to replace it to what a -- as you said, is a complicated

test about whether race predominated in the drawing of

2

district lines, even if traditional factors also played

3

a role.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is it still the

5

office's position that it would preferable to have the

6

test that was adopted by the district court here,

7

requiring a conflict before you find that race

8

predominated?

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

So putting aside the

10

question of whether it would -- you would -- overruling

11

the Court's --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I --

-- decisions, yes, except

14

that we wouldn't want that to bleed over into racial

15

vote dilution claims.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so your

17

objection to the court below is that it required a

18

conflict?

19

MR. GORNSTEIN:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct.
And in your brief,

21

you say, in the vast majority, your words, of cases, you

22

will need to show a conflict?

23

MR. GORNSTEIN:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Correct.
And you think

showing a conflict should be the correct legal standard,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

putting aside the decisions?

2

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, I wouldn't want to

3

urge the Court to overrule its decisions in --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

No, I know.

Putting

those cases --

6

MR. GORNSTEIN:

-- those cases -- for

7

that -- but putting aside, that is the position that we

8

advocated in -- in -- or a version of it in Miller.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

But in -- in -- in the

10

Alabama case, certainly what I tried to do, changing

11

what my position had been previously, in order to get a

12

court that would have a clear set of standards, on

13

page 1271 there are two paragraphs that address the

14

issue you're talking about, and they virtually say what

15

you say.

16

you're -- you're -- you're raising, we say that it has

17

to be a strong basis in evidence.

18

don't want to put the district court in a position, and

19

the legislature, to do the impossible, right?

20

And then at the end, to deal with the problem

That's because you

So it tries to do that.

That is the

21

decision of the Court.

22

that, there would be lots of lower courts that would

23

rely on that decision.

I had thought, that having done

Is it a good idea now suddenly to change and

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No.

I'm -- I'm not saying

2

you should go to a different test.

3

stare decisis considerations are what they are.

4

We would agree with

Pretty much.
What is it -- what

I think that what we said --

I think what we said are two

things.
One, that there -- that simply because you

use a racial target, you're not in strict scrutiny, and

23

that's from Alabama; and, two, a conflict is not

24

essential to prove a claim; but, three, there has to be

pretty strong evidence besides just the use of the

anything change?

I don't think the record would

12

support that characterization of the evidence, Justice

13

Kagan.

14

HD75, but it was also based on the testimony of Delegate

15

Dance, who's from -- from District 63.

16

as well, that it has to be north of 50 percent.

17

I think it was certainly based predominantly on

She testified,

It was also done in consultation with

18

Delegate Spruill, who's the delegate from District 77.

19

And it was based on not just the demographics in HD75,

20

though that was essentially the starting point, but also

21

based on the characterizations of the districts and the

22

voting tendencies --

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Isn't there something a bit

24

strange about this kind of rule?

25

that this kind of rule is the end all and be all.

And it's not to say

You -- it might be that you can have this rule and still

be absolutely fine in the way that Mr. Gornstein

districts and say that every single one of them ought to

5

meet the same BVAP standard without looking at the

6

characteristics of those districts, who's in them, how

7

they vote, I mean, it just -- it sort of defies belief

8

you could pick a number and say that applies with

9

respect to every majority-minority district.

10

But the idea that you would look at 12

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, I think

11

that maybe if you were picking one number for every

12

district in the state, from Big Stone Gap to Arlington,

13

maybe that would be the case.

14

apply one number to Latino districts in one part of the

15

State and African-American districts in another part of

16

the State, you might have a point.

17

are 12 districts, and there are four subregions, these

18

are all pretty much in the same part of the State.

19

all started on a benchmark map as somewhere between 46

20

and about 62 percent for starting.

21

this number comes out of thin air.

22

And if you're trying to

But although these

They

So it's not like

With respect to nine of the 12 districts,

23

they are already north of 55 percent and between, like,

24

55 and 62.

25

are at, like, 54 and 53.

Two of the other ones are very close.

They

And then one is a little bit

Alderson Reporting Company

lower, like 46, which is District 71, which I hope I'll

2

get a chance to talk about, because there, there is very

3

strong evidence that the redrawing was not done solely

4

on the basis of race.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. CLEMENT:

JUSTICE BREYER:

question on 71.

9

Let's talk about 71.

Sure.
Now, I have a particular

Remember what I was trying do.

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

The -- the Court's cases, at that moment,

12

At least in Alabama.

pre-Alabama, I -- I'm one of the problems.

13

Okay?

So I am trying to reflect what is actually

14

there in Miller, for better or for worse, and to make it

15

clear.

16

The column I've referred to talks really

17

about evidence showing predominance.

18

it?

19

that -- I think, in those two paragraphs.

20

was direct evidence that they moved 70 -- or 50,000 --

21

15,000 people are all black.

22

Does it or doesn't

And there are two things there that are crucial in
One, there

Okay?

Two, when you look at the three districting

23

traditional criteria, they are pretty weak as applicable

24

to that case.

25

to what they are talking about.

They just seem not to have much relevance

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.
Now, let's look at 71.

in.

7

out were three-quarters or something white, and the ones

8

they moved in were three-quarters or something black.

So that's pretty similar.

10

lot of attention to race.

Same kind of

They moved -- I don't know, you have it in the
They moved 11,293 people out and 17,000

So let's look at those people.

11

The ones they moved

It seems to me they paid a

Then they say, let's look at the traditional

12

criteria.

13

thing, they said that they -- they did it to keep it

14

preserved Richmond centered.

15

so it wasn't Richmond centered at all, and the changes

16

had nothing do with it.

17

The one they mentioned, which is this horn

But it already changed it

So what they are saying is in that case,

18

look at that specificity, and you will see that the

19

mistake of the judge in listing the criteria, you know,

20

his statement, overly broad or whatever, made a

21

difference, send it back, get him to do it right.

22
23
24
25

Now, that's a long question, but that's
designed to focus you.
MR. CLEMENT:

And I'm -- I'm glad to be

focused on District 71, because what the district court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

did is not apply any sort of cartoonish analysis.

2

looked at the district as drawn.

3

noticed is that it preserves 78 percent of the core of

4

the district, which is higher than the statewide average

5

of 70 percent.

6

being preserved, which is a traditional districting

7

principle.

8
9

He

The first thing he

So you have the core of the district is

He then looks at those horns, and he looks
at them, and he doesn't just look at them and say, well,

10

they look a little funny.

11

Delegate Jones, who drew the district, and he realizes

12

that the horns were drawn in order to preserve an

13

incumbent in the neighboring district so that that

14

incumbent could stay in her district.

15

He has direct testimony from

He then looks at Precinct 207, where he says

16

he doesn't want to get into conflicting testimony

17

between two -- two -- two delegates, and what he says, I

18

think absolutely correctly, is, this is a contiguous

19

precinct.

20

whether it's in or out, it conforms with traditional

21

districting principles.

22

It's 207; it's right on the border.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So

Suppose you have two

23

district -- or two possible districts.

24

look conventional.

25

same sense that you've been describing these multiple

Each of them

Each of them are conventional in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

factors.

2

But the stated reason, the stipulated reason

3

for choosing District A over District B is because it

4

has more voters of a certain race, black, Latino, white,

5

whatever.

6

Is that a predominant motive based on race?
MR. CLEMENT:

I would say that the right

7

answer to that in -- when -- for predominance within the

8

meaning of your Court's cases is no.

9

are two reasons --

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I think there

That -- and that's what

11

the district court says, and I have -- I have problems

12

with that, because predominance is designed to measure

13

intent when there are multiple causes, and in my -- in

14

my hypothetical, the hypothetical is, the -- the -- the

15

tipping point, the principal motivating factor was race.

16

And you say that because -- and the district court I

17

think said because the districts are conventional in all

18

other respects, strict scrutiny doesn't apply.

19

problem with that.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

Okay.

I have a

Justice Kennedy, I -- I

21

thought you might, but I'd like to say three things to

22

try to convince you in defense of the district court.

23

First of all, the -- when this Court says

24

"predominance," I assume they mean predominant over

25

something else.

And I think the "something else" is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

traditional districting principles.

2

predominates over those principles, those principles are

3

sacrificed.

4

way to make sense of this Court's cases.

5

They are subordinated.

So when race

I think that's the

Second of all, I think that if you apply the

6

test that way, what you are doing is you are mapping on

7

the test to the theory of a Shaw claim.

8

disagree with me on this, but I think the -- what makes

9

a Shaw claim a Shaw claim is not that somebody is kept

Now, you may

10

in a perfectly formed district in a community of

11

interest based on race.

12

Shaw claim is that people from different parts of the

13

State who would share nothing in common except the color

14

of their skin are grouped together in the same district.

15

That's what makes a Shaw claim different from other

16

kinds of claims.

17

It's the particular injury in a

And I completely agree with the Solicitor

18

General's office that in thinking about this question,

19

you should be thinking about Shaw claims and thinking

20

about them separately from vote dilution claims.

21

And I think there's a real problem in this

22

area of the law is what's happened is that Shaw, which

23

started as a doctrine for outlying districts in outlying

24

claims, has become the weapon of choice in redistricting

25

litigation, and people see Shaw violations everywhere.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

And that's just not the way that Shaw was originally

2

constructed.

3

dilution claim that can be brought that has a much

4

higher standard of proof, and people are essentially

5

trying to evade that --

It ignores that there is a separate vote

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

MR. CLEMENT:

8
9
10

But, Mr. Clement --- by bringing junior

varsity -- I'm sorry.
JUSTICE KAGAN:
MR. CLEMENT:

No, please.
People are bringing junior

11

varsity dilution claims under the guise of calling them

12

Shaw claims, and I think it's really distorted the law.

13

The third point, just to put it on the

14

table, is that at some point then you have to ask the

15

question -- if -- if you disagree with me on those first

16

two points and you actually think you have a different

17

conception of what a Shaw claim is, there still has to

18

be the question of is the game worth the candle given

19

the stated need to defer to State legislatures.

20

members of the House of Delegates voted in favor of this

21

plan because they -- it comported with traditional

22

districting principles and everybody wanted to preserve

23

majority-minority districts.

24

I'm sorry, Justice Kagan.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And 80

Just -- yeah, no, just going

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

back to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems pretty

2

clear to me that in the cases after Shaw -- because

3

Shaw, you could have looked at it as, this is all about

4

the way the district looks, and then in the cases after

5

Shaw, in Shaw II, and in Miller, the Court makes very

6

clear that it's not all about the way the district

7

looks, and indeed --

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:
there, though, and say:

But can I -- can I stop you
In Miller, what this Court

10

confronted was an argument that bizarreness is an

11

element of the claim.

12

nobody, I think, thinks that's the right answer.

13

And I think, you know -- and

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If you look at Shaw and

14

Shaw II and you look at Miller, and then you think about

15

the -- the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you,

16

which is essentially -- maybe I'll change it a little

17

bit -- it's essentially a mapmaker who says, look, we

18

really want to do race-based districting here.

19

manage to do this in a way where the maps look kind of

20

contiguous and kind of regularly shaped, but what we're

21

doing is race-based decision making.

22

We can

Now, it seems pretty clear to me that if you

23

look at Shaw II, if you look at Miller, that's

24

forbidden.

25

opposite of what the district court said here.

And -- and -- and that's exactly the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think that you have to

2

read those decisions in that way.

3

going to read those decisions in that way, it's

4

appropriate to pause and reflect where it's gotten us.

5

And I think that every one of those decisions starts out

6

by saying this is a very difficult task for State

7

legislatures.

8

districts without the Voting Rights Act, but to draw

9

them in compliance with the Voting Rights Act is

It's hard enough to draw districting --

10

exquisitely difficult.

11

State legislatures.

12

I think if you're

And we want to have deference to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, then I'm with

13

Justice Breyer, who suggested that a few years ago we

14

took those concerns into account and we tried to figure

15

out a test that was responsive to those concerns, and

16

that is not the test that the district court used here.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

I -- I beg to differ.

I think

18

you have to, as Justice Breyer was suggesting, at least

19

in the first 25 minutes, give the district court a

20

little more credit than that.

21

The district court had Alabama in front of

22

him.

23

think if you go back and look -- I mean, with all due

24

respect to my friends on the other side, they did not

25

argue this in terms of, let's look at all the people

He also had the arguments of the parties, and I

2

case.

3

evidence case based on the fact that --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

That was not the thrust of their

They really argued that this was a direct

That's -- that's what I

5

have to do after this argument, isn't it?

6

gave me exactly what I needed.

7

8

side, and -- and they -- they didn't use exactly the

9

right test, but does it matter?

I mean, you

You -- you gave me the

He gave me the things on the other

10

And -- and -- and I -- I think the -- the

11

reason I approach it that way is because this is such

12

a -- the reasons you said.

13

leeway here; leeway, leeway.

14

Okay.

You have to give

But the government makes a pretty good point

15

here that it -- that really was important evidence he

16

didn't look at.

17

isn't it, to go back and read these things and figure

18

out how they -- the -- the evidence.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

And -- and that's -- that's my job,

Absolutely.

But I think you

20

should -- I think you should look at the evidence in

21

this case, and you shouldn't look at the evidence that

22

could have been mounted.

23

evidence as it actually came in, the way it was argued

24

to the district court.

25

You should look at the

I think if you go and look, for example, at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

the closing arguments of this case, you will see that

2

the other side did not say, this is a case about moving

3

too many people in and out of a particular district.

4

They said, this is a direct evidence case.

5

you what the problem was.

6

to apply a 55 percent BVAP floor.

7

They told

They told you they were going

And that -- and so really, they tried to get

8

not just some tailwind from the fact that there was a

9

BVAP floor; they tried to make -- essentially rest their

10

case below on that proposition.

11

that, it left them with a vacuum in the evidence,

12

because we had extraordinarily good evidence on our side

13

of this case, because the principal map drawer, Delegate

14

Jones, testified for hours and hours about why

15

particular lines were drawn.

16

provided explanations for why they comported with

17

traditional principles.

18

And as a result of

And in every case, he

But not just that, he told you why the lines

19

were there.

20

have this 55 percent BVAP target and everything had to

21

go out the window.

22

in Southampton Roads, we have three incumbents that are

23

all close together because this part of the state lost a

24

lot of population.

25

keep the three incumbents separate, which I think is a

The lines weren't there because, oh, we

He said, well, you know, down here

So I drew some zigs and zags here to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

perfectly nonracial explanation for it.

2

Now, down in Delegate 77 -- in District 77,

3

that looks a little funny, but I got together with

4

Delegate Spruill, and Delegate Spruill said he wanted to

5

reunite the old city of South Norfolk, so we did that.

6

And that required to us move a couple of districts

7

around, and there it is.

8
9
10

There's -- there's reams of evidence of
that.

And there's really a vacuum of evidence on the

other side of this.

11

And I do want to sort of rewind the tape a

12

little bit, too, here, which is the reason it's so

13

problematic, I think, to think that just because they

14

applied a BVAP floor, you're, like, already

15

three-fourths of the way to applying strict scrutiny is,

16

what else is a State legislature supposed to do?

17

don't think in this context a BVAP floor is inherently

18

sinister.

I

19

And, I mean, one way of thinking about this,

20

Justice Kagan, is the Voting Rights Act itself is a BVAP

21

floor.

22

requires a majority-minority district, that's a

23

quantitative floor of at least 50 point --

24

plus .01 percent.

25

floor, that you have to preserve the ability -- ability

I mean, in those situations where it -- it

But everywhere, it's a qualitative

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

to elect.

2

And so there's nothing in this context --

3

and I think that's exactly why this Court has gotten

4

where it's gotten.

5

couldn't even further refine what you said in Alabama to

6

make it a little bit closer to where I think the law

7

should be in this area.

8
9

And I'm not so sure that you

But here's the point:

I mean, the reason

that, in this area uniquely, the Court allows race to be

10

considered is in part because the Voting Rights Act

11

makes the consideration of race absolutely necessary.

12

And I don't want -- think you want to send the signal --

13

I mean, unless you want to take the first steps towards

14

declaring the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional, you

15

don't want to send the signal that when legislatures

16

approach this in a way that I think is perfectly

17

appropriate to what's going on.

18

12 --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, Virginia's got

You absolutely don't,

20

Mr. Clement.

21

say, we view it as a core priority up there with

22

one-person, one-vote to comply with the Voting Rights

23

Act.

24

the legislature to do what it did, for example, in the

25

Alabama case, which is to just say something about there

But it's one thing for a legislature to

That's a terrific thing.

It's another thing for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

can't be any retrogression from whatever there is,

2

notwithstanding that that's just not Section 5 law, and,

3

similarly, it's another thing for the legislature to

4

just pick a number out of one district, apply it to all

5

12 districts, and say that that's compliance with the

6

Voting Rights Act.

7

Now, I agree with you and with Mr. Elias and

8

with Mr. Gornstein:

9

there.

That does not get you all the way

But there's something about -- this is --

10

Alabama suggested this was evidence.

11

across the board we're going to do something that just

12

on its face you know is not required by the Voting

13

Rights Act, that's a problem.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

When a State says

Well, I'm with a lot of what

15

you had to say, Justice Kagan.

16

with you is that there is something particularly

17

problematic about picking a 55 percent number and

18

applying it in Richmond and south and in the Hampton

19

Roads area.

20

about that.

21

I think where I'm not

And I think -- I mean, I'd say two things

I mean, in the universe of possible numbers,

22

55 percent's about the best number you could come up

23

with, because -- I mean, my friends on the other side

24

agree these all need to be majority-minority districts.

25

So if the whole debate is it's got to be somewhere north

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

of 50 percent, I mean, 55 percent, which gives you a

2

little bit of margin for the fact that there may be

3

differentials in -- in -- in turnout.

4

rubber's going to meet the road, remember, is on the

5

cases where -- I mean, you know, the incumbents are

6

going to always win.

7

majority-minority, but they're way majority Democrat.

8

So where the rubber is going to meet the road about

9

opportunity to elect is going to be in the open

And where the

And most of these districts are

10

primaries.

11

whether the African-American has -- community has the

12

opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice.

That's when you're really going to tell

13

Now, those are relatively rare.

14

idea that, you know, it's -- it's somehow presumptively

15

unconstitutional for the State to look at one of the

16

most recent open primaries in HD75 and say, well, yeah,

17

5 percentage points, but 5 percentage points in a badly

18

splintered primary, it's only 300 votes.

19

Tyler herself is saying, you know, these need to be

20

north of 50 percent.

21

that.

22

And so the

And Delegate

Everybody is basically saying

You know, I don't think it's fair to put

23

this -- and I guess this is where I really take issue.

24

I don't think it's -- I think it's a mistake to put this

25

in the same basket as Alabama.

The idea that you can't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

go from 80 to 79 percent is a cartoonish version of the

2

Voting Rights Act.

3

the 12 districts are already north of 55 percent, to say

4

that 55 percent is a pretty darn good threshold for

5

compliance with the Voting Rights Act just isn't in the

6

same category at all.

7

To say that in an area where 9 of

And I know they try to get a lot of sort of

8

mileage out of the idea of, well, it was

9

one-size-fits-all.

But the two things I would say about

10

that -- what I sort of already said -- which is we're

11

talking about the same part of the State, and there's no

12

reason to think there's a different dynamic in this --

13

and all of these districts are majority-minority

14

districts, African-American districts.

15

they're applying one rule and trying to say that it

16

fits, you know, for the -- for the complicated districts

17

in Northern Virginia with multiracial groups and those

18

districts down in the South.

19

districts.

20

It's not like

They're all very similar

That's one thing.
The second thing is -- I mean, keep in mind,

21

whatever rule you adopt here is not just for relatively

22

sophisticated State legislatures.

23

to all sorts of school boards and sewer districts.

24

There has to be -- I mean, I -- you know, I just don't

25

think the analysis is that you have to go district by

Alderson Reporting Company

It's going to apply

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

district with regression analysis in order to comply

2

with the Voting Rights Act.

3

rule you want to lay down.

I don't think that's the

4

And I also think -- and this is, I think,

5

responsive to Justice Kennedy's earlier question -- I

6

mean, the -- the -- the idea that they have on the other

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think the -- the real

21

difference between your standard and the SG's standard

22

is that in your standard, the shape of a district

23

functions as a threshold inquiry such that if the shape

24

is okay, we don't look at anything else, and

25

particularly we don't look even if the districting was

Well, Justice Kagan, first of

8

all, I think the real difference between our position

9

and the SG's position is a difference in the real world,

which is, they admit it's not going to make a difference

11

in 99 percent of the cases.

of these cases, it won't make any differences.

All right.

That's the dynamic that was 2011.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARC E. ELIAS
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ELIAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I want to clarify a few factual points and
obviously answer any questions you have.
The first is, the timing of this case

22

followed the Page decision.

23

that -- that ruled on the congressional map that then

24

was the -- it had nothing to do -- that case was filed

25

when there was a Republican in the Governor's Mansion.

It was the Page III court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

It had nothing to do with who was in the Governor's

2

Mansion, that just as a factual matter.

3

Justice Breyer, to your -- the question that

4

you posed to me earlier, and which is at the heart of

5

this, we completely agree with the analysis in Alabama

6

that -- that there needs to be a -- that you need to

7

show voters moved in and out on account of this rule.

8

And if you look at JA672, you will see there is a

9

50.8 percent differential between the white voters moved

10

out and the black voters moved in.

11

three-quarters of the -- of the -- of the voters moved

12

in were black, and --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. ELIAS:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

As you point out,

You make a point of that.
That -I mean, I think I heard

16

the -- Mr. Clement say that, well, no, this has all been

17

brought up after the case was over, and --

18

MR. ELIAS:

19

report from trial.

20

in the JA, because --

21
22
23
24
25

Your Honor, it's in our expert's

It's just not true.

JUSTICE BREYER:

You can find it

You called it to the

attention -MR. ELIAS:

-- we called it -- it was in our

expert's report at -- at trial.

Point number one.

Point number two, very quickly, this Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

58
1

in Shaw v. Hunt specifically dealt with Justice Stevens'

2

dissent, saying there should be an actual conflict test.

3

And what this Court said is, in his dissent, Justice

4

Stevens argues that strict scrutiny does not apply where

5

the State respects or complies with traditional

6

districting principles.

7

That, however, is not the standard

8

allowed -- announced and applied in Miller.

9

resolved for -- for this three-judge court well before

Shaw II

10

Alabama that an actual conflict test was not the law,

11

and the district courts here simply -- simply ignored

12

it.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

The case is submitted.

15
