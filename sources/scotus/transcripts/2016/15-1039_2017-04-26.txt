CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 15-1039, Sandoz v. Amgen.
Before we get started, Ms. Maynard,

6

Ms. Maynard and Mr. Waxman, the Court has decided to

7

give each of you five extra minutes, and you can

8

proceed, Ms. Maynard, when you're ready.

MS. MAYNARD:

Thank you, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 15-1039

12
13
14

MS.

MAYNARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Biosimilars Act created a comprehensive

15

and self-contained scheme for the early resolution of

16

patent disputes.

17

or sponsor take along the way, the end result is the

18

same, patent litigation.

19

comprehensive scheme as written.

20

elsewhere for consequences.

21

Regardless of the actions an applicant

Courts should apply that
They shouldn't look

I'd like to start with the issue in Sandoz's

22

petition, our petition, the notice of commercial

23

marketing issue, and then turn to the issue in Amgen's

24

petition, the -- the information exchange.

25

The Federal Circuit misread the notice of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

commercial marketing provision to provide sponsors a

2

180-day automatic stay that's nowhere in the statute.

3

That ruling will wrongly delay the marketing of every

4

biosimilar, even when there are no patent rights left to

5

be --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you tell me, suppose

7

that in year 2 of the 12-year exclusive period, the

8

application for the biosimilar is made.

9

year 4, there is eight more years to run, the

And then in

10

commission -- the FDA decides that it's going to approve

11

it.

Is it licensed at that time?

12

MS. MAYNARD:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

until the very end of the 12-day period.

15

MS. MAYNARD:

Well -Or is it not licensed

The FDA cannot license a

16

biosimilar until the end of the 12-year period.

17

and actually, a sponsor can't apply for a biosimilar

18

license until year 4, at the end of year 4.

19

practical matter, though, Justice Kennedy, it takes

20

eight to ten years to develop biosimilars, so it would

21

be very rare.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And --

As a

If it's done in -- if the

23

approval is done in year 6 or year 7, is that announced

24

publicly, that -- that the approval is done?

25

MS. MAYNARD:

The statute prohibits the --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

the -- the FDA from making an approval effective, and --

2

and that's in -- in the statute, Your Honor, at (k)(7).

3

It's the exclusivity provision that you're referring to.

4

It prohibits the FDA from making the license effective

5

until 12 years have run.

That's the exclusivity period.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MS. MAYNARD:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

I'm sorry.

They -Could you clarify?

Does

that mean that the FDA can't announce its intent to

10

approve on year 12 plus 1 earlier than year 12, or --

11

I'm not quite sure I understand.

12

How long does it take for the FDA to approve

13

the biosimilar?

14

there is -- and Phase II has been finished.

15

those run independent of the FDA approval, correct?

16

Assuming you go through Phase I, and

MS. MAYNARD:

That's right.

How long --

The information

17

exchange and the patent litigation process is completely

18

separate and de-linked from the FDA process.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how long -- I want

20

you to go back to Justice Kennedy, but I just want to

21

get a sense of timing.

22

for the FDA to say, this is okay effective 12 plus 1?

23

How long does it generally take

MS. MAYNARD:

So two points about that,

24

Justice Sotomayor.

25

said that it takes about -- they are aiming to try to

To answer your question, the FDA has

approve biosimilar applications within 10 months of

application.

contrast to the Hatch-Waxman Act, that expressly allows

the kind of tentative approval that I think both of you

5

are asking about.

6

But there's nothing in the -- this Act, in

And I think you may be asking about the --

the -- the fix that the Federal Circuit suggested for

8

the problem they've created in the --

18

when to announce that it's okay?
MS. MAYNARD:

It takes them 10 months.

Yes, Your Honor.

19

I'm trying to get the

Let's assume you put in

Do they have to wait until

They can't -- under the

20

statute, under (k)(7), they can't make it effective.

21

They can't make the approval effective until year 12.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When do they tell you

that they will?
MS. MAYNARD:

Well, there -- there's nothing

in the statute that calls for an approval before year

12.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, do they get a

phone call?

4

approved, but in five years, we're going to be able to

5

market.

They say, hey, good news, we've got it

I mean, how does it work?

6

MS. MAYNARD:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, Your Honor.
And then --

incidentally,

8

when you're talking about (k), is this in -- can you

9

give me the citation and the appendix to the --

10
11

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

So I'm

looking at -- it's in the blue brief --

1

expressly allow any tentative approval, unlike the

2

Hatch-Waxman Act, which does say you can call in advance

3

and say you're -- you're tentatively approved.

4

But even in the Hatch-Waxman Act, the -- the

5

-- the government doesn't consider it licensed, which is

6

the word in the statute in the marketing provisions --

7
8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I have one more

question --

9

MS. MAYNARD:

10

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- and then I'll -- and

11

then I'll subside.

12

this aspect of the process cuts against you insofar as

13

the 180 days' notice.

14
15

It seems to me that this process,

MS. MAYNARD:

I'm not sure I understand the

premise of your question, Justice Kennedy.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if -- the -- the 180

17

days has to run from some time, and it seems to me that

18

it has to run from the time that it's licensed --

19

MS. MAYNARD:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21
22

Well --- based on what you're

telling me.
MS. MAYNARD:

No, Your Honor.

So I'd like

23

to turn to the text then of the Notice of Commercial

24

Marketing Provision, because I think the text forecloses

25

that reading.

The text of the Commercial Marketing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

Provision has one and only one timing element.

2

requires notice at least 180 days before the date of the

3

first commercial marketing.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

It

But there is what you

5

already noticed about.

6

what it says is that you have to provide more -- no

7

later than 180 days, is notice of -- maybe -- it doesn't

8

even say this; it's not a complete sentence -- of the

9

first commercial marketing of the biological product

10
11
12

What does this notice say?

And

licensed.
Now, how could you do that if you don't know
what the product licensed is?

13

MS. MAYNARD:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -And I take it that they had

15

in the agency -- this goes to an agency, doesn't it?

16

And I have -- in the agency, they have the authority to

17

say, we will license this provided it's made this way,

18

but not that way; provided you do this kind of a check,

19

but not that kind of a check.

20

over what is licensed.

21

They have a lot of power

So how can you provide notice -- by the way,

22

maybe that isn't what notice means.

23

notice that you will commercially market X, or maybe it

24

means some combination thereof.

25

to that ambiguity -- which, to me, is a crucial

Maybe it just means

The reason that I point

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

ambiguity -- and it has to do with both your arguments,

2

indeed, all of them on both sides.

3

here, isn't there?

4

MS. MAYNARD:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is an agency

The FDA.

Yes, Your Honor.

All right.

Now, we are

6

being asked to interpret very technical provisions that

7

I find somewhat ambiguous and am operating in a field I

8

know nothing about.

9

implications for the future.

But it's going to have huge
So why isn't the way to go

10

about this case to ask the agency to issue some

11

regulations?

12

all will be able to argue that their interpretation

13

exceeds the statutory delegation.

14

would have a better picture.

15

Then when we see their interpretation, you

MS. MAYNARD:

And by doing that, we

Well, I think, Your Honor, to

16

take the text, which is where I think the Court should

17

look for the answer to this question --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MS. MAYNARD:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MS. MAYNARD:

Oh?

-- on page 39A.
Yeah, I've got it.

-- of the blue brief, is the

22

Notice of Commercial Marketing Provision.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

MS. MAYNARD:

25

Yeah.

And it says, as you read:

subsection (k) applicant shall provide notice to the

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

referenced product sponsor not later than -- so the --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MS. MAYNARD:

So --

-- not later than 180 days

4

before the date of the first commercial marketing.

5

the 180 days, Justice Breyer, modifies the date of first

6

commercial marketing.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MS. MAYNARD:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

But

Yeah, yeah, that's true.

Because of that -Provide the what?

What is

it you're to provide notice of?

11

MS. MAYNARD:

Of the biological product

12

licensed under subsection (k).

13

that phrasing to describe the biosimilar.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But this statute uses

But you just -- but you've

15

just said in answer to my question that the license

16

doesn't happen until 12 years plus 1.

17

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, the license can't happen

18

until 12 years plus 1, Justice Kennedy, but, like, right

19

now and for years to come, the exclusively period has

20

already run.

21

was here, we expect it to be licensed within 10 months

22

of application and were, in fact, licensed.

23

Sandoz gave the notice here and said we expect to be

24

licensed in the first quarter, second quarter of next

25

year, Sandoz was licensed.

And so when applications are made, as it

Alderson Reporting Company

So when

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

So if the -- if your questions earlier,

2

Justice Kennedy, were getting to does the applicant have

3

an idea how its application is faring, does the

4

applicant know when to expect it's going to get

5

approved, the answer to that is yes.

6

didn't show any concerns with litigation too early.

And Congress

7

So to your purpose question, Justice Breyer,

8

the purpose of this statute is to allow early resolution

9

of patent --

10
11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But Justice Breyer's

question was about agency regulations.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MS. MAYNARD:

That's right.

Thank you.

Well, with -- with respect,

14

Mr. Chief Justice, the United States is here explaining

15

its reading of the statute and agrees with our reading.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oddly enough, I -- I

17

would -- I would find an explanation far more convincing

18

as a layperson, if, in fact, there had been notice and

19

comment proceedings before an expert agency, which, in

20

fact, having heard all the different views on what that

21

word "notice" means, and having figured out whether if

22

we allow day one notice, what's going to happen is we're

23

going to gut the possibility of people going in and

24

making these exchanges, because everybody will be free

25

under the 23 -- under whatever this is 9 -- 9(a), to go

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

and start bringing declaratory-judgment actions.

2

somebody will make that argument, somebody will make the

3

opposite, and we'll know what we're doing.

4

So -- so that's the --

5

MS. MAYNARD:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

Well, we --- same thing the Chief

just said.

8
9

And

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, we -- we know -- we know

two things from the text of the statute, though, Your

10

Honor.

11

set by the Congress and said the FDA can make a license

12

effective at the 12-year point.

13

Circuit's reading is right, that license is not

14

effective, not effective in any case, even when there

15

are no patent rights until 12 1/2 years.

16

One is that the 12-year exclusivity period was

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If the Federal

Can I go back to the

17

beginning of Justice Breyer's question.

18

assumption that until the approval of the product, that

19

the other side won't know exactly what it is that's

20

going to be approved, particularly in a situation like

21

this, where you -- you've kept your application from

22

them so they don't have it.

23

Take -- address that issue.

He made an

In your brief

24

you say they can get it.

25

industry, from the SEC filings, from -- from FDA talk,

They can get it from the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

all of that stuff.

2

what it is that you're intending to market.

3

But that won't tell them exactly

So -- or the other side -- how -- how would

4

you know?

5

as you're entitled to do, wouldn't you know then?

6

Couldn't you get it in discovery?

7

If you start a declaratory-judgment action,

MS. MAYNARD:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And

8

that's our point.

9

consequence Congress provided when someone failed to

So -- so that's exactly the

provide notice or doesn't provide the application.

11

So here, Sandoz didn't provide its

12

application, as you note, and that allowed Amgen to sue.

13

That -- there are two acts of artificial infringement

14

created by the statute, both of which are key to

15

understanding the whole point, which is to allow

16

litigation based on the application.

17

application, just like in Hatch-Waxman, that

18

crystallizes the controversy.

19

situation -- and it provides two -- two acts of

20

infringement.

21

It's the

And so in the

And if I can just point to them, they are in

22

E(2)(c) of 271, so that's on page 5A.

23

instance where the parties engage in the information

24

exchange, which applicants are highly incentivized to

25

do.

One is in the

If -- if there's any fear of any patents that might

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

block their product, an applicant is going to go through

2

the information exchange, because it gives --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could it -- could the

4

company with the product file a declaratory-judgment

5

action when they don't know what you're going to do?

6

they have a good-faith basis for believing you're going

7

to infringe if they don't have the application to look

8

at until they get discovery?

9

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

MS. MAYNARD:

Okay.

Do

So --

Tell me how.
Well, first I want to

12

say, Congress obviously thought they did, because it

13

created, in the text, an artificial-infringement act for

14

that very thing.

15

Two, and they're right.

By definition, a

16

biosimilar is highly similar to the reference-product

17

sponsor's product.

18

have good-faith basis in that case to bring suit on any

19

patent that covers its own product, or any patent that

20

covers a use of its own product.

21

So a reference-product sponsor would

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it doesn't know

22

the specifics of the biosimilar.

23

the biosimilar is similar; it's not identical.

24

whether or not it infringes might have something to do

25

with the ways in which it is different.

I mean, by definition,

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

MS. MAYNARD:

It might, Your Honor.

But the

2

question is whether or not you have a good-faith basis

3

to sue.

4

the kind of similarities there have to be, if the

5

sponsor has any patent that covers its product, this

6

product itself or any uses of the product, it would have

7

a good-faith basis to sue, which is exactly what Amgen

8

did here.

9

And given the standard of highly similarity and

Well, you're suing

10

saying, this thing infringes our patent.

11

know what "this thing" is.

12

MS. MAYNARD:

We don't even

You know that -- that the

13

applicant has submitted to the FDA using your data to

14

produce a product that's highly similar to your product.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is the way this statute

16

works, Ms. Maynard, that if I have a valid patent, I

17

sue?

18
19

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes, exactly, Justice

Kagan.

20
21

Yes.

JUSTICE KAGAN:
know.

Is that it?

I mean, I don't

I'm asking.

22

MS. MAYNARD:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

So if --

But just, is the practice

24

that given that these will all be similar, if I have a

25

valid patent, I bring litigation?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

MS. MAYNARD:

Right.

Exactly.

And Congress

2

provided for this exact situation in (e)(2)(C), which is

3

on 5A of our blue brief, made an -- someone applying and

4

not providing the application within 20 days made that

5

precise act an act of infringement, and you would have a

6

good-faith basis to sue, as they did here.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You would not -- I

8

don't know if I agree with you on that.

9

have to sue.

But you would

That's the problem; right?

What would the

10

patent litigation look like?

11

bringing this biosimilar; I'm going to sue you.

12

litigation would decide whether the biosimilar infringes

13

the patent, and that would have something to do with

14

whether or not it's sufficiently -- whether it's too

15

similar or whether it's certainly distinct.

16
17

I have this patent; you're

And what your argument means is that if you
have the patent Justice Kagan said, you have to sue.

That is exactly what Amgen did

here.

7

So this is the only situation in which I'm aware

8

where --

And I want to emphasize that in most situations,

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

If the

10

biosimilar files a notice of intent to file the

11

application and a copy of the application, if it

12

complies with all of the steps in Phase 1, does it estop

13

the bio -- the -- the licensed product holder from

14

seeking a declaratory-judgment action?

15

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

And so if --

16

for -- until you get to a certain point in the process;

17

right?

18

applicant does provide, so does participate in the

19

information exchange, then they go through a

20

back-and-forth exchange.

So if the -- the way that it works is if the

21

During that period of time, the -- the

22

(l)(9)(A) bar -- if you'd like me to walk you through

it, I can explain why -- so but the (l)(9)(A) bar would

24

bar anybody bringing declaratory action during that

consequence if they -- if -- to answer your question, if

22

the -- if the sponsor doesn't follow through on the

information exchange and then doesn't file the (l)(6)

24

lawsuit, so (l) -- at stage (l)(6), it says the sponsor

25

shall sue within a certain period of time.

Alderson Reporting Company

If the

sponsor doesn't bring that suit, it's limited in any

future infringement suit to reasonable royalties.

That's the provision in (e)(6)(A) of 271 on 8A.

And I think -- but this is one whole

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's complicated to be sure, but Congress

What about Patent and

Well, just to clarify to

the -- Mr. Chief Justice's questions and Justice

authority to interpret these provisions.

22

25

I think this is a statutory interpretation
And I think the text answers -JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

But you don't

2

There are many situations where you defer to an agency's

determination that can have informal -- you know, you

with the idea of the FDA doing this first, but maybe I

6

can't get there.

7

So -- so -- so I -- I would stick

And if I can't get there, I'm stuck.

MS. MAYNARD:

I think the text answers these

questions that I'm being asked.

9

May I go back and answer Justice Ginsburg's

10

question about the -- the way that the two phases work?

11

First, Your Honor, there's not always two phases.

12

even if the parties engage in the information exchange,

13

it contemplates -- it gives the sponsor -- I mean, the

14

applicant a great deal of control.

litigation.

The applicant can

23

So

There are no patents left, yet Apotex

So -- and the purpose of the notice of

25

that it lifts the gate.

So once the parties go through

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

The Congress enacted a detailed process for

4

early resolution of patent disputes through patent

5

infringement litigation while FDA is evaluating a

6

biosimilar application.

7

establishes a series of procedural steps, and then

8

specifies the consequences for both the applicant and

9

the sponsor if they fail to take the steps that would

The statute expressly

set you off the -- the (l) path.

11

consequences address the timing and the scope of patent

12

litigation.

13

And all of those

Those consequences, which are quite

14

detailed -- we don't have the time to talk about all of

15

them, but they're in the statute, they're in our

16

brief -- are the exclusive consequences.

17

it would muck up the statute for courts to come in and

18

start policing each step of the (l) dance and then send

19

the parties back.

It would be --

Now, this -- this means that the agency

MR. YANG:

Close.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

All right.

Well, let me

MR. YANG:

Well, I believe Sandoz argued, at

But putting that to aside, the Federal Circuit in this

Apotex, and so where we are now is only on the question

13

of the Federal remedy, if there is one, for failing to

give notice or failing to comply with the information

That's precisely what the Federal Circuit

I will say that it --

That's certainly not

Amgen's position, so --

19

MR. YANG:

I will say that there are -- I

20

think there are strong arguments that this would be

21

preempted.

22

States were to start to interject different means of

23

enforcing it on a State-by-State basis, that might wreak

24

some havoc, but we've not taken a position on that.

25

This is a highly detailed scheme.

And if

MR. YANG:

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Here we -I agree with you, but the

absence of any argument on preemption is what makes it

4

so curious.

5

MR. YANG:

Well, the judgment below did not

rest on the State law claim.

7

page 24 and 25 is where it says it's moot, it rests on a

Federal law.

9

Again, if you look at

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but it rests on

10

a Federal law cause of action that also might not be

11

there.

12

seems to me that it's very hard to give a comprehensive

13

answer to the questions presented without considering

whether, well, thanks for your opinion on what Federal

law does, but, in fact, State law, you can get the same

3

The case is about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think that --

4

do you think the statute can function in the way you're

5

arguing, even if there are injunctions?

6

State law provisions?

7

MR. YANG:

Based on the

Can the statute work?

I think it

8

would mess up the scheme that Congress -- because if you

9

were to look at "shall," you know, there's -- there are

10

eight subsections, that's clauses of -- of subsection

11

(l).

12

no, no, no, you didn't give sufficient information, you

13

didn't do that, you'd have a series of back and forth in

14

the scheme.

15

at certain points, if you don't do something, boom, you

16

bump out, you're in litigation.

If at each stage a court is policing and saying,

17

The whole idea is you go along a path, and

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -So you're asking us,

assuming, just an assumption for the sake of argument,

that we rule in your favor and say, as you've asked us

18

That's --

19
20
21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If it's not preempted,

how would it be mooted?
MR. YANG:

It would just fail, just like on

22

(l)(2), the Federal Circuit said, you're complying with

23

Federal law, therefore, you have no State law claim,

24

because your State law claim is predicated on violating

the Federal law.

It would be the same for both.

So the reason --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that begs the

question on the question we're not looking at, but it

begs the question on point 2 -- on the first point which

is, is it a requirement that the biosimilar applicant

information exchange occurs, is to have all patent

5

litigation concluded before commercial launch.

6

is, in fact, what was said over and over again.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You still

haven't answered my question.

9
10

No, no, no.

And that

MR. WAXMAN:

I'm -- I'm just getting warmed

up.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're assuming --

12

you're assuming commercial launch has to be 12 years

13

plus 6.

14

MR. WAXMAN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

Well --

commercial launch should be 12 plus 1 --

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19
20

I'm assuming that

So let me --- because you only have

an exclusive license for 12 years.
MR. WAXMAN:

So let me address that, the 12

21

years plus 6 months first, and then go to the point of

22

why the notice of commercial licensing has to -- can

23

only coherently be done once the FDA has announced what

24

molecule has been approved for what therapeutic uses and

25

by what manufacturing processes, which is the paramount

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

importance when you're talking about biosimilars.

2

So as to the 180 -- the 12 versus 12 and a

3

half years, the FDA -- no one has yet applied for

4

biosimilar licensure until long after the 12 years has

5

ended.

6

will address a license application that is made during

7

the 12-year period.

So we don't know when the FDA -- how the FDA

8

But two panels of the Federal Circuit have

9

read the language of the statute that says -- and this

10

is 262(k)(7) -- that FDA's approval of a biosimilar may

11

not be made effective until 12 years -- until 12 years

12

of data exclusivity has run.

13

Circuit have said that only means made effective.

14

FDA certainly could adjudicate a license and grant a

15

license effective 12 years after, you know, the

16

exclusivity period runs.

Two panels of the Federal

17

The reason --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

The

That strengthens my

argument.

20

MR. WAXMAN:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -Because if the FDA is

22

taking that position, then it's basically kicking off

23

the possibility of round 2 pretty early.

24
25

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

Now, the -- as -- as my

friend on the other side pointed out, the notion that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

there is going to be round 2 litigation very early in

2

any event is unlikely for the following reasons.

3

Number one, as they've reported, it takes

4

about 10 years, even for a biosimilar, to get developed.

5

And, you know, Amgen is both a reference product maker

6

and a biosimilar maker, and that's, in fact, consistent

7

with our experience.

8

to be, you know, an application filed in year 4 or year

9

6 or year 8 is unlikely.

10

So the notion that there's going

Another reason that it's unlikely is

11

these -- these biosimilars -- you know, up until very,

12

very recent advances in gene sequencing, biosimilars

13

were -- the way they were defined was by the process

14

under which they were made.

15

line and then you do the following 18 things at this

16

atmospheric pressure.

17

You take a particular cell

And the FDA will not approve a biosimilar

18

until it has inspected the manufacturing process and

19

facilities, which, according to the record, take -- is

20

about 100 or $200 million.

21

biosimilar is going to create a whole factory for the

22

FDA to review and then leave it open for -- until year

23

12 is quite unlikely.

24
25

And the notion that a

The -- the issue here, even if the FDA took
the position that, nope, even though the statute only

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

says that approval can't be made effective, we're not

2

even going to tip our hand until 12 years is over, it

3

still wouldn't defeat the manifest purpose of the

4

statute.

5

This statute, like the Hatch-Waxman Act, has

6

two relevant periods.

7

exclusivity that is the period in which a competitor

8

can't use the sponsor's data.

9

market exclusivity.

There is a period of data

That's not a period of

In fact, there is a competitor to

10

the product at issue in this case that's been on the

11

market for five years because Teva went through the

12

regular 271(A) process.

13

a period in which there's data exclusivity.

14

have a period, just like in Hatch-Waxman -- there it's

15

30 months, here it's 180 days -- for the adjudication of

16

any patent disputes.

17

So we have, as in Hatch-Waxman,
And we then

Now, my friends on the other side say, well,

18

this is different because in the Hatch-Waxman context,

19

the FDA actually approves, and then the 30-month period

20

for patent litigation occurs, whereas here, the FDA's

21

approval leaves aside the question of when they can or

22

can't approve it.

23

sometime after the 12 years has run, there's an

24

additional 180 days.

25

If they don't approve it until

We don't know that because this has never

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

happened.

2

Congress -- the reason why you have to have FDA -- the

3

FDA say what's being approved, whereas in Hatch-Waxman

4

you don't, is in Hatch-Waxman we are talking about a

5

small molecule that has to be identical.

6

chemical synthesis, so there's no question.

7

But even if it did, the reason why

It's made by

When -- when a generic asks for Hatch-Waxman

8

approval, we know precisely what the molecule is.

9

know precisely for what therapeutic purposes it will be

We

10

used because it has to be identical, and no one cares

11

what the manufacturing process is because this is simply

12

chemical synthesis of an identical molecule.

13

Whereas -- and this goes to Justice Breyer's

14

question about notice -- until the FDA decides what it

15

is, what is the compound that it is going to

16

authorize -- which, by definition, won't be identical --

17

and until it decides for what therapeutic purposes that

18

will be used, and until it specifies what the

19

manufacturing process in what location will be approved,

20

you can't give notice of anything.

21

And, if -- in fact, if you look again, we're

22

on the 180-day notice provision, subsection (a) of

23

262(l)(8), which -- I'm sorry, I'm looking at my own

24

appendix, but it's on page 31A of -- of my appendix.

25

The -- (8)(a) says the Notice of Commercial Marketing.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

Subsection (b), entitled Preliminary Injunction, tells

2

you the most important consequence of (8)(a) -- and this

3

does go again, I think, Justice Sotomayor, with respect

4

to your question about how soon this can be done -- that

5

(8)(a) notice, first and foremost, allows the sponsor,

6

for the very first time, to seek a preliminary

7

injunction against the commercial marketing of the

8

product for the uses using the processes.

9

And you cannot go to a Federal district

10

court and ask for a preliminary injunction until you

11

know, A, that there's an imminency that occurs.

12

can't go years in advance.

13

is that you are seeking to enjoin.

14

there's some artificial act of infringement that relates

15

to whatever you may or may not know is in the original

16

application for Article III purposes is irrelevant.

17

You

B, you have to know what it
This notion that

I mean, once the FDA -- the -- the question

18

is can you get an injunction against what is approved

19

for what purposes using what processes.

20

that, a court doesn't have a way of evaluating --

21
22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

How -- how many

times --

23
24

Until you know

MR. WAXMAN:

-- what it is that's being

enjoined.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

How often is the

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

issue the validity of the patent rather than its

2

infringement?

3

MR. WAXMAN:

We don't have a sufficient data

4

set to be able to evaluate it because, you know, in the

5

seven years that this Act has been in place, the FDA has

6

accepted for review only 14 of these applications and

7

has only granted 5 of them, the last one being last

8

Friday.

9

And so in some of them, there have -- you

10

know, for example, Amgen got approved -- biosimilar

11

approval for its biosimilar to AbbVie's referenced drug

12

Humira.

13

180-day notice yet, and so we haven't started commercial

14

marketing.

15

biosimilar will wait until the expiration of the regular

16

relevant patents.

17

We got that last year.

We haven't given the

And it could be because some -- often, the

It also can be that there is this -- this

18

litigation occurs, Phase I, Phase II, or whatever, and

19

that there is then a settlement, which is, in fact, what

20

happened between Amgen's referenced product in this

21

case, and Teva's competitor.

22

was litigation and the litigation was settled.

23

We -- there was -- there

So -- but the -- the point here -- and if I

24

can just -- maybe this -- this is a -- is a good point

25

to shift to the (l)(2)(A) issue, which is the -- the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

requirement that you provide that once the -- once the

2

applicant decides not to go the regular route, that is,

3

the A route, that is, to -- to do all the testing and

4

prove that this is safe, potent, and pure, but instead

5

to piggyback onto the referenced products, once that's

6

done, the statute says -- not only in (2)(A), but also

7

in (1)(A) -- says that you must -- once you make that

8

choice, the consequence -- the consequence of using the

9

referenced-product sponsor's data is, if I can just

10

quote (1)(B), quote, "When a subsection (k) applicant

11

submits an application under subsection (k), such

12

applicant shall provide a copy of its application and

13

information about its manufacturing process."

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And --

Mr. Waxman, let's say --

15

let's say I spot you that, okay, that (2)(A) "shall"

16

means shall.

All right?

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.
But the question still

19

remains under (l)(9) -- (9) -- (9)(C), rather,

20

(l)(9)(C), what the remedy is.

21

other side that the exclusive remedy is a

22

declaratory-judgment action.

23

decide what (2)(A) means without taking a peek at (9)(C)

24

as to what remedies are permitted?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

And we've heard from the

And how can we possibly

Well, what -- I mean, we agree

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

with the government that when (2)(A) says "shall," and

2

when (1)(B) says "shall," that is a mandate.

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

4

MR. WAXMAN:

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

6

Okay.
-- for purposes of this

question.

7
8

I'm spotting you that --

MR. WAXMAN:

I just want to make sure

that --

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You can't -- it's hard to

10

divorce a right from its remedy, isn't it, and to

11

understand the contours of the right.

12

gives you a certain right to information, we usually

13

understand the right in the context of the remedy

14

provided.

15

MR. WAXMAN:

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

17
18

And if (2)(A)

So -And here the remedy is

(9)(C).
MR. WAXMAN:

So let me -- can I bookmark the

19

State law cause of action, because I do want to get back

20

and explain why --

21
22
23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

However -- however best

you want to do it.
MR. WAXMAN:

Our -- okay.

Let me do State

24

law first, which is what was at issue and was

25

adjudicated here, and then go to the Federal law issue.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

So the litigation -- the complaint in this

2

case asked for an order under the California statute.

3

The California statute, like many other State statutes,

4

including the one that was directly at issue in your

5

decision in Bates v. Dow Agroscience, makes it a

6

violation of State law to fail to comply with Federal

7

mandates, including this one.

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

MR. WAXMAN:

10

I -- I got that.

Okay.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm sorry.

My question is

11

how can we understand what a violation is, of Federal

12

law, without looking at both the rights section and the

13

remedy section?

14

MR. WAXMAN:

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, the -Because the -- a violation

16

is circumscribed in a certain way here by the remedies

17

provided by Federal law.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

Well -- so I don't -- this may

19

be a definitional failure of communication, but "shall"

20

either means "shall."

21

who, if anybody, can do anything about it, if you don't

22

comply with "shall," right?

23

The remedy question is who --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That -- that's -- no.

24

It's not quite that.

25

this Federal process, this is what you have to do.

"Shall" is if you want to invoke

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

MR. WAXMAN:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.

So -All right?

So if you

3

don't invoke the Federal process, what remains?

4

not a remedy.

5

declaratory-judgment process.

6

That's

That's a different Federal process, the
That's what (C) says.

Under your reading, (B) and (C) become

7

superfluous, because if you can get a State law

8

information-exchange provision under (C) or -- or under

9

State law, why give the remedy of starting a

10

declaratory-judgment action at all?

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

All right.

So let me go

12

right to Section 9.

13

Section -- you have to look -- what Section 9 says.

14

(9)(C) is, if you will, an exception or a clarification

15

of (9)(A).

16

has established an artificial act of infringement, which

17

is the submission of the ABLA, the submission of the

18

biosimilar application.

19

I'm not trying to avoid it.

The background principle is that Congress

That is actionable.

There is a Federal

20

cause of action under Section 281, which gives Federal

21

district courts jurisdiction to adjudicate patent

22

disputes.

23

Court's decision in MedImmune v. Genentech, you can

24

bring a declaratory judgment any time you want so long

25

as there is a level of immediacy, which, by definition,

Under the Declaratory-Judgment Act and this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

there is, if an artificial act of infringement has

2

already occurred.

3

Now, what (9)(A) says is notwithstanding

4

those background rules, if the biosimilar applicant

5

chooses the (k) route and provides the application and

6

the manufacturing information, we're making an exception

7

to the general availability of declaratory judgments.

8

No one can file a declaratory-judgment action until the

9

notice of commercial marketing is given.

10

What (9)(C) simply does is it has -- (9)(C)

11

says if you don't provide that (2)(A) information, you,

12

the applicant, can't ever file for a

13

declaratory-judgment action, but (9)(C) doesn't remedy

14

the sponsor's harm for two reasons.

15

no real operative effect with respect to the sponsor,

16

because recall what (9)(A) -- the (9)(A) limitation is

17

implicated, as the first clause indicates, only in those

18

circumstances in which the application and the

19

manufacturing information is provided.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. WAXMAN:

No.

Number one, it has

I think it does.

And (9)(C) simply confirms what

22

is -- what should be obvious, which is if it isn't

23

provided, the sponsor is left to his background rights

24

to -- to litigate the declaratory-judgment action.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

So why haven't you driven

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

us to the following conclusion, which will be

2

unsatisfactory, again, from everybody's point of view?

3

We said you're right --

4

MR. WAXMAN:

5

Setting the bar pretty low for

me.

6

(Laughter.)

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're right.

"Shall"

8

means "shall."

9

first, the Federal part, which you just read, doesn't

Okay?

But let's stop there because,

10

say that's the only remedy or that there are others.

11

But even if it did, we wouldn't know whether California

12

law picked up just the substantive part, or the

13

substantive plus the remedy.

14

we wouldn't know whether some other State would be free

15

to pick up in their own State law "shall," but not

16

exclusivity as to remedy.

17

preemption questions, or questions of interpretation of

18

State law, and none of that is briefed.

19

we stop.

20

No, you don't, but tell me why not.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

And even if we knew that,

And those involve either

"Shall" means "shall."

And, therefore,

How do you like that?

I -- no.

I like -- I like

22

"shall means shall."

23

to -- to the -- make the (9)(C) point, but let me

24

address your State law question first.

25

I -- I still want to get back

We know, without question, the California

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

Supreme Court in Rose v. Bank of America and the

2

Solicitor General's Amicus brief to this Court in that

3

case, makes clear what California says.

4

is not incorporating into State law Federal remedies.

5

It says it is a violation of our State law, fair

6

commercial practices law, to violate a command of

7

another sovereign's law.

8

That establishes the --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

California law

Well, that is fine.

10

But we also have pretty well-established preemption

11

laws.

12

statute with enormous consequences, and you're reading

13

along and you finally figure it out, and all of a sudden

14

up pops California law.

15

MR. WAXMAN:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would -- you know, this is a very reticulated

Well -And not only that, I

17

mean, if we apply California law, then, presumably, in

18

some circumstances, we apply the law of every other

19

State and maybe they reach different consequences.

20

if as your friends on the other side are right, that

21

there's no Federal cause of action for this type

22

of relief, then it seems odd to say but there's going to

23

be -- you get the same thing under State law.

24
25

MR. WAXMAN:

And

Well, let me -- let me address

that head on.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1
2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not to prejudge the

issues, maybe.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

First of all, the preemption

4

question, there's no ambiguity about whether preemption

5

was waived.

6

At page 26A of the petition -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, no.

I

7

understand that, but I'm not going to interpret a

8

Federal statute based on the decisions of one party to

9

waive the argument or not.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

I completely understand that.

11

In Bates v. Dow Agroscience, the Court rejected my

12

argument that the -- the farmer in question had a remedy

13

under, I believe, it was Texas State law for the

14

violation of a substantive -- Texas State law made a

15

violation of State law a violation of a substantive

16

provision of the Federal FIFRA statute.

17

that case for the defendant that Congress had considered

18

what remedies, if any, to provide to individual farmers

19

and had made an advertent decision not to provide any.

20

This Court pretty emphatically rejected my

And I argued in

21

argument and said that because Texas had made it a

22

violation of Texas law to fail to comply with a

23

provision of the Federal FIFRA, the plaintiff could get

24

a remedy available under Texas law.

25

Now, here, I mean, the -- there's nothing --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

I mean, I -- I agree that we -- you know, it's somehow

2

unsatisfying to say, well, the only -- the injunction

3

that was sought, the order that we went in to say, look,

4

you have to order them to give us this manufacturing

5

information and give us notice at a time when it's

6

coherent to talk about notice about what, and we -- the

7

only remedy that the California statute provides is

8

injunctive relief.

9

And we're entitled to this.

10

They're violating our laws.

11

It doesn't allow for damages at all.
We're a California company.

I understand that it's unsatisfactory and

12

that, ultimately, some day perhaps, this Court will have

13

to decide whether it's -- whether there is a Federal

14

enforcement, even if State law didn't exist, although I

15

do want to suggest that if this Court says, look,

16

"shall" means "shall," and you must if you -- if you

17

choose to -- to parachute onto the back of their

18

information, you have to at least let them know that

19

you're doing it and what you're doing.

20

give them notice in time --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. WAXMAN:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And in order to

But that --

-- for a court to --- that -- really, the

24

State law would end up, under your theory, forcing a

25

biosimilar to invoke Phase I.

Because at every stage,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

you -- where they choose to opt out, they -- you will

2

just run to court and say, my State law remedy is force

them to take the next step.

4

then identify, then do this.

5

no longer a choice.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Give me the application,
You're going to -- there's

So, Justice Sotomayor, two

points.

shouldn't all this patent litigation be done early and

9

often, everybody understands that the applicant, the

Number one, in terms of shouldn't all this --

11

process alone decides which patents at issue in the

exchange of lists are going to be adjudicated.

13

patent -- the applicant announces -- the applicant can

14

say to the sponsor, in Phase I, we're going to litigate

15

all of the patents that are on the (l)(3) lists.

16

only qualification is if the -- if the applicant says,

I'm not going to -- I don't want to litigate any of

18

these things now.

patent, presumably the patent on the molecule itself, to

hands to get all of this litigation on artificial acts

What you're not telling

me is, it's no longer a choice --

-- for the applicant to

injunctions to participate unwillingly.
MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

Let me -- let me go back

16

to (9), which I think is the source of Sandoz's argument

17

that the statute already provides remedies for the two

18

violations that we allege occurred here.

19

And if I may, let me -- let me address the

20

two substantive provisions differently, because they say

21

that (9)(B) is the remedy for a violation of the 180-day

22

notice, and (9)(C) is a remedy for the violation of not

23

providing the information.

24
25

The notion that (9)(B) is a remedy for the
failure to provide 180-day notice is -- is crazy.

The -- what (8)(A) says is, you can't file a

2

declaratory-judgment action until you get the notice.

3

And what they say is, well, but the remedy of not giving

4

notice is that you can file a declaratory-judgment

5

action.

6

declaratory-judgment action and you must file a

7

declaratory-judgment action at a time when you don't

8

know when, if ever, the FDA will approve, what it will

9

approve, or for what purposes and by what means.

And not only that, you can file a

And if

10

there is a violation of the 180-day notice period, the

11

first time that the -- the sponsor is going to know

12

about it is when the FDA approves.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, what's -- what's

14

wrong with that?

15

defective and seek a declaratory judgment on that basis,

16

that the notice is insufficient, doesn't provide you

17

with adequate notice as required by statute?

18

Why can't you argue that the notice is

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, that -- that, of course,

19

is exactly what we claim.

20

to give us notice the day after they --

They gave -- they purported

We

said, that's not valid, that's not the right time.

question -- I'm separating out the substantive question

25

of when notice has to be given --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I understand that.

If

you --

3

MR. WAXMAN:

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- and the remedy.
If you say the notice

5

itself is defective, apart from when it's given, because

6

it doesn't provide enough information, isn't that a

7

possible remedy right there?

8

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, yes.

In an instance in

9

which -- the notice simply says we are going to begin

10

commercial marketing in 180 -- no less than 180 days.

11

Our -- the -- you know, the issue in this case is -- the

12

substantive issue -- I'll leave aside the enforcement

13

question -- is that's not notice.

14

something, you can't provide notice of something when

15

you don't even know it's going to happen.

16

notice ordinarily and, for that matter, logically

17

implies that the preconditions that are outside your

18

control have been satisfied.

19

In order to notice

That is,

If I say -- this notice early tells you

22

immediately.

I don't know whether they will approve my

23

application.

I don't know, if they approve it, whether

24

they will change the substance, whether they will change

25

the indications.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But isn't that true of a lot

2

of what this Act contemplates?

3

litigation can occur before the approval is given.

4

MR. WAXMAN:

I mean, all the round 1

That's right.

And that's the

5

reason why you have to have -- that's why (8)(A) has

6

to -- the notice has to come at a time when we know what

7

it is that's approved.

8

choose --

9

That is, the parties may

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I guess what I'm saying

10

is that it seems as though this statute contemplates

11

that you can do a lot of this process prior to the

12

approval, but that's not a necessary piece of

13

information you need in order to start evaluating

14

whether there's infringement.

15

MR. WAXMAN:

So, Justice Kagan, the -- let's

16

say Phase I starts.

17

talk about what happens -- their remedy for not

18

providing the -- the (l)(2) information at all.

19

let's say the parties decide, okay, we've -- we've each

20

listed all of these patents that are potentially

21

applicable.

22

what the application and what manufacturing processes

23

are there for.

24

every patent that we have on every manufacturing process

25

that we own, which is incoherent.

I mean, I think I probably ought to

But

That list is coherent if the sponsor knows

4

sense for us to adjudicate the patents on the molecule

5

and perhaps the purposes of the molecule.

6

think it makes sense to get a court to adjudicate all of

7

them.

8

(l) -- the statute in (l)(7) recognizes that the sponsor

9

may well obtain other patents after the lists are

That has happened in this case.

11

And in the Apotex case that my friend was

available, it is about to happen in that case, too,

14

because the -- the PTO has just allowed claims that read

So, number one, there can be and often

If the applicant was seeking the world and

the FDA is the one who narrowed it, why isn't it fair to

the licensed product holder to let that injunction

3

continue until there's now certainty that there isn't?

4

If the -- if the patent infringement process ended up

saying no infringement, district court agreed and there

is no injunction, so these licensed products is going to

deal with goods in the market, but they've gotten a shot

at this, and the claims are now even more narrow.

we will get to a situation in which there are no patent

disputes left to be resolved once the license issues
