ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE E. STETSON

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MS. STETSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

The exceptionally low Bell v. Hood pleading

13

standard under which a plaintiff's claims will survive

14

dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as

15

long as they are not wholly insubstantial or frivolous

16

has no application in a Foreign Sovereign Immunities

17

Act.

18

power to decide a case, and before a court in the United

19

States may exercise that power over a foreign sovereign,

20

it needs to decide that that sovereign is not entitled

21

to immunity.

22

Title 28.

23

from Section 1330.

24

this Court has explained in Verlinden, which is that a

25

court presented with a Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act

Subject matter jurisdiction bespeaks the court's

"Decide" comes from Section 1602 of

That phrase "not entitled to immunity comes
What that means in practice is what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

claim against a sovereign must decide at this threshold

2

of the litigation, must satisfy itself that jurisdiction

3

exists.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I take it there will be

5

instances, or there could be instances in which the

6

court finds that there is jurisdiction, that there is no

7

immunity, and then as the case develops in the fact

8

finding stages that, you know, I've made a mistake;

9

there's immunity here.

10

MS. STETSON:

That could happen.
It could conceivably happen,

11

Your Honor.

12

reasons.

13

pressed by the sovereign at the beginning, it's

14

considered to be waived.

15

sovereign, for example, doesn't raise a factual

16

challenge --

17

It generally does not happen for a couple

The first is that immunity is -- unless it is

So in circumstances where a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In my -- my hypothetical,

18

it is raised; the judge rules against it, and especially

19

in a case like this where there's, I think, a foreign

20

subsidiary that's incorporated in domestic --

21

domestically in Venezuela, then there might be questions

22

of the extent of overlapping management and so forth.

23

It seems to me that that might -- if there's an initial

24

finding of no immunity, the judge might, in the course

25

of hearing the case on the merits that, you know, really

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

there's immunity here.

2

MS. STETSON:

That's -- that's possible.
It's certainly possible.

I

3

think the more problematic issue is what happened here,

4

though, which is that the D.C. Circuit completed --

5
6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is the opposite,

where they didn't know.

7

MS. STETSON:

That's -- that's precisely

8

right, that the D.C. Circuit here concluded that because

9

there might be not be immunity, what it said was at this

10

stage of the litigation, it was permitting the claims

11

against the sovereign to go forward.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think -- I think what

13

you have described sounds to me like the 12(b)(6)

14

standard, that is have you stated a claim that would

15

entitle you to relief under this statute.

16

extent that I comprehend your position, it's -- there's

17

no counterpart to 12(b)(1).

18

12(b)(1), 12(b)(6) standard.

19

It's the 12(b)(6) standard.

20

MS. STETSON:

So to the

There's no discrete
It's one and the same.

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'm

21

not -- I'm not sure that this case blends those two

22

standards, and that's -- in that way.

23

say.

24

lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the

25

FSIA, what the court is required to do then is to turn

Here's what I'd

With respect to a 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

to what this Court has described as all of those

2

substantive, detailed Federal standards that are

3

essentially baked into the jurisdictional standard

4

itself.

5

a FSIA case, you certainly would bring, and we did

6

bring, that motion under section 12(b)(1).

7

do then is not just to apply this loose Bell v. Hood

8

standard.

9

substantive Federal standards that are included in those

10

So for purposes of establishing jurisdiction in

What you do is you apply the relevant

jurisdictional provisions.

11

Now --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13
14

But what you

And how did -- and how

would that differ from a 12(b)(6) inquiry?
MS. STETSON:

It differs in a number of

15

different respects, most importantly procedurally.

16

respect to a 12(b)(6) inquiry, of course a sovereign who

17

loses a 12(b)(6) challenge wouldn't be entitled to the

18

immediate interlocutory appeal.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

With

I was --

I don't -- I don't quite

21

understand that.

Why would that not be so?

22

immunity is analogous, for example, to absolute -- a

23

category of absolute immunity for a government official

24

or qualified immunity for a government official, those

25

are also immunities from suit; and therefore, under the

Alderson Reporting Company

If this

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

collateral-order doctrine, an adverse ruling could be

2

appealed.

3

MS. STETSON:

True, but -- true, but --

4

inasmuch as immunity is at stake, it -- it could be

5

appealed.

6

than the converse, which is if a right is so important

7

that it is entitled to -- the sovereign is entitled to

8

take an immediate appeal, it should be tested with

9

something other than the Bell v Hood standard.

But in a way, that proves our point rather

10

But more on point --

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, no.

Because you could

12

test -- you could determine jurisdiction under the Bell

13

v. Hood standard, and then you can move to dismiss the

14

complaint under 12(b)(6).

15

you could take appeal under the collateral-order

16

doctrine.

17

without producing some of the unfortunate -- arguably

18

unfortunate collateral consequences of labeling this as

19

jurisdictional, among which is the fact that this Court

20

would have to decide all sorts of questions even if they

21

are not contested by the parties?

22

And if you're unsuccessful,

Why doesn't that serve interest just as well,

MS. STETSON:

So two responses, Your Honor.

23

The first is, with respect to that last point, the

24

questions that the Court has to decide are the questions

25

that the sovereign asks it to decide.

Alderson Reporting Company

It is the

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

sovereign's prerogative in an FSIA case to call either

2

the factual or the legal predicates into question.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what is the basis for

4

that?

They're just -- you may waive immunity, but is

5

there a statutory provision that supports what you just

6

said?

7

MS. STETSON:

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MS. STETSON:

Yes.

Section 1330.

And what does it say?
It says that a court must

10

decide whether the sovereign is not entitled to immunity

11

before jurisdiction can lie.

12

curious things about this --

13
14

And that's one of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wait.

Where does it say

that in the text of the statute?

15

MS. STETSON:

16

Section 1330A, that place.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In the last provision of

Well, the section -- I mean,

18

the question here is -- that seems right.

The question

19

is whether a sovereign is entitled to immunity, and I

20

guess I -- I would ask you to look at the statute, and

21

to try to explain to me your reading of the language in

22

the statute.

23

not be immune... in any case... in which rights in

24

property taken in violation of international law are in

25

issue."

So the statute says "a foreign state shall

Right?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

Now, it seems to me that you are reading

2

this statute as if it said that a foreign state shall

3

not be immune in any case in which rights and property

4

have been taken in violation of international law.

5

other words, you're taking out the "are in issue"

6

language and suggesting that the question at the

7

threshold is -- is -- is whether the rights and

8

property, in fact, have been taken, rather than whether

9

they are in dispute.

10

MS. STETSON:

In

Justice Kagan, I think the --

11

I think the answer has to do with that phrase "are in

12

issue" that you've focused on.

13

issue, it actually has to be a right.

14

explaining to the district court in the D.C. Circuit

15

below, with respect to the parent company who is the

16

plaintiff in this case, that parent company possesses no

17

right.

18

For a right to be in
And as we were

The right is not in issue if your right exists.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what -- what is left

19

to be in issue, if you've already decided that there is

20

a right on property and it has -- and that it has been

21

taken in violation of international law?

22

MS. STETSON:

With respect to a claim

23

against a sovereign under that particular expropriation

24

provision, depending on the nature of the claim, if it's

25

grounded in a common law claim, there could be other

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

defenses that could be raised.

2

this one was, which curiously, just tracks the language

3

of the jurisdictional statute, "a taking in violation of

4

international law," it is conceivable if you test kind

5

of the very end of that hypothetical, that you could

6

imagine a circumstance where the merits get bound up in

7

the jurisdictional inquiry.

8

Respondent's position on that, though, is this Court

9

already explained that that is okay.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if it's grounded as

The problem with the

I think I'm just -- I'm just

11

missing what -- and maybe I'm just missing it.

But

12

this -- it seems it's a funny way of writing this if

13

you're right.

14

have said, well, a foreign State shall not be immune in

15

any case in which there's a right in property taken --

16

that has been taken in violation of international law.

17

What is the "are in issue" language doing,

If you're right, Congress should just

18

except to say that the inquiry is whether there is a

19

dispute about whether there's a violation of

20

international law?

21

MS. STETSON:

So two things.

The first is

22

for there to be a dispute, there has to be a right, and

23

it has to have been taken in violation of international

24

law.

25

you can see this at pages 3 and again at 18 and again at

The problem with the Respondent's reading -- and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

24 of their brief, they insert the word "claim" at

2

issue, which of course, the statute doesn't -- doesn't

3

contain.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would it be -- would it be

5

meaningful to say that when a Bivens action is filed

6

with jurisdiction predicated on the arising under

7

statute, a constitutional right is in issue?

8
9

MS. STETSON:

It would certainly be

reasonable to say that in the abstract, but here's --

10

here's the problem with -- with engaging too much on, I

11

think, "are in issue."

12

must presently be in issue.

13

We've also explained why there has to be a "taken in

14

violation of international law."

15

expropriation, that is a particularly important phrase.

We have explained why the right
There must be a right.

For purposes of

16

The issue with reading Federal

17

jurisdictional statutes, as this Court explained just

18

last term in Manning, is that we're already, for the

19

most part, past the point where we are heeling too

20

closely to the text.

21

and coherence and judicial policy.

22

We look at the dictates of reason

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, this is a curious

23

argument for you to be raising, because your prime --

24

your lead argument is that the text indisputably

25

supports your position, is it not?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1
2

MS. STETSON:
depends on the text.

3
4

Our lead argument certainly

But my point is the text is not --

JUSTICE ALITO:

You just -- you just said we

shouldn't pay that much attention to what the text says.

5

MS. STETSON:

Our text is not our only

6

anchor, is my point.

The anchor is, if you get to the

7

point where we are having this intense discussion about

8

"in issue" -- and this has actually come up before in

9

the Alahi case.

There was a colloquy between the

10

majority and the concurrence, and the concurring Justice

11

said, it must be acknowledged that the words in issue

12

don't lend themselves to an interpretation that might be

13

infallible.

14
15

So what you look at is the context from
which that decision came.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MS. STETSON:

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

When?

Okay.

And --

Under 12(b)(1).
-- that's to determine if

there is jurisdiction?

11

MS. STETSON:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

should be the same here?

14

MS. STETSON:

Correct.
And you're saying that

I'm saying that it should be

15

the same here, both with respect to the claim we're

16

bringing right now, which is to the legal sufficiency of

17

the complaint:

18

Was that Venezuelan subsidiary's company right taken in

19

violation of international law?

20
21
22

Did that parent company have a right?

That sufficiency of the pleading
jurisdictional challenge is quintessentially -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Your response to Justice

23

Breyer suggests that it's not only a question of legal

24

sufficiency -- and I think that the government

25

specifically says this in its brief --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

MS. STETSON:

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.
-- that you would also have

3

a factual -- any factual disputes addressed at that

4

time.

5

there's -- there's a pleading.

6

sufficient, but a defendant can come in and say, well,

7

it might be legally sufficient, but the facts are just

8

wrong.

9

stage too; is that right?

So if there are factual disputes, you know,
It's -- it is legally

And you would have that at the jurisdictional

10

MS. STETSON:

We would indeed.

And in fact,

11

the way that this particular set of circumstances came

12

about, the parties agreed that in order to avoid what

13

might not be necessary, which was jurisdictional

14

discovery, the parties would -- these defendants would

15

front load the legal sufficiency questions before we

16

get to --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

Okay.

So if we take --

So I'm going to ask you --

I'm sorry.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Justice Breyer.

Well, I was thinking, I

22

can't get my hands around this case, or my mind around

23

it, because it -- it seems to me it's really about a

24

practical matter.

25

should the judge in this kind of case decide whether or

pretty good case against them, and maybe a winning case.

11

So decide this thing quickly, decide it up

12

front.

13

these things, I can't really understand as well as, say,

14

Justice Ginsburg, who taught jurisdiction.

15

I -- why are we in this?

16

that practical advice?

17

But to start talking about jurisdiction and

MS. STETSON:

And -- and

Why don't we just give them

I think that the reason that

18

the practical advice might not be enough is -- is

19

another response to a question that Justice Alito posed

20

to me earlier, which is for purposes of the FSIA, there

21

is a significant difference between a court exercising

22

its power over a foreign sovereign, which is the nature

23

of subject matter jurisdiction, and deciding whether it

24

can exercise that power over foreign sovereign.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What if the Court has to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

decide whether it has jurisdiction?

2

MS. STETSON:

It does indeed.

So for

3

purposes of this, that means that the foreign sovereign

4

can present itself to the court and can challenge,

5

whether it's on the sufficiency of the pleadings or on

6

the facts, can challenge the basis for that

7

jurisdiction.

8
9

And yes, there will be circumstances where a
sovereign comes in and makes legal challenges, such as

10

we have made here, and factual challenges such as might

11

be made --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It just seems a little

13

bit like an academic exercise to me for the following

14

reason:

15

correct me if I'm wrong -- that on the legal question,

16

the sufficiency of the complaint, that the district

17

court said, and the court of appeals approved the

18

finding, that there was a sufficient allegations of fact

19

to state a claim.

20

depended on facts; it depended on a legal conclusion.

21

It appears to me -- and you're going to have to

So I don't think that that ruling

MS. STETSON:

Justice Sotomayor, that --

22

that is correct in this respect.

We decided, along with

23

the respondents, that we would back load any factual

24

challenges to jurisdiction.

25

typical factual challenge would be you've attempted to

So for example, the -- a

Alderson Reporting Company

sue me in U.S. court; I don't have a commercial nexus

2

with the U.S.

3

These challenges, though -- and you can see

4

this best in the D.C. Circuit's panel opinion -- these

5

challenges are challenges of law to the sufficiency of

6

the pleadings.

7

What the D.C. Circuit concluded in those

11

circumstances, and what the words it used at Joint

12

Appendix 183 were, "At this stage, those pleadings were

13

passable to get past the jurisdictional standards."

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

What more do

15

you want?

I mean, it seems as if you're asking us for

16

an advisory opinion of what the Court's next step should

17

be with respect to what issues of discovery it should

18

have on other legal issues, not on this one.

19

already ruled that this complaint is sufficient as a

20

matter of law, that this parent, under international

21

law -- I'm not even questioning whether it's right or

wrong.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG

7

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

8

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

I'd like to start by talking about the way

12

that we read the text of this provision, because I think

13

it's a little bit different than the way that

14

Petitioners read it, but not in a way that changes the

15

bottom line in this case.

16
17

So the statute says "Rights and property
taken in violation of international law are an issue."

18

What has to be an issue there are rights and

19

property.

20

Permanent Mission, that means that at the jurisdictional

21

stage, you have to figure out whether the kind of right

22

that's being asserted falls within the federal law

23

definition of rights and property within the FSIA.

24
25

And as we know from this Court's decision in

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you think it's -- it's

taken in violation of international law, and that's also

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

a predicate for what's in issue; is that right?

2

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I don't think that "in

3

issue" actually applies to "taken in violation of

4

international law."

5

international law" is describing and defining the kind

6

of property that you have to be talking about in this

7

case.

8
9

I think that "taken in violation of

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess the question

is, though, what's left to be in issue?

If you're right

10

that the question of whether there is a right in

11

property is decided at the jurisdictional stage, both

12

law and fact, and if you are right that the question of

13

whether that right in property has been taken in

14

violation of international law is also decided, both law

15

and fact, at the jurisdictional stage, then what is the

16

issue, the in issue, that's left for the merits?

17

MS. GOLDENBERG:

So I disagree with part of

18

what you said.

I do think that the question of whether

19

property was taken in violation of international law is

20

something has to be decided at the jurisdictional stage

21

in law, where there's a challenge like there is here, or

22

in fact, if there's a factual challenge.

23

respect to rights and property, those can be an issue.

24

So I don't think you need to decide at the

25

jurisdictional stage whether or not the plaintiff

Alderson Reporting Company

But with

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

actually possesses the right that they claim.

2

So, for instance, if you had a plaintiff who

3

came in and said, I have a deed to this property and it

4

was taken away from me, and the foreign State wanted to

5

come back and say, no, you don't, this deed is a

6

forgery, you never had any relationship to this property

7

at all, that would be in issue and that would be

8

something that could be decided at the merits.

9

The rights and property question that has to

10

be decided at the jurisdictional stage is the one that

11

this Court decided in Permanent Mission, which is, is

12

this right that's being asserted here something that

13

falls within the definition of rights and property that

14

the FSIA put forward?

15

question was:

16

property, even though it's not a right to possession of

17

the property or to ownership of the property --

18

And so in Permanent Mission, the

Is this asserted-lien right a right in

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I'm not

understanding the distinction.

20

case, what would be the first question that would be the

21

threshold question as to a right in property, and what

22

would be the question that would get diverted to the

23

merit stage?

24
25

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Could you -- in this

In this case, I think the

question mainly is the question about whether what's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

being asserted is a right in property.

2

question of whether a shareholder's rights in the

3

company that they own shares in are something that are

4

rights in the property of that subsidiary company, the

5

company that the shareholder has some corporate

6

ownership interest in.

7

that could be answered at the jurisdictional stage.

8

here, we don't know the answer to that question, because

9

all the --

And that is a legal question

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

would be answered at the merit stage?

12

Here, it's a

And

And what's the question that

MS. GOLDENBERG:

The question that would be

13

answered at the merit stage here, I don't think there

14

actually would be much dispute on the merits.

15

instance, in a case like this, you could have a dispute

16

about whether the plaintiff was actually a shareholder

17

or was not a shareholder.

18

before, which I think would be the more common

19

situation, whether the person actually had a deed to

20

that property, or whether they didn't have a deed.

But this is what's really

bothering me:

It sounds, the more I hear you speak,

that there isn't a good thing that we're going to write

in this case that isn't going to get everybody good and

Somebody's from Guam or

And then there's the third kind of case:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

Are you so far out that it isn't even hopeful that you

2

could get into the court on this?

3

Now, if you take the third, which is where

4

we are, you leave it up to the district judge to decide

5

the other two when and if it's most suitable in the

6

case.

If you don't, I'm worried.

7

MS. GOLDENBERG:

But in that circumstance,

8

you are asserting jurisdiction over a foreign State

9

based on a nonfrivolous allegation, and that is

10

something that doesn't respect the foreign State's

11

dignity --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because you are, in fact,

13

asserting jurisdiction over somebody who's from Guam.

14

Because, in fact, you'd have to go into the birth

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But how often -- how

23

often is that a serious concern?

I mean, I understand

24

that the reason you're concerned is that you don't want

But why is that?

Why is that such a significant issue?

12

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, as I said, there is

13

something that is a real affront to a foreign sovereign,

14

or can be an affront to a foreign sovereign if another

court sits in judgment of something that foreign

sovereign has done.

it's only under 12(b)(1), not 12(b)(6).

2

MS. GOLDENBERG:

It does make a difference.

3

And I think it's particularly sensitive with respect to

critical threshold issue that has to be decided at the

21

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you just finish?

Expropriation is different because?
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Expropriation is different

24

because this is a public act of a foreign sovereign

25

taken in its own territory with respect to property in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28

its own territory.

And that is something that, in the

2

normal course, is going to be a matter for the courts in

3

that territory to resolve.

4

The very thing that makes it appropriate for

5

the courts of another country to sit in judgment on that

6

kind of act is that there has been a violation of

7

international law.

8

requirements in the expropriation exception, and those

9

show that the property has some connection to the United

And then you look at the nexus

10

States, which makes it appropriate for United States

11

courts to sit in judgment.

12

And there actually have been real problems,

13

real sensitivities, real foreign relations concerns that

14

have been raised in this area, stemming from the D.C.

15

Circuit's 2008 decision in the Chabad case, which is

16

where the D.C. Circuit first announced the rule that

in violation of international law.

21

That's an expropriation case

The D.C. Circuit decided there was a

At that point, Russia, feeling that it was

immune and it hadn't gotten a full determination of its

immunity, dropped out of the case, and the district

MS. CARROLL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Thank you, Counsel.

The jurisdictional test under the
expropriation exception turns on what is, quote, "in

12

In other words, what is the dispute

That language contrasts starkly with

13

language that Congress used in an analogous provision of

14

the FSIA Section 1610(a)(3).

15

goes to your earlier discussion regarding the meaning of

16

"in issue."

And, Justice Kagan, this

Section 1610(a)(3), which is reprinted at

cases.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Immunity issues generally

MS. CARROLL:

of the court turns on the immunity standard.

The difference here is that

other kinds of jurisdictional provisions don't require

the plaintiff has asserted a particular type of claim.

We think the language --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They simply require that

In other words, you're

Yes.

That's

a reference earlier that our -- our position suggests

that a court has to decide whether there might or might

that's not the position we've asserted.

We don't think that's correct, and

The Court certainly does, must, assure

4

itself at the outset that an exception applies.

5

question is, what is the standard that defines --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

The

And the

7

other -- the other statutes you're talking about and the

8

ones set forth in your red brief just seem to me to

9

avoid the question, which is whether there's a different

10

approach in the foreign sovereign immunity.

11

Our ambassadors have to go to these other

12

countries and say -- or their ambassadors, you're being

sued.

14

you're a sovereign.

in that context.

You have to come into our courts, even though
And we don't want you dragging us

MS. CARROLL:

That's a very low standard

Mr. Chief Justice, the

20

Petitioners and the government have cited no other

22

are proposing applies.

the applicable standard.

Dollar in their reply brief.

To the contrary, as we noted in

MS. CARROLL:

Where the court held

that Bell v. Hood was the applicable standard.

question is why in this one particular area alone would

Congress have written a standard that departs from how

jurisdictional inquiries are determined in every other

context including --

view, if, as is the case here, the defendants are

claim, for example, a defense under the act of State

it has decided whether there's been a taking in

Well, from the -- from the

18

perspective of protecting the dignity and comity of the

19

foreign sovereign that has taken U.S.-owned property in

20

violation of international law, to say that the first

21

decision a court must make is to label the defendant, if

22

the claim holds up, a -- a violator of international law

23

before it can consider any other defenses that might not

require that determination I think is not consonant with

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Carroll, I -- though I

3

have a good deal of sympathy with the way you read the

4

language, but it does seem to me it gets you into one

5

big problem.

6

So, you know, take a case where there is an

7

arguable claim that there's been a violation of

8

international law, so you would satisfy the Bell v. Hood

9

standard, but then the actual claim that's being made is

10

just a straight conversion claim.

11

gotten to the merits, but in the merits stage all you're

12

talking about is this conversion claim.

13

could be adjudicated guilty even though nobody has

14

decided, in fact, whether you violated international

15

law.

16

So you've -- you've

And so you

And that seems as though it cannot be right.
MS. CARROLL:

Well, I -- I think it probably

17

can't be right, but the reason that it's not right has

18

nothing to do with whether Bell applies.

19

Under our view of this statute, Congress and

20

the executive were reacting to a very specific set of

21

problems, and they adopted a very specific solution.

22

They were looking at the Cuban expropriations and other

23

notorious expropriations of property that were affecting

24

U.S. interests where sovereigns were using those

25

expropriations to gain an unfair advantage in the

Alderson Reporting Company

commercial marketplace.

2

said, we want the courthouse doors to be open to those

3

kinds of claims; a claim of a taking in violation of

4

international law, or a tort claim, the gravamen of

5

which is an assertion that the defendant violated

6

international law or the defendant's title is no good

7

because the property was taken in violation of

8

international law.

And they wrote a statute that

All those are within the scope.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MS. CARROLL:

Do you -- sorry, I'm sorry.
Sorry.

brought under this statute.

14

exception.

15
16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This is not the tort

I see.

So you think that's

necessarily a merits issue.

17

MS. CARROLL:

We do.

Whereas I -- I

18

understand the Petitioner's and the government's

19

position to be that this is simply a jurisdictional

20

fact.

21

property was taken at some point by someone from someone

22

in violation of international law, that opens the door

23

to any kind of claim at all so long as it somehow

24

implicates --

25

So long as the plaintiff can show that this

different issue, I think.

Suppose in a diversity case,

2

A says, I'm from Kentucky.

And B says -- and he says B

3

is from Illinois.

4

Kentucky.

5

B files an answer:

No diversity.
Doesn't the judge normally make that

6

determination right then and there?

7

MS. CARROLL:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

No, I'm from

Yes, with respect -Well, then why should it be

any different here?

10

MS. CARROLL:

Because this is not a

11

jurisdictional fact like the citizenship of the parties.

12

It's a --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, so what?

I mean, the

14

reason you do make that right at the beginning, I have

15

always thought, was not a mystical thing.

16

you don't want to haul somebody across the country in

17

different places when there isn't even diversity

18

jurisdiction.

19

It's because

Here, though, the reasoning isn't quite the

20

same.

They say, try it out at the beginning whether

21

there is at least a claim here, real claim, that they

22

did seize the violation -- they did seize the property,

23

violation of international law.

So do it at the beginning, Judge,

2

don't wait till the end of the case.

MS. CARROLL:

I don't know.

What difference does it make whether you
move under 12(b)(6) or move under 12(b)(1)?
MS. CARROLL:

I think probably the only

14

significant difference it makes is the difference that

15

Justice Alito referred to earlier, which is the

16

implications of taking merits issues and calling them

17

jurisdictional, and those implications are at least

18

among the following:

19

Number one, the arguments can't be weighed.

20

Ms. Stetson is relying on a -- a version of the waiver

21

doctrine that although we as plaintiffs in an FSIA case

22

might be happy with, is not how courts have applied it

23

and not how they've asserted it below.

24

is asserting its immunity, then the court cannot find

25

that immunity has been waived.

If the sovereign

It must find

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do we have to -- can we say

3

that -- can we just say -- can we say, look, I guess we

4

couldn't, but -- but I don't care whether it's 12(b)(1)

5

or 12(b)(6).

6

is try out right at the beginning of the case if it's at

7

all possible whether you have a basis here, the

8

plaintiff, for getting this foreign country into our

9

courts.

10

Judge, what you ought to do in such a case

MS. CARROLL:

But the consequence of calling

11

it 12(b)(1) is that it is treated as a subject matter

12

jurisdiction question.

13

appeals over every new statutory theory -- even if we're

14

just looking at legal sufficiency, defendants can

15

serially raise new statutory arguments that then go up

16

and down.

18
19

That means serial interlocutory

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's go back to Justice

Alito's question.
Why I'm confused by this case is I think

20

both the State Department and your adversary are upset

21

that the court found that there was a viable legal

22

argument that a parent could have property interests in

23

the -- in the possessions of a subsidiary.

24

Is that your understanding?

25

MS. CARROLL:

With respect, I -- well, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42

don't have an understanding about the motivations of why

2

they are upset.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MS. CARROLL:

I agree.

But with respect -- with

5

respect to what the dispute is in the case, what their

6

legal challenge is to the parent's claim, is not about

7

the character of the rights as rights in property.

8

arguments that were made and decided below were the

9

following:

The

The defendants contended that the only

10

property that was taken was property belonging to the

11

subsidiary.

12

those rights.

13

example, they own shares in the subsidiary.

14

position was not that those rights are not property

15

rights, but that those rights were not taken.

16

The parent doesn't have standing to assert
The parent does have its own rights, for
Their

So there was no dispute about whether those

17

rights at issue are quote/unquote property rights.

18

dispute is do these two plaintiffs, can they proceed to

19

bring a claim of a violation of international law as a

20

result of the uncompensated, discriminatory taking of

21

their property.

22

Court has made clear that in jurisdictional statutes

23

that turn on the nature of the claim, rather than a

factual showing, Bell v. Hood is the governing standard

across those contexts, even when sovereign immunity --

MS. CARROLL:

Our argument on that issue is

17

that the Venezuelan incorporation of the subsidiary does

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

difficult for one party to tell the other party it

you're saying.

I'm -- I'm sure that they

don't.

I'm tempted to say a lot of things in response

9

to that, but I think the -- the most straightforward

10

response is that the Bell v. Hood standard is the one

11

that, I think, is best addressed to that concern,

12

because rather than requiring the full-up adjudication

13

of this defendant's status as a violator of

international law, it simply applies the same

jurisdictional determinations that apply in suits in the

arguments, specifically, they would make.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If they were

It's the one that they

proposed to the district court, which was whether

international law on the issue of Venezuela's

expropriation of H&P-V's property.

19

MS. CARROLL:

So that argument was framed as

20

a legal argument.

I don't know that it would require

any discovery at all.

22

and proceeding to 12(b)(6), I -- I think, you know,

A court under this position -- under their

And I want to address the Permanent Mission

case which Ms. Goldenberg averted to where she, I think,

13

correctly acknowledged that the only issue in that case

14

was the character of the rights in issue as

15

quote/unquote property.

16

There was no issue in that case about

17

whether the plaintiff's claim had any merit to it.

defendants in that case had argued, among other things,

that they weren't obligated to pay the tax.

11

there's a dispute about the commercial nexus, that's

13

MS. CARROLL:

12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6)?
We believe that has to be

14

decided at 12(b)(1) because it is a factual requirement

15

just as, for example, a waiver requirement.

16

not unusual to have a jurisdiction provision that

17

combines both of those types of elements.

18

But it's

The diversity statute is one, you know,

19

where the citizenship of the parties has to be

established.

about it, the Court must decide at 12(b)(1).

it's -- there's a commercial nexus, you say, well,

requirement and the kind of requirement that simply goes

3

to what -- what have you put in issue?

4

about?

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What's the case

Well, what if

6

there's a dispute about the shareholder status of the

7

rights and property issue?

8

property, but we think you own only 49 percent of the

9

shares.

There may be rights and

And the plaintiffs say, no, no, they -- they

10

own 51 percent, so they have a right in property.

11

That's a factual dispute that is decided where?

12

MS. CARROLL:

That is a factual dispute that

13

was -- would be part of the merit.

14

argument was because of the amount of shares you own,

15

which of course is not an issue here because the parent

16

is the sole shareholder --

17
18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If the point of the

No, no, I know.

It's a hypothetical.
MS. CARROLL:

But if the argument is because

20

of the amount of shares you own, you don't own enough to

21

be able to succeed and be entitled to relief on the

22

claim that you've alleged, that's a merits

23

determination.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's -- well,

or it's a jurisdictional determination because you only

Official - Subject to Final Review

55
1

have jurisdiction if you have rights and property, and

2

you'd only have rights and property if you own 51

3

percent instead of 49 percent.

4

somebody coming in and saying, I'm not a citizen of

5

Kentucky?

6

MS. CARROLL:

Why isn't that like

Because the statute doesn't

7

say you must show you have rights and property.

8

that you must show that rights and property are an issue

9

in the suit.

What's the suit about?

It says

It's about an

10

assertion by the plaintiff that their rights and

11

property were taken in violation of -- of international

12

law.

13

The -- the argument that Petitioners has

14

made -- are making now is not a new one.

15

argument that was made to this Court in the Binderup

16

case under the Sherman Act in the 1920s.

17

argument that was made to this Court in Bell v. Hood in

18

the 1940s.

19

that's been made in the whole Steel Co. line of cases.

20

And consistently, the Court has recognized that

21

jurisdiction is vital before a court can decide that

22

type of issue.

23

It's an

It's an

It's the same argument, Justice Ginsburg,

JUSTICE BREYER:

So in your view, on the

24

Chief Justice's hypothetical, before -- your view is

25

they move under 12(b)(6) right away and they would say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

56
1

you aren't entitled to relief because you only own

2

49 percent?

3
4

MS. CARROLL:

Right.

And nothing would have

stopped them from doing that.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, except that a

6

lot of district judges don't like moving under 12(b)(6)

7

right away.

8

before they -- before they decide whether there's a

9

claim or not.

10

They like to have further development

MS. CARROLL:

I'm -- I can't say that that's

11

been an -- an issue in this case where there's been fair

12

amount of agreement among the parties and the courts as

13

to what order the issue should be decided in.

14

The -- the petitioners here have asserted a

15

challenge, a factual challenge to jurisdiction under the

16

commercial nexus requirements.

17

PDVSA is named as the expropriating entity in the

18

decree, and even though PDVSA initiated the eminent

19

domain proceedings, nonetheless, we assert as a factual

20

matter that actually we've shifted ownership and control

21

of the property to some other PDVSA entity, and that

22

entity doesn't engage in commercial activity in the

23

United States, and so, therefore, there's no

24

jurisdiction.

25

They said even though

And as a matter of fairness, of course we're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

entitled to examine the -- the factual basis of that

2

assertion.

3

so far in the case, and it happened because the

4

Petitioners chose to make that factual argument.

5

didn't have to.

6

have a great legal argument on the merits, and so we're

7

going to move under 12(b)(6) to dismiss the action for

8

failure to state a claim.

9

That's the only discovery that has gone on

They

They could have just said, we think we

They have never brought that claim.

To this

10

day, there is no pending motion to dismiss for any of

11

the grounds that -- that they have asserted for failure

12

to state a claim, only under 12(b)(1).

13

the Rule 12(b) -- the office of Rule 12(b)(1) is very

14

different from the office of Rule 12(b)(6).

15

implicates all of the concerns of shoving merits issues

16

into the determination, and for that reason, we think

17

there's no reason to construe this language to have that

18

consequence.

And of course,

12(b)(1)

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE E. STETSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. STETSON:

Ms. Carroll describes this

case as a subject matter jurisdiction case like any

that the FSIA is sui generis.

3

jurisdiction isn't just about jurisdiction over a class

of cases or a type of case.

That is the

6

difference between 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).

12(b)(6)

requires that court to have taken jurisdiction, to have

exercised its power over that sovereign.

In answer, Justice Breyer, to your order --

14

needs to give is the one that it already gave, frankly,

15

in Verlinden, which is courts apply the substantive

16

detailed FSIA standards to determine jurisdiction, not

17

just to hypothesize it.

This is -- the only order that this Court
