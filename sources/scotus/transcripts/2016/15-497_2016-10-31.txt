Mr. Bagenstos.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Congress adopted the Handicapped Children's

12

Protection Act to make clear that the IDEA is not the

13

exclusive vehicle for protecting the rights of children

14

with disabilities, and Congress also sought to make

15

clear that cases brought under other Federal statutes,

16

like the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, may proceed

17

directly to court so long as they are not actually

18

seeking relief that is also available under the IDEA.

19

Under that statutory text, it is irrelevant

20

whether the plaintiff could have sought some other form

21

of relief that would have been available under the IDEA.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose -- suppose that

23

there is a school district and two surrounding school

24

districts within the same Federal court jurisdiction and

25

same circuit.

Have each been ordered to make

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

accommodations under FAPE -- under FAPE for a dog?

2

then the person in the third school district just sues

3

under the ADA.

4

Is there an exhaustion problem?

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, I think the question

5

would be:

6

seeking in that third lawsuit?

What is the relief that the plaintiff is

7
8

And

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it just depends on what

the complaint says?

9

MR. BAGENSTOS:

I think it depends on the

10

relief the Plaintiff is seeking, because that's what the

11

statutory language says.

12

So the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then you're saying

13

that the artful form of the complaint suffices to

14

subject the district court to damages that it might

15

not -- the school district to damages that it might not

16

otherwise have had to pay.

17

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, a couple of points

18

about that.

First, I don't think it's the artful form

19

of the complaint; I think it is the relief the Plaintiff

20

is seeking.

21

being sought under a separate Federal statute that would

22

fully apply even if exhaustion existed.

23

isn't whether the school district is going to be

24

subjected to damages under the ADA or not.

25

something that might exist anyway.

But, secondly, remember, this is damages

Alderson Reporting Company

The question

That is

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

The question is whether IDEA proceedings

2

have to first be exhausted and what Congress said about

3

that in this statute, unlike in other Federal statutes

4

where it said exhaustion is required whenever any remedy

5

is available.

6

Here, what Congress said is when the

7

plaintiff is seeking relief that is also available under

8

the IDEA --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you could -- you

10

could have -- you could have, as Justice Kennedy

11

suggested, gone the IDEA route.

12

accommodate the dog, and -- and if you had done that,

13

and you were turned down, could you then switch to the

14

ADA track, or would you have to, having started under

15

IDEA, continue on that route?

16

MR. BAGENSTOS:

You could have asked to

Well, under Respondent's

17

position here, I think we would have -- and under the

18

Sixth Circuit's position certainly, we would have to

19

follow all of the IDEA procedures through to their

20

conclusion before filing a lawsuit under the ADA.

21

I don't think -- I think we still would be able to file

22

the ADA lawsuit.

I --

23

Now, the -- there's a difference not just in

24

terms of relief in the lawsuit that would be filed under

25

the ADA versus the one that would be filed under the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

IDEA, which is, under the IDEA, in order to get any

2

relief, the plaintiff would have to show not just that

3

there is a denial of a dog, but that that actually

4

deprived the plaintiff of a free appropriate public

5

education.

6

Under the ADA, the -- the rights that

7

individuals with disabilities have to bring their

8

service dogs to public facilities are the same in all

9

public facilities.

10
11

You have a service dog; you can

bring it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I understand

12

you'd be making two arguments.

One is that you don't

13

have to exhaust because you're asking for damages, and

14

those aren't available under the IDEA.

15

MR. BAGENSTOS:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
And the second one

17

is, you don't have to exhaust because you're not

18

complaining about the fair and appropriate public

19

education provision.

20

you have to satisfy both of them?

21

Are those separate arguments or do

MR. BAGENSTOS:

No.

I think they're

22

independent arguments, Mr. Chief Justice, so I think the

23

fact that we are seeking emotional distress damages, and

24

those damages, as the Sixth Circuit recognized, are not

25

available under the IDEA, is fully sufficient for us to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1
2

prevail here to say that exhaustion was not required.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if that's the

3

case, why -- I would suspect that the denial of what is

4

sought under the IDEA for a fair and appropriate public

5

education is something that could well cause emotional

6

distress in -- in most cases.

7

saying is that you have to tack on to an IDEA claim, the

8

claim for damages for emotional distress and then you

9

don't have to exhaust, and so whenever a school district

10

denies an element of an FAPE or a proposed element, they

11

will always face two-track litigation?

12

MR. BAGENSTOS:

And so is all you're

I don't think that that's

13

right, Your Honor, because -- because it's not the case

14

that every time there is a denial of a free appropriate

15

public education under the IDEA there is also going to

16

be a violation of the ADA.

17

overlapping --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. BAGENSTOS:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right, these -- these are

That's true, but -Yes.
-- you could find -- I

21

mean, in -- I have exactly the same question, in a very

22

large number of suits, you know, in a very large number

23

of suits brought -- or controversies -- where a child is

24

seeking a special plan, there is a statute that gives

25

him that right, and it rests -- rests heavily on his

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

getting together or his parents getting together with

2

the school board and trying to work something out that

3

makes sense.

4

Now, it seems to me, as the Chief Justice

5

just said, that if we accept your first argument, not in

6

all cases, but in many cases, where their lawyer wishes

7

to avoid this exhaustion requirement, all he would have

8

to do is wait and then sue, not for putting the child in

9

a private school but rather for emotional suffering.

10

Now, if that argument -- if what I have just

11

said is right, which I think is what was just said by

12

the Chief Justice, that would seem to gut the carefully

13

written procedural system that the IDEA sets up.

14

that's what is concerning me, and I don't think the word

15

"relief" has to be read in the technical way in which

16

you're reading it.

17

MR. BAGENSTOS:

And

Well, so -- so I think this

18

goes not just to what the word "relief" actually says.

19

I think, you know, this is a highly carefully crafted

20

procedural regime as Your Honor says, Justice Breyer.

21

But part of the careful crafting of the

22

regime is the Handicapped Children's Protection Act

23

which, remember, overruled a decision of this Court or

24

overturned a decision of this Court that had sought to

25

channel all disability education claims into IDEA

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

proceedings.

2

What Congress said in the HCPA was there are

3

other statutes that may provide independent remedies

4

under -- at that point it was the Rehabilitation Act

5

Section 1983.

6

list, and those cases may be pursued independently, said

7

Congress, so long as the plaintiffs are not actually

8

seeking anything they can get in IDEA proceedings.

9

Congress later added the ADA to that

JUSTICE BREYER:

The answer to me, and I

10

think to the Chief, so far is, so what?

11

what Congress wanted.

12

that?

13

Because that's

Is there any answer other than

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, so I -- I mean, I

14

think there are a couple of answers other than that.

15

do think -- I do think it's what Congress wanted, and I

16

think if you look at both the text and the legislative

17

history, Senator Weicker's brief goes through this,

18

shows that it's what Congress wanted.

19

I

But, in addition to that, yes, I think

20

there -- there is -- there's a lot of reason to believe,

21

and we have an amicus brief here from former special

22

education administrators Thomas Hehir, Melody Musgrove,

23

and -- and -- and Madeline Will, who specifically say,

24

look, we think that what parents are going to do based

25

on our experience is go through IDEA procedures, because

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

what they want is to get the relief that's available in

2

IDEA proceedings.

3

There are some cases, like this case, like

4

the Fry case -- or I'm sorry -- like the Payne case in

5

the Ninth Circuit, where you have a case of abuse, where

6

the principal injuries are not injuries to education,

7

they are emotional injuries.

8

are going to proceed to court.

9

Those are the cases that
So I think it's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess that's

10

why -- but even if what you say is right, and it makes a

11

lot of sense, a lawyer advising a client might advise

12

that, look, this is what you want the school to do so

13

that you can have a free and appropriate education for

14

your child.

15

the school to do that if you also sue them under the ADA

16

and Section 504, and the school board is sitting there

17

looking at it and say, gosh, we are not only exposed to

18

what relief is under the IDEA, but we are going to have

19

to pay damages.

You will have a lot more leverage getting

You understand my point?

20

MR. BAGENSTOS:

I do.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

As a practical

22

matter, it would be -- could well be in the child's and

23

parents' interest to proceed along two tracks because it

24

makes it much more likely, even if what all they really

25

want, they don't care about the money.

Alderson Reporting Company

They really care

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

about education for their child.

2

MR. BAGENSTOS:

But I think the point about

3

that -- I think that is right about a lot of practical

4

issues here.

5

does not change the leverage that the plaintiffs have

6

here, right?

7

the plaintiffs, our clients, could have exhausted IDEA

8

proceedings, said at the time we filed an IDEA

9

administrative complaint, by the way, school district,

The crucial point there is that exhaustion

So even under the Sixth Circuit's rule,

10

we are also going to sue you under the ADA and

11

Rehabilitation Act for damages.

12
13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
are done with this.

14
15

Later on, once we

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Once we are done with this.

And --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think one of the

17

important things in this type of proceeding is timing,

18

right?

19

all this takes time.

20

this ends, you know, who knows, I mean, it gathers a

21

debate about how quickly these things are resolved, then

22

we might bring this.

23

that gives you the leverage when you need it to get the

24

accomodation in place that you want for the child.

25

I mean, we are talking about a school year, and
So the idea that well, when all

But if you do it at the same time,

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, Your Honor, I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

there are obviously a lot of variables.

I think a lot

2

of defense lawyers would certainly say being threatened

3

with long, drawn-out proceedings at the end of which is

4

a damages award is pretty significant leverage as well.

5

And I think the point is that time also works both ways

6

here, right?

7

to do in the HCPA was recognize that the ADA and

8

Rehabilitation Act in 1983 are independent, and

9

requiring parents to first proceed through what are

One of the things that Congress was trying

10

likely to be time-consuming proceedings under a separate

11

statute, the IDEA, that can't give them the relief that

12

they are seeking under those independent statutes.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But your whole point again

14

is it depends on what's in the complaint.

15

statute says that before a filing of a civil action, you

16

have to exhaust.

17

it would have said at the time you filed a complaint,

18

the complaint must ask "only for."

19

saying, but that's not what the statute says.

20

And the

If the statute were written your way,

MR. BAGENSTOS:

That's what you're

So -- so I'd say a couple of

21

things about that, Your Honor.

I mean, first of all, I

22

think seeking relief might naturally be read to look at

23

what's in the complaint.

24

think our argument turns on what we asked for in the

25

complaint, particularly.

But in any event, I don't

We have made clear throughout

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

these proceedings, not just in the complaint but as the

2

proceedings have gone on, that what we are asking for is

3

compensatory damages for emotional distress.

4
5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could -- could I ask about

that, Mr. Bagenstos?

6

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And this takes you back to

8

the first part of the Chief Justice's question, just so

9

I can understand the argument, is you're really making

10

two arguments.

11

One argument is initially when we filed the

12

complaint and ever since, we've really only sought

13

emotional distress damages, and emotional distress

14

damages are something that can't be given under the

15

IDEA.

16

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that's one argument.

18

But there is a second argument which says,

19

you know, putting that aside, the reason why we don't

20

need to exhaust is because we are not alleging that

21

we've been denied a fair and appropriate public

22

education.

23

or -- or deprivation, but we are not alleging that.

24

agree that the school has given us a free appropriate

25

public education.

You know, we are alleging some other denial
We

And that, in itself, as I understand

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

it, would also mean that you don't have to exhaust,

2

right?

3
4

So it can be one or the other.
you're saying.

5
6

Is that what

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Yes.

So -- yes.

So I

tried -- I -- to say -- yeah.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, this -- this case is

8

actually the combination of the two, is what you're

9

saying.

So in some ways, you're saying this is the

10

easiest case where both are true.

11

alleging the denial of a FAPE, nor are you seeking the

12

kinds of damages that an IDEA officer could provide.

13

it's the intersection of the two theories.

14

if I understand your argument, either one of those

15

things would mean that you don't have to exhaust.

16

that right?

17

MR. BAGENSTOS:

So

But -- but

Is

I agree with that, Justice

18

Kagan.

19

theory we wouldn't have to exhaust, and because --

20

because this is a case where both what we are seeking is

21

something that categorically is unavailable in IDEA

22

proceedings.

23

Yes.

You're neither

I think this -- I think under either

And -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And what --

24

Mr. Bagenstos, could you clarify what you are giving up

25

by taking this route, by suing under the ADA and not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

under the IDEA?

2

MR. BAGENSTOS:

So -- so what -- what we are

3

giving up and what parents are giving up generally by

4

pursuing this route is anything you can get under the

5

IDEA.

6

That is compensatory education.

7

IEP.

So that is reimbursement of educational expenses.

8
9
10
11

That is changing an

Now, we are seeking none of that.
seeking none of that in this lawsuit.

We are

What we are

seeking -JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you might be.

I mean,

12

and this goes to -- I mean, suppose -- suppose that you

13

weren't alleging a denial of a FAPE, but you were

14

seeking damages that included, you know, I sent my kid

15

to private school.

16

you could get from an IDEA officer, but for some reason

17

that didn't have to do with the denial of a FAPE.

18

You're saying that you don't have to exhaust in that

19

context either.

20

I had to hire a tutor.

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Right.

Damages that

And so -- so that is

21

the second argument, and I agree that the Court does not

22

have to reach that argument in order to rule in our

23

favor here, but yes.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if we did, I

mean, it seems to me that that might address many of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

concerns that have been raised about the impact of the

2

two-track proceeding.

3

your argument were to be that no, you need both, it

4

seems to me that would address a lot of the practical

5

problems.

6

this case, both are present --

In other words, if, in fact -- if

Now, I appreciate the fact that you think, in

7

MR. BAGENSTOS:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10
11

Right.
-- but yet you want

to make a more aggressive argument that you only need
one.
MR. BAGENSTOS:

Right.

And I think we -- I

12

think we would certainly prevail under the "you need

13

both" theory, and that's why we alleged and we have

14

argued throughout this case --

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I suppose one

16

understanding of this is we don't have to really deal

17

with what happens if you only have one, because you're

18

saying you have both.

19

Is that right?

MR. BAGENSTOS:

That is entirely right.

20

So -- so let's be clear about the second point here.

So

21

the defendants have said all along that because they

22

gave my client a one-on-one aid, that all of her

23

physical and educational needs were satisfied.

24

have not challenged that, and it would be difficult for

25

us to challenge that.

And we

I know this Court has a different

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

free appropriate public education in front of it later

2

this term that may clarify what FAPE means, but under

3

current Sixth Circuit law it would be difficult for us

4

to challenge it.

5

client experienced is not a denial of education, but,

6

for example, the humiliation that she experienced when

7

she was forced to go to the toilet with the stall door

8

open and four adults watching her because defendants did

9

not trust her to use her dog to transfer to the toilet

10

bowl.

11

claim, Your Honor.

What we have said is the injury my

That is not a free appropriate public education

12

And, Mr. Chief Justice --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that claim could be

14

made by someone who doesn't qualify, who is disabled but

15

doesn't qualify for ADA because she doesn't have any

16

learning disability.

17

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Absolutely.

A person that

18

has a disability that does not require special education

19

so is not covered by the IDEA would still be covered by

20

the ADA and be able to make exactly the same claim in a

21

school here, yes.

22

That's right, Justice Ginsburg.

JUSTICE ALITO:

What would happen if the

23

claim was that the child suffered emotional damages

24

because of the denial of educational benefits?

25

MR. BAGENSTOS:

So -- so I think that would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

be a harder case because that would present only the

2

first -- the first of our two theories, that would be we

3

would be seeking damages that are not available under

4

the IDEA.

5

that is also available, not alleges in injury that might

6

be addressed in IDEA proceedings.

7

text, I think exhaustion wouldn't be required, but our

8

case is stronger because we have both here.

9

And remember, the statute says seeking relief

Now, under that plain

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ

14

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

15

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

16
17

MR. MARTINEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

18

The parties, both parties, and the

19

government now all agree that the rule under which the

20

Sixth Circuit decided this case is wrong, and that

21

exhaustion is required only if the relief that the

22

plaintiff actually seeks in the case is available under

23

the IDEA.

24

sensible way to resolve the case is simply to reverse

25

the decision below and let the claims go forward.

In light of that agreement, we think the most

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

As the Sixth Circuit pointed out, the relief

2

actually sought in this case is money damages, not a

3

change to the IEP, and that relief is not available

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Martinez, that begs

6

the last question that was asked, which is the Payne --

7

you know the Ninth Circuit Payne decision.

8

MR. MARTINEZ:

Sure.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It doesn't do just that.

10

It doesn't just look just at the relief.

11

the nature of the claims and decides whether they are a

12

fact claim or not, whether it is seeking a change in a

13

FAPE or not, in essence in substance.

14

looking at it technically as we are asking for relief.

15

But it's -- it's looking at whether or not a FAPE claim

16

is the substance of the allegation.

17

with the Ninth Circuit approach, presumably.

18

MR. MARTINEZ:

It looks at

So it's not

You're disagreeing

Justice Sotomayor, I just

19

want to be clear, I -- we understand the Ninth Circuit's

20

approach.

21

explained this in our -- our brief at the petition

22

stage, to be departing from the other circuits, and

23

actually saying that what matters is what the plaintiff

24

actually asks for.

25

We understand the Ninth Circuit, and we

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

Alderson Reporting Company

What they -- what

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

they are saying is, is the nature of the relief that

2

they are asking for, would it require or necessitate a

3

change in the fact?

4

they look at.

5
6

That's one of the three prongs that

MR. MARTINEZ:

Are you talking about the

third prong in --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MR. MARTINEZ:

9

third prong, Your Honor.

Yes, exactly.

We do disagree with that
But I think that third prong

10

is addressed to circumstances in which the -- the

11

elements of the non-IDEA claim that's being brought

12

overlap entirely with the -- the provision of FAPE.

13

just --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So let's go to the last

15

argument -- the last question directly, then.

16

says the FAPE was all wrong; it's hurt my child.

17

that's the nature of the complaint.

4

MR. MARTINEZ:

Yes.

It's just, I

We think that if you're

seeking injunctive relief in a circumstance in which you

6

think that the FAPE --

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
relief?

How about no injunctive

9

Past and future damages for emotional distress?
MR. MARTINEZ:

I -- I think if there's -- if

10

the only relief sought in the complaint -- and that's

11

what the statute says you look for is money damages --

12

we think that the text of the statute says that you have

13

to figure out whether that relief sought is available

14

under the IDEA.

15

that that relief sought is not available under the IDEA,

16

so you would not need to exhaust.

And I think there's common agreement

17

Now I want to address --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's -- if it's that

19

simple, if it's that simple, why are we in this

20

argument?

21

Under ordinary exhaustion principles, you never have to

22

exhaust and exhaustion would be futile.

23

say exhaustion applies, it would be futile, I can't get

24

what I want, end of the matter.

25

this complexity?

You apply ordinary exhaustion principles.

Okay?

So you

That's -- what is all

I had thought that it might be because

MR. MARTINEZ:

principle.

If I

22

go to Pierce on administrative law, I look up Davis, I

23

will find some words --

MR. MARTINEZ:

JUSTICE BREYER:

What --- and those are the words?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

MR. MARTINEZ:

The words I would suggest are

2

the words that -- that you use are as follows:

3

the hearing officer lacks authority to grant the relief

4

sought -- those are the words of the House report --

5

then exhaustion is not required.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That if

Those are also --

I just want to make sure

7

of the government's position.

8

United States that a FAPE cannot include relief for this

9

sort of problem:

10
11

Is the position of the

Personal assistance during the school

day to accommodate the particular disabilities?
MR. MARTINEZ:

In some circumstances, a FAPE

12

can accommodate that, but we don't think that that's the

13

relevant question for purposes of applying the statute,

14

because the statute turns -- says that the exhaustion

15

question turns on whether the relief that the plaintiff

16

is actually seeking -- those are the terms that the

17

statute uses -- the relief that the civil action is

18

seeking is available under the IDEA.

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think that if -- if -- the

facts of whether a FAPE would -- would allow for the

school to take account of the service dog really isn't

4

the question because the question under the statute

5

turns on what the -- what the person is asking for; what

6

the relief that he seeks.

7

the civil action has to be seeking particular form of

8

relief, and if that --

9

And if the statute says that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All you're talking

10

about -- all you're talking about is artful pleading

11

then.

12

MR. MARTINEZ:

No, not at all, Your Honor.

13

And I want to address your question and the -- and the

14

concerns that came up, the practical concerns about the

15

parents who actually do want -- what they really want is

16

a change to the IEP.

17

If the parent files the lawsuit, the ADA

18

lawsuit, and says I want an injunction that's going to

require the service dog, that is the kind of relief that

20

would have to be exhausted.

that at the end of the day, regardless of whether or not

or file a suit under the ADA or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I don't -- I

don't think that's what you would do, but I guess you're

15

the better judge of that than I am.

(Laughter.)

your position on the question I asked earlier about the

MR. MARTINEZ:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23
24
25

We think --- they're fine with

the FAPE or the IEP, or does it have to be both?
MR. MARTINEZ:

No.

We think that these are

two different, independent reasons why exhaustion is not

2

required here.
The plaintiffs in this case are seeking

3

money damages.

Money damages is not available under the

4

IDEA; therefore, they don't have to exhaust.

5

argument one.

That's

6

Argument two is every one on both sides of

7

this case agrees that a FAPE was provided and that the

8

IDEA was not violated.

9

sense for the Court to say that you need to go to an

It therefore makes very little

10

administrative process so that the question of whether a

11

FAPE was provided in the IDEA process -- the IDEA was

12

violated can be resolved, because both parties already

13

agree on that.

14

Our legal system does not require parties to

15

go into any proceeding in court, in an agency and make

16

arguments that they do not believe are true.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

concession sufficient to answer that question?

19
20
21

MR. MARTINEZ:

So is the parties'

I think the parties'

concession is sufficient to answer that question.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

What if you had a complaint

22

where the parties did concede that IDEA was not

23

violated, that a FAPE had been provided, but as you

24

looked in the allegations in the complaint, it really

25

seems that there is grounds to think that a FAPE was not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

provided and that the IDEA was violated?

2

with a complaint that looks like that?

3

MR. MARTINEZ:

What do you do

I think if the parties agree

4

that the FAPE was provided, that should be enough.

5

I don't think -- because I don't think that the statute

6

has in mind a sort of process by which either a Federal

7

court or an IDEA hearing officer is given some sort of

8

roving commission to go sniff out FAPE and IDEA

9

violations.

10

And

The IDEA haring process is an adversarial

11

process.

12

bring their disagreements forward, bring evidence, and

13

then a decision is made.

14

the hearing officer is supposed to say, well, I know the

15

parties agree that there is no legal violation, but

16

we're going to go ahead and maybe there is one anyway.

17

It depends on the parties to come together,

It's not some of process where

And I think that -- that the rule that

18

Respondents advocate here, which would require people to

19

bring claims that they do not believe has merit, not

20

only is it unheard of in American law, but it actually

21

is inconsistent with the IDEA itself, which would allow

22

for an award of attorney's fees against a parent who

23

brings a claim that's frivolous, unreasonable, or

24

without foundation.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

6

The complaint that was actually filed in

7

this case, in response to Justice Kagan, illustrates the

8

point -- the type of dispute Congress chose to channel

9

through local education experts.

10

They don't have both.

They got neither.

11

The brief in opposition, Appendix page 21,

12

has the complaint's prayer for relief, and it contains

13

three forms of relief that we believe are available

14

under the IDEA.

15

First, a declaration that E.F. was entitled
to attend school with her dog.

MR. KATYAL:

declaration, okay, and that's -- that's number B.

9

then C is --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

the ADA had been violated.

12

MR. MARTINEZ:

And

But the declaration was that

Correct.

And our point is

13

that the statute requires you to look at, is this relief

14

available under the IDEA?

15

Here, the relief --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it's not available;

16

you don't get a declaration that the ADA has been

17

violated or the Rehabilitation Act has been violated

18

from IDEA officer.

19

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely, Justice Kagan.

20

That's -- you know, we couldn't read the statute to --

21

the second half of Section 1415, the exhaustion

22

requirement, to say you've got to show a -- you know,

23

that the IDEA gives that form of relief.

24

think what 1415 does is it has two parts.

25

Really, I

The first, as Mr. Bagenstos started his

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

argument with, was it's about the what.

2

can -- it's about -- it's saying that Smith v. Robinson

3

was wrong; that, basically, you know, there was rights

4

above and beyond the IDEA.

5

It's about what

The second part, though, is the timing.

And

6

it says if you're choosing to bring one of those

7

lawsuits, you got to first exhaust the IDEA procedures

8

if the relief available is one that you could get from

9

the -- from the IDEA.

If you read it to say, oh, you've

10

got to show in -- an IDEA violation, that they've got to

11

ask for an IDEA declaration, then you're essentially

12

gutting the statute.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Katyal, any relief?

14

I mean, that -- the -- again, your furthest argument is

15

that if any relief is available under the IDEA, you must

16

pursue that route first.

17

Congress declined to adopt when it was proposed by the

18

National School Board Association.

19

saying something short of if any relief is available.

20

MR. KATYAL:

But that's exactly what

So -- so you must be

We'd certainly caution the

21

Court about failed legislation, trying to read too much

22

into that.

23

Ginsburg.

24
25

But, you know, you're right, Justice
That's our broadest argument.
And the argument works like this:

The

complaint has invoked the idea that they're seeking any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

appropriate relief.

2

means anything that is available that could be granted

3

by a Federal court.

4

And here, any appropriate relief

If you do --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's boilerplate.

5

That may or may not be significant.

6

concede -- and I couldn't quite tell from your brief --

7

that they will be able to get money damages for

8

everything they're seeking under the ADA in Section 504

9

under the IDEA?

10

MR. KATYAL:

But I -- do you

We don't concede everything,

11

but we do think that they can -- that they get a part.

12

And our red brief at pages 44 to 50 explains here the

13

only thing the complaint seeks is the word "damages."

14

That's at the brief in appendix at page 21.

15

understand the damages, you have to look to the

complaint.

MR. KATYAL:

Correct.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That is -Well, then under

5

Jones case, isn't the rule, well, then, you know, they

6

get to proceed with the things that they're not going to

7

be able to get under the IDEA?

8
9

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely not, Your Honor, for

a few reasons.

10

First, the Jones case itself is -- your --

11

your opinion is about letting good claims go forward

12

versus bad claims.

13

One is a violation of the ADA; the second is a violation

14

of the Rehabilitation Act.

15

Here, there are only two claims.

Now, it is true that one of their prayers

16

for relief is damages.

17

damages, which is what their reply brief paints it out

18

and says it 27 times.

19

in order to -- Jones does not permit, and, indeed, no

20

decision of this Court has ever permitted a plaintiff to

21

try and slice and dice a prayer for relief in one way or

22

another.

23

your opinion a good claim or a bad claim?

24
25

Not, by the way, emotional

It just says "damages."

Rather, the question is:

And so

Is this claim under

Liberty Mutual, your decision in Liberty
Mutual says a claim is a cause of action.

Alderson Reporting Company

And here the

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

question, then, under 1415 is, is the cause of action

2

something that requires exhaustion?

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Here --

When I look at the

4

claimed harms, which the only allegations besides the

5

prayer for relief at the end is in response --

6

Respondent's Appellate 11, 51A through F, every one of

7

those harms alleged is a component of emotional harm.

8

Nowhere are they saying she was harmed by having to pay

9

for -- to pay for a tutoring program, or harmed by her

10

mother losing her job, which is what your brief was

11

talking about.

12

Here, all of the harms alleged are

13

essentially compensatory emotional harms:

14

of equal access; B, the denial of the use of Wonder; C,

15

interference to form bonds with other kids; D, denial of

16

an opportunity to interact with other children.

17

says it very directly:

18

embarrassment, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss

19

of enjoyment.

Those are -- every one of these are the
classic damage harms that are compensatory.

MR. KATYAL:

place in which emotional is isolated is F.

6

course, a non-exhaustive list in paragraph 51.

7

things like interference and denial of the opportunity

8

to interact are exactly the kinds of things IDEA relief

officers provide in the form of counseling.

Well, Mr. Katyal, think of

11

it this way:

public library a couple of times a week and the library

13

said, you can't take your dog here; we're going to just

14

provide you with a librarian who will help you do all

15

the things that your dog otherwise helps you with, and

16

the girl brings a suit.

17

Suppose this girl wanted to go into a

Isn't that suit exactly the suit that she

18

brought, except that instead of a library, it's a

19

school?

20

are her damages, that she was deprived of access to a

21

public facility in a way that caused her distress and

22

emotional harm.

But that's her -- that's her claim and those

23

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Kagan, that may work in

24

that case, as opposed to this one.

25

is a unique exhaustion statute geared to the school

Alderson Reporting Company

That's because 1415

setting.

2

the IDEA -- Congress --

3

It's a carefully calibrated situation where

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But this goes back to

4

Justice Ginsburg's point.

I mean, the entire point of

5

the statute and the overruling of our prior case was

6

Congress saying the fact that the IDEA exists for

7

schools does not mean that you don't have separate ADA

8

and Rehabilitation Act claims.

9

separate kind of claims, which are essentially denial of

And if you bring those

10

access claims to public facilities, and then you're

11

asking in addition to that for a form of damages that

12

has nothing to do with what any IDEA officer can

13

provide, then you can go forward without exhaustion.

14

MR. KATYAL:

That's exactly right in terms

15

of explaining the first half of 1415.

16

explain the second half, the timing provisions of 1415.

17

And to understand this, one nice way of doing it is to

18

just look at the government's brief that they filed in

19

Payne, and this is going back to your question about

20

Jones and Bock.

21

It doesn't

The money damages suit, the government told

22

the Ninth Circuit that a money damages suit would not go

23

forward because implicit in it is a declaration that

24

there is an IDEA violation.

25

So if you -- Mr. Martinez said in response

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

before, if the complaint only sought emotional distress

2

money damages, could that suit go forward?

3

the government said the reverse.

4

that is that when a Federal court awards money damages,

5

the first thing it is doing is issuing a declaration

6

that the underlying problem was a violation in some way

7

or another.

In Payne,

And the reason for

8

So if you accept it, E.F.'s complaint here,

9

what you'd be doing is accepting the idea -- ordering a

10

declaratory judgment that the school --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see that.

12

what -- where -- where I am.

13

from you, if you can give it.

I see this is

I want a quick reaction

14

The problem of deciding against you is not

15

necessarily in this case, but in other cases where, in

16

fact, it would be fairly easy by how you write the word

17

"damages" in your complaint to have judges deciding IEPs

18

without the preliminary negotiation and views of the

19

school board, which would seriously undercut and hurt

20

the -- this statute, which is designed to get the

21

educational plan.

22

The trouble with deciding it your way is, I

23

think, exactly what Justice Kagan said:

Almost anything

24

can be written into an educational plan having to do

25

with the child's day at school.

And, therefore, when

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

there is nothing more to it than a claim that the

2

librarian wrongly kept the dog out of the library -- the

3

school librarian, you wouldn't be able to bring the suit

4

because, after all, you could have written such a

5

thing -- don't keep the dog out of the library -- in the

6

plan.

So what to do?

7

Now, I'm here thinking in the back of my

8

mind of words that have come up in other cases, like

9

"gravamen" of the complaint or -- which we've had in

10

many cases involving sovereign immunity or all kinds of

11

things, which Holmes and, you know, Frankfurter talked

12

about.

What is the gravamen of the complaint?

13

And were we to say, let us look to the

14

gravamen of the complaint, the heart of the complaint,

15

what it's really about.

16

significant matter in respect to the IEP, then you do

17

have to exhaust, unless, of course, it's futile.

18

is not, you don't; and then let the lower courts decide

19

this one.

If what it's really about is a

If it

20

MR. KATYAL:

So three points.

21

First, in response to the first half

22

about -- about whether or not this would gut the

23

exhaustion provision, we absolutely agree.

24

the answer Mr. Bagenstos gave to the Chief Justice in

25

your question about leverage and destroying the kind of

Alderson Reporting Company

And I found

2

right, in that he admitted that this would destroy the

3

carefully wrought system.

4
5

He said that's

Now, second, would ours do that, going to
your other point.

6

Is this going to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought he simply said

7

that if you're going the IDEA route, you must pursue it

8

to the end.

9

We're asking the same thing that we would ask if this

But he said, we're not going the ADA route.

10

child didn't have an IEP.

11

the facilities.

12

MR. KATYAL:

We are asking for access to

As I understood his answer,

13

Justice Ginsburg, to the question is that, yes, a lawyer

14

could walk in on day one and sue for money damages, and

15

then -- and then extort or possibly leverage that into a

16

better situation in terms of money.

17

from the school board explains that this actually

18

happens in real life.

The amicus brief

19

Now, with respect to the concern that you

20

had, I think this case is an easy one because in this

21

case the IEP, the complaint itself says the IEP denied

22

the dog.

23

Justice Kagan's first question, orders a declaratory

24

judgment, which is what they sought expressly, then

25

you'd be calling the IEP into question.

If a Federal district court, going back to

Alderson Reporting Company

That's why the

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what does that say

3

other than it's a recitation of fact?

4

and it didn't include the dog.

5

MR. KATYAL:

There was an IEP,

And what that means is, if the

6

Federal district court said, here are money damages,

7

because you denied the dog, implicit in that -- and this

8

is the government's brief in Payne as well as this

9

Court's own decision in Fair v. McNary, which I'll

10

explain in a moment.

11

declaratory judgment that the government -- that the

12

school erred and that itself called the IEP into

13

question.

14

That means that there is a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the Plaintiffs here are

15

not suggesting that the IEP was deficient.

16

saying the IEP was perfectly efficient.

17

at are the kinds of educational criteria that IEPs

18

usually look at, then the dog isn't necessary.

19

dog is necessary for is things that don't have anything

20

to do with the IEP, is what the plaintiffs say.

21

after all, that's what they are saying, and that's what

22

they are seeking.

23

that we ought to look to.

24
25

They are

If all you look

What the

And

And that's what this statute suggests

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Kagan, I think that's

wrong on the facts on the law.

On the facts, I don't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

think you can affirm on that theory.

2

theory that they have put through this Court that

3

somehow they've conceded there's no FAPE violation.

4

complaint itself --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This is a new

The

Mr. Katyal, you're --

6

you're supposed to look at a complaint as a whole, okay,

7

at the moment it's filed.

8
9

What's clear in this complaint, because the
allegations say it, this is what happened.

It didn't

10

have it in the IDEA.

We asked them to do it; they

11

didn't do it.

12

we've placed our child in another school.

13

paragraph that says, She is now happily in another

14

school that welcomes her and her dog.

They finally agreed to do it, and then

15

MR. KATYAL:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They have a

Okay?

Correct.
They then talk about all

17

the emotional distress.

At that moment, either because

18

of futility, because she can't change the IDEA at a

19

school she no longer attends, the school she is in is

20

already giving her her dog, there is no declaratory

21

relief being sought that her current IDEA is

22

deficient -- forget about the past one -- is deficient.

23

Why in the world, at the moment she filed the complaint,

24

would she have to go back or should have gone to the

25

school earlier?

She no longer is seeking anything

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

related to the IDEA facet.

2

MR. KATYAL:

So, Justice Sotomayor, two

3

answers, and we agree with you, absolutely.

Read the

4

text of the complaint as we were having that interchange

5

earlier.

6

paragraphs you read, talk about how the denial of the

7

dog undermined her independence.

8

one of the three statutory goals, and this is in 20

9

U.S.C. 1400(d)(1), is independence.

The text of the complaint, including the

And part of the IDEA,

That's why your

10

former colleagues on the Second Circuit --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We are now getting -- we

12

are now going past where I am, okay, or you're going

13

behind what I'm saying but not getting to the point,

14

Mr. Katyal.

15

Maybe, before she changed schools, she might

16

have been entitled to something related to her IDEA, but

17

at the moment this complaint was filed, on its own face,

18

where is it asking for any change, potentially or

19

otherwise, to the IDEA that is no longer in effect?

20
21
22

MR. KATYAL:

And that is my second answer to

you.
So the second answer is the complaint asks

23

for a declaratory judgment, and that's what we were

24

talking about at the beginning, to ask for declaratory

25

judgment under this Court's decision in Golden v.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

Zwickler and City of Lyons, the only way they can invoke

2

Article III jurisdiction is by saying there is a

3

reasonable prospect that the situation would occur.

4

There is not a word in the complaint that says she won't

5

return to the school, and indeed, the Sixth Circuit

6

grapples with this all the time, when children leave the

7

school and file these lawsuits.

8

There is a case called Woods, which is at

9

487 Federal Appendix 979, and what that case says is,

10

even if you leave the school, the school has an ongoing

11

obligation to keep an IEP current in case the person

12

comes back to the school.

13

If you adopted, if the Federal district

14

court granted their declaratory judgment, the only way

15

they can do so, and the only way they can invoke Article

16

III processes is by saying, look, there is a chance E.F.

17

might come back.

18

And that happens all the time.

That

19

happens, you know, in the Payne case itself.

People

20

file lawsuits.

21

come back.

That's what they asked for, Justice

22

Sotomayor.

They didn't ask -- and, indeed, the Sixth

23

Circuit briefing is very clear on this point.

24

never asked for emotional damages, or even the word

25

"damages" doesn't appear --

They leave the school, and then they

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would you fit into the

2

Payne three criteria, the Ninth Circuit's three

3

criteria?

4

MR. KATYAL:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

That -- that -The Ninth Circuit uses

to evaluate --

7

MR. KATYAL:

Yes.

So we think that if

8

there's a denial, that -- that they can't just concede

9

and say, oh, we think there is no FAPE violation, and

10

then that allows an end-run around 1415.

11

Rather, we think 1415 asks:

12

available?

13

available, it's not a subjective inquiry.

14

plaintiff-centered.

15

relief available?

16

Is the relief

And to understand whether the relief is

It's got to be:

It can't be

Objectively, is

So just --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How much relief -- going

17

back to what you said before, I think you told me you're

18

not pressing any relief.

19

MR. KATYAL:

So how much relief?
Well, I -- I do think that if

20

the complaint seeks relief that is available under the

21

IDEA, then at least that claim can't go forward, going

22

back to the Jones v. Bock thing.

23

So, if, for example, Justice Ginsburg, you

24

had a claim like the dog one here and then you had a

25

separate claim that said something like the child was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

being abused in the bathroom or something like that,

2

something that didn't implicate a FAPE or an IDEA,

3

certainly I think that claim could go forward.

4

separate claim.

5

That's a

It's a good claim under Jones v. Bock.

What can't go forward is something like

6

this, because Congress had this in mind.

They had the

7

idea that you -- that a plaintiff can gut 1415 by

8

saying, oh, I don't want IDEA violation.

9

I don't want IDEA relief.

I just want --

I want money damages, because

10

then they could file that lawsuit on day one, evade the

11

cooperative process that Congress has set forth, get

12

relief from the district court, and then, by res

13

judicata --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The cooperative

15

process -- the cooperative process you're talking about,

16

given their position that they are not asking for any

17

relief under the FAPE, would be kind of a charade.

18

get into the -- the meeting room, and they say, well, we

19

don't want anything that you can give us.

20

that's not available.

21

MR. KATYAL:

You

We want money

We certainly agree that if it

22

triggers that kind of futility exception, if they

23

literally can't get the relief for one reason or

24

another, absolutely, they don't have to go through it --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Here -- here this might

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

also be peripheral.

2

who is not blind so is not subject to the regulations.

3

They have a teacher who is going around, or a person who

4

is acting as a guide within the school, and this is, to

5

that degree, a peripheral matter in respect to the plan,

6

and, perhaps, at least arguably, more like the librarian

7

in the school who -- or the person who does beat up

8

somebody or treat them badly, which could be the subject

9

but a pretty minor part of an IEP.

10

I mean, this is a dog for a child

MR. KATYAL:

So this is going back to

11

something I was trying to get to earlier about your

12

second half of your question.

13

there is a circumstance in which the IEP or FAPE

14

processes are not directly implicated in some way,

15

that's a different case.

16

Look, we agree that if

That's not this one.

In this one, you have them seeking, invoking

17

the IEP process for the very same thing they are asking

18

the Federal district court to do, which is a declaration

19

that the school erred by not --

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't understand that,

21

Mr. Katyal.

I mean, you yourself have an example in

22

your brief of abuse towards a handicapped disabled

23

student that would result in money damages and maybe

24

emotional distress, but maybe also the parents took the

25

kid out of school and -- and is asking for the school

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

to -- the private school tuition that they had to incur,

2

so all kinds of things.

3

not because of anything that the IEP said or didn't say.

4

It was because there was discrimination on the basis of

5

disability.

6

But it was -- it was -- it was

Now, it was in a school, and it could be

7

remedied by school-type things, like stop discriminating

8

or abusing against a disabled student.

9

your briefs say that doesn't have anything to do with

10

the IDEA.

11

But even you in

And so why isn't this the same thing?
MR. KATYAL:

Because -- because,

12

Justice Kagan, as that page, page 37, explains, a lot of

13

lower courts have said that when you have a discrete

14

instance of abuse, that doesn't violate the IDEA --

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

instance.

17

abuse?

18

I don't -- discrete

How about if you had a continuing stream of

MR. KATYAL:

If it's a continuing stream of

19

abuse, something that does implicate IDEA processes and

20

deny FAPE, absolutely it would require exhaustion in

21

that circumstance.

22
23
24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The IDEA doesn't care about

particular instances but cares about -MR. KATYAL:

But, Mr. Katyal, are you

8

suggesting that there is no such thing as continuing

discrimination that happens in a school setting that

10

actually does not have anything to do with the IEP?

MR. KATYAL:

To an extent -- to the extent

12

that something like that exists, we're not -- our

disabled in some way but who do not get an IEP.

22

there is discrimination or if there is a failure to

23

provide access to one of those students you don't have

24

to exhaust the IDEA procedure, do you?

25

There are close to a million students who are

MR. KATYAL:

So if

Well, I'd caution the Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

into saying the IEP is the only thing that's necessary.

2

But the IEP is a good template.

3

Honig, it's the kind of center piece of the IDEA.

4

a good template for whether or not there is an IDEA

5

violation.

6

a pretty good proxy.

7

circumstance like this in which they have tried -- they

invoked the IDEA process for the dog.

As this Court said in

It may not always map on perfectly, but it's
And so when you have a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They invoked --

I'm not sure I understood

the answer to the question.

11

send the -- the -- the child to the IDEA officer, would

12

you?

13

MR. KATYAL:

In that case, you would not

Well -- well, Justice Kagan,

you talked about a million different possible

JUSTICE KAGAN:

700,000, if I can read what

So -- so some of

19

those may be circumstance in which for one reason or

20

another the IEP just didn't govern the situation, but

21

should.

22

exhaustion would be required.

23

more like the examples in our page 37, the kind of

24

discrete one-off things, those are situations when

25

absolutely they wouldn't require exhaustion in those

to, then go through that first.

the -- there will often be situations where parents will

seek relief under the IDEA and then be told early in the

process or whatever -- maybe the school will tell them

14

we can't do that and here's why.

15

think, okay, so it isn't available.

We're not going to

16

pursue that relief under the IDEA.

We're instead going

17

to sue under the ADA.

MR. KATYAL:

And the parents will

they say, look, we lack the authority to --

No, no, they say,

you know, we could press ahead with this.

down with them and say, no, you got to do this and that,

but it's going to be easier for us just to proceed under

25

MR. KATYAL:

We could sit

Yeah, and the choice Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

made in 1415, and going back to an earlier question, I

2

know it seems a little bit unusual to say -- and strange

to say, why are you forcing plaintiff -- parents into

go to the meeting and say, we don't want anything.

18

MR. KATYAL:

It's -- it's really awkward,

19

Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what Congress said there

20

is it's not up to the individual parents subjectively to

21

say, hey, I don't want any part of this process.

22

what Congress said is you got to go through the process,

23

and then at the end of the process, and then at the end

24

of the 105 days -- this is a very short statutory

process -- then you can come into Federal court.

different hypothetical.

And I want to -- I

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Yes, I understand.

And --

and I will answer the hypothetical.

13

And so I think the answer there is the Jones

14

case, right?

15

-- when you have one part of a complaint that is seeking

16

relief that is not barred by an exhaustion requirement

17

and another part that is barred, the thing to do is let

18

the good part of the complaint proceed and leave the bad

19

part of the complaint by the wayside.

20
21
22

I mean, Jones does say that when you have

And I want to respond to what my opponents
said about -- about Jones and what claim means in Jones.
In Jones itself, this Court cited, as an

23

example of a court applying the right approach, a case

24

from the Seventh Circuit, Cassidy v. Indiana Department

25

of Corrections.

If you look at Cassidy, what Cassidy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

did was it said, well, some requests for some relief are

2

allowed to proceed, and requests for other relief by the

3

same plaintiff are not allowed to proceed.

4

thing to do is apply the Jones partial exhaustion rule,

5

which this Court said is the general rule in that case.

So the right

6

If this Court concludes that our complaint

7

might be read to embrace -- notwithstanding everything

8

we've said -- might be read to embrace requests for

9

anything that might be available in IDEA proceedings,

10

the proper thing to do is allow the damages claim to

11

proceed forward.

MR. BAGENSTOS:

18

some circumstances, the Court actually addressed

19

something similar to this in the Rhines case, which is

20

cited in Jones about habeas where a total exhaustion

21

rule applies.

22

And even Rhines said that staying is

23

something that shouldn't be done as a matter of routine;

24

it might be something done occasionally as a matter of

25

discretion, but that the ordinary process should be even
