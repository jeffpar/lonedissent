ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

For three reasons, acquittals should have

12

full effect under the Double Jeopardy Clause without

13

regard to invalid vacated convictions.

14

First, vacated convictions are legal

15

nullities, including under the Double Jeopardy Clause.

16

Second, vacated convictions are not relevant to what a

17

jury necessarily decided.

18

should bear the consequences when overlapping charges

19

produce split verdicts of acquittals and invalid

20

convictions.

21

And third, the government

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I take it from that you

22

would agree that there might be cases where, under

23

Ashe v. Swenson, there's an acquittal on one count,

24

conviction on the other count, conviction set aside,

25

government can retry the count that had been set aside,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

on the ground that under Ashe v. Swenson the verdict on

2

the other count was just irrelevant.

3

MS. BLATT:

That's right.

So we -- the

4

defendant always has to meet the burden of just showing

5

that the acquittal necessarily decided a fact that the

6

government wants to prove in a subsequent prosecution.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In this case, could it be

8

argued -- was the argument before the jury on the

9

conspiracy in the travel counts closely intertwined with

10

666 so that it -- you can't say the jury decided most

11

likely on some issue that's irrelevant to 666?

12

MS. BLATT:

Right.

The only issue -- the

13

only issue that was in dispute was whether there was a

14

bribe.

15

Puerto Rico, you have to travel.

16

that they agreed to go to a boxing match together.

17

the only dispute at all was whether there was a bribe.

18

There's no dispute that to get to Las Vegas from
There was no dispute
So

And so when the jury acquitted on conspiracy

19

and travel to commit Program Section 666, bribery, they

20

necessarily decided there was no bribery.

21

Now, the Court of Appeals did not hold that.

22

It was just Petitioners' argument throughout the case, a

23

point that the government just never disputed, a point

24

that the government never disputed in its brief in

25

opposition, and a point that the government never

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

disputed in its brief on the merits.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Blatt -- but if we're

3

trying to figure out what this jury found, you know,

4

we're not what talking about claim preclusion.

5

preclusion -- there can never be a new trial on the

6

travel or the conspiracy.

7

preclusion.

8
9

Claim

But we're talking about issue

And this jury, we don't know what it decided
because of the inconsistency.

It said yes to bribery on

10

one; no to bribery on the other.

11

decided that conviction of the predicate offense, the

12

bribery, was enough, and that the government had laid it

13

on too strong by adding the conspiracy and the travel

14

count.

15
16

And it might have just

How do we know that's not what the jury
decided?

17

MS. BLATT:

Well, we know, just looking at

18

the acquittals alone, that we know what they decided.

19

So the question is -- and it's, I think, under Yeager

20

and under the Double Jeopardy Clause -- is this Court,

21

for the first time in the history of its jurisprudence,

22

going to give any meaning to or relevance to an invalid

23

conviction?

24
25

You have never held an invalid conviction
was relevant to or evidence of anything,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

Justice Ginsburg, and let me just suggest the last place

2

you should start is the Double Jeopardy Clause, where

3

illegal, invalid, vacated convictions always been legal

4

nullities.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Blatt, it does seem to

6

me that's what your argument rests on in the end:

7

idea that we shouldn't give any weight or any influence

8

to an invalid conviction.

9

principle, or does it come from someplace else?

10

MS. BLATT:

The

Is that a double jeopardy

Both.

So we have our main -- I

11

would call it our legal argument, is just that vacated

12

convictions are legal nullities, void ab initio.

13

pretend that they just don't exist.

14
15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

You

Well, why do we do

that?

16

I mean, I take it you have -- you know,

17

usually you do pretend that they don't exist.

18

not many instances that we can find where we do look to

19

vacated convictions for something or other.

20

case, the vacated conviction surely does tell us

21

something about what the jury did do or what the jury

22

didn't do.

23

question has to be, well, notwithstanding that, why

24

shouldn't we look at it?

25

There are

But in this

It's part of the factual picture, and so the

MS. BLATT:

And I guess the -- why?
Right.

Well, so, again, there's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

the legal argument, which I do want to get back to, but

2

on the factual argument, in Yeager, it was never

3

disputed, and it was beyond obvious that a jury that

4

acquits cannot rationally hang.

5

historical fact, and the dissent was all up in arms that

6

the jury decisions were completely inconsistent.

7

was at least relevant under 401 that the jury, if it was

8

going to acquit, it could not have hung.

9

There is this

And it

And the Court said, I think, three things.

10

But the most -- and I think as a factual matter, you

11

don't know what a jury decides when there's an illegal

12

conviction.

13

doesn't decide anything in a hung count.

14

the Court said in Yeager.

Just like a hung count, which a jury
That's what

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You know, I think you're

16

contesting the premise of my question.

17

premise of my question is that this vacated conviction

18

does tell you something about what the jury did.

19

what it tells you is that the jury did inconsistent

20

things, because the vacated conviction tells you that,

21

on the one hand, the valid convictions, the jury said

22

that there was not bribery.

23

vacated conviction, the jury said there was bribery.

Because the

Now

And on the other hand, the

24

And let's assume for the moment that that's

25

true, that that is exactly what the vacated convictions

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

tell you.

They tell you that the jury went in two

2

inconsistent ways.

3

MS. BLATT:

Right.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And now you're saying,

5

notwithstanding that the vacated conviction tells you

6

something about what the jury did or didn't do about how

7

the jury reasoned, we shouldn't look at it.

8
9

And there's something very powerful,
rhetorically, in your statement.

10

trying to figure out:

11

rhetoric?

But I guess what I'm

Is it anything more than

Is --

12

MS. BLATT:

Yeah, let me --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- there, like, a legal

14

principle here about why we shouldn't look to vacated

15

convictions to tell us something about the facts, when

16

they can tell us something about the facts?

17

MS. BLATT:

Sure.

Let me prove it to you.

18

I mean, I'm happy to prove it, that the only reason you

19

vacate a conviction is because the conviction is a

20

worthless piece of paper and unreliable.

21

how an error inversely affects acquittals and

22

convictions proves the point.

23

render the conviction completely worthless and

24

unreliable, an error in the face of an acquittal has the

25

opposite effect of making the acquittal all that more

And at looking

Because whereas errors

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

meaningful, reliable, and worthy of respect.
JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm not sure that really

3

answers the question.

4

may be worthless for a reason that is irrelevant to the

5

point that Justice Kagan was making, which seems to be

6

the situation here.

7

because an element was missing, but that doesn't

8

undermine the argument that the two verdicts were

9

inconsistent.

10

Because the vacated conviction

It's -- it's a wrongful conviction

MS. BLATT:

So the reason why Yeager -- I

11

mean, Yeager said -- I don't think any dispute, and this

12

is the government's whole argument.

13

mattered was there was no jury decision.

14

reason why you care about jury decisions --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yeager, all that
And the only

But the Yeager case

16

was -- the jury didn't reach any decision.

17

jury did reach a decision.

18

because, in the court's view, the charge was erroneous.

19

The decision was vacated

By the way, that's not -- it's not clear

20

that the charge was erroneous, is it?

21

on that issue.

22

Here, your

MS. BLATT:

There's a split

It's clear as it comes to this

23

Court, but I think, you know, I'd have to go back and

24

read Sun Diamond, which is --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question is --

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. BLATT:

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

it gratuity as well?

4

circuit split.

5

MS. BLATT:

Is whether to quid pro quo.
Is it quid pro quo, or is

As I understand it, there's a

Right.

And the government's

6

position is, if the court had directed a verdict and

7

said, you must find guilty, and the jury both acquit and

8

convict, you still have a piece of relevant information

9

that the jury acted inconsistency -- inconsistently.

10

And what I'm trying to say about a jury

11

verdict is that it doesn't count in our legal system

12

unless it's imbued with finality and validity.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But why is that true

14

when you can have a set-aside of the verdict that's

15

independent of the jury charge?

16

situation, like in the State of Michigan, where the

17

conviction was set aside because the defendant was

18

deprived of his right to proceed pro se.

19

still a complete inconsistency between the acquittal and

20

the conviction.

21

the nature of the charge.

22

situation we should be ignoring --

23

MS. BLATT:

You can have a

There, there's

The set-aside had nothing to do with
Why would you say in that

So I think for errors like

24

Feretta and Gonzalez-Lopez, right to counsel and a few

25

other kind of nutty structural errors, where the Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

has never said it's prejudicial, but we're going to

2

treat it as such, because you can't unwind the apple

3

cart.

4

judge, absences of counsel, you know, a Brady violation,

5

a directed verdict, a reasonable doubt instruction, they

6

are prejudicial.

7
8

But for all other errors, including a biased

And when a --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what do they have to

do to impeach the inconsistent act of the jury?

9

MS. BLATT:

Okay.

So what -- exactly what

10

they had to do in Yeager, because then the other reason

11

that Yeager held that hung counts were not relevant is

12

because they were indecipherable.

13

It is because they are indecipherable the defendant

14

can't be put to the impossible burden of reconciling

15

with the acquittal, even though they may be reconcilable

16

in ways that don't undermine the acquittal.

17

And this part is key.

And vacation -- vacated convictions are the

18

same.

19

because of it, no one knows and no one can know why the

20

jury convicted.

21

not be put in the impossible burden of explaining that

22

the consistency -- that the inconsistency is on a point

23

that's not relevant to the acquittals.

24
25

Let me explain why.

The instructional error,

And therefore, the defendants should

And so here's the example we gave in the
brief, is that all 12 jurors -- and the -- this is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

the -- this is the point of the -- the error itself

2

causing the inconsistency.

3

thought Petitioners were not guilty of a crime, of a

4

quid pro quo exchange.

5

only inconsistency, is they were divided on whether

6

there was a lawful gratuity.

7

All 12 jurors could have

And the only inconsistency, the

And so in that case, it's completely

8

possible that the verdicts are consistent on the only

9

relevant question.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

I'm sorry.

I --

Yeah, but we don't

know.

13

MS. BLATT:

Exactly.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, that's the

15

whole point.

16

have the burden, as I understand it, under the law, of

17

carrying the burden of indicating that -- a double

18

jeopardy violation.

19

carry that burden.

20

And then it -- well, exactly, except you

And if you don't know, you can't

MS. BLATT:

So unlike an acquittal, this is

21

just Yeager all over again.

Yeager said we -- because

22

you can't ask the jury what transpired in the courtroom,

23

the burden is not on the defendant to reconcile it.

24

know when you have a final invalid jury verdict,

25

Mr. Chief Justice, what the jury found.

Alderson Reporting Company

You

And that's the

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

only reason that final invalid jury verdicts have

2

ever -- have ever counted under our system at all.

3

Without the finality --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't understand why

5

you're saying we don't know why the jury convicted on

7

It convicted because the evidence was

8

MS. BLATT:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

MS. BLATT:

Well, it convicted on 666 -That's why it convicted.

-- on a charge that allowed it

11

to convict based on completely lawful conduct.

12

the jury -- the evidence could have been overwhelming.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So if

I understand there was an

But we know why the jury

16

MS. BLATT:

No.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The jury could have -Because under the --

18

because under the erroneous instruction, they clearly

19

found the facts of a violation.

20

elements the government asserted were found to be true.

21

MS. BLATT:

All of the factual

Under the wrong -- under

22

something that's not a crime.

If they had charged the

23

jury that if the defendant were wearing glasses, they

24

committed a crime, and the jury returns a guilty

25

verdict, you shouldn't care.

You can't just say, well,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

it's a guilty verdict.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the jury was

3

operating under the same charge with respect to the

4

compound crimes.

5

had to find there was neither quid pro quo nor gratuity.

6

That's what it would have had to find, which would be

7

inconsistent with finding --

8
9

So in order to convict, it would have

MS. BLATT:

So it's actually inverse.

To

convict, all the jury had to do was find one out of two

10

possibilities.

11

they found a lawful gratuity or an unlawful bribe.

12

to acquit, Justice Ginsburg, the jury had to reject and

13

consider all of the government's theories of criminal

14

liability.

15

to -- there's no way to read them other than the jury

16

acquitted Petitioners of a crime.

17

The jury could have convicted either if
But

So you know the acquittals, there's no way

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the question I

asked you before?

19

jury did, isn't it a reasonable assumption that they

20

convicted on the bribery for which there was much

21

evidence?

22

the conspiracy and the travel, was just laying it on too

23

thick, so they weren't going to convict on those.

24

couldn't that have been?

25

If we're trying to find out what this

They thought that having the compound crimes,

MS. BLATT:

Yeah.

Why

I think -- I mean, it's

the same case in Yeager where the Court said, look,

2

there's an apparent inconsistency.

3

that the verdicts were irreconcilable, and that who --

4

who knows?

No one questioned

astonished if you were saying, well, we know they

There is a reason why this Court has

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the Court

Under your argument, the

23

trial court could instruct the jury:

24

on 666 and if you find that there was travel, you must

25

find that there was guilt under the travel section as

That's what you're saying.

2
3

MS. BLATT:

I'm actually -- that one, I'm

lost on what you're asking.

4

Sorry.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you're saying in

5

answer to Justice Ginsburg's question that the jury

6

can't make different decisions with multiple counts.

7

based on your theory, the trial court can instruct the

8

jury:

9

the others, if you find there was travel.

If you find guilt on 666, you must find guilt on

MS. BLATT:

Right.

And our position works

no matter what kind of error you have.

improper instruction.

15

MS. BLATT:

It is an improper instruction.

16

And the question is, is if the instruction is

17

prejudicial in a way that renders the decision not

18

final, invalid, it can't be any more relevant evidence

19

than the jury's just refusal to find anything.

5

these vacated convictions don't themselves bar retrial

6

under the Double Jeopardy Clause is because this Court

7

has, over and over and over, called them complete

8

nullities.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Maybe one way I can figure

10

out the scope of your argument is just to ask, do you

11

think that the government is always unable to use a

12

vacated conviction, that is for any purpose, or do you

13

think that the government is unable to use a vacated

14

conviction only for double jeopardy purposes?

15
16

MS. BLATT:

This Court has never used a

vacated conviction for any purpose, period.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

So you have the history on

18

your side, most of it.

19

the government, you know, cannot use a vacated

20

conviction for any purpose?

21

MS. BLATT:

Do you think that that's because

Yes.

I mean, since Blackstone,

What is the

Why can't the government use a vacated

MS. BLATT:

7

the Double Jeopardy Clause.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why -Look at the label.

It's

void ab initio, but I mean, it's void in the sense that

10

you can't be punished for a vacated conviction.

11

question is, can we use what the vacated conviction

12

tells us about a historical fact, or can we use it for

13

some other purpose that, you know, that I'm not thinking

14

about right now?

MS. BLATT:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but that's -But -- but, you know,

MS. BLATT:

Well, except that I a.m. saying

Yeager does defeat what you're saying.

ab initio, there's a reason that invalid convictions are

void ab initio -- and I don't want to leave the Double

its cake and eat it -- eat it too.

they're complete nullities under United States versus

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Justice Alito.

They lack legal effect, but

13

it is a historical fact that it occurs.

So surely they

14

can be used to prove a historical fact.

For example,

15

suppose there's a case in which the -- in which the

16

question is whether a witness who testified for the

17

prosecution was bribed.

18

could be used in that situation, right?

19

MS. BLATT:

Surely the -- the conviction

I guarantee you if that

testimony was struck from the record, it's gone.

disappeared.

22

No, it didn't --

23

It

And here that's what we're talking about.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

You're

24

suggesting that if there's a retrial in a vacated

25

conviction that you can't use the testimony that was

Alderson Reporting Company

elicited during that conviction?

That was bribed, and the court

struck from the record.

as I understand it.

His hypothetical is the juror

All right.
Can that witness be

MS. BLATT:
Absolutely.

19

Oh, yeah.

Sorry.

Yes.

Our question is -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So then -- and then his

20

point could follow this; the conviction can be used for

21

some things.

22

MS. BLATT:

You're not using the conviction.

23

You're using the witness's testimony.

You can use

24

evidence that's introduced in an invalid conviction for

25

other purposes.

The question is are you -- the only

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

thing we're talking about is the verdict on its face

2

that's invalid.

3

convict on preponderance of the evidence.

4

piece of paper that the government's relying on in

5

saying the jury necessarily found guilt.

6

in the way the law recognizes.

7

The same way if you had said you can
It's just the

It's not guilt

But I do think there's something quite

8

unseemly about when the Court in Yeager said if you have

9

the continuing -- if hung counts are void and a nonevent

10

under the continuing jeopardy principle, they're also

11

void and nonevents under Ashe.

12

has it -- well, they got to count -- they at least count

13

for something when it helps us, in it's not only

14

rendering the clause incoherent but kind of perverse.

15

And here the government

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but the basic

16

point that was made in Yeager made over and over again

17

is that when the jury is hung, the jury hasn't done

anything.

19

carry the burden that the jury hasn't done anything.

20

we're right back to the typical Ashe case.

So the defendant in that case was able to

Now what you're

saying -- and the way you phrase things, I think, is

significant.

the jury might have done this.

don't know what the jury did.

You said, well, what do we know?

Well, that means you
And again, it seems to me

that, I guess, everybody agrees it's the defendant's

burden, and it's different than a hung jury.

that you can put that much reliance on Yeager.

MS. BLATT:

The hung

When there's a
They may have

And let me look at -- let's look

Powell is a case where you had a valid

It's just -- that is what Yeager said, that

20

Powell means acquittals can't be undermined by hung

counts.

22

by invalid verdicts either.

23

Well, they shouldn't be able to be undermined

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When the acquittal isn't

undermined in that it has claim preclusive effect, those

acquittals are final.

They are done.

Alderson Reporting Company

These people can

conspiracy offense.

3

right to say the acquittals don't count under the

4

government -- I mean, yes, they do count.

5

So it's not -- I think you're not

MS. BLATT:

And that was the very argument

made by, you know, the government in Yeager, is who

7

cares about the acquittals, because they are going to

8

count.

9

have to have the full effect with Ashe --

10

But the Court said, no, to really count, you

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because there was nothing

11

on the other side in Yeager.

12

hung -- the jury says we can't decide.

13

MS. BLATT:

Right.

If you say a hung jury, a

And I think a rotten

14

apple is worse than, you know, the orange in Yeager.

15

You basically had an apple and an orange.

Here you have

16

something infected with reversible error.

And just the

17

irony that it has never been counted by this Court --

18
19
20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The error had nothing to

do with the inconsistency.
MS. BLATT:

Yes, it -- well, it could have.

21

It definitely could have.

22

inconsistency, but it was precisely because we can't

23

know, the defendant could never meet the burden of

24

reconciling the acquittals with the hung counts.

25

It could have caused the

And that was what Yeager was saying, is,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

sure, the defendant has the burden, but we're not going

2

to give them the impossible burden of explaining, well,

3

if the jury acquitted, what were they doing hanging?

4

one could ever reconcile that imponderable.

5

complete inconsistency.

6

looks kind of inconsistent, but we just -- we're not

really sure what a hung count is.

what they did.

No

It was a

decision at all.

13

It didn't say we're not

It said a hung count is equivalent to no

at all.

convicted.

17

withheld the crucial confession of the real killer.

18

They didn't have a lawyer.

They unanimously found him guilty.

Again, the government's position is the jury

21

Sure, it was a coerced confession that

But it's a piece of paper.
Oh, and there was a

But it sure says, well, it has a lot of

22

meaning to us, because it's evidence of inconsistency.

23

And it should -- and the jury acquits.

And you say, oh,

24

well, that's just an acquittal.

Well, they can't

retry him.

Okay.

Acquittals -- I mean, the acquittal has to

mean something under Ashe more than just, you know, the

3

jury -- you have to assume that the jury necessarily

found him not guilty of the elements.

5

supposition of this case.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That is the

You're -- you're saying it

7

is highly doubtful if the government had charged just

8

counts 2 and 3 and got an acquittal, and that they could

9

then have had a second trial under 666.

10

that just couldn't happen under Ashe v. Swenson.

11
12
13

You're saying

MS. BLATT:
Yes.

Yes.

That's exactly right.

Yes.

Yes, yes, yes.
And the point I'm making about once you have

14

the acquittal is that -- and I do think this was going

15

on in Yeager, because the whole point of the

16

government's brief is we get one complete opportunity.

17

Yeah, I know it's a nullity, but let's pretend it's not

18

really a nullity here.

19

complete opportunity.

20

But at least we need one

And there were a lot of questions about why

21

should the principles of Ashe outweigh?

22

was because of sort of the -- the special status

23

acquittals have.

24

said their unassailability is the most fundamental rule

25

in the history of double jeopardy law, and the primary

They're sacrosanct.

Alderson Reporting Company

And the answer

The Court has

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

purpose of the clause is to protect their integrity.

2

And the Court said the fact you've already

3

got an acquittal after running the gauntlet and staring

4

down the barrel of the government's gun -- and here it

5

was really a firing squad -- that should count for

6

something.

7

of permitting it.

8

special, our position is the government should give you

9

something pretty good if they're going to impeach it.

10

It should count for barring retrial instead
And because acquittals are so

And if the hung count nondecisions weren't

11

good enough in Yeager, it's hard to see how the rotten,

12

infected apple with a worm should be good enough here.

Can I reserve the rest?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH S. PRELOGAR

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

20

MS. PRELOGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The most essential prerequisite for applying

21

collateral estoppel is that the jury must have actually

22

decided an issue in the defendant's favor, and that

23

prerequisite isn't satisfied here.

24

Petitioner's jury returned inconsistent

25

verdicts, convicting them of the standalone bribery

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

offense that they're seeking to preclude relitigation of

2

now, but also acquitting them of offenses involving

3

bribery as a predicate.

4

verdicts cannot be reconciled.

5

inconsistent.

6

occurred, and that the jurors must have neglected to

7

follow the instructions with respect to that count.

8

Because of that, this case falls within

9

And it's undisputed that those
They are indisputably

Because of that, we know that error

Powell's recognition that when a jury issues

10

inconsistent verdicts, a defendant can't point to the

11

acquittal and say that that acquittal necessarily

12

resolved any facts in the defendant's favor.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But suppose the

14

hypothetical were -- just conspiracy and travel are

15

charged, and there's an acquittal.

16

on 666?

17

MS. PRELOGAR:

Could you then try

No, because in that

18

situation, there would be nothing in the record to

19

indicate that the jury had done anything other than

20

follow their instructions, apply a lot of facts, and

21

make factual findings in the defendant's favor.

22

situation is different when the jury returns

23

inconsistent verdicts, because there, we have conclusive

24

evidence that something went wrong; the jury erred, it

25

wasn't following its instructions.

Alderson Reporting Company

But the

And so when the

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

charges are brought at the same time, as they were here,

2

and the jury acts inconsistently, we lack that

3

confidence that the acquittal is actually a reflection

4

of findings in the defendant's favor.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you agree with

6

Ms. Blatt's statement that the government has never

7

before sought to gain a benefit from a vacated

8

conviction?

9

MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, I think that it's

10

important to separate out the use of the vacated

11

conviction.

12

conviction can't be used to establish the defendant's

13

guilt of that charge.

14

conviction is vacated forecloses reliance on the

15

conviction for that purpose.

16

It's certainly the case that a vacated

The -- the fact that the

But we're not relying on the conviction for

17

that purpose here.

18

only the jury's inconsistency.

19

fact.

20

that actually occurred.

21

We're looking at it to establish
That's a historical

It's -- it's a matter on this historical record

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What other purpose could you

22

use a vacated conviction for?

23

that the government can use a vacated conviction for, or

24

is this the only thing?

25

MS. PRELOGAR:

Is there anything else

I think it can use it to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

establish any kind of historical fact when -- when

2

that's the purpose to which the conviction is being put.

3

And we cite a number of lower court cases that look at

4

vacated convictions to establish things like motive for

5

a -- for a subsequent crime, which would establish the

6

defendant's plan or intent.

7

So there are situations where it's really

8

the existence of the conviction that tells us something

9

about what actually happened with facts on the ground,

10

that I think the conviction is relevant for.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Who -- who's not --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you use it in a

13

civil case?

14

civil case to impose civil liability?

15

know, the jury obviously found that you did this; there

16

was an instruction on the criminal aspect but didn't --

17

but you did this act, and that's collateral estoppel, or

18

it's issue preclusion, in a civil case for damages.

19
20

Could a -- could a -- a party use it in a

MS. PRELOGAR:

No.

Say, well, you

It wouldn't be

appropriate to rely on it there, because as a Federal --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

MS. PRELOGAR:

Why not?

-- civil collateral estoppel

23

principle, the verdict has to be final, and it would

24

lack finality if the conviction had been reversed.

25

I think that actually points up Petitioner's primary

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

argument here, which is to focus on what the conviction

2

necessarily established, and that's not actually the

3

correct focal point of this inquiry, because we're not

4

the ones trying to rely on the conviction to

5

collaterally estop Petitioners from doing anything.

6

Rather, they're the ones invoking collateral

7

estoppel, and they're relying on the acquittal to do so.

8

So the proper focal point of the inquiry here is what

9

did that acquittal actually decide?

And in light of the

10

inconsistency, we can't know that it resolved any issues

11

in the defendant's favor.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you don't know

13

based on the conviction.

14

verdicts are inconsistent.

15

same problem I was raising with your friend on the other

16

side.

17

to me that what we're being asked to decide, if the

18

possibility that they might be is enough to allow the

19

government to relitigate the substantive -- the

20

substantive count.

21

little bit of a -- an extension of what our precedents

22

have said.

23

You don't know that the
What you know -- it's the

What you know is they might be.

And so it seems

And it does seem to me that's a

MS. PRELOGAR:

We do know, though, that

24

these verdicts definitely were inconsistent.

25

just a possibility, because the jury was instructed on

Alderson Reporting Company

It's not

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

the same theories of liability for all of the counts

2

involving Section 666.

3

The First Circuit considered this issue --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

jury -- if the jury relied on the part of the

6

instruction that was legally invalid, then you don't

7

know that they reached a -- a verdict inconsistent with

8

what was the acquittal in the prior case.

9

MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, but if the

We can't rely --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MS. PRELOGAR:

A valid conviction.

That's true we can't rule out

12

that possibility, but it's equally possible that the

13

jury validly convicted on a quid pro quo bribery theory

14

and decided to acquit on the other offenses out of

15

lenity or mistake or confusion.

16

And when we're in this world where we just

17

don't know, and Petitioners concede that we can't be

18

certain what other verdict rested on, then in that

19

situation the -- the general collateral estoppel

20

principle is that they cannot preclude that issue from

21

further litigation.

22

there's a possibility that the jury resolved issues in

23

their favor.

24

did that.

25

Because it's not just whether

There has to be a certainty that the jury

And I think it's actually something notable

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

that it's not at all unusual for acquittals to lack

2

preclusive effect when there's some ambiguity about what

3

the jury had actually decided.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Blatt suggested that

5

there's something -- I think she used the word

6

"unseemly" -- about using a vacated conviction for this,

7

or indeed for any other purpose, given the traditions of

8

our legal system where it's just very hard to find

9

instances in which we have done so.

10

So, you know, I'm not sure I understand

11

where the unseemliness prohibition comes from, but it

12

does seem, you now, quite out of kilter with the

13

traditions of our legal system to use vacated

14

convictions in a manner that affects individuals'

15

constitutional rights.

16

shouldn't be concerned about that?

17

So, I guess, tell me why we

MS. PRELOGAR:

You shouldn't be concerned

18

about it because the tradition is limited to looking at

19

convictions to stand in for the defendant's guilt.

20

we acknowledged here that we are -- we can't rely on the

21

convictions to establish that.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

I think the tradition goes

23

further.

I mean, you have a tough time in your brief

24

coming up with any instances, and the only times you do

25

are -- are some -- a couple of scattered lower court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

decisions.

2

tough time coming up with any instances in which courts

3

have used vacated convictions for any purpose.

4

But you have, other than that, a really

MS. PRELOGAR:

Those lower court examples,

5

though, I think are particularly relevant, because what

6

a number of them are doing are using the vacated

7

conviction to answer precisely the question that we have

8

at issue here, which is to try to ascertain the basis

9

for a jury's other verdict.

10

And when the whole question is what did the

11

jury actually necessarily decide.

12

are quite obvious relevance in answering that question.

13

And in fact, it's -- it's also the case that the

14

conviction can be relevant to help the defendant, not

15

just harm the defendant, by actually clarifying the

16

basis of an accompanying verdict that might otherwise be

17

ambiguous.

18

The jury's verdicts

We cite a case that does this, the Velasquez

19

case from the Third Circuit.

The way that that

20

situation works is that if a defendant, for example, has

21

defended on multiple theories, let's say it's a

22

conspiracy case and he said there was no agreement and

23

no overt act, he won't be able to establish, in

24

acquittal, which basis the jury accepted in returning

25

that verdict.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

But if there's a separate conviction in the

2

case, maybe overlapping with the overt act, even if that

3

conviction is set aside, the defendant could point to it

4

and say this shows that the jury must have resolved the

5

agreement issue in my favor on that separate verdict of

6

acquittal.

7

So this isn't an argument that -- that

8

convictions are relevant only when they benefit the

9

government, or that we're able to use them to the

10

defendant's disadvantage.

11

nature of the inquiry.

12

looking at the question of -- of what that jury

13

necessarily decided, its verdicts are quite salient

14

relevance in answering that question.

15

It's an argument about the

And I think that when you're

Petitioners' primary argument is based on

16

Yeager.

17

court didn't consider the hung count, the same result

18

has to obtain here.

19

different because there, there wasn't a jury decision at

20

all through the hung count, and so there wasn't anything

21

that could actually create a true inconsistency with the

22

one verdict in that case that the jurors had returned,

23

the verdict of acquittal.

24
25

Petitioners contend that because there, the

But Yeager is fundamentally

I think Yeager is a manifestation of this
Court's long-standing presumption that jurors follow

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

their instructions, they're presumed to act rationally.

2

And Yeager ultimately concluded that the hung count was

3

just too thin of a reed to attribute irrationality to

4

the jury as a whole.

5

a whole in that hung count hadn't done anything.

6

hadn't agreed on anything.

7

Because by definition, the jury as
They

The verdicts are differently situated as

8

Yeager itself recognized.

Yeager distinguished Powell

9

and said that when you have inconsistent verdicts, there

10

the jury has spoken through its verdicts.

11

reached contradictory results, then what we know is that

12

that inconsistency exists as a matter of the record of

13

the case, and Powell says that in a situation presenting

14

that kind of inconsistency, it wouldn't be appropriate

15

to assume that the verdict of acquittal is the proper

16

verdict, the one that the jury really meant.

17

And if it

In fact, Powell said that the most obvious

18

explanation for that kind of inconsistency is that

19

jurors were convinced of guilt and decided to acquit out

20

of lenity.

21

And it would be particularly inappropriate,

22

I think, to accord preclusive effect to that kind of

23

verdict based on lenity, because it would essentially

24

magnify the effects of the jury's nullification and

25

extend it far beyond the compromise the jury itself

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

struck and affect other counts beyond what the jury ever

2

intended.

3

And so I think Powell rightly recognized

4

that when we're in a situation where we can't know that

5

the jury was following its instructions and applying a

6

lot of fact in a rational manner, then the defendant's

7

not able to carry the burden to show that the acquittal

8

is the verdict that -- that the jury truly meant and

9

intended to resolve the factual disputes in the case.

10

I think that we cite a number of examples as

11

well where it's clear that there are a number of

12

examples where there will be ambiguity in what an

13

acquittal resolved, even separate and apart from

14

inconsistent verdict.

15

that this fails to accord respect to verdicts I think is

16

out of sync with how general preclusion principles

17

operate.

18

And so petitioners' suggestion

Imagine again my conspiracy example where

19

the defendant offers two defenses and says there was no

20

agreement and no overt act.

21

jury acquits and we have a general verdict of acquittal,

22

we won't be able to ascertain the exact argument that

the jury adopted.

24

25

to identify which issue was resolved in the defendant's

favor provides a basis to avoid collateral estoppel.

2

And I think this is just a recognition that

3

collateral estoppel is something of an extraordinary

4

remedy here, and yet we need to be satisfied that its

5

most fundamental prerequisite is satisfied, that

6

something was actually resolved in the defendant's

7

favor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you agree with

Petitioner that if you have a jury finding, jury makes a

10

finding, but that finding is infected by race

11

discrimination, you can't use that for anything even

12

though it's a jury finding?

13

MS. PRELOGAR:

Certainly you can't use it to

14

establish that the jury found the defendant guilty,

15

because in that situation, that kind of error would

16

establish that the jury wasn't basing that conviction on

17

any relevant circumstance.

18

error itself results in apparent inconsistency in

19

verdicts and establishes that the -- what seems to be an

20

inconsistency was actually based on the error itself,

21

then, of course, collateral estoppel wouldn't apply

22

because that would restore our presumption that the jury

23

did act rationally and find facts in reaching its

24

verdict of acquittal.

25

And to the extent that that

But to the extent that the error doesn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

explain the inconsistency, doesn't resolve the verdicts,

2

then we'd still be in a world where, as Powell

3

recognized, we simply can't see that through the verdict

4

of acquittal the jury necessarily resolved facts in the

5

defendant's favor.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, does that position

7

extend to anything that affects the evidence in the

8

case, so that if any prosecution evidence is improperly

9

admitted or any defense evidence is improperly excluded,

10

the same would follow?

11

MS. PRELOGAR:

So long as it creates

12

reversible error, then, of course, the conviction would

13

have to be set aside based on that evidence.

14

assuming that the evidence applied across the board --

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But

I thought your answer to

16

Justice Ginsburg was that if there was a particular kind

17

of error that resulted in the reversal, then the

18

conviction could not be used to show inconsistency in

19

the verdicts.

20

Did I misunderstand your answer?

21

MS. PRELOGAR:

22
23

No, I apologize.

Let me try

to clarify.
I was trying to distinguish between those

24

errors that are actually confined to the count of

25

conviction and those errors that would apply across the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

board to all counts.

So if there's a particular error

2

in the case, say an instructional error that only

3

affects the count of conviction, then that might

4

actually resolve the apparent inconsistency, because if

5

the jury received two different instructions on the

6

overlapping charges, then we might think by looking at

7

the instructions that we can actually clear up the

8

inconsistency that would otherwise exist.

9

extent, that type of error could resolve the

So to that

10

inconsistency and provide that the predicate for

11

collateral estoppel is satisfied.

12

But putting aside that class of errors, and

13

we're not in that world here, then I don't think the

14

type of error at all affects the analysis, because so

15

long as it's disconnected from the inconsistency itself,

16

then it doesn't do anything to clarify what that jury,

17

that we know must have disregarded its instructions,

18

what that jury was doing.

19

And I think that there's actually -- the

20

sole reason that Petitioners say that the Court should

21

disregard the inconsistency here is because of the legal

22

error in this case.

23

But it bears emphasis that they have a

24

remedy for that legal error.

The remedy is a new trial.

25

It's the ordinary remedy in this circumstance, and,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

Justice Ginsburg, in your hypothetical, there too, the

2

defendant would be entitled to a new trial.

3

But what petitioners are attempting to do in

4

this case is actually gain complete immunity from

5

further prosecution on these charges.

6

extend the effects of the acquittal on those independent

7

counts to this situation and prevent retrial of the very

8

count that the jury itself convicted them on.

9

are not entitled to that much greater remedy unless they

10

They want to

And they

can satisfy the prerequisites for collateral estoppel.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that is the greater

12

remedy that Yeager gave, and I understand your

13

distinction between Yeager and this case, but it does

14

leave you with a fundamental anomaly, which is, in a

15

case in which there's an acquittal and a hung count, the

16

acquittal is the only thing that matters.

17

where there's an acquittal and a vacated conviction, you

18

know, where a court has said this has got to be -- this

19

has got to be reversed and it no longer exists, in that

20

case the person comes up with a far less good situation.

21

MS. PRELOGAR:

And in a case

But that result makes sense

22

in light of the way Yeager reasoned through the issue in

23

the case, because in Yeager you could look to the

24

acquittal and identify that it must have made factual

25

finding --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It makes sense in terms of

2

parts of Yeager's reasoning, but not in terms of other

3

parts of Yeager's reasoning.

4

Another part of Yeager's reasoning just said

5

hung counts have never been accorded respect as a matter

6

of law or history.

7

convictions have never been accorded respect as a matter

8

of law or history.

9

nullities.

10

And similarly, one could say vacated

They are vacated.

They are

You don't get respect for that.
MS. PRELOGAR:

I understand that portion of

11

Yeager, though to just simply confirm what the Court had

12

already said, which is that hung counts are evidence of

13

nothing because they don't represent jury decisions at

14

all.

15

only through its verdict.

16

just disagreement or a failure to agree or even

17

extraneous --

A jury doesn't speak through its -- a jury speaks

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so something that signals

Well, I guess I see -- when

19

I read Yeager, I see two different rationales, and on

20

one you're exactly right.

21

with this case.

22

There's a real distinction

On the other, seems you're exactly wrong.

23

There's no distinction in this case at all because both

24

have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or

25

history.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

MS. PRELOGAR:

But I think that Yeager

2

itself signaled that the issue on which the case turned

3

is that we didn't have the kind of true inconsistency

4

that existed in a case like Powell, and the finality of

5

the conviction, its validity doesn't erase the

6

inconsistency that existed in Powell or provide any

7

greater clue about what that jury was actually thinking

8

and what it actually decided through its verdicts.

9

And so I think Yeager itself emphasized that

10

although we do have these finality concerns, a verdict

11

of acquittal is final only with those issues that it

12

actually decided, and Yeager was able to conclude that

13

the jury in that case, through the acquittal, did decide

14

issues in the defendant's favor as opposed to, for

15

example, deciding to acquit out of compassion, exercise

16

lenity, or neglect to follow instructions through the

17

count of acquittal.

18

That's not the case here where we have

19

conclusive evidence.

20

follow its instructions, and that brings the case in

21

line with Powell, notwithstanding the fact that the

22

convictions had to be vacated for unrelated reasons.

23

We know for sure this jury didn't

I think it's -- it's important to emphasize

24

too the weighty interests that land on the side of

25

retrial in this circumstance.

Thus, the ordinary remedy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

here and it's for good reason, because when there's a

2

legal error in a trial, that doesn't signal that the

3

government necessarily failed to prove its case and

4

there's still a strong societal interest in ensuring

5

that the government has an opportunity to enforce the

6

criminal laws against that person, and if it can prove

7

its case under proper instructions, obtain a guilty

8

verdict to punish the criminal misconduct.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

The question on which we

10

granted review refers to a vacated unconstitutional

11

conviction.

12
13
14

But is that what we have here?

Is this an

unconstitutional conviction?
MS. PRELOGAR:

I think that we -- that the

15

conviction, if it were based on proper theory, would not

16

be unconstitutional, and so we don't necessarily know.

17

That was the reason why the conviction had to be

18

vacated, was because it wasn't clear what basis the jury

19

had resolved the verdict on.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it was an erroneous

21

instruction, so it was instructional error.

22

constitutional error?

23

MS. PRELOGAR:

Is that a

It's a -- I think it rises to

24

the level of a constitutional error insofar as the First

25

Circuit held that the defendants -- that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

instructional error would have permitted criminal

2

conviction based on conduct that doesn't constitute a

3

crime, putting, of course, to one side, as Justice

4

Ginsburg noted, the circuit split on that issue.

It's

5

by no means an issue that's been fully resolved.

And

6

the majority of circuits have found that the gratuity

7

theory that the jury was instructed on here is a proper

8

interpretation of Section 666.

9
10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Sorry.

Is every

instructional error a constitutional error?

11

MS. PRELOGAR:

I don't think that all of

12

them would necessarily rise to the level of a

13

constitutional error.

14

is prejudicial and where we can't know for certain

15

whether the defendant was properly convicted based on

16

that charge, I think at the very least would of course

17

warrant setting aside the conviction and vacating it.

18
19

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if there were a harmless

error issue in this case, what would the standard be?

20
21

I guess any error that ultimately

MS. PRELOGAR:

If there were a harmless

error --

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

It would have to be harmless

23

beyond a reasonable doubt because it's a constitutional

24

error?

25

MS. PRELOGAR:

I'm not sure whether the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

lower court applied a Chapman standard here, and I think

2

ultimately the potential difference in standards

3

wouldn't have affected the analysis, because the court

4

concluded that there was -- that there was sufficient

5

evidence on the proper quid pro quo theory, also

6

evidence that would have supported a bribery theory.

7

And so the court just couldn't tell either way on what

8

ground the jury would have possibly grounded this

9

verdict.

10

Ultimately, though, I think in light of that

11

error, the appropriate result is the ordinary remedy

12

here, a retrial.

13

that remedy if they can carry their burden, and it's a

14

stringent one, of showing that the jury actually

15

resolved issues in their favor in this litigation.

16

They haven't carried that burden here.

Petitioners are only entitled to avoid

They

17

seek to be excused from it based on the legal error.

18

But they haven't actually carried the error -- carried

19

the burden of showing that that jury that returned those

20

inconsistent verdicts necessarily thought they were not

21

guilty of committing quid pro quo bribery.

22

Unless the court has further questions, we'd

23

respectfully ask that you affirm the judgment of the

24

First Circuit.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4
5

MS. BLATT:

Thanks.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

6

Justice Alito, any instructional error that

7

allows a jury to convict on something that's not a crime

8

violates the due process clause, but not all

9

instructional errors violate the due process clause.

I

10

wouldn't want to be convicted for something that wasn't

11

a crime.

12

So I don't -- that doesn't surprise me.
I'm going to start sort of backwards.

13

Justice Ginsburg, on your question about an all-white

14

jury where blacks are excluded, I'd go back and look at

15

the transcript, because she said, oh, well, that

16

might -- that might resolve the inconsistency.

17

And there's a real discomfort that she had

18

there, because she didn't want to say, well, they

19

acquitted him of murder, but because they also convicted

20

him of murder, maybe it was because they were -- they

21

were all white.

22

It's -- it's the same argument here, is --

23

she's saying, well, maybe that did cause the

24

inconsistency.

25

And it's our same argument too.

Alderson Reporting Company

Nobody

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

knows if the inconsistency is because they were

2

irreconcilably divided on whether he was not guilty of a

3

crime, or maybe it was purely a result of the

4

instructional error.

5

And it's because Yeager said it's

6

impossible, we could never meet that burden, and neither

7

could that -- the poor African American in her example,

8

he could never show that burden either, which is why the

9

burden shouldn't be on us.

10

Justice Kagan, your bit about unseemliness,

I'll take unseemliness.

unconstitutional under the due process clause, it's a

13

legal nullity under the double jeopardy clause.

14

even though we're not letting the government use it to

15

prove our conviction, I mean, our guilt or innocence,

16

it's just that if we otherwise had a double jeopardy

17

right because we were found not guilty, they can negate

it and take it away.
