ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. LANDAU:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

Section 1425(a) of the Federal Criminal Code

12

authorizes the government to strip a naturalized

13

American of citizenship if it was procured contrary to

14

law.

15

"procured contrary to law" require a causal link between

16

the procurement of citizenship and the underlying

17

violation of law.

18

district court read such a causal link out of the

19

statute, instructing the jury that it could convict if

20

Petitioner obtained United States citizenship and

21

violated at least one law governing naturalization.

22

instructions didn't require the government to prove that

23

the underlying violation of law had any effect

24

whatsoever on the naturalization decision.

25

contrary --

Our position in this case is simple.

The words

At the government's urging, the

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Even -- even assuming I

2

bought your argument, that's a very broad statement, any

3

effect.

How about a natural tendency to effect?

4

MR. LANDAU:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, your Honor -Because you can never

6

predict what will actually happen in the end.

7

only talk about what might happen.

8
9

MR. LANDAU:

You can

And we would be happy -- what

we asked for was a materiality standard, which I think

10

is very much along the lines, as Your Honor, just

11

suggested.

12

what makes this case so extreme, we're really at one end

13

of the spectrum.

14

instructed the jury, and here I quote, "Even if you find

15

that a false statement did not influence the decision to

16

approve the defendant's naturalization, the government

17

need only prove that one of the defendant's statements

18

was false."

19

What -- what's amazing here, and I think

The district court specifically

23

it's subjectively immaterial, but it might have a causal

24

connection at the end of the day.

25

MR. LANDAU:

You can

Well, the government, if it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

wants to strip an American of citizenship, which is

2

about the most grave thing it can do, probably short of

3

taking away someone's --

4
5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I fully -- I fully

understand that.

6

MR. LANDAU:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.
But the idea of what's

8

material and what's immaterial, and -- and what's a

9

causal link and what is not in a sense can be understood

10

and analyzed only after the fact.

11

MR. LANDAU:

Well, I think, Your Honor, the

12

government has the burden -- if it wants to show that

13

the Petitioner or the defendant procured citizenship

14

contrary to law, the government has to show, at the very

15

least, that, based on a false statement, that the false

16

statement was material.

17

Our basic submission --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you explain why this

25

atrocities.

Under what circumstances would that be
immaterial?

3

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, we would like a

4

chance to argue the materiality question to a jury,

5

which is the general decider of what is material under

6

this Court's decision in Gaudin.

7

the chance, given prevailing Sixth Circuit law, which

8

said there was no materiality to contest this issue at

9

trial.

10

We -- we did not have

What -- they were given refugee status based on

12

well-founded fear of persecution where and for what

13

reason?

14

MR. LANDAU:

Well, this is the crux of the

15

dispute, Your Honor.

16

it was based on the fear of persecution by the Serbs

17

based on her husband's evasion of military service.

The government's position was that

22

they're out of Bosnia.

23

in Belgrade seeking refugee status.

They're at the American Embassy

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. LANDAU:

Right.

And this was, in a sense, the

heart of the dispute at trial.

2

think, relates also to Justice Ginsburg's question --

3

the jury sent a note, but what was the refugee status

4

based on?

5

here a document that says that it was apparently based

6

on ethnic persecution by the Muslims in Bosnia.

7

think this is really the heart of the factual dispute on

MR. LANDAU:

No.

That's the -- that was the

13

hottest -- that was the -- that -- that's the key issue

14

that we would like to have an opportunity for our day in

15

court.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if -- I mean, if --

17

this isn't the issue that we -- that we took cert to

decide, but it does raise the question whether there's

this case is -- if you read the -- the naturalization --

let's read the refugee application, which is at Pet.

area.

This was a majority Muslim area within Bosnia.

10

It was a -- Bosnia was a patchwork of ethnicities at

11

this point.

12

and they had to flee Bosnia.

13

And they were in a majority Muslim area,

And I think this is really the crux of their

14

argument, that this is not -- that the -- the whole

15

issue about her husband's military service was really

16

not the basis for it.

17

the chance to argue this before a properly-instructed

18

jury.

19

that's the issue that we would like the opportunity for

20

our day in court on that issue, materiality, which is --

21

And this is what we would like

We may win or we may lose on that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean,

Can you explain to me how

22

the good moral character works into this, because even

23

if it's immaterial, it is a lie.

24

than one lie in this application.

25

MR. LANDAU:

And there was more

The -- the good moral character

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

provision, Your Honor, which is 1101(f)(6), 8 U.S.C

2

1106(f)(6), is our friend in this case, because you're

3

absolutely right.

4

But 1101(f)(6) does not make every lie preclusive of

5

good moral character.

6

of lie preclusive.

7

We have conceded that she told a lie.

It only makes a particular kind

There's a list of things that preclude good

8

moral character, and among them is a lie for the purpose

9

of obtaining an immigration benefit.

That was one of

10

the things that the government had to prove at trial.

11

And they charged her with that.

12

were convicted of that, that would preclude -- that

13

would disqualify her from naturalization, because you

14

cannot establish good moral character categorically if

15

you have told that lie for that purpose.

16

that underscores, Your Honor, that Congress did not

17

intend to make every lie on the form per se

18

disqualifying.

19

And if, in fact, she

But I think

To be sure, they may be relevant to good

20

moral character.

21

particular kind of lie preclusive of good moral

22

character in 1101(f)(6), it did so specifically.

23

and so the applicant has the burden under Section

24

1427(a)(3) of proving good moral character.

25

But where Congress wanted to make a

And --

And so, again, I think that section is our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

friend here because it shows the anomaly of the

2

government's position that basically any lie

3

automatically makes you liable under Section 1015.

4

Section 1015, under their view of -- of Section 1425 as

5

a pure look-through statute to 1015, sucks up any

6

violation of 1015(a), which, again, has no materiality

7

there for them, has no materiality in 1425(a), and --

8
9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, that's -- that's the

anomaly I'm stuck with, and maybe you can help me with,

10

Mr. Landau, is that 1425 doesn't contain an express

11

materiality provision.

12

clause, but not another.

1451 does, in one provision, one

13

MR. LANDAU:

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

15

It's

Right.
And then some of the

predicate acts for 1425 do and others don't.

16

MR. LANDAU:

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.
So it seems like,

18

linguistically, we have to do some somersaults to get

19

where you want to go, because no one would say that to

20

violate 1425, you have to prove, say, a material

21

genocide, right?

22
23
24
25

MR. LANDAU:

I couldn't agree with you more,

Your Honor.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

So we have to -- it

would be material -- not only would we have to add the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

word "material" to 1425 that isn't there, we'd have to

2

limit its impact to some predicate offenses and not

3

others.

4

MR. LANDAU:

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Your Honor, I -Statement-based ones, I

6

think your position is.

7

somersaults to add to a -- a statute, isn't it?

8
9

MR. LANDAU:
Your Honor.

That's a lot of linguistic

I -- I don't think so at all,

I think -- I think you have to look --

10

again, I think the contrast with civil denaturalization

11

provision, 8 U.S.C 1451(a) is a very powerful point in

12

our favor.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

How is that?

Because it

14

says illegally procure, and then it talks about material

15

misrepresentations in two separate clauses.

16

MR. LANDAU:

Correct.

And if -- if Your

17

Honor wanted to take a -- the most natural kind of

18

textual reading, you would say, okay, here in 1425, we

19

only have the general one, procured contrary to law.

20

the most natural, pure, textual approach would be to

21

say, well, then, that shouldn't cover statement offenses

22

at all, because statement offenses were broken out and

23

that would render the statement offenses in 1451(a) it

24

referenced --

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Suppose Fedorenko's

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

interpreted the language "procure," and doing it

2

illegally, is anything in the course of the

3

proceeding --

4

MR. LANDAU:

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

6
7

Well --- right?

So that's the

answer to that, isn't it?
MR. LANDAU:

No.

No.

But I think -- I

8

think the point is, Your Honor, we -- nobody is fighting

9

that -- that Section 1425(a) is broader than statements.

10
11
12
13

But I think what you can't do is -JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, then -- then, that

concession right there answers my problem, doesn't it?
MR. LANDAU:

I mean, it's -- I -- I might

14

have misspoken if I said -- 1425(a) includes -- it

15

includes bribery, it includes things to which the word

16

"material" wouldn't naturally apply, which I think

17

answers your question right there, in the sense that it

18

would have been nonsensical for Congress to put in a

19

general illegally-procured statute the word "material."

20

It just wouldn't fit there because it's a general one.

21

Where they use the word "material" in 1451,

22

that's because historically, 1451 has had illegally

23

procured, the kind of the catch-all, and a separate

24

statement one.

25

applies -- is a general catch-all, but when it's applied

But what you can't do is say 1425

to statements, they're not material.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

MR. LANDAU:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean --

Mr. Landau --

-- it just doesn't make sense.
-- hasn't the -- the

5

briefing in this case really clarified what the issue

6

is?

7

debated in the district court was the wrong issue about

8

whether to charge the jury on materiality, because

9

materiality is not in this statute.

And in a way, it seemed to me that what was being

But as you have

10

refined the argument, the issue is the meaning of the

11

term "procure" --

12

MR. LANDAU:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

That's absolutely --- which may or may not mean

exactly the same thing as "materiality."

15

MR. LANDAU:

I think you are absolutely

16

correct, Your Honor.

17

mean, it's the same issue we've been arguing all along.

18

I think you've put the point exactly right.

19

have a textual basis for what had been a line of circuit

20

court decisions going our way, starting in Puerta, that

21

went our way based on policy concerns, which are very

22

powerful, but really didn't grapple with the text of the

23

statute.

24
25

And that's one of the things -- I

I think we

And I think -JUSTICE ALITO:

Within your brief, you, I --

I think, have possibly tried to read more into "procure"

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

than you can, because in a number of spots you seem --

2

you argued that it means "but for causation."

3

morning you have said that's not your argument.

4

not -- you don't have to prove that, but for the -- the

5

false statement in the immigration proceeding, the

6

person would not have been naturalized.

7

MR. LANDAU:

Now, this
It's

Your Honor, our position in

8

this case was always relying on the line of circuit

9

precedent going our way was that it was materiality.

I

10

think if you didn't -- I mean, if we hadn't -- but for

11

the way this case evolved where it was really based on

12

materiality, I think there is a good argument that the

13

most natural reading of procure contrary to law, goes

14

back to the general causation principles in our law,

15

which as this Court underscored just last week in

16

Goodyear, is but-for causation.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I -- I don't know

18

whether you can get that out of "procured."

19

you this example.

20

ordinance that says that it is illegal to buy or sell a

21

scalp's ticket within 200 feet of the entrance of a

22

stadium or a concert hall, and I buy -- knowingly buy a

23

scalped ticket within 199 feet of the entrance of this

24

facility.

25

Let me give

Let's say there is a -- a municipal

Now, in order for me to have procured that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

ticket contrary to law, would it be necessary to prove

2

that I couldn't have purchased this from another scalper

3

around the other side who was outside of the 200 feet,

4

or I couldn't have gotten a ticket if I had waited in

5

line at the box office?

6

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, I think your

7

question points out some of the very difficult questions

8

of causation that -- that are really, you know,

9

implicated by the word "procure," and -- and on which

10

the Court, frankly, fractured in Kungys.

11

those are difficult questions that really haven't been

12

briefed before you.

13

really, at the very least, it has to be material.

14

you can't establish a causal link in this context, where

15

the statement doesn't even have the tendency.

16

And I think

I think our position here is
That

it really goes to qualifications for citizenship.

2

judge -- the -- my friends on the other side seem to

3

have a pretty watered-down version of materiality.

4

Well, that anything that might launch an investigation

5

is per se --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

MR. LANDAU:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

The

Can I ask you, Mr. Landau --

Sure.
-- about a -- a different

interpretation of the statute.

Neither you nor the

10

government supports it, but it's raised briefly in the

11

government's -- in footnote 4 of the government's brief,

12

which is this idea that what we really should be doing

13

here is we should be interpreting 1425 in exactly the

14

same way that we interpret the civil statute, 1451,

15

which talks about illegally procuring something.

16

MR. LANDAU:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.
And that both are limited to

18

failures to satisfy the prerequisites to naturalization.

19

And that's really what we should be thinking about when

20

we interpret that.

21

MR. LANDAU:

I think that that -- you know,

22

I think that makes a lot of sense, that -- that this is

23

really -- that's what it's about.

24

somebody of their citizenship.

25

natural question is, were they qualified for the

citizenship in the first place.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I found footnote 4 --

And that would, in this

3

case, presumably, be because of bad character; is that

4

right?

5

MR. LANDAU:

Well, I mean, no, the -- well,

6

the government, I think, thinks a lot more than that.

7

mean, they did not -- they tried to prove, but again, we

8

have a general verdict, so we don't know whether they

9

proved, that her lie was for the subjective purpose of

10

obtaining an immigration benefit.

11

could try to prove -- that if they did prove that, we

12

would agree she would not be qualified.

13

no question that there's a causal link there if you

14

could say the person wouldn't have been qualified.

15

I'm --

you under our case law under Ginsberg and Ness, and that

line of cases --

19

MR. LANDAU:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
-- that the government

21

relies on.

22

citizenship, one of the -- their argument is that a

23

prerequisite is not telling a falsehood, an intentional

24

falsehood in your application.

25

If it's a prerequisite to getting

MR. LANDAU:

But so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how do you win, and

2

how do you get causation into that?

3

MR. LANDAU:

But that is -- that is what I

4

was trying to get at before with 1101(f)(6), which goes

5

to the things that categorically preclude a finding of

6

good moral character, does not say any falsehood in the

7

application process is enough to disqualify you.

8

says, any falsehood for the purpose of obtaining a

natural -- an immigration benefit.

10

It

If they prove that -- then I think this goes

11

back to Justice Kagan's question -- they would prove

that we were disqualified.

cases is very consistent with footnote 4.

you're right and there is a materiality requirement that

says you should have an opportunity to present that to a

jury.

20

argue this is immaterial -- it is immaterial, these lies

were immaterial?

4

there was -- this was, in a sense, the issue -- I think

5

the jury note on Pet. App. 90, really nicely points out

6

that the jury in this very case asked the judge a

question, what was her refugee status based on?

based on fear of persecution by the Muslims, on ethnic

throwing roses in our path on remand.

deny that this could be a very tough row to hoe on

criminal conviction to strip her of her citizenship

There's nothing -- you can come up with a

chart that goes from 1015(a), which they say has no

materiality, to 1425(a), which they say adds nothing, is

a pure look-through statute, and leads to the direct

2

consequence of denaturalization.

3

any lie leads -- can lead to automatic denaturalization.

4

Congress could have come up with that regime, but it

5

didn't, because I think Congress recognizes that not all

6

lies are created equal.

7

and sizes.

8

one kind of lie particularly significant, it did so in

9

1101(f)(6) by saying it has to be a lie for the purpose

So under their view,

They come in different shapes

And that's why when Congress wanted to make

10

11

lie, they are golden, then they actually -- then they

12

win.

13

If they prove that

The problem is, in this case, my client

14

could have been convicted without that finding.

15

don't know that.

16

problem is here, the government's fundamental conception

17

of 1425(a) is wrong.

18

basically, as nothing more than a sentence enhancer for

19

the underlying convictions.

20

provision of the criminal code, with its own distinct

21

statute of limitations and its own very distinct

22

23

24

you can go to prison for up to 25 years, plus automatic

25

denaturalization, which flows as a result of 1451(e).

Alderson Reporting Company

So 14 -- you know, the -- the -- the essence

2

of that 14 -- that distinct 1425(a) crime is the

3

unlawful procurement.

4

predicate act and you're using it to procure

5

citizenship.

6

You're taking the unlawful

And so our basic position is if the

7

government wants to strip you of citizenship, on the

8

ground that you were not qualified for citizenship that

9

was procured contrary to law, it's very important for

10

them to show that you would have been qualified if the

11

-- would have been disqualified if the truth had been

12

known.

13

And going back to your point, Justice Kagan,

14

just to round out on footnote 4.

15

incomprehensible because the government basically starts

16

out with talking about a standard we actually like,

17

which is the disqualification standard for -- for

18

causation, essentially.

19

well, that would have been met here.

20

they can say, is that could have been met here, and, you

21

know, they can't possibly prove that, as a matter of

22

law, that -- that this was the contested issue at trial.

23

So we're okay with the legal standard there, but the

24

inference they draw in the next sentence, I think they

25

used the wrong verb tense.

I found that footnote

But then they go on to say,
I think the most

That -- that -- that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

particular footnote, I think, if you focus on that, that

2

can answer the case in a sense.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But failing to meet the

4

qualifications for naturalization sounds to me like

5

but-for causation.

6

MR. LANDAU:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

is it something less than but-for?
MR. LANDAU:

Well --

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. LANDAU:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

I mean, you can say it

should be but-for but I -- I'll win if it's anything.

12

14

So is that your argument, or

Right.
What is your -- do you have

a firm position or -MR. LANDAU:

We -- if we were starting this

16

on tabula rasa and we had not argued materiality below,

17

I would say that it's but-for.

18

interpretation of the statutes.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think that is the best

Well, that's -- I mean,

20

that's awfully hard, because then you have to go back

21

and determine, even if somebody says something that has

22

a real potential to affect the naturalization decision,

23

you still would have to go back and show that in this

24

case it actually did make the difference.

25

MR. LANDAU:

And, Your Honor, this was the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

crux of the debate in the plurality opinion in Kungys

2

between Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens.

3

mean, that's a very interesting debate.

And, I

4

But, actually, in the majority part of

5

Kungys in part 2(a) the majority there, the Court,

6

speaking through Justice Scalia, defined materiality, I

7

think in a way that is pretty darn close to but-for.

8

said -- it -- it's not quite there, but it said:

9

natural tendency to produce the conclusion that the

10

It

A

applicant was qualified for citizenship.

11

So, again, I think the real crux here is not

that's what this whole thing is about.

I -- I looked at -- on the naturalization form, there is

a question.

It's Number 22.

"Have you ever" -- and

-- "committed,

15

assisted in committing, or attempted to commit a crime

16

or offense for which you were not arrested?"

those sorts of offenses.

10

saying that on this form, you expect everyone to list

11

every time in which they drove over the speed limit --

12

MR. PARKER:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

No.
-- except when they

were arrested.

15

MR. PARKER:

Well, what I think the -- what

16

I think that particular question demonstrates is -- and

17

I will readily acknowledge, number one, that is a very

18

broad question, and, number two, and I think that there

19

is a great deal of ambiguity in what exactly is meant by

20

"crime and offense."

21
22

And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
it's worse.

If you look in Black's --

23

(Laughter.)

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Well, but just --

Dictionary, I looked up what's an offense?

So you really are

5

looking for the listing of every time somebody drove

over the speed limit.

MR. PARKER:

But here's -- here's what I

8

think is important, though:

9

to denaturalize someone, at least under Section 1425,

What you would have to show

10

would be that, number one, they were aware that that is

what the question was asking for --

13

MR. PARKER:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. PARKER:

I knew

--

-- they knew --

Right.

-- I drove over 55.

You are aware that that

16

happened.

17

question would require you to disclose that.

18

notwithstanding the fact that you had taken an oath to

19

truthfully answer that question, you chose to

20

deliberately lie.

could be proved beyond a reasonable doubt -- and that's

think what the -- what that question is requesting are

MR. PARKER:

There are a number of answers

21

that could be given in the naturalization process that

22

could be false and might seem to be, in isolation,

23

immaterial, completely immaterial, for example.

24

you could, you know, lie about your weight, let's say.

The point, though, is, Congress has

in these types of proceedings.

5

provided that it is a crime to lie under oath in the

6

lies are categorical bars to naturalization.

Can I just ask you -- can I ask you to take

14

Only -- only under oath.

you through a few parts of your brief?

15

MR. PARKER:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

Yeah.

Uh-huh.
Because I guess I felt a

little bit confused on reading what your standard is.

18

MR. PARKER:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.
So on page 14, you say that

20

the question is whether Petitioner violated the law in

21

the course of procuring naturalization, in the course of

22

procuring naturalization.

23

you say that the question is whether a person procures

24

naturalization in a manner that violates very -- that

25

violates other laws.

Then on page 9 and page 17,

Which are we talking about?

Is it in the

course of or in a manner that violates other laws?

MR. PARKER:

Well, I -- I -- my -- my

apologies if that wasn't clear.

5

saying two ways of saying exactly the same thing, and

6

that is exactly how the jury was instructed in this

7

case.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:
of different to me.

I think we're just

Yeah.

I mean, it seems sort

"In the course of" is what creates

10

the hypotheticals that Justice Breyer was talking about,

11

about the penknife or the gun or something like that.

12

MR. PARKER:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.
But what -- so what you're

14

saying -- but we -- you -- I can just choose, you -- you

15

can tell me, your standard is in a manner that violates

16

other laws.

17

MR. PARKER:

Well, I think that's right.

18

And I think what that means is the same as what the --

19

the jury was instructed in this case.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

It has to be --

So then -- I mean, it

21

makes me want to say, okay, what does it mean to procure

22

naturalization in the manner that violates other laws.

23

And then you talk about that.

24

on -- this -- the -- this is the only time I found in

25

the brief where you actually suggest what it means to

And you talk about that

procure naturalization in a way that -- in a manner that

2

violates other laws.

3

means is by violating those various laws.

4

those various laws.

5

causal requirement.

And you say on page 18, what that
By violating

And that made me think that's a

6

MR. PARKER:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.

I mean, what --

You procure

8

naturalization -- this is, again, on page 18 -- a person

9

who knowingly procures naturalization in an unlawful

10

manner, and then you clarify that that means by

11

violating the laws Congress has enacted.

12

say that you procure naturalization by violating laws

13

Congress has enacted, all you're saying is that -- is

14

that the naturalization results from the violation of

15

those laws.

16

MR. PARKER:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So when you

Well, I -And I guess if that's not

18

what you meant to say -- and I don't mean to trick you

19

here --

20

MR. PARKER:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- if that's not what you

Right.

22

meant to say in this brief, although it suggests --

23

it -- it -- I think it is what you say, but if it's not

24

what you meant to say, well, how could it be anything

25

else?

MR. PARKER:

Well, I -- I think it is not.

2

And my apologies if that sentence is unclear.

3

it's actually described in -- in more detail on the

4

preceding page, on page 17.

5

of that provision is that it means that you have to

6

procure naturalization in violation of the laws that

7

govern the naturalization process.

8

address naturalization and --

9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think

Our -- our interpretation

These are laws that

Well, number one, where is

that in the statute?

11

MR. PARKER:

Well, I think that it is a

necessary construction of the -- of the phrase, "procure

But -- but that's a different issue from the
one I'm talking about.

MR. PARKER:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.
Whatever laws it is, whether

22

it's all laws or whether it's laws relating to the

23

naturalization process.

24

MR. PARKER:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.
When you describe what you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

mean when you say in a manner that violates the laws,

2

it's when you say, you say it's by -- you -- you procure

3

naturalization by violating the laws, you very

4

naturally -- I think it's a totally naturally --

5

natural --

6

MR. PARKER:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.
-- construction of the

8

language, you very naturally say you got the

9

naturalization by violating those laws, meaning that the

10

naturalization is the result of those -- that violation.

11

Because what else could you mean when you say -- when

12

you -- when you have a naturalization and you have these

13

violation of laws?

14

MR. PARKER:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

led to the naturalization.

17

MR. PARKER:

Well, again -Again, that the violation

Well, again, I mean, just with

18

respect to the sentence that you're quoting, I think

19

what we were -- what we were saying is by violating the

20

laws, we were trying to describe what it means to act in

21

an unlawful manner.

22

that that means procurement of naturalization.

23

I don't think we were trying to say

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I know.

I'm sort of

24

suggesting that in trying to describe that you ended up

25

using the Petitioner's formulation, and that seems quite

Alderson Reporting Company

natural to me because I don't know what other

2

formulation you could use --

3

MR. PARKER:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

Well, I don't think --- to describe what it means

and say in a manner that violates those laws.

MR. PARKER:

I don't think that it is

says procure contrary to law naturalization.

12

I think that law has to be interpreted consistent with

13

the -- the two words that bookend that provision,

14

"procure" and "naturalization."

And then the phrase is "contrary to

Well, the question then is contrary to what laws?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

Can I -- can I ask you

this --

18

MR. PARKER:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
This may be a

20

simpleminded question, but how can an immaterial

21

statement procure naturalization?

22

MR. PARKER:

I think that the -- the -That's such a shorter
It's perfect.

(Laughter.)

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

MR. PARKER:

I think the answer is, we at

2

least don't read the statute to require that the

3

statement be procuring the naturalization.

4

read the statute to say that the violation has to

5

procure, and I think that this goes to a difference in

6

how we may be using the term "materiality" here.

7

We don't

The Petitioner is saying that it means that

8

the person has to have lied about a material matter,

9

meaning that a truthful answer would be more likely to

10

get them naturalization than an untruthful one.

11

Petitioner has also said several times, that it would be

12

the but-for cause of getting that naturalization.

Or, as

13

But what Congress was concerned here with is

14

not what people lied about; rather, it was the fact that

15

they lied.

16
17

And the lie itself -JUSTICE ALITO:

That's the same question.

It may be the same question in a -- in a different form.

18

Just give me a sentence that has this

19

pattern.

21

procured had no potential -- I'm sorry -- where the

thing that she did had no potential to help her get X.

Jane Doe procured something.

MR. PARKER:

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

Jane Doe

Had no -- well -She -- she procured X

contrary to law, but the thing that she did had no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43

potential to help her get that thing.

2

MR. PARKER:

If -- if what we are saying,

3

as -- as Petitioner has argued, is that it has to be

4

something that -- where you either could not get it, or

5

it would be much less likely to get it if you did Y

6

instead of X, I think one example might be, you know,

7

painting that's in the gallery in one of two ways.

9

You can procure the
You

10

procure it lawfully by buying it.

11

entirely natural to say that you have procured the

12

painting contrary to law, even though, presuming that

13

you had the money, you could just as easily have

14

purchased it.

15

If you steal it, it's

And that, I think, is the difference.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the -- the thing -- the

16

thing that was done there, stealing the painting

17

certainly had the potential to help the thief get the

18

painting.

19

MR. PARKER:

That's true.

It was the means

20

by which they walked away with the painting.

21

don't think that it is -- that there was any causal

22

relationship there of the sort that we've been talking

23

about.

24
25

would you accept; that is, you've heard two right there.

From your point of view,

affect a reasonable immigration officer in his judgment?

That's tougher

than you're usually accepting.

It had the possibility or tendency to influence the

5

are capable of any interpretation that suggests any kind

6

of tendency of the unlawful act to move an immigration

7

judge -- if not this one, some other one -- towards a

8

plus decision.

9

But the question, of course,
And we have some

So I want to know if those words, in your mind,

MR. PARKER:

I -- I don't think so, because

10

Congress has said, for example, that even -- and -- and

11

this was the Court's decision in Kungys -- that even an

12

immaterial false statement about the most immaterial of

13

matters can be a categorical bar to the abilities --

14

ability of the person to be naturalized.

15

And the -- the point there is that it would

16

be very odd, I think, to read the statute to say that if

17

a person procures naturalization despite having done

18

that, that somehow that was not done contrary to law

19

because materiality or some -- some other formulation

20

would be required in addition in order to establish

21

that.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Parker, let me --

23

let me try this another way.

24

which is a kind of a stilted phrase, because the

25

"contrary to law" comes in between.

If you take this phrase,

Alderson Reporting Company

But -- but it --

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

all it really means is procure naturalization illegally.

2

Do you agree with that?

3

MR. PARKER:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

Procure contrary to law and

naturalization, it's procure naturalization --

6
7

I think so.

MR. PARKER:

Yes, if you violated laws

governing naturalization, right.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So the idea that procuring

9

naturalization illegally somehow includes illegal acts

10

that have no effect on naturalization, or on procuring

11

naturalization, it's -- it's just not how we use

12

language.

13

How could it be that that is true?

14

MR. PARKER:

But it's not.

Well, my

15

disagreement there is that it is not that it has no

16

effect.

17

lied.

The effect, though, is the fact that the person
It is not what the person lied about.

18
19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it has -- but it has no

effect on the decision to naturalize.

20

MR. PARKER:

Whether a truthful answer would

21

have had an effect on the decision to naturalize versus

22

an untruthful one?

23

quite clearly that that is not the relevant

24

consideration for purposes of these --

25

statutes.

I -- I think that Congress has said

Alderson Reporting Company

applying these

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

And I guess what I'm

2

saying is that, how do you use that phrase in a statute

3

and not mean that there has to be a relationship between

4

the illegal acts and the procurement of naturalization?

5

MR. PARKER:

6

to be a relationship.

7

just don't --

Well, I think there does have

I -- we don't dispute that.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

MR. PARKER:

10

Will you tell us --

-- think that there is a causal

nexus.

11
12

We

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Will you tell us what that

relationship is?

13

MR. PARKER:

That -- that relationship, in

14

our view, is that the laws have to be the laws governing

15

naturalization.

16

governing who may be naturalized and there are laws

17

governing how they must do so.

18

And what that means is there are laws

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

If that's true, though,

19

Mr. Parker, what do you do with 15 -- 1425(b)?

20

the difference between (a) and (b) on the government's

21

account?

22

naturalization; (b) says you procure naturalization

23

you're not entitled to.

24

MR. PARKER:

25

What's

(a) says you -- you procure contrary to law,

Well, I think that the

reference to being entitled in subsection (b) reinforces

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

our point that "contrary to law" doesn't necessarily

2

mean that you weren't entitled to the naturalization.

3

It means that you violated the rules that Congress had

4

set forth governing who can be naturalized and how they

5

must do to.

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So (b) would be you

7

were -- you were not entitled to begin with, and (a) is

8

you may have been entitled, but you lied in the process

9

of.

10

MR. PARKER:

I think that's a fair reading.

11

I mean, I would note that -- that (b) also sweeps more

12

broadly than (a), because it includes things like

13

obtaining a certificate of naturalization rather than

14

the actual procurement of naturalization.

15

I think --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. PARKER:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Parker --

Yes.
The government -- the

Congress doesn't have the power to denaturalize someone.

At least so far we haven't let them do that as

21

punishment for a criminal act.

22

MR. PARKER:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Uh-huh.
So how -- go back to

24

Justice Kagan's question about footnote 4 in your brief,

25

and your adversary's position that if it's a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

prerequisite to naturalization -- that's what this

2

means -- that that's the only time Congress can deprive

3

you of citizenship is when something actually would have

4

barred you from getting it.

11

MR. PARKER:

Well, the only point that we

were trying to make in that footnote -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know the point you

were trying to make -MR. PARKER:

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- but answer the point

he has made --

12

MR. PARKER:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.

Well --- and the point I have

14

made, which is, if Congress doesn't have the power, ex

15

post facto, to denaturalize you, we're giving them this

16

power, should we be reading it narrowly or broadly?

17

MR. PARKER:

Well, I don't think that there

18

is -- I think that it shouldn't necessarily be read

19

broadly, but I think that any fair reading of the

20

statute would include this.

21

what we think about eligibility because, frankly, I

22

think that it may be a way to get to the same point.

And let me just explain

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

MR. PARKER:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I --

Yes.
-- ask you before that,

we've been concentrating on this statute.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in

I think

Justice Sotomayor has a question pending.

11

MR. PARKER:

Yes.

So let me just explain

12

for a moment how eligibility would work in this context.

13

Let's say that somebody makes a false statement in their

14

naturalization process, and that false statement is

15

discovered.

16

false statement is of the sort that is mentioned in

17

Section 1101(f)(6), and therefore, is a categorical bar

18

to naturalization.

19

ineligible.

20

One of two things will happen.

Either the

You are immediately deemed

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is -- is that the false

21

statement for the purpose of obtaining an immigration

22

benefit?

23
24
25

MR. PARKER:

Yes.

And it can be an

immaterial one, yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

MR. PARKER:

2

If it is not that, let's say it's a -- it's

3

a violation of Section 1015, but it didn't involve oral

4

testimony, and in -- in Kungys, this Court held that --

5

that 1101(f)(6) requires oral testimony.

6

happens is it would have to be analyzed under the

7

residual provision of 1101(f), which says, the fact that

8

we have enumerated certain grounds above does not mean

9

that those are exclusive, and there are other grounds on

10
11

So that would be one.

Then what

which the person's good moral character may be denied.
What happens at that point is, either the

12

person could be denied because they are actually

13

ineligible based on that statement, or they could be

14

denied naturalization because, at every stage, the alien

15

bears the burden of persuasion, and it could be

16

concluded that they did not satisfy their burden of

17

establishing eligibility.

18

to obtain naturalization, notwithstanding having made a

19

false statement, is do what -- what the regulations

20

refer to as demonstrating extenuating circumstances.

What they have to do in order

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. PARKER:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

MR. PARKER:

25

Demonstrating --

This is a whole -- I'm sorry?
Demonstrating what?

Extenuating circumstances.

So

this would be a whole record evaluation by the agency of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52

all of the circumstances involved, and the alien bears

2

the burden of doing that.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In which of those

4

processes has there ever been the kind of immaterial

5

statement that the Chief Justice gave, lying about a

6

traffic ticket, where there's been no injury to anybody

7

and no claim of reckless driving, other than the

8

speeding?

9

MR. PARKER:

10

Uh-huh.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Where has the agency

11

ever denied naturalization because of an -- an

12

immaterial statement?

13

MR. PARKER:

I'm not aware of a particular

14

case in which that has occurred.

15

published decisions, so I -- I couldn't say.

16

would note, however, that if the alien -- if that lie is

17

not discovered, and the alien manages to procure

18

naturalization notwithstanding it, the government's

19

position would be that at that point, that person has

20

procured naturalization in a circumstance in which they

21

are not eligible, because as a factual matter, they had

22

lied.

23

incumbent upon them to show extenuating circumstances.

24

They did not do that, and so they would be ineligible.

25

I would also like to note, though, that --

These are not

JUSTICE BREYER:

Your interpretation on that

2

interpretation, and on your interpretation of 1425, and

3

the words that say in 1451, "shall be deprived of his

4

citizenship."

5

interpretation would raise a pretty serious

6

constitutional question, wouldn't it?

Given the seriousness of that, your

7

MR. PARKER:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

I don't think so.
It's not a serious

constitutional question of whether an American citizen

10

can be -- have his citizenship taken away because 40

11

years before, he did not deliberately put on paper what

12

his nickname was or what -- or what his speeding record

13

was 30 years before that, which was, in fact, totally

14

immaterial.

15

That's not a constitutional question?
MR. PARKER:

Well, I -- I don't think so,

16

because Congress has, number one, specified that

17

immaterial false statements are grounds for denying

18

naturalization.

19

there are a few responses.

limitations, so it wouldn't be 40.

you're -- that you're entitled to citizenship, you can

be renaturalized.

You then have to wait 5 years, and if after

5

It also doesn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't think this

6

is problem of -- of a constitutional statute, but it is

7

certainly a problem of prosecutorial abuse.

8

the position that refusing to -- not answering about the

9

speeding ticket or the nickname is enough to subject

10

that person to denaturalization, the government will

11

have the opportunity to denaturalize anyone they want,

12

because everybody is going to have a situation where

13

they didn't put in something like that -- or at least

14

most people.

15

If you take

And then the government can decide, we are

16

going to denaturalize you for other reasons than what

17

might appear on your naturalization form, or we're not.

18

And that to me is -- is troublesome to give that

19

extraordinary power, which, essentially, is unlimited

20

power, at least in most cases, to the government.

21

MR. PARKER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

Well, I -That strikes me as

a serious problem.
MR. PARKER:

I certainly understand your

concern, Mr. Chief Justice.

All I can say is I -- I

don't think that the statute says anything that would

necessarily prevent denaturalization from occurring --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. PARKER:

5

But it --

-- but there are a number of

other --

It -- it seems to me that

your argument is demeaning the -- the priceless value of

citizenship.

That's not what our

That's not what citizenship means.

11

MR. PARKER:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I would -You're arguing for the

13

government of the United States, talking about what

14

citizenship is and ought to mean.

15

MR. PARKER:

Right.

And I -- well, we would

16

readily agree that it is a priceless treasure.

17

not disputing that at all.

18

the priceless nature of citizenship, is that Congress

19

has surrounded it with a number of protections to ensure

20

that the individuals seeking it square every corner and

21

are absolutely and completely honest.

22

We are

One of the consequences of

I do want to point out, though, that there

23

are a number of other protections built into the system,

24

that would prevent this sort of problems that the Chief

25

Justice has raised; and one of those is that we would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that -- that

this was a deliberate lie.

a unanimous jury of that, is very difficult.

thing about the character of this statute.

12

here for denaturalization, the parallel civil way to get

13

a person denaturalized --

14

MR. PARKER:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- I ask you one other

-- and a criminal.

In

16

other cases where there are parallel criminal penalties,

17

civil penalties, is there any other one where the

criminal disqualifications is easier to establish than

19

the civil one?

20

MR. PARKER:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MR. PARKER:

May I?
Sure.

I -- we would say no, because

23

we believe that the language "illegally procured" in the

24

civil provision is effectively synonymous with

25

procurement contrary to law.

It would only be that in

Alderson Reporting Company

the criminal provision, you have to satisfy the statute

2

of limitations and the beyond a reasonable doubt

standard and the mens rea requirement.

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. LANDAU:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'd like to make three quick points, if I

11

might.

12

that he asked both sides about the relationship between

13

1425(a) and (b), I think they are largely overlapping.

14

It is true that the -- the -- (b) covers some more

15

things that (a) doesn't cover; (b) uses the language

16

"entitled."

17

First, to go back to Justice Gorsuch's questions

That may inform exactly the nature of the

18

causal link that one would infer in (a), but I think it

19

doesn't in any way affect our central argument here,

20

which is there has to be some causal link that it's

21

absolutely -- you cannot procure something contrary to

22

law, based on an immaterial false statement, which, by

23

definition, is the kind of thing that doesn't even have

24

the tendency to do that.

25

Again, to go back to Kungys, the natural

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

58
1

tendency to produce the conclusion that the applicant

2

was qualified for citizenship.

3

Second, the -- the government said a number

4

of times, oh, yeah, this -- it's not a big deal.

5

you know, the government under Kungys, it said you don't

6

need material false statement.

7

Wells also, that -- in response to another statute where

8

that was true.

9

We --

And -- and it said in

In both Wells and Kungys -- and we make this

10

point in the 1015 section of our brief -- the -- the

11

Court made the point of addressing the concerns that

12

taking out materiality would open up the defendant to an

13

incredible array of sanctions based on something that --

14

you know, presumably, Congress doesn't mean to

15

criminalize minor offenses.

16

purpose requirement in both of those, and that's what

17

gave the Court comfort in saying you didn't need

18

materiality in addition to that purpose requirement.

19

So it is not true when the government is

But it said:

There is a

20

saying, oh, immaterial false statements are a basis for

21

denaturalization under 1101(f)(6).

22

as Kungys stressed -- because there is already a

23

for-the-purpose-of requirement in that same provision.

24
25

That is only -- and

And the same exact thing is true on -- in
Wells, which is based on Kungys.

The government has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

identified no case in the history of American law where

2

this Court has upheld a statute without a materiality

3

requirement if there wasn't some functional equivalent

4

to materiality, such as a purpose requirement.

5

think some of the hypotheticals that were posed here

6

show just how drastic this would be, and how extreme the

7

government's position is here.

8
9

And I

The third and final point I'd like to make,
is that I think, as some of Justice Kagan's questions

10

pointed out, the most natural way to read "procured

11

contrary to law," is to have it mean procured by means

12

of a violation of law.

13

phrase that modifies the way in which you procure it.

Contrary to law is an adverbial

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. LANDAU:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you --

If you -Do you read Wells as

17

having a causal requirement -- as being a causal

18

requirement.

19

MR. LANDAU:

20

basically says for the purpose of --

21

I think it's -- it's -- it

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the speaker knows the

22

falsity of what he says and intends to influence the

23

institution.

24
25

MR. LANDAU:

Correct.

I think that

that's -- basically, that's why I think it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

60
1

functionally the equivalent of materiality.

2

the Court felt some comfort in Wells.

3

just say, oh, we -- we -- we are fine with -- you know,

4

we are dispensing with de minimis non curat lex.

5

is the background norm against which all of our laws are

6

enacted, because we have to assume that this -- the --

7

the government -- you have to look at how the harshest

8

prosecutor in the land will apply this.

9

questioning today makes it chillingly clear that the

10

government's position in this case would subject all

11

naturalized Americans to potential denaturalization at

12

the hands of an aggressive prosecutor.

13

So I think

The Court didn't

That

And I think the

That is not what Congress intended.

That is

14

not what is in the language of the statute.

15

the statute compels this Court, that -- this would be

16

breaking entirely new ground, and we urge this Court no

17

to go there.

Nothing in

18

Thank you very much.
