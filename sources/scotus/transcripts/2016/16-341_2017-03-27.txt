ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. DABNEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Court in this case is presented with an

12

historic choice.

13

destroying venue protections that Congress provided in

14

28 U.S.C. 1400(b), and that this Court interpreting that

15

statute declared to exist in its Fourco Glass decision.

16

And the correct choice, we submit, is to adhere to this

17

Court's existing, long-established interpretation of

18

Section 1400(b) and to reject the new call for a new

19

revisionist interpretation that would render Section

20

1400(b) nugatory in this case and in all but the most

21

unusual cases.

22

That choice is between upholding or

I'd like to open first with some undeniable

23

points.

24

about 1400(b) that control this case.

25

Court interpreted Section 1400(b) as a standalone.

In Fourco Glass, this Court made two holdings

Alderson Reporting Company

The first is this
It's

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

the sole and exclusive provision governing venue in

2

patent cases and is not to be supplemented with Section

3

1391.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How can that be when in

5

Brunette we said that 1391 governed aliens, the

6

definition of aliens?

7

couldn't have meant.

8
9

So that broad statement we

MR. DABNEY:

What the Court held in Brunette

was that venue legislation had, since the beginning of

10

the Republic, been extended only to United States

11

domestic persons and that the then-existing 1391(d) of

12

Title 28 was not a venue rule at all, but rather was a

13

codification of a principle that dated back to 1789 that

14

aliens were simply outside the scope of all venued laws.

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do we do with

unincorporated associations?
MR. DABNEY:

What we do

with unincorporated -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Those are -- those are

not defined by 1400.
MR. DABNEY:

Well, 1400(b) in Fourco was

22

held to apply to all defendants.

23

which this Court held in Fourco that 1400(b) was

24

standalone, precisely because its predecessor had

25

applied to any person, corporation, or partnership.

That was one ground on

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

there was never any practical issue interpreting 1400(b)

2

as in litigation involving limited partnerships and even

3

unincorporated nonperson associations, because the

4

linchpin of 1400(b) and its predecessor was domicile.

5

When you have a venue rule that keys to

6

domicile and specifically distinguishes between a

7

domiciliary and a non-domiciliary, then the problems

8

that the Denver and Rio Grande case addressed and that

9

Respondent brings up as hypothetical problems simply

10

didn't exist.

11

It's noteworthy that in -- in the

12

Respondent's brief, they don't cite a single real world

13

example where there was any problem interpreting and

14

applying Section 1400(b) ever since the Sperry v.

15

American --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. DABNEY:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there --

-- Railroad case.
Is there any other

19

provision, venue provision in which a venue for a

20

corporation is only the place of incorporation?

21

MR. DABNEY:

22

is only the place of incorporation.

23

here, Your Honor, and identify -- it could very well be

24

that there is one, and that's a very good reason why

25

when Congress amended 1391 in 2011, they put that broad

Where venue for a corporation

Alderson Reporting Company

I cannot stand

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exception language in.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, don't you

3

suppose -- even for diversity purposes, a corporation

4

is -- is diverse based on not simply its place of

5

incorporation, but its principal place of business.

6

Principal place of business counts.

7

under 1400.

8
9

MR. DABNEY:

It doesn't count

Well, since 1948, that has been

the general rule that 1391(c) has provided.

1391(c) has

10

said for 60-odd years that a corporation, regardless of

11

its domicile, will be deemed to be resident in this

12

district, that district, that district.

13

been a feature of general venue law since 1948.

14

whole point here is that -- that rule was urged upon

15

this Court.

16

considered statutory language that was not materially

17

different in this respect from current 1391 and held

18

that 1400(b) when it says the judicial district where

19

the defendant resides, that means domicile.

20

where --

21

And that has

In the Fourco Glass case, the Court

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

in Fourco, it was not based on any statute.

23

based on the common law:

24

domiciled?
MR. DABNEY:

That means

Again, whatever it said

25

The

It was

Where is the corporation

Well, I would respectfully

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disagree with that.

2

was a statutory term, and it had a very well-established

3

meaning at the time of the statute's enactment.

4

this Court held one of the specific issues in this case

5

is, did the word "resides" in -- in 1400(b) signal a

6

change from the word "whereof he is an inhabitant" in

7

Section 48 of the 1911 judicial code.

8

held those words were synonymous.

9

and there can only be one of those.

The word "resides" in the statute

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

MR. DABNEY:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

And

And this Court

It meant domicile,
There's only --

What do --

-- one domicile.
What do you think Congress

would have to do to reverse our decision in Fourco?

14

MR. DABNEY:

Well, there are many ways that

15

it could be done.

16

Institute proposed that Section 1400(b) be repealed.

17
18

And -- and in 2001, the American Law

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is there any way Congress

could do it without repealing 1400?

19

Is there any change that Congress could make

20

to 1391 that would have that effect.

21

MR. DABNEY:

I could imagine that if instead

22

of saying "except as otherwise provided by law," the

23

statute said "notwithstanding any other provision of

24

law, this would govern."

25

that.

That would be a way to do

But --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That -- that would do it?

2

In other words, your argument in the end rests on that

3

"except" provision?

4

MR. DABNEY:

It rests importantly on the

5

"except" provision.

6

case an easier case than Fourco Glass was because at the

7

time of Fourco Glass, all you had was the general venue

8

statute and the very specific tailored, historic venue

9

statute that had been dating back to 1897.

The "except" provision makes this

And so in

10

that case, the Court used the standard tools of

11

statutory construction and said, you know, the specific

12

statute is not going to be swallowed up and rendered

13

nugatory by the more general, and it applied the kind of

14

reasoning that the Radzanower case did.

15

Touche Ross is a very, very analogous case to this.

16

Radzanower v.

But now that Congress has specifically

17

provided not that 1391 overrides 1400(b), but that 1391

18

yields, is subordinate to other statutes and common law

19

that -- that provide otherwise for venue, that makes

20

this case just easy to apply.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- but Congress also

22

said in 1391(c) that it was defining residency for all

23

venue places -- all venue purposes.

24

MR. DABNEY:

25

venue purposes.

And the prior statute said for

So, yes, the word "all" was added.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

Respondent has not identified any venue purpose that was

2

not covered by the original version of 1391(c) that now

3

is covered by 1391(c).

4

What we never had before 2011 was a statute

5

that subordinated 1391(c) to other venue provisions.

6

And we encourage the Court to read pages 31 and 32 of

7

Respondent's brief, because you don't get up until -- it

8

isn't until you get to page 31 that Respondent can even

9

bring itself to address the exception clause, which is

10

so clearly fatal to their position.

11

means all means all means all for the first 30 pages.

12

And then finally we get to page 30 and 31, and what do

13

they say?

14

The "except" language has nothing to do -- this is on

15

page 32 -- the "except" language in Section 1391(a) has

16

nothing to do with the definition in 1391(c); quote,

17

"Those definitions do not govern venue," unquote.

18

They talk about all

Well, they say, well, the "except" language.

Well, that directly contradicts what they

19

say on page 8 of their brief, which states, quote, "The

20

new -- Section 1391(c) now governs for all venue

21

purposes."

22

So the plain meaning of "govern" applies to

23

1391(c) by their own characterization.

24

who are saying that 1391(c) governs venue in this case,

25

which is what they say on page 8, and then they try to

Alderson Reporting Company

They're the ones

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

do this acrobatic maneuver to escape the exceptions

2

clause by saying it doesn't govern.

3

our reply brief, the plain meaning of "govern" means

4

that 1391(c) is part of the sections that in the

5

structure of 1391 is subordinated to the exception

6

language.

7

Well, as we say in

So the -- the Court doesn't need to do

8

anything here except say that Fourco's interpretation of

9

1400(b), which under Kimble v. Marvel and statutory

10

precedence of this Court, it is as much a part of that

11

statute as the words originally were, that that is part

12

of the law that everyone agrees provides for a venue

13

otherwise than what the Respondent is arguing for.

14

The Respondent is arguing that 1400(b)

15

should now be given an artificial meaning imported from

16

1391(c).

17

made in the Fourco case.

18

Fourco was a -- a West Virginia corporation who was

19

alleged to reside in the Southern District of New York

20

when it didn't actually reside, because the argument

21

was, it's deemed fictitiously to reside in New York

22

under 1391.

23

1400(b), which distinguishes between resident and

24

nonresident defendants, you can't import that synthetic,

25

fictitious definition of "resides" without destroying

That is the exact argument that the Respondent
The -- the Petitioner in

And the Court said, in the context of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

both the text of the statute and completely defeating

2

its purpose.

3

1400(b) was enacted to restrict where patent

4

cases could be filed, and what we've seen in the Federal

5

search that's experiment since 1990 is a very good

6

demonstration of why patent cases need a venue statute

7

like 1400.

8

Section 1400, you get the kind of litigation experiences

9

that are set out in the amici briefs.

10

If you don't have a venue statute like

The -- the law professor's brief noted that

11

there's a single judge in the United States that has

12

one-quarter of all patent cases in the United States on

13

his docket.

14

nothing more than upholding the venue protection that

15

Congress provided and that this Court announced in

16

Fourco, and that Congress took a very careful look at in

17

2011, and decided to --

18

This is a situation that cries out for

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Dabney, I mean, one

19

oddity of this case is -- is usually, when we say

20

something, when we issue a decision, we can be pretty

21

confident that Congress is acting against the backdrop

22

of that -- that decision.

23

be an odd thing to say in this case, given that for 30

24

years the Federal Circuit has been ignoring our decision

25

and the law has effectively been otherwise.

But I think that that would

Alderson Reporting Company

And then

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

the question is, well, what is the backdrop against

2

which Congress is legislating.

3

It seems actually that if -- if I were a

4

congressman, I'd think that the practical backdrop

5

against which I'm legislating is not Fourco; it is

6

instead the Federal Circuit's decision in VE Holding,

7

which is the decision that the practice has conformed

8

to.

9

MR. DABNEY:

Well, I -- I can tell the Court

10

from someone who does practice that not everyone ever

11

acceded to VE Holding.

12

actually happened in the 2011 act, it seems to me that,

13

in 2011, Congress took steps that indicated that they

14

didn't get the memo, that this Court's decision in

15

Fourco Glass was a nullity and that -- and that its

16

disregard by lower courts had somehow become the law of

17

the land.

And I think, if you look at what

18

First, VE Holding, the 1990 decision of the

19

Federal Circuit, had seized upon a prepositional phrase

20

in a 1988 version under this chapter.

21

was thinking, oh, what I want to do is lock in a

22

situation in which an enormous, extreme controversial

23

imbalance in Federal patent litigation that goes to a

24

very small number of victics, it was an odd thing for

25

Congress to have repealed the very grab-hold that --

Alderson Reporting Company

So if Congress

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

that the Federal Circuit had seized on to justify its

2

results.

3

So I would argue that the legislation that

4

Congress passed, far from ratifying that holding, very

5

intentionally abrogated it.

6

September, three months before the 2011 act was passed,

7

Congress amended the America Invents Act to provide for

8

a new restriction on what could be deemed a regular and

9

established place of business under 1400(b).

Not only that, in

Section

10

18(c) of the AIA says that an automated teller machine,

11

an ATM, shall not be deemed a regular and established

12

place of business.

13

say that that -- that provision was not inserted at the

14

behest of New York money center banks; that -- that

15

provision was put in at the behest of individuals who

16

didn't even form an LLC or a corporation so that they

17

would enjoy the protection alone.

Now, I suppose the Respondent would

Well, let me respond in -- in

17

two ways.

18

point of view, the relevance of litigation behaviors in

Section 1400(b) was a wise statute that Congress passed

21

and that it should be upheld.

But I really feel I need an answer

MR. DABNEY:

13

Learned Hand dealt with the hardest of all situations of

14

what do we do with an unincorporated association that

15

isn't an entity.

16

that had no entity status at all, and Judge Learned Hand

17

in that case held -- which had been a rule applied

across the board in patent cases without problem -- that

But to -- to reiterate, the statute has

No other place.

9

11

Well, where does this

No, no.

What -- what law

do we look at to see where an LLC resides?
MR. DABNEY:

Under this Court's precedence,

13

the Court has looked to State law to determine where the

14

residence of a juristic person created by a State is

15

located, and so --

16
17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose the State would

say we count the principal place of business as well.
MR. DABNEY:

It -- well, some states might

19

do that, but the States always require that the domicile

20

to be in the State.

21

So in this case -- in this case it's a very

22

straightforward case because the -- the -- the public

23

office, that is, its legal domicile under Indiana law,

24

is in Indianapolis.

25

is an Indiana domicile question under any -- under --

But -- but it is an Indiana -- it

So unless there is some fictitious meaning

4

easy case.

5

has no offices in Delaware, it has no regular

6

established place of business in Delaware, and there's

7

really not much more to say about that.

8
9

There's -- there's -- the -- the Petitioner

There's -- there's one other point that I'd
like to bring up, and that is that 1400(b) was enacted

10

together with a Federal service of process statute found

11

today in 28 U.S. 6 -- U.S.C. 1694.

12

services of process in patent cases that are commenced

13

in a district where the defendant is not a resident, but

14

has a regular and established place of business.

15

there is another demonstration that, in this context,

16

"resident" means domicile, and Federal law specifically

17

provides for nationwide service of process on

18

nonresident defendants.

19

And it authorizes

And

So the key point I'd just like to leave you

20

with is, for more than 100 years, a patent venue has

21

been a function of the domicile of a defendant, and it

22

provides for an easy-to-administer, clear rule that

23

prescribes where venue is -- is permissive in a patent

24

case.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but for more than 30

Alderson Reporting Company

years the practice has been the other way.

2

I'm -- I'm -- I was thinking as I was reading the

3

briefs, sometimes we have accidental theme days at the

4

Supreme Court.

5

years of practice goes against you, what happens?

I mean,

So today's accidental theme is:

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. DABNEY:

When 30

I -- I -- I heard Justice

8

Souter say something like that in the KSR case, you

9

know, the teaching-suggestion-motivation test has been

10

around so long that, at some point, the mistake becomes

11

the law.

12

again stood up for its authority to declare what the law

13

is.

14

And -- and this Court has again and again and

On -- on issues of patent law, there's

15

actually a precedent, Andrews v. Hovey that says no

16

issue of patent law is settled until we have settled it.

17

In Dickenson v. Zurko, there's a tremendous

18

administrative law -- body of law that this Court said

19

the Federal Circuit was wrong in the way it --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, maybe the Federal

21

Circuit was wrong in not following Fourco, but the

22

question is now before us, and you are asking us to say

23

that venue in a patent infringement case is only where

24

the entity is incorporated or comparable to that, and

25

you have acknowledged that there is no other venue

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

provision for any other kind of claim that is so limited

2

to just the place of incorporation.

3

MR. DABNEY:

Well, I -- I would -- I would

4

respectfully disagree because what 1400(b) does is it

5

provides a different way to define venue for nonresident

6

defendants.

7

district where the defendant is domiciled.

8

provides not the expansive regime that 1391(c) does, you

9

know, anyplace where, you know, someone could

1400(b) isn't restricted just to the
1400(b)

10

constitutionally summon you into court.

11

you have to have a regular and established place of

12

business and commit an act of infringement.

13

1400(b) says

Now, that's the choice that Congress made.

14

That is a different venue prescription than what 1391(c)

15

provides.

16

here, and -- and as -- as someone who tries patent

17

cases, I could tell you, there's a reason why patent

18

litigation is -- has characteristics that make it much

19

more susceptible to the kind of forum shopping that some

20

of the amici have done because the injuries at issue in

21

patent litigations don't grow out of some tangible --

22

you know, a train wreck or some tangible loss where --

23

where it tends to bring the litigation to the place of

24

the injury.

25

And there is very good reasons.

I could sit

The injury claimed in patent litigation

usually is -- is a synthetic nonreceipt of a reasonable

2

royalty that allegedly is due, and -- and that can be

3

marketed and sold and transmitted into a forum.

4

all kinds of reasons why 1400(b) is an important law to

5

enforce and uphold.

7

There's

If there are no further questions, I'd like
to reserve the rest of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Thank you, counsel.

Well, I do, actually.

10

MR. DABNEY:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.
Not so fast.

Now, as long as you have a

14

minute, maybe you could indulge me and trace me through

15

this.

16

where the defendant resides.

With a corporation, I think 1400 says resides,

17

MR. DABNEY:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

Section 48.

20

an inhabitant.

Correct.
But then that incorporated

And Section 48 said where the defendant is

21

MR. DABNEY:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
And now "inhabitant," how

23

do we know that means where the incorporation is

24

incorporated or something?

What does that mean in the

Official - Subject to Final Review

22

"inhabitant" means what you think it means?

2

What do you think it means?

3

MR. DABNEY:

4

Because Fourco said that.

Fourco said --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And Fourco is going really

6

into whether 1391(c) or -- whether they made an

7

exception, whether they included that, and it says no.

8

It's a very short opinion.

9
10

MR. DABNEY:

1400(b) is the relevant part of

Fourco --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. DABNEY:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. DABNEY:

Yeah.

-- is on page 226 -Yeah.

-- where the Court says, by an

15

eight-to-one vote, characterizing the change from

16

Section 48, in the middle of the page, quoting the

17

revisor's notes, words in subsection (b), "where the

18

defendant resides" were substituted for "of which the

19

defendant is an inhabitant" because the words

20

"inhabitant" and "resident" as respects venue, are

21

synonymous.

22

And then there's this parenthetical, "We

23

pause here to observe that this treatment, and the

24

express reason for it, seems to negative any intention

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. JAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If I may, I'd like to offer a different

10

theme for today, and that would be definitions rather

11

than the 30-year point that Justice Kagan posited.

12

Congress has written a definition of

13

"residence" that applies for all venue purposes.

14

So

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but I mean --

15

yes, there's a difference between for venue purposes,

16

and for all venue purposes, and for venue under this

17

chapter, but this is something fairly significant in the

18

area of patent law.

19

Congress were trying to make a significant change,

20

there'd be a lot more evidence of it other than just

21

changing the particular nuances of -- of the words.

22

MR. JAY:

And I would have thought that if

Well, of course, Mr. Chief

23

Justice, it isn't here a change from "for venue

24

purposes" just to "for all venue purposes."

25

I think, four changes in between the Fourco text and the

Alderson Reporting Company

There are,

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

text today.

2

construed in VE Holdings which said "for purposes of

3

venue under this chapter."

4

And in between, you had the statute

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But there's no real

5

evidence of any -- including in the nuances you talk

6

about -- of such a significant change.

7

I mean, the -- we can't get -- we can't get

8

rid of this issue.

I mean, we tried in -- in Stonite

9

and then in Fourco.

It just sort of keeps coming up.

10

And -- and I would have thought, when you have -- well,

11

I mean, is our Fourco decision law?

12
13

MR. JAY:

Fourco -- the principles by which

Fourco interpret the statutes are still good law --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. JAY:

Well, then the --

-- but the definition that Fourco

16

applied is no longer the controlling definition of

17

"residence."

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Well, the

19

current statute says "except as otherwise provided by

20

law."

21

overturning the Fourco decision.

22

MR. JAY:

And I would have thought that excluded

So, I don't think so, Your Honor.

23

And I think that the function that "except as otherwise

24

provided by law," I'd like to illustrate what work that

25

is doing in the statute, and then I would like to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

explain why nothing, in fact, "otherwise provides by

2

law" in 1400(b).

3

So if you look at the appendix to the red

4

brief, pages 3A to 4A, and then again 5A to 6A, these

5

are the old statutes.

6

then it would actually be the '52 version.

7

know, from the '48 recodification.

8
9

So this is the '88 version and
And, you

"Except as otherwise provided by law" has
been in the statute since the '48 recodification.

Where

10

was it?

11

was in the diversity venue provision, (a) and (b) of

12

1391.

It was in the general venue provision, and it

So that's right in the carryover on --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that the end, and then

14

later it's going to be -- it's going to be moved to the

15

beginning.

16

MR. JAY:

That's right.

So now that there

17

is -- there aren't separate statutes anymore for general

18

venue, diversity venue, and local action venue, which

19

was 1392, all of that's now in 1391(b).

20

"except as otherwise provided by law" language, which

21

has always been there, has now been put in 1391(a).

22

if you look at why the American Law Institute drafted it

23

just that way, because it's just the way that the ALI

24

drafted it that Congress adopted, you will see that --

25

both from the ALI report and also from page 18 of the

Alderson Reporting Company

And this

And

otherwise provided by law language" is to, quote,

"follow current law."

4

VE Holding at all.

It wasn't intending to overrule

5

Now, my friend on the other side --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No -- but it wasn't

7

intended to overrule VE Holding, but I suspect it wasn't

8

intended to overrule Fourco at all either.

9

is a decision of this Court.

10

MR. JAY:

And Fourco

It certainly is, Your Honor.

But

11

I do think that Fourco is based on two things, and I --

12

those things are no longer the case in the statute.

13

me walk through that.

14

So Fourco is based on two things.

Let

Number

15

one, the fact that 1400 was recodified in the 1948

16

revision of the Judicial Code.

17

change specified in the revisor's notes, the Court said

18

it will not read that change in, even though,

19

ordinarily, when Congress makes a change in language,

20

this Court's presumption is the opposite.

21

presumption is that Congress means to do something by

22

its change, not in the recodification context.

23

don't have the recodification context anymore.

24
25

And if there isn't a

The Court's

Now we

The other thing is the specific and the
general canon.

This Court said that 1391(c), as it then

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

existed, was clearly a general corporation venue

2

statute, and so it was.

3

could be sued.

4

now a purely definitional provision, and it was adopted

5

specifically to clear up a number of the nagging

6

problems that the members of the Court have been asking

7

my friend about, including where do you sue an

8

artificial entity that is not a corporation?

9

it reside.

10

It provided where a corporation

It doesn't do that anymore.

1391(c) is

Where does

Justice Breyer, the answer to your question

11

is in this -- this Court's decision in Denver and Rio

12

13

general venue case.

14

that the Court said in that case, there is -- there was

15

no settled construction of the law on where an

16

unincorporated association resides in 1948, and there is

17

none yet.

18

Now, my friend says, well, that's a
But I think the salient point is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did you raise the

19

significance of the fact that it was an unincorporated

20

association in your brief in opposition?

21

MR. JAY:

No, Your Honor, because we don't

22

think that it matters because the definition now applies

23

to all business entities; corporations, and LLCs.

24

The --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

It seems odd to me

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

you didn't raise it in your brief in opposition, and yet

2

it takes up several pages in -- in your brief on the

3

merits.

4

MR. JAY:

Because it's relevant to our

5

statutory interpretation, that our interpretation, but

6

not the other side's, would clear up this issue and save

7

the Court from having to confront in another case where

8

does an LLC reside.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. JAY:

Why another case?

-- in another case -I mean, look -- look.

14

point, and that is that Fourco doesn't apply really to

15

unincorporated associations.

16

thing to do for us to decide the issue, if you win,

17

that's the end of it; and if you lose, you send it back

18

and we say to the lower court, if you haven't forfeited

19

the point, maybe you could raise it and argue it.

That's the

If you're wrong, then you have another

So why isn't the right

20

Is that the correct way to handle this?

21

MR. JAY:

22
23
24
25

Honor.

I think that that's fine, Your

I do think that -JUSTICE BREYER:

That's fine.

That's the

correct way to handle it?
MR. JAY:

Yes, simply because -- because we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

think, of course, that we win.

2

win --

3
4

JUSTICE BREYER:
win.

MR. JAY:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

10
11

Obviously, you think you

And -- and.

5

9

And one reason that we

Yes.
-- and --

Look.

worried about it if you win.

I -- I'm -- I'm not

What I'm worried about

what to do is if you lose.
MR. JAY:

Right.

And so I agree with what

12

Your Honor just said.

13

about what to do with LLCs and what to do with

14

defendants who don't reside in the United States -- this

15

goes to Justice Sotomayor's question -- is a big part of

16

why -- why the ALI working with the Judicial Conferences

17

Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction proposed a

18

statute that would resolve these ambiguities in the

19

naked word "resides" or "resident" --

20

But I -- but the -- the question

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I thought the ALI -- and

21

you -- you rely upon it in your briefs a lot and you

22

rely on it here.

23

1400, and Congress didn't do that.

24
25

I mean, the ALI wanted to get rid of

MR. JAY:

That's right.

But its -- its

proposal to clear up the ambiguities in the word

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

"resident" or "resides" for all venue purposes, the ALI

2

explained in its report at page 188 and 189, and then

3

Congress then, in the House Report at page 20, echoed it

4

almost exactly.

5

the work that the words "for all venue purposes" do is

6

to provide that these definitions shall apply not just

7

to the general venue statute, but to all venue statutes,

8

general or special.

9

thing on page 20, even though, of course, as you said,

The reason to -- the work that is --

And the House Report says the same

10

the House didn't repeal 1400.

11

14 --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And we're not saying that

In -- special or there are

13

lots of different ones.

14

this, don't worry about getting rid of 1400, because

15

this gets rid of it?

16

that at all?

17
18

MR. JAY:

21
22

I mean, did they say anything like

No.

Because 1400 still serves a

function.

19
20

But did it say, if you pass

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I mean, getting rid

of Fourco.
MR. JAY:

Oh.

Well, that's a different --

that's a different --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. JAY:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Did it say anything --

Well, but -- but -- but
I mean -- when I used to --

maybe this was years ago.

the Supreme Court's interpretation in Fourco.

4

anything like that.

5

This said, don't worry about

If you pass this, you will be rid of

MR. JAY:

Or

What it said, Your Honor, is that

6

the Federal Circuit's decision in VE Holding was it

7

called it a partial palliative.

8

needed to be finished, because VE Holding addressed

9

corporations based on the statute as it -- corporate

10

defendants, based on the statute as it then was, but

11

that the work needed to be carried forward in the

12

definition for, number one, corporate plaintiffs, where

13

do they reside; and, number two, unincorporated

14

defendants, where do they reside?

15

cross-cutting, all-purpose definition was intended to

16

do.

17

It said that the work

And that's what this

But for the -- I think it's important to

18

note that under our view, 1400(b) does do work.

19

the venue statute.

20

defendant reside -- all defendants reside there, or all

21

defendants are subject to suit there under the other --

22

under the second half.

23

general venue statute provides, which, for example, can

24

base venue on the residence of only one defendant.

25

There is significance; there is work left to be done for

It is

So you have to show either that the

That's different from what the

Alderson Reporting Company

1400(b).

2

But it doesn't define -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -- and -- because I

3

thought that the only thing that left was to govern a

4

suit against an individual.

5

MR. JAY:

Well, a suit against an individual

6

would still -- would be more likely to trigger the

7

second half of the statute.

8

proper venue, the first thing you do is you look at

9

which is the right venue statute?

But in deciding what is the

In this case, it's

10

not the general venue statute 1391(b); it is the special

11

venue statute for patent cases, 1400(b).

12

doesn't define "resides."

13

14

so for "all venue purposes," that's the definition you

15

apply.

Now, that

"Resides" is defined to "all

Now, when the defendant is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

(B) gets really subsumed by (a) -- 1400(b),

I'm sorry, Mr. Jay.

18

the second part of it, gets subsumed by 1391.

19

no -- you keep saying there's work for this, but I --

20

where?

21

MR. JAY:

There's

So the second half, I agree, does

22

not have much work left to do, except in cases where the

23

defendant's an individual.

24

by itself means that the second half is not surplusage.

considerations.

here on the merits.

to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, but I

think that the practical difficulties with the other

raise all of those in a brief in opposition in order for

you to consider why you should adopt our reading on the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Jay, can I just ask

4

you -- and this is a clarification question, and maybe I

5

should know this.

6

was the subject of Fourco.

But you have the original 1391, which

7

MR. JAY:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

amendment.

Uh-huh.
Then you have the 1988

Then you have the 2011 amendment?

10

MR. JAY:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Correct.
Is it the 2011 amendment

12

that you think changed things, or is it also the 1988

13

amendment?

14

which words do you think changed the thing?

15

And if it's the 2011 amendment, exactly

MR. JAY:

So it's both, Your Honor.

I don't

16

think you need to agree with me about the '88 amendment,

17

but we do think that for corporate defendants, it

18

changed in 1988.

19

defendants in 1988, because those weren't the words that

20

Congress used.

21

It did not change for noncorporate

In 2011, we think that there are four

22

things -- and I think these are the four differences

23

that I wanted to talk about with respect to Fourco.

24

think that "for all venue purposes" does the work

25

because that's what the ALI and the House Report told

Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

you in addition to their plain and unambiguous meaning.

2

We think that the definition --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So why is "for all purposes"

4

different from "for venue purposes" or "for purposes of

5

venue" under this chapter?

6

MR. JAY:

Why isn't it all the same?

Well, "for all venue purposes" is

7

broader consciously than "for purposes of venue" under

8

this chapter because there are more than 200 venue

9

statutes that are outside Chapter 87.

10

the ALI wanted to --

11
12

And Congress and

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, but 1400 was within the

chapter --

13

MR. JAY:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's right.
-- so the effect was exactly

15

the same, wasn't it?

16

MR. JAY:

17

longer just corporate defendants.

18

adds to the definition.

It provides for a domicile for

19

individual defendants.

It expands the (c)(2) definition

20

to cover other business entities besides corporations,

21

which wasn't done in the '88 amendment, and it provides

22

a rule that slightly tweaks what this Court said in

23

Brunette.

24

defendants who do not reside in the United States.

25

Now, my friends on the other side say,

It wasn't because now it's no
The 2011 amendment

It provides what the rule should be for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

essentially, aliens can be sued in any district.

2

that's what the prior statute said.

3

Congress wanted the law to be anymore.

4

the law to be that a defendant that does not reside in

5

the United States may be sued in any district.

6

And

But that's not what
Congress wanted

How do you decide if a defendant resides in

7

the United States?

8

those definitions tie together.

9

if Congress had wanted to dispense with -- dispense with

You apply (c)(1) and (c)(2).

All

And I think that if --

10

Brunette for patent cases and creates, you know, an

11

entirely different rule just for patent cases, I think

12

there, it would have said so.

13

adopt a cross-cutting definition.

14

Third point:

But instead, it wanted to

The definition of venue in

15

1390.

16

purpose is, you can look at the definition of the word

17

"venue."

18

venue statutes are excluded from that definition.

19

They're the ones that regulate the subject matter

20

jurisdiction of a court and say that, this court and

21

only this court -- you know, let's say the district

22

court for D.C. -- shall have jurisdiction to decide .

23

That's carved out of venue, but the patent venue statute

24

certainly is not carved out of venue.

25

We -- if there's any doubt about what a venue

And some statutes that might be considered

JUSTICE BREYER:

You asked me this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

question -- answer this.

2

area, comparatively speaking, so you need -- I need

3

enlightenment here.

4

I -- I'm not an expert in this

Think of A-1.

This section shall govern the

5

venue of all civil actions brought in district courts.

6

Okay.

7

govern, where the law provides otherwise?

8
9

So what's an example of one that it doesn't

MR. JAY:

A special venue statute that

provides that, instead of the -- so if you -- if you

10

turn the page to 2A, the -- here is the general venue

11

statute, venue in general.

12

that provides that the basis for venue should be, for

13

example, the plaintiff's residence instead of the

14

defendant's residence, that is an example of a special

15

venue statute --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. JAY:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

So in other words --

-- by law.
B doesn't apply because of

the words in A, except as otherwise provided by law.

20

MR. JAY:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. JAY:

23

So a special venue statute

That is exactly -Okay.

Why Congress put those words

into --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. JAY:

A.

-- general venue statutes in 1948

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

--

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. JAY:

4

Yeah.

-- and why they are still there

today.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So why, if it

6

governs B, does it not govern C?

7

otherwise provided by law you've just said, and I think

8

you are absolutely right as far as I understand it.

9

That those words govern B. They govern A and they govern

10

B, then why don't they govern C?

11

MR. JAY:

12

from swamping a special venue --

So their function is to prevent B

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. JAY:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

The words except as

That might be--

But so -So -- so -- I know, but B

is in a separate section.

17

MR. JAY:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

section, so why doesn't it govern that?

20

MR. JAY:

Yes.
And now C is the next

So, two reasons.

Number 1 -- I

21

think the reason that uses the word section is that

22

previously there were two general venue sections.

23

were in 1391 and there were more for local actions in

24

1392.

25

Some

One of the things that Congress did in 2011

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

was get rid of 1392, so that's why I think it wrote in

2

this section shall govern the venue.

3

mean to govern venue?

4

to provide, on which, bases venue shall lie.

5

Plaintiff's residence, defendant's residence,

6

personal -- principal place of business?

7

venue statutes that do each of those things.

8
9

Now, what does it

What it means to govern venue is

There are

1400(b) it is a special venue statute, and
it says defendant's residence or the conjunctive

10

definition in the second half.

11

provides -- this is what says look to 1400(b) and not to

12

the general venue statute in a patent infringement case.

13

So, this is what

Of course, in a -- in another patent case,

14

where it's the alleged infringer bringing a declaratory

15

judgment action, saying that I want a declaration I

16

don't infringe, that does go under the general venue

17

provision and there are lots of declaratory judgment

18

actions brought right now by the prospective defendants

19

that get to use the general venue provision.

20

to sue patent owners anywhere the patent owner is

21

subject to personal jurisdiction.

22

They get

And one virtue of our rule is that it

23

creates greater harmony between the sort of declaratory

24

judgment actions which are kind of -- where the

25

defendant races into the courthouse to sue first, and an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

infringement action brought by the patent owner under

2

1400(b).

3

So I -- I hope that I've -- that I've

4

answered your question about why this doesn't govern --

5

why this doesn't do the work.

6

answer, which I had promised to get back to the Chief

7

Justice on, is -- is about why nothing provides

8

otherwise by law in this case, even if you don't agree

9

with anything that I've said to this point, and that is

But another part of that

10

because Fourco interpreted the word residence in 1400(b)

11

and that's absolutely true.

12

meaning that it had in all the venue statutes in 1897.

13

Diversity venue, general venue, patent venue.

14

meant inhabitant, and inhabitant had -- it did have a

15

meaning to corporations.

16

individuals.

17

unincorporated associations, but we can -- we can come

18

back to that.

19

14 -- it gave it the same

It just

It did have a meaning for

It didn't have a settled meaning to

The point is that Congress has now

20

adopted -- and one thing that my friend said that I --

21

that I entirely agree with.

22

definition.

23

but it did so because it wanted to eliminate nice

24

distinctions about where in -- particular kinds of

25

business entities reside using the term as it was used

It is an artificial

It is an artifical definition of residence,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

in 1897, and it wanted to simplify the inquiry.

2

You are going to have to answer the personal

3

jurisdiction question in all of these cases anyway.

4

for corporate defendants, giving an additional venue

5

inquiry about whether they -- where they are doing

6

business or where they have a regular and established

7

place of business are additional complications layered

8

on top of that personal jurisdiction inquiry that you

9

are going to have to do anyway.

10

So

That's why Congress, in 1988, for general

11

venue, decided to make personal jurisdiction the

12

touchstone for venue as well for corporate defendants,

13

and why the ALI, working with the judicial conferences

14

committee, and then Congress, decided to expand that to

15

unincorporated associations for all venue purposes in

16

2011.

17

a patent specific rule, but it is the best rule and it's

18

the rule that Congress adopted.

19

It's simpler, it's crosscutting, it's not sort of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -So a lot of amici

20

discussions as to their reasons for why so many suits

21

are centered in this court in Texas, what is your

22

reason, why do you think that is true?

23

MR. JAY:

So I think that -- if I understand

24

your question is, why do people sue -- what are people

25

suing in this court in Texas or why are so many

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

people suing in this court in Texas.

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is it 1391 or is it

something else?

4

MR. JAY:

Well, it's only 1391 in the sense

5

that it -- it's a permissible choice, but I don't think

6

that -- that is an answer to the question of why they

7

choose that over all other permissible choices.

8
9

And I think if there are complaints about
the way things are handled in East Texas, and my client,

10

Kraft, has been a defendant in East Texas in patent

11

infringement cases as well.

12

they tend to be complaints that aren't venue style

13

complaints.

14

compared to where I am located.

15

complaints about how the cases are managed, how

16

discovery takes place, how motions practice is handled,

17

and so on.

18

would be valid even when venue is indisputably proper

19

over a Texas defendant.

20

be dealt with on their own terms rather than by letting

21

anybody not from Texas out of that district and leaving

22

everyone else still in the district with -- where the

23

practice is unchanged.

24
25

If there are complaints

In other words, it's an inconvenient forum
They tend to be

And those complaints, if they are valid,

They are problems that should

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
understand that answer.

I -- I didn't

You are saying the problems

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

would be there for Texas corporations that actually

2

reside in that district anyway.

3

that 25 percent of the nationwide cases are there?

4

MR. JAY:

So we shouldn't worry

I'm saying two things, Your Honor.

5

Number one, I think the complaints about East Texas

6

aren't really about overcrowding -- and I would like to

7

answer that as my second point.

8

are about the way that the cases are handled, you know,

9

whether there be, you know, one case or a thousand

10

But that -- rather they

cases.

11

Or -- and we talk about the overcrowding --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

allows a kind of forum shopping, right?

14

you -- let's go down to Texas where we can get the

15

benefit of a certain set of rules.

16

MR. JAY:

But the complaint is that it
That it --

I mean, I think that the same

17

criticism can be made of the rule that Congress adopted

18

for the general venue statute in 1988, or for that

19

matter, the fairly liberal rule that Congress adopted

20

for corporation in 1948, and patent cases, number one,

21

don't have the varying circuit law.

22

Federal court, appeals court; and number two, they don't

23

have choice of law problems, you know, so that you can

24

certainly have forum shopping problems under the general

25

venue provision quite easily as well.

Alderson Reporting Company

They have a single

I do think --

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The general -- generous

2

jury verdicts enter into this or is that something we

3

shouldn't think about?

4

MR. JAY:

So I -- I think that the empirics

-- you know, there is a battle in the amicus briefs

6

about that.

7

has said that the outcomes are not significantly

8

different in cases that go to trial.

9

position on that.

10

I mean, I think that at least one scholar

numbers ourselves.

11

We don't have a

We haven't crunched -- crunched the
But ultimately we think that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But certainly that might

12

be a perception by the -- by the -- by the bar who

13

brings -- by the -- those in the bar who bring these

14

suits.

15

MR. JAY:

It -- it might well be and I --

16

and it -- certainly that is -- that is the argument that

17

is being made to Congress, and I think that when

18

Congress is -- you know, takes up this issue as it has

19

already been asked to do and it's already been

20

considering at the committee level.

21

something that this Court doesn't have the ability to do

22

in this case, and that is to modulate venue in the -- in

23

a way that is not binary.

24

you only have two choices.

25

Congress can do

I mean, in this case you --

My friends on the other side say, reside for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

a corporate defendant just means the state of

2

incorporation, that is it.

3

create a definition that doesn't turn on the word

4

resides at all, I -- or that adds more choices that

5

could add principal place of business.

the plaintiff has done research on the invention that is

venue in the last 10 years that I've seen look anything

What Congress can do is

It can add where

Those are, in fact, what the proposals look

None of the legislative proposals about patent

10

like what the -- what my friend on the other side are

11

proposing.

12

Nobody likes the one place of residence

13

rule.

14

business and some plaintiff-centered venue, and that is

15

why the empirics say that if you adopt the rule that my

friends on the other side are proposing, you will shift

17

more than half of all cases from the district where they

18

now are into other districts.

19

20

reform, nonpracticing entity cases would largely move,

21

but operating company cases largely would not.

22

if you adopted Heartland's rule, operating company cases

23

would wind up shifting, and this gets back to my point,

24

Mr. Chief Justice, they would have to shift to places

25

like Delaware where lots of defendants are incorporated,

They all at least offer principal place of

Whereas, if Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Whereas,

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

and if everybody were incorporated in Delaware maybe

2

that would be okay, but because lots are incorporated in

3

Delaware and some are not, you have kind of a dual

4

problem.

5

You're going to have overcrowding in

6

Delaware and you're -- you're -- the cases that really

7

out to be in the same place, you won't be able to bring

8

in the same place.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Were any -- were any

10

of these policy considerations addressed by Congress

11

when it made the change you suggest it made in 2011?

12

MR. JAY:

The policy considerations about

13

patent -- about where patent venue ought to be?

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. JAY:

Yeah.

No, because it -- Congress decided

16

that it was going to -- for purposes of residence it was

17

going to adopt a single definition across the board.

18

But -- but --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I laugh slightly because

20

if -- if that is so clear what is this case doing here,

argument.

weren't they in Congress?

Why weren't they there saying we

MR. JAY:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. JAY:

9

You -- I

I -- I can --- until I get -- you can?

Well, sure.

Because I think --

because I think that the issue is not the definition of

10

residence.

11

different patent venue statute altogether?

12

something that Congress has been working on, trying to

13

come up with something more calibrated, so that, for

14

example, a research university would be able to bring

15

suit in its home district, because that's where it did

16

the invention; it's where the inventor's lab is and so

17

forth, you know, where they would want to be able to sue

18

a defendant in its own principal place of business, even

19

if it doesn't commit the relevant act of infringement

20

there.

21

The issue is how do we come up with a
And that is

And in particular, because, you know, the --

22

the second half of the patent venue statute was

23

interpreted in a way that requires everything to be

24

conjunctive; in other words, all defendants have to have

25

committed acts of infringement and have regular and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

established places of business there.

2

subsidiary problems.

3

multiple patents, patents which are infringed at

4

different times, like the process of making something,

5

and then the good that is made.

6

different acts of infringement.

7

You have parent

You have problems when you sue on

Each of those could be

And you also have problems in pharmaceutical

8

cases.

9

working pretty well is these pharmaceutical cases where

I think one aspect of patent litigation that is

10

a brand company sues all the generic companies that want

11

to make a product that's a -- you know, a facsimile of

12

the brand product.

13

Congress, in Section 299 of the Patent Act,

14

recognized that those are an example of cases that

15

really all ought to proceed in the same district.

16

are an exception from the No Consolidation Rule that

17

Congress wrote in the America Invents Act.

18

They

So what's going to happen to those cases?

19

Number one, there is no act of infringement yet because

20

the -- or act of infringement that kicks off the lawsuit

21

is an artificial one.

22

to sue all those generics in the same district at all.

23

Right now, a dozen, or even two dozen, cases can all be

24

brought in the same district.

25

a judgment in 30 months, which is the time -- time

And number two, you won't be able

It has to be litigated to

Official - Subject to Final Review

51

period that Congress put in the statute.

2

if you were going to have to be bringing a dozen suits

3

in a dozen districts, that's going to be significantly

4

more difficult.

5

And yet, if --

Ultimately, we don't think that these

6

practical problems are dispositive, because we think the

7

text and the legislative history, and the reasons why

8

the ALI wanted to solve the problems that had come up

9

with the previous versions of the undefined term

10

"residents" are so clear.

11

definition that would have cut -- cut across all these

12

statutes.

Congress wanted a single

13

That might have been --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then why did -- why did

15

Congress reject the ALI proposal to just get rid of

16

1400(b)?

17

MR. JAY:

Well, I can't cite you a page of

18

legislative history, for example, but I think it may

19

well have wanted to continue having a rule that, for

20

example, requires all defendants to reside in the

21

district of venue, which is what 1400(b) now -- now

22

provides.

23

transactional venue, it allows for venue where nobody

24

resides, and it also allows for venue sometimes where

25

only one defendant resides.

Whereas the general venue provision has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

But we think that Congress could have gone

2

through and snipped out all of the venue provisions, or

3

portions of venue provisions that were left somewhat

4

superfluous by its adoption of this broad definition of

5

"resides."

6

task, but nevertheless, Congress decided to do it

7

anyway, and to do it this relatively easy way.

8

think, you know, the Fila venue --

9

The ALI recognizes that would be a mammoth

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I

It seems to me your answer

10

is quite proper as to 1400(a), but how does your answer

11

apply to 1400(b)?

12
13
14

MR. JAY:

How does it apply in terms of work

left to be done by the rest of the statute?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yeah.

You -- you -- your

15

explanation was that they -- they wanted to get rid of

16

all of these distinctions, but that doesn't -- and that

17

makes sense so far as (a) is concerned, but I don't

18

understand how it applies to (b).

19

MR. JAY:

Well, it -- it wanted to get rid

20

of the idea of different conceptions of residents under

21

different statutes, and different conceptions of

22

residents that applied to different types of defendants.

23

It wanted to have all of that standardized.

24

Now, that might sometimes result in the word

25

"resides" in a venue statute swallowing the rest to some

adversary's last point about the -- all of the cases,

like the pharmaceutical cases that will be upended and

13

MR. DABNEY:

I don't believe that -- I

14

believe that that provision -- that that argument is

15

overstated, for various reasons.

16

First of all, to the extent that venue

The judicial

Many generic companies have waived any

That was the holding in the Corda case in which

Alderson Reporting Company

55

So it is completely speculative to suggest

2

that simply upholding what Congress has seen fit to

3

provide by way of across-the-board venue protection for

4

patent litigation is necessarily going to prevent

5

litigation over putative generic drug manufacturers.

6

Secondly, the -- the Fourco case was one

7

whose critical holding was not based on the then content

8

of 1391(c), which, as Justice Kagan correctly pointed

9

out, whose breadth was no narrower then than it is now.

10

"For venue purposes," "for all venue purposes," it's

11

exact; there is no difference there.

12

What Fourco was so important is that it held

13

that 1400(b) is freestanding.

14

1391(c).

15

have a -- a word that has been construed by this Court.

16

That construction has never been overruled or changed by

17

Congress.

It is not supplemented by

So if we're looking at what 1400(b) means, you

18

And in the Pure Oil v. Suarez case in 1966,

19

Justice Harlan wrote for a unanimous Court that 1391(c)

20

applied to all venue statutes, except where there was a

21

restriction, and cited Fourco and the patent venue

22

statute as a specific exception.

23

structure of 1400(b) that specifically distinguishes

24

between resident and nonresident defendants makes no

25

sense, unless the statute is given its original meaning.

Why?

Alderson Reporting Company

Because the

Official - Subject to Final Review

56
1

You can sue a defendant in the judicial district where

2

his domicile is, or if you want to sue somewhere else,

3

you have to sue somewhere where there is both an act of

4

infringement and a regular established place of

5

business.

That is what Congress provided.

6

And -- and it's very revealing that -- that

7

my opponent cites as one argument for overruling Fourco

8

is that adoption of -- of the respondent's rule would

9

make more even-handed patent infringement cases and

10

actions for declaratory judgment.

11

a funnel of salt on 1400(b) itself, because when it

12

talks about actions for patent infringement, it's

13

talking about the civil action remedy provided by 35

14

U.S.C. section 281.

15

Well, that is simply

So those are the only kind of actions that

16

1400(b) applies to.

17

the way Congress wrote the law, that's just too bad.

18

That's not for a court to come in and -- and overrule

19

precedent in order to achieve a goal like that.

20

So if there is a -- a problem with

And I also heard conceded here that,

21

whatever might be the motivations for filing a patent

22

suit in a particular jurisdiction, it -- it is conceded

23

here that it is the interpretation of 1391, and -- and

24

the disregard of this Court's Fourco decision that has

25

made all this possible.
