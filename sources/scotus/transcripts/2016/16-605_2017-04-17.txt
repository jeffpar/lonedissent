ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

Had Laroe filed the lawsuit against the Town

12

of Chester, it would have been dismissed for lack of

13

standing.

14

intervention under Rule 24(a)(2), that things are

15

different.

16

However, Laroe claims that because it sought

That's wrong.
An intervenor of right is a full-blown party

17

and can invoke the full suite of powers of the Federal

18

judiciary, from subpoenas to summary judgment.

19

standing is not dispensed in gross and those indications

20

of judicial power must be grounded in Article III, and

21

that is particularly so because of two key facts.

22

First, Rule 24(a)(2) situates intervenors who are in a

23

different position from regular plaintiffs.

24

intervenors only must show that the existing parties

25

don't adequately represent their interests, so it is

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Insofar as

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

absolutely foreseeable that an intervenor will adopt a

2

different position than the parties in the case and

3

invoke Federal judicial power.

4

And, second, like here, when the party challenges the

5

standing of an intervenor in district court, that court

6

does not abuse its discretion when it conducts the

7

standing inquiry.

8

sorts of contingent derivative interests --

9

This rule is efficient, it avoids all

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It sets up a difference

10

between intervening on the defendant's side and the

11

plaintiff's side.

12

under your scheme, that's easy, but not on the

13

plaintiff's side.

14

disuniformity?

15

Intervening on the defendant's side

And why should there be that

MR. KATYAL:

Yeah, I don't know that there

16

is any sort of disuniformity.

17

is, Justice Ginsburg, is this case involves a plaintiff

18

intervenor and some of the defendant intervenor's

19

standards and stuff does get a little meta, and I don't

20

know that you have to reach it here.

21

The first thing I'd say

But if you were to reach it and you were to

22

ask, I'd say that the inquiry would be essentially the

23

same.

24

gave us the test for what that is, and it said in

25

Hollingsworth, ordinarily we think of standing as

This Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry basically

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

something about plaintiffs, but it's also true about

2

defendants too.

3

trying to bring an appeal or something like that, the

4

question is, how -- is the judgment below creating some

5

sort of concrete harm to them.

6

And when a defendant on appeal is

And we think that same test applies here.

7

It applies to both plaintiffs and defendants.

8

that sometimes it gets a little bit difficult in the

9

application.

Agreed

It's very easy to see how it applies for

10

plaintiffs, little more difficult for defendants, but we

11

aren't saying that the rules should be different.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You're saying the

13

intervenor must have the same standing as a plaintiff

14

would have.

15

the courts or the commentators.

16

And that hasn't been the understanding in

You're probably familiar with the

17

intervention commentary by David Shapiro in which he

18

said, it should go without saying, it must be understood

19

that there is a difference between the -- the question

20

whether one is a proper plaintiff in the -- or defendant

21

in an initial action, and the question whether one is

22

entitled to intervene.

23

MR. KATYAL:

So -- so we think with respect

24

to (a)(2) intervenors, they are full-blown parties.

25

That's what this Court in Eisenstein said.

Alderson Reporting Company

And for

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

those folks, they do have to show the same type of

2

standing as a plaintiff.

3

That doesn't mean that they have to show the

4

exact same standing.

5

than a plaintiff in a given case, but they are going to

6

exercise, Justice Ginsburg, their full suite of powers,

7

and it doesn't make sense to say that they should be off

8

the hook for --

9
10

They could have a different injury

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about permissive

intervenors?

11

MR. KATYAL:

Permissive intervenors are

12

absolutely different, as our brief explains, because

13

24(b) allows Federal courts to impose all sorts of

14

restrictions on them.

15

Court's decision in Stringfellow, in which the whole

16

complaint by the intervenor before this Court was, hey,

17

you know, I want to exercise the full-blown rights of a

18

party.

19

permissive intervention and imposed restrictions on, for

20

example, discovery.

21

to the Court and said that wasn't fair, we should have

22

been a full party, and this Court rejected that.

23

And so a good example is this

This district court only gave me 24(b)

And they said -- they -- they came

And Justice Brennan's opinion tracked

24

that -- his concurring opinion tracked that of the

25

majority in saying, essentially, courts have -- Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

courts have all sorts of powers over permissive

2

intervenors, that they don't.

3

discovery, they can restrict claims, all sorts of that.

4

That's not true for full-blown party status.

5

They can restrict

Now, one last piece, Justice Ginsburg.

It

6

is the case that some permissive intervenors under 24(b)

7

do have standing; and for those folks, they can

8

exercise, again, the full suite of powers, as long as

9

there's no restriction on them put on them by the

10

Federal court, but there's no Article III problem with

11

that.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- wrong with doing this.

13

Say -- think if a -- a party wants a court to do

14

something.

15

something, including an appellate court, unless you have

16

standing.

17

do no more than what the plaintiff, or in an appropriate

18

case, the defendant, wants them to do does not need

19

standing.

20

Now, you can't invoke a court's power to do

To say an intervenor, who wants the court to

But where an intervener wants a court to do

21

something different, then -- then he does need standing.

22

In which case, it would save the court lots of trouble.

23

If there are many interveners, you wouldn't have to look

24

into the standing -- or you would, if, and only if, they

25

want the court to do something different.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. KATYAL:

So, Justice Breyer, we agree

2

with much of that.

3

in your -- in your question about what an intervenor is,

4

we agree that everything you said makes sense for

5

permissive intervenors.

6

the reason they're coming to the court, as I was saying

7

at the outset, is because they disagree with what the

8

parties are doing.

9

So the -- the question is, though,

But for an (a)(2) intervenor,

They may disagree --

Put the two and a half --- perhaps with the

12

argument.

14

thinks he can make a better argument.

The lawyer, amazingly, thinks he's a better

15

MR. KATYAL:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct, but -But if he doesn't want

17

anything different than what they've already asked for,

18

why does Article III insist that he have standing?

19

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Breyer, I'm unaware of

20

anyone who thinks that they're -- that they're somehow a

21

better lawyer than someone else who doesn't think that

22

they would have a different take with respect to claims,

23

relief, discovery --

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. KATYAL:

that the town gives the plaintiff the money, and then he

4

will make his own case to say, I'm equitably entitled.

5

MR. KATYAL:

All he may want is

Well, let's take this very

6

case.

7

discovery, subpoenas, these are all very important parts

8

of civil litigation.

9

that.

10

So the sole petition at page 5 said, look,

Our entire blue brief is all about

They don't disclaim anything except claims in

relief.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

MR. KATYAL:

But why is there --

Even that, I think there's an

13

asterisk about, but -- which I'll explain in a minute,

14

but everything about the trial strategy, any -- they

15

haven't disclaimed any of that.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MR. KATYAL:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why --

And that's true about --- do you think there is a

19

real difference, Mr. Katyal, between claims in relief on

20

the one hand, in which case, yes, you need standing too,

21

and everything else on the other hand, in which case,

22

there's somebody with standing who has those claims, who

23

seeks that relief.

24

the court has authority to do, but this intervenor can

25

contribute to the way the court is thinking about the

So the court is doing exactly what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

case.

2

MR. KATYAL:

So for two reasons.

One is

3

this Court's decision in United States Catholic in 1988,

4

in which the Court said, quote, "The subpoena power of

5

the court is subject to those limitations inherent in

6

the body that issues them," because of Article III.

7

That is to say that subpoenas, all the discovery,

8

things -- the only way a court can act is with

9

Article III.

That is particularly so when you're

10

thinking about discovery.

11

opinion of this Court, from Iqbal to Twombly to Justice

12

Breyer's opinion in AMD, that say that discovery is

13

becoming the ball game in litigation.

14

confine Federal courts to their lane, as Article III

15

does, and allow bystanders, sometimes idealogical

16

bystanders who don't have Article III standing, you are

17

imposing that they use the massive power of the Federal

18

--

19

There have been opinion after

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And if you don't

Mr Katyal, I am totally

20

confused with the permissive and -- or automatic.

21

it's okay to do all of this with permissive intervenors

22

and all of the discovery and other burdens that you're

23

talking about, why isn't it okay to do it with automatic

24

intervenors who are limited to only the claims of relief

25

that the plaintiff has asked for?

Alderson Reporting Company

If

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

MR. KATYAL:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So Justice -Why -- why is there some

3

sort of added burden with respect to automatic that

4

doesn't exist with respect to permissive?

5

MR. KATYAL:

I might not have been clear.

6

It's not about the label.

7

That is, if a permissive intervenor is seeking

8

discovery, is seeking subpoenas, is seeking to invoke

9

the Federal judicial power, they must have standing.

10

It's about the function.

My only point is the types of people that

11

Justice Breyer is positing, the people who say, hey, I'm

12

just a better lawyer.

13

stuff, claims, relief or so on, those are permissive

14

intervenors or they are amici, and they don't need to

15

show standing in order for them to participate in the

16

lifecycle of the case.

I'm going to do the exact same

Does it --

That's often how -But does it matter

to you what -- at what point the Article III

burdensome discovery, can you wait until then, when the

3

other party objects, and say, well, now I've got to look

4

at your Article III standing, because you're doing

5

something that changes the litigation?

6

MR. KATYAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, we -- we

7

don't think we have to win that by any stretch.

8

certainly think that the "what" matters more than the

9

"one;" the "what" being that whenever Federal judicial

We

indications of power, be it subpoenas or summary

11

judgment, is invoked, that's when Article III standing

12

is required.

13

With respect to timing, we do think that

14

the best course of action for a bunch of reasons is to

15

do that at the outset.

16

reach that here.

17

friend on the other side would have to convince you that

18

that's somehow an abuse of discretion, which I think is

19

a very hard thing to do, in order for you to reverse the

20

decision below.

21

But, you know, you don't have to

Here, the district court did, and my

But here are some reasons why I think that

22

threshold inquiry makes sense at the front end.

23

the Federal Court is already reviewing 24(a)(2)

24

standards at that point, and it's a very closely

25

analogous, if not exactly identical, set of questions.

Alderson Reporting Company

One, is

Official - Subject to Final Review

13

And so it makes sense to do it all in one piece rather

2

than doing it separately.

3

Second, as my friend on the other side's

4

brief admits, there's no guarantee that that later

5

inquiry will even happen.

6

admits that they kind of hope it doesn't happen, that

7

some extra related claims will come in.

8

particularly so when it comes to, for example, Federal

9

Rule of Civil Procedure 45 subpoenas, as to which the

issued and the power of the Federal court is invoked.

12

And so there might not be that later testing that would

13

occur, unless you do it right at that front end.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They are just

Could Congress -- could

15

Congress enact a statute that provides for intervention

16

of right for someone who doesn't satisfy Article III?

17

There are -- there are several statutes that do provide

18

for intervention of right.

19

MR. KATYAL:

20

depends on what intervention means.

21

statute provides for full-blown party status for someone

22

who lacks the components of Article III, that, to me,

23

every day of the week, is unconstitutional and that is

24

precisely what they are advocating for.

25

say --

So -- so I think that it

Alderson Reporting Company

If a -- if a

That's what we

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it's got to be

2

conditioned on there being a party with standing

3

remaining in the suit.

4
5

MR. KATYAL:

there's a party with standing remaining --

6
7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That will solve that

problem.

8
9

And I think the fact that

MR. KATYAL:
Justice Kennedy.

I don't think it totally does,

It may solve part of the problem, but

10

to the extent that that person in that statute is

11

invoking Federal judicial power in a way different from

12

what that party with standing in the suit does, that

13

drops Article III.

14

This Court had said in DaimlerChrysler

15

standing is not dispensed in gross.

16

just because you have one plaintiff with standing that

17

allows someone else, an intervenor, to invoke the

18

Federal judicial power in all sorts of other ways, I

19

think that would be a pretty --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So putting -- putting

21

intervenors aside, suppose ten plaintiffs got together

And the district court satisfied itself that one

claims.

3

Does the district court have to go plaintiff

by plaintiff by plaintiff by plaintiff, sua sponte, and

5

decide whether each of them has standing?

6

MR. KATYAL:

They do not, Justice Kagan.

7

And the reason why, and this is what I was saying at the

8

outset, is that intervenors -- (a)(2) intervenors are

9

situated differently from those plaintiffs, because

plaintiffs generally march in lockstep.

12

have to certify to the court and prove inadequate

And so if you look, for example, at their
brief, the one case they had -JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think it is very odd that

you can be an actual party.

18

all of these things, you can do -- do your own

19

discovery, you can do -- and -- and that's fine with

20

you, but if you're named as an intervenor, then it

21

becomes not fine.

MR. KATYAL:

And presumably, you can do

So -- well, I think that, you

know, to the extent that some party didn't have

24

standing, it might be tested at that point.

25

think the case for threshold standing inquiries, akin to

Alderson Reporting Company

I just

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

what I was saying to the Chief Justice, I think it's

2

different for parties precisely because you can presume

3

that parties do march in lockstep.

4

And here's a very good example:

The only

5

case that they cite in their brief for when plaintiffs

6

don't march in lockstep is a case called Archer.

7

when you go back and look at that case, those parties

8

have filed the exact same discovery requests, and that's

9

generally how civil litigation unfolds with

10
11

And

co-plaintiffs.
It's very different when you're talking

12

about intervenors.

13

largest litigant, at pages 2 and 18, say -- and 23 --

14

say that intervenors -- it's extremely likely that

15

intervenors do deviate in terms of their indications of

16

judicial power from the existing parties.

17

that about co-plaintiffs.

18

The Solicitor General, the nation's

JUSTICE ALITO:

You can't say

Mr. Katyal, I was trying to

19

understand the -- the universe of cases in which a

20

party -- someone seeking intervention would be able to

21

come in under 24(a)(2) by claiming an interest relating

22

to the property or transaction, but would not be able to

23

claim injury in fact.

24

identify that universe of cases.

25

this is one of them; this case must be one of them.

And I -- I found it difficult to

Justice, and may it please the Court:

2

The best reading of Rule 24(a)(2) is that it

3

requires an intervenor, as a right, to demonstrate that

4

he has Article III standing by showing that he has a

5

cognizable interest cognizable under Article III, and

6

that it could be impaired by the disposition of the

7

pending lawsuit.

8

I'd like to start where Justice Ginsburg

9

started by focusing on how it works, sort of how you

10

establish standing when you're talking about

11

intervenors, and particularly, defendant intervenors.

12

Like Justice Ginsburg, most of the courts of

13

appeals that have held the other way have held that

14

standing is not required, have focused on whether an

15

intervenor can establish standing to initiate a lawsuit.

16

But in our view, that is not the appropriate focus.

17

What the rule itself focuses on is whether an intervenor

18

could be injured by the disposition of the pending

19

lawsuit.

20

And so the -- it's -- it's much more like

21

asking whether a party has standing to appeal than it is

22

like asking whether a party would have standing to

23

initiate a lawsuit.

24

is a particular outcome of the lawsuit that one of the

25

parties is trying to obtain and you ask if that outcome

What you look at is whether there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

happened, would it injure the intervenor, the potential

2

intervenor, such that that person, the intervenor, would

3

have standing to appeal.

4

And so it's the same whether you're talking

5

about a plaintiff or a defendant.

6

have an interest that's related to the underlying

7

dispute, but their injury comes from the disposition of

8

the lawsuit.

9

Now, they have to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In -- in what sense,

10

if any, is your position different from that of the

11

Petitioner's?

12

MS. HARRINGTON:

I think it's not

13

particularly different.

14

sort of, you know, a stronger line than we do on the

15

constitutional question.

16

I think everyone here agrees that there are some things

17

a party -- a litigant would do that don't require

18

standing, like presenting oral argument, filing briefs.

19

There are some things that do require standing, like

20

seeking damages, filing a new claim.

21

You know, I think they take

Our view is that you could --

There are -- in our view, there are some

22

other things in the middle that are kind of fuzzy.

23

our view, as a theoretical matter, you can imagine a

24

system where a person could easily obtain the label

25

"intervenor," and then a court could later inquire into

Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

that intervenor's standing, if and when they did

2

something that would require standing.

3

We think, as a matter of reading the rule,

4

that the rule -- that the drafters of the rule have --

5

have required that inquiry up front.

6

requirements of -- of Rule 24(a)(2) are best read to map

7

onto the Article III requirement --

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MS. HARRINGTON:

10

We think the

Why did they bother?

Why did they --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- if -- if the only

11

issue is standing, totally different language was used

12

by the rule drafters.

13

well, because to require standing, you need immediacy of

14

effect.

15

very clear that part of the interest in the property is

16

a contingent one.

17

interest will be destroyed.

18

not likely to permit standing in a lot of situations.

19

And I don't think they track very

And in a lot of these intervenor cases, it's

If the person loses the property, my

MS. HARRINGTON:

That's very contingent and

So there are sort of two

20

parts to your question.

21

it's true that the text doesn't track the modern

22

parlance of standing, but this rule was drafted -- was

23

-- was adopted in 1966, which is before this Court's

24

cases in like Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife --

25

The first, on the text, that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's great.

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

given that that's true, do you think -- are you saying

2

that Congress had it in mind to track the requirements

3

of standing, whatever they turned out to be?

4

of course, the Standing Doctrine in 1966 was nothing

5

like what it is now.

6

MS. HARRINGTON:

Because,

It was different, but the

7

-- but the Standing Doctrine and intervention rules have

8

always required that an intervenor or a party have an

9

interest.

10

And this Court, going back to the beginning

11

of the 20th century, has said that you -- that an

12

interest that is contingent or hypothetical is not

13

sufficient for intervention, just like it had said it's

14

not sufficient for standing.

15

Now, the predecessor to the 1966 version of

16

the rule allowed intervention as a right if a party

17

would be bound by the judgment, or if a party had an

18

actual interest in property that was going to be

19

distributed by the court.

20

of those sets of -- of people would have had standing,

21

and so that's kind of the people that I think the rule

22

drafters had in mind.

23

I think it's clear that both

There's certainly --

JUSTICE BREYER:

What kind of rule --

24

25

begin to get a kind of blank is defendant's standing.

Alderson Reporting Company

article?

5

What about on the initial -- when does -Are there -- is there a good

When does a defendant have or lack standing?
MS. HARRINGTON:

Justice Breyer, that's

6

where I tend to start, that I think the -- the focus of

7

the rule is on injury from the disposition of the

8

lawsuit.

9

talking about a defendant -- if the plaintiff gets what

And so what you would ask is -- when you're

10

it wants, will that harm the defendant?

11

it's natural to say, will it harm it in a way that would

12

give it standing to appeal.

And I think

13

And so what the defendant is trying to do

14

is, instead of waiting until that point, is trying to

15

come in and prevent the injury.

16

part of Justice Sotomayor's question about the

17

imminence.

18
19

This goes to the second

And the Respondent said -JUSTICE BREYER:

That gives the defendant

standing to --

20

MS. HARRINGTON:

It doesn't give --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- take position to

22

issue -- ask for subpoenas and so forth.

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

So if the

24

intervenor could be harmed by what the plaintiff wants

25

in such a way that the -- this intervenor would have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

standing to appeal, then the intervenor sees this injury

2

coming down the road -- this is an actual -- it's a

3

pending lawsuit, and so there's an imminent injury

4

that's -- that's coming the way of the defendant -- or

5

the intervenor, pardon me -- and so the intervenor wants

6

to get involved --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see your point.

8

MS. HARRINGTON:

-- and protect his

9
10

interest.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Ms. Harrington, I really

11

get confused when you invoke the Doctrine of

12

Constitutional Avoidance.

13

MS. HARRINGTON:

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yes.
So as I understand it,

15

you're saying, well, all right, Rule 24 is old and Lujan

16

is new, but let's match them up, and any ambiguity we

17

ought to just ignore or construe in your favor because

18

of the Doctrine of Constitutional Avoidance.

19

upshot of applying the doctrine here to avoid the

20

question whether intervenors have to have Article III

21

standing would be that we would have to ask the

22

Article III question effectively through the guise,

23

admittedly, of Rule 24 in every single case.

24
25

But the

I appreciate the candor of

16

MS. HARRINGTON:

17

(Laughter.)

18

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

He is a very capable lawyer

19

and has proven himself with respect to that argument, so

20

we're not pressing that -- that argument here.

21

A couple of --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can I ask you the same

23

question that I asked Mr. Katyal?

24

statute that said give someone a right to intervene,

25

someone who would not have Article III standing?

Alderson Reporting Company

Could Congress pass a

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

I mean, I think

2

Congress has done that in -- with a number of statutes.

3

I think in those cases, the intervention would be -- and

4

those intervenors would not be permitted to do something

5

that would require standing without a subsequent

6

assessment of -- of the standing of those intervenors.

7

So, you know, in this case, as in many

8

cases, I think the point of the intervenor that is

9

attempting to intervene is that he -- it wants to get

10

damages.

11

standing.

12

going to have to be some showing at some point down the

13

road that he has standing to get damages.

14

Well, you can't get damages if you don't have
And so even if he prevailed here, there's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I'm not sure I

15

understood your answer to the question.

16

this person does not have to show standing, Article III

17

standing, in the first instance, but if she tries to do

18

something different than what the plaintiff is doing,

19

she does?

20

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

You said that

I mean, I thought the

21

question was, if there was a -- setting aside

22

Rule 24(a), if there was a statute that authorized

23

intervention --

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Right.

There are -- there are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

several statutes.

2

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

So our view is, as a

3

constitutional matter, again, you could have a system

4

where you could easily get the label of intervenor, and

5

then a court could later inquire into your standing if

6

and when you did something that required standing.

7

We think Rule 24(a)(2) is best read to

8

require that standing upfront, and for some other

9

reasons that Mr. Katyal was saying.

That's because the

10

rule requires an intervenor to show that their interests

11

are not adequately represented by existing parties, and

12

that they're going to be injured --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so you think

14

it is satisfactory to -- it satisfies the constitutional

15

requirement of standing if Congress says you have

16

standing?

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

MS. HARRINGTON:

No.
No.

No, the question was, if

20

Congress says a party can intervene as of right, and

21

doesn't require a showing of standing.

22

that is a violation of the Constitution, as long as you

23

don't let that intervenor later do something that

24

requires standing --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, sure.

Alderson Reporting Company

We don't think

-- without then asking for

3
4

MS. HARRINGTON:

into that.

7

There have been a couple questions about

8

sort of piggyback intervenors.

9

keep in mind that there's Rule 24(b), which is -- allows

And I think you have to

10

permissive intervention.

11

expressly contemplates that a party has claims, has

12

legal questions, or factual questions in common with

13

existing parties.

14

And permissive intervention

And I think if a person just wants to come

15

in and say, oh, yeah, I have the same kind of claim you

16

do, they can seek permissive intervention, or they can

17

just file their own claim.

18

is that there's a potential injury from the disposition

19

of the lawsuit to the person who is trying to

20

intervene --

The point of Rule 24(a)(2)

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But there's --

-- and has that incentive.
-- that step that you

24

keep referring to which doesn't make any sense under

25

Article III, which is the one about whether the existing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

party is adequately protecting your interests.

2

MS. HARRINGTON:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's right.

The rule --

I -- let's assume

4

they've hired the best lawyer in the world, and they've

5

made every conceivable argument, but you're still a

6

contract vendor or -- with the kind of potential injury

7

that the others assume would give you standing.

8

it that we then read Article III into Rule 24?

9
10

MS. HARRINGTON:

Why is

Well, tell me if I'm not

getting your question right.

11

In our view, Rule 24(a)(2) requires a

12

showing of Article III standing.

13

have to show timeliness and inadequate representation.

14

And so in those two ways, it's a higher hurdle than

15

Article III is.

And in addition, you

16

But that's -- that's appropriate because it

17

is a person trying to come in and sort of intrude on an

18

existing lawsuit.

19

you really need to be able to come in, because,

20

otherwise, your interests are going to be impaired by

21

the lawsuit.

22

And there you need to show that --

So we think the ultimate question under

23

Article III is really the same as the ultimate question

24

under Rule 24(a)(2).

25

asking whether a person can initiate a lawsuit or can

And under Article III, if you're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

appeal, what you're asking is, do they have a

2

substantial enough interest in the outcome of this

3

actual dispute?

4

And it's really the same inquiry under

5

Rule 24(a)(2).

6

that's -- this Court has said it has to be an interest

7

that's legally cognizable, that's a significantly

8

protectable interest.

9

Do they have an interest that's --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, I know.

10

I'm asking a constitutional question, putting aside

11

exactly what the rule is.

12

But

If you say, all there has to be is an

13

existing case or controversy, and once there is, you

14

don't care whether the person has standing, Congress

15

could pass a statute saying anybody who the Court thinks

16

is appropriate -- you know, an expert in the area,

17

qualified with a record or whatever, they can jump in

18

and participate as a party, and you would say that's

19

okay.

20

MR. DVORETZKY:

Article III would not speak

to that particular bad idea by Congress.

have ample tools, the same as the tools they use now, to

12

If Congress

Now --

-- taking the case and --- I hope I haven't

given Congress an idea, but --

13

(Laughter.)

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, is that

15

consistent with what we've said, that Article III

16

standing plays an essential role in the separation of

17

powers?

18

MR. DVORETZKY:

Absolutely, because the

19

purpose of Article III, its core purpose, is to prevent

20

courts from issuing advisory opinions about the actions

21

of the political branches, absent a need to do so,

22

absent a case or controversy.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what if it's

24

a -- as it goes along, the defendant says, well, I'm

25

going to settle with the original plaintiff.

Alderson Reporting Company

Okay?

You

33

know, he's raised this claim.

2

I -- I'm still going to litigate against the -- the

3

Sierra Club.

4

I'm going to do this, but

Is that okay?
MR. DVORETZKY:

No, because at that point,

5

there would no longer be a case or controversy for the

6

Sierra Club to participate in, absent its own injury

7

that it was pursuing relief for.

8

The -- the key -- the key point under

9

Article III is that its purpose is to prevent the

10

judicial machinery from being mobilized in the first

11

instance, and opining on the actions of the

12

political branches --

I think defendant

24

doesn't make sense to ask whether a defendant

6

MR. DVORETZKY:

8

Here, of course, we have a

Yes.

But --

Can you give me an example

of that out -- outside of the context of this case?

9

MR. DVORETZKY:

Sure.

So an example might

10

be the plaintiffs in Clapper did not have standing

11

because there was no evidence in that case that their

12

interest in not being surveilled was actually being

13

infringed.

14

If, hypothetically speaking, you had a

15

resident of a house who was being surveilled or

16

plausibly alleged that -- that he was being surveilled,

17

perhaps the roommate of that individual whose cell phone

18

was not presently being wiretapped, whose movements were

19

not presently being tracked, would have an interest

20

under Rule 24.

21

impeded if the wiretapping program as to the house were

22

judged constitutionally --

23

That interest might well be impaired or

respect to union members who we've permitted to

intervene, even though the union has all of the claimed

contract rights.

13

MR. DVORETZKY:

In the Trbovich case, that's

right.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. DVORETZKY:

Yes.

What the Court recognized in

16

Trbovich was that the union member could intervene, not

17

to assert separate claim or relief, but to present

18

arguments, to potentially present evidence, and to

19

protect the union members' interest in that case.

20
21
22

JUSTICE ALITO:

And would they lack

Article III standing?
MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, the union member in

23

Trbovich would lack Article III standing, because of the

particular statute at issue there, in which Congress

authorized only the Secretary of Labor to bring suit.

And, in fact, the Article III

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, I don't see any

more with the defendant, how you can find a defendant

5

without standing on that basis?

6

find it relevant is because I think the other side is

7

arguing that an intervenor has to have standing in the

8

sense that a defendant has to have standing, at least

9

when you intervene on the side of the defendant, as most

10
11

I mean, the reason I

do.
MR. DVORETZKY:

So, first of all, it doesn't

12

make sense to speak about whether a defendant intervenor

has standing because a defendant intervenor is not the

14

one who is alleging an injury and invoking the authority

of the court.

Second of all --

say the only people that have to have stand -- I mean, I

19

don't know how to write this opinion unless you're

talking about standing in general.

21

And why can a defendant invoke the court's power on

22

appeal -- for example, subpoenas, discovery -- where

23

defendants all the time invoke the court's power, and

how can they do that if they don't have -- I don't even

To get back to Justice Breyer's question,

23

the reason that standing as an inquiry did not work in

particular for defendant intervenors is that there are

25

two contingents before a defendant intervenor can even

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42

be said to be injured.

2

The first is that the district court has to

3

rule in a way that the defendant intervenor doesn't

4

want, and the second is that then the defendant

5

intervenor has to actually be harmed by that, as opposed

6

to the defendant intervenor simply having an interest

7

that may as a practical matter --

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
to my original question.

Okay.

Fine.

That brings me back

A defendant can go and

10

get subpoenas and so forth, but if he has a

11

counterclaim, that's different, then he has to show

12

standing.

13

So why don't we apply the same standard to

14

the intervenors?

15

defendants in respect to intervening on the -- on either

16

side.

17

want something that somebody else doesn't want in this

18

case, then they have to have standing.

19

MR. DVORETZKY:

The intervenors have to be like

They can get subpoenas, et cetera, but if they

I think this goes to the

20

question of what is the standard for having standing.

21

In other words, what is it that you might want to do

22

differently that would require you to have standing.

23

And the only thing that you might want to do

24

differently that would require standing is asserting a

25

different claim or seeking a different form of relief.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, on -- on that

7

score, why isn't that exactly the case we have here?

8

The Plaintiff in this case, by way of relief, seeks a

money damages for the taking.

All right.

That's his

10

complaint, page 122 of the Joint Appendix.

11

page 162, wants damages for itself.

12

that the Plaintiff could not have had standing to obtain

for your client.

14

Your client,

That's something

Why isn't that a form of additional relief

where an intervenor wishes a judgment against the

defendant directly in its favor that would be

enforceable through all the mechanisms of post-judgment,

garnishment, liens, et cetera, and would offer your

21

different form of relief, isn't it?

22

Seems to me like that is a

MR. DVORETZKY:

Justice Gorsuch, the way in

23

which this case has been litigated, and trial counsel

24

conceded this in the Second Circuit, I'll represent it

25

to you here today, we are not seeking separate relief

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, except for the

complaint expressly says that.

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

The -- the complaint says

5

that, but oftentimes the complaint says one thing and

6

over the course of the litigation the theories might

7

develop differently.

8

at this point seeking relief here is relief to recover

9

for Sherman.

And the -- the way in which we are

10

We will at a later date need to figure out

11

how we'll get that money from him, and we would either

12

need to potentially settle that claim or have standing

13

to bring our own claim in Federal court or in State

court to get the money from him.

But the reason --

So you're disclaiming the

seeking at this stage?

21

MR. DVORETZKY:

The relief that we are

22

seeking is to maximize Sherman's recovery because we

have a stake in that recovery, and it's a stake that

Rule 24(a)(2) protects and gives us an ability to -- to

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Would you agree though

2

that if an intervenor did seek relief in its own name,

3

that that would be relief beyond that which the

4

plaintiff would be entitled to provide?

5

I mean, after all, plaintiff normally

6

doesn't have standing to seek a judgment in someone

7

else's name.

8

we'd have a problem here?

9

So would you agree in the normal case that

MR. DVORETZKY:

If -- if by the normal case

10

you mean a situation where an intervenor comes in and

11

asks for either additional money or money to be paid

12

separately --

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Or just a judgment in its

favor.

15

MR. DVORETZKY:

So whether it's a judgment

16

in its favor I think depends really on the scope of the

17

judgment.

18

This Court has repeatedly affirmed judgments

19

in favor of plaintiffs without inquiring into their

20

standing once it had assured itself that at least one

21

plaintiff in the case had standing.

issuance of a judgment is -- would be an inconsistent

If you would just answer my

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The question is whether a

plaintiff can seek a judgment against a defendant in

someone else's name.

11

that's not a trick question.

Generally not, right?

12

MR. DVORETZKY:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

That --

No, generally not.
Okay.

But --

So if an intervenor

14

then seeks a judgment in its name, generally speaking,

15

that's asking for relief beyond that which the plaintiff

16

has standing itself to provide, right?

17

MR. DVORETZKY:

Not -- not necessarily and

18

not the way this Court has considered the question in

19

numerous cases where it's affirmed judgments in favor of

20

parties without standing, or at least without inquiring

21

into their standing.

the Court has expressly said, we satisfy ourselves of

the jurisdiction -- of the standing of one plaintiff and

8

need not inquire further.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, no.

No.

No.

10

I know that, but that's -- that's -- those cases are

11

distinct, in that the Court is saying they need not

12

inquire further because those are separate parties, but

13

they're all seeking the same relief.

14

necessary at some point for the Court to inquire further

15

if it determines that the party is seeking to exercise

16

authority beyond Article III.

17

It may be

Sure, you don't have to decide cases that

18

might never come up or issues that might never come up,

19

but I don't see how that helps you.

20

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, no.

And we agree that

21

if, in fact, an intervenor -- if we ourselves came in at

22

a later date, filed and amended pleading and said now we

23

are seeking additional damages in our own name.

24

at that point, an Article III inquiry would be required.

25

Then,

But the point is that so long as we are not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

seeking a separate claim or separate relief, no inquiry

2

into standing is required, and that is what this case --

3

this Court's cases support.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, no.

But then

5

the question becomes if you are, then, exercising the

6

authority to issue subpoenas with respect to other

7

parties, you're exercising the authority of the court in

8

a way that expands beyond what the particular plaintiff

9

was seeking.

10

MR. DVORETZKY:

You -- you are, but you are

11

not exercising the authority of the court in a way

12

that's relevant to Article III, because you're not

13

seeking a separate claim or a separate form of relief.

14

What Article III is --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

to me to be circular.

17

reason why that is so.

18

But that just seems

I guess I was looking for a

MR. DVORETZKY:

The reason I don't think

19

it's circular is the purpose of Article III is not to

20

micromanage the conduct of litigation and how litigation

21

is conducted; it's to prevent courts from interjecting

22

themselves into a controversy in the first place.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's the

24

argument -- your argument in your brief, you focus on

25

case or controversy.

There has to be a case or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

Article III standing is an element of the case or

3

4

can put Article III standing to one side, while -- while

5

saying it's okay, because we still have a case or

controversy.

7

But we have said, repeatedly, that the

And so I don't know how you

MR. DVORETZKY:

Article III standing is an

8

element of the case or controversy requirement or an

9

interpretation of the case or controversy requirement,

10

but the requirement that this Court has imposed in order

11

to have standing, is an -- an intervenor's that is

12

injured, imminently, or concretely has been injured,

13

traceability, and redressability, all with respect to a

14

particular claim and a form of relief, not with respect

15

to things that happened along the way in litigation.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

With respect to

a particular party, you don't -- you don't just ask is

premise of the Petitioner's argument that I want to make

In theory, if the person

is simply whether the -- the interest may, as a

unless they want something that the plaintiff doesn't

So these are different

11

The -- the key point is that Rule 24 allows

12

an intervenor to intervene, if the intervenor's interest

13

may, as a practical matter, be impaired or impeded.

14

That is different than the stringent requirements for

15

standing, which require an actual or imminent injury,

16

not just may as a practical matter. Traceability and

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's assume, for the

15

sake of argument, that -- because I think, as I read the

16

district court's opinion here, they assumed you were

17

asking for judgment in your name, because they were

18

treating you as a contract vendor or vendee, and they

19

were saying, you don't have the right to have a judgment

20

in your name.

21

Would that holding have been wrong, absent

22

your current concession that -- that you are not seeking

23

money in your own name, but just a payment of money?

24
25

MR. DVORETZKY:

Justice Sotomayor, that --

that was not the state of play before the Second

2

54 of our brief -- and this is just a quote from the --

3

from the appellate lawyer in the Second Circuit.

4

is, quote, "exactly one fund, and the Town doesn't have

5

to do anything other than turn over the fund."

6

that's why the Second Circuit correctly found, and this

7

is Petition Appendix 9A, that -- the Laroe, quote,

8

"Asserts the same legal theories and seeks the same

9

relief" as --

And we quote in our brief -- this is at page

think an Article III standing inquiry would be

25

appropriate in that situation, and for reasons that --

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So your rule is always

2

on a motion to intervene, there is a standing inquiry.

3

The standing inquiry is whether or not you're asking for

4

relief different from someone with a case or

5

controversy.

6

MR. DVORETZKY:

I would put it slightly

7

differently, which is whether or not there needs to be a

8

standing inquiry depends on whether the intervenor is

9

seeking relief or asserting a claim different than the

10

existing plaintiff.

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

12

MR. DVORETZKY:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Let's use a hypothetical.
I'm sorry.
A -- a number of federal

14

prisoners are similarly situated with respect to a claim

15

that they're not being provided food consistent with

16

their religious beliefs.

17

wants relief as to him, because that's what he can seek

18

relief for, right?

One -- one brings a claim.

19

MR. DVORETZKY:

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

He

Uh-huh.
Okay.

Then we have 80

21

join him.

22

say, we want him to get his meal, or if -- if they seek

23

meals in their own name, a judgment running as to them,

24

do they have to show standing at that stage?

25

Can they join him, so long as they simply

MR. DVORETZKY:

I -- I think it depends on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

58

what relief the initial plaintiff is seeking.

2

seeking a declaratory judgment or an injunction

3

invalidating the prison's entire meal program, then I

4

think they can join.

5

saying, he, individually, is entitled to a particular

6

type of food and they would like that judgment to extend

7

to them, they need at that point standing, because

8

they're asking the defendant to do something different,

9

not only to provide him with particular food, but also

10

to provide it to them, whereas otherwise the defendant

11

would not be free to do that.

So I think it requires a careful parsing

relief only in his own name, an as-applied challenge.
MR. DVORETZKY:

To an as -- if it were an

17

as-applied challenge, then an additional plaintiff would

18

need to show standing because the question, again, is

19

what is the court ordering the defendant to do.

20

the touchstone for the relief.

21

requires standing.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

2

MR. KATYAL:

3

Three points.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
First, a 24(a)(2) mandatory

4

intervenor is a full party and can send thousands of

5

subpoenas or document requests without the court ever

finding out about them.

7
8

In two --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are there cases in which

courts have controlled 24(a)(2) intervenors?

9

MR. KATYAL:

There -- there are not.

10

Indeed, the court cannot restrict -- and this is, you

11

know, what Stringfellow says, it's what --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did your -- I think we

13

were just told that we think we have -- in fact, these

14

courts have limited 24.

15

MR. KATYAL:

They can limit it in the sense

16

that they limit parties, but they can't ban discovery

17

altogether from a party --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course not.

But

time.

23

MR. KATYAL:

We're not going to let you
The courts do that all the

Sure, they can do that.

Or

24

they could say -- but at the point where they are

25

restricting a full party, like an intervenor, from doing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

60
1

anything independently, they are no longer an (a)(2)

2

intervenor.

3

permissive intervenor at best, or they are an amici.

4

They are not doing anything.

5

a fundamental point, Justice Kennedy --

6

At that point, Justice Kennedy, they are a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that gets to, I think,

Well, I -- I don't want to

7

take up your time, but it does seem to me that district

8

courts have very substantial control over what mandatory

9

parties can do in the way of -- of duplicative and

10

oppressive discovery.

11

It happens all the time.

MR. KATYAL:

Well, we don't disagree with

12

that.

13

over 24(b) than they do over (a)(2).

14

where they are coming in and saying, we're going to do

15

everything exactly the same way, either because the

16

court has imposed that restriction on them or otherwise,

17

they aren't at that point an (a)(2) intervenor.

18

Our only point is that they have much more power
And at the point

And that gives rise to -- you asked,

19

Justice Kennedy, my friend on the other side, what --

20

what are we giving up?

21

of interventions?

22

of which dealt with the fact that amici and permissive

23

intervention provide for that participation.

24
25

When do we ever need these kinds

His first answer was Trbovich.

Trbovich is

a case in which that union member had Article III

standing.

2

wouldn't be screened out by our rule anyway.

So, you know, that would have -- that

The second thing he gave you was Clapper,

4

and a long thing about a -- a roommate that, you know,

5

might want to have a grievance here.

6

boomerangs.

7

wants them to -- intervenors -- (a)(2) intervenors to

8

raise stuff that parties legitimately can't raise

9

because of Article III standing.

10

That, to me,

That shows exactly what our point is.

He

And the only support he can have for that --

11

there's no support in the Constitution -- the only

12

support is page 30 of his brief, where he is admitting

13

that's what he wants intervenors to do.

14

And Justice Breyer, that is what intervenors

15

are doing right now.

16

explains that ideological intervenors are coming in now,

17

concerned bystanders like the Sierra Club or Club For

18

Growth.

19

-- the point is that that's happening right now, because

20

of (a)(2) intervention status.

21

some sort of upfront restriction on a threshold inquiry.

22

It doesn't matter ideologically, but it's just

And that's why you need

And then this is my last point, which it

23

gets to the Chief's question about, why would you need

24

to have a threshold inquiry?

25

reason is what the answer to Justice Gorsuch was given,
