ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID T. GOLDBERG

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. GOLDBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

There are three principal features of North

12

Carolina's law that make it a stark abridgement of the

13

Freedom of Speech.

14

First, Section 202.5 reaches vast swaths of

15

core First Amendment activity that is totally unrelated

16

to the government's preventative purpose.

17

Mr. Packingham is not accused of communicating with or

18

viewing the profile of a minor.

19

202.5 by speaking to his friends and family about his

20

experience in traffic court.

21

view or respond to any of the thousands of Twitter

22

messages about his case in this Court, that would be a

23

felony.

24
25

He violated Section

And if today he were to

Second, the law does not operate in some
sleepy First Amendment quarter.

speech on the very platforms on which Americans today

2

are most likely to communicate, to organize for social

3

change, and to petition their government.

4

Third, Section 202.5 --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

Please go ahead.

Please

go ahead.

7

MR. GOLDBERG:

-- is a criminal law, Your

8

Honor, that imposes punishment for protected First

9

Amendment activity without any regard to individual

10

culpability or lack of culpability.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could a State impose this

12

restriction as a condition of parole?

13

MR. GOLDBERG:

Your Honor, I think they have

14

much more authority to impose things as a condition of

15

parole, and -- and States do this all the time, and

16

they -- they -- they limit people's First Amendment

17

rights.

18

was as sweeping as this, for life, for anybody who had

19

committed a sex offense, I don't think they could do

20

that.

I think that they -- if you had something that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But --

Didn't -But they are -Justice Ginsburg.

The most fundamental

Alderson Reporting Company

right is taken away from ex -- fundamentals by some --

2

some States prohibit ex-felons from voting.

3

in the Federal government prohibits keeping and bearing

4

arms.

Some States

Those are constitutional rights.

5

MR. GOLDBERG:

Right, Your Honor.

So both

6

of those rights are different from the First Amendment.

7

They are equally fundamental, but they are different.

8

So in the case of voting, North Carolina does not take

9

away -- North Carolina draws the line at people who have

10

completed their parole, their period of supervised

11

release.

12

But in Richardson v. Ramirez, the Court

13

looked to the text and history and tradition and said in

14

Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment there was

15

affirmative sanction for felon disenfranchisement.

16

you look at that same section, which dealt with the

17

people who rebelled in the Civil War, you didn't need to

18

restore their First Amendment rights.

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a little

3

difficult to -- you said look at the text and history.

4

We don't have a lot of history here concerning access to

5

websites and all the sort of things we're dealing with

6

here.

7

So I don't think that's a very useful guide.
MR. GOLDBERG:

I agree, Your Honor.

But I

8

think when you look at what -- when we talk about the

9

history, the history is there isn't a tradition or a

10

history of taking away people's First Amendment rights.

11

When the Court said First Amendment rights are

12

inalienable, it has -- meaning when people --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My point is, though,

14

you don't have a lot of history of having -- having such

15

sites or access where they can provide broad access to

16

minors of the sort that is problematic with respect to

17

this individual.

18

MR. GOLDBERG:

Well, I don't disagree -- we

19

know as with violent video games, as with any manner of

20

new technologies the Court has confronted, there

21

isn't -- there isn't a framing era or -- or

22

reconstruction-era analogue.

23

when you talk about all of the things that the State

24

historically has restricted, they never said you lose

25

your right to publish a newspaper because you've been

kidnapping children from visiting a nursery school.

7

Would -- would that be a violation of the First

8

Amendment?

MR. GOLDBERG:

said that someone who was a sex offender could not

agree that that would be constitutional?

5

MR. GOLDBERG:

Would you

Well, I think my first answer

is that it would be much less restrictive, and that

shows why this law is unconstitutional; right?

that's exactly what the prosecutor --

MR. GOLDBERG:

would be, Your Honor.

22

is if you take the test, the narrow-tailoring test,

23

which is fundamentally a -- this Court had said in -- in

24

Ward, a quantitative test, and you say, what percentage

25

of what you suppress implicates the interest?

I think that the difference here

Alderson Reporting Company

When

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

you're talking about communicating with minors or

2

viewing the pages of minors, that is going to the

3

heartland of the protective interests that the State is

4

asserting.

5

But here, everything that -- that they're

6

suppressing is -- as we've said, it's indifferent as to

7

whether it's core speech.

8

convicted for saying, "Thank you, Jesus.

9

about a parking ticket to an audience.

10

Obviously, Petitioner was

JUSTICE ALITO:

God is good"

But you think that even as

11

narrowly tailored as Justice Ginsburg's example, so it

12

would be a crime for a convicted sex offender -- or

13

let's say someone who was convicted previously of

14

committing a sex offense using the Internet from

15

contacting on the Internet a person who is known --

16

known by that person to be a minor without the consent

17

of the parents of the minor?

18

of the First Amendment?

19
20

MR. GOLDBERG:

23

No.

I -- I -- I said I think

that would be constitutional, Your Honor.

21
22

That would be a violation

Oh, I thought you said it

wouldn't be.
MR. GOLDBERG:

clear about that.

25

narrow-tailoring questions.

with this law that I think you've -- you've handled by

4

everybody on the registry, and it applies in a --

5

essentially on a statistical basis on the theory that as

6

a collective, they have a higher rate of recidivism than

7

people on average.

8
9

And I think this Court's First Amendment
cases say that's a very problematic assumption to

11

is so heterogeneous and that is constantly being

evaluated on an individualized basis.

6

and your cyber -- and your cyber equipment and disclose

7

8

law that every -- that every convicted person has to

9

consent to that -- to that app and to that surveillance?

10

MR. GOLDBERG:

Could that be a

Well, I think that goes to

11

the question of -- which you don't need to answer and I

12

want to answer Justice Sotomayor's question as well in

13

this case.

14

mean in terms of somebody's constitutional rights?

15

I think that is clearly a much less restrictive from a

16

First Amendment perspective, because then, again, people

17

like Mr. Packingham, anybody who wants to do the things

18

that are harmless and fully protected is able to do it.

19

People have -- and it is -- is effective detection and

20

deterrent.

What does the status of being a registrant

MR. GOLDBERG:

Well, I take it --- have no problem

whatsoever.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I take it, Mr. Goldberg,

13

that a part of what the State is saying here is that it

14

doesn't have the capacity to do that.

15

the capacity to check message-by-message or

So why wouldn't the

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

MR. GOLDBERG:

Well -- well, Your Honor,

2

we -- obviously, there are times when prophylactic rules

3

are permissible under the First Amendment.

4

Mr. Packingham, when he was convicted, got a condition

5

that said you shall not have any contact with the

6

specific victim of this crime.

7

if that were applied to you or me, that would be a -- an

8

abridgement of our freedom of speech.

9

That would -- otherwise,

So there's no general rule.

The Court has

10

said repeatedly that you should be suspicious of

11

prophylactic rules because, ordinarily, you don't want

12

to -- you want to allow people to speak.

13

we've been talking about rules like -- that are focused

14

on teenagers on the Internet and having specific contact

15

with them, those are prophylactic rules too.

16

think it's -- the question is, can you do it at the

17

first step?

MR. GOLDBERG:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I don't -If that's constitutional,

3

instead of what most of the briefs do, is interpret the

statute as broadly as possible, this is a facial

challenge.

seems to me a necessary condition is that a violator

21

And is it possible to read

And if you do read it that way, is it

points.

I think you start with, what is the First Amendment

right that is being abridged?

But that's what I --

I wanted to be -- I wanted to get your answer, and I

3

think I have that.

4

MR. GOLDBERG:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then -But I'm really interested

in the narrow possibility of interpreting it narrowly,

as I said.

8

constitutional, though it could be applied

9

unconstitutionally.

10

And on that basis, it's facially

That's what I want your answer to.

MR. GOLDBERG:

So, Your Honor, this is a

as-applied challenge because the relief that we're

14

seeking is to overturn the --

15

to your client?

18

MR. GOLDBERG:

In a criminal case, you --

19

the Court has the power to say -- and I think it's

20

appropriate in this case -- that this -- the problem

21

here is the problem for every application.

22

what we've argued.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. GOLDBERG:

25

And that's

Okay.
And clearly -That's -- then we're back

challenge.

So I'm treating it as an as-applied

I don't want to just repeat the question.

3

MR. GOLDBERG:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

Right.
I want to get your answer

to the question.

6

MR. GOLDBERG:

Right.

So -- so the answer

7

is, Your Honor, that this -- that narrow construction,

8

I'm not sure that -- that's possible, and that narrow

9

construction isn't going to be -- in this case, make any

10

difference, because as I understand your hypothetical

11

statute or construction, that is not -- Mr. Packingham

12

did not violate the law, but --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Wait.

Don't you see, all

14

I'm doing is reading one word before information

16

information exchange.

17

clause, too, which you're much more familiar with than I

am --

And the word I'm reading is related
And as so interpreted, that

19

MR. GOLDBERG:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

Sure.
-- seems to be talking

about dating sites or the lower age level equivalent.

22

MR. GOLDBERG:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't -If -- if that's -- it does

24

what it says, facilities the social introduction between

25

two or more persons for the purposes of friendship,

2

I've now got it a social dating or equivalent site.

3

MR. GOLDBERG:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
I think I can say that.

5

Now, if I say that, is it constitutional?

6

I'm trying to get your answer to.

7

MR. GOLDBERG:

That's what

If -- if it were limited to

8

dating sites, I'm assuming that it is constitutional,

9

Your Honor.

I don't think the State has ever said that

10

this is about dating sites.

11

category of --

12
13

They -- they say there's a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
because of your case.

14

MR. GOLDBERG:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

Exactly.

So your case involved

boasting about getting off a traffic ticket.

17

MR. GOLDBERG:

Right.

So -- so that -- that

18

is my first and most important point, that

19

Mr. Packingham was not on a dating site.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

So then the answer to this

21

would be they have not applied it that way here, and

22

given the way they've applied it here, they can't do

23

that.

24

MR. GOLDBERG:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't -Now, we're going to have 40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

other cases involved.

2

MR. GOLDBERG:

I don't think they've ever

3

applied it.

4

to have age restrictions that go -- apply only to adults

5

and so I think it's their position that those are

6

excluded from this.

7

position, and you can hear from them, they've never

8

proposed that as a construction because they want to go

9

after these -- these sites, the classic

10
11

I think the main focus -- dating sites tend

I -- they're -- I think the State's

social-networking sites.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, the -- the

12

interpretation that Justice Breyer -- the -- the

13

language that Justice Breyer is referring to and other

14

language in this statute, I think, could, for the

15

purpose of avoiding First Amendment problems, be limited

16

to core social networking sites, including Facebook and

17

things like Facebook, Google Plus, that sort of thing,

18

and excluding a lot of the other sites that the

19

electronic frontier says are included, like the New York

20

Times and Betty Crocker and things like that.

21

would be limited just to social networking sites.

So it

22

Would you agree that it could be read at --

23

using constitutional avoidance, it could be narrowed to

24

at least those?

25

MR. GOLDBERG:

So honestly, Your Honor, I'm

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

not sure that it can, but it's very important for the

2

constitutional question that that is irrelevant.

3

this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's question, which

4

was what is -- how do we win this case?

5

the -- what is the biggest problem with this statute?

6

And the biggest problem is --

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

What is the --

Well, just to put it in --

8

in context.

9

as-applied challenge because if -- what your -- what

10

It -- it is important for purposes of an

your client used was a social -- was Facebook, right?

11

MR. GOLDBERG:

Right.

for the very reason we've talked about, which is that

this -- just like the law in the Jews For Jesus airport

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I mean, one of

my problems with all of these sites today is that none

2

of them are purely -- or very few of them are purely

3

anything anymore.

4

MR. GOLDBERG:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
Take something like

6

LinkedIn, which many, many people in our society today

7

are looking for jobs there, but high school students are

8

permitted to look for jobs and to post their data,

9

personal data on that site.

10

So, is that traditional social media or not?

11

MR. GOLDBERG:

12

that it is because it meets the definition.

13
14
15

I -- I think the State says

I just want to get back to Justice Alito's
question -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's my point,

16

which is -- I'm -- Facebook, many people, many

17

businesses are using it for commercial advertising.

18

MR. GOLDBERG:

Right.

And -- and that's

19

very true and -- and there was another defendant who was

20

prosecuted alongside Mr. Packingham who was an IT

21

person, Mr. Christian Johnson, and he lost his job

22

because his employer said it's impossible for you to do

23

your job if you can't get on these sites, so --

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Even if you don't -Well, all of -- all of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

these questions implicate what Justice Sotomayor asked

2

earlier and I and others interrupted you.

3

What is the category that we use?

If -- if

4

we rule for you, we say this statute is a violation of

5

the First Amendment because, what -- what are -- what

6

are the basic rules or the basic --

7

MR. GOLDBERG:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

So -- so the basic rules --- doctrinal choices you

offer us to say why this is unconstitutional?

10

MR. GOLDBERG:

Sure.

So the most

11

straightforward, basic doctrinal basis to say it's not

12

narrowly tailored and stop there or overbroad, which is

13

the flip side.

14

confusing word because it has this third-party standing

15

dimension.

16

goes way too far because it prohibits lots of First

17

Amendment speech.

18

Sometimes overbroad is a -- is a

In the airport case, it was used to say this

So if you just take the word narrow

19

tailoring test or you take the test in Frisby, in

20

Taxpayers v. Vincent where you say does this -- is the

21

theory of this law that it restricts speech on the

22

possibility that that will lead to some other harm, that

23

inherently is not going to be a narrowly tailored law.

24

Or you can look at it the way Weir did which -- which

25

said let's look at how much of -- is -- is protected

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

activity is suppressed, how much of that implicates this

2

purpose and, again, that's a really straightforward way.

3

Now that -- we think, and our brief argues

4

that there are multiple prongs.

5

prong of the word "analysis," this is a really stark

6

case in terms of alternative channels.

7

as I said, some of the most important channels of

8

communication in our society.

9

If you go through every

This forecloses,

So -- so you could do that, you could say

10

that too.

11

is once you get -- if it's not narrowly tailored, that

12

then it's unconstitutional and I don't see --

13

But what -- what the Court said in McCullen

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, one of the --

14

I mean, under narrow tailoring, I think it's -- it's

15

incumbent upon you to come up with a narrow -- more

16

narrowly tailored alternative.

17

So if you wanted to -- you're in the North

18

Carolina legislature and you're told you can't do this,

19

what would you do as the most effective alternative?

20

MR. GOLDBERG:

Well -- well, Your Honor,

21

I -- I think the opinion in McCullen said it was not

22

incumbent on the challenger to come up with the

23

alternative, but here it -- it said the State has to

24

show that it seriously considered alternatives, but --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Right.

So I think that --

that --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess in

8

response to that is, well, how do you know that it's --

9

that it's a minor or -- or how is the -- I -- I mean, I

10

assume that minors can put on -- they -- they don't have

11

to have their age in their e-mail.

12

communicate it in the text of the --

13

MR. GOLDBERG:

15

put on the site.

16

that that's not terribly effective.

17

They don't have to

So --- message that's

So I -- I think the response might be

MR. GOLDBERG:

So -- so two -- two answers

18

to that.

blue brief where -- where there is the closing argument

20

by the -- the DA in this case, the DA lays out what --

21

again, this is not a case where we've come up with some

22

exotic theory about how you could narrow this law.

23

the DA says to the jury, in order to convict, you might

24

not like this law, you might prefer a law that says

25

don't have specific contact on Facebook with minor

First of all, if you look at page 11 of the

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

children or a law that says don't say specific things

2

that might entrap teenagers, and this law doesn't say

3

that.

4

if you don't like it, the law says you can't access.

5

So --

6

It doesn't.

But even if you don't agree with it,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Maybe he doesn't say

7

it because it wouldn't work.

He doesn't say that the

8

law would be perfectly fine.

He says here's an

9

alternative you might like.

Maybe the legislature

10

didn't enact it because it made the -- concluded that it

11

wouldn't be effective.

12

MR. GOLDBERG:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I

13

think it would be effective or ineffective exactly the

14

same way this law is effective or ineffective.

15

The -- the premise -- one of the things that

16

the State argues about effectiveness is that this law

17

will prevent people from doing something.

18

it prevents people is by punishing them and deterring

19

them.

20

and -- and as Justice Kennedy was asking about

21

monitoring, that's a way that you can actually detect

22

what people are up to.

23

The only way

It -- it doesn't enable the State to find people,

The nature of this law is that it finds --

24

it's most likely to find the people who are doing

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

3

For many years, North Carolina, like other

4

States, had laws prohibiting sex offenders from being at

5

physical places where children congregate; schools,

6

playgrounds, day cares, and parks.

7

In 2008, North Carolina decided to prohibit

8

sex offenders from being at virtual places where

9

children congregate online; specifically, commercial

10

social networking websites.

11

North Carolina passed Section 202.5 to cover

12

the people most likely to sexually assault children.

13

Unlike some of the other alternatives -- or unlike the

14

alternatives proposed, this law is enforceable and

15

effective.

16

One of the things that was said --

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Social networking, it

18

includes Facebook, obviously; it includes LinkedIn; it

19

includes Twitter; is that right?

MR. MONTGOMERY:

That -- that would be

correct.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -- so a -- so a person in

23

this situation, for example, cannot go onto the

President's Twitter account to find out what the

President is saying today?

MR. MONTGOMERY:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

but assuming we had a public square a hundred years ago,

18

could you say that this person couldn't go into the

19

public square?

20

described and their utility and their -- and their --

21

extent of their coverage are -- are greater than the

22

communication you could ever had, even in the paradigm

23

of public square.

24
25

believes that narrows the statute is that the site must

try to prevent sex offenders from finding out

JUSTICE KAGAN:

When you just said to

Justice Ginsburg, well, maybe that would be

unconstitutional if they included these things that are

you can find out much more information than you could

MR. GOLDBERG:

19

I'll -- I'll try to make four points.

20

Thank you, Your Honor.

As to the New York Times, our main

21

submission is it doesn't matter.

22

because it is overbroad as applied to any one site --

23

but that reading of the statute doesn't work

24

grammatically.

25

it talks about sites that create web pages or personal

4

without creating web pages.

And in (a), it says to become members or
So you can't have a links

5

Second, when they told Mr. Packingham what

6

this law requires and what this means, they didn't say

7

anything about links.

9

decisional purposes -- they said to the extent that the

If you look at the State supreme

10

Petitioner is right, there are alternatives.

11

didn't embrace this construction.

12

So they

And just recently on this question of

13

Snapchat, after the State filed the brief, which is all

14

about links, they prosecuted somebody for using

15

Snapchat, which is a site that doesn't have links of the

16

kind that -- that we're talking about.

17

So that construction and -- and, as my

18

friend is saying, maybe somebody might understand what

19

"profile" means, but this is a criminal statute.

20

think if any of us were advising somebody on the

21

registry whether they can do it, the plain language, the

22

history, and the Supreme Court opinion all say you're in

23

great danger of -- of liability here, steer clear.

So I'm not

13

I think on the -- on the question of -- so

14

there are people in Ladue who did not have lawn signs,

15

but there are more than three billion people in the

16

world who are using these sites, a very small --

MR. GOLDBERG:

JUSTICE ALITO:

But --- percentage of people -But what I'm asking is

20

whether the existence of alternative channels asks

21

whether these are channels that people like to use or

22

whether if the channels that are affected by the statute

23

are taken away, there are still alternative channels.

5

at that time have been taken away.

6

alternative channels then, why would there not be

7

alternative channels now?

MR. GOLDBERG:

you have to look at it -- and this is back in 2008 --

10

and you have to look at it in practical terms about what

11

people's communicative life is and what -- what they're

12

able to do.

13

And if you look at the cases that had

14

enforced those -- that requirement, if you look at

15

16

18

substantial amount of -- of access and protected speech.

19

20

These are the places where everybody is speaking and

21

interacting and looking for work and petitioning the

22

government.

that's the test.

First Amendment activity is foreclosed.

5

the world is as strong -- this is, as Justice Kennedy

6

said, well beyond the traditional town square.

7

sure there were people who didn't go to the town square,

but that wouldn't be a basis for -- for upholding a

restriction there.

I don't think

The test is how much of your core

The -- the core point here, though, is that
