ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

In Mansell v. Mansell, this Court held that

11

the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act

12

does not authorize State courts to treat waived Military

13

Retirement Pay as divisible property in divorce.

14

question in this case is whether Mansell's holding

15

applies only to waivers that preceded the divorce, or

16

whether it applies to all waivers no matter when they

17

occur, and we respectfully submit that the latter

18

interpretation is correct.

19

points this morning.

20

the statute compels our interpretation, and the second

21

is that we think our interpretation just makes sense.

22

The

And I'd like to make two

One is that we think the text of

So our first argument is based on the text,

23

and I think it's just inescapable that what the State

24

court did here was divide Petitioner's waived retirement

25

pay.

And I think that can be seen from the fact that if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

the State's court's order had simply just said,

2

henceforth, Petitioner's waived retirement pay is now

3

divided, if that's -- those were the words of the

4

modification order, there would have been no difference

5

at all in effect than what actually occurred in the

6

modification.

7

So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose that what the

8

court had said is, taking a look at what the retirement

9

pay is now, how much it is total, and had specified then

10

a dollar amount for the wife equivalent to what the half

11

was before the disability benefits, that would be okay;

12

and if it takes disability later, she still keeps the

13

amount that was awarded, the dollar amount.

14

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So, I'm sorry.

If the

15

question was if the -- if the modification order had

16

simply said you have to pay a dollar amount equal to the

17

amount that you've waived, if that was the modification

18

order, we can assume the same preemption concern that

19

exists because that's the economic equivalent of a

20

division of the --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

I -- I think

22

Justice Ginsburg's question is, the original divorce

23

decree here said Petitioner's entitled to and is awarded

24

as her sole and separate property 50 percent of

25

Respondent's military retirement.

Alderson Reporting Company

If it had read

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

Petitioner's entitled to $250 a month, period, full

2

stop, to ensure that that is received by her, she'll get

3

$250 a month from his Military Retirement Pay.

4
5

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So I -- if -- if that was a

settlement, then I think that it would be enforceable.

6

Our position today has nothing to do with

7

the enforcement of settlements.

8

divorce court said that the settlement as written only

9

authorized Respondent to receive half of Petitioner's

10
11

pension.

In this case, the

That's why it modified it.
But if the original order had simply

12

specified a dollar value per month, then we would have

13

no objection to enforcing that.

14

if Petitioner had agreed to express indemnification

15

provision and thereby, you know, waived his rights under

16

the USFSPA, we think that litigation waiver would be

17

okay, would be enforceable, just like any other waiver

18

in litigation.

In the same sense that

19

So I -- I do agree that if there's simply a

20

dollar figure that Petitioner had signed, that would be

21

unobjectionable.

22
23
24
25

And the other --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So could she go back to

court now and ask for a dollar figure instead?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I -- I don't think so,

because I think that that would be a modification

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

imposed by the court that would be -- that Petitioner

2

never agreed to, so he's never waived this protection

3

over --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

She can't go back into

5

court -- I thought in divorce courts you can go back and

6

change circumstances and seek a modification of the

7

monetary awards.

8

Why can't she do that?

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I think the question

9

is whether this particular type of changed circumstance,

10

which is a waiver of Military Retirement Pay, authorizes

11

this particular remedy, which is this indemnification

12

order.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is -- is the answer that

14

there's a difference in adjusting alimony payments

15

and property -- and -- and property settlements that

16

have been concluded?

17

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

18

Absolutely.

19

interfering with the State court's power over alimony.

20

And I think we expressly say that in our reply brief.

21

We -- we don't agree the USFSPA is

I mean, if Petitioner -- if -- excuse me --

22

Respondent needed more alimony, the statute has the

23

savings clause that expressly says that she can come

24

back to court and get more.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

An alimony is something

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

that one spouse pays to the other based on economic

2

need.

3

property outright.

4

she is getting from somebody else.

5

there's an enormous difference between equitable

6

division of property and alimony.

7

The division of property gives a spouse the
It's hers.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

It's not something that

Yes.

It is hers, because

That is our exact

8

position, Justice Ginsburg.

9

does not interfere with the ability toward alimony, but

We think that the statute

10

this was a division of property, and here's a Federal

11

statute which is defining the ex-spouse's property

12

interest as half of the residual share of the pension.

13

So --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This -- this is a

15

pretty basic question I should know the answer to, but

16

when you talk about dividing the property, is that by

17

any proportion?

18

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

two-thirds/one-third?

21

50/50?

22

Yes -You get

It's not -- doesn't have to be

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

That's correct.

So Arizona

23

is a community property State, and so property is almost

24

invariably divided 50/50.

25

exceptions which are not applicable to this case.

There -- there are some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

Other states, equitable division states,

2

sometimes deviate from 50/50 divisions, but even if they

3

were 60/40, I think that would still be a division of

4

property; it would just be an unequal division of

5

property.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it under the community

7

property law that the 50 percent that the spouse

8

received of the retirement pay was hers even if they

9

hadn't been divorced?

10

In other words, what is community property?

11

I thought community property is the two spouses'

12

interest in the property, each of which owns half from

13

day one.

14

Is that right?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yes.

That is what

15

community -- how community property works.

16

the Federal statute is defining what the State courts --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:
arguing for you.

20

divorce decree changed nothing.

21

was hers.

23
24
25

So is -- is --

You're not -- I'm not

19

22

But here,

In that case I'll ask him.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

But the

Yes.

It simply gave her what

That is our

interpretation of the divorce decree.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how could he take any

action that impinges on what's her money or her property

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

right?

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -I -- I think that's the

4

U.S.'s position and your adversary's, which is, if, as a

5

result of the original settlement divorce decree, it

6

became her property, what right did he have any -- to

7

take any action that would remove that property or take

8

it away from her?

9

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I think the question

10

is what is her property right.

11

if you define her property right as one half of the

12

total retirement pay, regardless of whether a waiver has

13

occurred, then yes, under that conception of that being

14

her property right, in fact, Petitioner would have

15

converted part of her property right.

16

And you're right.

If --

But the point is the Federal statute, what I

17

think it's saying is it doesn't allow the State courts

18

to define the community property right that way.

19

it's saying is the definition of the community property

20

right is the total amount of the retirement pay minus

21

the waived portion.

22

What

And so if the State court -- and, in fact,

23

that's actually what the State court did in the -- in

24

the Petitioner appendix pages 12a and 13a.

25

it's saying is that Respondent's property right was half

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, what

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

of the total retirement pay, but I think that's exactly

2

what this Federal definition is designed to prevent

3

State courts from doing.

4

So, you know, I -- that's why I think that

5

it's just inescapable that what happened in this case

6

was just a flat-out division of Petitioner's waived

7

retirement pay.

8

a direct conflict with Federal law.

9

And so that's why we view this as just

I don't think the Court even needs to get to

10

implied peremption and purposes and objectives.

11

think this is just doing what -- the -- the thing that

12

Federal law says that State courts can't do.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We

What about them saying we

14

divided the property based on a certain expectation that

15

the wife would have so much, and now, because the amount

16

is lower, then the divorce decree should be reopened so

17

we can give her more of another asset to make up for

18

what she's missing.

19

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So I think that reopening

20

the decree to just give her another asset would be --

21

which is essentially what happened in this case -- would

22

be preempted by Federal law.

23

Now, we're not saying Federal law preempts

24

the situation where State court says:

25

find as a matter of State law that the ex-spouse just

Alderson Reporting Company

Okay, when we

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

didn't understand what she was signing, there's some

2

kind of mutual mistake.

3

So if -- the reopening of the decree would

4

not be preempted.

5

reached a new settlement, that would be okay, or if the

6

divorce court entered a new decree that complied with

7

Federal law, that would be okay too.

8
9

In that case, if the parties just

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What would be

noncomplying with Federal law if you reopened the

10

divorce decree and the judge says now you get a share --

11

a larger share of some other property?

12

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I think that that

13

would essentially render Mansell a -- a dead letter

14

because, you know, just returning to the pre-divorce

15

context, the effects of Mansell where the waiver

16

happened before the divorce, it seems to me that if a

17

divorce court just said, I'm going to raise the

18

equitable share by the exact amount of the waiver

19

because I just don't agree with Mansell and I want to

20

nullify it, I mean, that would just directly conflict

21

with the whole point of Mansell's holding, which is that

22

the waiver of the retirement pay lowers the amount of

23

divisible property.

24
25

I'd also hasten to add that that -- that is
not what happened here.

Arizona is not an equitable

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

division State.

2

the assets have to be divided 50/50 and just defined the

3

relevant asset subject to division as the total amount

4

of the Military Retirement Pay, which I think is just

5

contrary to the Federal definition.

6

I think the Court was saying that all

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But could a court say, well,

7

in light of the fact that the woman is not getting the

8

usual community property division, that that factor

9

could -- that that could factor into the determination

10

of alimony or the determination of child support?

11

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So I think it actually

12

could, yes.

13

court was, you know, because of this waiver, I just -- I

14

can't afford daycare payments for the child and I -- I'm

15

responsible for them.

16

saying, I need child support, that's a need-based issue,

17

it's not a property division, then yes.

18

saving clause of this statute carves out child support

19

and alimony orders from the preemptive force.

20

I think that if the situation before the

And she can come back to court

This -- the

So I think that, as long as the court is

21

applying child support and alimony standards, which are

22

based on need, it's based on -- they're usually

23

temporary until the child becomes the age of majority

24

or, you know, the wife gets back -- or the husband gets

25

back on his or her feet.

So as long as the court is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

actually applying the alimony and child support

2

standards, we actually don't read this statute to

3

impinge on a State court's authority at all.

4

just not what's happened in this case.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's

Well, as I pointed out,

6

those are different animals then that -- the -- the

7

property belongs to her, alimony and child support.

8
9

And alimony, suppose she remarries.

It

ends, right?

10

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

11

I'd like to just turn for a moment as to why

Correct.

Yes.

12

we feel our -- our position makes sense, because we

13

framed our second argument in our brief as ensuring the

14

purpose of the veteran keep all of his disability pay,

15

both in form and in substance.

16

I think it makes sense that Congress would

17

have wanted veterans to keep all their disability pay

18

for the obvious reason that it's the veteran who's

19

disabled.

20

substitute for income that the veteran can't earn

21

because of his or her disability.

22

defined.

23

reduced income potential.

24

it makes perfect sense.

25

the veteran should keep the disability pay.

And the point of the disability pay is to

That's how it's

You get a disability rating if you have a
And so I think that this -I think everyone agrees that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

The reason this dispute has come up is that

2

Congress has made this decision to cut a veteran's

3

pension or to force a veteran to waive a portion of his

4

own pension, which has already been earned, if he also

5

becomes disabled and accepts the disability pay.

6

that's a pretty harsh judgment that Congress made,

7

essentially, to protect the public fisc, but that's what

8

Congress did.

9

And

So I think that what the statute is doing is

10

saying if the veteran is forced to do that, then the

11

veteran and the ex-spouse will both have their amounts

12

reduced by an equal amount; in other words, what's

13

divisible is just going to be the residual share.

14

think that's what this statute is doing.

15

So I

And then if you frame it that way, I think

16

it makes perfect sense to treat the pre-divorce scenario

17

and the post-divorce scenario as parallel.

18

don't think that the goal of protecting disability pay

19

really has anything to do with the timing of the

20

disability relative to the divorce.

21

you have two disabled veterans and they're both

22

divorced, I think that their interest in keeping their

23

disability pay is the same, even if one of them happened

24

to become disabled the year before his divorce and the

25

other one happened to become disabled the year

Alderson Reporting Company

Because I

In other words, if

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

afterwards.

2

terms, I think the -- the purpose of arguments don't

3

distinguish between the pre-divorce and the post-divorce

4

scenario.

5

So I think that, you know, framed in those

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem is, really,

6

that when people are getting divorced and they already

7

know they can't divide up the disability pay, that the

8

courts have a full picture and can then determine

9

alimony and child custody with those factors in mind.

10

And we presume that, at the time of their divorce, this

11

woman was relying on a certain amount of income that

12

would be fixed for the rest of her life, and she planned

13

her life around that income.

14

act independent of her and not just reducing her income,

15

but with her reduction of income, he's also getting a

17

percent, a third more than she is by this unilateral

18

act.

19
20

And he has now taken an

So he's getting, you know, whatever, 20

In terms of policy, that is a substantially
different impact --

21

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well --- and one that, you

23

know, the government is taking the position that if

24

you're doing this post-divorce, you're changing the

25

nature of the policy.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I -- I think that all we're

2

asking for is for parallel treatment in the pre-divorce

3

context and the post-divorce context.

4
5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

But what I'm saying

to you, as a matter of policy, is that right?

6

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I think -I don't -- I mean, I

8

don't know the answer legally, but is -- there is a

9

difference in terms of what Congress might have expected

10
11

or not expected.
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, first of all, it's not

12

really clear to me that the policy interests are so much

13

stronger post-divorce than pre-divorce.

14

different, but I'm not sure they're stronger.

15

there's certainly a lot of equitable arguments in the

16

pre-divorce context.

17

spouses from longer marriages who often relied on the

18

disability pay during the marriage.

19

know, quit their job to care for their veteran spouse

the issues of alimony and -- and child support.

23

will get made up there.

24
25

I mean,

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Those

Well, then, that -- they may

get made up in alimony and child support, but there's --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

you know, the deprivation of property in that case has

2

it's own harshness.

3

Now, I think there's a difference --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the point is the

5

divorce court will know if he's already getting

6

disability pay, then her share of the pension will be so

7

much less.

8

can say, so I'm going to give her more of some other

9

property.

10

And with that knowledge, the divorce court

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So I don't think the divorce

11

court can do that in that context because then Mansell

12

would be essentially a dead letter.

13

the divorce court said, well, you know, this -- this

14

person waived his retirement pay and, you know, I don't

15

like that and so -- you know, I don't agree with the

16

Mansell rule, so I'm just going to increase the

17

equitable share to just balance out the waiver --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

20
21
22

Well --

-- we think they don't have

-CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The judge doesn't

have to say that.

23

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

In other words, if

Well, I mean -- I mean -Right?

I mean, the

alimony -- they're all -- there's not a set number that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

this has to be.

2

be a situation where we're certainly going to take into

3

account the whole picture.

4

perhaps unreasonable for the judge to say, well, I'm

5

going to look at everything in figuring out the amount

6

of alimony, but I'm not going to look at the fact that

7

he's getting, you know, disability pay.

8

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

9

And it seems to me that it -- it would

And I think it would be

That may be.

And so if a

court could do that before the decree, we also think the

10

court can do that after the decree.

11

that before the decree, the court couldn't just adjust

12

dollar for dollar to compensate for the waiver, because

13

that would essentially overrule Mansell.

14

court can't do that before the decree, we're just asking

15

for parallel treatment after the decree.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

All we're saying is

this, Mr. Unikowski, but you are making a distinction,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES W. WIRKEN

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19
20

MR. WIRKEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

21

The authority granted to the States by the

22

Former Spouses Protection Act to treat -- to treat

23

marital -- to treat Military Retirement Pay as property

24

and divide it necessarily operates at the time of the

25

divorce.

The text of the Act, its primary purpose to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

protect the former spouse, and the practical realities

2

of divorce make the time of divorce paramount.

3

when family courts must determine the extent of all of

4

the marital property, divide that property, and also

5

coordinate the multiple moving parts of a divorce, which

6

include spousal maintenance, which is often intertwined

7

with the division of property.

8
9

That is

Now, the authority to divide Military
Retirement Pay is limited only by the Act's exclusion of

10

amounts of retirement pay that are then being deducted

11

as the result of a previous waiver to receive disability

12

benefits.

13

divorce occurs before the member's retirement, as the

14

statute expressly allows, and, therefore, before any

15

waiver has occurred, or the division occurs after

16

retirement, the State law consequences of the property

17

division must follow along.

18

And whether that division at the time of

And those consequences can include the fact

19

that the -- in -- in a particular State that the

20

retirement pay awarded to a spouse is considered to be

21

that spouse's vested property.

22

consequential right of the State to formulate remedies

23

to protect and affect that property right, to compensate

24

for any damage that might be done to that property

25

interest.

And also, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

And another consequence I -- that I think

2

has come up here today is -- is that of the finality of

3

the divorce decree and whether the State court has the

4

ability to go back and modify -- after a waiver of

5

retirement pay in favor of disability pay, to go back

6

and modify a division of property.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MR. WIRKEN:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think -What --

I -What is the general

10

answer to that?

11

distinction between the finality of division of -- with

12

respect to property, as opposed to some other -- as

13

opposed to cash, I guess, or -- or income.

14

there that difference?

15

I mean, it -- I gather there's a

MR. WIRKEN:

Is -- is

I think the -- I think the

16

general answer, Your Honor, is that the a decree

17

dividing -- to the extent it divides property is final.

18

And for good reason.

19

there is a settlement agreement, as there was here, and

20

it then becomes incorporated into the divorce decree,

21

it's impossible, I would say, to go back and modify the

22

division of property.

And in Arizona, certainly when

23

You know, one of the objectives of family

24

law courts is to achieve finality and -- and not have

25

folks coming back in the future.

Certainly, child

support and spousal maintenance can be exceptions, but

2

there has to be a substantial and continuing change of

3

circumstances in order to justify revisiting, reopening,

4

modifying child support or spousal maintenance.

5

But property division is -- is thought to be

6

set in stone.

7

spouses are splitting the sheets and the Court must

8

determine how many sheets there are and how big they are

9

and decide who gets what.

At the time of divorce, the -- the

And what that is -- what is

10

decided at that point in time is what they have going

11

forward.

12

was -- that community property that was divided and then

13

becomes now the separate property of each of those

14

spouses.

15

And neither one can do anything to affect what

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

is the pension.

17

here be permissible?

18
19

Then would the family court's order

MR. WIRKEN:

I'm sorry.

Supposing that the

retirement is the only asset?

20
21

So suppose the only asset

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The retirement is the only

asset.

22

MR. WIRKEN:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

the family court's order here be proper?

MR. WIRKEN:

And your question is what?

Yes.

Then -- then what -- would

2

it's the only asset or not, it's certainly in that

3

hypothetical -- because her community property interest

4

has been transformed into her separate property interest

5

and then unilaterally damaged by the actions of her

6

ex-husband.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Whether

Well, how do you deal

8

with your adversary's position that her borrowing from

9

our prior case that the only reasonable expectation that

10

the Court or she could have had was that his military

11

pay was always subject to a potential deduction for

disability pay?

13

act tells anyone relying on military pay that it can, as

14

a matter of law, be changed by a disability award.

15
16
17
18

That's basically his argument, that the

MR. WIRKEN:

I disagree with my friend,

because -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know you do.

The

question is how and why.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. WIRKEN:

Well -- well, Congress gave the

21

States the right to treat this kind of property

22

according to State law.

23

along with that, when -- in a community property State

24

or in any State, whatever the property scheme may be,

25

the Court gets to divide what was then before the Court.

And, therefore, you know, going

Alderson Reporting Company

And in -- in this situation, there had been

2

no waiver whatsoever, and so the Court is looking at

at all of the assets in making -- and, by the way, it's

There is a disability.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

That's not what it

says in the statute.

illegal to treat disposable retired pay as property of

5

The statute in Subsection D(1)

has retired, and, therefore, before there could have

been any waiver and any disability benefits taken.

that you're saying well, you can't divide this, but you

position as if you'd divided this.

MR. WIRKEN:

same as if the law hadn't had any -- it has no practical

effect at all, I would think that's contrary to -- to

21

what the legislation was designed to accomplish.

22

MR. WIRKEN:

But you as a legislature

sitting across the street adopted this to protect that

spouse and to enable States to divide the retirement pay

25

as property according to State law at the time of the

divorce.

2

And -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then maybe I'm

3

the one who insisted on the part of the law that says

4

when it's disability, you don't get to divide that.

5

MR. WIRKEN:

If it has already been waived,

6

it cannot be divided.

But here, when she divorced, it

7

had not been waived.

There is no disability to divide,

10

fact that these parties made an agreement.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's --

11

concern for former spouses is certainly evident in the

12

Act, but as we've always said, no statute pursues its

13

purpose at all costs, and with obviously a different

14

purpose applicable with respect to the part of the law

15

that says you can't divide disability payments.

16

don't think you can resort to the purpose of the statute

MR. WIRKEN:

So I

But the primary purpose,

according to Congress, was to protect the -- the spouse.

Yeah.

And it's

22

subsidiary purpose was to do so in a way that preserved

disability payments and didn't allow them to be divided.

24
25

MR. WIRKEN:

To be divided.

But -- and I --

this is, again, a situation, a case in which there were

Alderson Reporting Company

no disability benefits to divide at the time of divorce

2

when her property rights were vested in her.

3

division of Military Retirement Pay is determined

according to State law at the time of divorce and that

an order remedying damage to such a share is not

preempted by the Act.

under your Honor's hypothetical, the answer is yes,

18

but --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

20

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Yes, but it is up to a

21

State court to determine --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

State court says yes.

24

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

23

Yes.

Yes.

Okay.

is, unfortunately, Congress lowers the amount.

half go down to the wife too?

3

MS. EISENSTEIN:

4

depends on State law. So --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does the

So, once again, under -- it

It depends on State law.

6

In other words -- in other words, if you say that 50

7

percent goes to the wife, 50 percent goes to the

8

husband, and you cut it, then more than 50 percent will

9

go to the wife.

10

MS. EISENSTEIN:

That's right, because -- so

11

let me be clear of what we think the role of the Spousal

12

Protection Act is.

13

The Spousal Protection Act instructs State

14

courts how to calculate the disposable retired pay

15

available for division, and otherwise puts disposable

16

retired pay on equal footing at any other civilian asset

17

so that it allows the State court to treat the

18

disposable retirement pay as any other marital property

19

in a variety of ways.

20

One is it can equitably divide those assets

21

in any way it sees fit, from zero to one hundred

22

percent.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose the statute, it

24

said, following Mansell, that the wife cannot have more

25

than 50 percent of the actual after tax income from

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

retirement.

2

Then can the State do it?
MS. EISENSTEIN:

The after tax income from

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

5

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, I think that the

3

retirement.

6

state could do, in terms of a remedy, is all they could

7

divide is the --

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'll tell you what.

There's a statute, a federal statute, says if taxes go

10

up, or if the payments are reduced for retirement, under

11

no circumstances can the wife obtain more than the

12

reduced -- half the reduced payment.

13

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Right.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then can the State

15

court do something about that?

16
17

So if they could --

MS. EISENSTEIN:

It couldn't if it limited

it to any other sources of income.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not keeping that out of

20

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Right.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm saying can the State

19

it.

22

just say, well, we don't care.

23

which says that we have to keep the wife's share at no

24

more than 50 percent.

25

There's a federal statute to that effect.

There is a state statute

But let's forget about that.

Alderson Reporting Company

We'll have

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

our State law.

2

Can't do that, can it?

MS. EISENSTEIN:

If I understand your

3

Honor's question, which is that there's only military

4

retirement pay, and the question is can the wife get

5

more than 50 percent share of it --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

In a state statute that

8

MS. EISENSTEIN:

The answer is no.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

10

MS. EISENSTEIN:

And that would be --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

So if that says no, then

7

says no.

12

why, if it goes down because of the choice of the

13

husband, who is protected in this choice by the

14

exception, why is that different.

15

MS. EISENSTEIN:

It's different because

16

there are other assets besides the military -- the

17

disability benefits used to satisfy the indemnification

18

order in this case, and so there's a very --

19
20

Is that the only

MS. EISENSTEIN:

I think that's a

difference?

21
22

JUSTICE BREYER:

significant difference.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

That's the only

24

difference.

25

cannot give the wife more than 50 percent of the

So in other words, if it says, no, you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

pension, then what they could do is have the decree, and

2

it says the wife gets 50 percent, gets -- sorry -- you

3

can't -- you cannot give them more than 50 percent --

4

I'm getting mixed up in my thing.

5

It says you can't give more than 50 percent,

6

and then there's a statute says you can't give -- you

7

can't give 60 percent, but the judge says, here's what

8

I'll do:

9

like to give you more than 60 percent so I'm going to

10

I'll give you 50 percent from this, and I'd

take 10 percent from something else.

11

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, I think that the

12

economic equivalent is not the only test, and that's the

13

test that Petitioner wants this court to adopt.

14

this Court needs to look at the legal basis for the

15

award.

16

I think

And as the discussion highlighted earlier,

17

there are many economically equivalent ways that a court

18

can reach the same division of property and total

19

financial transfer from one party to the other, some of

20

which are legal under this federal law and some of which

21

are not.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

that -- in other words, you're saying -- you're

24

basically saying there's no real substance to this law.

25

All the court has to do is find some charade to get to

Alderson Reporting Company

It seems to me

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

the same result.

2

I mean, would it be all right under your

3

view if they say, okay, you get 50 percent of -- all

4

the -- no disability payments yet.

5

of the retirement pay.

6

that there is disability pay -- there are disability

7

payments that result in a reduction of the military pay,

8

I appreciate that I cannot divide the disability pay,

9

but your share of the retirement pay is going to go up

You get 50 percent

Listen to me.

But in the event

10

as if we were dividing the disability pay.

11

or bad?

12

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Is that good

Well -- well, your Honor, I

13

think it -- it is -- it is okay to the extent that the

14

court is applying its generally applicable principles of

15

property division to treat the portion that is available

16

under federal law --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The court wants to

18

make sure that the spouse, whether wife or husband,

19

receives half of the military retirement pay, and

20

that -- and going forward.

21

does exactly what I set forth; says, okay, you're

22

entitled to half.

23

entitled to an additional amount exactly equal to half

24

of the disability pay.

25

So she does -- he or she

But if there's disability pay, you're

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

I think the

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

statute expressly contemplates fixed sum awards.

2

the -- the --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so

So you have a law

4

that says -- you have a law that says you can't divide

5

disability pay, and yet, you say it's okay to say, well,

6

I'm not going to divide it, but I'm just going to award

7

you an amount equal to what it would be if I divided it.

8

MS. EISENSTEIN:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let me be clear.
That's the sort of

10

thing that gives, you know, law a bad name.

11

just --

12

(Laughter.)

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14
15

It's

It makes a charade

out of the statute.
MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, your Honor, I

16

respectfully submit that State courts have a lot of

17

experience in treating differently separate property,

18

marital property, separate income, property interest.

19

That is the kind of bread and butter that State

20

courts -- those kind of distinctions are the bread and

21

butter that State courts apply their own state law to.

22

And so this Act --

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What does -- what

does that have to do with my question?
MS. EISENSTEIN:

So the question is, your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

Honor, in terms of the ability -- your Honor was

2

concerned that the State order could be a sham.

3

State courts are in the practice of treating as --

4

defining and treating as what is the quantum of marital

5

property and fairly applying those State rules.

6

But

So what the Spousal Protection Act does is

7

it throws to the State court the broad authority to

8

treat disposable retirement pay as marital property,

9

along with all of the civil assets.

Having made that

10

division and giving that broad authority to divide the

11

property, presumably it comes with the ability to

12

enforce that division.

13

property interests are presumably given the bundle of

14

rights that the State would normally give to protect it.

15

And assuming --

16

And the spouse's now separate

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

law does something else too.

18

disability payments.

Well, but again, the

It says you cannot divide

19

MS. EISENSTEIN:

20

pie that can be divided and shrinks it.

21

State courts how to allocate that benefit.

22

it comes to considering the role that disability

23

benefits play, we propose the rule should be that

24

disability benefits cannot be treated under the State

25

law as divisible property.

Right.

So that takes the
It doesn't tell

But it can be a

Alderson Reporting Company

And so when

Official - Subject to Final Review

44

consideration.

2

equitable division schemes, consider the separate --

3

And most State courts, under the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You know States --

4

consideration.

5

that the law prohibits, so long as we don't say it's

6

divided.

7

required military pay.

So we take half of it and add it to the

8
9

You say it can be divided, just in a way

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well -- well, your Honor,

we don't -- I don't interpret your Honor's hypothetical

10

as a division of property.

11

hypothetical as getting a contingent interest in other

12

property that may be available.

I interpret your Honor's

The work that --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

Whether it gets the additional amount from the

15

disability pay or from something else doesn't make a

16

difference.

17

MS. EISENSTEIN:

But money is money.

Well, your Honor, money

18

isn't money.

19

the broad discretion to allocate anywhere from zero

20

percent to one hundred percent of not only the -- the

21

civilian assets but the disposal retirement pay in the

22

first place.

23

When the State court originally had the --

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think the question is can

24

a State depart -- a -- a State court depart from the

25

rule that the State court would use in dividing property

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

solely for the purpose of making up for the fact that

2

the disability payment cannot be divided.

3

MS. EISENSTEIN:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

were saying they could do.

6

MS. EISENSTEIN:

No.

And so --

I thought that's what you

No, your Honor.

I think

7

that the court can use its broadly applicable rules for

8

enforcing existing property divisions; in this case, the

9

Arizona rule is one that prohibits a party from

10

unilaterally harming the interest of the other spouse,

11

and gives a makeup remedy.

12

protections that the Spousal Protection Act gives to

13

disability benefits.

14

anti-attachment provision -- this isn't the Spousal

15

Protection Act, other federal law, which is the

16

anti-attachment provision -- protects disability

17

benefits from any kind of award to satisfy a property

18

claim.

19

but it -- that -- in the event that there's only

20

disability benefits at issue, there is no relief.

But there's still important

No matter what, the

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

2
3

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

4

So I actually agree that finality in divorce

5

decrees is very important.

6

position is not trying to alter, sort of, ordinarily

7

applicable rules of res judicata.

8
9

And we're not -- our

But the question in this case is finality as
to what.

And we have an answer from the Arizona Supreme

10

Court.

11

what it did was it divided Petitioner's pension,

12

whatever it was.

13

have to accept as this case reaches the Court; that's a

14

state law interpretation which binds this Court.

15

The court interpreted the decree to say that

And that is a ruling that I think we

And so what the court held, however, is that

16

it was not going to enforce the decree as written.

17

was going to import a State law rule that basically says

18

that the relevant divisible asset was the total amount

19

of the retirement pay and divide that.

20

I think the court is quite clear.

It

It's

21

saying that it conceptualizes the property interests as

22

the total amount of money that Petitioner was receiving,

23

and it said that by waiving retirement pay, the

24

Petitioner converted a portion of respondent's property.

25

And so it's saying that Respondent holds a property

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

interest in half of that waived amount.

2

the same thing as treating waived retirement pay as

3

divisible.

4

So that's just

And so -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How consequential is the

5

issue before us?

6

future divorce settlements, they won't say half of the

7

Military Retirement Pay.

8

which is equal to what the Military Retirement Pay is

9

before any disability payment kicks in.

10

Because if you're right, then in all

They'll give a dollar amount

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, that might be

11

negotiated for consideration.

12

a lot of reported cases in which --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean, there's actually

What consideration?

I

14

mean, being aware of this possible diminution, the

15

lawyer for the -- for the spouse will say, I don't want

16

to get half of the MRP; I want to get a dollar amount

17

that's equivalent to what half of the MRP is right now.

18

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I mean, the veteran

19

doesn't have to agree to that.

20

is bilateral.

21

they'll just go to divorce court and there'll be a

22

decree where the court, we would say, would have to just

23

divide the retirement pay as mandated by Congress.

24
25

I mean, the settlement

And if the veteran doesn't agree, then

Now, we agree that settlements are good.
And there have been many reported cases where the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

veteran says, look, I'll -- I'll make you this promise

2

if you agree to give me, you know, the car or whatever.

3

So we're not -- we're not reading this statute as

4

impinging on settlements.

5

But in this case, the court held that what

6

the settlement was, was just dividing the pension

7

whatever it was 50-50.

8

required to pay this reimbursement order, it's not what

9

he had agreed to; it's this order imposed by State law

The fact that Petitioner is

10

saying that it was going to treat Respondent as holding

11

a property interest in half of the amount of the waived

12

retirement pay, which we think is -- is what the Federal

13

statute prohibits.

14

And in response to Justice Sotomayor's

15

question earlier, yes, I think that the reasonable

16

expectation is that the waivers might occur.

17

it's important to recognize that waivers of retirement

18

pay for disability are not rare or obscure.

19

hundreds of thousands of veterans who have done just

20

that.

21

experienced divorce lawyer that this might happen.

22

so during negotiations for a divorce settlement, this

23

may come up.

24

there's no way to predict this could conceivably happen,

25

I think, is just inconsistent with the reality of -- of

I think

There's

And I don't think it's a tremendous shock to an
And

So I just think the idea that, you know,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

divorce litigation in military divorces.

2

I'd like to respond to the -- the comments

3

of -- of counsel about other assets, that it's perfectly

4

fine to divide the accrual of disability pay as long as

5

there are just other assets used to fund it.

6

So first of all, I think that's quite

7

contrary to this Court's decision in Hillman and several

8

other cases.

9

think that the holding of those cases is that you can't

I think it's both counterintuitive, and I

10

do that, because just the four corners of the -- the

11

Hillman holding was that, you know, Federal law preempts

12

a statute that doesn't directly act on property, but

13

just has property go into a bank account and then is

14

transferred to the other bank account, which is

15

essentially the same situation as here.

16

And I think it's also quite pertinent that

17

what the statute says is that it's division of waived

18

retirement pay that's impermissible.

19

waived retirement pay literally is not money you're

20

getting.

21

literally is the money that you're not getting so you

22

can get disability pay.

23

waived retirement pay, what just that inherently means

24

is forcing you to pay an amount from your general assets

25

equal to that waived retirement pay to the other spouse.

And recall that

The definition of waived retirement pay

So when we talk about dividing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

So I just think that, you know, it's not even just

2

legalistic.

3

construed to permit operation on the general assets.

4

And I just want to make one other point.

I just think the statute cannot be

5

And, you know, Justice Sotomayor asked questions earlier

6

about sort of the policy distinctions between pre- and

7

post-divorce waivers.

8

there's no policy distinctions at all.

9

deny that.

And we're not denying that
I mean, we can't

Of course there are differences in policy.

10

And I think that the interest of the disabled veteran is

11

the same before and after.

12

distinctions at stake.

13

But there are policy

I think the question in this case is whether

14

this statute can be interpreted to recognize that those

15

policy distinctions and distinguished between those two

16

scenarios, and I just don't think you can't get it out

17

of the statutory text, which does prohibit waived

18

retirement pay from being treated as divisible no matter

19

when the waiver occurs.

20
21

If the Court has no further questions, I'll
rest.

Thank you.
