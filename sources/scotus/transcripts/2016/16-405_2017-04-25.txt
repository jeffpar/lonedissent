ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. TULUMELLO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. TULUMELLO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

The Montana Supreme Court concluded that

12

BNSF is subject to general personal jurisdiction in

13

Montana for two reasons:

14

First, it held that Montana State courts

15

exercise general all-purpose jurisdiction over BNSF

16

because BNSF does systematic and continuous business

17

activity in the State.

18

Second, it held that Section 56 of the

19

Federal Employers' Liability Act confers personal

20

jurisdiction on State courts.

21

Both conclusions were wrong.

22

First, under this Court's decision in

23

Daimler, BNSF is not subject to general personal

24

jurisdiction in Montana because it is not at home in

25

Montana.

Montana is not BNSF's principal place of

Alderson Reporting Company

business, nor its place of incorporation, and there is

2

nothing exceptional about BNSF's activities --

Now, I thought the --

14

Montana change this discussion?

15

17

MR. TULUMELLO:

It -- it doesn't, Your

It -- it doesn't.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Then if I, as an

18

individual, establish residency in multiple places, I

19

can be sued for all of my activities there, correct?

20

So why can't a corporation?

21

MR. TULUMELLO:

Your Honor, so the -- the

22

holding in Daimler was that even doing systematic,

23

continuous, sizable business would not be sufficient to

24

confer general personal jurisdiction.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I understand --

So if you treat a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

corporation like a person, which we seem to be doing,

2

why isn't their registration of an agent for purposes of

3

accepting service enough?

4

MR. TULUMELLO:

Well, if you treat the

5

corporation as a person, I think what this Court's due

6

process cases say is that you look for where the

7

corporation could be fairly regarded as at home.

8

would be equivalent to the personal domicile.

That

9

And in Daimler and Goodyear, this Court

10

suggested that the paradigmatic places would be the

11

principal place of business and the place of

12

incorporation.

13

part of a company's business activities, but it does

14

not, in and of itself, come anywhere close to subjecting

15

a corporation to general personal jurisdiction.

16

Registering to do business is simply one

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, there's an

17

argument -- there was an argument in the case we just

18

heard that -- that by registering, you effectively

19

consent to jurisdiction and consent is always a good

20

basis for.

21

MR. TULUMELLO:

It is -- it -- Your Honor,

22

I -- I think as -- I think with respect to consent, the

23

argument especially in this case that by registering to

24

business -- to do business in Montana law, BNSF

25

consented to any kind of jurisdiction is expressly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

negated by the text of the Montana statute, which says

2

registering to do business in and of itself does not

3

confer personal jurisdiction in this State.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, the --

5

the issue, I guess, was not addressed below and is not

6

before us.

7

MR. TULUMELLO:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Correct.
I'm looking at

footnote 1 in the government's brief.

10

MR. TULUMELLO:

Your Honor, so I -- I would

11

draw -- I would draw a distinction about how the

12

registration issue can play in this case.

13

registration as part of the overall level of activity

14

engaged in by the company, is that enough to make it at

15

home.

16

know, running trains through the State, that's not

17

enough to make it at home in Montana.

Clearly we think it cannot.

18

One is, is

Registration, you

There's a separate issue of whether

19

registration in and -- in and of itself is some sort of

20

implied consent to -- to be subject to general personal

21

jurisdiction, and the Montana Supreme Court didn't reach

22

that issue.

23

Supreme Court reached the truly unique and unprecedented

24

conclusion that Congress, in confirming the concurrent

25

subject matter of the State courts, meant for the first

So with respect to Section 56, the Montana

time to confer personal jurisdiction.
As this Court held in the Second Employers'

3

Liability Act cases, decided just two years after

4

Section 56 was enacted, Section 56 was designed to

5

abrogate Supreme Court of Connecticut's decision in

6

Hoxie, which had held that -- that -- that Congress in

7

FELA had tried to establish exclusive Federal court

8

jurisdiction over FELA claims.

9

concurrent jurisdiction clause in FELA, confirmed that

So Congress, in the

10

State courts retained concurrent subject matter

11

jurisdiction.

12

Concurrent subject matter jurisdiction is

13

also a term of art that has for 200 years, since the

14

Judiciary Act, and it's in the Judiciary Act, has been

15

understood to refer to subject matter jurisdiction and

16

not personal jurisdiction.

whether Congress could prescribe the Federal

11

12

example of that and it would raise some serious

13

federalism constraints and we also argue serious

14

Fourteenth Amendment constraints.

15

It's not something

There is no historical

In any event, FELA does not attempt to do

16

that.

17

contemporaneous decision in the Second Employers'

18

Liability Act made clear that Congress was not trying to

19

enlarge or regulate the jurisdiction of the State courts

20

or to control their modes of procedure.

21

consequences of trying to read a special venue statute

22

as containing a grant of personal jurisdiction would

23

really call into question what the 200 or odd-so special

24

venue statutes in the Federal code are doing, whether

25

they have some heretofore unknown grant of personal

9

thought that the general venue statute at that time was

Again, nobody

10

an independent source of personal jurisdiction.

11

Instead, the way that Congress speaks to Federal

12

personal jurisdiction is through changing the options

13

for service of process, and that was established in 1838

14

in the Tollen v. Sprodd case.

15

Robertson in 1925 when the Court actually explored the

16

difference between venue-type language and

17

jurisdictional-type language and cited specific

18

statutory examples of where Congress had expanded

19

Federal court jurisdictions.

20
21
22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It was reiterated in

Are -- are you saying that

service-of-process language is an absolute necessity?
MR. TULUMELLO:

I don't think it's an

23

absolutely necessity.

24

something about personal jurisdiction itself like in

25

current Rule 4.

The Court -- Congress could say

But I do think there must be some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

method prescribed by Congress as this Court said in

2

Omni.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Aren't there some statutes

4

that look like the first sentence of this statute that

5

have been read as personal jurisdiction requirements?

6

MR. TULUMELLO:

It -- I -- I -- Respondents

7

cite a couple post-Omni cases that infer service of

8

process provisions from statutes that set up -- you

9

know, agencies, and where the courts have held in those

10

circumstances that unless we infer some kind of subpoena

11

authority, the agency just, you know, won't be able to

12

get out -- get out the door or do its job.

13

But, by and large, as this Court said in

14

Omni -- I mean, this Court has never inferred a

15

service-of-process provision, and the Court in Omni

16

gave, you know, three very good reasons for why that

17

would be a bad idea.

18

don't want to presume that Congress doesn't know how to

19

do it.

20

benefit of, you know, better predictability.

21

and -- and third, that in light of the long tradition of

22

how Congress has spoken to -- to these issues, it would

23

be unwise for courts to get into the business of common

24

law rule making for establishing personal jurisdiction.

25

Congress knows how to do it and so

Second, that legislative rule making has the

JUSTICE ALITO:

And --

One of the amici supporting

Respondents says that adopting your position would

2

create chaos in the industry.

3

that?

4

MR. TULUMELLO:

What is your response to

I -- I think just the

5

opposite is true, Justice Alito.

6

would bring some predictability and some order to the

7

industry.

8

claims being filed in forums like Montana, and like

9

these cases where the plaintiffs are not from Montana,

Adopting our rule

Right now, it is a true wild west of FELA

10

none of the alleged negligence occurred in Montana, none

11

of the alleged injury occurred in Montana, and yet we're

12

still subject to suit there.

13

So FELA plaintiffs using specific

14

jurisdiction or general jurisdiction, but going to

15

forums that have a reasonable connection to the

16

litigation will, in fact, you know, bring order to this

17

area of the justice system.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what about someone

19

who's working very far -- routinely they work very far

20

from their home, they're injured very far from home,

21

what would your rule do to them?

22

MR. TULUMELLO:

The -- that -- that

23

individual would have specific jurisdiction in the place

where they were injured.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

14

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

15

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

16
17

MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

18

So there are two questions before the Court.

19

The Court said in Omni that in order to assert personal

20

jurisdiction, you have to have a statute or a rule

21

making the defendant amenable to service of process.

22

There's a question of, here, is it Section 56 or Montana

23

law.

24
25

We've explained why we think it's Montana law.
And then the second question is if they're

exercising service of process on Montana law, does -- is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

that general jurisdiction consistent with the standards

2

the Court set out in Daimler and Goodyear, and we don't

3

think it is.

4

So on -- particularly on the Section 56

5

question, because that's one where there's a strong

6

Federal interest in not having words that don't say

7

anything about service of process being interpreted to

8

in fact say something about service of process, we have

9

a first sentence that refers to venue only in Federal

10

courts, and then a second sentence referring to State

11

courts.

12

concurrent jurisdiction in the State courts.

13

But all it does is to clarify that there's

And we just don't see how you can get to

14

conferral of personal jurisdiction in the State courts,

15

especially when we know, very clearly from the

16

legislative record, that Congress was trying to solve

17

two particular problems, the first in the first sentence

18

with venue in Federal courts, and then the second in the

19

sentence -- second sentence with making sure that State

20

courts understood that they could hear these claims.

21

I think it is also noticeable, as

22

Petitioner's counsel suggested, that we have not -- we

23

are not aware of any example in which Congress has used

24

language of this type to confer personal -- or even more

25

explicit language to confer personal jurisdiction in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

State courts, and also, that even at the time, back in

2

1910, Congress knew how to confer personal jurisdiction

3

if it wanted to.

4

We gave examples in -- of the Clayton Act

5

from 1914 in our brief, the Credit Mobilier Act in

6

Petitioner's brief, and then these were also discussed

7

in the Robertson case from 1925.

8

knows how to do venue versus service of process.

9

has continued up through the Court's decision in Omni.

10

In that, Congress
That

So we just don't think that Section 56

11

should be interpreted to be the first statute -- statute

12

to do it, especially where the implication with respect

13

to the second question would be to say that a company

14

like BNSF is subject to general personal jurisdiction in

15

28 or more States.

16

If the Court's decisions in Goodyear and

17

Daimler mean anything, it's that that just can't be

18

correct.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The Respondents note

20

what we said in Daimler that, in addition to the State

21

of incorporation and the principal place of business,

22

there may be particular circumstances where another

23

And given

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

forget the number of employees -- why doesn't that fit

2

in that additional criteria?

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, the Court described

4

that category very narrowly as a place where the

5

contacts are not just that they are continuous and

6

systematic business contacts, but where they are so

7

significant that you consider the company at home there,

8

that it's like the company's domicile.

9

And the only court -- example that the

10

Court's given of that to this point is the Perkins case

11

where you have the company that actually relocated

12

during the war from the Philippines to Ohio.

13

they said that --

on a specific jurisdiction.

10

And so there would be personal
It would just be

as a fallback, a place where you couldn't just subject

the defendant to suit there for a claim arising out of a

you're present in both States in an almost equal amount,

shouldn't you feel that you're going to be hauled into

4

both places?

5

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, the difference between

6

being hauled into court for claims that arise out of or

7

are related to the context with the State, as opposed to

8

claims that are just any kind of possible claims.

think the reason that the Court talked about you being

So in somewhere where there is that kind of

relationship that the corporation has in terms of

21

for the corporation, like a person, where they're

domiciled, to have to answer for any type of claim.

23

if we're talking about somewhere that you -- that the

16

jurisdiction description.

17

So the -- the way this statute is written, it

MS. MURRAY:

Certainly, Justice Ginsburg, we

18

recognize that the -- the language, you know, "where

19

suit may be brought" appears in other statutes and has

20

been interpreted in that way.

21

should look at Section 56 as a whole.

22

of another statute that, in a single paragraph, has the

23

-- the same language that FELA does, where it has a --

24

it talks about where suits may be brought, it then goes

25

on to say that the jurisdiction of the State and Federal

But I think this Court

Alderson Reporting Company

We are not aware

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

courts would be concurrent, and then has some very

2

unusual --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

"Concurrent" usually

4

means that it's not -- it's a Federal claim, but it

5

could be adjudicated in State as well as Federal court.

6

That's what concurrent jurisdiction means.

7

MS. MURRAY:

Well, I -- we think, Your

8

Honor, in this context it is ambiguous, given -- if you

9

look at the statute as a package where it has the

10

"may" -- "may be brought" language, the "concurrent

11

jurisdiction" language, and then the very unusual

12

provision that actually prohibits removal of these

13

State -- of these Federal causes of action into Federal

14

court.

15

this Court is -- is troubled by the -- our reading of

16

concurrent jurisdiction as perhaps an unusual one, I

17

think I should be equally troubled by the -- the

18

illusory reading of Section 56 that BNSF would give it.

And I would say, you know, to the extent that

19

Because the -- at the time that Congress

20

amended FELA in 1910, it intended for workers not to

21

have to go to the place of incorporation of the company,

22

or to leave far from their homes in order to bring suit,

23

regardless of where they were injured.

24

is, I -- I think you can't think about this case if you

25

don't accept our reading of FELA as being fair because

Alderson Reporting Company

And the reality

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

workers could still get specific jurisdiction over the

2

railroads in a place close to their home.

3

not going to be the case for many of these workers.

4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's simply

Why is -- why is

that?

6

MS. MURRAY:

Well, I think Congress

7

recognized in 1910 the railroad industry is unique.

8

have, in many cases, workers traveling five, six, seven

9

hours, even to get to their starting work point where

You

10

they then travel farther away.

11

example, at Mr. Nelson, he is a resident of the State of

12

Montana.

13

And under BNSF's view, he would either have to go to

14

Washington, he'd have to go to Tarrant County, Texas, or

15

he could go to Delaware.

16

that Congress ever would have predicted, given the

17

language that it adopted in 1910.

18

was trying to do when it adopted that language.

19
20

So if you look, for

He was injured in the State of Washington.

That's simply not the outcome

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And what we know it

Then why didn't it say

the action could be brought at plaintiff's residence?

21

MS. MURRAY:

Well, it considered that, Your

22

Honor.

23

plaintiff's residence language is because industry said

24

we don't want to have to defend suit in the plaintiff's

25

residence if we're not doing business there.

And, in fact, it -- the reason it didn't have

Alderson Reporting Company

So the

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

doing business planning language, I think, was actually

2

seen as being more fair to defendants than just a

3

plaintiff's residence standard.

4

And the other thing that I would point out

5

on that -- that issue, is that in 1947, Congress, again,

6

considered adopting a different standard for Section 56.

7

It considered a plaintiff's residence standard, and it

8

rejected it, because it actually would have been used at

9

that point to narrow the scope of places in which

10

plaintiffs could have brought their suit.

11

Congress was presented with evidence that

12

plaintiffs were bringing suits similar to what our

13

clients have done here, where the only connection

14

between the suits and the State was the fact that the

15

defendant was doing business there --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I -- I haven't

17

looked at a route map, but BNSF, I assume, is doing

18

business in a lot of States.

19

plaintiffs, wherever they reside, wherever they are

20

injured, to sue in any one of those States, right?

21

MS. MURRAY:

And this would allow

That's correct, Your Honor.

22

And we think that that is what Congress intended, and

23

it's -- Congress knew that that was, in fact, happening

24

in 1947 --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

Even though the

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

injury -- even though the injury occurred somewhere

2

else.

3

MS. MURRAY:

That's correct.

And I think it

4

is because of the unique nature of the railroad

5

industry.

6

You have -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not the unique

7

nature of particular forums?

8

discussion in the briefs is that there is a reason that

9

someone, not a resident of Montana, injured in

I mean, the -- the

10

Washington, would want to sue in Montana.

11

something we ought to take into consideration?

12

MS. MURRAY:

Is that

Well, I -- I think you can take

13

it into consideration, but I actually think it, in many

14

ways, favors us.

15

someone would want to bring suit in Montana, even if

16

they weren't injured there, even if they're not a

17

resident.

18

lot of these cases brought in Montana.

I -- there are good reasons why

I mean, I think as BNSF concedes, there are a
And --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

good reason they would want to sue in Montana?

21

MS. MURRAY:

What's -- what's the

Well, from a litigant's

22

perspective, if you want predictability, you want to

23

know that the court that you're going to knows the

24

specialized area of law like the back of their hand,

25

that is Montana.

These judges know FELA cases because

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

they see a lot of them.

2
3

So I -- I think there is good reason for
some --

4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That seems -- that

seems a little circular.

6

MS. MURRAY:

Well, but it is the practical

7

reality, in terms of -- of where people are bringing

8

suits.

9

cases are being brought in the State of Montana.

I would say it's not the case that all of these
I

10

mean, I think BNSF and its amici certainly try to make

11

that portrayal, but we don't have any hard data about

12

that.

13

represent FELA plaintiffs, they bring them lots of

14

different locations, including, you know, other

15

locations where people are not injured.

16

the matter is the railroad is just doing business there.

And certainly in speaking with attorneys who

And the fact of

17

The other thing I would say is that, you

18

know, whether you're concerned about people bringing

19

suit in the State of Montana, if you were to say that

20

our clients could not bring suit here, it would also

21

mean that those clients who want to bring suit in their

22

home State, again, in many instances, are not going to

23

be able to do that.

24
25

As to the specific jurisdiction question, I
think, you know, we are in agreement that people could

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

bring suit in the State where they were injured, but I

2

actually think that the analysis of specific

3

jurisdiction beyond that State gets quite complicated

4

pretty quickly.

5

person, for example, primarily working in their home

6

State.

7

these -- these workers do not primarily work in their

8

home States.

You know, it would depend on, is this

And the nature of this industry is many of

They may rarely, if ever, work there.

9

So in -- under those circumstances, I think

10

it is -- you know, it's certainly not what Congress had

11

in mind when it adopted the statute and said, you know,

12

by -- by adopting this statute, we are going to make

13

sure that people can find the defendant at any point or

14

place or State along the railroad's tracks and there

15

bring their actions.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I could understand why

17

Congress -- I could understand why they might have

18

wanted to allow the injured worker to sue where the --

19

where the injury occurred, or where the worker resides,

20

or where the company is headquartered, but why they

21

would want to allow a -- a suit in -- in a State that

22

satisfies none of those, really, is hard to understand.

23

MS. MURRAY:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I think

24

it is actually easier to understand if you sort of set

25

it in the context of what was going on at that time.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

The railroads -- there were thousands of these injuries.

2

And I think Congress recognized, you know, these are

3

highly sophisticated interstate transportation

4

companies.

5

lot more easily than injured workers who may have to

6

travel three States over to get to the --

7

They can get to these places of litigation a

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, I know.

And that

8

would -- you could say that would justify saying --

9

provide a reason for saying you could sue where you

10

live, you could limit it to those -- to only those

11

States where they're doing business.

12

say you can sue anywhere has nothing to do with either

13

the -- either the person who's injured or the company

14

or -- or the -- or where the injury occurs, really, it's

15

hard to understand going forward.

16

MS. MURRAY:

Well, I -- I do think it is the

17

language that Congress chose.

18

too, with respect to the --

19

But why you would

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I -- I would say,

With respect to that, I

20

mean, we did have -- we say different things in

21

different cases, but I think Kepner -- Kepner typed

22

Section 56, a venue provision, didn't it?

23

MS. MURRAY:

Certainly this -- this Court

24

has referred to the provision as a venue provision.

25

don't think that's inconsistent with our position

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

because, as we concede, we think the first sentence

2

does, in fact, confer both venue and personal

3

jurisdiction in Federal court.

4

inconsistent.

5

So it's not

I would point, Your Honor -- I think, you

6

know, the -- perhaps the -- the best cases, in terms of

7

support for our position, are the Pope and the Boyd

8

cases.

9

this where someone brought suit in a State court that --

So Pope, you had a situation very similar to

10

where the injury had not occurred.

11

was the railroad was doing business there.

12

case, this Court said this, Section 56, quote,

13

"establishes Petitioner's right to sue in Alabama.

14

provides that the employee may bring his suit wherever

15

the carrier, quote, 'shall be doing business,'" end

16

quote.

17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MS. MURRAY:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

And in that

It

What -- what year is that

case?

19

21

The only connection

I'm sorry?
What year is the Pope

case?
MS. MURRAY:

It was 1953.

So it's post

23

International Shoe.

24

talked about it at page 29 of our response, where the --

25

the Court has clearly staked out a position that the

And this is a case -- we just -- we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

doing-business language in the first sentence of Section

2

56 applies to State courts.

3

that you can make sense of that is to read Section 56 in

4

the way that we do, that takes the personal jurisdiction

5

conferred by sentence --

6

And I think the only way

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you have any -- any

7

example of any other statute that does what you claim

8

this one does, that is, that -- that determines State

9

court jurisdiction, that has a provision, which you say

10

is conferred, that alters the personal jurisdiction of

11

the State court from what it would be without the

12

Federal statute?

13

MS. MURRAY:

So the -- as I said, we don't

14

have a statute that we think mirrors FELA.

15

it's an unusual statute that was called for by unusual

16

circumstances.

17

U.S.C. 77b, it's part of the Securities Act, and that

18

statute does actually have an express service-of-process

19

provision with respect to Federal courts.

20

We do think

Probably the closest example is 15

It also has a concurrent jurisdiction

21

language in it.

22

lower courts, been interpreted -- or there's a

23

disagreement among the lower courts as to whether that

24

language actually provides or permits State courts to

25

exercise personal jurisdiction to the same extent as

And it has, in fact, in at least some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

Federal courts would as well.

2
3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Pope didn't mention personal jurisdiction at all.

4

MS. MURRAY:

5

don't think -- we're not arguing --

6
7

That's right, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We

And that's your

strongest authority?

8
9

The -- the Court in

MS. MURRAY:

Well, I think it is one.

I

certainly think the Boyd case, again, another -- this

10

one is -- we talk about at pages 31 to 31 -- 32 of our

11

brief.

12

we're not arguing it's a personal jurisdiction case, but

13

it was a case in which this Court read Section 56,

14

including sentence 2 of Section 56, to confer what it

15

called a substantial right, but under another provision

16

of FELA which prohibits any contract, the intent of

17

which is to exempt the carrier from liability.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The Boyd case is another example where, again,

The right that --

19

the right, I think, they're referring to, is the right

20

to proceed in State court, right?

21

MS. MURRAY:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

MS. MURRAY:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

That's correct, yes.
Which --

That's --- which, of course,

you'd expect that to deal with the second sentence,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

because it talks about the concurrent jurisdiction.

2

There's a difference between, you can proceed in State

3

court and the question of whether there's personal

4

jurisdiction in a particular State court.

5

MS. MURRAY:

Well, I -- I take your point,

6

Your Honor, but, I think, we don't typically think of a

7

provision that just says there's concurrent jurisdiction

8

between State and Federal courts and is referring only

9

to subject-matter jurisdiction.

Certainly in the

10

circumstances like this, where Congress, you know,

11

thought that there was this jurisdiction before and it

12

just wanted to -- to be extra sure to confirm it --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

We

14

don't -- we don't typically think of concurrent State

15

and Federal jurisdiction to refer to subject-matter

16

jurisdiction?

17

MS. MURRAY:

No.

What I was going to say is

18

we don't typically think of provisions like that as

19

conferring a substantial, non-waivable right.

20

think the -- the Boyd case certainly in terms of looking

21

at what is Section 56 doing, if all it is doing is

22

saying that you can bring a -- a cause of action in

23

Federal court in certain venues and just reconfirming

24

that State courts have subject-matter jurisdiction, you

25

wouldn't normally think of that.

Or it seems

Alderson Reporting Company

And so I

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

difficult --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wasn't there -- wasn't

3

there a decision that suggested that State courts didn't

4

have concurrent -- concurrent jurisdiction and that's

5

why Congress made the change?

6

MS. MURRAY:

There was, Your Honor.

And we

7

don't take issue with the -- the proposition from BNSF

8

that that is one thing that Congress was doing with the

9

concurrent jurisdiction language.

It was -- it was

10

confirming that State and Federal courts both had

11

subject-matter jurisdiction.

12

given the precedent, given Boyd and Pope, you're not

13

writing on a blank slate in terms of how you interpret

14

Section 56.

15
16
17

But we think given --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
mention personal jurisdiction.
MS. MURRAY:

No.

Well, Pope didn't

Did Boyd?
These are not personal

18

jurisdiction cases, but I do think the rationale that

19

they used in interpreting Section 56 necessarily -- when

20

you look at what Section 56 is doing, I -- I think you

21

do have to recognize it is doing something more than

22

what BNSF says it is doing.

23

that the language of doing business in sentence 1

24

applies to sentence 2 somehow, or applies to State

25

courts somehow, and we think that sentence 2 provides

And -- and through Pope,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

that necessary link.

2

If I -- if I could talk briefly about our

3

alternative argument, you know, if this Court were to

4

read FELA not to permit State courts here to exercise

5

personal jurisdiction, we do think that under this

6

Court's determination in Daimler and the preceding

7

precedent that there could be general jurisdiction here

8

as well, given the nature of BNSF's contacts with the

9

State of Montana.

10

And I think one key in that analysis -- or

11

one way to frame that analysis is to really look at

12

railroads as being unique.

13

instance of BNSF and Montana, you have, again, a very

14

sophisticated interstate commerce company that has, in

15

fact, been in Montana, through its predecessors, has

16

been engaged there before Montana was even a State, and

17

helped to populate the State by bringing in farmers and

18

ranchers.

There's some of the history of this in the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, is your argument that

21

railroad companies are so unique that they should be

22

subject to general jurisdiction everywhere?

23

MS. MURRAY:

I don't think that that would

24

necessarily have to follow, but I think it is a key

25

ingredient as to why BNSF is at home in the State of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Montana.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, I mean, at home in the

3

State of Montana and at home in everyplace else that it

operates?

5

MS. MURRAY:

I -- Your Honor, I think it

6

would depend on the other States in which it operates

7

and its history in -- in those States, the level of

8

contacts.

9

history, if you look at present day, BNSF has a gigantic

10

footprint in Montana.

11

States in which it operates.

12

roughly 2100 miles of track, 2200 employees in the

13

State, more than 40 facilities in the State, a permanent

14

presence that crisscrosses the State --

15
16

That's not true in all of the
It has over 2100 miles,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And there is

something --

17

MS. MURRAY:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- and has for decades.
I understand the

19

notion that railroads -- for those reasons, they

20

obviously have to have a lot of physical plant, they

21

have to have a lot of workers, they, you know, traverse

22

the State.

23

they're at home.

24

industries that have a significant impact.

25

know, there are interstate banks, airlines.

I understand how that might look like
But there are a lot of other

Alderson Reporting Company

I don't
I suspect

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

that there are agricultural companies that do a lot of

2

business and cover a lot of land and territory.

3

I mean, is your -- your test just that it's

4

a railroad, or -- or how do you decide what other

5

companies and industries are at home in Montana?

6

MS. MURRAY:

Well, sir, we are not arguing

7

for a standard that would sweep beyond railroads here.

8

I think there could be aspects of other industries that

9

would lend themselves to the same types of analysis.

10

But I -- I think that railroads actually are in a pretty

11

unique segment of interest -- industry in the sense of

12

unlike interstate or international banks, you know, you

13

depend on railroads to have a permanent physical

14

presence in the State, because, otherwise, you cannot

15

actually, you know, guarantee that you can carry goods

16

from one point of the country to another.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

companies?

19

goods, too.

20

Trucking companies, they carry a lot of

MS. MURRAY:

And they can go in many

21

different routes, Your Honor.

23

So trucking

I think here where you

No, no.

I mean,

24

they're going to take -- what is it? -- 95 across -- not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so I-80 across

7

8

They're going to, just like the railroad, is going to

follow the railroad tracks.

Maybe it's 90.
The truckers are

going to follow I-80.

Well, they're -- they're still

14

not going to have that same sort of permanent physical

15

presence in the State of laying down 2100 miles of

17

The other thing that I would point out with

18

respect to BNSF's role in the State of Montana, I think

19

to Justice Sotomayor's question about the registration,

20

we do have an alternative argument with respect to

21

consent, but we have all along also argued that the --

22

the registration, the longtime doing of business in

23

Montana should -- should play a role and is distinct

24

from some of the -- the cases that this Court -- Court

25

has had before it in the past.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

And, you know, one other thing to note,

2

which, I think, is, again, distinct from -- including

3

Daimler, what we know here about BNSF is that it is so

4

integrated into Montana's economic and political life,

5

it set up its own government relations shop in the State

6

of Montana.

7

its interests.

It's got lobbyists there to advocate for

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, I'm sure a lot

of other companies have government relations offices in
the State.

11

MS. MURRAY:

Well, that may be true, Your

12

Honor.

13

you are looking at various factors that could lead you

14

to conclude that BNSF is at home in the State of

15

Montana, I think that is one factor that plays a role

16

into it.

17

cases, for example, with, you know, foreign companies

18

that are being dragged into court because their products

19

happen to -- to land in that State.

20

company that has a permanent physical presence and it's

21

got lobbyists there who are looking out for its

22

interests if it doesn't like what is happening in the

23

courts of Montana or the substantive law to which it is

24

subjected in Montana.

25

brought in a district in which the defendant shall be

4

doing business?

5

MS. MURRAY:

No, Your Honor.

If I

6

understand your hypothetical, if we were to bring -- if

7

this Court decided that FELA did not address personal

8

jurisdiction at all, what would happen if we tried to

9

bring our suits in Montana Federal court is that that

10

Federal court would say, great, you have venue, but I

11

look to Rule 4 for personal jurisdiction --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

That's assuming we reach

that issue.

14

MS. MURRAY:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.

I suppose if this -We could just say

16

it's -- we could just say it doesn't apply to State

17

courts, it only applies to Federal courts.

18

MS. MURRAY:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MS. MURRAY:

You could.
Whatever it does.

You could, Your Honor.

I think

21

that that would be, you know, certainly preferable for

22

us if there is still some availability of Federal court.

23

One thing that I would note, however, is that would sort

24

of create a topsy-turvy scheme.

25

enacted FELA, it assumed that most of these suits would

I think when Congress

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it would take care

of the question of the -- of where a plaintiff lives.

It would take care of the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And, counsel, I -- I must

apologize.

It's 90 across Montana.

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

80 across Wyoming.

I'm

very sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

(Laughter.)

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

(Laughter.)

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Didn't I say 90?

Anyway, your problem, I

16

guess, that you're trying to get around is that Daimler

17

had about 2.4 percent of its world sales in California

18

and was the largest seller of luxury goods in

19

California, luxury cars.

20

luxury cars in California, it's really something.

And I suspect when you sell

21

MS. MURRAY:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, certainly -They had a very big market.

23

And the problem is how do you get around that?

24

and I know you're trying, and it's a -- making a valiant

25

effort and so forth, but -- but I don't really see the

Alderson Reporting Company

And --

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

difference.

2

MS. MURRAY:

Well, Your Honor, we hope it's

3

more than a valiant effort in the sense that we do think

4

that there are key distinctions not just in the numbers

5

here in terms of the track and employees and business,

6

but in terms of the nature of the industry --

7
8

JUSTICE BREYER:

What percent -- what

percent of their total operation is in Montana?

9

MS. MURRAY:

We know that they get up to

10

10 percent of their revenue in the State of Montana,

11

which, given that they operate in 28 States and a couple

12

Canadian provinces, it has to be the case that that is

13

disproportionately large compared to the other States in

14

which they operate.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MS. MURRAY:

Good point.

And -- and if -- if I could

17

come back to -- to your question, Justice Sotomayor,

18

about if -- if plaintiffs were able to bring these

19

claims in Federal court versus State, that would

20

certainly be preferable.

21

bring it --

22

Then they -- they couldn't

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that would -- that

23

would depend on it being it's a personal jurisdiction

24

provision, not just a venue provision.

25

MS. MURRAY:

That's -- that's correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If it's a venue

2

provision, which this Court said it was, then you -- you

3

satisfy the venue requirement, but not personal

4

jurisdiction.

5

MS. MURRAY:

That's right, your -- Your

6

Honor, and I -- what would happen in that case is that

7

Mr. Nelson, for example, living in North Dakota, would

8

be headed to Washington, Texas, or Delaware to bring his

9

claim.

That would be the reality, despite what Congress

10

intended when it adopted and it -- or amended FELA in

11

1910.

But in --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

his state of residence?

14

MS. MURRAY:

But what is -- what is

He is a North Dakota resident.

15

And -- and was injured, you know, in -- in the State of

16

Washington.

17

workers frequently travel in order to bring their -- or

18

frequently travel in the course of their -- their work

19

for BNSF, it, in many ways, is simply a coincidence

20

whether they're injured at home versus injured somewhere

21

else, and of course, they would have no way of knowing

22

that in advance.

23

Again, I think an example of how far these

But I -- I would say with respect to

24

bringing suit in Federal court, I don't think it would

25

completely solve the problem in this sense.

Alderson Reporting Company

You know,

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

when Congress thought these cases would be brought in

2

State court, it didn't want them removed -- or, at least

3

where plaintiffs chose to file them in State court, it

4

did not want them to be removable.

5

that is because these are personal injury cases.

6

of them are low -- low-dollar claims.

7

8

with respect to, you know, if you want to take this kind

of claim to a State court judge for whom this is the

And I think part of
Some

Congress wanted

10

bread and butter of their docket, you can do that.

11

I think if you were to -- to limit these types of claims

12

to Federal court in Montana, for example, or on the

13

doing-business rationale, one, plaintiffs would still be

14

very limited in terms of where they could choose State

15

courts, but it also wouldn't be as easily accessible to

16

them.

17

have one or two in a State, and so it's not going to be

18

as readily available of a forum for injured workers who,

19

you know, certainly as compared to the railroads, are

20

going to be far more burdened by a rule like that.

21

And

I mean, most of the time, Federal courts you only

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Ms. Murray, one of the

22

rationales that Montana relied on was that Daimler

23

applied only to foreign corporations, and I didn't see

24

the briefs really grapple or attempt to defend that.

25

Do you -- do you concede that that's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

erroneous?

2

MS. MURRAY:

We don't -- we think the way

3

that the Montana Court framed it, I think, is not a

4

helpful one to think about it.

5

What -- what I would say is this:

I don't

6

think that you can simply say Daimler doesn't apply

7

because it was a foreign corporation.

8
9

But I do think Daimler, as earlier general
jurisdiction cases had recognized, continued to

10

recognize the nature of context matters.

11

certainly, I think once you start moving up the

12

corporate chain, once you start hopping into other

13

continents and having to impute -- to the extent that

14

that is actually appropriate -- having to impute

15

contacts of a subsidiary, I think the nature of the

16

contacts becomes so attenuated, that at that point that

17

transnational element of Daimler actually does play a

18

role; it's just not a dispositive one.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. TULUMELLO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1
2

MR. TULUMELLO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

3

Just a couple points.

First, the Montana

4

Supreme Court held that it did not need to apply this

5

Court's decision in Daimler based on Daimler's

6

transnational facts and because BNSF is a domestic

7

railroad.

We think neither rationale is persuasive.

8
9

And at least with respect to railroads being
unique, we don't read these -- this Court's due process

10

cases as saying due process protection depends on the

11

particular line of business that you're in.

12

There are -- you know, as to movement and

13

ownership of property, there are many industries, cable

14

companies, agriculture businesses, and so forth, that

15

have physical plants and that transport people across

16

the country.

17

And then with respect to FELA, we don't

18

think it would be helpful or faithful to the text or

19

legislative history to interpret Section 56 in a way

20

that grants personal jurisdiction when no other special

21

venue statute or general venue statute has ever done so.

22

So we respectfully ask that the Montana

23

Supreme Court judgment be reversed.

24

Thank you.
