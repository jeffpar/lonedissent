ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. GUPTA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about whether the State may

12

criminalize truthful speech that merchants believe is

13

their most effective way of communicating the hidden

14

cost of credit cards to their customers.

15
16
17

By design, New York's law suppresses the
message that you pay more -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

I -- I --

18

you're two groups of -- of Petitioners.

19

just give a cash price without any information about the

20

surcharge, and the other, I thought, wanted to give two

21

separate prices.

22

truthful information about the surcharge.

One wants to

So not everybody doesn't want to give

23

MR. GUPTA:

24

They all want to do the same thing.

25

think what you're referring to is that some of them are

No -- well, they do, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

They -- they -- I

doing different things now.
One of the Petitioners, Expressions Hair

3

Design, is engaging in dual pricing, they're charging

4

two different prices, one for cash, one for credit, but

5

they are trying as hard as they can to describe that as

6

a -- as a discount so that they comply with the law.

7

The other Petitioners right now are

8

refraining from dual pricing altogether, because they

9

don't want to run the risk of -- of failing to comply

10

with this regime.

11

Petitioners would like to charge two different prices

12

for cash or for credit, and they would like to be able

13

to characterize the price difference as a surcharge for

14

using a credit card.

But if we win this case, all of the

16

understood, but your adversary can tell me.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's not what I

Mr. Gupta, what -- what

speech precisely do you think is being restricted?
MR. GUPTA:

The -- the message that when you

20

use a credit card, you're paying more, and to be more

21

precise, I think if you look at Joint Appendix 103

22

through 104, you'll find there the supplemental

23

declaration of Expressions Hair Design where they say

24

exactly what they'd like to do.

chart.

2

the pastrami sandwich as $10, and then tell you that

3

it's going to cost a certain percentage more, 2 percent

4

more, to pay with a credit card.

And what we'd like to do, ideally, is describe

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess that's why I

6

said like what speech precisely, and you said the

7

message that you're going to pay more if you use a

8

credit card.

9

MR. GUPTA:

10

Right.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, you know, as -- this --

11

this statute is not written in terms of speech, it's --

12

it's written in terms of imposing a surcharge.

13

and let's say that somebody -- let's say that there is a

14

merchant and the merchant charges the list price for

15

something as a dollar and the person comes up to the

16

cash register and offers a dollar bill.

17

MR. GUPTA:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And --

Uh-huh.
And -- and the cashier says,

19

oh, no.

20

surcharge for people who use credit cards; right?

For you it's 95 cents because I impose a

21

MR. GUPTA:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23
24
25

Uh-huh.
Now, would that violate this

law?
MR. GUPTA:

I -- you know, I don't know, and

what -- part of the difficulty is -- and the reason, we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

have a vagueness challenge --

2
3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You don't know?

How would

it violate the law?

4

MR. GUPTA:

I don't think -- I don't think

5

it would.

6

State hasn't taken that position --

I don't think it would.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

MR. GUPTA:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And certainly the

You don't think it would.

I don't think it would.
Even though you're

10

describing something as a surcharge.

11

reason it wouldn't violate the law is because the

12

conduct is, you know -- it -- it fits the law, right,

13

that essentially you're not imposing a surcharge on

14

credit card users.

15

describe it, you're not imposing a surcharge on credit

16

card users.

17

Because -- the

Whatever you call it, however you

MR. GUPTA:

Well, I think the way this law

18

works is that you can engage in precisely the same

19

conduct.

20

for cash, one for credit, and what -- what runs afoul of

21

the law is describing the price difference one way as a

22

surcharge versus a credit, and you know that --

23
24
25

You can charge the two different prices, one

See, that's what you keep --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- and I think my

2

hypothetical was designed to show that that's just not

3

right.

I mean, I can imagine ways in which you

5

might say that this is restricting speech, but that's

6

not it.

7

higher price, is the price that a credit card company

8

has to pay, as long as that's true, you can describe it

9

any which way you please.

Because as long as the price listed is the

And you can describe it in

10

terms of impose -- of -- of imposing a surcharge or

11

charging credit card customers more, and it still is not

12

going to violate this law.

13

MR. GUPTA:

I -- I don't think so,

14

Justice Kagan, and I think in your hypothetical --

15

the -- it -- in your hypothetical, the merchant hasn't

16

telegraphed to the consumer at the same time the two

17

prices, right?

18

engage in.

19

That's not what our clients want to

If -- if New York wants to continue to

20

enforce this statute against deceptive practices or

21

false advertising, we have no problem with that.

22

is an as-applied challenge, and the merchants in this

23

case want to engage in truthful speech.

24

disclose more.

25

This

They want to

They want to --

JUSTICE BREYER:

They want to do more.

Alderson Reporting Company

They

want to impose a surcharge.

2

MR. GUPTA:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

No -Then what's the problem

4

with saying -- you -- you don't -- you're too young to

5

know what the OPA was.

6

MR. GUPTA:

7

I think -- I think so, Justice

Breyer.

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

It's called the Office of

Price Administration.

11

MR. GUPTA:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Ken Galbraith ran it for

13

awhile.

14

is they'd go around and they'd smell what the right

15

price was.

And they would -- what they would do, he said

16

MR. GUPTA:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

Mm-hmm.
And after they said that in

World War II, you couldn't charge a higher price.

19

Would you have come in and said, Ken

20

Galbraith says you can only charge $13 for this item.

21

It violates our free speech.

22

MR. GUPTA:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Absolutely -Because we want to charge

$15.
MR. GUPTA:

Absolutely not, Justice Breyer.

I grant you, all business activity takes place

MR. GUPTA:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

got to do with speech.

13

MR. GUPTA:

Right.
So explain to me what it's

And I agree, if you look at this

statute, it doesn't scream First Amendment probably --

15
16

And you want to.

I --

10

14

Very

JUSTICE BREYER:

Not only doesn't it scream

it, I want to know --

17

MR. GUPTA:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Unless you want to say

19

whenever a businessman is regulated in what he can do,

20

or she --

21

MR. GUPTA:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Mm-hmm.

Right.

-- that violates the First

23

Amendment or at least potentially because they do it

24

through speech.

25

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

But this is a regime

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

that says you are allowed to call it a surcharge, you

2

just can't call it a discount.

statute.

5

charge a surcharge.

I don't see that in the

My statute that I'm reading says you can't

6

MR. GUPTA:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

And the enforcement --

Well -But you can charge a

discount.

9

Now, I know, Paul MacAvoy, I hate to bring

10

up these long-gone names, but he was an economist with

11

whom I wrote a book.

12

said, that, well, a discount and a surcharge are the

13

same thing economically.

And he would have said what you

14

MR. GUPTA:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
But we live in a world that

16

not everybody is an economist, and many people think

17

it's quite a different thing, and there are a lot of

18

studies in this thing that the -- you know, that said it

19

was a different thing.

20

MR. GUPTA:

That's what they can't do.
Certainly -- right.

Certainly

21

consumers react to the way price information is

22

communicated --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

the regular price.

25

it's a surcharge.

Not in the way -- you have

If you go above the regular price,
If you go below the regular price,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1
2

it's a discount.
MR. GUPTA:

But in this case, both sides

3

agree the way the regular price is -- is defined is in

4

relation to how you communicate that.

5

of the red brief.

6

how it's communicated.

7

Look at page 28

They define regular price based on

I think both sides come to this case with

8

two propositions that they agree on.

9

the regulation of prices, the kind of price regulation

We all agree that

10

you're talking about, Justice Breyer, is economic

11

conduct that doesn't implicate First Amendment concerns.

12

We also agree -- we also all agree and know from

13

Virginia Board that communicating price information to

14

consumers is protected by the First Amendment and is at

15

the heart of the commercial speech doctrine.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

MR. GUPTA:

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I go back to --

Plus --- Justice Kagan's

19

hypothetical.

20

dual prices are posted, but it addresses a situation

21

where there is a dual-price regime.

22

going to pay more; some consumers are going to pay less.

It doesn't address the situation where

23

MR. GUPTA:

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

Some consumers are

Right.
And in her hypothetical, she

says the sticker price is the higher price.

Alderson Reporting Company

And then

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

when the cash purchaser comes to the cash register, the

2

purchaser gets a pleasant surprise.

3

to be charged less.

4

No, you are going

But I thought your argument was that this --

5

if that is the correct interpretation of the statute,

6

and -- and I don't really know what the statute means

7

and we don't have a definitive interpretation.

8

that is the correct interpretation of the statute, what

9

New York State has done is to force the merchant to

But if

10

say -- to post a particular sticker price -- namely, the

11

higher sticker price -- as opposed to the lower sticker

12

price.

13
14
15

So that is mandated speech.

Isn't that your

argument?
MR. GUPTA:

I think if New York -- it's not

16

mandated speech in the sense they haven't told us

17

precisely what to say.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, under that

19

interpretation, if it's okay to post the higher price

20

and nothing more, and if the higher price is the credit

21

card price, they are -- they are forcing the merchant to

22

speak in a particular way.

23

MR. GUPTA:

I think what they are doing

24

is -- they are -- they are forcing the merchant to speak

25

in a particular way in the sense that you have to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

characterize the price difference a certain way in order

2

to comply with the statute.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Gupta, this exchange --

4

I mean, I think that these are two very different

5

theories of what makes this a speech restriction.

6

guess the reason I asked my question was because Justice

7

Alito's theory does not appear to be your theory, and I

8

want to know which theory we're really talking about

9

here.

10

And I

Justice Alito's theory is that when the

11

legislation says you have to post the higher price, that

12

that in itself is a restriction on speech.

13

an interesting argument, and maybe he's right about

14

that.

15

And that's

I don't know.
Now, your brief took a different position.

16

Your brief essentially said the problem is that this --

17

this -- this legislation affects the way a cashier or

18

somebody in a store -- just affects -- it affects the

19

way they describe transactions generally, you know, and

20

the cashier is going to be worried that she can't say to

21

the customer, you charge more if you use a credit card.

22

And I guess I wanted to know, which theory is your

23

theory?

24
25

MR. GUPTA:

I think our theory is what you

just described.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

2

MR. GUPTA:

The latter one.

But I think Justice Alito is not

3

wrong that if -- it would certainly implicate First

4

Amendment concerns if the -- if the State were to say,

5

here is how you have to display your prices.

6

would be -- it could be, theoretically, a disclosure

7

regime; right?

8

has posited, a disclosure regime --

9

But that

And that's what the solicitor general

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counselor, can I --

10

I'm -- part of -- I'm a little bit like Justice Alito

11

and less than Justice Kagan.

12

anybody is saying about this statute or what it means,

13

but not because it's necessarily vague.

14

see anything about speech in the statute.

I'm not sure what you or

15

MR. GUPTA:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I just don't

Well -The statute simply says,

17

"No seller in any sales transaction may impose a

18

surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in

19

lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means."

20

me, it's very simple:

To

One price for everything.

21

MR. GUPTA:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, Justice Kagan -You walk in and --

23

forget about -- I don't know where they get the discount

24

from or that the statute permits that, because what it

25

says on its -- to me, on its plain terms is one price.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

And you told Justice Breyer that that was okay.

2

Certainly would be -- I'm hard-pressed to see if that's

3

the interpretation given to what I view as the plain

4

meaning of the statute, that that would be

5

unconstitutional.

6

MR. GUPTA:

But this is not a statute that

7

functions in a vacuum; right?

8

that enacted statutes at the same time, some of them put

9

in their text a surcharge is okay; a surcharge is not

10

And in the other States

okay --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

MR. GUPTA:

13

New York didn't, but it -- but everyone has

New York didn't.

-- a discount is not okay.

14

agreed that it has been interpreted in parallel with

15

those statutes.

16

And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, this is a really

17

nice agreement, except the State below had two different

18

interpretations.

19

MR. GUPTA:

But the -- but the State has

20

never wavered from its interpretation that framing the

21

price difference as a -- as a discount is perfectly

22

permissible under this regime.

23

And you don't have to take my word for it

24

and look only at the text of the statute.

25

at the way it's been enforced.

You can look

So the statute was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16

enacted in the 1980s.

2

the first reported criminal prosecution under that

3

statute.

4

A few years thereafter, there was

And in that case, a gas station owner had

5

the posted prices, cash and credit.

6

what caused the criminal prosecution is that the cashier

7

made the mistake of describing the price difference as a

8

nickel more for using a credit card rather than a nickel

9

less for cash.

But the -- what --

It was that speech and that speech only

10

that triggered the criminal prosecution.

11

prosecutor in that case and the judge all agreed that's

12

what the statute meant.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the

And you tell me that

14

that's what the State is going to tell me, that if they

15

post credit card price 2.10, cash price $2, that if the

16

cash -- if the person comes to the cashier and gives

17

them a credit card, the cashier is going to say, you

18

know you're paying a surcharge of 10 cents; you're

19

going -- you're going to be prosecuted for that?

20

MR. GUPTA:

Well, the State can try to run

21

away from the enforcement history, but I think it would

22

be very difficult to run away from the most recent

23

enforcement history.

24

merchants in 2008 and 2009.

25

have, in the Joint Appendix, declarations from merchants

3

And what happened in all of those cases was

4

that somebody called up on the phone from the attorney

5

general's office pretending to be a customer, and they

6

said, what are your prices?

7

well, it costs, you know, say, $10 to buy the heating

8

oil and then, you know, this many cents more to pay with

9

a credit card.

10

And those merchants said,

And that was the only speech that they

11

engaged in.

12

There's nothing deceptive about that.

13

they were -- they were targeted by the attorney

14

register and there's a surcharge, no, it's $103, and

understand you say, well, that's -- it's not this case.

4

But under your argument, how would you analyze the --

5

the hypothetical that I posed?

6

MR. GUPTA:

I

I think if the State wants to

7

have a regime where they think it's a deceptive practice

8

because you aren't telling people the -- the higher

9

price or the -- the price difference at the same time,

10

and that people are hoodwinked or there's bait and

11

switch, they are perfectly free to do that.

12

that there's a criminal regime in this case, and false

13

advertising law certainly makes it possible to do that

14

anyway.

15

that way, we have no problem with that.

16

continue to do that.

17

It's odd

But if the State wants to enforce this statute
They can

If you look at Joint Appendix 144, you'll

18

see an example of a bait-and-switch scenario like that.

19

The odd thing there is that the State didn't invoke

20

its Section 518, the no-surcharge statute.

21

the false advertising statutes, which suggests that this

22

statute has something else in mind.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And --

I'm going to say when I

2

the way Justice Sotomayor did, that it mandates a single

4

interpretation, but I feel somewhat uncomfortable about

5

ruling on the constitutionality of this statute without

6

knowing how the court of appeals, New York court of

7

appeals would interpret the statute.

Now, that may be a -- an uninformed

8
9

So why shouldn't we certify that question of
interpretation to that court before we plunge into this

10

First Amendment issue?

11

MR. GUPTA:

12

didn't ask for certification below.

13

you know more about the New York statute than you know

14

about any of these statutes.

15

have confronted the Florida statute, the California

16

statute, they had no problems striking them down without

17

an enforcement history.

They all have been understood

18

to mean the same thing.

And -- and I think, you know,

19

what you said -- what this Court said in Sorrell is that

20

plaintiffs in a First Amendment challenge have a right

21

to prompt adjudication despite ambiguities in State law.

Mr. Gupta, you're putting

really a lot of emphasis on a few cases in which

4

law as written doesn't really do any of the things that

5

you're saying.

6

as written actually can be read -- and Justice Sotomayor

MR. GUPTA:

Right.
Let's take that out of the

14

we are requiring is that you list the higher price.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN

20

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

21

SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY

22
23
24
25

MR. FEIGIN:

Okay.
Mr. Feigin?

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I want to focus on what I take to be the
core of the First Amendment dispute between the parties,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

which I think centers around a merchant who, for

2

example, wants to label a soda as costing $1.95 with a 5

3

percent credit card surcharge, and the question is

4

whether the State can require the merchant to

5

specifically identify a price of $2.05 before charging a

6

customer who wants to use a credit card that amount.

7

A law like that is very similar to a law

8

that simply regulates pricing or requires a merchant to

9

honor their offers to make or enter into a contract of

10

the sort that we normally wouldn't think is subject to

11

any First Amendment scrutiny.

12

that the requirement that everyone seems to agree is

13

imposed here is best viewed under this Court's

14

precedence as a speech regulation because, in effect,

15

it's prescribing how the merchant communicates an

16

otherwise lawful pricing scheme.

17

We nevertheless think

But to the extent that New York's law, like

18

the Federal law, simply requires a disclosure in

19

dollars-and-cents form of any higher credit card price

20

in circumstances where the merchant has decided to

21

display the lower cash price in dollars-and-cents form,

it's a perfectly valid consumer disclosure law under

this Court's decision in Zauderer.

that they would like to advertise in the reply brief.

2

Which ways do you think -- or would the New

3

4

conduct illegal?

5
6

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, I don't think I can

answer that question as to the New York law.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MR. FEIGIN:

9

I --

Why?

Because I think we lack a

definitive interpretation from the New York court of

10

appeals.

11

as the first 25 minutes of questioning revealed,

12

involves what the New York law actually does under

13

particular circumstances.

14

I think much of dispute between the parties,

I can answer that question on the assumption

15

that the New York law tracks the former Federal law,

16

which, the only thing the Federal law actually did once

17

you trace through the definitional sections was to

18

require, as I said -- as I was saying earlier,

19

disclosure in dollars-and-cents form of a higher credit

20

card price when the merchant has decided to post a cash

21

price.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Fine.

So look at

23

this -- if that's what this law means, which of these

24

four ways of advertising would be permissible and which

25

would be unpermissible?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

MR. FEIGIN:

Option A, where it's a $10 cash

2

price, $10.20 credit price, would be fine.

3

where it's $10 cash price, 20 cents surcharge per item

4

added to credit card purchases, would not be

5

permissible.

6

dollars-and-cents form, it would be 10.20.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

Option B,

You'd have to actually disclose in

10 -- you would have to

say $10.20.

9

MR. FEIGIN:

10

Correct.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I'd like --

So that's regulating

11

speech; it's not regulating price, because it's the same

12

price whether -- I can do that math.

13

MR. FEIGIN:

The -- that is why we think

14

that this is better viewed as a speech regulation under

15

this Court's precedence.

16
17

But let me explain why I think it's a
reasonable disclosure.

18
19
20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Finish this -- all

right.
MR. FEIGIN:

Option C, Your Honor, which is

21

$10, 2 percent surcharge, would be the same as Option B,

22

you'd actually have to say $10.20.

23

which is $10.20, 20-cent discount for cash purchases, is

24

fine because you're disclosing to the consumers the

25

highest possible price that they would have to pay in

Alderson Reporting Company

And then Option D,

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

dollars-and-cents form.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and your

3

understanding of why it is a speech regulation, it -- is

4

because it affects the way you list prices; is that

5

right?

6

MR. FEIGIN:

7

So a law, for example, that simply required

That's right, Your Honor.

8

a merchant who made a particular representation that the

9

price of this item is $1.95 and required that merchant

10

to honor -- and that was all the merchant said, didn't

11

say anything about surcharges at all, and the law simply

12

required the merchant to honor that price when the

13

consumer gets to the cash register, that's an economic

14

regulation.

15

pricing or contract offers, but the -- the law here, I

16

think everyone agrees, does something a little bit more.

17

That's just a regulation that is regulating

In Options B and C that I was just

18

discussing with Justice Sotomayor, you can have a price

19

tag that does reveal a -- the existence of a surcharge

20

expressed as a mathematical formula and the law would

21

say that's not good enough, you have to actually list it

22

as a price.

C, but simply requiring an additional disclosure.

tell them that the credit card price is $10.20.

9

It

The reason that's permissible

10

constitutionally under Zauderer is that -- I think it's

important to keep in mind the legislatures are

disclose the existence of the surcharge.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

cents, but I'll think about that while --

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. FEIGIN:

I thought it was $10 and 2

I think there are two reasons

5

why it's reasonable for a legislature to decide that if

6

it's requiring --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

MR. FEIGIN:

9

Yeah, right.

-- a disclosure of the facts

that the credit card price is going to be higher, it can

10

require that disclosure to be made in dollars-and-cents

11

form rather than a mathematical formula.

12

First, the price --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, no, I thought

14

you were telling me that they -- that it's not enough.

15

Even if it's in cash, if they say that's a 20 -- 20-cent

16

surcharge, that violates the statute.

17
18

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, if all they said

was $10 price and 20-cent surcharge --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

-- and they don't say $10.20

credit card price, that, as we understand it, would be a

violation of the Federal statute.

if -- if B or C as stated are a violation of the New

6

It is not, and I think for two

truthful information.

7

MR. FEIGIN:

All that's required -- Your

8

Honor, it's not prohibiting them from saying what's in

9

Options B and C.

It's requiring a further disclosure in

10

dollars-and-cents form.

11

why Congress or the New York legislature could

12

permissibly require the disclosure to be made in

13

dollars-and-cents form.

14

I think there are two reasons

First, that's the most easily digestible

15

form in which people receive prices.

complete a math problem.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. WU:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The plain text of New York's statute refers

only to a pricing practice and not to any speech.

preliminary question about the division of litigation

authority in New York State?

8

or the solicitor general have the authority under New

York law to bind all of the district attorneys in the

Does the attorney general

10

State to an interpretation of this statute?

11

attorney general issued a -- an official interpretation

12

so that all of the district attorneys will be required

13

to -- to enforce this in the same way?

14

MR. WU:

And has the

So the attorney general and the

district attorneys are separate authorities under New

York law.

17

attorneys for the counties where these Petitioners are

located are parties to this case --

MR. WU:

-- and have expressed their

Yeah.

MR. WU:

many.

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

So you tell us how you interpret this, but

There are many.

3

how do we know how all of these other district attorneys

4

are going to interpret the statute?

5

it differently.

6

MR. WU:

They may interpret

Well, I don't think fundamentally

7

there should be a debate about the -- the statute here.

8

And -- and it's because a plain reading of the text here

9

means reading what it means to impose a surcharge.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, you know, there does

11

seem to have been a debate about what this statute

12

means.

history and I think -- I don't really understand why

14

this violates that law.

15

away from some of that enforcement history in your

16

briefing and said, look, the cashier can call it

17

whatever she wants to call it as long as the listed

18

price is the credit card price.

19

contradicting some of this enforcement history where a

20

different understanding of this law was used.

Because I look at some of this enforcement

And, in fact, you've walked

But that is

21

So how do we deal with that?

22

MR. WU:

Justice Kagan, I disagree that we

23

are walking away from the enforcement history here.

24

See, I think if you actually look at what the

25

enforcement history looks like, especially from the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

attorney general's office, that it confirms sort of the

2

plain reading of this statute in a single-price scheme.

3

And the heating oil company example, I

4

think, is the clearest one.

5

when the investigator from our office called up and

6

asked, what is your price, they were given a single

7

dollars-and-cents answer.

8

Appendix they asked Parkside Oil, how much is a gallon

9

of oil?

10

In each of those cases,

And on page 106 of the Joint

And they said, $3.45.
And it was only when the investigator said,

11

I'd like to pay by a credit card, that at that point the

12

oil company representative said, I'm going to impose a

13

surcharge of an extra 5 cents per gallon set on top of

14

the previous price.

15

And I think that pricing practice reflects

16

the commonsense understanding of the word "surcharge,"

17

which is an additional fee or charge on top of a

18

baseline that the seller itself has -- has established.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But under your view, if

20

the heating oil people had said, it's $103 if you pay by

21

credit card; if you do not pay by credit card, pay by

22

cash, it's $100, that is lawful?

23

MR. WU:

24
25

That's -- that's correct.

I mean,

if the heating oil representative -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then it's a matter of how

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

the pricing structure is communicated --

2

MR. WU:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

MR. WU:

Well --- in the speech.

Well, I mean, let me respond in

5

this way, which is, of course the definition or the

6

determination of whether there's a surcharge will look

7

back to the seller's original pricing practices, because

8

that's the meaning of a surcharge, is a difference from

9

some previously conveyed price.

10

But the First Amendment doesn't prohibit the

11

State from using a previously conveyed price as a

12

baseline for a price regulation.

13

States has acknowledged, a regulation that just said you

14

shall adhere to your previously conveyed prices or even

15

previously advertised prices is a perfectly

16

understandable economic regulation that would be

17

conduct.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As -- as the United

But suppose -- suppose

19

in -- in the heating oil example they said, it's $103,

20

but cash is $100, and that's because we impose a

21

surcharge.

22

Would that be lawful?
MR. WU:

That -- that would be fine.

I take

23

that to be similar to Justice Kagan's example about the

24

$1 charge for a cup of coffee with -- with a -- with a

25

description of it as a surcharge.

Alderson Reporting Company

And the statute does

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

not prohibit that scheme because, at the end of the day,

2

the listed price, which is in that case conveyed over

3

the phone, is the same as the price charged to a credit

4

card customer.

5

But --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is your answer to the

6

reply brief examples the same as the solicitor general's

7

office?

8

the statute could be read more broadly?

9

And do you have a concern the way it does that

MR. WU:

So we -- our answers are the same

10

as to the four examples there, and we do not think it is

11

read more broadly.

12

clear from the lighter side of history here is that New

13

York intended to carry out the same policies and same

14

purpose as the Federal statute that had just lapsed, and

15

the same history is present in all of the other States

16

that have adopted a similar surcharge issue.

17

I mean, one thing that is crystal

JUSTICE ALITO:

Then why didn't New York --

18

I mean, New York adopted this against the backdrop of a

19

lot of consideration at the Federal level.

20

not adopt the Federal definitions?

21

MR. WU:

Why did it

I can't answer that question

22

because nothing in the legislative history explains why

23

they did not.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

MR. WU:

What did the other --

But --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- the other States that

2

picked up after the Feds didn't renew the statute, what

3

did the other States do?

4

MR. WU:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

did or did they copy the Federal statute?

7

MR. WU:

At -Did they do what New York

Well, the vast majority of them did

8

not adopt the Federal definition.

9

only Massachusetts adopted the Federal definitions.

As far as I'm aware,
And

10

there are some exceptions where some of the statutes

11

actually have a separate definition of a surcharge,

12

which is just the plain meaning definition that we have

13

adopted here, which is in addition to a previously

14

disclosed or regular price.

15

statutes are really -- should be, we think, read

16

similarly here.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so all of these

Well, if I had the authority

18

to interpret the New York statute, which I really don't,

19

and I saw that they copied part of a prior statute, but

20

they deliberately omitted other parts of the prior

21

statute, I would be tempted to infer that they had a

22

reason for omitting the definitions.

23

they didn't want to be bound by that, so they wanted

24

something different.

25

MR. GUPTA:

And that was that

I don't think there's anything

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

in the history that would support that interpretation,

2

Justice Alito.

3

that they may not have felt it necessary was because

4

just as the Federal statute originally did not have

5

these definitions for a period of many years, the

6

legislature may have believed that the ordinary meaning

7

of a surcharge is obvious enough that they didn't need

8

the clarifying definitions of the -- of the Federal

9

statute.

10
11

And I would just say part of the reason

JUSTICE BREYER:

Go ahead.

Are you

finished?

12

MR. WU:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, sir.
All right.

I may

14

be the only one that needs this help, but I do have this

That has nothing to do

Two, I think that the reason we're having so

impossible, to distinguish between surcharge and

3

But that's all almost

Three, the fact that you have the questions

4

you've had and both sides of the bench have had such

trouble with this, to me, is strong evidence that the

6

Court should stay out of this under normal First

Amendment standards.

to discover all kinds of price regulation all over the

place that suffers to greater or lesser degrees from

Because if we don't, we are going

That's where I'm coming from.

13

Now, you tell me how to do it.

14

MR. WU:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -That is, you tell me, given

should we narrow?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I can't look at this

Official - Subject to Final Review

49

starting your answer to Justice Breyer by saying, look

2

at the statute and see what the words of the statute are

3

doing.

4

MR. WU:

Well, if I could get to that in

5

just one second and finish the answer to Justice

6

Breyer's, because I think given the way the statute is

7

phrased, the easiest way to dispose of this case is to

8

recognize this as a direct price regulation that this

9

Court in 44 Liquormart and other cases have held is not

10

subject to First Amendment scrutiny.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it doesn't set a

12

standing price.

13

lets the merchant set the price.

14

how that price is described.

15

different from OPA ceiling prices, which says you cannot

charge more than the ceiling price.

the limit as to what the -- the merchants can charge.

18

New York is not regulating what the price of the goods

19

are.

20

It doesn't set any price at all.

MR. WU:

It

And the question is

So I think it's quite

Here, the sky is

But the way to understand the

21

statute -- and I think this answers Justice Sotomayor's

22

question as well -- is that once the seller has chosen

23

that price, which I agree they have a free choice about,

24

then its ability to change that price for someone who

25

uses a credit card is constrained.

Alderson Reporting Company

And I think this is

easiest to understand in the scope of a single

4

are in large part unadorned by any conditions about when

8

you even if at the end of the transaction you take a

9

10
11

Those prices

And you know, in the course of that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, I don't, because I

know I have to pay sales tax.

12
13

You walk into a store, they give you a

MR. WU:

Well, you might have to pay sales

tax.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And every -- and every

15

State I have to figure out what that sales tax is and

16

I've got to do the math in my own head.

17

MR. WU:

That's -- that's correct.

And --

18

and there are a lot of price adjustments that sellers

19

could impose.

20

et cetera.

21

here, because what do those price adjustments apply to?

22

And at the end of the day, New York's position under the

23

ordinary definition of a surcharge, is all of those

24

adjustments apply to the regular or starting price --

25

price of a good or product.

You could have coupons, member discounts,

But I think those actually support our point

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, here's the narrow

2

way in which this seems to affect communication, speech.

3

I'm a seller.

4

cash customers a dollar and I want to charge credit card

5

customers $1.05.

6

price as $1.05 and then the cash customers get a happy

7

surprise, that seems fine.

8

as a dollar and then the credit card companies get a

9

not-so-happy surprise, that can't be done.

I set my prices.

All right?

I say I want to charge

Now, if I put my list

But if I put my list price

So it does

10

affect the way a seller communicates which price he's

11

going to say is the regular price, is the list price.

12

So why isn't that a speech regulation?

Now,

13

you might say, as the solicitor general does, it is a

14

speech regulation, but it's only a disclosure regulation

15

and subject to a lower standard.

But you're saying it's

16

not a speech regulation at all.

And I want to know why,

17

given that it is affecting which price you choose to say

18

is your list price.

19

MR. WU:

So even if it does affect what a

20

seller does in that case, it's only because the list

21

price is being used as evidence to support whether an

22

imposition -- whether a surcharge has been imposed

23

later.

24

Amendment for conduct to be defined in relation to

25

previous acts of speech.

And it's perfectly permissible under the First

You know, conduct can be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

initiated evidence or carried out through speech and the

2

First Amendment doesn't bar a State from regulating it

3

in that way.

4

And I'll just use a couple of examples that

5

I think make this clear.

6

seller shall adhere to a previously advertised price,

7

that regulation, which the United States says is an

8

economic regulation, would be susceptible to the same

9

analysis.

Under a statute that says the

If somebody wants to charge $100, they know

10

that what they have to do is list $100 in their

11

advertisements or in their stores.

12

or $95 or $90.

13

They can't list $98

And a similar example comes from this

14

Court's decision in Rumsfeld v. Fare, which recognized

15

that part of determining whether law schools had

16

improperly excluded military recruiters from campus

17

might be looking at the contents of emails or notices or

18

other evidence of the underlying conduct of exclusion.

19

And that's the only way that a seller's prices are being

20

used here.

21

determine whether the seller has engaged in the unlawful

22

conduct of increasing a previously disclosed price.

23

It's being used as the benchmark to

Now, why this is clear under the statute,

24

getting back to Justice Sotomayor's question, is in part

25

because of the posture of this case.

Alderson Reporting Company

We have a set of

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

Petitioners here who are bringing, as their counsel has

2

acknowledged, an as-applied challenge.

3

at the conduct that they want to engage in here, there

4

is no ambiguity about what they think is the baseline or

5

regular price.

6

And if you look

All of them want to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But suppose that a

7

business makes a point of its reputation is -- is

meeting all prices.

9

business that's very close to another State and the

We meet prices.

And there is a

10

other State allows cash, has -- has an option where all

11

surcharges are permitted and surcharges are -- are

12

disclosed.

13

says, you know, we will charge the lowest price, we will

14

meet the price, but we add 3 cents for credit cards.

15

And because that's difficult to enforce, all of our

16

prices are increased by 3 percent for everybody because

17

of the difficulty of applying surcharges in some cases.

18

Is that valid?

to be a credit card surcharge in that case.

Breyer says that -- that this is so complicated, doesn't

that indicate the statute is vague?

7

MR. WU:

It -- it does not, because under

8

the vagueness doctrine under the Due Process Clause, as

9

long as there are a core set of cases that people can

10

understand, that's enough to sustain it.

11

when it is clear how it would apply in the -- in the

12

context of the plaintiffs' own allegations.

13

And especially

And here again -- and this is clearest from

14

page 101 and 102 of the Joint Appendix.

15

Petitioners here want to do and what they will do the

16

moment the statute is invalidated is to list a single

17

set of prices, a single set of prices for each of their

18

goods and services and then collect an additional man on

19

top for -- for a surcharge.

20

What the

Now, it might be the case that other

21

Petitioners or other plaintiffs would engage in more

complicated pricing schemes.

24

and when they arise.

25

we can say from the enforcement history is it's deeply

But the proper way to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So they hold this in an

4

as-applied a challenge -- I hope your adversary will

5

confirm this -- that they want to do these four things

6

that's in the reply brief, one or the other.

these are okay, whatever else the law means we're not

8

reaching because this is an as-applied challenge.

appeals say it's okay, it's okay; right?

11

MR. WU:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes. I think that's -But you're saying more

13

than this.

14

but that there's a further disclosure law that when a

15

customer calls up the gas station, the gas station can't

16

do any one of these four things and potentially other

17

things, too; right?

18

MR. WU:

You're saying this is how they advertise it,

I don't think that's our argument.

19

And I should clarify I do think some of these schemes

20

are not okay in the sense that you couldn't impose a

21

credit card surcharge under some of these boxes.

22

I'm understanding your question correctly, we are not

MR. WU:

But -- but one point I want to

2

respond to is the idea that what somebody says over the

3

phone here can affect the underlying price structure.

4

mean, we treat the phone calls, including the phone

5

calls in the enforcement history here, as just evidence

6

of what the underlying prices are in the same way that a

7

printed placard itself, although an active

8

communication, would itself be evidence of the

9

underlying prices.

And there's no dispute here that

10

when the heating oil representatives were describing

11

their company's prices, they were describing a price

12

scheme that they had settled upon --

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, suppose some kids

21

have a lemonade stand or they're washing cars and they

say a glass of lemonade, $1 and then somebody comes up

to them and says I'd like to buy that with a credit

It might happen today.

I have -- I have never

can -- could process a credit card purchase if they

5

wanted to?

6
7

MR. WU:

These are tech savvy kids so they

The statue has no exemption for

kids selling lemonade.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. WU:

I think -- I think prosecutorial

10

discretion would almost certainly be exercised in

11

that -- in that situation.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

You can think of examples

13

which I can't.

14

their own energy who use time-of-day metering, there

15

could be lots of regulatory rules that affect how an

16

energy company presents the pricing of this element or

17

that element included.

18

these areas the correct First Amendment standard is

19

rational basis, nothing stronger, how then do I

20

distinguish the cases which you've talked about how

21

you -- what you say in respect to price because after

22

all, even if it's just evidentiary, this statute does

23

affect what people say as to price.

need a legal distinction here to get at what I think the

In areas like energy, people who make

Now, if I think that in all

Alderson Reporting Company

58

MR. WU:

Well, they affect only what you say

2

about price as an incident to preventing you from

3

engaging a certain pricing practice in the first

4

instance, and I think this is the distinction this Court

5

has drawn in cases like Virginia State Board of

6

Pharmacy.

7

advertisements, but the understanding there is that the

8

advertisements are describing an underlying price that

9

would be applied.

I mean, that's a case about price

For instance, if a consumer walked

10

into a pharmacy and wanted to buy a prescription drug.

11

And -- and this case is about that consumer transaction.

12

The descriptions of the prices are

13

incidental to the regulation of the underlying consumer

14

transaction and the price that the seller may impose

15

here.

16

And -- and I think the point about the other

17

regulations that may apply is also an important one in

18

a -- in a couple of respects.

19

important point of these other regulations is that they

20

demonstrate that there are multiple ways in which the

21

legislature or Congress can address what happens to a

22

default or regular price, and they all operate in

tandem.

The starting point for all

If we --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If we -- if we agree with

8

the government that this is because it affects how the

9

merchant characterizes his price, would you also take

10

the position that the government takes that it's

11

justified as a disclosure law?

12

MR. WU:

We -- we think that it can be,

13

and -- and -- and in part that's because we agree with

14

the government, with the Federal Government, about the

15

compliance options under this statute.

16

It is true under both the New York law and

17

the Federal law that the way a seller complies with the

18

statute is to display a dollars-and-cents price that it

19

later charges the credit card customers.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you explain to me how

21

it's a disclosure requirement to suppress the actual

22

cost of the credit card purchase?

23

MR. WU:

Well, it's not suppressing the

24

actual cost of the credit card purchase.

25

preventing -- well, I'll -- I'll say two things.

Alderson Reporting Company

It's only

Official - Subject to Final Review

60
1

At most it is preventing one way of

2

conveying a credit card price, but the better way to

3

look at it, as the government explains, is that it's

4

just requiring a different price -- the higher

5

dollars-and-cents price for credit card customers to be

6

displayed.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Wu, you think, is this

8

not true, that the dual pricing scheme is legal; is that

9

right?

10

MR. WU:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's correct.
That was something that the

12

Second Circuit did not decide, said it was abstaining

13

on.

14

question of whether this is a disclosure requirement.

15

Because if the dual pricing scheme is not legal, it is

16

really hard to characterize this as a disclosure

17

requirement.

It seems to me that that's quite relevant to this

18

Would you agree with that?

19

MR. WU:

I think that it would be.

But --

20

but I think it's important to recognize also why the

21

Second Circuit abstained on this question.

22

because it rejected our interpretation of the law which

23

would allow dual pricing.

24

that the statute was readily susceptible to an

25

interpretation that would allow dual pricing because of

It didn't so

It did so because it found

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

61
1

the clear indications that New York intended to follow

2

the Federal statute, and so it wouldn't adopt an

3

interpretation that would raise constitutional problems.

4

And although -- although we think this Court could adopt

5

our interpretation of the -- of the State law, it would

6

also be fair to recognize that there is no reason to

7

deviate from the Federal statute on this front.

8
9

But -- but I also want to respond to one
other point that Justice Ginsburg had raised, which is

10

whether this suppresses information about credit card

11

costs, and -- and it does not in this important sense:

12

Nothing about the statute prevents a seller from

13

educating consumers about credit card costs, informing

14

them about it, talking about it.

15

Petitioners here do do so.

16

instance, has told its customers not to use credit cards

17

because of the additional costs that they impose, and

18

they remain free to do so under this statute.

19

Many of the

Brooklyn Pharmacy, for

And in an important sense, that speech is

20

actually a better and more direct way of advocating

21

about credit card costs than the mere imposition of a

22

surcharge.

23

Your Honor, Expressions Hair Design, for

24

instance, wants to impose a flat 3 percent surcharge

25

without apparently any further speech here.

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

62
1

difficulty with that as a message about credit card

2

costs is, one, it doesn't explain why the surcharge is

3

being imposed; two, it doesn't say that it's being

4

imposed because of a specific thing, there's a merchant

5

interchange fee that credit card issuers charge; and,

6

three, it says nothing about the amount of the

7

interchange fee.

8

bears no relationship whatsoever to the actual costs,

9

which range from 1.1 to 2.7 percent, that sellers

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There is nothing about

MR. GUPTA:

The solicitor general agrees with us that

6

this is a restriction of speech, but posits that the

7

only thing that's left on the table is a disclosure

8

rationale that New York abandoned in the courts below

10

is that this is a criminal speech restriction.

if your merchant is faced with compliance, they've got

to know, if -- if you think this is a disclosure regime,
