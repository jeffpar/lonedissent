Mr. Eisenhammer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY B. EISENHAMMER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER,

8

AS APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

9
10

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

I would like to make three initial points.

12

First, what this case is about is whether

13

the Petitioner may bring a Fourth Amendment claim for

14

unlawful detention pursuant to legal process.

15

Second, this case is not about whether the

16

decision to prosecute is governed by due process, the

17

Fourth Amendment, or any other amendment.

18

And third, this case is not about whether

19

there's some constitutional tort named malicious

20

prosecution.

21

your numerous -- numerous suggestions made in Albright

22

that the Fourth Amendment supports this cause of action,

23

and bring the Seventh Circuit in line with all other --

24

with the Tenth Circuit ruling on this.

25

All we ask the Court to do is to affirm

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, but you need

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

to get past the statute of limitations problem and to do

2

that, you need to characterize it, as I understand it,

3

as a malicious prosecution claim.

4

time-barred.

5

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Otherwise, it's

What -- what I need --

6

what we need to do is determine the -- not the statute

7

of limitations, which is two years, set by State --

8

State -- by the State, but the accrual period.

9

Wallace, the Court has said that we -- you normally look

10

to, not the State law, but it's a Federal question, that

11

you normally look in reference to the common law.

12

And in

And in Wallace, they did say that that would

13

be malicious prosecution that does have as an accrual

14

period favorable termination.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But favorable

16

termination has nothing to do with the Fourth Amendment

17

claim, right?

18

favorably terminated or not, the Fourth Amendment claim

19

and, it seems to me, the accrual begins when your Fourth

20

Amendment rights are violated with, say, an illegal

21

search.

22

And whether your prosecution is just

Whether you eventually are convicted or

23

acquitted, really, you have a claim for an illegal

24

search if there's been an illegal search without regard

25

to favorable termination.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

MR. EISENHAMMER:

But our claim,

2

technically, here is it is detention without probable

3

cause, not the search that occurred when he's -- when he

4

was arrested.

5
6
7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

But I mean,

regardless, whatever the Fourth Amendment claim is.
MR. EISENHAMMER:

Right.

And that detention

8

went through for 48 days after he -- after he became

9

subject to legal process.

10

I guess --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Was he subject to proper

11

legal process?

12

there isn't -- I always understood legal process as used

13

in Wallace and earlier of our cases as an independent

14

intermediary, generally a judge or a grand jury or

15

someone who looks at the facts as they exist and

16

independently makes a determination whether probable

17

cause has happened.

18

If legal process is corrupted because

If you have a corrupted legal process where

19

what the independent adjudicator is looking at is not

20

true because it's based on false information, have you

21

received legal process -- proper legal process?

22

MR. EISENHAMMER:

23

proper legal process.

24

been corrupted because --

25

You haven't received

You're -- you're correct.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's

And so I thought if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

you've never received it, then doesn't your time to

2

accrue for the improper detention occur when you're no

3

longer detained?

Here, it was the not guilty; correct?

4

MR. EISENHAMMER:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
So it's not a question

6

of whether -- when it starts.

7

does the illegal detention finish?

8

MR. EISENHAMMER:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The question is:

Correct.

When

Correct.

And because you have --

10

there's been no intermediate force, no intermediary

11

stepping in and breaking the chain of causation;

12

correct?

13

MR. EISENHAMMER:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15
16
17

Correct.

That's correct.

Am I understanding your

argument correctly?
MR. EISENHAMMER:

Yes.

You are, perfectly.

I wish I could take credit for that, but --

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, but I'm -- I -- I --

20

the only way I could think of it was thinking of it in

21

this way, because you're not claiming malicious

22

prosecution or not.

23

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Right.

Right.

You know,

24

Wallace talked about malicious prosecution.

25

a larger issue of 1983 jurisdiction, which is, you know,

Alderson Reporting Company

And this is

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

what is a proper accrual period for a constitutional --

2

a constitutional violation.

3
4

We don't -- we're not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So detention without

probable --

5

MR. EISENHAMMER:

-- cause.

Right.

And you

6

don't -- you're not -- you're not straightjacketed into

7

a particular common-law provision.

8

the right to fashion one that does justice, and this is

9

the one that does -- does justice.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're -- you have

I was confused.

I

11

thought there was a malicious prosecution claim here,

12

mostly because the question presented says, "Whether an

13

individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from

14

unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process so

15

as to allow a malicious prosecution claim based upon the

16

Fourth Amendment."

17

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Yes.

But that's -- that's

18

just a label, and that's what -- what the court, at

19

least in Wallace, has used as a label for talking about

20

these type of claims, and in other -- in Gerstein, too.

21

It's just -- it's just a label to, in a sense,

22

distinguish this case from detention without legal

23

process.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let me give you a

Then there's an appeal filed, and then

suddenly they find out the evidence was fabricated

and -- and the charges are dismissed.

Fourth Amendment violation for the entire
detention?

14

MR. EISENHAMMER:

No.

We would say the

15

Fourth Amendment -- at least based on your cases -- the

16

Fourth -- the Fourth Amendment claim ends at conviction.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

18

MR. EISENHAMMER:

And then the due process

claim or whatever.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why is the trial on

conviction any different than the Gerstein hearing?

22

They're -- they're both a legal process.

23

inquiry.

24

after the Gerstein hearing but not after the conviction?

25

There's an

Why is it that the Fourth Amendment applies

MR. EISENHAMMER:

One reason is that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

Gerstein -- the Gerstein hearing is a non-adversarial

2

hearing, so it would be a -- a grand jury proceeding.

3

While a -- a conviction, in a sense, presumes that

4

you're -- you're -- you -- you are -- you are held with

5

probable cause, and then you really have a due process

6

claim after that.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under malicious

8

prosecution law in the States generally, just as a

9

general principle, would there be a malicious

10

prosecution claim for the fabricated evidence in the

11

Gerstein case or in the pretrial suppression?

12

MR. EISENHAMMER:

I believe -- I believe so.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So then they would be over

14

with, so at least there's a legal recognition that there

15

can be a malicious prosecution claim in the Gerstein

16

hearing.

17

MR. EISENHAMMER:

No.

It's really a

18

Fourth -- well, here, it's a Fourth Amendment claim.

19

We're not -- we're not raising --

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm asking if, under State

21

laws, the tort law generally, you can bring a malicious

22

prosecution claim if there's fabricated evidence

23

produced at the Gerstein hearing that results in --

24

MR. EISENHAMMER:

In your release?

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- that results in your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10

detention.

2

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Well, yes --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's why there's damage

4

and they're suing.

5

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Right.

But you have to

6

be -- there has to be a favorable termination in order

7

for you -- it's an element of -- of State court

8

malicious prosecution, so you need to be --

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

It's terminated six

months -- or six weeks later.

11

MR. EISENHAMMER:

It would be a malicious --

12

that would be a malicious prosecution claim under State

13

law.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why do you make the

15

cutoff conviction?

16

that the police have lied all along and there was never

17

any basis for holding this person, why doesn't -- why

18

don't you have your Fourth Amendment claim until the

19

point where you're released from this unlawful custody?

20

If it turns out, even on habeas,

MR. EISENHAMMER:

You -- you could if you --

21

if you ruled that way.

Generally, this Court has ruled

22

that after conviction, there is -- there is due process,

23

your trial rights have been violated, so that has been a

24

different amendment that you've gone under.

5

one amendment cover more than one -- the same set of

6

facts.

7

It could be a -- it could
You could have more than

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but there's

8

just a different consequence to whether you terminate a

9

Fourth Amendment right or a due process right under

10

Parratt v. Taylor.

11
12

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Well, we're claiming it's

a Fourth Amendment right.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know.

But

14

you just answered in response to the question that one

15

could be both.

16

But if it's both --

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Yes, it could be both.

17

Usually -- or at least reading Justice Kennedy's

18

concurrence, it appeared that the due process

19

provision -- the due process claim dealt with the issue

20

of whether to prosecute, as opposed to this issue, which

21

is the decision to hold somebody, detain somebody,

22

pending a decision to prosecute or a trial.

23

Fourth Amendment that really covers this rather than due

24

process.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it's the

What happens to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

person who's let out on bail?

2

under your theory?

Are they out of luck

3

MR. EISENHAMMER:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5
6

No.

No.

Are you defining

"detention" as broadly as Justice Ginsburg was?
MR. EISENHAMMER:

Yes.

And in Gerstein --

7

and in Gerstein, the Court did make recognition that --

8

that detention could go beyond being released, depending

9

on the conditions of the release.

So it's not just -- I

10

would say it's not just Justice Ginsburg's concurrence.

11

It was this Court's opinion in Gerstein that that was a

12

possibility.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you explain why, even

14

if we accept your theory that -- that the unlawful

15

detention continues until he's released, why shouldn't

16

the statute of limitations trigger the -- when he is

17

initially arrested?

18

the statute of limitations be different just because we

19

label this Fourth Amendment --

20

Why -- why should the trigger for

MR. EISENHAMMER:

I think there's -- there's

21

some good reasons for that.

They were expressed in

Official - Subject to Final Review

13

you don't want to have a collateral attack.

2

collateral attack works to the detriment of -- of the

3

prosecution and to the defense in the case.

4

That

I think Justice Kagan's opinion in Kaley

5

illustrates the harm that could happen to the

6

prosecution if you allow someone to collaterally

7

attack -- use a sophisticated attorney to collaterally

8

attack the decision on probable cause while the case --

9

while the criminal case is pending.

10

If it works to the

detriment of the prosecution --

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Eisenhammer, why should

12

we even get to these questions?

13

case, the Seventh Circuit does something, says something

14

that no other circuit does, which is to say that they

15

say that there's no Fourth Amendment claim under Section

16

1983 at all, full stop.

17

As I understand this

If we think that that's wrong, oughtn't we

18

to just send everything else back to the Seventh Circuit

19

to decide what they think the Fourth Amendment claim

20

looks like?

21

accrual date it has, anything that they think about this

22

Fourth Amendment claim, send it back to them, having

23

told them that they're wrong about whether this Fourth

kind of a claim it is to -- before we can say whether it

4

exists?

5

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Yes.

And the starting

6

point is the Fourth Amendment.

7

question on the Fourth Amendment, because the

8

initial question --

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you answer the

You want us to say there's

10

some kind of a Fourth Amendment claim, but we -- we're

11

not -- we don't know what it is, but there's some kind

of a claim.

13

claim it is?

14
15

MR. EISENHAMMER:

No.

I'm saying the Court

can say that this is a Fourth Amendment claim.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's --

A claim for unconstitutional

detention.
MR. EISENHAMMER:

There's no -- yeah.

Just

as if -- if they had brought it up in Albright.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, what the statute of

21

limitations is on that claim or what the accrual period

22

is on that claim is something that we don't have to

23

decide in order to say, yes, you have a claim under the

24

Constitution for improper detention.

25

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but -- I mean,

2

the alternative that is argued is that it's a due

3

process claim.

4

whether the particular period that you're complaining

5

about is properly characterized as detention without due

6

process as opposed to a claim under the Fourth Amendment

7

would certainly be pertinent in deciding whether or not

8

to say there is a Fourth Amendment claim.

9

And whether or not they coexist or

MR. EISENHAMMER:

No.

I -- I think you can

decide whether there's a Fourth Amendment claim or a due

process without referencing the statute of limitations.

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

3

We think that this Court should locate the

constitutional right at issue in the Fourth Amendment

for the reason that the Fourth Amendment does apply to

pretrial detentions as this Court has long held.

detention to be supported by, one, valid determination

of probable cause at the outset of that -- at that

period of detention.

11

The Seventh Circuit error here was to find

12

that the Fourth Amendment stops operation once criminal

charges are filed.

as well that there's a variety of ways to make that

probable cause determination, including by the same

I think a wrong --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, it's wrong but

reasonable.

11

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, then, Your Honor, no,

I don't think it would be a Fourth Amendment violation

at all.

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, because, Your Honor,

I think that --

He's -- he's being

detained.

17
18

Why?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Violation of the Fourth

Amendment.
MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, because I

think that -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's why it seems to

24

me that there's a good argument that we should be

25

talking about malicious prosecution, not the Fourth

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

Amendment.

2

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

3

that the Fourth Amendment does afford reasonable

4

mistakes of fact and law, for that matter, in -- in

5

allowing someone to be detained.

6

fact, the probable cause standard itself allows for

7

factual errors in the determination.

8
9

So it's not that.

In

But here, the allegation that Mr. Manuel
claims is that he's detained on drug charges that relied

10

entirely on fabricated evidence.

11

claim is a claim of detention without probable cause

12

under the Fourth Amendment.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

And we think that that

It's unreasonable.

And

14

the -- the defendant wouldn't have qualified immunity,

15

but it's not corrupt.

16

it.

17

There's nothing malicious about

Would there be a claim?
MS. EISENSTEIN:

Your Honor, I think it

18

depends on what the causation would be in terms of the

19

officer's role in bringing the charge.

20

So if the officer puts forth and has -- is

21

the one pressing to bring a charge that is not

22

reasonable, objectively unreasonable under the Fourth

23

Amendment, subject to qualified immunity and other bars

24

to suit, he may be liable.

25

the error falls with the magistrate or the prosecutor,

But to the extent to which

those kinds of claims would be foreclosed by the

2

absolute immunity that those individuals --

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if it's an F.B.I.

agent?

5

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

6

that the measure of liability for a Federal officer

7

follows the same sort of immunities and rules.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I thought you said in

your brief that the standard for State and local law

10

enforcement officers might be different from the

11

standard for Federal law enforcement officers.

12

MS. EISENSTEIN:

If I did, Your Honor, I

13

don't -- I don't believe we were referring to -- if you

14

could clarify which standard you mean, the standard for

15

qualified immunity or -- or --

16
17

JUSTICE ALITO:

On page 30 of your brief.

30 to 31 of your brief.

18

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

19

that in those particular instances, that relates to --

20

that piece of our brief relates to special factors that

21

could potentially account for hesitation on a Bivens

22

claim that don't necessarily apply to Section 1983.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, and that's what I'm

24

saying.

So you think that there should be a remedy for

25

violations by State and local police officers, but not

1

under identical circumstances, possibly, if it's a

2

Federal officer.

MS. EISENSTEIN:

I'd also --

We wouldn't draw that distinction.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Not in this instance, Your
And -- and

Well, then what were you

I don't understand it.

MS. EISENSTEIN:

I think that there may be

other circumstances not presented by this case, not

10

presented by a -- a case of fabricated evidence or

11

unreasonable pursuit of a wrongful criminal charge that

12

may lead to a different result under 1983 under Bivens.

13

But I don't think we have to -- we just wanted to make

14

sure that the Court understood that the Bivens claim may

15

have different ramifications.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.

I mean, I

may be missing something, although this is quite a

simple case.

A policeman makes an unreasonable stop and

Now, you can sue him, assuming you overcome

Now he takes you off and puts you in prison,

either with a magistrate or without a magistrate, and

you are therefore being unreasonably detained.

It's an

2

Then you have a trial, and using the same

rotten evidence, you are convicted.

because you are viewed as, by the law so far, being in

And the

We don't want to look

Now, that's the -- the framework in my mind.

Is it right?

11

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

12

That is exactly the framework that the government puts

13

forward, that it's not just the mere fact of being held

14

in jail, but that the constitutional right depends on

15

what process was infringed.

All right.

So let's

I understand you so far.
The question presented was, I think -- I

don't have it -- I do have it here.
"So whether an individual's Fourth Amendment

21

right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues

22

beyond legal process so as to allow a malicious

23

prosecution claim based upon the Fourth Amendment."

24

The Chief Justice was right.

25

The question

presented is, does the Fourth Amendment consonance house

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

a malicious prosecution claim, which is something very

2

different than what you're describing as a Fourth

3

Amendment seizure and detention without legal process.

4

MS. EISENSTEIN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

5

Because in our view, the constitutional inquiry is step

6

one, but step two is to determine the elements and

7

accrual date and other prerequisites to suit under our

8

Section 1983 tort.

9

may be governed by the closest common law analogy.

10

And in that instance, the accrual

When the challenge at its core is arguing

11

that the wrongful prosecution and the wrongful

12

institutional process led to the detention without

13

probable cause, in our view, the closest analogy is a

14

malicious prosecution suit, and that that --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But are you suggesting

16

we have to take every element of the -- whatever the

17

elements are?

18

briefing, malicious prosecution is defined differently

19

from State to State.

20
21

Because from what I understand from the

So if that's the case, what are the elements
that you see for a 1983 claim?

22

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Does it include malice?

Your Honor, we do not think

23

that a constitutional tort under 1983 simply adopts

24

common law or State tort elements of malicious

25

prosecution.

Only the accrual rule is -- as based on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

this Court's decision in Heck and Wallace are taken up

2

by the common law analogy.

3

In terms of malice, no, Your Honor, we don't

think malice, as it's known in common law or most State

5

courts, is an element of this kind of claim.

6

advocate that this Court treat a probable cause

7

determination underlying a criminal charge the same way

8

it treats a probable cause determination underlying a

9

search warrant, which includes the Franks standard.

We do

We

10

don't think of that as a malice standard of common law,

11

but rather, an extension of the Franks doctrine.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I nearly said

13

that it inspired examples we take to flesh this out, but

14

it does seem to me to be just pretty result-oriented

15

cherry picking.

16

now we'd like the statue of limitations part, so we

17

don't take that in.

18

malice, so we take that.

19

still holding true to the approach in Wallace, if you

20

just start picking things in and out depending upon the

21

demands of the particular case.

22

If once you say, well, here's a claim,

We -- we don't want to have to show
I mean, I don't know if we're

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

23

that Wallace did say that Federal accrual rules in

24

particular were governed by the common law analogy.

25

think that that's as far as it goes in terms of choosing

3

The statue of limitations, for

But here, the Seventh Circuit's view of

4

accrual flowed from its error as to the scope of the

5

Fourth Amendment.

6

this go back, in many ways we think that's absolutely

7

appropriate, because the Seventh Circuit erred by

8

holding that since the Fourth Amendment stops at the

9

time criminal process begins, it thought you can't have

So to Justice Kagan's proposal that

10

a malicious prosecution analogous claim, because there

11

is no such Fourth Amendment claim.

12

If you peel that error away, we think that,

13

even under Seventh Circuit jurisprudence, they would

14

agree that a favorable termination requirement would

15

apply in such circumstances.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When does the Fourth

17

Amendment claim stop?

18

you're convicted, it stops.

19

question, suppose none of this comes out until habeas,

20

and then we find out the police have lied from day one.

21

I -- I think co-counsel said if

MS. EISENSTEIN:

In -- in response to my

So, Your Honor, we do see

22

those as distinct phases, and that when you're held --

23

an individual is held pursuant -- before trial, pursuant

24

to a finding of probable cause by a magistrate or a

25

grand jury, that that is a Fourth Amendment claim.

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

once the person is held pursuant to a finding beyond a

reasonable doubt at trial, that due process and other

constitutional protections take over.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But suppose there's a

pretrial suppression hearing in which both parties are

represented, and the court reaches a wrong result with

reference to the admission of the evidence.

MS. EISENSTEIN:

Does a

May I answer, Your Honor?

Your Honor, I think that it -- it may be a

11

Fourth Amendment violation, but whether a plaintiff

12

could bring those kinds of claims would be governed by

13

preclusion principles and other similar bars, once that

14

issue had been actually litigated in a State court.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In a State court

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. SCODRO

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3
4

MR. SCODRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

I think it's very important to frame what is

6

before the Court this afternoon.

And to begin, I think

7

it's essential to note we are not disputing at any point

8

in this litigation that misstatements made that result

9

in a finding of probable cause at a Gerstein hearing is

10

a Fourth Amendment violation, nor does the Seventh

11

Circuit disagree.

12

The reason this came up to the Seventh

13

Circuit as it did -- and this may be important in

14

understanding the context -- this is on a motion to

15

dismiss for statute -- for violation of the statue of

16

limitations.

17

the one that was appealed, and that one survived

18

momentarily in the district court because Petitioner

19

claimed that that one claim has a favorable termination

20

element because it is malicious prosecution.

21

All of the claims were dismissed but one,

He reiterated that claim before the Seventh

22

Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit reached two

23

conclusions.

24
25

One, you have a Fourth Amendment claim which
they discuss, and that the only claim before them was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

based on the lie at the Gerstein hearing.

2

Fourth Amendment claim, but it is already accrued; it

3

accrued too early; it is untimely.

4

You have a

Now you're asking us to recognize a

5

different breed of Fourth Amendment claim, namely, a

6

malicious prosecution Fourth Amendment claim, because

7

you'd like to overcome the time bar.

8

recognize that Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution

9

claim.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We do not

Mr. Scodro, I -- I just have

11

to say I read this differently, so you can tell me why

12

I'm wrong.

13

But I'm -- in the last column of the Seventh

14

Circuit's opinion, so there are twice where the Seventh

15

Circuit says what it thinks.

16

when after the arrest a particular person is not let go

17

when he should be -- so it's after the initial seizure,

18

and then the person is not let go, the Fourth Amendment

19

gives way to the due process clause as a basis for

20

challenging his detention.

21

The first time it says,

And then in the last paragraph it says,

22

"Once detention by reason of arrest turns into detention

23

by reason of arraignment, the Fourth Amendment falls out

24

of the picture."

25

So it seems to me that twice, the Seventh

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

Circuit says very clearly that you have this Fourth

2

Amendment claim until arraignment or legal process, and

3

after that, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the

4

picture.

5

And at the very basic level, before you get

6

into these questions of what's the accrual date or

7

anything else, it seems that that's the thing that the

8

Petitioner is saying is wrong, that the Fourth Amendment

9

claim continues after arraignment or after legal

10

process.

11

is a different question, but it's still a Fourth

12

Amendment claim, and -- and -- and that's what the

13

Seventh Circuit rejected.

14

Now, when it accrues, when it doesn't accrue

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, I think I would

15

direct the Court to the top of JA 103 as well, where the

16

Court also notice -- notes the fact that they have found

17

Fourth Amendment claims, even in terms of false

18

information in an incident report, even at a preliminary

19

hearing, which comes long after the initiation of

20

process.

21

What the Court in context has read -- and by

22

the way, this is consistent with past statements by the

23

Seventh Circuit, the -- the fundamental statement the

24

Court has made -- and this comes from Newsome, the 2001

25

decision from which this jurisprudence has blossomed in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

the Seventh Circuit -- relabeling a Fourth Amendment

2

claim as malicious prosecution would not extend the

3

statue of limitations.

4

This has been the nature of the battle.

And

5

on page 21 of the cert petition in this case, Petitioner

6

makes clear why a question presented doesn't end halfway

7

through.

8

Amendment right that survives the initiation of process.

9

If, by "process" they mean Gerstein hearing,

It doesn't ask merely whether there's a Fourth

10

we agree.

And I think the Seventh Circuit would agree

11

as well.

But it goes on to say, "so as to allow for a

12

malicious prosecution claim."

13

cert petition, they explain to the Court what they mean

14

by that when they say that, "The fate of this appeal to

15

this Court turns on whether the Court does or does not

16

adopt a favorable termination element," and that that's

17

why this makes an ideal vehicle, to answer Justice

18

Alito's earlier question, which is:

19

elements of this claim?

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And on page 21 of their

What are the

I didn't think that was a

21

difficult question.

I thought that everyone agrees that

22

if a policeman wrongly arrests you -- you know,

23

maliciously arrests you, et cetera -- and there you are

24

in his custody and he brings you over to the jail, puts

25

you in jail, up until the point you see the magistrate,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

you have a claim for false arrest.

2

MR. SCODRO:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Correct.
And we said that that claim

for false arrest is a constitutional claim.

5

MR. SCODRO:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

It violates the Fourth

7

Amendment.

What time limit applies?

8

time limit, because that's the most analogous.

9

MR. SCODRO:

10

The false arrest

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then we get into the next

11

stage.

Now you're in front of a magistrate, and the

12

magistrate says, stay in jail for two more months.

13

that violate the Fourth Amendment?

14

prosecution.

15

Does

Not malicious

Does it violate the Fourth Amendment?
The reason that we tend to think it does is

16

because all the circuits have said it does; that is,

17

Judge Higginbotham said that in the Fifth Circuit.

18

lot of the circuits picked that up.

19

every one.

But they said that, too, violates the Fourth

20

Amendment.

Now we have a problem.

21

A

I'm not saying

What statute of limitations do we use for

22

that one?

And there, the circuits seemed to have picked

23

malicious prosecution not because they're going to

24

follow every element, but because it's the State law

25

that provides the closest analogy.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1
2

And that seems to me where we are in this
case.

You don't have to go much further than that.

3

Am I right so far?

4

MR. SCODRO:

You are correct.

The issue

5

before the Court is which accrual date for limitations

6

periods should the courts be --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you will accept -- or

8

will you accept for purposes of this argument that once

9

this individual is brought by the policeman to jail and

10

they go before a magistrate, and the magistrate using

11

the same bad evidence says, stay here in jail for

12

several -- for a while -- for a week, anyway, until we

13

get to trial, that that period is a violation of the

14

Fourth Amendment, assuming that they were all lying, et

15

cetera.

16

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, yes.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Then the question is:

18

Do we use the malicious prosecution as an analogy, not

19

all the elements?

20

is fabulous, I get to the narrower question I have, why

21

isn't it a good analogy?

22

And so now the question, great, this

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, let -- let me

23

answer it why it's not a good analogy, and I'll also

24

answer -- I think flesh out just slightly whether or not

25

this remains -- the moment in time when the police

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

officers lie to -- to submit an affidavit with

2

falsehoods to a magistrate at a Gerstein hearing, and

3

the magistrate finds probable cause, what we do not

4

dispute, and what we do not think the Seventh Circuit

5

would dispute, is that that is a violation of the Fourth

6

Amendment.

7

Now, the question of whether or not

8

malicious prosecution is the proper analogy, the answer

9

is absolutely not, and Wallace tells us why not.

10

Wallace tells us -- now, the Petitioner has shifted just

11

slightly from a reliance on common law favorable

12

termination, which is what most of the circuits on their

13

side of the split have done.

14

to Your Honor's question and to your point.

15

This also goes, I think,

Most of the circuits on the other side of

16

the split have used favorable termination, but they've

17

done so by adopting it as part of the underlying

18

four-element common law tort, and they think if that's

19

what we're calling it, then it's going to have favorable

20

termination.

21

A smaller number have relied on an

22

extension, a drastic extension, of this Court's decision

23

in Heck.

24

Petitioner in the reply brief, that Heck ought to be

25

expanded to apply here.

And that's the request now made by the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

But Wallace was very clear.

Heck only

2

applies -- the delayed accrual principle and the

3

favorable termination element that comes with it apply

4

only where you have an extant conviction.

5

doesn't exist here.

6

And that

The court went through a mental exercise.

7

They said, look, if you can realize that you have a

8

Fourth Amendment claim before you're convicted, if the

9

elements can be in mind, you know you've been wronged in

10

a Fourth Amendment way before you are convicted, then

11

that is not a claim that is entitled to the delayed

12

accrual principle of Heck.

13

And the reason was very simple.

Because as

14

this Court said in Gerstein, Fourth Amendment

15

contemplates that you can have bad arrests and good

16

convictions.

17

protects the innocent as well as the guilty.

18

expanding Heck to apply the circumstance where all you

19

have is an ex parte requirement, or finding rather, of

20

probable cause, requiring that civil plaintiff to then

21

prove vindication at the end of the day would close the

22

door on a potential universe of Fourth Amendment claims

23

and instances.

24
25

And nevertheless, the Fourth Amendment

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
discrete claims.

And

I think you can have

One wrong is you never should have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

been arrested, so you have a Fourth Amendment claim for

2

that.

3

They extended that arrest.

4

one wrong which ends on arrest, but then if you are

5

continuing to be held based on trumped-up false

6

information, why isn't that like a continuing tort?

7

it continues until it ends.

Another wrong is they kept you in detention.

8
9

MR. SCODRO:

So I don't see why you have

And

Well, Your Honor, just to make

sure that I've been clear, again, we do agree that the

10

lie -- the second lie Your Honor has described, the lie

11

before the magistrate, is actionable under the Fourth

12

Amendment.

13

accrual period run from when one is ultimately released,

14

I would make a couple of points in response to Your

15

Honor's question.

16

If the question is why then doesn't the

First, Petitioner has been very careful not

17

to make that argument.

18

idea would be inconsistent facially with the cert

19

petition, which claimed they need the benefit of

20

favorable termination to prevail.

21

wouldn't need it if they were instead arguing for a

22

period of a continuing seizure.

23

Indeed, the continuing seizure

They, of course,

Lower courts have rejected the notion of a

24

continuing seizure, and they're not raising it here.

25

And I think the reason may be twofold.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

The first is that it runs into -- it runs in

2

the face of traditional accrual principles that this

3

Court has said, cases like Ricks and others, that it's

4

not the period of harm that matters for accrual

5

purposes.

6

thereby has all the elements needed to proceed.

7

It's when one first experiences the harm and

And a case like Morgan, which was a hostile

8

work environment case, is really the exception that

22

and the post-process arrest, and Wallace itself in that

23

regard, I think, breaks through the notion of a

continuing seizure.

25

As Wallace itself concluded, there can be a

The final point I would make -- and I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this comes out in one of their amicus briefs; namely,

2

the brief by Professor Alschuler -- taken to its logical

3

conclusion, the logic of continuing seizure may lead one

4

to conclude that the seizure doesn't end until the

5

ultimate period of incarceration concludes.

6

that means is now you have potential civil plaintiffs

7

bringing claims 10, 15, 20 years down the road without

8

any prior notice to the would-be defendants, no ability

9

to maintain evidence and so forth.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And what

Why do you need to give

11

evidence to somebody who's fabricated the reasons why

12

you're in jail?

13

think that it's important to cut off recovery against

14

the police officer who bases an arrest solely on

15

fabrication.

16

later or immediately, if you've done something as

17

untoward as that, as unconstitutional as that, why

18

should it matter?

19

And -- and I don't know why you would

It doesn't seem so horrible to me.

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, two points.

Years

The

20

first is, and this is a point of clarification, we're

21

not suggesting that damages arising from lies at a

22

Gerstein hearing, for lack of a better term for it,

23

would not run subject to traditional common law

24

proximate causation principles through part or all of

25

the pretrial period.

There may well be interrupting

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

events, but that I just want to make clear.

2

suggesting that those damages may not be available, in

3

this case, had the claim been brought timely for the

4

full 48 days, depending on how those common law

5

proximate cause principles would shake out.

6

We're not

The other point -- and this is one that the

7

States made in their amicus brief in Wallace.

They've

8

made it again as have the municipalities as amici.

9

They've made the point that early notice to the State as

10

employer of agents who are engaged in bad acts is

11

extraordinarily important.

12

learning sooner rather than later that they have

13

individuals in their ranks that are violating the

14

Constitution.

15

Government is intent upon

And this Court in Wallace, in turning aside

16

basically the same extension of Heck that is recommended

17

for the Court, or the Court's invited to take in this

18

very case, when they turned it away, they said one of

19

the reasons is we need notice to the would-be defendants

20

in those cases.

21

They can preserve evidence to ensure --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You know, counselor,

22

it's not as if most States don't receive that kind of

23

notice in these situations.

24

believed in most, until some independent evidence is

25

discovered long after the conviction.

The defendants are just not

Alderson Reporting Company

In my

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

experience -- and you can point to one that's

2

different -- I've never come across any of these cases

3

where any defendant falsely accused of a crime hasn't

4

vigorously announced his or her innocence and vigorously

5

tried to tell the authorities this police officer is

6

corrupt.

7

So I'm not -- I don't know what extra notice

8

you need other than that.

The situation is unique.

9

We're talking about total fabrication.

You have so many

10

other ways out of liability, qualified immunity, Franks.

11

There are so many other protections against the State

12

and individual officers for -- for errors.

13
14
15

But why should we worry about you not
receiving notice?
MR. SCODRO:

The reason, Your Honor, is that

16

in this case, when the later accrual principle that

17

Petitioner requests under Heck or as a matter of a

18

common law element, is purchased not only at the price

19

of delayed notice to the would-be defendant, it's

20

purchased at the price of closing the courthouse door on

21

a number of potential Fourth Amendment claimants, those

22

who are subject to unlawful arrest, but are later

23

validly convicted.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Scodro, can I ask -- I

might be misunderstanding this, so you'll tell me if I

am.

2

taking now is diametrically opposed to the position that

3

you took in the Seventh Circuit.

4

something, and this is from oral argument, but my clerk

5

tells me that this is what happened.

6

a transcript, but maybe there is.

7

what my clerk tells me happened at oral argument.

8

Judge Rovner says there are ten other

9

But it seems as though the position that you're

So I'll just read you

I think it is not

But at least this is

circuits that have now recognized this kind of claim,

10

this kind of Fourth Amendment claim.

11

let's just assume that we do what those ten other

12

circuits have done, which, of course, they didn't do,

13

but she says let's just assume it.

14

At what point would you think the statue of

15

limitations would begin to run?

16

maybe not you, but you --

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

And she said,

And then you -- or

You say, well, if you were

to recognize such a claim --

20

MR. SCODRO:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- the accrual is the time

22

at which the proceedings are terminated in favor of that

23

individual.

24
25

So in this case it would be -- I think the
date would have been May 4, 2011.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

And then Chief Judge Woods says, so you're

2

assuming that the constitutional tort would follow the

3

same pattern that State law does and require the

4

favorable termination, because if there's no favorable

5

termination for all the policy reasons the States have

6

considered, there's no injury.

7
8

And again, whoever the lawyer was said,
that's correct.

9
10

So am I misunderstanding this, or are you
saying that's not correct; that's wrong?

11

MR. SCODRO:

I think that that is correct

12

insofar as what the lawyer was being asked, as I

13

understand it, having also listened to the argument,

14

Your Honor, is that --

15
16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is there no transcript for

this?

17

MR. SCODRO:

I am not aware of a transcript.

18

The Seventh Circuit may especially -- part of that quote

19

appeared in the reply brief in support of the cert

20

petition.

21

me what the lawyer is being asked is, if we are to

22

follow suit, what -- again, taking it back to what

23

was -- this was on a motion to dismiss on limitations

24

grounds.

25

that they have an accrued claim or a claim with a

And what that quote makes clear, it seems to

The -- if -- if they're not able to establish

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

delayed accrual sufficient to satisfy the limitations

2

period or under a traditional Fourth Amendment theory,

3

can we overcome this limitations period by virtue of

4

these common law elements.

5

asked, as I -- as I heard that argument, what the

6

attorney was being asked is, isn't -- do you agree that

7

what they are trying to do here is join what every other

8

circuit has done.

9

circuit has done, they would have a favorable

10
11

What the attorney was being

And if we join what every other

termination element.

Or --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Oh, I don't think that

12

that's -- I mean, maybe, I guess.

I mean, it seems to

13

me that the much more natural way of understanding this

14

is to say, look, if we do what every other circuit has

15

done in the sense that we acknowledge that there is a

16

Fourth Amendment claim here, post-legal process,

17

something which you yourself have now acknowledged

18

today, that if we acknowledge that, what would the

19

accrual date be?

20

date would be the date of termination.

And then the lawyer says the accrual

21

MR. SCODRO:

Sure.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and now you're saying

23

it wouldn't be.

And I actually don't know whether it

24

should be or it shouldn't be.

25

Circuit for a moment considered that question.

I don't think the Seventh

Alderson Reporting Company

And I

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

guess it's -- it's another reason why I think we should

2

just send the whole thing back.

3

figure out whether you forfeited this claim.

4

Seventh Circuit can figure out, if you didn't forfeit

5

this claim, what the right answer is.

6

language -- and I have not listened to the tape myself,

7

so I have to admit that -- but to me, this language

8

suggests that you forfeited this.

9

MR. SCODRO:

Yeah.

The Seventh Circuit can
The

But to me, this

Your Honor, as I --

10

again, in context, I think what the lawyer was being

11

asked is, if they get the benefit -- and I believe the

12

quote in the reply in support of the -- the part of the

13

quote that appears in the reply in support of the cert

14

petition includes a reference to, well, along with the

15

common law elements, the lawyer is saying, yes, if they

16

were to get the benefit -- this is what they're trying

17

to do.

18

in the briefs was we want the benefit of the

19

four-element tort recognized in other circuits, most

20

because they're just adopting wholesale the tort; a few,

21

because they seem -- they cite Heck in lieu of the

22

common law element.

23

them what they're asking for, that is, if this Court

24

follows those other courts, would they have a May 4th

25

accrual date?

I mean, no one denied it.

What they were saying

And the question was, if we give

And the answer is yes.

Because that's

what they've been seeking all along.

Now, what's wrong with what I just said?

22

MR. SCODRO:

23
24

Well, Your Honor, two points in

response to that.
The first would be Wallace says or holds
that if you have the claim on day one, then that -- it

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

is -- it's accruing on day one.

2

you -- there's no extant conviction.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We're not going to give

But it's a different

4

claim.

5

prolonged detention.

6

I took issue with you when you said if you hold for this

7

Petitioner, then people who are falsely arrested but

8

properly convicted will have no claim.

9

don't see that.

10

One claim is for arrest, and the other is for
Two different claims.

That's why

I don't -- I

They have a false arrest claim.

They

don't have a prolonged detention claim.

11

MR. SCODRO:

Well, Your Honor, I think what

12

would happen, they wouldn't have a claim based on

13

misstatements at the Gerstein hearing if, in order to

14

make out that claim as Petitioners contend, they would

15

have to show that ultimately their criminal litigation

16

terminated in their favor.

17

is extended or the common law element is extended -- and

18

this is why it's not the best analogue, Your Honor.

19

if it -- if it would be helpful to have a common law

20

point of guidance on this, in Footnote 12 of our brief,

21

we provide a list of common law cases, an example of

22

common law cases in which the Court addressed a question

23

like this.

24
25

That's the request.

If Heck

We have an ex parte proceeding in which a
magistrate has issued -- I'll take the Stewart case,

It never blossoms.

JUSTICE BREYER:

The person

He's released,
And the

What's your -- what's the

What's the best analogy?
MR. SCODRO:

That it's -- this form of

11

malicious prosecution where you didn't have to prove

12

favorable termination, because all that was against you

13

at that point was an ex parte determination with State

14

law like that.

15
16
17
18

This was --

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is your opinion?

What

is the State law that does apply the best analogy?
MR. SCODRO:

I think the closest analogy

is -- is false arrest.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

So now, what is this -- what is the -- what

21
22
23
24
25

False arrest.

Okay.

is the statue of limitations for false arrest?
MR. SCODRO:

The State law, it's still the

personal injury limitations period of two years.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Fine.

So he was

being detained for up to, let's say, the 90th -- 90th

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48

day.

2

90th day as the beginning of the two-year running.

3

so now we run it for two years, and it's still May 12th

4

or whatever.

5

He's still being detained.

MR. SCODRO:

So now we'll count the

But, Your Honor, a false arrest

6

claim under Wallace accrues once process begins.

7

it's not running for that 90 days.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. SCODRO:

10

And

So

It would include --

Why not?

Well, as we --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Either he's being

11

held under -- isn't he being held unlawfully on the 41st

day?

13

14

copying the State law.

find an analogous period of time.

16

MR. SCODRO:

All we're doing is trying to

But, Your Honor, by imposing

17

the favorable termination element of the common law

18

claim, it would run headlong into the Fourth Amendment

aims; what the Fourth Amendment is geared to vindicate.

The Fourth Amendment, this Court has held,

case, what -- what -- the cost of borrowing that

23

favorable termination element and importing it into a

claim based solely on lies and an ex parte proceeding,

25

which is what we're talking about with the Gerstein

And in this

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hearing, doing so would mean that if you're the victim

2

of lies at a Gerstein hearing and you're detained, but

3

ultimately you are constitutionally convicted as

4

evidence amasses against you, the need to show favorable

5

termination, it will be impossible for that plaintiff.

6

And so the Fourth Amendment right will not be something

that that plaintiff can vindicate.

that Wallace didn't allow Heck to expand to instances

narrow, and the way to resolve this case is -- is now

equally narrow.

The way to resolve the case is to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What you're saying is if

you're falsely arrested, you have a good claim for false

arrest.

It doesn't matter that you were properly

I do want to be clear in saying that the

8

closest analogous tort is false arrest, that is treating

9

it the way I think the Seventh Circuit has, which is

10

that it runs up until what we call the first appearance

11

where you have the initiation of adversarial process.

12

By no means does the limitations period, or is there a

13

tolling that runs from the period of the lie at the

14

Gerstein hearing through the pretrial period.

15

As I said at the outset, that is subject to

16

traditional tort common law principles of -- of

17

proximate cause.

18

recoverable for that period, but it's based on the lie

19

at the Gerstein hearing.

cannot be extended to apply to a claim that exists

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

When does the Fourth Amendment violation
end?

10

MR. SCODRO:

Sure.

You would have it --

11

this returns to Justice Ginsburg's point.

12

have a Fourth Amendment claim for the initial

13

warrantless arrest.

claim for misstatements at a Gerstein hearing that then

15

led to ongoing pretrial seizure.

16

that claim may run throughout the period of pretrial

But with regard to the nature of the

constitutional violation that occurs at subsequent

claims consistent with this Court's holding in Mooney --

period.

So I -- I hope that answers Your Honor's

question.

Whether or not those damages run throughout

traditional proximate cause.

I understand.

Opposing

counsel or defendant's counsel ever present in a

MR. SCODRO:

Generally, in this case, yes.

Often they are because the Gerstein determination is

frequently made as part of the first appearance, which

note that the Seventh Circuit, with respect to the

statute of limitations to the accrual point -- point,

2

uses favorable termination in their due process cases.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

What happens in this

4

situation?

The person is -- is initially arrested and

5

held for a period of time based on fabricated evidence,

6

but then before trial, shortly before -- before trial,

7

other valid evidence is gathered and the person is

8

convicted at the trial.

9

kind of claim that you are asserting?

And if so, when

10

would -- when would the claim accrue?

Would the

11

favorable termination defeat the claim?

12

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Now, does that person have the

The -- he would -- at that

13

point, if you use Heck as the case that covers this

14

particular issue, he would not -- since he was convicted

15

under Heck, he would not be able to bring the claim if

16

that claim attacks the conviction.

17

If it doesn't attack the conviction, as the

18

Court sort of pointed out in, I think it was in Footnote

19

7 on suppression hearings or on evidence --

20
21

JUSTICE ALITO:

attacks the unlawful detention.

22

MR. EISENHAMMER:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24
25

I'll say it attacks -- it

So it wouldn't have the -It's not the conviction.

would not be defeated by -MR. EISENHAMMER:

Then -- then I would say

under Heck, the Heck exception, they could bring -- they

2

could bring then suit.

3

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Then when would the claim

accrue?
MR. EISENHAMMER:

I think it would accrue at

6

that point, at the conviction, as I read Heck.

Because

7

I think it would be -- it would be -- in this particular

8

case, it would be unfair to the -- to the individual to

9

speculate on whether -- what evidence comes out at the

10

-- at the trial to determine whether or not that

11

really -- that probable cause determination may or may

12

not attack the -- the --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if the outcome of

14

the -- of the trial is irrelevant to the Fourth

15

Amendment claim, as it would seem to be in the case of

16

an unlawful detention, then why should the claim not --

17

why should the accrual of the claim be tied to the

18

termination of the prosecution?

19

MR. EISENHAMMER:

Because at the -- at the

20

time it -- it has occurred, you -- well, two reasons.

21

You don't know at that time whether or not it does

22

attack the conviction.

23

And second, you don't -- you don't want --

24

because you don't know whether that evidence heard at

25

the -- at the -- at the -- at the Gerstein hearing may

or may not -- some of it may come in; some of it may

2

not.

3

And then the other issue -- the other issue

4

is that you don't want parallel litigation going on,

5

or -- or collateral attack for many of the reasons

6

that -- that was stated in Kaley.
