ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act

12

applies to debt collectors.

13

in the Act as the most relevant here to include

14

individuals who regularly collect debts owed or due

15

another.

16

Debt collector is defined

When Respondent Santander was originally

17

hired to collect Petitioners' defaulted car loans,

18

there's no question that it was collecting the debt owed

19

or due another under anyone's interpretation of that

20

term.

21

when Santander purchased an assignment of that debt.

22

The question in this case is whether that changed

The Fourth Circuit held that it did,

23

wrongly, based on its interpretation of the key phrase

24

"owed or due another," which is used twice in the

25

definition of debt collector, once in the principal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1
2

definition, and again in the Clause (F) exceptions.
The problem with that interpretation is that

3

it cannot be squared with the use of the same phrase in

4

the Clause (F) exceptions, particularly with respect to

5

Clause (F)(iv).

6

like to walk through that exception.

7

page 4A of the appendix to the blue brief.

With the Court's indulgence, I would
And it's found on

8

As I mentioned, this is an exception for

9

somebody who otherwise qualifies as a debt collector

10

under the main definition for somebody who is collecting

11

a debt owed or due another.

12

is repeated at the beginning of Clause (F).

13

be somebody -- any person collecting or attempting to

14

collect a debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due

15

another, and then it says to the extent such activity

16

meets one of four qualifications.

17

And that same requirement
It has to

And the one I want to focus on is the

18

fourth, and that applies to somebody who's engaged in

19

activity concerning a debt obtained by such person as a

20

secured party in a commercial credit transaction

21

involving the creditor.

22

Now, I think the parties agree with the

23

FTC's interpretation of this.

24

situation in which a company, like a car dealership, has

25

gotten a commercial loan from a bank and put up as

This is applying to a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

collateral the debts that it's owed by its customers,

2

say, car loans.

3

The only circumstance in which that kind of

4

entity is ever going to be collecting on a consumer

5

debt, which is required at the beginning of Clause (F),

6

is that they've either foreclosed on the collateral, in

7

which case under the UCC, they will send a notice to

8

the -- the consumers saying we have been assigned this

9

debt; start sending the debt to us.

And if the consumer

10

asks for it, they have to send proof of the assignment.

11

Or if the assignment was given to them at the outset as

12

part of the secured credit transaction.

13

The problem for Respondents is that in

14

either case, the bank is only ever going to be doing

15

exactly what a debt purchaser does, which is collecting

16

from the consumers a debt that has been assigned to it

17

and keeping it on its own account.

18

Respondent's only answer to this is to say

19

that this -- no, no, this is a provision that is

20

addressed at the bank that is simply holding the debts

21

as collateral.

22

very beginning of (F)(iv) -- or (F) -- and Congress made

23

clear that the exception only applies to somebody who is

24

actually collecting or attempting to collect a debt.

25

And somebody who is simply holding a collateral is not

But that can't be right, because at the

Alderson Reporting Company

2

Now, as a consequence, adopting Respondent's

3

interpretation that somebody who's collecting on its own

4

account through an assignment, as a debt purchaser does,

5

as the commercial creditor does in the scenario we've

6

just described, in our view, they're not collecting the

7

debt owed or due another.

8

cannot be the person to whom Congress is referring in

9

subsection (F)(iv).

And as a consequence, they

It is an exception that not only is

10

completely surplusage and a null set, it's a -- an

11

exception that renders itself surplusage.

of the -- the requirement makes it impossible to satisfy

the -- the second set of requirements in (F) -- at the

14

bottom of (F)(iv).

grammatical, and it would be clear that Congress was

15

becomes important, particularly when the same phrase is

16

used again in another part of the definition, to adopt

17

an interpretation that, while it may not be the first

18

one that come to mind the first time it's used, you

19

still need to have an interpretation that allows the

20

same words to do work when repeated later in the

21

subsection.

22

What we have here is, I think, fundamentally

23

is that the word "owed" is a participle that's

This Court encountered a very similar set of

words in Robinson v. Shell Oil where it was trying to

decide whether Title VII, which prohibits an employer

5

from retaliating against its -- its employees, whether

6

that meant its current employees or could also mean its

7

former employees.

8
9

One of the things the Court did, although it
recognized that kind of on first blush you would think

current employees, is it looked at the statutory

11

interpretation of "employee."

12

defined as an individual employed by an employer.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Russell, do you have a

2

few examples -- I -- I suspect you've thought of this --

3

just of sentences which use the word "owed" to -- to

4

mean what you want it to mean in this case, without any

5

other context clues?

6

MR. RUSSELL:

You can talk about somebody

7

collecting a debt owed another.

8

could make clear that it was a debt that had been paid

9

off or discharged in bankruptcy.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And then the context

Right.

But you wouldn't

11

think that, right?

12

whether -- and I -- I understand that you have your

13

superfluidity argument, which is, in your view, a kind

14

of context clue.

15

is -- can you come up with any sentence which -- which

16

points toward your reading rather than towards

17

Mr. Shanmugam's?

18

I mean, I'm just wondering

But if you just look at the language,

MR. RUSSELL:

So, I mean, we've given a

19

couple examples in our reply brief.

20

speak of somebody who regularly collects debts that are

21

created by somebody else and even in that context, I

22

think you could refer to that as a debt owed.

23

Another -- I acknowledge that this maybe isn't the first

24

interpretation that leaps to mind, but I do think that,

25

you know, when you encounter a phrase like this, it's

Alderson Reporting Company

You know, we can

Official - Subject to Final Review

10

not unambiguous.

2

It can refer --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, usually, when we think

3

about ambiguous phrases, you know, we can say, well, you

4

could say this sentence and then it would mean X.

5

you could say this sentence and then it would mean Y.

6

Or

But my problem when I think about this word

7

is that I can never get it to mean what you want it to

8

mean, no matter --

9

MR. RUSSELL:

10
11
12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well --- how I construct a

sentence.
MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I give you the example,

13

if Congress had said a debt collector is somebody who

14

regularly collects debts owed or owing another, I think

15

that would be a perfectly grammatical sentence.

16

Congress might not want to use "owing" because it is an

17

awkward, archaic use.

18

And

But I think, you know, when -- when you

19

confront a -- a provision like this, you have to end up

20

looking at the use in both contexts.

21

to give the -- the Clause (F) any meaning is to

22

interpret it in a -- what might be the less natural way

23

in the first place.

24
25

And the only way

It's also a necessary way to interpret the
statute to give meaning to the way -- or to -- to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

respect the way that Congress has dealt with other

2

assignees, because we recognize that Congress probably

3

didn't have the debt-buying industry in mind when it

4

wrote this statute.

5

mind.

6

common in the -- the mortgage industry, for example, for

7

servicing to be performed by somebody else.

8

But it did have other assignees in

And particularly credit -- debt servicers, it's

And Congress provided in Clause (F)(iii)

9

that somebody who was assigned -- somebody who obtains a

10

debt after it has gone in default is subject to the act.

11

And that's -- it's very common for debt servicers -- and

12

everybody agrees that this a provision, (F)(iii), that's

13

about debt servicers -- it's very common for mortgage

14

servicers to obtain assignments of debts after it's gone

15

into a default, precisely because they need it in order

16

to be able to enforce the debt in court, to file a

17

lawsuit to collect or to foreclose on a mortgage.

18

And --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is this -- is -- as

20

the case comes to us, we're not addressing the status of

21

Santander as a debt servicer, though.

22

MR. RUSSELL:

That's correct.

My point here

23

is simply a structural one, and that is, that Congress

24

clearly contemplated that some assignees would be debt

25

collectors, notwithstanding the fact that they are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

collecting a debt assigned to them by somebody else,

2

which is all that a debt purchase is, it's an assignment

3

of the debt for value.

4

And Congress said that if a -- if a -- a

5

mortgage servicer is assigned a debt after it's gone

6

into a default, Congress intended for them to be treated

7

as a debt collector.

8

actually isn't going to be what happens, because a

9

mortgage servicer, as soon as they obtain an assignment,

But under Respondent's view, that

10

under their view, they're collecting debt owed and due

11

themselves, not owed and due another.

12

And so we end up with this situation with a

13

Clause (F)(iii) provision.

14

applies to a mortgage servicer who has a contract to

15

collect a debt, but not if they've been assigned to the

16

debt.

17

to be assigned a debt if they obtain it after default,

18

because they need to have that assignment in order to do

19

the things that their customer wants them to do for

20

them, which is to file a lawsuit.

21

And, actually, it only

And they're particularly likely, as I mentioned,

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I don't see a problem

22

with -- with (F)(iii).

23

to collect a debt owed or due to someone else, and it

24

concerns a debt which was obtained.

25

obtained, it doesn't mean owed.

The -- the party is attempting

And -- and if

You can obtain a debt

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13

that you don't own.

2

(F)(iii).

3

I don't see any problem with

MR. RUSSELL:

So there's -- there's two

4

problems with that.

5

of "obtained."

6

interpretation of it.

7

think the reading you're suggesting is that an assignee,

8

a debt servicer who has an assignment, would not be

9

covered if they are assigned that debt after default.

I -- I disagree with that reading

I don't think it's a very natural
But what it means, that -- I

10

And I think that does quite a bit of violence to how

11

Congress intended the statute to operate.

12

reason for Congress to have thought that it made a

13

difference with respect to the risk that a servicer

14

poses to consumers, whether they have been simply hired

15

on a contract to collect a debt --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

There's no

Why would they not be

17

covered if they acquired the debt before it went into --

18

I'm sorry -- after it went into default?

19

collecting a debt owed -- owed or due to someone else.

20

And they acquired the debt after it went into default;

21

therefore, they don't fall into (iii).

22

MR. RUSSELL:

They would be

Well, in Respondent's view,

23

somebody who is collecting on an assignment is

24

collecting a debt that is owed themselves.

25

suggestion is that an assignee is not collecting a debt

Alderson Reporting Company

So if the

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

owed itself --

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:
that?

4
5

Where -- where do they say

MR. RUSSELL:

I mean, I've approached

my limit.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

The (iv) is

7

Mr. Smith owes some money to a Company Jones, and

8

Company Jones assigns the debt to a servicing company,

9

all right?

And so the servicing company might have --

10

be -- it might be said, you can use it this way.

11

obtained the debt from Company Jones.

12

They

And so somebody might say that this assignee

13

is collecting a debt from Smith, that Smith owes

14

another, namely Jones.

15

in this statute.

16

debt collector.

17

But we don't want to cover them

We don't want to cover that kind of
So they write (iv).

And the same is true of (iii).

They write

18

(iii) because they don't want mortgage -- mortgage

19

servicers to be falling within the statute, unless, of

20

course, the mortgage servicer is serving a dead

21

mortgage.

22

that reasoning doesn't seem, to me, illogical.

23

On the other hand, if we take your

Then why shouldn't they?

All right?

Now,

24

reasoning, you have to interpret this is, so I was

25

thinking of examples.

And I thought, well, what about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

one of these companies that goes and buys up other

2

companies, turns them around, and sells them.

3

buy a company, they buy the -- the receivables.

4

while they own the company, they're going to collect the

5

receivables.

6

definition, those receivables were once owed the company

7

that they're bought.

8

category of people falls within the definition.

And so there they are.

You see?

When they
And

On your

So on your definition, that whole

9

So it seems to me, although you point to

10

problems, they are not insuperable problems with the

11

word "obtained."

12

"is," I get into a lot of difficulties.

13

that was where -- I'm not saying that's my final view of

14

this.

15

Or if I accept your definition of
Now, that --

I'm just saying, how do you respond?
MR. RUSSELL:

So let me address your

16

difficulties, and then let me explain why, I think, the

17

problems on the other side are greater than you seem to

18

think that they are.

19

The difficulties arising out of mergers

20

or -- or buyouts of a company, I think, are -- are

21

completely separate from the issues here.

22

question of whether you would treat the -- the company

23

that buys another company or merges with another company

24

as obtaining the debt, or as simply a change in the --

25

the legal title of -- of the owner of the debt.

Alderson Reporting Company

It's a

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

In addition, subsection (6)(B), specifically

2

addresses companies that are collecting debts that are

3

owed to affiliate companies, and I think that that's

4

probably also a solution for that problem.

5

I think when you are talking about trying to

6

minimize the problems on the other side, you seem to be

7

operating on the assumption that it's possible to say

8

that somebody who has an assignment of a debt, say a

9

debt servicer, is not collecting a debt owed or due

10

another, or is -- I'm sorry -- is collecting a debt owed

11

or due another.

12

And we know that that's not right for two

13

reasons.

14

the second is how assignments are understood to operate

15

in the law, generally.

16

One, textual specific to this statute.

And

First, if you look at the creditor

17

definition, which is on page 2A, Congress defined

18

creditor to include the person to whom the debt is owed.

19

And then it created a special exception for assignees,

20

particular kinds of assignees who -- who are assigned

21

the debt after it is put into default.

22

exception would be unnecessary, unless Congress

23

understood assignees, generally, to be collecting a debt

24

that is owed to them.

25

That assignee

And that is consistent with the way

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

assignments work, in general.

2

3 of the UCC talks about negotiable instruments, and it

3

makes a distinction between the person entitled to

4

enforce the negotiable instrument, and the owner of the

5

debt.

6

So, for example, Article

And it's the person entitled to enforce the

7

PETE, who has the authority to insist on payment, and if

8

payment isn't delivered, to sue on the payment and to

9

collect on it.

And then the PETE is the person, if you

10

pay them -- the assignee, if you pay them the debt, it's

11

extinguished, even if they don't pass that money on to

12

the person that hired them to collect it.

13

So a servicer with an assignment is the

14

person to whom the debt is owed, in any meaningful

15

sense, as Congress recognized.

16

don't -- and I do think they do have a serious problem

17

with respect to (F)(iii) with this --

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if that's so, then I

Why do you have to get into

19

assignments at all?

20

your argument with respect to (iii), is to think of a

21

situation in which a person or an entity is collecting a

22

debt owed to another, and that person or entity obtained

23

the debt at a time when the debt was not defaulted.

24

that -- it's very easy to think of a situation like

25

that, with respect to the classic debt collector that

All -- all that's needed to defeat

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

does nothing but collect other people's debts, if

2

"obtained" means getting that debt for collection.

3

MR. RUSSELL:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

So -Your -- your answer is

5

that's not a reasonable -- that's not the right

6

definition of "obtained."

7

MR. RUSSELL:

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MR. RUSSELL:

11

responses.

12

be clear, because --

14

So that's what it comes down

to, right?

10

13

So I --

I have a couple other

One is that's not a solution to (F)(iv), to

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, I'm talking -- I'll take

them one at a time.

15

MR. RUSSELL:

16

So with respect to (F)(iii), the other

Okay.

Sure.

17

problem is that it ends up -- the result is that

18

servicers with assignments are not covered by the

19

statute at all, but servicers with contracts are.

20

And that's a very odd situation, to think

21

that Congress intended servicers who are simply hired to

22

collect a debt are -- if the -- if the debt is in

23

default, they are covered by the statute.

24

they're given an assignment in order to facilitate that

25

debt collection, which is very common when the debt in

Alderson Reporting Company

But if

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

default already, they are not covered, because they are

2

collecting a debt that's owed and due themselves, not

3

another.

4

In addition, I don't think, to the extent,

5

you know, we're looking at what Congress was trying to

6

do here, Congress thought that (F)(iii) was dealing with

7

servicers, who they thought was a different category of

8

people who required different treatment.

9

There's -- but as you just explained,

10

Justice Alito, that interpretation necessarily means

11

that any debt collector who is hired to collect a debt

12

before it goes into default, when it's merely

13

delinquent, which happens a lot, is entitled to this

14

exception, and they escape regulation entirely.

15

there is nothing in the legislative history, and there

16

is nothing in the reasons people give for why

17

third-party debt collectors are covered by the statute,

18

which would lead Congress to want to provide them that

19

exception.

20

And

I would say, in addition, you know,

21

"obtained" is also used in the Clause (iv) exception,

22

and, as I said, it's used in a way there that cannot be

23

referring to somebody who simply --

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

As to Clause

(iv), I'm not sure I understood what you said.

Alderson Reporting Company

So let's

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

say your company is owed a debt by other -- to -- other

2

people owe the company a debt.

3

give the -- the party extending the loan a security

4

interest in that debt, and now there's an effort to

5

collect that debt.

6

They get a loan.

Who is owed that debt?

Is not -- is it not

7

still owed to the -- the original party?

8

to the person with the security interest, is it?

9

MR. RUSSELL:

They

It's not owed

So if -- just to be clear with

10

the hypothetical, the -- the debt hasn't been -- the

11

security interest hasn't been foreclosed on?

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

MR. RUSSELL:

Yes.

Right.

So at that point, it's the

14

borrowers, the car dealership, in my example, who is

15

collecting the debt, not the secured party.

16

the Clause (F) exception only applies to the secured

17

party.

18

And the --

Right?
It says, obtained -- "concerns a debt which

19

was not in default at the time it was obtained" -- I'm

20

sorry.

21

debt obtained by such person as a secured party in a

22

commercial credit transaction."

23

I'm reading the wrong provision -- "concerns a

So it's only the bank.

And the only

24

circumstance in which the bank is going to be collecting

25

from the consumer is if the -- the security interest has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1
2

been foreclosed upon.
And then it's also important -- so you could

3

say, in that circumstance, well, maybe the bank is

4

trying to collect from the commercial borrower, from the

5

car dealership, but "debt" is a defined term in the

6

statute, and it only applies to consumer loans.

7

So the only time, under (F)(iv), any person

8

would be collecting a consumer loan as a secured

9

creditor, is when they have obtained an assignment of

10

that loan as a result of either foreclosing on that loan

11

because of default, or because it was assigned to them

12

in the first place.

13

But in either case, they're doing exactly

14

the same thing as a debt purchaser.

15

a debt on their own account that was originated by

16

somebody else, and assigned to them.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

They are collecting

Well, this situation -- I --

18

I mean, it's possible to think of situations that would

19

fall within that.

20

that are -- they are not situations that are very likely

21

to come up in -- in the real world.

22

It may be that they are not things

But the strength of your -- the -- the

23

degree of absurdity that you have to show under (iv),

24

depends on the ambiguity of the phrase due -- "owed or

25

due," and I mean, I think that's not just -- not the

you would read that.

say.

It's not the fiftieth way

It's just you're -- you're

MR. RUSSELL:

You

Well, taking that -- that I'm

7

unlikely to change your view about that, I think we have

8

identified something pretty strong, because we now have

9

a provision that renders itself surplusage.

You know,

10

it says, if Congress has enacted a statute that

11

regulates taxis only to the extent they're driven by

13

The first set of requirements cannot be met

in any situation with the second set of requirements.

And I

At the same

Now, if you don't think it's ambiguous in

20

either provision, I -- I don't know that I can do much

21

beyond trying to dissuade you of that.

22

if you do think that there's some room for

23

interpretation here, I think it's important to look at

24

the underlying purposes of the statute, and the way that

25

Congress has treated other similarly situated entities.

Alderson Reporting Company

But of course,

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

And the fact is, a debt buyer is much like a

2

debt servicer with an assignment, which, I think,

3

Congress clearly intended to be treated as a debt

4

collector when it obtained that assignment after the

5

debt was in default.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't dispute,

7

I -- I take it, that this particular context, with this

particular type of entity, is not what Congress had

before it when it passed the law.

That's true about -- I take

your -- I understand your point on assignees, I think.

4

Now, look at (iv).

Where is the word

"assignment"?

6

talking about is a person who takes a secured interest

7

in the debt, I suppose, or he lends some money to the

creditor, and in return, he takes some kind of secured

interest; doesn't really say what kind.

It's not there.

And what they are

And as part of

that, the initial creditor might assign him the original

And what you've said is, oh, they

So where did you get this idea that, in

fact, a creditor with a secured interest who has

22

taken -- you didn't say assignment?

MR. RUSSELL:

25

Sure.
But now, so where did this

come from that we're only talking about assignees?

your objection except to a subset of the section (iv)

assuming you're right, no one writes statutes perfectly.

You'll always under-include or over-include.

7

For if we're not always talking about

And as -- if you were talking about a subset,

MR. RUSSELL:

So let me turn you back to the

8

language of the provision, because I think, ultimately,

9

you don't need to know that much about commercial credit

10
11

transactions to be persuaded of our point.
The beginning of (F) makes clear that all

12

the Clause (F) exceptions, including (F)(iv), only apply

13

to any person collecting or attempting to collect a

yourself, under what circumstances?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Counsel, before you --

2

you sit down, you did make an alternative argument based

3

on 1692a(6); that is, you say, whatever else your person

4

here regularly collects or attempts to collect debts

5

owed or due to another, that's part of its business.

6

And then it also is -- purchases a debt.

7

I think you're making the argument that

8

if -- if they include the servicing that you described,

9

part of their business is that they are regularly

10

collecting or attempting to collect debts owed to

11

another, then even as to transactions that don't fit

12

that type, that they are -- well -- well, they are

13

creditors themselves -- their whole business gets

14

stamped with debt collection.

15

MR. RUSSELL:

Is that right?

That's correct, because the

16

main definition looks at the business model.

17

qualify by virtue of your servicing third-party debt as

18

a debt collector, you're subject to the Act under the

19

substantive provisions with respect to all your

collection activities, subject to the Clause (F)

exceptions.

If you

And that's the important point in response

to their argument that Congress couldn't possibly have

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you didn't -- you

Alderson Reporting Company

and you didn't raise that as a question.

MR. RUSSELL:

We did not raise that as a

I do think, because it is a

question presented without getting into that in any way.

14

I read that part of your brief.

MR. RUSSELL:

You said

I don't understand

We can fully answer the

I think it's -- it's an

15

important part of our structural argument about why

16

their interpretation of "owed or due another" is not --

17

cannot be correct, because they say the financial

18

services industry is not what Congress had in mind here.

19

And we make the point that, look, on a plain writing of

20

the text, even under their interpretation of owed or due

21

another, financial services providers are covered.

If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

2
3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

4

The sole question presented by this case is

5

whether an entity that purchases debts and then attempts

6

to collect them for its own account, qualifies as a debt

7

collector under the FDCPA on the ground that it is

8

regularly attempting to collect debts owed or due

9

another.

10

The answer to that question is plainly no,

11

because such an entity is attempting to collect debts

12

owed or due itself.

13

Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I just want to

14

understand this.

15

had said that your other side's claim that this was a

16

debt collector entity failed because they didn't allege

17

that this was their principal business.

18

that the principal business of your client is to collect

19

debts that are owed to others.

20
21
22
23
24
25

Okay?

I thought the decision below

So let's assume

Would your position be that they're exempted
from the Act simply because this debt they own?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

No, we would not contend

that, Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if your client, if

they had pled it right and proven that the principal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

part of your client's business was debt collection of

2

debts owed to others, you would be covered.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So Petitioners concede that

4

we do not fall within the principal purpose definition.

5

I would note parenthetically that the principal purpose

6

definition applies to any entity, the principal purpose

7

of whose business is the collection of any debts,

8

regardless of to whom those debts are owed.

9

I would also note parenthetically that, to

10

the extent that Mr. Russell advances an alternative

11

argument, this argument concerning Santander's alleged

12

servicing activity, that that's also an argument under

13

the provision at issue here; namely, the "regularly

14

collects" provision.

15

the "regularly collects" provision, I don't think that

16

Petitioners really dispute that ours is the most natural

17

interpretation of that provision.

And with regard to the language of

18

As I understand Petitioners' arguments, both

19

in their briefs and now at oral argument today, they are

20

really making two principle arguments.

21

this argument concerning the exclusions; that our

22

interpretation somehow renders certain exclusions from

23

the definition of debt collector nonsensical.

24

second is a policy argument, an argument that if

25

Congress had focused on this issue, Congress would have

Alderson Reporting Company

The first is

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

wanted to regulate debt purchasers as well as dedicated

2

debt collectors and servicers.

3

And I hope over the course of this argument

4

to cover both of those points, but let me go directly to

5

this point concerning the exclusions, because I think

6

that really was the focus of Mr. Russell's argument this

7

morning.

8
9

We believe that our interpretation not only
gives meaning to those exclusions, which is all that's

10

really required, but actually gives those exclusions

11

Congress's intended meaning.

12

exclusion in Clause (F)(iv), which got comparatively

13

little treatment in Petitioners' opening brief, but now

14

appears really to be the centerpiece of Petitioners'

15

argument.

And let me start with the

16

We believe that that exclusion has meaning,

17

and indeed has Congress's intended meaning, with regard

18

to a type of financing to which Mr. Russell alluded, so

19

called accounts receivable financing.

20

circumstances in which a secured party could attempt to

21

collect on debts even before they foreclose on the

22

collateral because, of course, once a secured party

23

forecloses on the collateral, it is essentially in the

24

same position as a debt purchaser.

25

And these are

Let's take Mr. Russell's example.

Alderson Reporting Company

Let's

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

suppose you have a situation where a car dealership --

2

let's call it Sam's Cars -- comes to my client,

3

Santander, and says, we'd like to borrow some money.

4

And Santander says in response, fine, what are you going

5

to put up as collateral?

6

going to put up these accounts receivable that we have,

7

and we're going to give you, Santander, the entitlement,

8

in order to pay off this loan, to collect some or all of

9

the money owed on those accounts receivable.

10

And Sam's Cars says, we're

In that circumstance, Santander certainly

11

could be said to have obtained rights in the debt.

12

the debt is still owed or due Sam's Cars in the relevant

13

sense.

14

that circumstance, the creditor retains an interest in

15

the accounts, it retains the right to demand payments on

16

those accounts as well.

17

But

It's still owed or due Sam's Cars because in

And this is a situation that Congress seems

18

to have expressly contemplated.

19

of the Court who are interested in legislative history,

20

or might be tempted to be interested in legislative

21

history, I'd point to the Senate report at page 4 where

22

it says that this exemption targets, quote, "the

23

collection of debts owed to a creditor when the creditor

24

is holding the receivable account as collateral for

25

commercial credit extended to the creditor."

And for those members

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

And so Congress seemed to contemplate a

2

circumstance in which the secured party would be engaged

3

in collection activity even before it foreclosed on the

4

collateral.

5

in footnote 4 of Petitioners' reply brief, I think

6

Petitioners essentially acknowledged that this was a

7

type of financing that is contemplated and that is

8

potentially covered by this exclusion.

9

sources the Petitioners cite in the Uniform Commercial

And if you take a look at the sources cited

And the very

10

Code, again, contemplate the possibility that the

11

secured party could be taking action even before default

12

and foreclosure.

13

And in particular --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think -- I might not have

15

this right, but I think that they're replying to that is

16

what happens in the situation that you mentioned is that

17

the initial creditor who sold the car or whatever, and

18

they're going to give as collateral that.

19

the -- the person who takes the collateral, say

20

Santander, takes an assignment of the debt.

21

They get --

And they're saying taking an assignment of

22

the debt, once that happens, it isn't true that the car

23

buyer owes anything to the car dealer.

24

it right -- good bet, maybe, maybe not -- but if it's --

25

if it's true -- that's true, then he is not collecting

Alderson Reporting Company

But if I've got

Official - Subject to Final Review

33

the debt for another.

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Am I right about what you

think his reply is?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

6

Mr. Russell's reply.

7

this concept of assignment.

8
9

So --

Well, I think that that is

And Mr. Russell really fixates on

But as you pointed out and as Justice Alito
pointed out, assignment is neither here nor there with

10

regard to this exclusion.

11

appears only once in the FDCPA, that is in the assignee

12

exclusion to the creditor definition, which I think both

13

sides acknowledge is not dispositive of the inquiry

14

here.

15

The concept of assignment

I think that the dispositive consideration

16

is whether the servicer in the context of

17

Clause (F)(iii) or the secured party in the context of

18

Clause (F)(iv) acquires complete ownership or acquires

19

something less than that.

20

And I think that when Congress used the word

21

"obtain" in both of these provisions, it was

22

contemplating the full panoply of arrangements where an

23

entity could obtain something less than full ownership.

24
25

And so to move to Clause (F)(iii), and I
think the analysis is analogous under both Clauses,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

there are all sorts of ways in which an assignment --

2

excuse me -- a servicing arrangement could be

3

structured.

4

structured is through a so-called assignment for

5

collection, the type of arrangement that this Court

6

considered, albeit in a quite different context, in the

7

Sprint Communications case where you have the original

8

entity retaining equitable title, but passing legal

9

title to the entity that engages in collection.

And one of the ways in which it could be

And so

10

if a servicer had legal title but not complete title,

11

the servicer would, of course, come within the

12

exclusion.

13

And so, again, we think that with regard to

14

both of these exclusions, we're really giving these

15

exclusions their intended meaning, because Congress

16

wanted to ensure that where you have a servicer or where

17

you have a secured party that engages in collection

18

activity when either of those entities has not acquired

19

full ownership, that there is an exemption from the

20

statute in the context of servicers.

21

only applies to pre-defaulted debt, but in both

22

circumstances, the exclusions have meaning.

23

That exemption

And that's really all that is required when

24

the -- by far the more natural reading of the relevant

25

statutory provision is ours.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

And I do want to take just a minute to

2

address that provision, because we shouldn't lose sight

3

of it, because after all, it's what this Court has been

4

asked to interpret.

5

I want to go directly to the hypotheticals

6

that Mr. Russell has offered today, and they're

7

hypotheticals both of which appear in his reply brief,

8

and explain why the language of those hypotheticals

9

differs in critical respects from the language that we

10

have here.

11

are both at page 4 of the reply brief -- of a statute

12

that refers to a person who regularly creates debts

13

created by another.

14

brief, we believe that the grammatical way to express

15

that view would be to say a person who regularly

16

collects debts that had been created by another.

17

The first is the hypothetical -- and these

Now, of course, as we argue in our

think that hypothetical is distinct in a very important

way.

21

past.

22

collecting debts as they are being created.

23

necessarily think, well, that debt had been created at

24

some prior time.

25

The act of creation is a discrete act, and it's an

It would be very odd to talk about regularly
You would

The word "owed", by contrast, refers to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

status of a debt.

2

be very different from the status of the debt at an

3

earlier time.

4

very different from the language we have here.

5

With regard to Mr. Russell's other

And the current status of a debt may

And so that language, again, I think, is

6

hypothetical, the hypothetical of the statute that

7

covers a person who regularly collects debts owed or

8

owing another, we explain in our brief that "owed" and

9

"owing" are words that are essentially used synonymously

10

and have come to have the same meaning.

11

think that that would be a circumstance in which

12

Congress could be using a doublet that is essentially

13

superfluous, much like a phrase like "aid and abet" or

14

"cease and desist" or "null and void" and many other

15

examples that this Court has cited in the past.

16

And so I do

But, again, even if you disagreed with that,

17

the only reason why you would be saying that "owed"

18

is -- refers to a different tense is in an effort to

19

give meaning to that word.

20

By contrast here, we have a phrase "debts

21

owed or due another."

22

there's much difference in meaning, if any, between the

23

words "owed" or "due."

24

appear together in various permutations, both in other

25

statutes and at common law.

Again, we don't think that

And indeed, those words often

It may very well be that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

the words have a subtly different meaning because, as we

2

explain in a footnote of our brief, it is possible to

3

talk about a debt being owed, but not yet due.

4

And so if I receive a credit card bill from

5

my credit card company and it says that I have to make a

payment by May the 15th, that debt -- debt is indeed

7

presently owed, but not yet due.

9

But what you can't get from this statutory
language -- and, again, even if you agreed with

10

98 percent of Mr. Russell's argument, I don't think you

11

can get over the last 2 percent.

12

statutory language the fact that "owed" and "due" refer

13

to different points in time.

14

Mr. Russell's interpretation, it would be as if the

15

statute reached any person who attempts to -- regularly

16

attempts to collect debts that had been owed or are due

17

another.

18

You can't get from the

In other words, under

And the reason why Mr. Russell puts those

19

two terms into difference -- different reference points

20

is simply because if both of those terms referred back

21

to the point of origination, you really would have a

22

superfluidity problem with the statute.

23

you would render the originator exclusion in

24

Clause (F)(ii) wholly superfluous.

25

At that point,

But the problem with the interpretation that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

Petitioners now proffer is that, again, you have to take

2

this additional step of having these two words refer to

3

different points in time.

4

the use of the word "owed" could refer to two different

5

points in time, you wouldn't be able to take that

6

additional step of saying that "due" refers to a

7

different time from "owed."

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And even if you thought that

Mr. Shanmugam, it doesn't

make much sense, though, does it?

I mean, take this

10

very case.

11

counted as a debt collector at that time.

12

client purchased the debt and all of a sudden is not a

13

debt collector.

14

happened in between the time when your client serviced

15

the debt and the time when your client purchased the

16

debt that in any way changed its relationship with the

17

borrower such that Congress wouldn't be concerned any

18

longer with its behavior?

19

So your clients serviced this debt and
And then your

And I guess the question is:

MR. SHANMUGAM:

What

So, Justice Kagan, we don't

20

concede that simply by virtue of the fact that we

21

serviced Petitioners' debt and certain other debts

22

involved in this case that that was sufficient to render

23

us an entity that regularly collects or attempts --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let's assume that for the --

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But -- but I'm happy to

assume that for purposes of the question.

3

The relevant inquiry is whether we were a

4

debt collector at the time of the alleged violation.

5

you take a look at the substantive provisions of the

6

FDCPA, provisions like 1692e and -f, they're all keyed

7

off conduct engaged in by an entity that is a debt

8

collector.

9

have to be a debt collector at that time.

10

If

And I think the fair inference is that you

And, notably, at the point at which we

11

acquired essentially the remainder of Citi's auto

12

lending business, we really stepped into Citi's shoes in

13

a practically significant way.

14

over the business, and it was as if we were the original

15

creditor.

16

At that point, we took

And while this is not in the record, I hope

17

the Court will permit me one liberty.

18

notices to borrowers, we obviously sent out those

19

noticers in -- notices in Santander's own name.

20

that point, it was as if we had all of the same

21

incentives as the originator of the debt.

22

had an incentive to ensure payment, but we also had an

23

incentive to maintain a business relationship with those

24

customers.

25

When we sent out

And at

We certainly

And so -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, why is -- why

is that?

2

different business than -- than the person that -- in

3

whose shoes you stepped.

4

you -- they've already got the loans.

5

you have the same incentives to maintain their goodwill.

6

I mean, you're -- you -- you were an entirely

I don't see that -- and -- and

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I don't see why

Well, I do think that we

7

would have incentives to maintain their goodwill in the

8

way that the sort of fly-by-night debt collectors that

9

Congress was seeking to target 40 years ago, when it

10

enacted the FDCPA, didn't.

11

to try to market other financial products to their

12

customers.

13

different from Citi, was that, first, as you say, we

14

didn't originate the loans, and, second, we, again,

15

stepped into the shoes of the relationship at a later

16

time.

17

We could have an incentive

And, again, the only sense in which we were

But to the extent that this argument really

18

goes to the broader policy arguments that petitioners

19

are making, and I think petitioners rely on the fact

20

that we were previously servicers, kind of as a door

21

into those policy arguments.

22

Again, we don't think that if Congress had

23

focused on debt purchasers, it would have been concerned

24

about entities like Santander, precisely because --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You don't -- you don't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

think that the definition of "creditor," in excluding

2

only those who have bought debt that's not in default,

3

tells -- gives you a sign of who they are concerned

4

about?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So I think both sides now

6

recognize that the question of whether or not respondent

7

is a debt collector doesn't in any way depend on the

8

question of whether or not respondent falls within the

9

definition of creditor or not.

10
11

Those two provisions

operate perpendicularly.
But I would say that with regard to the

12

definition of "creditor," we believe we would plainly

13

fall within the definition of creditor, because we would

14

be a -- a person to whom a debt is owed.

15

you'll be aware, Justice Sotomayor, in our brief, we

16

rely on the fact that that definition is expressly

17

framed in the present tense, as yet another textual cue

18

as to why our interpretation is correct.

19

Indeed, as

I think with regard to the assignee

20

exclusion from that definition, I think that the one

21

thing I would say is that Petitioners go to great length

22

to suggest that we would fall within that exclusion, but

23

I think that the gymnastics that Petitioners have to go

24

through are much greater than any gymnastics we have to

25

get -- go through to justify our interpretation.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

Because if you take a look at page 49 of

2

Petitioner's brief, they argue that we would fall within

3

the assignee exclusion, which refers to a -- a person

4

who receives an assignment or transfer of a debt in

5

default, solely for the purpose of facilitating

6

collection of such debt for another.

7

To reach even a situation in which an entity

8

is collecting a debt for itself, their argument as to

9

why we would fall within that exclusion is that we would

10

be standing in the shoes of the originator; and,

11

therefore, when we are collecting the debt for

12

ourselves, we are collecting the debt for another, in

13

other words, for an entity other than the originator.

14

And so to the extent that Congress included

15

that exclusion, it works perfectly well under our

16

interpretation.

17

definition of "creditor," because, again, the parties

18

both acknowledge that the definition of creditor sheds

19

little direct light on the interpretation of the

20

definition of "debt collector."

21

This Court need not address the

But in our view, the -- the assignee

22

exclusion in that definition covers situations in which

23

you have either a sham transaction, or a situation in

24

which the assignee, in fact, obtains full title to a

25

debt, but has a contractual obligation, once it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

collects, to pay that money back to the counterparty to

2

the transaction.

3

There's nothing about that exclusion that

4

suggests any intent on Congress's part to reach debt

5

purchasers.

6

Congress was not focusing on debt purchasers in 1977.

7

There was no direct reference to debt purchasers in any

8

of the legislative history, of which we are aware.

9

really what Petitioners are asking this Court to do is

And I think everyone acknowledges that

And

10

to extend the definition of "debt collector" to "debt

11

purchasers," based on these sorts of policy

12

considerations.

And just --

18

what was -- what was the language?

19
20
21

The -- what is

1592(a)(6), the -- not -- not the principle place

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

Justice Ginsburg, this

is the argument.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Regularly -- yeah.

22

Regularly -- the argument, as I understand it, is that

23

one who regularly collects or attempts to collect debts

24

owed to another.

25

we're dealing with, this person who regularly collects

But this particular category that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1
2

or attempts to collect, is a creditor themselves.
That doesn't matter, because if he regularly

3

collects or attempts to collect for another, he is

4

stamped a debt collector, and everything that that debt

5

collector does will be --

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So, Justice Ginsburg, we

7

acknowledge that the question of whether an entity falls

8

within the "regularly collects" definition requires an

9

inquiry into the entity's overall practices.

But what

10

Petitioners are attempting to do is to inject a quite

11

different theory, both legally and factually, as to why

12

we satisfy that definition into this case.

13

If you take a look at the question presented

14

in the petition, the question presented focuses on

15

whether a company -- and I'm quoting from Roman numeral

16

I, "Whether a company that regularly attempts to collect

17

debts it purchased after the debts had fallen into

18

default, is a debt collector subject to the act."

19

Petitioners' alternative theory is that we

20

somehow fall within that definition because of our

21

servicing activity.

22

point to one of our SEC filings for the proposition that

23

we engage in other servicing activity; namely, servicing

24

activity of other debts for other entities.

25

And in particular, Petitioners

Now, that's not within the scope of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

question presented, and as Petitioners acknowledge in

2

their reply brief, that argument was not made in the

3

body of the petition, nor was that the argument that

4

Petitioners made in the lower courts.

5

If you take a look at both the Fourth

6

Circuit's opinion and the briefing in the Fourth Circuit

7

and in the district court, I think that the most that

8

can be said about Petitioners argument is that they made

9

an argument along the lines of what Justice Kagan

10

suggested.

11

fact that we serviced the very debts at issue in this

12

case, that there would be something inequitable, as a

13

policy matter, about saying that by virtue of that

14

servicing activity, we're now no longer within the scope

15

of the statute.

16

They made an argument that by virtue of the

I think what Petitioners are trying to do

17

here, is quite different.

18

an argument that by virtue of, again, our other

19

servicing activity, that is sufficient to bring us

20

within the ambit of the definition.

21

allegation in the complaint, which you can see for

22

yourself in the Joint Appendix, to that effect, and that

23

has never been Petitioners' theory in this case.

24
25

They are attempting to make

And there is no

And I would make one parenthetical note
about that.

Even if you thought that as a -- a court of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

first view, you could somehow take judicial notice of

2

these SEC filings or anything else in an effort to

3

bolster this now long-forfeited argument, the relevant

4

inquiry for purposes of the definition of "debt

5

collector" concerns our activities at the time we

6

engaged in the alleged violations, as I noted earlier.

7

Those violations are alleged to have taken

8

place five years ago, and I can represent to this Court

9

that Santander's business was, in some respects, very

10

different.

11

servicing activity in 2012 than it does today.

12

And in particular, Santander had much less

All of this, of course, would be a matter to

13

be alleged in the complaint, if that were, in fact,

14

Petitioners' alternative theory as to how we qualify as

15

a definition of debt collector.

16

every opportunity, in every court along the way, to

17

advance that theory, and yet, they put all of their eggs

18

in one basket when they came to this Court, and

19

attempted to argue that we qualify as a debt collector

20

solely by virtue of our purchases.

21

And Petitioners had

And under the more natural interpretation of

22

the relevant statutory language:

23

such purchases simply do not count toward whether or not

24

an entity is engaged in regularly collecting debts owed

25

or due another.

Such purchasers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But wouldn't we, assuming

2

we agree with you, have to leave open that -- the

3

question of the character of the business, the sixth

4

definition.

5

but there might be another person similarly situated who

6

wanted to ride with that argument.

7

It's true it's not raised before us here,

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Ginsburg, I think

8

that that is an issue that could be raised in another

9

case.

Our submission is simply that it can't be raised

10

in this case, because it has been forfeited.

11

entirely contrary to the argument that Petitioners make

12

in their reply brief, they seem to suggest that -- that

13

this is something that we're advancing as an alternative

14

ground for affirmance.

15

be an alternative ground for reversal.

16

That is not correct.

And

This would

If you were to give Petitioners another bite

17

at the apple to pursue this theory, you would have to

vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand

19

on that ground and allow Petitioners at this late stage

in the litigation to amend their complaint in order to

21

provide factual support for that argument.

giving a litigant that opportunity when they have had

24

every opportunity to do so in the lower courts but have

25

Alderson Reporting Company

And I'm

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

At the point at which we moved to dismiss in

2

the district court on the ground that Petitioners had

3

not satisfied the element of liability that we be a debt

4

collector, that was the point at which you would expect

5

Petitioners to seek leave to amend if they wanted to

6

pursue a theory not within the four corners of their

7

complaint, and they can conspicuously did not do so

8

there, nor did they ask the court of appeals for that

9

opportunity.

10

Let me just say --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Court of appeals did

12

address the issue, but it said even under this

13

"regularly collects," it would have to be a debt owed

14

to -- what are the magic words?

15

Well, first tell me, am I right that the

16

alternative argument that was not raised here was

17

raised --

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I actually don't think that

19

it was raised below or passed upon by the court of

20

appeals.

21

court of appeals' opinion is that it passed on what is

22

effectively a policy argument, though it has a factual

23

premise to it; namely, this argument that by, virtue of

24

the fact that we serviced this relatively small number

25

of debts at issue, that there would be something

I think the most that can be said about the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

inequitable about saying that we are no longer a debt

2

collector once we have acquired those debts.

3

argument that the court of appeals is addressing at

4

pages 18A to 19A of the appendix to the petition.

5

That's the

Now, I will note one thing about the court

6

of appeals' opinion.

7

language in that carryover paragraph that seems to

8

suggest that the question of whether or not an entity is

9

a debt collector focuses on the particular debts at

I think that there is some

10

issue, and I think we would respectfully acknowledge

11

that that's not quite correct.

12

principal purpose definition, or the regularly collects

13

definition, you certainly have to look at the entity's

14

overall operations.

15

Under either the

And as we explain in our brief, the question

16

of whether a certain type of activity is sufficient to

17

give rise to regular collection has been the subject of

18

some discussion in the lower courts.

19

better view that this relies largely on district court

20

opinions because there's very little circuit authority

21

on this, is that in assessing whether an entity

22

regularly collects debts owed or due another, you have

23

to look at those debts in relation to the entities'

24

overall collection activities and determine whether that

25

collection activity is a substantial part of the

Alderson Reporting Company

We think that the

Official - Subject to Final Review

50

entities' overall collection activities.

2

But that is an issue that would have to be

3

resolved if Petitioners had relied on this alternative

4

servicing theory below.

5

Court, if it were to give Petitioners another

6

opportunity to pursue that theory, would probably have

7

to say something about that, or at a minimum, leave that

8

issue open for the lower courts.

broader submission with regard to this alternative

And I would submit that this

And of course, our

10

theory is that it was not preserved before this Court at

11

the cert stage, nor was it preserved in the lower

12

courts.

13

I see that my yellow light is on, so I just

14

want to say one last thing on this issue of the policy

15

arguments, because I certainly don't want the Court to

16

be left with the impression that if Congress had focused

17

on this issue, it surely would have wanted to bring debt

18

purchasers within the scope of the statute.

19

Petitioners raise this suggestion of

20

horribles that there are various diversified financial

21

institutions that are moving into the secondary market

22

for distressed debt.

23

true as a factual matter, and I would encourage the

24

Court to look at the secondary sources that Petitioners

25

cite for that proposition at page 9 of opening brief and

I simply don't think that that's

evidence that the Goldman Sachs's and the Blackstones of

3

There simply is no

But the problem with Petitioners'

6

interpretation is that it really would sweep in entities

like Santander.

9

not buying distressed debt on some secondary market.

And again, if you take a look at the

It

11

where it essentially acquired the entirety of Citi's

12

auto lending business, both nondefaulted and defaulted

14

shoes in that regard.

15

And so while this may not have been a

16

transaction of the sort that Justice Breyer posited

where you have an entity that's truly a successor in

interest, it's a pretty close cousin to that source --

MR. SHANMUGAM:

My understanding is that

22

Citi in very much still in business, but it's not in the

23

auto lending business, and that Santander, in two

24

separate transactions, acquired somewhere in the

25

neighborhood of $6.5 billion worth of auto loans.

Alderson Reporting Company

52

Citi, like many other large lenders,

2

essentially got out of the auto lending business in the

3

wake of the last financial crisis, and Santander

4

acquired this entire portfolio.

5

illustrates, I think, why Congress may not have wanted

6

to bring debt purchasers, or at least all debt

7

purchasers, within the ambit of the statute.

8
9

And so this case really

And again, if you take a look at the
secondary market for distressed debt, which is a very

10

large market, most of the purchasers on that market

11

would qualify as debt collectors under the principal

purpose definition.

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RUSSELL:

Thank you.

So let me end by

responding to Respondent's last point.
We know that Congress would have intended to

20

sweep these financial services companies into the

21

coverage under that because it did.

22

alternative argument; explains why, so long as these

23

companies are also servicing debts for others, they are

24

subject to the Act.

25

the Clause (F) exception.

That's our

They are debt collectors subject to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

So when they acquire portfolio debt, the

2

Clause (F)(ii) exception -- (F)(iii) exception exempts

3

them with respect to all portfolio debts that were

4

current at the time that they obtained them.

5

Justice Kagan, we give examples on page 4 of

6

our reply brief of abuses, one of which is an applicant

7

who discloses every debt owed by a foreign creditor,

8

which I think would be ambiguous with respect to others

9

owed in the past or owed in the current time frame.

10
11
12

And I think it's important here to keep in
mind -- let me return to Clause (iv) just for a second.
Respondent's only argument, which is a new

13

one that they've thought of in the interim before filing

14

the brief and doing this oral argument, is that (iv) is

15

about a circumstance in which somebody is collecting a

16

debt based on collateral.

17

notification and non-notification accounts receivable

18

financials, financial lending.

19

These are sometimes called

Justice Breyer, I'm afraid I'm going to ask

20

you to actually look at the UCC and to look at how these

21

things are -- are done, because they are always done

22

through an assignment.

23

debt up front, and as a consequence, the person, the

24

lender, is always collecting the debt on the basis of

25

assignment, on its own account, exactly like a debt

There is an assignment of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

54

purchaser.

2

Their proposed solution to (F)(iv) simply

3

doesn't work.

4

a circumstance in which (F)(iv) has any work to do or

5

makes any coherent sense on Respondent's definition of

6

owed or due another.

7

And nobody has been able to come up with

Last point I would like to make is their

8

interpretation allows quite easy evasion, even by

9

third-party debt collectors who we know Congress wanted

10

to get at.

11

Justice Alito, a third-party debt collector to evade the

12

statutes so long as it is hired to collect the debt

13

before the debt goes into default, even once it's

14

delinquent.

15

It allows, as I discussed with

It allows a servicer, who would otherwise be

16

covered by the Act because they obtained the debt in

17

default, to avoid it so long as they simply receive an

18

assignment of the debt for collection purposes, because

19

somebody who is assigned the debt is collecting a debt

20

owed and due themselves, not owed and due another.

21

we don't think that Congress could have intended that.

22

And

And even with respect to a small number -- a

23

smaller number of third-party debt collectors who are

24

not falling under the Principal Purpose Clause -- can I

25

finish?
