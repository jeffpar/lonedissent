CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in case 16-54, Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions.
Mr. Fisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The key statutory term of the INA in this

11

case is the word "abuse."

12

criminalizing sexual abuse of a minor, as well as the

13

State statutes dealing with the same subject, dictate

14

that sexual relations become abuse only -- on account of

15

age, only when the younger partner in the activity is

16

younger than 16.

17

And the Federal statute

At the very least, the Federal and State

18

laws that I just mentioned dictate that California

19

statute is well outside of that which Congress would

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

MR. FISHER:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm --

-- have expected.
I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher.

You

23

just said something that I think you did not say in your

24

briefs, so let me ask you about that.

25

You just gave us your definition of what the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

generic offense is.

2

understood in your briefs you just said whatever the

3

generic offense is, it doesn't include this activity.

4

But do you have a definition of what the generic offense

5

is?

It's understand 16. Because I

And if so, did you just say it?

6

MR. FISHER:

Justice Kagan, what we think is

7

that if you want to give a definition for sexual abuse

8

of a minor, at least in the context of the allegation of

9

abuse being due to age, that 16 would be the appropriate

10

cutoff.

11

response to the government's point that, at least its

12

arguments, that you need to go further than we argued in

13

our blue brief.

And we do say that in our reply brief in

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you have any further

15

views of what the generic offense is?

16

elements of the generic offense that you're willing to

17

tell us you think?

18

first we define the generic offense, and then we see

19

whether the State statute in question fits within that

20

or doesn't.

21
22
23

Are there other

I mean usually, in these cases,

And so what is the generic offense?
under 16.

It's

Anything else?
MR. FISHER:

There are four elements,

24

Justice Kagan.

25

it has to be abuse, has to involve a minor, and then

There -- it has to be sexual in nature,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

presumably there's some mens rea involved.

2

those are four elements.

I think

3

And so what we think is enough to decide

4

this case -- in fact, it's more than is necessary to

5

decide this case -- is to say, when dealing with the

6

elements of abuse, and the allegation is solely because

7

of the ages of the partners engaging in sexual relations

8

you have abuse, then 16 should be the age of consent.

9

Now, we didn't go that far in parts of our

10

briefing because we don't think the Court has to go that

11

far.

12

where the Court has said, we'll just look at a

13

particular element and say that as long as the State

14

statute falls outside of that element, that's enough.

15

So you could decide this case by saying that the seven

16

states that have laws like California's, at issue here,

17

but draw the age of consent at 18, automatically fall

18

outside of sexual abuse of a minor.

19

the seven states that have those laws, most of them are

20

misdemeanors, and only one of those seven states calls

21

that conduct abuse.

22

In Duenas-Alvarez and other cases are examples

JUSTICE ALITO:

And, remember, even

Suppose that there were

23

no -- that the definition here -- the phrase here had no

24

criminal application.

25

immigration; okay?

So it applies purely in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

MR. FISHER:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

Uh-huh.
And you're not asking us to

overrule Chevron.

4

MR. FISHER:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, no, no.
All right.

So why wouldn't

6

this phrase, "sexual abuse of a minor," be a phrase that

7

is sufficiently ambiguous to justify Chevron?

8

order to get around that, do you have to invoke

9

something like the rule of lenity?

10
11

MR. FISHER:

We have other arguments,

Justice Alito.

12
13

No.

Now, in

JUSTICE ALITO:

So that -- that is not an

ambiguous phrase by itself, "sexual abuse of a minor"?

14

MR. FISHER:

Not in the way you've defined

15

"ambiguity," both in the categorical approach cases and

16

for purposes of Chevron.

17

one.

18

So let me turn to those one by

In the categorical approach cases, starting

19

with Taylor, when the Court had confronted a generic

20

crime without a specific cross-reference definition,

21

what the Court has done is look across the sweep of

22

State laws and Federal laws criminalizing that conduct.

23

In a case like Perrin, where there were 42 states that

24

had a common core definition, the Court explicitly said

25

in a footnote in that case there's no ambiguity involved

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

in that situation, because we assume it's sufficiently

2

clear that that's what Congress would have been

3

intending to cover.

4

Even if I didn't win that argument --

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you think that if we

6

look at this incredible array of State laws, it becomes

7

clear what Congress intended by "sexual abuse of a

8

minor"?

9

MR. FISHER:

Well, we think "yes" for two

10

reasons.

11

the very legislation this provision in the INA was

12

enacted, Congress amended Section 2243 of the criminal

13

code that uses precisely the same language, "sexual

14

abuse of a minor."

15

Federal criminal law when Congress was criminalizing

16

this conduct.

17

that is enough right there to find no ambiguity and to

18

find a common --

19

One is because, remember, Justice Alito, in

So it is a precise definition in

So I think the Court could actually hold

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -- well, before --

20

before you continue your answer and get into Chevron,

21

why -- suppose that there were -- the Federal statute is

22

the only one on the books.

23

are -- are different.

24

control, still?

25

All the other State statutes

Would the Federal statute then

MR. FISHER:

I think that would be a harder

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

case, Justice Kennedy.

2

situation is, did you have an explicit or implicit

3

cross-reference?

4

believe in that hypothetical that Congress was thinking

5

of only the Federal version of the crime?

6

are strong reasons here to think that, for the reasons I

7

was just describing.

8

Kennedy.

9

What you'd have to ask in that

Is there strong-enough reason to

But this is the easy case, Justice

So -JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why would you think

10

that, Mr. Fisher?

11

there are loads of cross-references.

12

not a cross-reference.

13

something?

14

I think there

I mean, there -- in this statute,

MR. FISHER:

And this one is

So doesn't that tell us

It's -- it's -- it's a canon,

15

Justice Kagan.

16

the immigration defense brief at page 13 posits a theory

17

as to why Congress may not have included a

18

cross-reference here where it did other places, and it

19

has to do with the jurisdictional nature of the element

20

in the Federal crime.

21

I -- I will concede that.

But the --

But even if you set that aside, what you

22

have is one canon, and you have other canons and another

23

canon that's very strong through the Court's cases.

24

when Congress uses the identical phrase multiple places

25

in the same legislation, we assume it meant the same

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

thing.

2

And so that would be my argument, primarily,

3

as to why Congress here may well have been thinking of

4

Section 2243.

5

Kennedy, this is the easy case.

6

Section 2243 and the State multi-jurisdictional survey

7

plus the Model Penal Code leads you to the exact same

8

place.

9

where those two things line up, it is certainly the case

But as I was just describing to Justice
This is the case where

So it's enough in this case to say, at least

10

that Congress would not have been intending to sweep in

11

a State statute like the one involved here.

12

You can leave for another day what might

13

happen in a hypothetical statute like Justice Kennedy

14

described, or even on this statute if you had a

15

situation where states covered certain conduct and

16

treated it as abuse that falls outside of Section 2243.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do we do with

18

Chevron if we think it's ambiguous?

19

MR. FISHER:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. FISHER:

So -And it's not clear?

If you think -- I want to make

22

sure I understand the question.

23

text is not clear for the reasons I've described so

24

far --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you think that the

Exactly.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

MR. FISHER:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

Then you would go -Or sufficiently

unambiguous, to be --

4

MR. FISHER:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

MR. FISHER:

Fair enough.
-- to be clear.

Then what I think you would do

7

is have one more set of questions you ask before you ask

8

the traditional Chevron reasonableness questions.

9

that would be whether a traditional -- another

10

traditional canon of construction resolves the

11

ambiguity.

12

And

The Solicitor General acknowledges at

13

page 42 of its brief that other clear statement rules

14

and, of course, juris prudence, like the presumption

15

against preemption, the presumption against

16

retroactivity, come before you get to agency deference.

17

Likewise here, there are two such canons.

18

One is the rule of lenity, which Justice Alito

19

mentioned.

20

Thompson-Center Arms Company and more recently in the

21

Abramski case, you have the separation of powers problem

22

by deferring on Chevron grounds to a statute like this

23

one that applies both in the civil and criminal realm.

24
25

And we think for the reasons in

And, secondly, even if you set that aside -and I think that was Justice Alito's hypothetical --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

then you'd have the -- the long-standing rule on

2

immigration law, which predates Chevron by decades, that

3

says deportation statutes, if they're ambiguous, should

4

be construed in the favor of the --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but we've

6

always said, though, that the rule of lenity, or at

7

least most often said that the rule of lenity is

8

something you apply when you've already exhausted the

9

normal tools of statutory interpretation.

So why is the

10

order of a battle the other way around?

11

apply the rule of lenity before you get to Chevron?

12

MR. FISHER:

Why do you

Well, I think you've said more

13

or less the same thing in the Chevron context, Mr. Chief

14

Justice.

15

are, first, the Thompson-Center Arms Company case where

16

the Court said, we have an ambiguous statute, and now

17

we're going to turn to lenity, not to Chevron.

18

reason why is because in Chevron itself, the Court said

19

you exhaust all traditional canons because you assume

20

Congress legislated against those canons.

21

more traditional canon of construction than the criminal

22

rule of lenity.

And the two things that I would cite to you

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MR. FISHER:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the

There is no

But I --

I --

Alderson Reporting Company

-- I don't know how

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

the two of them can coexist.

2

you have in Chevron, you give the agency the broadest

3

possible deference to interpret an ambiguous provision.

4

And in the rule of lenity, you say, well, if it's

5

ambiguous, you don't apply it as strictly as -- as the

6

government may be arguing.

7

opposite direction based on the same predicate, which is

8

a degree of ambiguity in the statutory provision.

9

MR. FISHER:

I mean, on the one hand,

They each point in the

I think that premise is

10

correct.

11

couple of terms ago, answers that problem by saying it

12

would be a separation of powers violation to let the

13

executive define -- define criminal statutes.

14

we --

And I think the Abramski case, from just a

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Remember,

Are you suggesting,

16

Mr. Fisher, that if we turn Chevron off, we have to turn

17

lenity on?

18

the two; in other words, some space where you say,

19

because of this -- the -- the criminal application of

20

this statute, we don't apply ordinary Chevron deference,

21

but at the same time, we don't go straight into the kind

22

of grievous ambiguity that -- that triggers lenity?

23

There's some middle area where the Court gets to decide

24

just what is -- it thinks is the best construction of

25

the statute?

Couldn't there be a middle ground between

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1
2
3

MR. FISHER:

It's hard for me to imagine

exactly how that works, but I'm happy with the -JUSTICE KAGAN:

It works -- it works, if you

4

think that ambiguity doesn't necessarily mean the same

5

thing for Chevron purposes and for lenity purposes.

6

MR. FISHER:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I would -The lenity purposes really

8

demands grievous ambiguity, and but there's some sense

9

in which there's -- there's a of lack clarity, a lack of

10

clear meaning that allows the Court to decide what the

11

best interpretation of the language is.

12

MR. FISHER:

So if that were the situation

13

here, what I would tell the Court is when you do that

14

job as a court, you should take into account for any

15

ambiguity the rule against construing deportation

16

statutes against noncitizens.

17

you should --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, more generally, what

I don't really understand

19

that -- that canon, because that canon would suggest

20

that we never give the BIA deference as to its

21

interpretation of this statute.

22

comes to noncriminal things, we give the BIA very

23

substantial deference.

24
25

MR. FISHER:
INA, Justice Kagan.

And, in fact, when it

You have in other parts of the

But the Court never deferred to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

INA in terms of construing what an aggravated felony is

2

for purposes of deportation.

3

the Court said that that canon applied in -- with

4

respect to, quote, deportation statutes.

5

you set that aside and just -- I'd be more than happy

6

for the Court simply to ask what the best reading of

7

this statute is on its own terms.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

And in the same sphere,

But even if

Can I take you back to

9

the -- the argument that Chevron isn't appropriate here

10

because the definition applies in both the criminal and

11

the civil context?

12

Sutton made in his dissent, and it has kind of a -- it's

13

an appealing argument when you say it fast.

14

more I think of it, the less sense --

And that was the point that Judge

But the

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

Now suppose that a -- there's an ambiguous

-- the less sense it makes.

18

phrase in an immigration statute, and it applies only in

19

the civil -- it applies only in immigration and has no

20

criminal -- has no criminal applications.

21

that in that situation it would be appropriate to use

22

Chevron, okay, and then later Congress uses the same

23

phrase in a criminal statute.

And suppose

24

Does that mean that the Chevron

25

deference that was applied in the civil -- previously in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

the civil context goes away?

2

MR. FISHER:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think it -I -- I don't see anything

4

odd about having the same phrase interpreted using a

5

different methodology in a civil case and in a criminal

6

case.

7

MR. FISHER:

I think it would go away and,

8

Justice Alito, I just cite this Court's case law to you.

9

Clark against Martinez is the foremost example, but

10

there's Thompson Center Arms Company.

11

ago, FCC against ABC, and the Court has said over and

12

over again that statutes are not chameleons.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

There are decades

Well -- but I would like to

14

know why it makes sense, so something other than a

15

citation of cases, why would Chevron deference be

16

appropriate up to the point where Congress decides to

17

use the same phrase in a criminal statute and then it

18

disappears.

19
20

MR. FISHER:
separation of powers.

Because it would violate the

today, don't include a criminal sanction?

12

MR. FISHER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Almost all of them do.

15

MR. FISHER:

It's --- in part or in whole?

So where would Chevron be then?
I'm not sure empirically that's

16

correct.

17

here's what I would say about the kinds of cases I think

18

you're thinking of, Justice Sotomayor, where the Court

19

hasn't even thought about this issue, and the reason why

20

is because in those cases Congress has made it a crime

21

to violate a regulation issued by whatever agency has

22

control over that statute.

23

defined the crime, which is violating a regulation.

I think it's more of an unusual situation, but

So there Congress has

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- most of the

regulations are interpretations of the statute.

3

MR. FISHER:

That's right, but Congress has

4

created the crime of violating the regulation.

5

like if Congress says it's a crime to violate a court

6

order and the court issues an order, the court isn't

7

creating criminal law.

Congress did.

You don't have to accept my

view.

it -- and I'm curious to know what you actually think

16

about it.

My -- I may be the only one with this view, but

You have cases here a lot.
Chevron is not the tax code.

We are not --

18

it is not a rule of tax law.

19

standard which has judges asking what Congress would

20

have thought about a question they never thought about,

21

which is what kind of deference should a court give to

22

an agency interpretation, and the answer will vary

23

depending upon statute.

24
25

It is a general kind of

I would not even give you this lecture were
it not for the case that I believe this Court wrote this

Official - Subject to Final Review

18

view into its opinion in Mead, which I think is pretty

2

good law.

3

would a reasonable legislature think about that

4

question, which he never thought of, it's surprising to

5

me that he would think prosecutors should have deference

I would find surprising some aspects of

I already

I want to know what you think.

MR. FISHER:

What -- what I think and what

we're asking for today, if the Court reached the

question, is for a very small exception to Chevron.

be very, very hard --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The reason -I -- I -- most of the

crimes that are -- are set out in regulation almost

largely parrot the statutory language.

what the agency means and it makes it a crime to violate

7

the regulation which is really the statute.

8

distinction without meaning for me.

9

MR. FISHER:

And then explain

So it's a

So two -- so two things about

10

that situation, Justice Sotomayor.

11

you're just parroting the statutory language you don't

12

need Chevron at all, and the second answer is, if you

13

get to -- the only thing that matters is where the

14

agency is reading a statute under Chevron in a way that

15

is not the better reading.

16

all the --

17
18
19

The first is, if

And in that situation almost

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's if its

reading unreasonable.
MR. FISHER:

Almost all -- that's right.

20

Almost all the examples you're thinking of are ones

21

where Congress has delegated the authority to create

22

crimes through the regulatory process.

23

Now, you don't have to reach that question

24

in this case.

25

statute is unambiguously clear as the question presented

For all the reasons I started with, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

in this case.

2

of what Federal law, the sweep of State laws, the amount

3

of penal code define sexual abuse of a minor.

4

The California statute falls far outside

Even if you were going to ask the question

5

under the traditional lens of Chevron, was the BIA

6

analysis reasonable, here I think it's helpful to point

7

out a few things.

8

of sexual abuse of a minor looked to a different Federal

9

statute, Section 3509, which is a State -- which is a

First is, the BIA in its definition

10

section about witness testimony.

11

Rodriguez-Rodriguez case in 1999.

This goes back to the

12

The Solicitor General no longer defends that

13

analysis, so the core of the BIA's reasoning that led it

14

to where we are today is something that is not being

15

defended anymore in this Court.

16

thing.

17

So that's the first

The second thing is the BIA totally ignored

18

the State by State sweep, just saying that the lack of a

19

definition isn't enough in the statute itself, but that

20

runs directly into the Taylor case, into Duenas-Alvarez,

21

into all the other categorical approach cases where the

22

Court has said to -- to define a -- a generic crime, you

23

start and see if there's an express definition, but if

24

there isn't that's when you do multi-jurisdictional

25

surveys.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

The other reason --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Multi-jurisdictional

3
4

survey would yield age 16?
MR. FISHER:

Justice Ginsburg, there are

5

two -- there would be two possible answers to your

6

multi-jurisdictional survey.

7

answer is that any State statute like California

8

creating a -- a -- an 18 age of consent with a minor age

9

differential, a very small age differential, would be

The first and the easiest

10

well outside of the mainstream and 43 states do not even

11

criminalize the conduct at issue here, let alone make it

12

a serious crime.

13

Remember, we're asking at the end of the day

14

whether something's an aggravated felony, not just

15

whether it's criminal.

16

here where the -- where the government is trying to

17

deport somebody for committing something that isn't even

18

a crime under Federal and the vast majority of states.

19

You have an extraordinary case

And, Justice Ginsburg, the second answer

20

about a multi-jurisdiction -- jurisdictional survey, if

21

you wanted to give more guidance or felt like the

22

Solicitor General's argument did a more comprehensive

23

definition is necessary was correct, would be the one I

24

started with and I talked to Justice Kagan about, which

25

would be, when you're dealing with an allegation of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

abuse based on the ages alone, that 16 is the age of

2

consent and that is found in Federal law, it's found in

3

the modal Penal Code, it's found in the sweep of State

4

laws.

5

And, Justice, this is what Judge Wilkinson

6

did for the Fourth Circuit in Rangel-Castenada which is

7

cited in our briefs and we think that decision is

8

correct.

9

Even if what you did what the Solicitor

10

General asked you to do, which is ignore all of that and

11

simply pick up Black's Law Dictionary, as we've shown in

12

our reply brief you end up in the same place, because

13

Black's Law Dictionary, when it defines sexual abuse

14

says that it -- we're talking about illegal sexual

15

activity.

16

what the age of consent is, and when you look in Black's

17

Law Dictionary, for the age of consent in this

18

situation, you find the number 16.

19

And to define what is illegal you have to ask

So this is, again, the very easy case where

20

all roads are going to lead you to the same place.

21

don't have any of the interpretative difficulties of the

22

categorical approach that you normally have.

23

You

In fact, there's one other way where this is

24

an easier case than almost all categorical approaches

25

cases that you see.

And that's because the consequences

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1
2

here are so benign.
The ordinary categorical approach situation

3

involves a scenario, I think, where what a court is

4

sometimes worried about is that by virtue of the -- the

5

methodology there would be some State statutes that are

6

a little bit overbroad and that people have done some

7

very bad things that the Federal law would consider to

8

be aggravated felonies are going to get the benefit of

9

the way the categorical approach works and not be

10
11

subject to automatic removal.
And here that problem is taken care of in

12

the State laws like -- in the states like California

13

that have laws that reach up to 18, because as we've

14

shown in Footnote 1 of our reply brief, all of those

15

states have other statutory provisions that are in line

16

with the Federal law or very close to it.

17

So really, all you are dealing with this in

18

this case is a few outlier -- there's actually seven

19

outlier statutes that go further than the Federal aw,

20

and that have backup provisions that are going to still

21

allow the Federal government to seek automatic removal

22

or some other immigration remedy against people that

23

commit sexual offenses against minors.

24
25

Remember, the core -- the core of sexual
abuse of a minor, I think, are things like child

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

molestation and other really horrible things that nobody

2

is even talking about here.

3

is how it applies to offenses like statutory rape.

4

we think, working your way up to the Federal definition

5

of statutory rape, when age alone is the only thing that

6

justifies an allegation of abuse is the right way to

7

resolve that case and not go any further.

8
9

The only issue in this case
And

The Federal government's definition, as I
point out one more thing about it, it doesn't even track

10

the BIA.

11

least as I understand it, is that any sexual activity

12

that's illegal is sexual abuse of a minor, as long as

13

the younger participant is under 18.

It's the Federal government's position, at

14

So under the Federal government's view, as I

15

understand it, the two States that criminalize sex

16

between two 17-year-olds would constitute an aggravated

17

felony.

18

it is not commonly thought of in this country as abuse,

19

and even though it's a misdemeanor in both of those

20

situations.

21

Court, and we think goes far, far, far beyond what

22

Congress might have imagined when it was creating sexual

23

abuse of a minor subcategory.

24
25

Even though only two States do it, even though

That's an extraordinary request out of this

presentation I've made thus far, I'm happy to answer

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Kedem.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8
9

MR. KEDEM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress has charged the Attorney General

10

with responsibility to administer the INA to conduct

11

removal proceedings and to render controlling

12

interpretations of the statute within those proceedings.

13

In this case, the Board of Immigration

14

Appeals exercised that authority in a manner both

15

reasonable and consistent with the statute, and for that

16

reason, should be afforded deference.

17

good place to begin is where Petitioner's counsel began,

18

with the idea of multi-jurisdictional surveys.

19

I think perhaps a

First of all, by my count, there are roughly

20

13 cases in which this Court, under the categorical

21

approach, was called upon to define or give meaning to a

22

Federal provision so that the categorical approach could

23

be applied to it.

24
25

In only two of those cases, Taylor and
Duenas-Alverez, has the Court relied on something that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

could be compared to a multi-jurisdictional survey.

2

all of the other cases, the Court either didn't look at

3

multi-jurisdictional surveys at all or, as in Johnson,

4

basically specifically rejected the relevance of those

5

multi-jurisdictional surveys, saying that they would

6

shed no light on the central inquiry.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In

Well, Mr. Kedem, you don't

8

disagree, do you, with the premise that the first thing

9

that we should do is to define the generic crime; is

10

that right?

11
12

MR. KEDEM:

That's correct.

That's what we

consider to be step one of the categorical approach.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So you say that's

14

step one.

15

the generic -- in this case you say the generic crime is

16

whatever is illegal under State law.

17

your --

18
19

And then you say, well, you define

MR. KEDEM:

That's one of

That's the first argument that

we make in our brief.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

like just not what generic crimes are.

22

MR. KEDEM:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.

So that seems to be

Sure.
In other words, you're just

24

saying, well, it's whatever the States consider illegal,

25

when the whole idea of a generic crime is that it's not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

just anything that's illegal, it's the prototypical

2

case, even though that differs from what some States do.

3

MR. KEDEM:

4

First of all, it's certainly not whatever

Sure.

A -- a couple responses.

5

States make illegal.

6

content that's directed at a minor; namely, someone

7

under the age of 18.

8
9

It still has to have sexual

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

But you're carving out

one element, which is the age element --

10

MR. KEDEM:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure.
-- and saying whatever a

12

State does goes.

13

antithesis of the generic offense approach.

14

So I thought that that was sort of the

MR. KEDEM:

I think not, because what we're

15

dealing here is not one crime.

16

is an umbrella with -- with -- is an umbrella term that

17

applies to several different categories of crime.

18

What we're dealing here

And I think it's maybe most analogous to the

19

Court's Kawashima case in which the Court was

20

interpreting a provision of the INA's aggravated felony

21

definition, which didn't have a cross reference,

22

offenses involving fraud or deceit, which are sort of a

23

broad category of different types of crimes.

24
25

And to figure out what that means, the Court
did not look to a multi-jurisdictional survey.

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

looked to the dictionary, to the context of the

2

provision, to what it understood to be the -- the

3

purpose of the provision and came up with a definition.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now -- now, it looked to

5

Federal law itself 2243(a).

6

final form, it's the same here as -- as this provision.

We're told that, in the

7

MR. KEDEM:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

The same term, sexual

abuse of a minor.

10
11

So --

MR. KEDEM:

A couple -- couple of thoughts

about that provision.

12

First of all, it was adopted more than a

13

decade before the term "sexual abuse of a minor" was

14

added to the INA's definition of aggravated felony.

15

has been amended a number of times, both before and

16

after the amendment that added the aggravated felony of

17

sexual abuse of a minor.

18

It

And the courts did not do what it did in a

19

number of other provisions, which is to include a cross

20

reference.

21

that it did not want to tie the definition of sexual

22

abuse of a minor to that provision.

So if anything, I think the inference is

23

And Petitioner --

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Can you think of a

definition from -- from an evidentiary statute, a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

statute designed to protect children who testify in

2

court.

3

That seems a lot less close than 2243.
MR. KEDEM:

So I -- I don't think it's

4

accurate to characterize the board's decision as

5

treating that as the definition.

6

And I think if you look at the board's

7

opinion, what it said is that is a pretty common-sense

8

definition for the type of activity that might be

9

covered.

But it didn't otherwise rely on it.

And the

10

board's decision below relied instead on a practical

11

construction of the word "abuse," the sort of intuition

12

that there are certain types of activity that, even

13

though they are ostensibly consensual, nevertheless,

14

they contain the potential for harm or risk because of

15

something about the relationship between the parties

16

involved, either the ages of the parties involved, or

17

because there's a familial relationship; for instance,

18

parent/child, or there's a relationship of authority or

19

trust, something like a student/teacher.

20

And what it said is when there's a

21

meaningful age difference, such that the perpetrator and

22

victim are not in the same age group, as a result of

23

that, the victim may not be able to advocate for

24

themselves, they may not be able to protect themselves

25

against certain risks, things like pregnancy or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

sexually-transmitted diseases.

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that was the basis.
Why isn't an 18-year-old

in the same age group as a 21-year-old?

4

MR. KEDEM:

I don't think we're dealing with

5

18-year-olds.

6

about people under the age of 18.

I think in all instances we're talking

7

What the -- the board said --

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

It's really like a freshman

in college going out with a junior in college.

10

MR. KEDEM:

It is true that sometimes there

11

are 17-year-olds who are in college.

12

not the typical instance.

That's certainly

13

I think, to a certain extent, we're dealing

14

with a little bit of arbitrariness, no matter where you

15

draw the line.

16

offense does, you essentially rule out statutes in

17

almost all of the 50 States because, first of all, there

18

are 19 States that set the age of consent either at 18

19

or at 17.

20

most of the remaining ones set the age differential at

21

something less than four years.

22

But if you draw the line, as the Federal

So you'd be ruling them -- them out.

And that's before you get into questions

23

about things like what about the mens rea?

24

to know that the victim was of a certain age.

25

And

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you have

It's quite complicated,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

which I agree.

2

correctly?

3

immigration statute, which is this 1101(a)(43), which

4

lists about 30 or 40 crimes.

5

has committed one of those, goodbye, and the Attorney

6

General can't stop it; is that right?

7

But do I understand the situation

In mid 1990s, Congress passed a law in

MR. KEDEM:

And it says if the person

It's right with this one caveat,

8

which is that the definition of aggravated felony

9

actually came much earlier and has been amended a number

10

of times.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what happened at that

12

time is they stuck in the words "sexual abuse of a

13

minor."

14

MR. KEDEM:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct.
Okay.

When they stuck in

16

those words in this long list of crimes, some of which

17

have cross references and some of which, like in that

18

very section, murder, rape, deceit, et cetera, do not.

19

At the time they did that, in 1996 -- I think it was

20

'96, or maybe '95 -- there was on the books a Federal

21

statute which had been passed in 1986.

22

statute, by some amazing coincidence, which was a

23

criminal law, is entitled sexual abuse of a minor.

24

then it has a definition.

25

So why not?

And that Federal

And

And think when they use the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

same word to do about the same thing, list a crime, they

2

meant to pick up the same definition, QED.

3

All right?

4

End of case.

Now, why not?
MR. KEDEM:

First of all, if they intended

5

to do so, it would have been very easy to do what

6

they've done in other provisions, which is to include a

7

cross reference.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. KEDEM:

10

Oddly enough --

At least --

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- I can list 10 or 15,

11

including deceit, rape, murder, a whole bunch in this

12

statute --

13

MR. KEDEM:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15
16

Even Petitioner --- which don't use cross

references.
MR. KEDEM:

Even Petitioner does not claim

17

that sexual abuse of a minor is defined entirely by the

18

bounds of the Federal provision.

19

because it would lead to some absurd results.

20

And they couldn't,

For instance, almost all States now, as they

21

did in 1996, have statutes dealing with sexual offenses

22

that are offenses because of a familial relationship, or

23

a relationship of trust or authority, such as

24

student/teacher.

25

by the Federal provision.

None of those offenses are picked up
And so you'd be disqualifying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

those as well.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Kedem, you have here --

3

you have a federal statute.

4

Code, which goes the same way.

5

laws.

6

concede that you can't win unless Chevron applies; is

7

that correct?

You have the Model Penal
You have 30-plus State

So at the least, am I right that -- that you

8

MR. KEDEM:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, certainly not.
You think it's unambiguous,

10

this kind of pragmatic construction about -- what did

11

you say -- like power differentials --

12

MR. KEDEM:

No, no.

I'm sorry.

I didn't

13

mean to suggest that we would win because it's

14

unambiguous that it means only the government's first

15

argument.

16

interpret the words that Congress wrote, the

17

interpretation that we put forward, we think, is a much

18

more meaningful one than the one that Petitioners put

19

forward, to the extent that they even offer any.

20

The point is simply that if you're going to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -- I guess I don't

21

understand that.

22

the clearly better reading to go -- to -- to say

23

notwithstanding the Federal statute, notwithstanding

24

30-plus State statutes, notwithstanding the Model Penal

25

Code, we just know that when somebody talks about sexual

You're saying that it would be the --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

abuse of a minor, they're talking about age 18 with a

2

three-year differential?

3

MR. KEDEM:

So I think I would just step

4

back to say that when this Court is giving content to

5

the Federal provision of the first step of the

6

categorical approach, it is engaging in a normal case of

7

statutory interpretation which brings to bear --

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

MR. KEDEM:

10
11

Well, I'm asking --

-- all of the --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- about normal statutory

interpretation.

12

MR. KEDEM:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The normal -The normal statutory

14

interpretation get you to think that out of, like -- out

15

of our heads pops 18 plus a three-year differential --

16
17
18

MR. KEDEM:

I see.

So now you're asking

about the board's interpretation.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- looking at -- as opposed

19

to looking at 30-plus States, the Model Penal Code, and

20

the Federal statute, which all define it differently.

21

MR. KEDEM:

Sure.

So, first with respect to

22

all the different State laws, even in the two cases

23

under the categorical approach where this Court has

24

looked to multi-jurisdictional surveys, it did not apply

25

Petitioner's methodology.

In other words, it did not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

ask in Taylor whether second-degree burglary under

2

Missouri law would have been criminal under the penal

3

codes of 50 different States.

4

can be relevant only insofar as you think that they will

5

tell you something about the words that Congress used.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I think State surveys

And this quest for the --

7

the generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor seems to

8

me to be a -- a meaningless quest.

9

there.

There's no "there"

It's not like burglary where there's a common

10

law definition.

11

that doesn't have a common law counterpart.

12

look at all these State statutes and throw in all the

13

Federal statutes that you can find that have some

14

relation to this, what you have is a -- a big array of

15

very disparate statutes.

You've got some core.

This is a phrase
And if you

16

So this seems to me like a classic example

17

of Congress saying, we have this category sexual abuse

18

of a minor, and we know that there's all this array of

19

State laws.

20

should be within this for immigration purposes.

21

And so you, Attorney General, define what

MR. KEDEM:

We agree with that, Justice

22

Alito.

23

deference in general, I'd like to just identify --

Before we turn to issues of Chevron and

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

MR. KEDEM:

Mr. Kedem, can I say that --

Sure.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- I think you disagree with

2

two parts of that.

3

me was that you agree that the first thing that has to

4

be done is to define a generic offense.

Because the first thing you said to

5

MR. KEDEM:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's correct.
So Justice Alito was

7

suggesting that, in this case, we shouldn't do that at

8

all.

9

said, in this case you just have to think like, what

10

So you disagree there.

And then Justice Alito

does the BIA think about this?

11

MR. KEDEM:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Correct.
But you said to me, even

13

without deference, you win.

14

very different view than Justice Alito is.

15

saying that what the BIA interpretation was is the best

16

understanding of the generic offense.

17

MR. KEDEM:

So -- so you're taking a
You're

So maybe the best way to answer

18

that question is to describe what the government thinks

19

is the relationship between the two arguments that we

20

make in the brief.

21

The term "sexual abuse of a minor" would

22

naturally support the interpretation that we offer in

23

the first section of our brief to cover all sexual

24

activity directed at a minor under the age of 18 years

However, the board has chosen a more modest

interpretation based on a practical construction of the

2

word "abuse."

3

Attorney General's authority to interpret and give

4

meaning to the statute, because it chose a definition

5

that is both reasonable and consistent with the statute,

6

this Court should defer because that is what Congress

wanted.

8

And because the board exercises the

14

MR. KEDEM:

But because -What about

So I think application of the

15

rule of lenity does coexist with Chevron in the

16

following sense:

17

board, the board has recognized that lenity can come

18

into play, but it has conceived of it in the same

19

limited way that this Court has; namely, that you don't

20

apply lenity simply because the statute can be read in

21

more than one way.

22

everything else, you simply have to throw up your hands

23

because you cannot figure out what Congress wanted.

24

There is a grievous ambiguity that simply cannot be

25

resolved.

I think, first of all, before the

You apply it only when, after trying

Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you necessarily

apply Chevron before you apply the rule of lenity?

3

MR. KEDEM:

I think -- I think that you do,

4

but I think there's still work for lenity to do even

5

after applying Chevron.

6

spoken to the precise question at issue, then I think it

7

would be hard for you to be left at the end of the day

8

after giving that deference where it's a grievous

9

ambiguity.

Certainly, if the board has

But often agencies speak only to a related

10

question or fill only part of a statutory gap, in which

11

case after giving appropriate deference to that answer,

12

you would still possibly be left with a different aspect

13

of the problem that you simply cannot resolve, in which

14

case lenity would apply.

15

But we don't think it makes sense to apply

16

lenity at the first step of the -- at the first step of

17

Chevron, because at that step, the Court is asking, are

18

the words sufficiently clear that there's really only

19

one way to read them?

20

apply a tie-breaking canon that says you only come into

21

play at the end of the process after you simply cannot

22

figure out what the words mean at all.

23

this Court has never applied lenity in that way --

24
25

And it doesn't make sense to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And certainly,

I can understand Chevron

in the context of an agency that has special expertise

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

in regulating the environment or the forest service or

2

fisheries or nuclear power.

3

expertise in determining the meaning of a criminal

4

statute?

5

MR. KEDEM:

Why does the INS have any

So, first of all, Justice

6

Kennedy, I think it's important to orient ourselves

7

around the fact that this is a civil statute that's

8

being applied in a civil context.

9

your point that it's not as if the agency can read a

10

dictionary or look at legislative history any better

11

than any -- any courts certainly.

12

agencies generally.

13

But I do agree with

And that's true of

But when the agencies give meaning to a

14

statute, they bring to bear practical wisdom and

15

experience in ways that are important.

16

instance, in this case, the Board of Immigration

17

Appeals, first of all, decided that because there are so

18

many -- so much variation among the different State

19

offenses that are involved here, it made sense to apply

20

an incremental approach to engage in case-by-case

21

adjudication rather than trying to cover the waterfront.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And, for

But why is INS in any

23

better position to make that determination than the

24

American Bar Association or the forest service?

25

MR. KEDEM:

So I think that the board

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

exercises delegated authority from the Attorney General,

2

who is administering the scheme in an administrative

3

capacity.

4

Chevron deference, while accurate, is actually a little

5

bit misleading.

6

Chevron, we're talking about the concept that when

7

Congress gives an agency the power to engage in

8

rulemaking or formal adjudication, we basically assume

9

that that power comes along with the ability to

10

And I think to a certain extent talking about

Because often when we're talking about

interpret the statute.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

What he's saying -- I think

12

what the question is, is this:

13

agencies -- Social Security -- that have statutes that

14

are incredibly detailed and have to do rather directly

15

with how this program is being administered.

16

MR. KEDEM:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

There are many

Sure.
And they see some words

18

over here in Part 1 on page 3860.

19

wouldn't know, that if you interpret it one way rather

20

than another, it's going to be much harder to do the

21

thing as a practical matter that they have over there on

22

page 842.

All right?

They'll know that; we won't know.

23

MR. KEDEM:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

And they know, but we

Sure.
But you've just listed

things that we seem to be able to know just as well as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1
2

they.
MR. KEDEM:

So, Justice Breyer, one thing to

3

keep in mind is that the aggravated felony definition is

4

a spine that runs throughout the INA and determines a

5

whole range of administrative consequences, not merely

6

whether a person is removable, but whether they're

7

eligible, for instance, for cancelation of removal --

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. KEDEM:

10
11

Yeah.

-- asylum, certain detention

consequences, voluntary departure, readmission.
And in this case we're dealing with a

12

delegation of interpretive authority that is not merely

13

implicit in the sort of general sense Chevron talks

14

about it, but an express provision 8 U.S.C. 1103(a),

15

which says that the Attorney General not only gets to

16

conduct removal proceedings, but gets to render

17

interpretations in those proceedings that are, quote,

18

"controlling."

19

Aguirre-Aguirre and Negusie on that fact.

20

And this Court has relied in cases like

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So was there

21

anything else?

22

first question, which you probably don't remember now.

23

But -- but I wanted to know why don't just look at 1143,

24

25

Because what I asked -- I wanted my

MR. KEDEM:

19

Certainly, all of the States that set a higher

If I could return just briefly to basically

20

the questions I've gotten about whether this statute

21

seems to be a bit of an outlier and why not just rule

22

out this statute.

23

serious problems with that.

24
25

I think there are a few really

The first is that it would leave very patchy
and meager coverage because most State statutes are not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

continuous.

2

for 13-year-old minors, a different one for 14-year-old

3

minors, and so on and so forth.

4

into age ranges.

5

Arizona has one provision that covers minors' ages 15

6

and up; a different provision that covers minors 14 and

7

below.

8

provision is disqualified because it applies to 16 and

9

17-year-olds or because it has a 2-year age

Meaning that they don't have one provision

They tend to clump them

And Arizona is a good example of this.

If this Court were to say that the 15 and up

10

differential, that would leave only the 14 and below

11

provision, which means that a 15-year-old minor would

12

get no coverage regardless of the age of the

13

perpetrator.

14

statutes that are just like that; Virginia, North

15

Dakota.

And it's not alone.

There are other State

16

Second of all, it's actually quite --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

Well, that's a good

reason to look at to 2243.

19

MR. KEDEM:

Well, 2243 would disqualify even

20

more because, again, it requires a 16-year-old age of

21

consent, a 4-year age differential, and it includes a

22

reasonable mistake of age defense that most States don't

23

have.

24
25

I think it's also actually quite difficult
to determine what is or isn't an outlier.

Alderson Reporting Company

First of all,

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

because State statutes differ on a range of different

2

categories simultaneously.

3

them; the age of the victim, the perpetrator, the age

4

differential, and the offense conduct.

5

there's a mens rea requirement that some States have and

6

other States don't.

7

gratification that other States do not.

8
9

We've focused on four of

But, again,

Some require an element of sexual

Moreover, it's difficult enough when you're
talking about current State statutes.

You have to go to

10

all of the criminal -- go through all of the criminal

11

code of Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, and so on and so

12

forth, and that's difficult because States don't label

13

these crimes the same way.

14

all States currently put those online.

15

But it's possible because

But as Petitioner has conceded, we're

16

talking about State codes as they existed in 1996, which

17

means to do that, you really have to go to the statute

18

books.

19

how this is the required methodology, hasn't even

20

performed that task for the statutes as they existed in

21

1996.

22

And Petitioner himself, for all his talk about

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

about your interpretation.

24

"abusive" to mean illegal.

25

MR. KEDEM:

There's one question

You interpret the word

That -- that is under the first

2

3

its own definition under the dictionary and its own

4

understood meaning.

5
6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's -- it's -- the

And -- and you -- but you

say that sexual abuse means illegal sexual contact.

7

MR. KEDEM:

Illegal sexual conduct, usually,

8

and the word "minor" added to the statutory provision,

9

sort of reinforces that we're just talking about minors

10

here.

11

So, in addition to the problems that I've

12

just been discussing with this multi-jurisdictional

13

survey and looking for outliers, it would also pull the

problems.

schemes that impose criminal consequences on decisions

that are made by administrative agencies.

15

be that there are concerns under that about notice or

concerns about delegation concerns, but Petitioner

himself obviously has no notice problems here given that

18

we're talking about a core administration in the civil

scheme, and that any criminal conduct that he might

20

engage in in the future, he would have very clear notice

21

that his prior State offense was an aggravated felony.

22

Now, it may

Perhaps there would be someone in some

23

hypothetical case who engaged in the offense conduct

24

before the board rendered its authoritative

interpretation, and maybe they would have an as-applied

2

aware of notice concerns ever coming into play.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Don't you have the

4

problem that somebody in another State that did the same

5

thing that this defendant was -- this person was

6

convicted of would be no crime in another State?

7

MR. KEDEM:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

MR. KEDEM:

Sure.
So --

That -- that's true whenever you

10

have the categorical approach.

11

Kawashima, this Court dealt with a provision covering

12

offenses involving fraud or deceit.

13

there are certain of those offenses that apply to -- in

14

one State that don't apply in another State, and that's

15

just a feature of the categorical approach.

So, for instance, in

It may be that

16

I also think there are a number of features

17

of this case that distinguish it from maybe some of the

18

more problematic criminal applications that the Court

19

might have in mind.

20

First of all, we're talking about a core INA

21

provision.

22

and which is the dog, in this case, the civil

23

application is very much the dog.

24

thousands of times a year.

25

in the criminal context is vanishingly small.

So if you're talking about which is the tail

It is applied civilly

The number of applications

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

Second of all -- second of all, we're

2

talking here about an explicit delegation of

3

interpretive authority, which is actually quite rare.

4

It is rare that Congress says that an agency explicitly

5

gets to render controlling interpretations of the

6

statute.

7

Furthermore, we're talking about only

8

instances of further culpable conduct.

9

violation of the board's decision alone that gets you

It is not a

10

into criminal trouble.

11

conduct, and that conduct has its own culpability.

12

You have to engage in further

And, finally, all of the potential criminal

13

consequences that we're talking about, these three

14

statutes, are ones that come for people who are trying

15

to violate and frustrate the civil scheme.

16
17

So Section 1253 talks about people who are
ordered to be removed but refuse to comply.

18

Section 1326 talks about people who have

19

been removed but then try illegally to reenter the

20

country.

21
22
23

And 1327 applies to people who try and
illegally assist others who are entering the country.
And so they are all directed at frustration

24

of the core civil scheme.

25

to distinguish this case from other, more problematic

So that would be another way

instances.

2

Finally, I think part of what the Court is

3

reacting to, again, is the idea that drawing a line is

4

very difficult, and it's something that will be a little

5

bit arbitrary no matter what.

6

reason to defer to the board, because administrative

7

agencies are actually quite good at drawing these sorts

8

of lines.

9

for courts to do it.

10

I think that's a strong

And conversely, they're sort of problematic

And there's a layer of political

11

accountability that comes along when an agency does it,

12

because if the agency puts the -- the line in the wrong

place, if they make it too strenuous or too lenient,

14

then they can be held accountable for that.

25

Four topics.

the cases the government talks about where the Court has

Alderson Reporting Company

not conducted those kinds of surveys are cases where the

2

Court did not have to define a generic offense.

3

cases that the Court has had to do that are Taylor and

4

in Duenas-Alvarez.

5

this Court looked to multi-jurisdictional surveys.

6

The two

And in both cases, they looked to --

And it's especially surprising to see the

7

government here criticizing multi-jurisdictional surveys

8

because that's precisely the approach the government

asked this Court to adopt in Duenas-Alvarez.

10

And the

Court did, unanimously.

11

If I -- if I could just read one sentence of

12

that opinion, because it's not just a

13

multi-jurisdictional analysis, but it's conducting it in

14

the precise manner we asked the Court to conduct it

15

here.

16

The Court says at page 191, "To succeed,

17

Deunas-Alvarez must show something special about

19

statute -- "that criminalizes conduct that other States

20

would not consider illegal."

21

That's the question the Court posed at the

22

government's behest and answered in Duenas-Alvarez, and

23

that's the question we ask the Court to ask and answer

24

here today.

25

And for good reason.
You don't just -- you need to have something

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

55
1

that's replicable and something that's objective when

2

you confront a provision that doesn't have an express

3

definition.

4

Imagine the person in his lawyer's office

5

saying, should I plead guilty to this crime or the other

6

crime?

7

can't imagine a defendant's lawyer conducting his

8

Padilla duties, and having to imagine what the BIA might

9

come up with when it surveys family planning journals

Which one is going to render me deportable?

You

10

from 20 years ago and imagines the kinds of things the

11

Solicitor General was describing.

12

instrumental reasons for using multi-jurisdictional

13

surveys.

14

And so there are good

Finally, if you did end up in a situation

15

the Solicitor General would like you to believe exists

16

here, but we think doesn't, but if there were a

17

situation where you just had a scatter plot among the

18

States, and it were too difficult to find any common

19

core, what you would do in that situation is what the

20

Ninth Circuit, in a leading opinion by Judge Kozinski

21

did in a case called Anderson, which is revert back to

22

the Federal statute, defining that Federal offense, the

23

crime itself, where Congress acted like a criminal law

24

maker and said, here's what we want to cover.

25

Second, as to the topic of ruling out some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

56
1

State statutes, depending on what rule the Court would

2

adopt here.

3

our reply brief, that you actually don't have a serious

4

problem with overinclusiveness, because, yes, there are

5

some particular State laws that are going to get

6

rendered not aggravated felonies.

7

have laws dealing with 16 year olds, or -- or 15 year

8

old ages of consent, or slightly younger.

9

still going to get the people that Congress most wanted

10

We say, for the reasons in Footnote 1 of

All of those States

So you're

the law to apply to.

11

And just take an example like Georgia.

It

12

has a law making it a crime for anyone to have sex with

13

somebody who's under 16, with no age differential at

14

all.

15

in Section 2243, it still wouldn't be a problem in that

16

state because Georgia has a second law making it a

17

felony as opposed to a misdemeanor when there's a

18

four-year age differential.

19

again in the State laws that you don't have a serious

20

problem with consequences.

21

Even if you wanted to pick up the age differential

So you find this time and

Next, the Solicitor General talked about

22

Section 2243 if you were to adopt that definition, in

23

leaving out things like familial abuse or abuse of

24

authority and the like.

25

Now we agree, or at least our position is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

that you don't have to answer that question.

2

in all candor, that is the hard case.

3

falls outside of Section 2243, and the reason why you

4

don't necessarily have to choose in this case.

5

I think,

It's the one that

But there would be a good reason to choose

6

Section 2243, is because the structure of the BIA -- I'm

7

sorry -- the structure of the INA has other provisions

8

that make other things deportable offenses, most notably

9

child abuse or crimes against moral turpitude.

So the

10

familial abuse, like my friend here is describing, would

11

be picked up in a separate subsection of the INA.

12

you don't have to worry about that consequence either.

13

So

And then finally, as to statutory

14

construction and the rule of lenity.

15

don't have to reach that difficult question about how

16

Chevron and the rule of lenity interact when it comes to

17

hybrid statutes.

18

side's argument, all it's down to is a Black's Law

19

Dictionary citation, primarily.

20

has its problems for the reason Justice Alito pointed

21

out, when it deals with people who are not

22

acquaintances.

23

First, I'd say you

I think, if I understood the other

And -- and even that

And secondly, because even that provision

24

itself uses the word "illegal."

25

"illegal" have meaning, as Justice Kagan points out you

And to make the word

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

58
1

need to do, you turn to a different page in Black's Law

2

Dictionary to find out when sex is illegal based on age,

3

and it tells you that 16 is the age of consent.

4

Black's Law Dictionary leads to where we would have the

5

Court go, so the BIA's interpretation cannot possibly be

6

reasonable.

7

So even

But if you did want to address or need to

8

address the question of how Chevron and the rule of

9

lenity interact, at the end of the day, the Solicitor

10

General has to be arguing one of two things to this

11

Court.

12

Either their position has to be that

13

statutes can be chameleons and mean one thing on

14

criminal side and a different thing in the civil side --

15

and that would be in the teeth of many of this Court's

16

cases -- or they have to be arguing that the BIA has the

17

power to -- to control -- I'm sorry -- to control what a

18

statute means, not just in civil settings, but in

19

criminal settings.

20

departure from anything the Court has ever held, at

21

least where Congress hasn't delegated that power

22

expressly to the agency to control, not only civil

23

applications, but also the scope of criminal law.

24
25

And that would be a dramatic

If there's a problem with that, if you're
troubled by that consequence, remember, Congress can

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

always draft two separate statutes.

2

day, it's Congress's choice whether to have a statute

3

apply in both settings.

4

conclude that if Congress has a statute applying in both

5

settings, it wants it, first of all, to mean the same

6

thing, and second of all, it doesn't intend the agency

7

to have power over that particular provision.

8
9
10
11
12
13
14

At the end of the

And I think it's reasonable to

If the Court has any questions about our
approach or about what I've said, I'm happy to answer
them, otherwise I'll submit the case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.
