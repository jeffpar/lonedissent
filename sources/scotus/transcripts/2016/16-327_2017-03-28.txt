CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

this morning in case 16-327, Lee v. United States.
Mr. Bursch.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Jae Lee accepted a plea based on his

11

counsel's assurance he would not be deported.

12

had it exactly backward.

13

banishment from the United States.

Counsel

The plea resulted in mandatory

14

No one seriously doubts that if Mr. Lee knew

15

the truth about his plea, he would have rejected it, had

16

the Sixth Circuit dispensed with this Court's totality

17

of the circumstances test for proving prejudice and

18

created a categorical rule.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In -- in State courts, do

20

State -- are State courts mandated to follow what we do

21

in the Federal courts under Rule 11; that is to say,

22

before the guilty plea is accepted, to advise the

23

defendant of all of his rights?

24
25

MR. BURSCH:

Yeah.

I'm sure they are.
I think in most State

courts they do follow that procedure.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do -- do they also tell --

2

advise the defendant that if he or she is an alien,

3

there may be certain consequences to the plea?

4

courts, do you happen to know?

5

MR. BURSCH:

In State

I mean, in State courts, every

6

court would have their own version of Rule 11, and so

7

they're going to have some colloquy, and -- and I

8

believe those colloquies have changed somewhat since

9

Padilla.

10

I -- you know, and so one of the problems

11

here, if you look at what happened during the -- the

12

withdrawal of the plea, everyone in the court, including

13

the judge, thought that Mr. Lee was going to remain in

14

the United States after he served his sentence.

15
16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
that in -- in --

17
18

MR. BURSCH:

Let -- let me walk you through

that.

19
20

But I -- I don't quite see

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- at -- at 103 of -- of

the Joint Appendix, which is the beginning --

21

MR. BURSCH:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
The judge, after advising

23

him of many of his rights, says:

24

citizen?

25

Are you a U.S.

No, your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Okay.

A conviction on this charge then

2

could result in your being deported.

3

affect your decision about whether you want to plead

4

guilty or not?

Does that at all

5

Yes, your Honor.

6

Okay.

7

I don't understand.

8

And then -- and then he talks about it

9
10

How does it affect your decision?

again.
MR. BURSCH:

Right.

And -- and then we find

11

out later, at the 2255 evidentiary hearing,

12

Justice Kennedy, that when he said I don't understand,

13

he then turned to his attorney, Mr. Fitzgerald, and

14

Mr. Fitzgerald said:

15

warning that everybody gets.

16

consequences are not in the plea agreement itself --

Don't worry.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. BURSCH:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is a standard

If the deportation

Well, except --

-- you will not be deported.
-- I'm -- I'm not sure how

20

much more the judge can do, and that at least argues for

21

our accepting midway ground of requiring Strickland

22

conspiracy -- Strickland -- Strickland doubt,

23

reasonable -- reasonable probability of -- of success if

24

you go to a jury.

25

MR. BURSCH:

Well -- well, two -- two points

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

on that, Justice Kennedy.

2

First, with respect to what he heard from

3

the judges, what I would really like the Court to focus

4

on is the sentencing hearing colloquy, which is at pages

5

124 to 127 of the Joint Appendix.

6

that everyone, even the Federal District Court judge,

7

believed that he was going to be released back into the

8

United States after his one year was over.

9

him on three years of supervised release and told him to

And there, it's clear

She even put

10

give the probation officer his address once he was

11

released.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. BURSCH:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- and that --

15

deficient performance.

16

the question is -- is prejudice.

17

MR. BURSCH:

Well, that's --

That goes to

I think we're beyond that, and

Well, but -- but the question

18

there, at the colloquy, was whether he was informed at

19

all and how that prejudice -- to kind of combine the

20

response to yours and Justice Kennedy's question, what's

21

the standard that we have here?

22

And we -- we start with the baseline, which

23

is Strickland, is there a reasonable probability of a

24

different outcome, but that was refined by this Court in

25

Hill.

And as we explain at length in the reply brief,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

the Hill test is whether there a reasonable probability

2

the defendant would not have pleaded guilty.

3

here --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

But is that -On that point, you

6

say the facts here support that -- that conclusion and

7

go through them all, but I don't understand how you'll

8

be able to distinguish any case in the future.

9

You say:

Well, here, he's been here a long

10

time, hasn't gone back to South Korea, has he started --

11

but I think someone who's just arrived might say:

12

know, this has been my passion my whole life to come to

13

the United States; I don't want to go back.

14

You know, it -- it -- I'm not sure how, at

15

the outset, a judge can simply say:

16

to have a hearing in a case like this.

17

You

Oh, we don't need

It seems to me that there would necessarily

18

have to be a hearing in every case.

19

MR. BURSCH:

Well, there would at least have

20

to be a 2255 hearing to get those facts on the table.

21

But, Mr. Chief justice, what I want to emphasize is that

22

this is an objective test, not a subjective test.

And

23

so it's not enough for a defendant simply to say:

Well,

24

had I known, I would have rejected my plea.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, it sounds like

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

a subjective test.

2

hypothetically, or we can assume it's actually, the idea

3

is that, even though the result of a trial is going to

4

be exactly the same, there's no reasonable probability

5

that he won't be deported, he nonetheless wants to go

6

through the trial.

7

I mean -- I don't know if it's

Now that could be certainly characterized as

8

a subjective wish, not an objective.

9

person would say:

10
11

An objective

Well, it's going to come out the same

anyway.
MR. BURSCH:

Well -- well, first, let's talk

12

about an example where you can see where the outcome

13

would be different based on objective, and then let's go

14

back to the facts of this case and show why it's

15

objectively rational here.

16

I -- consider a case where a defendant is

17

new to the country.

18

to the United States; they're all to his country of

19

origin, and the sentencing disparity between the plea

20

that was offered and what could happen to him if he went

21

to trial is enormous.

22

be rational for that person to choose to go to trial,

23

because they don't have the connections.

He has no familial or business ties

Say it's 50 years.

It would not

24

But what we're talking about here --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What does rationality

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

have to do with this, Mr. Bursch?

2

MR. BURSCH:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -We often get people who

4

come in and say I wasn't told about a plea, and I would

5

have pled guilty.

6

find out that the defendant was claiming he was

7

innocent, despite overwhelming evidence that he or she

8

was guilty.

9
10

And judges then look at the facts and

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Rock solid evidence.

I

11

mean, not only is there a video, there's witnesses,

12

there's fingerprints, you name it, they're there, and

13

defendants will come in and say I'm not guilty.

14

say, you know, he's foolish, he's irrational.

15

rational human being would not take this plea, the

16

difference between 50 years and five years, and yet, we

17

deny their motion to undo their plea because we

18

basically say it's subjective.

19

wanted to go to trial.

20

And we
No

This foolish defendant

I'm not quite sure what objectivity has to

21

do with making a judgment whether this particular

22

person, under their particular circumstances, would have

23

or would not have gone to trial.

24
25

Now, the factors you point to can support
that subjective wish.

If the difference between going

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

to jail or not is only nine months, I might say:

Hmm,

2

hundred percent chance I'm going to be deported.

And

3

the only benefit I get is nine months in my plea, which

4

is what happened here.

5

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And there's even a one

7

percent chance that I might be found not guilty, or at

8

least found guilty of possession and not something else.

9

I think I'm going to roll the dice.

10
11

MR. BURSCH:

Exactly.

here --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. BURSCH:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

And that's why,

It's not irrational.

It -- it -But I don't know whether

--

16

MR. BURSCH:

It's irrational, and it's

17

reasonably probable that that's the decision he would

18

have made if properly informed.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I --

I don't think that's --

20

Mr. Bursch, I don't think that's a manageable standard.

21

I -- I see a number of possible standards that could be

22

used here.

23

defendant have done?

24

creates a lot of practical difficulties.

25

One is purely subjective:

What would this

I understand the concept; it

Another objective standard would be, is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

there a reasonable probability of a better outcome if

2

the defendant had gone to trial?

3

That's standard Strickland.

4

That's manageable.

But if the test is, would a rational

5

defendant have in -- have gone to trial given the -- the

6

sentence that would be -- that the defendant might face

7

if convicted discounted by the probability of conviction

8

versus the consequences of -- of deportation, I -- I

9

don't know how to do that.

It's -- it's -- because

10

it -- it depends on how a particular person values those

11

two things.

12

MR. BURSCH:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well -Isn't it -- is it irrational

14

to try to climb Mount Everest without oxygen?

15

is it irrational to swim with sharks or perform on a

16

tightrope without a net?

17

things, but people do it.

18

irrational.

19

value things differently.

I mean, I wouldn't do those
I can't say they're

They're much less risk averse and they
I -- I think --

20

MR. BURSCH:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22
23

I mean,

Right.
-- it's an unmanageable

standard.
MR. BURSCH:

Well, I -- I think that the

24

rationality standard, which you articulated in Padilla

25

but not Hill, is supposed to be a low standard.

Alderson Reporting Company

It's a

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

backstop to prevent the person from making the crazy

2

decision like Justice Sotomayor was suggesting, where if

3

the consequences of going to trial were the death

4

penalty and they had a plea on the table where they

5

could serve 12 months and then -- then be out, you know,

6

true irrationality.

7

you're going to be dealing with a defendant who acts

8

rational, and -- and it's simply a backstop.

9

In most cases, like this one,

And when you're talking about giving up any

10

chance to stay in this country versus a 9- to 11-month

11

diminution in the sentencing guidelines range, I -- I

12

think that's not only rational for Mr. Lee or for you

13

and me, but for almost anyone.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I -- you have very

15

sympathetic facts, but suppose we change the variables a

16

bit.

17

scale.

You know, they both can -- they both are a sliding

18

MR. BURSCH:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
So you have a much more

20

serious -- the potential for a much more serious

21

sentence.

22

person will serve eight years.

23

who has many more ties to the country to which the

24

person would be removed.

25

Let's say, if the person is convicted, the
And you have a person

Now, how do you make that -- how do you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

decide whether that's rational?

2

MR. BURSCH:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

Well -At what point does it become

irrational?

5

MR. BURSCH:

6

point is the Hill test:

7

probability the defendant, given all the objective

8

circumstances, would have pleaded guilty?

9

you've satisfied that, then you say, well, was this a

Well, I think the starting
Is there a reasonable

And once

10

rational thing to do?

11

close cases.

12

sentence versus a 12-month sentence defendant from doing

13

something irrational.

14

easy.

15

And the Court shouldn't guess in

Again, it's a backstop to prevent the life

In a case like this one, it's

But courts have to do this balancing all the

16

time.

17

take any of those factors and say we're not going to

18

consider those, which is what the Sixth Circuit did.

19

said, you're going to look at all the circumstances.

20

And so in your hypothetical, the length of the sentence

21

matters and the consequences matter.

And the genius of Strickland was that we didn't

22

Now, I want to take your --

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

Mr. -- is unlike Strickland in this sense?

25

Strickland, so it's a trial error and the Court can --

We

Isn't this case, Mr. --

Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

can determine whether it's harmless.

2

MR. BURSCH:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
But here, the plea is --

4

is a different thing.

5

error.

6

informed, I would exercise my constitutional right to a

7

jury trial.

8

say I have to be rational in making that choice.

9

a right to a jury trial.

10

The plea -- there is no trial

And the defendant says, if I were properly

And it doesn't -- the Constitution doesn't

MR. BURSCH:

Yeah.

I have

We agree with that,

11

because what -- what Hill made clear is that the trial

12

process and the plea process are two different things.

13

And I'll quote from Hill.

14

Whether ineffective performance affected the outcome of

15

the plea process.

16

Justice Ginsburg, causes a defendant to forsake their

17

constitutional right to choose a trial.

18

This is 474 U.S. at 59.

Misadvice, as you're indicating,

So it's a prejudice to the decision, Justice

19

Alito, whether to invoke their right to trial in the

20

first instance.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

But that points to a purely

22

subjective test, which, as I said, is conceptually

23

coherent, but creates a lot of practical difficulties,

24

because then the Court is going to have to try to

25

recreate what the defendant would have done.

Alderson Reporting Company

And, of

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

course, after the defendant has been in prison for a

2

while and is facing deportation, the person -- the

3

person, I mean, I don't know, may have second thoughts.

4

It's very hard to recreate that.

5

MR. BURSCH:

Well, it's not so hard, because

6

under the Federal statute for filing a 2255 petition,

7

you've got to do it within a year.

8

happened here is Mr. Lee found out, essentially the day

9

that he was assigned to a facility, that it was a

10

You know, what

detention facility.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

But is that what you're

12

asking us to do, to adopt a purely subjective standard?

13

You say no.

14

MR. BURSCH:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. BURSCH:

No, absolutely not.
What is -What is -What is your standard?

Our standard is the same

19

objective standard you articulated in Hill, and that is

20

whether there was a reasonable probability the defendant

21

would not have pleaded guilty.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So -- so wait.

You -- even if it's irrational?
MR. BURSCH:

Well, we're -- we're -- we're

willing to live with the Padilla language that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

decision --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. BURSCH:

4

Well --

-- can be completely

irrational.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- it's the same question

6

differently, but it's meant to be the same question.

7

What is the precise mistake of law that you think that

8

the Sixth -- that the Sixth Circuit -- that Judge

9

Batchelder made?

10

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

Judge Batchelder in the

11

Sixth Circuit made the mistake of having a categorical

12

test, where instead of considering all the circumstances

13

objectively, she looked only at the likelihood of

14

success at trial to the exclusion of everything else.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I'm not sure she did

16

that.

17

she tried to follow what we've said.

18

MR. BURSCH:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought that she said -- my reading of it was

Well, if you look -And -- and in particular --

20

in particular, she said, look, this person would have

21

been faced with a choice.

22

example.

23

25

for a lot more time.

So you started with your

She says, here it's the same.

He would have

2

ended up being deported anyway.

3

had to tell him, your chance of winning this trial is

4

zero, near zero, close to zero, and you'll have served

5

an extra -- at least an extra 9 to 11 months because

6

you'll be in jail for 9 to 11 months more, and the same

7

thing will happen to you anyway.

8

It might be more than 9 to 11 months, because the

9

chances of departure are smaller.

10

Okay.

The lawyer would have

So now I can repeat, and you started

11

in answering the Chief Justice:

12

this case?

13

and there are legal differences.

14

differences -MR. BURSCH:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

What's different about

And I'd say there are factual differences

15

17

Who would want that?

Start with the legal

Well --- and then tell us the

factual differences, why they matter.
MR. BURSCH:

Starting with the -- the legal,

19

on page 4A of the Petition Appendix, that's where Judge

20

Batchelder reaffirms the Sixth Circuit decision in

21

Pilla, P-i-l-l-a, which says:

22

overwhelming evidence of guilt, then it's not rational

23

for them to do anything other than to take the best --

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

If a defendant is facing

I thought she said only if

the only hope for him is jury nullification.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

MR. BURSCH:

Well, she went on about jury

2

nullification, but the test in Pilla that she followed,

3

because it was Sixth Circuit precedent, was you only

4

consider overwhelming evidence --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. BURSCH:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

-- in that -So what we -- what you want

8

us to do is to add to what she said.

9

to mean by that is it would have been no hope for you at

10

trial.

That's the reason.

11

MR. BURSCH:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13
14
15

And what you have

That's not really -No hope for you.

Well,

what do you want us to do?
MR. BURSCH:

That's -- that's not the point

that we're making.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. BURSCH:

What is the --

The point is you should never

18

focus just on one piece of the circumstances, the

19

likelihood of success at trial.

20

the circumstances, like you said in --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. BURSCH:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

You should consider all

Let's consider them all.

And -- and -And suppose one of them is

24

there's no hope of success at trial except jury

25

nullification.

2

MR. BURSCH:

Right.

And -- and there's two

responses to that --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. BURSCH:

Right.

-- which are kind of legal and

5

that's the case --

The first is that even a -- a defendant who

-- may still choose to invoke

10

their right to trial rather than take certain mandatory

11

banishment from the United States for the benefit of

12

only a 9- to 11-month reduction in their sentencing

13

range.

14

That is both reasonable and rational.
The second is that there's a possibility

15

that with informed counsel, he would be able to bargain

16

for a plea that has lesser deportation consequences.

17

And we know that, again, Justice Kennedy, going back to

18

124 to 127 of the Joint Appendix, the sentencing hearing

19

colloquy, even the government thought that this plea was

20

going to result in Mr. Lee going back to his restaurant

11

MR. BURSCH:

My -- my understanding is that

position that because there was no likelihood of success

14

at trial, game over.

15

The Sixth Circuit got it right.

We would love to have that opportunity.

And

16

the fact that we haven't had it is exactly why there's

prejudice in this case.

Well, Justice Kennedy, the --

the reasonable probability and rational bases tests

are -- are not our tests; they're your tests in Hill and

Padilla.

5

without any difficulty --

And lower courts have been applying them

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MR. BURSCH:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

But -- but --

-- for many years.
But -- but as Justice

Ginsburg pointed out, we have in -- in those contexts,

10

we -- we have -- we have a trial, and -- and Padilla --

11

Padilla, I understand is different, but -- but it seems

12

to me that your -- you have so many subjective factors

13

that you endanger the system by having second --

14

second -- second thoughts, people who want the second

15

bite of the apple.

16

MR. BURSCH:

But like in any Strickland

17

case, when you consider all the circumstances, you have

18

individualized facts, not subjective facts, but

19

individualized facts that must then be looked at

20

objectively.

21

And -- and let's think about Hill and what

22

happened there.

conditions, and that was enough for this Court to say

25

there was ineffective assistance, but no prejudice there

In -- in Hill, you had attorney who

because he was unable to show a reasonable probability,

2

that had he known the proper parole conditions he would

3

be facing, that he would have rejected the plea.

4

But we have the exact opposite here.

No one

5

denies that if Mr. Lee understood the mandatory

6

banishment that he was facing, of course he would have

7

rejected the plea and taken his chances at trial, even

8

if they were slim.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No -- but I think

10

several times in your brief and here today, you talk

11

about -- you say well, who knows what will happen at

otherwise, there'd never be prejudice in a Strickland

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now -I would have thought that

3

the -- that -- that the difference is more fundamental,

4

which is that usually in Strickland, we are asking what

5

was going to happen at trial.

6

MR. BURSCH:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
And we don't think, well,

8

there was this 1 percent chance that the witness would

9

drop dead.

We put that to the side.

10

MR. BURSCH:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Correct.
But here, the inquiry is

12

different.

13

The inquiry is the outcome of the plea proceeding.

The inquiry is not the outcome of the trial.

14

MR. BURSCH:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Exactly.
And the plea proceeding

16

might be very affected by somebody saying, you know,

17

given my ties to this country, given my negative ties to

18

any other country, given the fact that this is only a

19

nine-month difference in prison term, I'm going to roll

20

the dice for that 1 percent chance.

21

MR. BURSCH:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Exactly.
And that would be a

completely reasonable thing to do, a thing that many

24

people would do.

do you even measure how rational a potential defense may

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

But -- but --

let's -- the question -- but the question that was --

was -- was put to you with reference to Strickland was

4

in the context of what might happen at a trial with

5

different evidence, with different arguments.

6

how to do that.

We know

Judges know how to do that.

7

You're asking us how -- how to assess the

8

mindset of -- of the defendant when -- when he or she

9

makes the plea.

10

That's very different.

MR. BURSCH:

Well, I -- I wouldn't say,

11

because it's an objective test, not the mindset of the

12

defendant, but the mindset of a defendant in this

13

particular instance --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I understand

15

you -- you call your test an objective test.

16

you --

17

MR. BURSCH:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You --

Yes.
I -- I understand that.

19

But the question is whether or not it isn't so distinct

20

from Strickland as to be unworkable.

21

MR. BURSCH:

I don't think it's so distinct

22

as to be unworkable.

23

Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan have articulated,

it's actually much easier here.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Justice Kagan pointed out

2

that the test that you're asking us to apply is the test

3

that this Court says is applicable at the plea stage.

4

Is there a reasonable probability, but for counsel's

5

error, defendant would not have pleaded guilty, but

6

would have insisted on his right to trial?

7

MR. BURSCH:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9
10

Correct.
That's exactly what we

said the standard is, and I think you're just asking us
to -- to adhere to that standard.

11

MR. BURSCH:

I'm asking you to -- to

12

re-adhere to that standard, but also to reaffirm the

13

Strickland totality of the circumstances --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So -- so is

That's --

And what they said was

the absolute rule of this circuit is --

MR. BURSCH:

-- what led this

district court judge to say I believe this person would

11

have gone to trial, but this rule doesn't permit me to

rule in his favor.

13

MR. BURSCH:

That's exactly right, Justice

Sotomayor.

What happens if there's

overwhelming evidence that this defendant, that the

defendant in the case would have gone to trial if the

plea was entered, but also, virtually no chance of

acquittal had the defendant gone to trial.

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FEIGIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The crux of a Padilla claim is the

11

defendant's contention that if he had constitutionally

12

competent counsel, that counsel could have given him a

13

legitimate chance at avoiding a removal with

14

particular -- avoiding a conviction with particular

15

removal consequences.

16

A defendant can't prevail on that kind of

17

claim if there's nothing constitutionally competent

18

counsel could have done to create that chance.

19

that's the case here where the lower courts found, in

20

the words of the court of appeals, that Petitioner had

21

no bona fide defense, not even a weak one, and stood to

22

gain nothing from going to trial aside from a longer

23

prison sentence, except for the off chance of jury

24

nullification --

there are many possibilities where it would nonetheless

Millington is better than what he's going to get

10

Let's say that there -- he has a serious medical

11

Isn't that rational for him to want to go to

14

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, two points on that, Your

15

Honor.

16

"rational" here, and where it uses it in Padilla as a

17

supplement to the "would the defendant go to trial" test

18

and says that the defendant has to convince the court

19

that it would be rational under the circumstances to

20

reject the plea, the Court is using the term "rational"

21

in its traditional legal sense.

22

rational jury and the result a rational jury would

23

reach, we're thinking of a jury that applies the law to

24

the facts and doesn't think about results like jury

25

nullification or happenstance.

First, when I think the Court is using the term

When we talk about a

As to your particular question about whether

2

it would be rational, I think in a more common sense

way, to want that, that might well be true, Mr. Chief

4

Justice, but that's not the kind of thing that we

5

consider to be prejudice for Sixth Amendment purposes

understand Strickland.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under Strickland, in

8

the typical Strickland case where you're talking about

9

the outcome of a trial, I understand that.

But we're

10

talking about something different here.

11

about reasonable probability that he would or would not

have accepted the -- the plea agreement.

MR. FEIGIN:

We're talking

of this Court ever accepting a claim that the

18

And I don't think that's the kind

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah.

But I mean,

19

you know, that's funny, but the -- the fact is this is a

20

situation where he might well have elected to have more

21

prison time because it would keep him in -- in

22

Tennessee, close to his family, where he would be able

23

to visit his children, where he could even, as I think

someone is entitled to counsel who will keep him

18

to anything the courts recognize under Strickland, but

also contrary to our criminal immigration laws where

reentry.

23

clear that there's nothing in the record to suggest that

24

this particular Petitioner, had he known that removal

25

was inevitable for conviction, would nevertheless have

opted for a conviction that would give him a longer

prison sentence.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, that might --

What we were discussing is the

rest --

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about murder?

Suppose

he thinks he's going to be murdered if he's sent abroad.

8

Same problem.

9

MR. FEIGIN:

10

Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:

But, I mean, I -- the

11

problem is that he -- which you can read Judge

12

Batchelder's opinion.

13

says, that -- that if the evidence is overwhelming,

14

that's the end of the matter, and it wouldn't have been

15

rational to -- to ask for a trial.

16

done is think of situations where it might be.

17

he thinks he's going to be sent back to some country in

18

the world and it's going to end up he's dead, as is his

19

family.

I mean, it could be read, as he

And now all we've
I mean,

He'd rather be in jail.
Now, we're not supposed to take that into

account?

Why not?
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, there's a

23

real disconnect between the claim the Petitioner is

24

bringing and the relief that he's seeking.

25

that he is subject to removal is not because of any

Alderson Reporting Company

The reason

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. FEIGIN:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You see --

-- of dealing drugs --- that's confusing two

7

things.

8

Justice made, is that you keep on saying what's the

9

probability that the jury wouldn't have convicted him,

10

but that's not the question, and we made this clear in

11

Hill and in other cases.

And this goes back to the point that the Chief

12

The question is:

What's the -- what's the

13

-- what's the probability that the relevant proceeding

14

would have been different?

15

proceeding is the plea negotiation and the plea

16

agreement.

17

is did this deficient performance lead to a different

18

decision by this -- by Mr. Lee to go to trial or not, to

19

plea or not.

20

looking at here, according to Hill.

21

And here the relevant

And that's the thing that we're looking at

And that's all we're supposed to be

Now, that has its difficulties, as

22

Justice Alito said.

23

we draw lines?

24

some cases, an uncomfortable inquiry.

25

inquiry we're supposed to be making, isn't it?

What exactly do we look to?

How do

There's no question that this is, in

Alderson Reporting Company

But that's the
And you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

keep flipping it to a different inquiry, which is the

2

inquiry in a trial context, but not in a plea context.

3

MR. FEIGIN:

That's because, Justice Kagan,

4

I -- I don't actually think that's purely the inquiry

5

we're supposed to be making here.

6

any other case in this Court's Strickland line values

7

the right to go to trial --

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. FEIGIN:

I don't think Hill or

I'm sorry --

-- early in the --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry --

This is what -- this is what

12

Hill says, Mr. Feigin.

13

standard:

14

reasonable probability that but for counsel's errors, he

15

would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on

16

going to trial.

17
18

It just says, here's the

The defendant must show that there's a

That's what we're trying to determine,
whether he would have insisted on going to trial.

19

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, let me say a few things

20

about that.

21

right to go to trial through the lens of an attorney,

22

and whether the reasonable attorney, who's just looking

23

at the outcome of the trial, would have advised the

24

defendant to go to trial.

25

First, right after that, Hill looks at the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But also -So to the contrary, when

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

Hill keeps on going, it says, you know, this -- this

2

defendant didn't care about his parole eligibility, so

3

we shouldn't -- we shouldn't look at the fact that

4

the -- the parole eligibility was a bad deal for him

5

because he didn't care.

6
7

So the emphasis clearly in Hill is -- is
what are the things that would have made a difference --

8

MR. FEIGIN:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

MR. FEIGIN:

Well --- in the plea negotiation?

Your Honor, the particular

11

defendant in Hill didn't even get to the objective part

12

of the inquiry we're discussing today because he failed

13

at the outset.

14

subjectively would have selected a trial.

15

There wasn't even an allegation that he

But I also point the Court to Padilla where

16

it lays out the test from Hill and says, moreover, a

17

defendant in these circumstances needs to convince the

18

court that it would be rational under the circumstances

19

to reject the plea.

20
21
22

And finally, another good place to look
would be -JUSTICE KAGAN:

What Padilla is saying,

23

isn't it, Mr. Feigin, is essentially, look, this is not

24

going to be a case where somebody can just get up and

25

say this is what I would have done and the court has to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

accept it.

2

No, Padilla says.

3

accept every claim that a defendant makes.

4

test those claims against a notion of rationality,

5

against a notion of what reasonable people would do.

6

But still, the -- the essence of the inquiry is what

7

would -- what would have happened at the plea

8

negotiation, not what would have happened at the trial.

9

MR. FEIGIN:

The court doesn't have to
A court can

Well, with respect, Justice

10

Kagan, I think, as the discussion when my friend was up

11

here demonstrated, I don't think a court can reasonably

12

do that.

13

be somebody who hasn't been in the United States very

14

long and doesn't have the ties that this defendant has

15

who says, well, all my life I've been waiting to come to

16

the United States, and so it's perfectly rational for me

17

to roll the dice.

18

As the Chief Justice pointed out, there might

The -- the last place I would look -- point

19

you to for the fact that trials are treated as

20

instrumental under Strickland, not as ends in and of

21

themselves, is the Court's most recent Strickland

22

decisions in Cooper and Frye, which look to the outcome

23

of what would have happened in the combined trial/plea

24

process, and in fact, find the defendant's election to

25

go to trial was prejudicial where there was a plea offer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

on the table before he went to trial that would have

2

given him a better overall outcome.

3

I think this makes a great deal of sense,

4

because if you're granting relief to defendants in

5

circumstances where a rational jury would have convicted

6

them had they gone to trial, you're giving them windfall

7

relief that they couldn't reasonably have expected at

8

the time.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's the windfall?

10

You're entitled to a constitutional trial.

But putting

11

that aside, you're not entitled to a plea.

You're not

12

entitled to a lesser sentence.

13

jail if you want to.

14

Dominguez Benitez in a Rule 11 Strickland evaluation?

15

You're entitled to go to

Isn't that what we said in

We said that a court should, quote, "Not

16

second guess a defendant's actual decision if it is

17

reasonably probable he would have gone to trial absent

18

the error, it is no matter that the choice may have been

19

foolish."

20

Now, that's Strickland under Rule 11, and

21

it's the same inquiry.

22

had known this information?

23

decision can be foolish.

24
25

MR. FEIGIN:

Would he have pled guilty if he
And we explicitly said your

Well, Your Honor, while

Dominguez Benitez draws some analogies to Strickland,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43

it's a slightly different test.

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's not an analogy.

It

talks about Strickland in the Rule 11 context.

4

MR. FEIGIN:

I think the Court made clear in

5

Gonzalez-Lopez that the Sixth Amendment right to

6

effective assistance of counsel actually includes the

7

prejudice itself, which isn't true of the Rule 11 right

8

that was issued in Dominguez Benitez.

9

come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and the kind of

Attorney errors

10

error that amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel

11

is one that prejudiced the defense.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you have to --

So here we have a

13

defense attorney who says:

14

told him he wouldn't be deported.

15

the law, I would have told him to go to trial.

I didn't know the law.

16

MR. FEIGIN:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I

And if I had known

Well -So this is both

18

prejudice in the advice and prejudice in the decision to

19

go -- move forward.

20
21

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, I think you have to

also --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MR. FEIGIN:

Or not move forward.

I think you have to also look

24

whether there was prejudice in the outcome.

25

actually think this is clear, if we -- if you'll bear

Alderson Reporting Company

And I

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

with me for a second, if you think about an example that

2

comes straight from Hill.

3

So let's take a defendant where there is

4

overwhelming evidence that he committed, say, a bank

5

robbery:

6

you.

7

attorney didn't adequately investigate.

8

attorney did nothing to investigate.

9

don't you plead guilty.

Forensic evidence, video evidence, what have

And that defendant's complaint is that his

10

And the

He just said, why

And it turns out, had the attorney

11

investigated, he would have come up with 20 character

12

witnesses, all of whom would have testified this is a

13

great guy and he just needed money because one of his

14

children was sick.

15

he has a sick child, would have done anything to avoid

16

prison time.

And let's say the defendant, because

17

Under the analysis that goes from page 59 to

18

page 60 in Hill, that defendant, even if we subjectively

19

believed him that he would have selected trial, is not

20

entitled to Strickland relief if his only chance of

21

prevailing at trial was jury nullification or some off

22

chance of some external circumstance handicapping the

23

government's case.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:
I agree with you.

So step back a second.

And

I can't find total clarity in -- in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45

these decisions.

2

making the separation, as they made, between what you

3

look to, to show prejudice in a plea agreement and at a

4

trial, both Strickland errors, it must be that the

5

constitutional consideration of not really wanting a

6

person to feel he has to give up his right to a jury

7

trial, that influences the standard.

8

influence the standard, I have a harder time deciding

9

the cases.

10
11

And it seemed to me that if we're

So, really, I think what we're deciding here
is to what extent it influences the standard.

12

MR. FEIGIN:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

And if it doesn't

Well, Your Honor -And -- and -- and you --

you see how I'm thinking that?

15

MR. FEIGIN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -Because there's a kind of

So we say, well, we'll look just at

But if it's just overwhelming, then we're
Okay.

22

If I'm right as to what these cases mean,

23

then we are in a world where 95 percent of the people

24

and what happens to them depend upon pleas, not upon

25

trials.

And doesn't that argue for "look to that plea"

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46

part of the thing?

2

he'd been convicted at trial.

3

talking about very small degrees here.

4

seems to me to -- to push in the direction of, if you

5

really think he would have gone to trial, that should be

6

the end of it, even if he's pretty irrational.

7

Don't worry so much about whether

MR. FEIGIN:

In other words, we're
But that factor

Your Honor, I don't think

8

that's a good reason for under -- for unwinding reliable

9

admissions of guilt when we have a kind of outlier case

10

like this one where the lower courts were certain that

he would have been convicted at trial unless jury

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

But isn't it sometimes a prosecutor might say, I have a

2

solid case, the evidence is overwhelming, but this is a

3

nice young man and the jury might be sympathetic, so

4

rather than risk nullification, if you call it that, why

5

not give the jury an opportunity to convict him on the

6

lesser, so at least there will be a conviction?

7

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, there might

8

be cases where a prosecutor might say that, but the

9

question here is whether Petitioner has a constitutional

10

entitlement through the lens of ineffective assistance

11

of counsel to try to seek that kind of result.

12

here, there is absolutely no evidence that the trial

there's no constitutional right to go to trial when

there's no evidence?

why.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

MR. FEIGIN:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

Well, let me just --

-- finish the question.

I mean, you would agree that there's a

constitutional right to go to trial, regardless of what

I think I'd have to, Justice

17

20

isn't this correct?

21

-- regardless of what the

entitlement has been taken away by the supremely

And a person's entitlement to go

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50

deficient performance.

2

MR. FEIGIN:

And that should be the question.
So, Your Honor, I think there's

3

several reasons why we would -- we value the right to go

4

to trial ex ante and not necessarily in the Strickland

5

context, whereas I've suggested I think it's much more

6

outcome-focused.

7

The first is that the touchstone of

8

Strickland is fundamental fairness.

9

think both Strickland and Hill exclude the possibility

And we don't -- I

10

of jury nullification or happenstance precisely because

11

we don't think anything unfair has happened to a

12

defendant because he's been denied the possibility --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

different case in that -- in that way.

15

Strickland says is once you're at a trial, you're right

16

17

nothing to do with a fair and accurate trial.

18

Strickland is a very

Because what

lawyer be able to give you, in a nondeficient way, the

22

various circumstances, the various things that you would

23

consider to enable you to make that constitutional --

24

constitutionally protected decision in a reasonable way.

25

And there, what you're entitled to is that a

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, we protect

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

the right to go to trial ex ante very closely and allow

2

a defendant to select that result, even when it's

3

foolish.

4

ex post is that you're asking a judge to both evaluate

5

and endorse the idea that someone would seek these

6

extra-legal results, like jury nullification or simply

7

hoping that overwhelming evidence of guilt falls apart,

8

as a reason for unwinding a reliable admission of

9

guilt --

10

But the difference when you're looking at it

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, all you're asking the

11

judge to do is to say that in certain circumstances, it

12

is not beyond the bounds of reasonableness to throw the

13

dice in order to get an outcome -- in order to get -- in

14

order not to be deported from a country where you've

15

lived your whole life.

16

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

18

particularly workable standard.

like this, it's just going to lead these --

to trial and the trial judge finds it credible, which I

even though that defendant, when he actually faced the

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. FEIGIN:

In this case or in any case.

I think you could ask judges to

3

make those sorts of -- of factual findings.

4

one problem that Justice Kennedy brought up earlier is

5

there's a problem there of hindsight bias, and in some

6

cases, I'm not suggesting that that's true in this case,

7

a defendant telling things that aren't true in order to

8

obtain collateral relief and having an objective

backstop where we make sure that we don't give

But I think

10

defendants a chance in postconviction review that they

11

didn't originally have.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Feigin --

13

Mr. Feigin, routinely papers come in from a Petitioner

14

who says, my lawyer didn't do X.

15

lawyer comes in and says I did do X.

16

the district court says the lawyer told me I did X, and

17

at the pea -- plea colloquy I asked that question and

18

the defendant said yes, I understood that consequence,

19

and the court doesn't have a hearing.

20
21

Most commonly, the
And most commonly,

A ruling in our case wouldn't change those
cases.

22

MR. FEIGIN:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -It wouldn't change the

24

cases where the defendant comes in and says I would have

25

pled guilty, but the lawyer comes in and says he

Alderson Reporting Company

insisted he was innocent.

2

evidence was overwhelming, that he should take the plea,

3

but he kept telling me I'm innocent.

5

have pled guilty because he was claiming his innocence.

6

Those cases wouldn't change either.

7
8

I kept telling him the

It doesn't require

Those are a good majority of the cases that
come before district and circuit courts.

9

MR. FEIGIN:

So, Your Honor, what we're

10

talking about here is a set of cases where, as the lower

11

courts founds here, the only chance the defendant had at

12

trial was jury nullification or, frankly, some stroke of

13

luck that would collapse the government's case somehow.

14

And in that set of cases, it does not make sense to

15

grant a defendant windfall relief that gives him an

16

opportunity he could never have reasonably expected at

17

the outset.

18

I think the --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I still go back

20

to -- to my earlier point, which is the difference

21

between nine years and five and ten years is very big.

22

For nine months and sure banishment?

23

irrational about going to trial?

24
25

MR. FEIGIN:

What's so

Well, Your Honor, as I

suggested earlier in my colloquy with the Chief Justice,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

I think rationality here has its traditional legal

2

meaning, meaning looking at it through an objectively

3

reasonable len -- a lens of objective reasonableness.

4

And I think that makes great sense here because if that

5

were not the case, then I think Padilla's promise that

6

the ruling would not really be opening Pandora's box,

7

but would instead be cabined by the requirement --

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do we do -- what

do we do with all those defendants who reject pleas with

10

full knowledge and say a rational person must have

11

wanted -- should have taken this case.

12

should vacate because I didn't take my plea.

13

at all the facts and circumstances.

14

of the arguments because it's only a rationality test.

15

MR. FEIGIN:

And so you
Don't look

Don't look at any

Your Honor, we're not saying

16

there's only a rationality test here.

17

the -- there's a threshold inquiry -- and this is where

18

the defendant in Hill failed -- there's a threshold

19

inquiry that this defendant has to say I would have done

20

something differently if my lawyer had given me better

21

advice, constitutionally competent advice.

22

that is what the -- then if we believe that the

23

defendant is credible in saying that, we then go on to

24

the objective portion of the inquiry, which is the --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

First of all,

And then, if

But, Mr. Feigin, again

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

58
1

the -- just in your words, objective reasonableness, why

2

can't a judge find as to a defendant that it is

3

objectively reasonable to give up six or eight or nine

4

months for a shot at staying in this country rather than

5

being deported to a place that you don't know and where

6

you have no ties?

7

that choice, sign me up.

8

I mean, you know, if somebody gave me

So I think of myself as an objectively

9

reasonable human being.

10

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think what

11

objective reasonableness means here -- again, I come

12

back to the way the Court uses the term rational that's

13

used in Padilla and the way it uses it to describe, for

14

example, a rational jury, is the application of the law

15

to the facts and what outcome we would have reached

16

there.

17

And I'm not sure -JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's an objectively

18

reasonable assessment, it's an -- it -- it would be an

19

objectively reasonable choice to exercise my right to a

20

jury trial in that context.

21

whether it's objectively reasonable to make a decision

22

different from the decision that I would have made in

23

this proceeding, which is the plea negotiation.

24
25

MR. FEIGIN:

And that's the question,

So, Your Honor, if you look at

the inquiry that way, I don't think it's acting as any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

sort of meaningful check at all, because you could

2

always make the argument that, yeah, I would have risked

3

two more years, yes, I would have risked five more

4

years, and I don't know how a court can come in and say,

5

you know what, that's not objectively reasonable.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, the court can do it in

7

the way that the Court has done it since 1985 when we

8

said that this was the inquiry under Hill.

9

courts have been doing since -- for the last 30 years.

10

MR. FEIGIN:

This is what

Well, Your Honor, I think the

11

circuit conflict that we have here shows that that's not

12

what all courts have been doing.

13
14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Another point --

It's what many courts have

been doing for three decades.

15

MR. FEIGIN:

I'm not saying -- I'm not

16

saying that a court can't try to do that.

17

that we -- it's very difficult to achieve reliable

18

results.

19

I'm saying

So Petitioner has an example on page 6 of

20

his reply brief of circumstances where a defendant

21

doesn't have very many ties to the United States and

22

just got here, and Petitioner asserts well, in that

23

case, he couldn't possibly have shown that he would have

24

selected a trial.

25

defendant could get up on the stand and say all my life,

But I don't think that's true.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Two quick things.
First, I don't want to lose the point that

plea or go to trial.

6

negotiate other plea alternatives.

7

of those in our reply brief, including one where there

9

who was able to get a plea conviction with lessened

deportation consequences.
And my friend says there's no evidence that

12

could happen here.

13

based on the Sixth Circuit categorical rule, has refused

14

to negotiate throughout the process.

15

Well, that's because the government,

If you look at what happened at that plea

16

colloquy again, even the government believed that

17

Mr. Lee was going to remain in the country.

18

fact that he was willing to serve seven years here

19

instead of just his one voluntarily rather than be

20

deported is strong evidence that there could have been

21

some other arrangement, a meeting in the middle.

22

And the

Second thing about Cooper and Frye, my

23
