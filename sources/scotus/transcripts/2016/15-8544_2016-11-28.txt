ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANICE L. BERGMANN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BERGMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On average, attaching the "career offender"

12

label to a Federal defendant both doubles his sentence

13

and increases it by seven years.

14

was sentenced, a defendant could qualify as a career

15

offender if one or more of his predicate offenses fell

16

within the residual clause of the career offender

17

guideline, and yet all now agree that the residual

18

clause is so unintelligible that it is impossible to

19

discern its meaning.

20

At the time Petitioner

Petitioner here submits three things:

21

First, that invoking a shapeless -- so shapeless a

22

provision to enhance someone's sentence in such a

23

significant way does not comport with due process.

24
25

Second, a ruling that the career offender
residual clause is void for vagueness is substantive

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

and, therefore, has retroactive effect in Petitioner's

2

case.

3

And third, that voiding the residual clause

4

also invalidates the Guidelines commentary that

5

identified Petitioner's offense as a crime of violence.

6
7
8
9

As such, Petitioner is entitled to a
resentencing without the career offender enhancement.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You would agree, would

you not, that, if the commentary counts, if it counts,

10

then there's nothing imprecise about possessing a

11

sawed-off shotgun; right?

12

MS. BERGMANN:

Yes, Your Honor.

I agree

13

that there is nothing imprecise about possession of a

14

sawed-off shotgun.

15

come into play with the commentary is actually at the

16

point where the Commission was interpreting the residual

17

clause in order to identify the possession of a shotgun

18

offense as falling within the residual clause.

19

Where the constitutional concerns

And the reason why that violates due process

20

in part is because the Commission was attempting to

21

clarify a provision that can't be clarified.

22

has held in Johnson that the residual clause --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The Court

But the -- but suppose

24

there were a statute -- and this is a -- I don't mean to

25

interrupt, but this is part of Justice Ginsburg's

question.

2

Suppose there were a statute in Johnson, and

3

it read just like the residual clause, that -- that an

4

example of a dangerous offense is -- or an offense which

5

creates a serious risk is the possession of a sawed-off

6

shotgun.

That was in the statute.

7

MS. BERGMANN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, Your Honor, the -Would the statute then be

valid?

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MS. BERGMANN:

19

Yes, it would be valid.

If the -- if the possession

of a sawed-off shotgun was listed in the statute.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

Justice Ginsburg's question.

22

Commission, the agency, do that?

23

But the -- the

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, you didn't answer
Why can't the Sentencing

Well, Your Honor, because

24

when the Sentencing Commission was interpreting -- when

25

the Sentencing Commission created the commentary, it was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

interpreting the language of the residual clause, and

2

the --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

MS. BERGMANN:

5

Do we know that for sure?

Well, yes, Your Honor, we

know it in several ways.

6

One, the sawed-off shotgun offense can only

7

fall within the residual clause because the text of the

8

Guidelines state three exclusive definitions for the

9

term "crime of violence."

10

Possession of a sawed-off shotgun does not

11

fall within the first definition because there's no

12

element of force.

13

offenses.

14

three exclusive definitions, the only definition it

15

could fall within would be the residual clause.

16

It is not one of the four enumerated

Because the Guidelines states forth these

We also know it because when the Commission

17

amended the commentary to include the possession of a

18

sawed-off shotgun offense, the reasons for amendment

19

stated that it was doing so based on lower court

20

decisions concluding that possession of a sawed-off

21

shotgun fell within the residual clause.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what if the -- the

23

Guidelines themselves said that the term "crime of

24

violence" means, among other things, burglary of a

25

dwelling, arson, extortion, involves use of explosives,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

involves possession of a sawed-off shotgun, or otherwise

2

involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk

3

of physical injury to another?

4

Would there be a vagueness problem then?

5

MS. BERGMANN:

No, Your Honor, but that

6

would be because the -- the offense would be in the text

7

of the Guideline itself.

8
9
10

And here the issue isn't just the vagueness,
but it's also the -- the respect that the Court has to
give to the agency's interpretation of a guideline.

11

And with the commentary here, Your Honor,

12

the -- the Commission was not interpreting the -- its

13

own words -- I mean the text of the Guideline was not

14

language that the Commission itself created.

15

interpreting the enabling statute there.

16

interpreting the exact same words that the Court was

17

interpreting in the Armed Career Criminal Act.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

It was not

It was

But the Guidelines

19

provisions are the -- are the Commission's words.

20

they borrowed them from a statute, but they didn't have

21

to do that?

22

MS. BERGMANN:

No, they didn't.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

But they did.

Now,

So they --

24

they were their words, and they interpreted their words

25

in the commentary.

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. BERGMANN:

Yes, Your Honor, but in terms

2

of the deference that this Court gives to agencies'

3

interpretations of its regulations, where a commission

4

is -- I'm sorry.

5

guideline text, that is not its own words, but it's the

6

words of a -- Congress here.

7

is the same text as the Armed Career Criminal Act.

The Commission, in adopting the career

17

The Guidelines were passed, including

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, the original definition

18

of the career offender guideline did not include, but --

19

but at some point, yes, Your Honor, the Commission

20

passed an amendment that included the residual clause.

21
22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Was it the Commission?

Aren't those amendments approved by Congress?

23

MS. BERGMANN:

Yes, Your Honor, the residual

24

clause, yes.

The text of the Guideline is approved by

25

Congress; the commentary, however, is not.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's my question.

So

2

the commentary is not approved by Congress, and that

3

commentary that added the sawed-off shotgun, was it

4

simultaneous with the adoption of the residual clause to

5

define crime of violence?

6

MS. BERGMANN:

No, Your Honor, it was not.

7

It was adopted in 2004.

8

Guideline that was submitted to Congress for approval.

9

The commentary was adopted in 2004 without Congress's

10

It was not part of the -- the

approval.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me ask you a more -- let

12

me ask you a more fundamental question.

13

want to unduly shock the attorneys who are here from the

14

Sentencing Commission, but imagine there were no

15

sentencing guidelines.

16

And I don't

So you have a criminal provision that says

17

that a person who's convicted of this offense may be

18

imprisoned for not more than 20 years.

19

says.

That's all it

20

Now, is that unconstitutionally vague?

21

MS. BERGMANN:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, Your Honor.
Well, that seems to be a

23

lot -- a lot vaguer than what we have here.

24

you -- how do you reconcile those two propositions?

25

MS. BERGMANN:

So how do

Well, Your Honor, we submit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

that arbitrary determinant sentencing such as with

2

the -- a vague guideline is not the same as an

3

indeterminate sentencing scheme such as the Court

4

described.

5

Our position is that the use of a vague

6

guideline, in fact, is worse than indeterminate

7

sentencing because it systematically injects

8

arbitrariness into the entire sentencing process.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And there is more

10

arbitrariness because of this guideline than there was

11

before the Guidelines were passed?

12

evidence of that?

13
14

Is there any

I have a lot of evidence it wasn't.

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, I think, Your Honor,

it's especially so here because --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Especially so.

Is it so at

all?

can be brief here, because it's really the government

23

that has to answer this question for me.

24

25

don't have to answer more than briefly, but I do have

Alderson Reporting Company

I don't

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

exactly the same question that Justice Alito had.

2

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, I think here, Your

3

Honor, that the Guidelines hold a special -- special

4

place in the sentencing scheme because the court has

5

stated repeatedly that the guide -- the Guidelines are

6

both the lodestone and the lodestar of Federal

7

sentencing, and because of that they are sufficiently

8

binding in a way that an indeterminate sentencing scheme

9

is not.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

right?

12

of departures from the Guidelines.

Well, less and less,

I mean, there are steadily increasing percentage

13

MS. BERGMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor,

14

there is an increasing number of departures from the

15

Guidelines.

16

and the Court has held several times in recent years --

17

in Peugh and Molina-Martinez, the Court recognized that

18

the power that the Guidelines have over the Federal

19

sentences, the Court has recognized that as the

20

Guideline range goes up and down, so too do the

21

applicable sentences.

22

But it does not mean they don't have force,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if the

23

indeterminate sentencing is all right, it would seem to

24

me that even the vaguest guideline would be an

25

improvement and so difficult to argue that it's too

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1
2

vague to be applied.
MS. BERGMANN:

I disagree, Your Honor,

3

because in -- even in an indeterminate sentencing

4

scheme, due process did apply.

5

in Townsend v. Burke and United States v. Tucker

6

indicated that there were due process concerns depending

7

on considerations that the Court was using.

8

was material misinformation.

9

expressed concern about arbitrariness even in an

indeterminate sentencing scheme.
And here, the problem with using a vague

12

guideline is that it injects arbitrariness into every

13

sentencing decision that relies on that guideline.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Are you saying there's more

15

arbitrariness under this provision than there was under

16

the pre-Sentencing Reform Act sentencing system, where a

17

judge would pick a sentence between zero and 20 years

18

based on that judge's personal ideas about retribution,

19

deterrence, and incapacitation?

20

And in practice, there were judges who,

21

under that system, always imposed a very light sentence

22

for a particular offense and other judges who always

23

imposed a heavy sentence for that particular offense.

24
25

MS. BERGMANN:

Yes, Your Honor.

always an individualized determination.

Alderson Reporting Company

But it was

And I would --

2

it was not done in an arbitrary way, whereas the problem

3

with the guideline --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but your argument

5

applies to State systems as well, and you're telling us

6

that the more specific a legislature or an agency tries

7

to make guidance for the judge, the more chance there is

8

for vagueness.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

But, Your Honor -Your argument is sweeping.

13

And you're saying the more specific guidance you give,

14

the more dangers there is of unconstitutionality.

15

That's very difficult to accept.

16

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, I -- Your Honor, I

No, Your Honor.

What I'm

saying --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. BERGMANN:

You like that system.

What I'm saying, Your Honor,

5

is that if the Court is -- if the -- if a court is

6

provided guidance with respect to how it is supposed to

7

impose a sentence -- and here, district courts are

8

required to calculate the Guideline range.

9

required to consider the career offender residual clause

They are

10

in every case.

11

whether a defendant's predicate offenses qualify him for

12

this enhancement that both doubles his sentence and may

extend it by a term of years.

In every case, a court must consider

JUSTICE ALITO:

If I go through the

you know, an arguable vagueness challenge if they were

you think that's sufficiently -- that that's

sufficiently clear to satisfy vagueness concerns if, you

know, you're -- you're guilty of this offense if it

And those are just -- I mean, just open this

3

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, Your Honor, the same

4

concerns expressed in Johnson with respect to the

5

Court's application of the vagueness -- vagueness

6

doctrine in that case.

7

other provisions being ruled vague, and the Court

8

determined that the -- because the career offender --

9

well, the ACCA residual clause, but here the career

Concerns were expressed about

10

offender residual clause uses same language, because it

11

used this very specific combination of a significant

12

risk standard and an ordinary case analysis that it was

13

not combination that rendered it vagueness in -- vague

14

in a unique way that wouldn't implicate other

15

provisions.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Wasn't the essence of

17

our ruling in Johnson that it's one thing to ask a judge

18

to apply a determination to existing facts, as opposed

19

to what happens with the residual clause, which is

20

you're asking a judge to basically fantasize about what

21

the average case is like?

22

MS. BERGMANN:

23
24
25

That's correct, Your Honor.

That -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so Guidelines that

you're being asked to apply to specific facts are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

reviewable by a court, aren't they?

2

We can look at the facts and say, was the

3

judge right?

4

not?

Was this more than minimal planning or

5

Correct?

6

MS. BERGMANN:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's correct, Your Honor.
But it's almost

8

impossible, according to Johnson, to find what an

9

ordinary case would look like because there was no

10

standard of comparison of what ordinary meant.

11

MS. BERGMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

12

And I'm aware of no other legal provisions, no other

13

guidelines that use this ordinary case analysis that

14

forces the court to imagine a typical case and then

15

apply the guidelines in that way.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There are -- there are

17

circuit courts who already permit vagueness challenges

18

to provisions, right?

19

MS. BERGMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

20

The Ninth Circuit has allowed vagueness challenges to

21

Guidelines provisions for decades now, and none has been

22

successful.

23

I mean, what's unusual about the residual

24

clause is that it -- it really is unique among

25

sentencing provisions, and that was in part why the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17

Court was concerned about its application in the Armed

2

Career Criminal Act in Johnson, and it should be equally

3

of -- of concerning nature here.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't know why you run away from the proposition that

problem.

12

proposition, if you say the sentence will be decided by

13

a coin toss, it's not vague.

14

what's going to happen.

15

I mean, if you -- you know, the coin toss

Everybody knows exactly

But it might be arbitrary.

So in that case less would be better.

If

16

you did not have the provision about a coin toss, which

17

narrows the uncertainty, then that would be better.

18

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, Your Honor, I mean,

19

arbitrary is -- arbitrariness is the main concern here

20

with the residual clause, and also with the commentary,

21

because the arbitrariness comes into play when the

22

Commission is interpreting the vague language of the

23

residual clause to conclude that certain offenses fall

24

within it.

25

The Commission was undertaking an effort

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Prior to

Let me --

I'm sorry.
Let me ask you a question

6

that's peculiar to this case, and it's essentially

7

whether the issue we're now debating became moot when

8

this sentence was reduced to 216 months, which is well

9

below the Guidelines range.

10

MS. BERGMANN:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

Yes, Your Honor.
So his sentence, the --

the Guideline range, what was it?

13

MS. BERGMANN:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

MS. BERGMANN:

262 to 327 months?

Yes, Your Honor.
And he got 216 months.

Yes, Your Honor.

He received

16

a reduction in his sentence based on substantial

17

assistance to the government.

18

to be resentenced without the career offender provision,

19

at that resentencing the court would establish a

20

guideline range, choose a sentence within that range,

21

and then apply the same 40 percent reduction based on

22

his substantial assistance to whatever sentence the

23

judge -- the judge came up with at that resentencing --

And it

was a 40 percent reduction based on his substantial -JUSTICE BREYER:

This is -- this is a fairly

8

deep question, actually, you're going into, in my mind.

9

And what is -- before I reached a constitutional

10

question, I would ask whether the Guideline falls within

11

the scope of the words "Guideline-enabling statute."

12

don't see why you have to get into the Constitution.

13

But even doing it that way, it then becomes

14

a matter of the extent to which the Federal courts are

15

going to review the substantive Guidelines, itself an

16

open question.

17

So rather than get into that, I might think

18

about your case like this:

19

It was vague because with three examples preceding the

20

residual clause, they tried to apply it, Congress, to

21

thousands of State criminal statutes that vary in a

22

variety of ways one from the other.

23

the problem, I think.

24
25

I

Why was the statute vague?

That's what caused

Now, if that was the problem, that isn't
present here because these apply to Federal statutes.

Moreover, they don't apply to State statutes.

You're right.

step further.

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, you're -- you're

No, Your Honor -But I have -- I have -- I'm

conceding, because one way of clarifying the kind of

16

vagueness that's there in the statute is through

17

example.

18

we might never had to get to that constitutional issue.

19

If we'd had twenty examples instead of three,

So here, what the Commission did was provide

20

some examples.

21

a sawed-off shotgun.

22

That's all.

And one of the examples was

So why isn't that sufficient?

I mean, there

Because similar reasons?

And now we have an effort to cure.

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

And why isn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

that good enough?

2
3

MS. BERGMANN:
because -- sorry.

4

Well, Your Honor, because --

I should just keep my mouth shut.

Because, Your Honor, I believe that the

5

Court has held that the residual clause has no meaning.

6

And because it has no meaning, the Commission is in no

7

better place to interpret or clarify that language.

8

Where language is meaningless, how can it be clarified?

9

And the Court struggled with this, as you

10

said.

And prior to Johnson and James and Sykes and

11

Begay and Chambers, the Court attempted to narrow and

12

clarify this language and provide examples.

13

very reasons that Your Honor states, it was impossible

14

to do so.

15

But for the

And the career offender provision is even

16

broader than the Armed Career Criminal Act because the

17

instant offense also has to qualify.

18

Career Criminal Act, it was limited simply to felon in

19

possession.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In the Armed

Well, why is this -- I

21

guess the real question on this last point is:

22

we're trying to do is to regulate the defendant's

23

conduct, not possessing this thing or not committing a

24

crime of violence, and he knows because the commentary

25

tells him that if he does possess a sawed-off shotgun,

Alderson Reporting Company

If what

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

he's going to get this enhancement, what's arbitrary at

2

sentencing for imposing what the defendant already knows

3

is illegal or will subject him to the greater

4

enhancement?

5

I buy your argument in terms of it would be

6

arbitrary to the Johnson reasoning to have a judge

7

determine that a sawed-off shotgun --

8

MS. BERGMANN:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Here, Your Honor --- is violent in one

10

situation but not in another.

11

arbitrariness is the arbitrariness and capriciousness of

12

enforcement, here the defendant knew that he was going

13

to be subject to the enhancement at the time he

14

committed the crime.

15

MS. BERGMANN:

But if the issue of

But the arbitrary here and

16

the enforcement here comes into play when it is the

17

Commission interpreting the language of the residual

18

clause.

19

interprets the residual clause to include possession of

20

a sawed-off shotgun, the district court has no

21

discretion not to apply that Guideline.

22

the Commission's arbitrary --

23
24
25

The district court -- once the Commission

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
apply the Guideline.

And so it is

I agree no discretion to

But --

MS. BERGMANN:

No discretion -- I'm sorry --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

to ignore the Guideline.

2

that this offense falls within the residual clause,

3

district courts have to apply it.

4

basically directly requiring the Court to apply or

5

enforce arbitrary provision.

6

Once the Commission states

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so it is

How is this different

7

from all of the examples the government gave in pages 55

8

to 57 or the others where we've had a vague statute and

9

the administrative agency has narrowed it, or you have a

10

municipal ordinance that narrows, that the city narrows

11

in its administrative processes?

12

when they are challenged for vagueness, we look at how

13

the statute is applied to the individual.

14

And all of those cases

How is this situation any different?

If the

15

statute was vague, it's vague.

16

instead is say, no, it's not vague, because the agency

17

has narrowed its application.

18
19
20

MS. BERGMANN:

And what we've done

Well, two responses, Your

Honor.
With respect to the cases involving State

21

and local provisions and ordinances, the Court, as a

22

matter of Federalism, has to look to the clarifying

23

constructions that the State court or agency or local

24

governing body has given to that language and accept it

25

to be an interpretation of a statutory provision or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

whatever the provision is and accept that as a

2

clarifying construction of the State provision.

3

With respect to respecting the decisions or

4

the clarifying actions of a regulatory body, a Federal

5

regulatory body, the Court will do that only in certain

6

situations.

7

be afforded to the agency's interpretation of the career

8

offender guideline in part because, as I said, the

9

agency is interpreting not its own words, but Congress's

And here, that kind of deference should not

10

words.

11

chevron deference is not afforded.

12

And in that respect, under Gonzales, the kind of

The same is true here with respect to

13

Seminole Rock deference, which is what Stinson deference

14

for the Guidelines relies upon or deference, as the

15

Court also calls it.

16

interpreting ambiguous language.

17

among ascertainable meanings in selecting the commentary

18

as providing -- I'm sorry -- selecting possession of a

19

sawed-off shotgun as an offense that fell within the

20

residual clause.

21

vague language that had no meaning.

22

respect, it is not entitled to the deference in the same

23

way that other interpretations of the Guidelines might

24

be.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Dreeben.

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6
7

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The threshold question in this case is one

8

of retroactivity, whether the rule that Petitioner seeks

9

would be retroactive to cases on collateral review if

10
11

the Court were to adopt it.
In view of the questions from Justice Breyer

12

and Justice Alito and others on the bench, I think it

13

may be useful to start at the outset to describe what we

14

think the Due Process Rule is in this case and why it

15

does not call into question traditional discretionary

16

sentencing within a broad range that is not informed by

17

sentencing guidelines.

18

So I think the starting point for analysis

19

here is due process.

20

require that all provisions of law not be vague in some

21

customary dictionary sense.

22

fundamental fairness.

23

fairness, the Court examines history and practice.

24
25

Due process does not itself

Due process protects

And when looking at fundamental

Now, the history of this country has
included discretionary sentencing within a range without

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

any guidance to the judge since the 1790 Crimes Act.

2

And through much of the 19th century, many statutes were

3

written that way.

4

The idea that due process vagueness analysis

5

would somehow invalidate that contradicts cases like

6

Medina, which take as their touchstone for due process

7

historical practice.

8
9

I also think that the purposes of what later
was announced as the vagueness doctrine are not

10

implicated in traditional sentencing.

11

that is not that traditional sentencing produces uniform

12

or predictable results.

13

instead another important value of sentencing, which is

14

individualization or proportionality.

15

It does not.

The reason for

It maximizes

Sentencing involves a large array of facts

16

that are very difficult to reduce to rules.

17

traditional sentencing process relies on the judge and

18

the defendant, in the courtroom with counsel, to examine

19

the multiplicity of facts that bear on appropriate

20

sentencing and then to select a sentence within that

21

range.

22

That is not arbitrary.

The

We have cited in

23

footnote 2 of our reply brief a case from this Court

24

where the Court described that as conscientious judgment

25

rather than arbitrary action.

It therefore does not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

implicate the purpose of the due-process vagueness

2

doctrine.

3

On the other hand, the Sentencing Guidelines

4

as this Court has described them in recent opinions that

5

have examined the advisory system that's been put into

6

place post-Booker, stress that that system injects law

7

into the sentencing process.

8

the Guidelines range.

9

throughout the sentencing process.

10

The judge must calculate

The judge must be cognizant of it

That Guidelines range informs the judge's

11

selection of a sentence because the judge knows that it

12

reflects the considered expert views of the Sentencing

13

Commission filtered through congressional policy.

14

because of those features of the sentencing system in

15

the district court, the Court has described the

16

Guidelines range as having an anchoring effect, which

17

tends to influence sentences if intended to do so, and

18

has that effect, and it is continuing to have that

19

effect.

20

And

Since 2011, the rate of within range of

21

government-sponsored departures in the Guidelines has

22

remained relatively constant.

23

significantly.

24

range.

25

It has not dropped

It's still at around the 80 percent

JUSTICE ALITO:

So basically, your argument

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

is that there's a continuum, so that if you have

2

complete judicial discretion, barring the consideration

3

of some impermissible invidious factor, within the

4

statutory guideline range, there's no vagueness problem.

5

On the other hand, if you have mandatory

6

guidelines, you may have to apply vagueness principles

7

to the mandatory guidelines.

8
9
10

Now, here it -- so someplace in the middle
you get -- you are close enough to the mandatory that
that has to apply.

11

That's -- that's your argument?

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

And we have not taken a

12

position on the mandatory guidelines in this case.

13

an advisory guidelines case, but the Court's description

14

of --

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's

Well, if advisory guidelines

16

are subject to vagueness challenges, then surely

17

mandatory guidelines would be subject to vagueness --

18
19
20
21
22

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, for vagueness.

But I'm

talking about retroactivity.
JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

So it's for

vagueness purposes.
Now, suppose what the Court had said is the

23

Guidelines are purely advisory.

Now, you know,

24

they're -- the Sentencing Commission, very respected

25

group, studied the problem; judges, you really ought to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

read them, you ought to take them into account, but in

2

the end, it's your call, based on the factors that are

3

set out in the Sentencing Reform Act.

4

Would the result be the same?

5

MR. DREEBEN:

I think it would depend,

6

Justice Alito, on how the Guidelines were implemented

7

and whether additional rules that were procedural in

8

character, designed to reinforce the primacy of the

9

Guidelines, were adopted.

10

question in the abstract.

11

It's hard to answer that

What we do know today is that, based on the

12

analysis in Peugh and Molina-Martinez, and the further

13

refinements that the Court has discussed and addressed

14

in cases like Rita and Gall, the Guidelines do have a

15

significant lodestar or lodestone effect in the

16

sentencing process.

17

On appeal, a court of appeals may consider a

18

within-range sentence presumably reasonable.

19

legal features of the system lead the Court in the Peugh

20

case to apply the ex post facto clause to changes in the

21

advisory range.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

And these

But what will happen ten

23

years from now?

Let's say ten years from now when you

24

have -- there's no district judge anymore who even

25

remembers the mandatory guideline regime and there are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

departures in 85 percent of the cases, and the judges go

2

through the drill.

3

Guidelines and all of that, but then they go on and

4

impose the type of sentence that they think adequately

5

serves the legitimate purposes of sentencing.

6

your argument be the same then?

7

They -- you know, they calculate the

MR. DREEBEN:

Would

Well, we -- we made a version

8

of that argument in Peugh and this Court rejected it,

9

and I think empirical evidence is not suggesting that

10

sentencing courts are drifting radically away from the

11

Guidelines, and one of the reasons for that is there's a

12

feedback loop in place where the Commission examines the

13

Guidelines in practice, takes note when district judges

14

are varying or departing from them, and incorporates

15

those refinements into the Guidelines.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, maybe not

17

radically departing, but steadily increasing their

18

departures, isn't that right?

19

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think so,

20

Mr. Chief Justice.

I looked at the statistics this

21

weekend, and there is a trend line that hovers around

22

the 80 percent level for within-range sentences, plus

23

the government-sponsored departures, which are

24

incorporated into the Guidelines and recognized as not

25

being non-guideline sentence because the government is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

seeking them within the framework of the Guidelines.

2

So the Guidelines are continuing to have an

3

influential role in Federal sentencing, as they are

4

intended to do precisely because the Commission is

5

looking at the same 3553(a) factors that the district

6

court judge does.

7

actual experience in sentencing and refines the

8

Guidelines in order to incorporate those improvements

9

into it.

The Commission takes into account

Courts of appeals can presume within-range

10

sentences reasonable on appeal which the Court

11

recognized in Rita --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that that

13

explanation is in conflict and considerable tension with

14

your argument that this is not -- that this is

15

procedural.

16
17
18
19
20
21
22

Why is that substantive?
MR. DREEBEN:

So I think, Justice Kennedy,

that the -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It appears that you're

taking two different positions on these points.
MR. DREEBEN:

And I think that's because

there are two different legal tests that are in play.
The vagueness doctrine is looking at the

23

potential for lack of notice and arbitrary action.

24

I think arbitrariness is the essential complaint about a

25

vague guideline that results in something that is little

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

better than a coin flip as to whether a person is

2

treated as a career offender or not.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but you say the

4

vagueness challenge analysis applies because this whole

5

class is affected.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that seems to me

8

inconsistent with saying that they're procedural because

9

they don't play a dispositive role.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

They play an important role.

11

I think dispositive is not the right statement.

12

test in retroactivity is much stricter than the question

13

of whether due process should apply.

14

The

The test in retroactivity, as this Court

15

most recently articulated it in the Montgomery case and

16

again in the Welch case, is whether a rule alters the

17

range of conduct or the class of persons who is punished

18

in a way such as, effectively, to make the person no

19

longer eligible for the criminal sentence that the

20

government seeks.

21

responds to the very compelling finality concerns in the

22

habeas context that are different from when the Court is

23

examining what the Constitution requires.

24
25

And that test is narrow, because it

JUSTICE BREYER:

Here's a thing I'd like you

to think about, and -- and tell me what you think.

Alderson Reporting Company

This

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

is -- this is what's bothering me about the government's

2

position.

3

It's important, the government's position.
Put in your mind the words that we're

4

talking about, "or otherwise involves conduct that

5

presents a serious potential risk of physical injury."

6

Okay?

7

appear in the guideline.

8

appear in the statute.

Those are the words.

9

Put them over here; they

Put them over here; they

When they appear in the statute, they have a

10

meaning, and it's fairly limited, and there's likely to

11

be one.

12

meaning.

13

And eventually there will be an authoritative

When it appears over here in the guideline,

14

it could be viewed as having an authoritative meaning or

15

it could be viewed as leaving up to the district judge

16

the job of interpreting these sensibly in the case, just

17

like we used to do.

18

And then the Commission goes around first to

19

review it for reasonableness at the court of appeals,

20

and then the Commission goes through the feedback

21

process that you -- that you describe.

22

Now, that would mean, one, a system that

23

works itself towards a more logical, sensible approach

24

in terms of punishment, and it also would mean that the

25

normal words vagueness in the Constitution, or, if you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

like, feed it through the statutory enabling

2

legislation, it would -- it would mean that it would

3

have different meanings in the two constitutional versus

4

statute versus guideline.

5

be to get better guidelines.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

But the purpose of that would

So, Justice Breyer, I agree

7

with the impulse of that question to the extent that

8

we're talking about the enumerated offenses in the

9

commentary.

I think that those, whether they are viewed

10

as construing the language of the residual clause or

11

providing an independent specification of what is a

12

crime of violence, they satisfy due process vagueness

13

concerns.

14

Where I part company with that description

15

of how the constitutional analysis is affected is that

16

the Commission selected the residual clause language to

17

mirror the ACCA residual clause.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

We know that because this

19

is -- the words I read you are just one set of what I

20

bet are hundreds of examples in these Guidelines if you

21

go through and think it doesn't make too much sense.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think -- no, I'd like

23

to come back to whether the Guidelines are vague as a

24

general matter, because I don't think they are.

25

a lot of time going through them this weekend, and I was

Alderson Reporting Company

I spent

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

amazed at how specific they are and how they do mirror

2

things that are customarily elements of offense.

3

Serious bodily injury is a very customary element of the

4

offense.

5

The Guidelines were framed to be

6

administrable in factual and judgmental ways that courts

7

administer all the time in criminal law.

8
9

What was different about the residual clause
is that the Court wasn't -- Congress instructed the

10

Commission to put together a career offender guideline

11

that covered people who had crimes of violence or

12

serious drug offenses for their instant offense and two

13

others and they were older than 18.

14

The Commission originally defined crime of

15

violence by borrowing the Section 16(b) definition of

16

crime of violence which Congress adopted in the same act

17

that passed the Sentencing Reform Act.

18

It later switched to the ACCA definition,

19

the residual clause that this Court later invalidated in

20

Johnson.

21

Instead of saying "burglary," it said "burglary of a

22

dwelling," but it otherwise consciously sought to adopt

23

the ACCA framework, and I think it did so largely to

24

simplify the administration of complicated criminal

25

history determinations in recidivism cases in Federal

It made one tweak to the enumerated offenses.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1
2

prosecutions.
It added to that specifications of

3

particularized offenses, which it had done before when

4

Section 16(b) language was controlling.

5

had a list of enumerated offenses in the commentary, and

6

it refined those slightly, but it retained them.

7

So it always

So I think the proper way to look at this is

8

that the Commission was seeking to model this language

9

on congressional statutes in the ACCA, and courts across

10

the country heeded that by interchangeably citing

11

Sentencing Guidelines, residual clause cases, and ACCA

12

residual clause cases.

13

So when this Court in Johnson overruled the

14

two sentencing residual clause cases that had come out

15

in favor of the government and said that the residual

16

clause was vague across the board, sentencing courts no

17

longer had a legal framework at all to interpret the

18

residual clause except for the commentary.

19

commentary provides specificity.

The

20

But the methodology that this Court

21

condemned as producing a shapeless provision, a

22

provision that was a black hole of uncertainty and

23

confusion, that language existed, and the problem with

24

that from a due process point of view is that it leads

25

to arbitrary assignments of classifications, such as the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

career offender classification or the firearms

2

guideline, which also keys on prior crimes of violence

3

that the defendant had in his history, and it leads to

4

the assignment of a range which then serves as the

5

anchor for sentencing that it provides an arbitrary

6

framework.

7

The judge thinks that the commission intends

8

that this individual be treated as a career offender or

9

somebody who has a firearms offense with a crime of

10

violence in his background, but the judge has no way of

11

knowing whether that is arbitrary or non-arbitrary

12

because the commission, having borrowed vague language,

13

ends with up with a vague statute.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Dreeben, can we go

15

back to Justice Kennedy's question?

In Montgomery, we

16

had a rule that appeared procedural, just like this one.

17

The judge at sentencing could still sentence the

18

defendant to life without parole after a particular

19

finding, i.e., that the individual was irredeemable.

20

Why is that different than here?

21

if the Guidelines are procedural in the Montgomery sense

22

because they are an anchor on what a judge does, why

23

isn't there a substantial risk like in Montgomery that a

24

defendant is going to be sentenced because of the

25

Guideline and not because of a finding that he or she is

Alderson Reporting Company

Meaning,

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

entitled to that sentence?

2

And I take that to be -- that substantial

3

risk to be proven by your own statistic.

4

judges sentence within the Guidelines.

5

importantly for those circuits that have permitted or --

6

or have applied retroactive activity to Johnson and

7

defendants have been resentenced, the vast majority have

8

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, this

Court's Teague jurisprudence says that in a collateral

review case, a habeas case, the threshold question is

7

retroactivity because if the new rule that the

Petitioner seeks would not be retroactive to cases on

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's like jurisdiction,

that we are bound, we have no choice but to decide

retroactivity before deciding anything else.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

It's not a jurisdictional

limitation.

Teague is a doctrine that this Court

16

framed, Justice Alito, if the Court wanted to decide

something else before then, but the reason why the

justice right now in the wake of this Court's decision

that one judge could have put different values on a

MR. MORTARA:

I don't think so, when one

looks at the sentencing factors in 3553(a)(2), the

purposes of sentencing that my friends both agree are

not subject to vagueness challenges.

22

even more vague than the career offender enhancement --

that, yes, all that you say is true, but this is a

amounts to an argument that because the career offender

more subject to constitutional vagueness challenges.

rely on how sentencing used to work in order to save

It is that -- it is saying you can't

Then what was worrying me in our

8

conversation is I could think of other parts of the

9

Guidelines; for example, the part that deals with

10

concurrent versus consecutive sentencing, which, you

11

know, is a nightmare and is also the notion of a kind of

12

on-off rule, and I'm afraid of what we would do here.

See, that's where I a.m. in this.

saying don't go ahead, go ahead.

trying to make a qualitative difference in what we're

talking about here.

17

MR. MORTARA:

I do want to get back to the

18

(a)(2) factors, but I -- I'll address your question

19

directly.

20

My friend said that the problem here is

21

Molina-Martinez and Peugh and the weight that the

22

Guidelines are given.

23

from Rita, which says that -- that an appellate court

24

can presume a within-Guideline sentence is reasonable,

25

because that reflects the judgment of both the

And that weight in part comes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

Commission and the sentencing judge that the 3553(a)

2

factors have been met.

3

But that's actually not true with the career

4

offender enhancement, and that's because the career

5

offender enhancement exists at the command of Congress

6

in 994(h).

7

expertise when it made the career offender enhancement.

8

It's doing something it was commanded to do, which is

9

make sure that sentences get at or near the statutory

10

The Commission is not actually deploying its

maximum.

11

So the rationale for the reasonableness

12

presumption of Rita completely goes away with the career

13

offender guideline, and that's why the career offender

14

enhancement should not get that kind of weight and

15

that's why it doesn't.

16

My friend referred to 80 percent of

17

sentences being within Guidelines ranges.

18

75 percent outside of the Guidelines ranges -- Guideline

19

ranges for career offenders.

20

offenders in 2015 got within the Guidelines-range

21

sentences.

departures to be sure.

23

30 percent of career offenders got below Guideline-range

24

sentences without the government sponsoring them.

25

It's

Only 25 percent of career

And some of that is government-sponsored
But an astounding nearly

And what's going on there is that judges are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

not giving the career offender enhancement as much

2

weight as Molina-Martinez and Peugh are talking about

3

because it doesn't come from a Commission's expertise on

4

the 3553(a) factors, and the Rita rationale is gone and

5

because sentencing judges are commanded to consider the

6

very facts of the offense and the criminal history that

7

they were deprived of considering under the ACCA.

8
9

In Johnson, the Court made very clear that
the saving construction offered by one of the other

10

opinions, the so-called criminal history or record-based

11

approach, was not available as a matter of statutory

12

interpretation.

13

factor (a)(1), a sentencing judge must consider those

14

facts.

15

But under the sentencing guidelines in

So to take the example from Johnson, a

16

variety in a correctional institution under Connecticut

law under the categorical approach, probably a crime of

18

violence, but there might be the rare violence-free

19

riot.

20

at what actually happened and look at the severe effect

21

of the career offender enhancement and then sentence

22

below the range.

23

A sentencing judge under the Guidelines can look

And that is what is, in fact, happening,

24

because judges are looking at the facts, and they are

25

not acting like automatons blindly adhering to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

Guidelines whatever their weight.

2

But coming back to the (a)(2) factors -- and

3

I do want to come back to them -- in 1984, the (a)(2)

4

factors were enacted.

5

definition.

6

is the Sentencing Guidelines require numerical range.

7

The (a)(2) factors lead to a specific number, a fixed

8

sentence in the mind of the judge.

Which is more

9

arbitrary or provides less notice?

That's easy.

10

They are vague by anyone's

And the only answer we get from my friends

The only other explanation we get is the

11

weight afforded to the Guidelines.

I've already

12

mentioned that a little bit, but another way we can

13

think about it is a district judge is allowed to deviate

14

from the Guidelines if it disagrees with them as a

15

matter of policy.

16

district judge cannot declare that they disagree with

17

the purposes in (a)(2) and say, I a.m. now going to

18

sentence under my theory of radical over-deterrence,

19

instead of adequate deterrence.

20

reversible error under all of this Court's precedents.

21

So whatever weight Molina-Martinez and Peugh say should

22

be given to the Guidelines, the (a)(2) purposes have

23

actually equal or more weight, because a district judge

24

cannot disagree with them.

2

And in that respect, it goes from

3

And they are vague.

And if you accept that

10

accept that (a)(2) purposes are not subject to a

11

constitutional vagueness challenge, it seems extremely

12

difficult to accept that the career offender enhancement

13

is somehow subject to a constitutional vagueness

14

challenge either because of the numerical range, it's a

15

fixed number for (a)(2), or because of the weight for

16

the reasons I've given.

17

One other thing I wanted to raise, which is

related to questions Justice Sotomayor was asking about

Official - Subject to Final Review

54

The second is, sometimes the -- the

2

defendant was originally sentenced under Booker, or

3

pre-Booker, so mandatory guidelines.

4

The third is that in some of these cases --

5

and I've looked at the government's sentencing

6

referendum -- the United States has gone in and said,

7

well, because the Commission has gotten rid of the

8

residual clause, we would like the defendant's sentence

9

to reflect the way sentences are going to be going

10

forward, so we're asking you to impose a lower sentence

11

because we want things to look, in the future, the way

12

they are going to look for this defendant today.

13

All of those things are confounders on the

14

actual effect that the career offender guideline had in

15

its original form on the defendant's sentence.

16

take an example of Mr. Beckles, we talked a lot about
