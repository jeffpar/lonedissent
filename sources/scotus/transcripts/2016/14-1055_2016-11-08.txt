MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

There is only one natural way to read the

language at issue here.

14

of subject-matter jurisdiction.

16

with the plain language.

17

A "court of competent

So let's start

The statute grants Freddie, quote, "The

18

power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any

19

'court of competent jurisdiction,' State or Federal."

20

The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to

21

say that you don't get to go to any Federal court or any

22

State court, but rather, you have to choose a court,

23

State or Federal, that must be a "court of competent

jurisdiction."

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does that include --

4

you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but "is

5

this court competent to hear this controversy" would

6

include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you

7

limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?

8
9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I -- I am not limiting it

to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action.

10

It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction.

11

court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has

12

subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has

13

personal jurisdiction.

19

jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those

20

cases.

And this Court held, hold on.

Wait a

It's not enough just to have subject-matter

It needs to be personal jurisdiction.

21

Now, five times this Court has interpreted

22

the words "competent jurisdiction" to mean, quote,

23

"outside" -- "outside sources of jurisdictional

24

authority."

25

this Court held that any reference to competent

2

competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, "it

3

unquestionably meant that the competency of the court

4

should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in

5

respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts."

6

And Fannie's interpretation simply does not

7

map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.

8

Look at the sentence.

9

require the Court to read the phrase "competent

Fannie's interpretation would

10

jurisdiction" to mean different things depending upon

11

which word modifies it.

12

So Fannie concedes that the clause referring

13

to any "court of competent jurisdiction" State cannot be

14

read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court.

15

State court can't take jurisdiction unless you point to

16

a statutory authority for the State.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What did you do -- what

18

does Justice Souter's statement in Red Cross do to your

19

argument?

20

of Red Cross, "In expressly authorizing suit in Federal

21

court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate

22

capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal

23

jurisdiction."

24
25

I'm talking about the statement on page 257

That seems to say if you authorize suit in
Federal court, then that's it.

Specifically mentioning

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that

5

Justice Souter was describing.

6

quote, "A congressional charter's sue-and-be-sued

7

provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if,

8

but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal

9

courts."

10

And I think the way to look at Red Cross is

The rule is, and I

order to even have a conversation about whether the

12

"may" is in play.

13

not sufficient.

But a reference to Federal courts is

14

And so another way to think about it is,

15

sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court,

16

State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without

17

more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.

24

And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,

2

and isn't just a general statement of courts in

4

It's just not just authority to sue and be sued.

5

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, I disagree

6

respectfully with how they -- how you've characterized

7

these cases.

8
9

So Osborn, if you wanted to write a
provision that parses the legislative language the way

10

Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision.

11

says, sue and be sued in all State courts having

12

competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit

13

14

State courts.

That's how you distinguish

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Okay.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

D'Oench, Duhme, my God, is

18

the -- that's identical to the Bankers' one.

19

And they come out the other way, and all that's there is

20

the word "State and Federal" --

21

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Identical.

So, Your Honor, D'Oench,

22

Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or

23

Federal.

24

D'Oench, Duhme, and so there's nothing -- we can't

figure out what this Court was saying in D'Oench because

answer is that provision -- excuse me.

But -- but I would also say just mapping,
again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the

10

statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this

11

clause that says, "court of competent jurisdiction"

12

State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction

13

to every Federal court either.

14

The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.

15

The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent

16

jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements

17

are otherwise satisfied.

18

And Fannie has never explained how you can

19

take the same language and map it out differently to

20

reach different results depending upon which word it

21

modifies and even different results when it modifies the

22

same word.

23
24
25

And the statutory evolution also confirms
this.

It unfolded in three critical steps.
Step 1 was the original enactment.

Alderson Reporting Company

It was

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

before D'Oench.

2

Justice Breyer's question, it was assured would not

3

grant jurisdiction.

4

And Congress chose language that, per

Step 2 was 1954.

So now D'Oench has been

5

decided.

And what did Congress do?

It did the opposite

6

of what happened in Red Cross.

7

there was a provision that didn't match D'Oench, and

8

then Congress takes a left turn and says, we're going to

9

match D'Oench.

In Red Cross, remember,

Here, Congress began with a provision

10

that matched what was later assessed in D'Oench and took

11

a right turn and added the words "competent

12

jurisdiction," which this Court had previously, for

13

example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, "depends on

14

other provisions of law."

15

Step 3 was 1974.

After the shift to private

16

entity was consummated, Congress further amended the

17

charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity

18

jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal

19

jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no

20

longer an agency.

21

in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose

22

for diversity jurisdiction.

23

Fannie's charter to say that it is a District of

24

Columbia corporation, quote, "for purposes of

25

jurisdiction and venue."

If there was a source of jurisdiction

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's arguably to

keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor.

"For

4

purposes of venue" doesn't mean all suits are in D.C. It

5

could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but

6

look to the venue provisions to figure out where the

7

suit is appropriately brought.

8
9

This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction.
Every court that has ever evaluated this language has

10

concluded it's a grant of diversity jurisdiction.

11

Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the

12

only basis being diversity jurisdiction.

13

times since this case was first briefed, and just last

14

Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that

15

this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction.

16

need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued

17

clause that grants Federal jurisdiction.

24

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

25

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1
2

MS. O'CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

3

The government's view is that the rule of

4

Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that

5

authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or

6

be sued in a "court of competent jurisdiction."

7

The best reading of that phrase in Fannie

8

Mae's charter is that it authorizes the corporation to

9

sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is

10

vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of

11

law.

12

We think there is a plausible story for why

13

Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued

14

clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if

15

you don't find that explanation completely satisfying,

16

the text of the statute should control.

17

The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell

18

Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity

19

may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State

20

or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that

21

Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the

22

Federal courts.

23

In this case, the Court should give Congress

24

the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language

25

"suit is authorized in a State or Federal 'court of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

competent jurisdiction,'" then that means that you have

2

to look to some other provision of law to see if that

3

court is vested with jurisdiction.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I've done -- or had --

5

my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been

6

able to identify, eight other statutes that use the

7

"incompetent jurisdiction" language.

8
9

Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number
of other statutes that are identical to this?

And, B,

10

are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes

11

may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie

12

Mae is?

13

MS. O'CONNELL:

I -- I am aware of those

14

statutes.

I have on my list seven that just have the

15

sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that

16

says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving

17

this entity.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

MS. O'CONNELL:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

We are off by one.

Right.
But tell me what you

mean.

22

MS. O'CONNELL:

So, no, I am not troubled by

23

this.

In fact, I think this is the reason, two of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MS. O'CONNELL:

No, the Federal agencies

5

have the power to bring a suit in Federal court.

They

6

also have the power to remove a case from Federal court.

7

But if the Court interpret's Fannie's charter to mean

8

that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a

9

Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then

10

all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party

11

or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be

12

brought in Federal court against the agency, and they

13

can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is

14

a party.

15

I'll give you an example that HUD has given

to me over time.

If the Court were to say that the language

3

which is also in HUD's charter, that it can sue or be

4

sued in any State or Federal court of competent

5

jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter

6

over that suit, then the private party can now remove

7

the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the

8

resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the

9

borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit.

10

HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued

11

clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not

12

to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction

13

over any case involving HUD.

Right, but it --

Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says,

16

"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any

18

So I think in that case what the Court said

19

was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on

20

all circuit courts of the United States.

21

the language "court of competent jurisdiction" when it

22

referred to the Federal courts.

23

only with respect to the State courts.

It's -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case

2

was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as

3

Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae's charter

used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked

5

exactly the same as the FDIC's, which the Court said in

6

D'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in

7

1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.

8

One of the main rationales of the court of

9

appeals in this case was that the -- the work that

10

"court of competent jurisdiction" is doing is that it's

11

telling you that you can't file suit in a specialized

12

court, like a State traffic court or a Federal

13

bankruptcy court.

14

"court of competent jurisdiction" would tell you to do

MS. O'CONNELL:

in Federal court, per the Court's decisions in D'Oench,

4

Duhme and in Red Cross.

5

If that's the way --

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what we have to say is,

6

once you added these words "in any competent

7

jurisdiction," what they did, those words took the case

8

out of Federal court unless it's some other basis for

9

getting there and require you to go to State court, and

10

to subtract words -- God, it's -- I mean, as a matter of

11

the English language, it just seems a little tough.

MS. O'CONNELL:

No, no.

I think as a matter

of an English language that's our strongest point.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MS. O'CONNELL:

It is.
That natural reading of that

16

phrase, a "court of competent jurisdiction" means that

17

you have to look somewhere else to determine if the

court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a "court of

19

competent jurisdiction."

The Court has observed that about various

The Respondents refer to the Federal

just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal

There's a few other textual points that I

think reinforce the point we are trying to make.

One is

15

that Section 1349 should be an important point of

reference.

17

having a government charter is not enough to confer

18

Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United

19

States owns 50 percent of the corporation's stock, and

20

when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie

from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. BROOKS

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

5

MR. BROOKS:

Mr. Brooks.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

6

The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong

7

and long-standing rule going back through D'Oench,

8

Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for

9

Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal

10

policy through the corporate form.

11

Now, when Congress expressly provides that a

12

federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue

13

and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction

14

under D'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and

15

their prodigy.

16

Congress can obviously displace that rule if

17

it wants to.

18

that.

19

as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that

20

rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency.

21

the words "competent jurisdiction" is pretty weak tea as

22

a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise

23

existed, particularly given the history of what was

24

going on.

4

That's what competent jurisdiction means.

5

MR. BROOKS:

Does it have

Is there basis for

Right.

So -- so, Your Honor,

6

what competent jurisdiction means here has to be

7

understood in light of the whole phrase.

8

Petitioners' case, as you just heard it presented, is

9

all about the idea that the only phrase is "competent

10
11

jurisdiction."

And

That is not the whole phrase.

The whole phrase is, "competent

12

jurisdiction, State or Federal."

That entire phrase had

13

been interpreted three times in three different

14

appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing

15

agency in the same statute, and that is the language

16

that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954.

17

those appellate decisions at that time, every one of

18

them, held that the full phrase "court of competent

19

jurisdiction, State or Federal," conferred jurisdiction.

20

I'm talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans

21

case, and the Seven Oaks case.

Each of

22

Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that

23

the language it was borrowing from another agency in the

24

same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would

25

restrict Fannie Mae's access to Federal court, and that

Alderson Reporting Company

history shows the distinction.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

But why didn't they do

the same thing in Ginnie Mae?

4

MR. BROOKS:

Well, Ginnie --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They chose very

6

different language, so doesn't that show a conscious

7

act.

MR. BROOKS:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me

make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae

10

historically has had the identical language to Fannie

11

Mae.

12

Corporation, they changed their language in the '54

13

statute to remove the word "Federal."

14

reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that

15

time, was truly a Federal agency.

16

Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance

We think the

Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says,

17

was transitioning into a new structure, right?

18

would eventually be private ownership.

20

the Petitioners mean here.

21

language, the language that had been interpreted in the

22

'40s, and, again, at the time of the '54 Act there had

23

been no case which had held that language didn't confer

24

jurisdiction.

25

There

And the idea

They wanted to adopt the FHA

Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29

Court that have interpreted the phrase "competent

2

jurisdiction."

3

about those cases is the number of those five cases that

4

interpreted "competent jurisdiction" together with the

5

phrase "State or Federal" is zero.

6

Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked

7

at the two phrases together.

What this Court needs to understand

No case, not

8

And when counsel argues that the phrase

9

"competent jurisdiction" needs a separate source of

10

jurisdiction, they are right.

The separate source of

11

jurisdiction is the phrase "State or Federal" if the

12

Court's rule in Red Cross means anything.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, your -- your

14

position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as

15

you have the word "Federal" -- "State" or "Federal,"

you're home free.

they don't mean anything.

So the three things we think competent

2

jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of

3

the New Deal of the '40s and early '50s was -- these was

4

these three things.

5

So the first thing was, there was a very

6

vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature

7

of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they

8

were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard

9

in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard

10

generally in the district courts.

11

question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add,

12

that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in

13

briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under

14

these exact same words.

15

the Portsmouth case.

16

This was the precise

That was the SG's briefing in

Okay?

But what "competent jurisdiction" in this

17

context was held to mean at that time was the direction

18

that general jurisdiction courts, and not only

19

specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case.

20

The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the

21

time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase,

22

later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State

23

court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of

24

Claims.

25

And that issue was resolved.
The second thing --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the court said

"general jurisdiction," right?

3

MR. BROOKS:

They -- they certainly did.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

"General jurisdiction,"

5

instead of saying "of competent jurisdiction" when

6

"competent" generally means -- is this -- the -- the

7

sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to

8

sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed

9

to the Court.

10

Does this Court have authority to proceed in

11

this category of cases?

12

MR. BROOKS:

Yes, Your Honor.

So the way we

13

think all these things work together is, first of all,

14

as I say, the entire phrase, "court of competent

15

jurisdiction," State or Federal, had been unanimously

16

held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction.

17

Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no

18

cases to the contrary at the time.

19

Right?

And the understanding of what "competent

20

jurisdiction" was adding was twofold.

21

from Congress's perspective at the time, I think it's

22

fair to say they weren't thinking about much, because

23

the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of

24

Federal housing policy having very little to do with

25

jurisdiction.

Alderson Reporting Company

First of all,

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

And we think what happened is they simply

2

borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to

3

confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.

4

There was no other reason to think they meant anything

5

different from that.

6

But we also know that less than two years

7

before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this

8

Court looked at the phrase "competent jurisdiction" on a

9

standalone basis and said that all it referred to at

10

that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.

11

That doesn't mean that's what "competent

12

jurisdiction" means always.

But what we think it means

13

is when coupled with the words "State" or "Federal," it

14

means personal jurisdiction courts of general

15

jurisdiction.

16

Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the

17

question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued

18

clauses like ours.

19

that your clerk has.

20

Fannie Mae.

21
22

We have the same count, Your Honor,
We have nine total, including

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We now have three

versions, but that's okay.

I'm going to go with nine.

MR. BROOKS:

early this morning, is 781.

5

jurisdiction" together with "State" or "Federal" exists

6

only nine times, but "competent jurisdiction" as a

7

generic matter occurs 781 times, that's the rule that we

8

urge on this Court today.

9

So if the phrase "competent

The rule is, when combined with the grant of

jurisdiction embodied in the word "Federal" under Red

jurisdiction holdings of other cases.

But there is a specific

19

statute that makes that crystal clear.

didn't it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it

6

Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about

7

Freddie Mac is severalfold.

So the first thing we know

8

is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative

9

history in both the House Report and the Senate Report

10

make crystal clear that Congress's intention was to

11

create an entity that had identical powers that would

12

develop in parallel and that would have no advantage

over Fannie Mae.

Now, the words were unquestionably

16

different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter

17

were different from the words in the Second Bank of the

18

United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same.

19

The reason the words were different at the

20

time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of

21

writing in a blank slate.

22

60 years of history, without the need to extricate a

23

legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization

scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

points.

2

So first of all, on the -- on the natural

3

reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of

4

"competent jurisdiction" standing alone is different

5

from the natural reading of "competent jurisdiction"

6

State or Federal.

7

that holds those words together, don't confer

8

jurisdiction.

9

And there is no case, I emphasize,

But now, on the question about what was --

10

you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there

11

is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer.

12

And that respect is if the colloquy related to the

13

statute that created Fannie Mae.

14

clearer.

That would make it

15

But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that

16

counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that

17

created Fannie Mae, and so it's not that much more

18

probative than if it had been the legislative history of

19

an utterly unrelated statute.

20

Okay?

In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress

21

authorized the creation of entirely different private

22

mortgage associations which never came into being.

23

sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was

24

that private capital would come into the market pursuant

25

to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and

2

Chicago, and New York, and would start creating

3

liquidity to solve the problem.

4

So in 1938, a new statute was passed.

That

5

was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,

6

the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost

7

his re-election campaign.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. BROOKS:

11

For this reason.

We -- we -- we can only assume,

or perhaps hope.

12

But in any case, 1938 was a different

13

statute.

14

wasn't even created in 1938.

15

for Fannie Mae that's being reviewed today was created

16

in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was

17

adopted, and six years after D'Oench, Duhme.

18

language adopted in 1948 was the D'Oench, Duhme

19

language.

20

The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that
The congressional charter

And the

So somebody has to prevail, either the

21

Supreme Court unanimously in D'Oench, Duhme, or the

22

failed Senator Bulkley.

23

most likely this Court in D'Oench, Duhme followed in Red

24

Cross.

25

We -- we think the answer is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

The -- the Federal

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

courts -- may be stepping back a bit.

2

of limited jurisdiction.

3

to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish

4

their right to be there.

5

There are courts

And to get into them you have

Now, I think you have to do more than win

6

51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction.

7

Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more

8

than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration

9

that we need to take into account.

10

MR. BROOKS:

So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,

11

there's no question that the courts are limited

12

jurisdiction courts, and we should look at

13

subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye.

14

Having said that, this fundamentally is a

15

case about statutory construction.

16

Congress mean to do in 1954.

17

about.

18

that under Article III --

19

It's about what did

That's really all it's

I don't think there's a serious question but

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there's so many ways

20

that you could -- if you want to make sure that this

21

entity gets into Federal court all the time, what

22

Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will

23

be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and

24

removal purposes.

25

Now, that is very clear.

Alderson Reporting Company

It means it can

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

come into Federal court to sue.

2

if it's sued in State court.

It means it can remove

3

This, compared to "court of competent

4

jurisdiction" -- which, as I go back to competent

5

jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the

6

Court, which consists of two things:

7

personal.

8
9

MR. BROOKS:

subject matter and

So, Your Honor, let me begin

where you ended, if I might, and just say that this

10

Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase

11

"competent jurisdiction" again, standing alone, okay,

12

has multiple different meanings depending on context.

13

In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this

14

Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter

15

jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal

16

jurisdiction citing cases.

17

In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.

18

Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before

19

our statute was decided, it said that in that context,

20

the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.

21

So I think the only way to harmonize all of

22

these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction

23

is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross

24

language/Osborn/D'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the

25

other things that "competent jurisdiction" normally

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

means:

personal jurisdiction, courts of general

2

jurisdiction, et cetera.

3

holds.

And that's what the case law

4

But the most --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's because this

6

Court's competence is general competence, which is

7

subject matter, and it's specific competence, which is

8

personal.

9

MR. BROOKS:

Correct.

That's exactly right.

10

And, again, because this is a case about Congress'

11

intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to

12

understand is when Congress borrowed this language that

13

had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration

14

for 20 years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its

15

verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that

16

language had held it was sufficient to confer

17

subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the

18

Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six

19

years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that

20

those words were no more restrictive than the phrase "in

21

any United States District Court."

22

on which Congress was weaving at the time.

23

That's the tapestry

Now, let me address, if I might just

24

briefly, the policy issue.

25

the history.

We talked about the text and

But counsel spent a few moments talking

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

about this privatization concept and how it would be

2

that what must have happened in the '50s was Congress

3

was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private

4

company and deprive it of special access to the Federal

5

courts.

6

The presumption behind that argument is

7

that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately

8

owned company to have special access, except we know

9

from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that

10

there are times when a privately owned company is

11

sufficiently important, it can have special access.

12

Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private

13

shareholders.

14

The

Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know

15

that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at

16

its inception with clear and undisputed access to the

17

Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of

18

course, because it was writing in a different era and

19

writing on a different slate without all the baggage

20

that Fannie Mae had gone through.

21

question that privately owned instrumentalities when

22

pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can

23

qualify under these circumstances.

But there's no

24

But the other problem with their theory if

25

it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

in its mechanism.

2

privatize Fannie Mae in 1954.

3

when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954

4

Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it

5

still had special access to the Federal courts under

6

1345.

7

The truth is this:

Congress did not

On the contrary, even

So if there had been a conscious legislative

8

judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at

9

that time, they surely would have had to do the work of

10

taking away its agency status.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It shouldn't matter to

12

the Federal court.

13

diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.

14

They can be there if there is

MR. BROOKS:

That's true, Your Honor.

That

15

exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised

16

specifically in Red Cross.

17

in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that

18

Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds.

19

And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not

20

being particularly relevant.

21

on lots of grounds all the time.

It was a point of discussion

22

And by the way --

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

the competence language.

25

or Federal.

Lots of companies remove

But Red Cross didn't have

It was just any court, State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

MR. BROOKS:

That's true.

But the point I

2

was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction

3

didn't have some negative implication for other sources,

4

and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful

5

evidence that that shouldn't matter.

6

Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and

7

suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued

8

in State or Federal court.

9

Freddie doesn't say competent jurisdiction.

10

It also says, Freddie --

But what else Freddie says is Freddie says

11

that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345

12

purposes.

13

statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the

14

limitations of 1442.

15

grounds for getting to Federal court.

16
17

It separately says Freddie shall have

So Freddie has four distinct

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why didn't they do

that for Fannie Mae?

18

MR. BROOKS:

Because we -- I mean, it's hard

19

to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of

20

the Framers of our charter.

21

language was written in the '30s and '40s.

22

written at a time when we were connected with multiple

23

other agencies.

24

Housing and Urban Development.

25

Ginnie Mae.

But the original charter
It was

We were part of the Department of
We comprised what became

And our language was an attempt to do

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this

2

big accretion of language over decades.

3

Freddie Mac didn't have that problem.

So

4

Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting

5

from scratch.

6

I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan's

7

colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would

8

happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute.

9

And I'm trying to imagine what would happen to the poor

10

Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen.

11

We -- we'd like to change Fannie Mae's language.

12

want to add this competent jurisdiction language.

13

We

Now, that's only been looked at three times

14

before, and all of those cases said that confers

15

jurisdiction.

16

perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a

17

way of removing jurisdiction.

But we think that was just dicta or

18

That doesn't sound plausible any more in

19

this case than it did in the prior case to me, given

20

what the case law backdrop was of the time.

21

Now, if I might, I'd like to say one point

22

about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you

23

know, we are sister companies.

24

has different language.

25

thing for our side?

Obviously, Freddie Mac

The question is, is this a good

Is it a bad thing for our side?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

Our view basically is Congress said what it

2

meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate.

It said

3

that companies were supposed to be parallel.

They were

4

supposed to have no advantages over each other and have

5

all the same powers.

6

The question for this Court is:

Why would

7

Congress -- although it used a different language across

8

multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac

9

to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same

10

securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC

11

exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,

12

but have different Federal court litigating powers?

13

There's no answer to that.

14

And all we know is that in terms of the

15

Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what

16

we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only

17

much, much bigger.

18

imagine that a $3 trillion dollar company, the largest

19

company in the United States by assets, creating housing

20

across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been

21

intended not to be protected by Federal court

22

jurisdiction.

23

So it doesn't make a lot of sense to

JUSTICE BREYER:

Did you look it up?

I

24

mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this

25

language really came from?

I mean, somebody wrote it.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

It didn't just have computers write it.

2

is a human being who wrote it.

3

MR. BROOKS:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

from?

Yeah.

Who did he work for?

But who?

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. BROOKS:

Where did he come

He was fired.

He was fired.

It's possible it was a former

staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope
not.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, "State or Federal."

did this.

22
23

MR. BROOKS:

We

I just want to know who

know.
Your Honor, here's what we do know:

the language was not de novo in 1954.

had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress

had no indication it could have meant anything else.

5

know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the

6

Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase,

7

"competent jurisdiction," State or Federal, conferred

8

jurisdiction.

9

That's what we know.

That's where the

And we know that that language

Here's what else we know:

We

We know that in

10

briefing before this Court in the '80s, looking at this

11

exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing

12

Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition

13

to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth

14

Redevelopment case.

15

the Solicitor General's office said that phrase creates

16

jurisdiction in the district courts.

17

we know.

18

And in that brief citing Ferguson,

Okay?

That's what

That has always been the understanding.
And if we didn't have that history and we

19

didn't have that case law, we might write it differently

20

on a blank slate.

21

and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we

22

know what it means.

23

But writing 200 years after Osborn

The disruption that would be created in the

24

markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower

25

courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

the same result, at least three in the courts of

2

appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different

3

powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there is a

5

reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests

6

there was a reason for treating them differently, which

7

is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of

8

Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that

9

Fannie's board, two-thirds of it does not.

10

MR. BROOKS:

Right.

But the Fannie board,

11

unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the

12

President of the United States until conservatorship in

13

2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury

14

access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC

15

registration exemptions.

16

no material policy different between these two agencies,

17

and again, we have the legislative history that shows an

18

intent to treat these the same.

19

I mean, Your Honor, there is

I will say that since 1974, every GSE

20

statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously

21

imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and

22

the Freddie Mac charter.

23

Congress has never treated one differently, not in the

24

'70s and not today.

25

they would have wanted these treated differently.

So since Freddie was created,

So there's no plausible reason why

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1
2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you know why they

have that different structure on the board of directors?

3

MR. BROOKS:

Well, again, Your Honor, and

4

it's interesting, I've actually personally spoken to

5

some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late

6

'60s, okay?

7

because Fannie was, in '68, being extricated from its

8

Federal agency role.

9

They were all former government officials,

Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper.

10

Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of

11

1970 would have wanted it.

12

Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be

13

torn apart from Ginnie Mae.

14

board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of

15

Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD

16

Undersecretary.

It consisted of a former general

17

counsel of HUD.

They were all Federal officials at that

18

time, and it took multiple years before they could be

19

extricated.

20

it different.

21

Fannie Mae wasn't.

Fannie

That's why the original

There is just a history here, which makes

But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the

22

largest participant in the largest market in the U.S.

23

economy.

24

and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because

25

the language of the '50s and a complicated history

Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

differed a little bit from the language of the '70s,

2

would be a significant policy shift that we would argue

3

isn't justified by either history or policy or text.

4

If there are no further questions, thank

5

you.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

Thank you, counsel.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Just a couple of points.

12

First, Justice Breyer wanted to know:

What

13

do you do when the language points one way and the cases

14

seem to point another?

15

cases seem to point another," but my direct answer is:

16

This Court has never gone wrong by going with the

17

language, and in those previous cases, what the Court

18

was trying to do in each case was go with the language,

19

right down to Red Cross where the operative principle

20

was:

21

Court addressed it?

22

I would -- I'd dispute the "the

What did this very language mean last time this

Justice Breyer, you also asked:

Which is

23

simpler for lawyers?

Now -- now, Fannie doesn't dispute

24

that our reading is a natural reading of the language.

25

Fannie doesn't even dispute that it's the most natural

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

reading.

2

this proposition that it might actually mean other

3

things, but I still don't know what Fannie thinks it

4

means.

5

Instead, its entire argument revolves around

Fannie says it could mean personal

6

jurisdiction.

It could mean -- it could mean venue.

7

could mean general jurisdiction.

8

words into the statute, and it just doesn't parse.

9

the bottom line is you need to commit to what that

Plug each of those

10

meaning is, and this Court can't go wrong by

11

interpreting those words to mean what this Court has

12

said of competent jurisdiction.

13
14

JUSTICE KAGAN:
personal jurisdiction.

15

It

But

Well, suppose it means

Why doesn't it parse?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Okay.

So now the statute

16

says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has

17

personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or

18

Federal.

19

Well, the Federal Court of Claims has

20

personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a

21

grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is

22

that this now turns into a grant of Federal

23

subject-matter jurisdiction.

24

jurisdiction to Fannie.

25

It's not a grant of

So what about the court of appeals cases

that Mr. Brooks has addressed?

2

interpret the phrase of "competent jurisdiction," and

3

they were not about Federal jurisdiction.

understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that

5

there was Federal jurisdiction.

whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district

court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal

court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.

11

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, I can't

12

explain the position that the government has taken, but

13

the government has said that those were also kind of

14

drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply

15

did not involve the question of what is the source of

Federal jurisdiction.
