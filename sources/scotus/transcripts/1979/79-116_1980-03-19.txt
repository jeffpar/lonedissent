PRO CEE D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Company.
Mr. Green» you may proceed whenever you are

ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. GREEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS GREEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the. Court:
Halley I. Thomas, a resident of the District of
Columbia since 19^3» was hired in 1970 as a heavy laborer
by the Washington Gas Light Company in their employment
office in Washington, D. C.

Although Mr. Thomas occasion­

ally worked in the neighboring jurisdictions of Virginia
and Maryland, approximately 60 percent of hi» duties were
performed in the District of Columbia.

For his endeavor»,

Mr. Thomas received a paycheck drawn upon a District of
Columbia bank.

On January 22, 1971, Mr. Thomas was break­

ing concrete with an air hammer in Arlington, Virginia,
when he sustained a disabling injury to his back.

Since

that date. Hr. Thomas has been unable to return to his
occupation.
Prior to his being represented by counsel, Mr.
Thomas, while still hospitalized, signed a Virginia agree­
ment for temporary total disability benefits under the

4
Virginia Workmen’s Compensation Act.

Mr. Thomas received

the Virginia benefits until the maximum amount payable
under Virginia law.

Mr. Thomas is currently without any

disability compensation and medical coverage.

Mr. Thomas

pursued permanent and total disability benefits in the
District of Columbia and received an award which has never
been honored.
The Court is today presented with two independent
statutory schemes, each of which has as its purpose the
compensation of injured workers*

The statutes concerned

are those of Virginia and the District of Columbia.

The

compensation statutes in both of these jurisdictions create
administrative remedies.

The respective administrative

fora do not look north or south or east or west to deter­
mine whether a given person is entitled to compensation
in that forum.
QUESTION:

Let me back up a little bit, Mr..

Green.
MR. GREEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr* Chief Justice»
In Virginia, he received compensation

for total but not permanent disability, Is that right?
MR. GREEN:
QUESTION:
MR. GREEN:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
Totally but not permanent*
That is correct.
The claim now is that he is permanently

:?

disabled.
MR. GREEN:

That is correct.

That claim was

presented to the District of Columbia.
QUESTION:

Is his claim foreclosed in Virginia

for permanent disability?

In other words, has he no re­

sidual rights when it developed that his temporary dis­
ability was apparently a permanent disability?
MR. GREEN:

Your Honor, the question of permanent

and total disability was never resolved, in the Commonwealth
of Virginia.

That claim —

QUESTION:
MR. GREEN:

Why not?
Because the benefits in the District

of Columbia after Mr. Thomas obtained counsel were more
generous to Mr. Thomas, and a claim was initiated in the
District of Columbia for permanent and total disability
benefits.
QUESTION:

I perhaps miaunderstood this situation,

but I thought the fact was that he has now been paid all
that he could be paid under the Virginia Workmen's Compen­
sation Act for — even for total permanent disability.
MR. GREEN:

Mr. Justice Stewart, you do not

misunderstand what he has been paid.

He has been paid

the extent of the Virginia award as it was then enacted
i

in 1971.

QUESTION:

Even if one concedes that he was

totally and permanently disabled?
MR„ GREEN:
QUESTION:
MR. GREEN:

That Is correct3 Mr. Justice.
That Is what I thought.
He has been paid that amount, the

point being that they continue to pay the Virginia award
even after the District of Columbia had granted Thomas'
claim for permanent and total disability: an award was
entered9 they never paid the award.
QUESTION:

I am having a little difficulty

reconciling your two answers just on the factual situation.
MR. GREEN:
QUESTION:

Let me see if I can —
That is why I put the question, be­

cause I was confused as to the reality.

Could he have got

an award for total and permanent in Virginia if he had
ignored the District of Columbia entirely?
MR. GREEN:

And my answer to your question, Mr-.

Chief Justice, would have been he could have pursued such
a remedy In Virginia.

The Virginia statutory scheme left

open to Thomas a claim for additional relief beyond
temporary total disability.

He elected not to pursue the

permanent total disability claim in Virginia and pursued
that claim In the District of Columbia to a judgment which
has never been honored.

The Virginia award continued to

be paid until it ran out in the summer of 1978, July of
1978.

7
QUESTION;

And what would it have been open to

him to pursue in Virginia after his initial award?
MR. GREEN:

He would have been able in Virginia

to pursue under a separate statutory policy permanent dis­
ability , that is permanent and total disability, although
it is not
captioned
as such in Virginia* under their
*
—z
statute he could have —
QUESTION:

Well, what did he get an award for?

MR. GREEN:

He received an award, a voluntary

award for temporary total disability.
QUESTION:
MR. GREEN:
QUESTION:

Temporary total.
Yes.
So he could have pursued another award

for permanent in Virginia?
MR. GREEN:

It would be our position that he

could have, Mr. Justice White, yes.
QUESTION:

But would he have obtained a single

dime more than he had. already obtained?
MR. GREEN:

Mr. Justice Blackraun, he would not

bays obtained any more money because the Virginia statute
at that time —
QUESTION:

Precisely, therefore why go to

Virginia?
MR. GREEN:

That is why he cam® to D.C. „ sir,

that was the election and he made It and name to the

3
District of Columbia and brought his action and received
the award which has not been honored.
QUESTION:

It seems to me we are making a lot of

fuss over nothing here.

You went to the District of

Columbia because there was more money available.

He had

wrung Virginia dry of all its funds under the statute.
MR. GREEN:
QUESTION:

Not just the money —
Whether It is total or whether it Is

permanent.
MR. GREEN:

Correct, Mr, Justice Blackman, not

just the money but also the medical benefits.

In Virginia,

the statutory scheme in 1971 allowed for a termination of
medical care to an Injured worker when the money ran out.
The District of Columbia has no such statutory policy.
Under section 907 of Title 33 of the U.S. Code, the nan
could obtain his benefits for medical care in the District
of Columbia.as long as he was still disabled from that
industrial accident.
The petitioner would state that you do not have
to reach a question of full faith and credit in order to
determine this case a because the controversy involved
does not bring the full faith and credit clause of the
Constitution to bear on these issues.

What it does do is

it suggests that this Courtf s holding in McCartin is
correct3 that the Virginia statute is not so exclusive as

9
to preclude Thomas* claim in the District of Columbia.
QUESTION:

What do you consider to be the holding

as you described it in MeCartin?
MR. GREEN:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I consider

the holding to be that in a statutory scheme where a state
allows for recovery by aa injured worker having only
limited demands prior common law right to sue his employer
through that statutory scheme, he can bring an addition&l
aetlon in any state or any forum in which ha desires to
do so, allowing certain constitutional contacts that
would give him the right to bring that claim.
QUESTION:

Isn’t a good deal of what you have

Just said dicta rather than a holding?
MR. GREEN:

1 don’t believe that it is.

I be­

lieve that the- Court repeated twice in McCartin, after
discussing the- reservation of the contractual right that
they found that the Illinois statute or a statutory scheme
similar to Illinois, like those* we would allow those;
statutory schemes to not be preclusive and to not be ex­
clusive so that the man cannot bring additional claim for
benefits.
QUESTION:

But a court can write a ten-page

opinion and say we hold that in every paragraph and that
still doesn’t make each paragraph a holding.
MR. GREEN: . I would agree with that, but I would

10
urge that it is not dicta in MeCartin5 that it is the rule
of MeCartin and has been so interpreted.

Since this Court

came with the MeCartin decision* the proginy of MeCartin
are throughout this country ands as we have cited on
brief* they are numerous»

They understand the Court to

have said in that decision that unless a statutory scheme
is exclusive* the man can bring an additional claim for
relief in any forum in which he has a right to bring such
a claimo

The aggregate of that claim is a set amount.

cannot be more generous than the most generous forumo
That is what we would urge this Court to con­
sider, that your announcement in HcCartin controls this
case, not Magnolia»

And because it does* the Virginia

exclusive remedy provision is only exclusive as to a
common law right to sue your employer and is exclusive
for no other purpose»

And because it is not,, a man has

a right to bring a claim in multiple jurisdictions.
I would reserve the remainder of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Horowitz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOROWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to speak briefly about the point
raised by Mr. Justice Blackman about going back to

It

11
Virginia for a permanent disability award.

As Mr, Justice

Blackman pointed out, the petitioner was not entitled, to
any further benefits under the Virginia statute*

It would

just have been a question of whether they were called
temporary or permanente

But even under permanent dis­

ability , his benefits would have run out.
benefits that are not paid by Virginia.

These are
They are paid by

the employers the respondent in this case.
QUESTIO?!:

So the fact is that he has gotten

all that he could possibly get under the Virginia system
and all that somebody who didn’t have aver a potential
choice of going Into another jurisdiction system,all that
such a person could possibly get, MR. HOROWITZ:

That’s correct.
/

QUESTION:

Me has received, hasn’t he?

MR.xHOROWITZ:

Correct.

Virginia provides

fetver benefits than the District of Columbia.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. HOROWITZ:

Had he gone to the District of

Columbia initially *—
QUESTION:

And if he had a Virginia employer

end been Injured in Virginia and had no connection with
any other jurisdiction and had been totally .and perman­
ently disabled, this is all he could ever get under the
Virginia system, isn’t that correct?

12
MR. HOROWITZ:

That's right, under the statute

as it was written at the time.
QUESTION:

As it was then written.

MR. HOROWITZ:

That's correct.

Now, the ques­

tion in this case is simply whether as a consequence of
a Virginia Workmen's Compensation award the full faith
and credit clause bars the District of Columbia from
making an award to petitioner under its own worker's
e oispens at i on statute.
Now, we believe that this Court has already
answered the constitutional question presented here in
the MeCartin case, and that that decision compels reversal
in this case.
MeCartin held two things:

First, it held that

a worker's compensation award in one state was not neces­
sarily preclusive of a worker's compensation award in a
second state that supplemented the first award. but that
the preclusive effect depended upon the intent of the
first state in granting its award.
QUESTION:

That is wholly at odds with accepted

full faith and credit doctrine, isn't it?
MR, HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

No, I don't believe it is.

It is not the intent, It is what

effect the horns state would give that judgment —MR. HOROWITZ:

That's correct.

13
QUESTION:

-- and the foreign state must give

the same effect,
MR, HOROWITZ:

That * a correct, but it does not

have to give any greater effect.

Virginia did not intend

t-o —
QUESTION:

It has nothing to do with — you

wouldn't concede that the statement of the Court in
MeCartIn was a little bit at odds with normally accepted
full faith and credit?
MR. HOROWITZ:

I don't believe so.

If I under­

stand what is troubling you, Mr. Justice Stewart, it is
the question of whether we look at the preclusive effect
of the Virginia award in Virginia or the preclusive effect
of the Virginia award in the District of Columbia.

Is

that accurate?
The District of- Columbia only has to give the
Virginia award the preclusive effect that Virginia would
give it,

Virginia —
QUESTION:

It only has to give it that and

under full faith and credit It must give it that,
MR. HOROWITZ:

That’s quit© correct.

Mow, in

this case there is a question of whether the Virginia
award is intended by Virginia to preclude awards under
the District of Columbia statute.
QUESTION:

Under ordinary full faith and credit

doctrine * it is not that the law of Virginia says we want
to siake very clear that this must be given effect in other
Jurisdictions,

That has nothing to do with full faith and

credit,
MR, HOROWITZ:

I agree„ but the question is what

does the Virginia award mean, in Virginia.
QUESTION:

Precisely.

MR, HOROWITZ:

But in Virginia* the Virginia

courts would not hear a claim under the District of
Columbia statute3 so there is

no

way to tell, there is not

going to be any case law to tell —
QUESTION:

Virginia courts would hear a petition

for a permanent disability award.

It may not give- him any

more money * but they would hear the case, we fere just
told.
MR, HOROWITZ:

Well9 I think for the purposes of

this case we can treat it as if he had gotten his award
in Virginia and it had been called a permanent disability
award.
QUESTION:

I would think you would want to treat

it that way, but the fact is he was given a temporary per­
manent disability award and Virginia did not bar his seek­
ing a permanent disability award.
MR, HOROWITZ:

Well* suppose he had gone to

Virginia and gotten a permanent disability award —

15
QUESTION:

Weil* the Fourth Circuit certainly

knows more about Virginia law than we do.
MR, H0R0WIT3:

Well* first of all, on the ques­

tion of Virginia law, there is a dispute.

The Fourth

Circuit did not hold that under McCartin the Virginia
statute possessed the unmistakable language referred to
in McCartin and that it thereby barred second awards»
What we contend is that the Fourth Circuit misinterpreted
McCartin,

The Fourth Circuit’s opinion in Pettus does not

deal with McCartin in much detail but simply says that
McCartin had no effect whatsoever on Magnolia.
QUESTION: And for what it is worthP the Fourth
Circuit was divided in Pettus.
MR, HOROWITZ:
was divided on Pettus.

That's true, the Fourth Circuit

Moreover, another panel of the

Fourth Circuit has stated in a case that is distinguishable
on its facts that the latent of the Virginia statute is
not to preclude & District of Columbia award.

Moreover,

the D.C. Circuit has also held that the Virginia statute
does not have that effect, explicitly rejecting the de­
cision In Pettus.
QUESTION:

If we have to choose between the

Fourth Circuit's interpretation of Virginia law and the
D*C. Circuit’s interpretation of Virginia law, ordinarily
we would defer to the Fourth Circuit rather than the D.C.

16
Circuit, wouldn’t we?
MR. HOROWITZ:

I don’t think the Court h&3 to

defer to the Fourth Circuit because the Court specified in
McCartin what the rule of construction was for interpret­
ing these worker’s compensation statutes when they don’t
specifically address the question of an award under
another state’s statute, and that rule of construction is
that the stata must specify by unmistakable language that
it intends to bar such an award.
Now, the Fourth Circuit did not consider that.
The Fourth Circuit did not deal with McCartin's injunction
i

on. that point.

The Fourth Circuit simply said that

McCartin has no application here.
QUESTION:

But we have three judges sitting

down in Richmond who are presumably familiar with the
cases they are talking about, they talk about McCartin
and they say McCartin does not control this case.
MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

Right, and I think •—

They may be wrong, but :Lf you are

saying that they misinterpreted Virginia law, I think you
are leading on a rather weak reed.
MR. HOROWITZ:

I am saying that they misinter­

preted McCartin.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be another question,

but they didn’t understand what McCartin told them they

17
had to find in order to do what they did.
MR. HOROWITZ:

That’s right, and so they did not

interpret —* they made no attempt to interpret the Virginia
statute in line as prescribed by this Court in MsCartinu
So I don’t think that the decision in Pettus as far as
the interpretation of Virginia law is entitled to such
deference by this Court*
QUESTION:
mind here.

Mr. Horowita, something slipped my

Why did this case•go to the Fourth Circuit

rather than the District of Columbia courts?
fH

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, there is a provision, in

the Longshoremen’s Act that appeal should be to the
circuit where the injury occurred,

Thera Is some dispute:

over exactly what that means, whether it means the
District of Columbia Circuit or to interpret it literally,
where the injury occurred, but that was not disputed in
this ease.
Again, MeCartin sets out a rule of construction
that the Virginia statute must state in unmistakable
language that it intends to preclude the District of
Columbia award.

How, the Virginia statute here contains

no unmistakable language.

Indeed, it is very similar to

the statute that was construed by this Court in MsCartin,
the Illinois statute.
Moreover, to the extent that the Virginia

18
statute gives us any suggestion at all about its views on
supplemental awards , we understand that Virginia permits
supplemental awards in its own courts.

That is, if the

petitioner her© had gone to the District of Columbia
first and gotten an award that was less than what he was
entitled to in Virginia, it is clear from the Virginia
statute that he could have gone to Virginia and supplemented
that award up to the benefits that Virginia allows under
its statute.
So what respondent is asking for is an extremely
arrogant interpretation of the Virginia statute and that
is that Virginia expects other states to honor the limi­
tations that Virginia puts on its awards, but Virginia
will not honor such limitations by other states, and that
Virginia expects other.states to permit Virginia to give
supplemental awards, yet Virginia will not permit .other
states to give their supplemental awards.
QUESTION:

What you are saying by that l's that

there is no interest of the Commonwealth of Virginia that
is really implicated here.
MR. H0H0WIT2:'

Well, to the extent that there

is an interest — it is conceivable that Virginia might
have decided that it was better not to have supplemental
awards,that they prefer the limitations, but to the extent
that they have expressed themselves on that, they have

19
shown that their interest is in providing supplemental
awardss that is that the stronger interest is to compen­
sate the injured employees.
QUESTION:

But if Virginia is not concerned

about awards elsewhere* one would think that it isn't con­
cerned about its own allocation of awards.
MR. HOROWITZ:

That’s correct, that it just

would not want to restrict it.
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

Does Virginia have any economic in­

terest or any other kind of interest in being concerned
about how much money someone else pays out?
MR. HOROWITZ:
economic interest.

It certainly has no direct

To the extent that —
t

QUESTION:

Whatever some other state — what­

ever is achieved in soma other state relieves any tension
or pressure for Virginia to expand its awards, is. that
hot so?
MR. HOROWITZ:

That's correct, In a case where

there is jurisdiction of both states.
QUESTION: But that 90 percent or nor© of the
,
’
.}
industrial accidents in Virginia, an injured person ■
;.

wouldn't have a choice of two jurisdictions.

i

Isn’t that

your quess?
MR. HOROWITZ:

That's correct.

How, to the

extent that Virginia «sight have an interest and somehow

20
having a limitation where there is jurisdiction in two
states, which Is what the respondent io suggesting, that
Is an interest that they cannot vindicate unless the in­
jured employee makes a Mistake in the first instance and
goes to Virginia.

I mean

there is no dispute in this

case that petitioner could have gone directly to the
District of Columbia and gotten all the benefits that he
is entitled to under the District of Columbia act.
QUESTION:

Because he was a resident or —

MR. HOROWITZ:

Because he was a resident and

because the respondent :1s an employer in the District of
Columbia,

It is the Washington Gas Light Company.
QUESTION:

But in fact h© went to Virginia.

HR, HOROWITZ2
to Virginia.

ThatTs right, in fact he want

As It happened, he signed a. memorandum

agreement with respondent after two weeks anti that award
was just approved by the Virginia Industrial Commission
and it then takes on the fore© of an award in Virginia,
He didn’t — It is true that he went to Virginia.

The

way the worker's compensation system works, it is not the
same kind of choice that a litigant makes when he chooses;
to go to a particular court,
QUESTION:

But no one forced him to sign the

award, did they?
MR. HOROWITZ:

There is no evidence that he was;

21
forced to sign the award.

It is certainly probable that

he had no idea, that he had any rights under the District
of Columbia statute at that time.
QUESTION:

Is the issue here constitutional or

not?
MR» HOROWITZ;

Well, we think the constitutional

issue has bean settled by Me. Cart in if this Court —
QUESTION:

So there is on®?

MR, HOROWITZ;

If the Court is going to recon­

sider KeCartin.
QUESTION:

Was there s, statutory issue in the

case?
MR. HOROWITZ;
QUESTION:

In this case?

Yes»

MR» HOROWITZ:

Well, there is always a statutory

issue as to whether the Virginia statute intends to pre­
clude a D,e» award.
QUESTION;

Well, what about the Longshoremen’s

Act?
MR. HOROWITZ:

I'm afraid I don’t understand the

question.

QUESTION:

Hon about the claim that the D.C„

law didn’t apply because it is the Longshoremen’s Act and
the Longshoremen *s Act does not permit awards where a
state has awarded?
MR. HOROWITZ:

That was conceded, at the adminis­

trative hearing* that there was no contention that the
District of Columbia act would not have applied if it
were not for the Virginia award.
QUESTION:

Is there any possibility here that

if a total and permanent evard were made in the District

\

i

of Columbia» Virginia could recover from what it has paid
out?
MR. HOROWITZ;

Well» all the monies that are

paid out are paid out by the employer.

The state is not

the employer.
QUESTION:

Well» I meant to say the employer.

MR. HOROWITZ:

Yes» the District of Columbia

award would give credit for the monies paid out in Virginia.
There is no issue of double recovery here.

The employee

is only receiving what he would have gotten had he gone
to the District of Columbia in the first place.

QUESTIOHr

Let's assume that an Issue had been

raised that no longshoremen's style recovery may be had
because the state has already entered an award, and you
read something out of the Longshoremen's Act to that
effect.

Suppose the Court of Appeals, it had been pre­

sented to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals
said that Is absolutely right, the District of Columbia
award is barred because Virginia has made an award*
Would that have been a correct ruling?

Would that have been a correct ruling

or not?
MR. HOROWITZ:

No, under* the Longshoremen’s

Act. no, that is not s correct ruling.
QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it have been?

Because the Longshoremen’8 Act

does not restrict its recoveries to cases that are not
covered under other state laws, and that contention of
respondents is incorrect,

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, the Court might want to

QUESTION:

Well, you told me they rejected it.

MR. HOROWITZ:

I donTt know if they rejected it.

They didn’t consider it apparently.
QUESTION:

Certainly this Court has never de­

cided It.
MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

No, this Court has not decided it.

Mr. Horowitz, before you sit down,

you said there was a constitutional question.

What pro­

vision of the Constitution is involved?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, there was a question prior

to McCartin as to whether the full faith and credit clause

26
would bar this award simply because an award was made In
Virginia and Virginia has a general exclusivity provision
that makes that award exclusive.
QUESTION:

Is the District of Columbia a state

within the meaning of the full faith and credit clause?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I think for these purposes

it would be.
QUESTION:

Has that ever been held?

I was Just

wondering if it is a statutory question rather than a
cons 11 tut tonal q ues t i on. „
QUESTION:

It is a statutory question identical

to ~
MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, the full faith and credit

clause ties both the Constitution implementing statute
to the full faith and credit clause, and they are prac­
tically coextensive®
QUESTION:

But if it is not a constitutional

question, we may not have the problem Mr. Justice White
suggests of needing to address some other statutory
question before this statutory question.
QUESTION:

It Is like a 1983 case, a purely

statutory claim but reads right on the Constitution.
QUESTION:

That*s right, but this one does not-

read, on the Constitution and that is why you needed the
statute.

27
ME, HOROWITZ:

Me 13., the main issue in this case

is also simply a statutory question and that is what -doea
the Virginia statute say®

It is only if the Court is going

to reconsider MeCartin that it has to worry about the con­
stitutional question®
’

■- <*
■

QUESTION:

•

■

But you also suggest in your'brief

that we might reconsider both Magnolia and MeC&rtln to the
extent of being persuaded that the full faith and credit
clausa of the Constitution and its supplementary statute
have nothing to do with workmen's compensation awards or
that workmen's compensation awards are an exception®.
MR, HOROWITZ:

Well, I certainly don't think

the Court has to reconsider Magnolia in this case®
Whether it is possible in another case that —
QUESTION:

You suggest it on page 26 of your

brief®
MR, HOROWITZ:

Well, wo suggested that other

— we ware trying to have the Court not step back from the
MeCartln rationale and in support of that we have noted
that some commentators have .suggested that even Magnolia
was wrong and that is not really an issue in this case.
QUESTION:

Exactly, and that the full faith and

credit clause of the Constitution or its equivalent
statute are simply inapplicable to workmen's compensation
actions

28
MR. HOROWITZ:

Because of the nature of work­

men* s compensation actions —
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR2 HOROWITZ:

— that the state never considers

the —
QUESTION:

And that would require reexamination

of both Magnolia and MeCartin2 at least as to their under­
lying premises.
MR. HOROWITZ:

Yes3 if you were to reach that

argument; but there is no need to do so.
QUESTION:

Then why did you put It in your

brief?
MR* HOROWITZ:

Because I thought it was sup­

portive of the notion that MeCartin was correct*
MeCartin sets up a rule of construction that permits the
Magnolia resu.lt only when the .state has made it quite
f
it quite explicit *
QUESTION:

Which is quite contrarys, as I sug­

gested at the outset in my question, from ordinarily
accepted doctrine under the full faith and credit clause,.
MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

Except that —

It is the duty of a foreign juris­

diction to give precisely the same effect as the local
jurisdiction would give to that judgment.
MR. HOROWITZ:

That’s right, and so the

29

question of *»~
QUESTION:

Regardless of wh&t the legislature

might have said.
MR. HOROWITZ:

tod so the question is whether

the Virginia award would preclude the D.C. award.
QUESTION:

That’s the question.

MR. HOROWITZ:

And because Virginia never con­

siders D.C. awards, you can’t tell that from what happens
in Virginia.
QUESTION:

May I ask a question.

I have before

me section 65»1-^0 of the Virginia Code and I will read
this language and then ask you a question.

I have it at

page 4a I think of respondents' brief, in the appendis
in th® back of the brief:

"The rights and remedies herein

granted to an employee...shall exclude all other rights
and remedies of such employee...at common law or other­
wise. .. ”
Now, you rely on the MeCartin ease as holding
that a state statute must explicitly exclude all other
remedies.

What language would you suggest to meet your

own standard beyond what Is presently in the Virginia law?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, the provision that is in

the Virginia law is practically identical to th© provision
that was in the Illinois law that was considered In
MeCartin

30
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth

Circuit said, if I recall. In Petiuss that it was practic­
ally identical with the statute before the Court in
Magnolia.
MR* HOROWITZ:

That * s correct , although the

Magnolia case had the extra feature which the Court
specifically relied on* that the state of Texas did not
permit its own courts to give supplemental awards» whereas
here Virginia does permit its courts to give supplemental
awards.
QUESTION:

You rely solely on that distinction?

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I think that is what was

at the bottom of the Magnolia finding, that Taxas — in
Magnolia, the Court did net specifically on this language;
but they found that Texas did not permit its awards —
did not permit another state to' give supplemental awards.
QUESTION:

Putting that aoide, could a state

statute be any sore explicit than 65.1-40?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Yes, it could.

We cited the

Nevada statute in our brief which is quite explicit.

It

says —
QUESTION:

What would you suggest in summary

QUESTION:

Well, the Nevada statute is unique.

as- to •—

isn*t it?

31
MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION;

Yeas it is unique»

Among the fifty states.

MR. HOROWITZ:

It is unique because states have

no interest in restricting supplemental awards in other
states9 mid some of the state haven’t done that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Horowitz* despite the language

that Justice Powell mentioned to you* you just answered
him that after this temporary permanent disability award
in Virginia, he could have gone bade and got a permanent
disability award.

That is what you just said.

MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

In Virginia.

But it wouldn't give him any more

money is your —

QUESTION:

But that language

that Justice

Powell

read to you wouldn't bar his again proceeding in the —
MR. HOROWITZ:

No, because that was under the

worker *v, compensation statute.

What this language does

is tar other remedies other than worker's compensation,
and the question is does that bar other remedies other
than the Virginia worker's compensation or does it not
bar remedies under another state’s workers compensation.
QUESTION:

It- bars all other remedies at common

law or otherwise.
MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

That's right.

That is pretty broad language.

32
MR, HOROWITZ:

That is what it states.

Now, I

would point out that this language bars other remedies
even before there is an award.

What this does is it forces

the employe® to go within the worker’s compensation system.
He can’t sue in tort.

He can’t bring any other remedy.

It really has nothing to do with the effect of the Virginia
award,
Mow, it is not intendedbecause it is clear
that Virginia would not have the power to prevent the
employee from going to D.C, initially and getting an award,
yet theoretically this language would also prevent that.
So 1 do think It is clear that this language is not
specifically aimed, at an award under another state’s
statute and that is what MeCartin —
QUESTION:

When you talk about an award, you

are talking about something that is ultimately paid for
by a tax on his employer, are you not?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, In this case It is paid

directly by his employer.
QUESTION:

Could the worker go to Nevada, for

instance, and get an award?
MR. HOROWITZ:
under the Neva1

No, there would be no jurisdiction

statute.

QUESTION:

Mr, Horowitz, you may have answered

this, but I want to be sure.

As X read your brief, you

33
are not particularly eager to have Magnolia overruled.
MR. HOROWITZi
QUESTION:

You think you can live with it.

MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

No.

Yes.

Yet the commentators in the academic

world think there is a bit of tension between Magnolia
and MeCartin.
MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

Yes. that*3 true.

Do you agree with that?

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well* there is some tension» they

are not satisfied as a theoretical conflicts of law
problem.

They have soma of the difficulty that Mr.

Justice Stewart has, and that is that it should not make
that much of a difference what Virginia says about the
extraterritorial —
QUESTION:

There was a change in the Chief'

Justice and the; later case was unanimous with only one
Justice concurring in the result.

The other one was a

very bare majority and a tenuous one at that.
SCR. HOROWITZ:

The MeCartin case severely

limited Magnolia and the Magnolia case can still come up,
it can still come up in Nevada, but the fact is there is
no policy for a state to have such a statute so It is un­
likely that this Court will ever be faced with the need
to overrule Magnolia or with that question.

Thank you MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Baldwin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN JEFFREY BALDWIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BALDWIN:

Nr. Chief Justice, and if it

please the Court:
The court below could have and should have dis­
missed this case on the non-constitutional grounds that
the District of Columbia'did not have jurisdiction in
this case and Independent of that the claim was untimely
filed.

Me have learned that Nr. Thomas was employed
by the gas company out of our Springfield, Virginia
offices.

He ms

In February, the parties executed a

memorandum agreement, they submitted it to the Virginia
Industrial Commission.

A month and a half later the

commission comas down with an award.

Two years later he

retains counsol and three and a half years later a claim
is made in the District of Columbia.
In regard to jurisdiction, in 1928, Congress
incorporated the Federal Longshoremen*s Act in tote as
the District of Columbia Workmen's Compensation Act.
act provides coverage for jurisdiction for injuries on
navigable waters and if compensation cannot be validly

The

had In a state.
Another provision provides that coverage is
available irrespective of the place of injury.

This pro­

vision can be road and harmonized with the federal cover­
age to read that coverage is afforded irrespective of the
place of injury and if compensation cannot validly be had
in the state.
Thomas was injured in Virginia, he received
and validly resolved compensation from Virginia*

Cqngres

sloftal hearings tell us that the D,C. act was to fill a
void.

There was no recovery for D.C. employees working

.for D.C. employers who were Injured on the Job In: the
District of Columbia.

If they were injured outside .the

District of Columbia, they were covered by state .compen­
sation laws.
Congress filled this void with a mutually Ex­
clusive federal act.

It was a very restrictive act md

it clearly intended to give the employees of.* the District
of Columbia one remedy, not as suggested by our opponents
two remedies.
In regard to tisseiinesB —
QUESTION:’ That isn’t the usual rule under the
Longshoremen’s Act though. Is it?
MR. BALDWIN:

lour Honor, in 1928 the Longshore

monks Act came in after a rather hard line of eases, the

Jensen case and then back up to 19^2 where this Court,
speaking through Justice Black, described those early
cases as employees being caught in a twilight zone, that
is pursuing a state remedy and then being unable to re­
cover under a one-year statute*
Also in this time era the cases were thought
to be atari time national versus Maritime local.
QUESTION:

Bub isn't there now currently an

overlap between the state laws and the Longshoremen’s
MR* BALDWIN:

By overlap do you imam today or

do you mean when this accident happened?
QUESTION:

Well, when it happened*

MR. BALDWIN;
QUESTION:

I would say that —

.

Tour argument is that getting a re­

covery under state lav: precluded a recovery under the
Longshoremen*s Act,
MR, BALDWIN:
Tour Honor*

There is no overlap in this case,

There is not —— this Court decided in 1969

the Naclrema case where an employee fell off a ship onto
a pier and it refused to extend the jurisdiction to the
pier.

There is a border some place, but in this ease it

really doesn’t apply because Mr* Thomas was injured in
Arlington, Virginia* and the overlap question doesn’t
pertain to this ease.
QUESTION:

Well, was this question presented to

if
the Court of Appeals?
MR. BALDWIN:

Yes, it was in brief. Your Honor:

The court *—>
QUESTION:

And they didnst decide It?

MR. BALDWIN:

They did not decide It..

Xn regard to timeliness> four Honor, the
employee has a year tq file, and ten years later, in IS
Congress enacted: s, different provision that said time is
not going to r\m against the employes until the employer
also files, but the purpose of this enactment was to pre­
vent employer overreaching, which is certainly not an
issue in this ease.

It also provided the employee h:Ls

In Me Cart in* the Court said If, it were apparent
that an Illinois award was intended to b© final and iconelusive of all the rights of the employee against the
employer» then Magnolia would control.

Beyond its de­

cisive facta* the Magnolia court looked at three things.
If looked at the award* its nature and effect, statutory
construction and legislative intent* and eases to Interpret
it.

What are the decisive facts in Me Cartin 3
The decisive facts show that there are two

simultaneous proceedings going on, one in Illinois and
one in Wisconsin.

Wisconsin was studied while awaiting

a lump-sum agreement without prejudice to be approved In

*5
Illinois.

What did Illinois do?

Illinois agreed with

this arrangement through one of its commissioners, Mr.
Granada, who had apparent authority to approve the ex­
press intent of the parties,

The nature of the award was

that it was expressly without prejudice to proceed to
Wisconsin.

The effect of the award was that it was not

final, it was expressly not final5 and so the court in
Illinois could not bind the parties,
I should note that an agreement of this type
coses within the exception of res judicata from the re­
st atejsant of judgments.
