ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. ITdidBORKB, ESQ»,
OH BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MHe GLAXBQBNB:

Mr* Chief Justice3 and may it

please the Court:
This Is part — I wish I could say the last
part •“*» of the final chapter in too- dispate between the
United States and the State of Louisiana over the' miner'Ll
resources of the Continental Shelf off the coast ©f that
state*, a conferovsrby which has been before this Court
since 19*53«
At the end of the day* Louisiana’s Sore eat»
traVaganfe claims to parts of that Continental Shelf ■aera
rejected ant, its- was sett lee-, that Louisiana san entitled
only to a three-ssile belt measured from its coast in the
usual '-jay,
Finally? in. 1975* the Lousiana coastlines, that
is to

*. iy the base line fre® which that three-® tie belt

is measured was fixed by decree
on June loth*

entered by this Court

That decree was jointly submitted by the

parties and entered by consent*

1 immediately sfcr&s that tr t decree2 in aefin­
ing the areas that were federal ?r„d the,

2

watch were state

expressly provided, that the coastline defined in it was to
be taken as the past and present coastline for all r-e.lev: n
times and purposes.

That is to. say that try. 2 or not. as

a matter of law, the coastline was treated as having beer
unchanged and the portions attributable to the federal and
state government unchanged since June 3* 1950» the account
ing date, the earliest relevant date, with only three
exceptions which fortunately do not concern us here.

In

three areas, the Court approved the Master's finding that
for some periods islands or extensions of the mainland
had existed whereas for others they have not.
The relevance of this is that

,11 the account­

ings in this case have been based on chat premise., that
is that the coastline has not changed in thirty years.
Now. although the three-mile line extending
from the coastline has not formally been entered by
decree here, the parties within a month of the Court's
last decision, the decree of June 16, 1975* agreed to
chat line simply as a matter of rathematieal projection,
and that description has been submitted to the Special
faster and is before the Court and there is no dispute
about it.
QUESTION:

There

no what?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

There is no dispute between tine

parties with respect to it.

What remains are purely ac­

counting issues, not boundary questions.
geographyo

We are done with

We are now quarreling about money,

that is to

say the monetary consequences of the boundary determina­
ti op. s „
We had hoped that no such issue would remain for
this Court and indeed it did not appear that there was any
disagreement between the parties until 1975 when for the
first time Louisiana made the claims which this Court
referred to its Special Master on which he wrote a report
and which are now before this Court on exceptions to that
report.
So far as this Court is concerned if it ac­
cepts our acquiesence in one of the rulings of the
Special Master adverse to the United States with respect
to severance tax, which we

not press here, that leaves

two issues.
The first issue is simply put whether Louisiana
must pay over to the United States subject to appropriate
offsets the oil and gas revenues which it collected from
lessees since June 1950 and which are attributable to
federal areas of the Continental Shelf, just as the
United States :vu3t pay, for the most part has paid to
Louisiana the receipts from the same data attributable

&
to stat® lands.
QUESTION:

Do you know how much Is involved in

that5 Mr. Claiborne?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Approximately $19 Million.

Louisiana says —
QUESTION:

This involves Zone 1* so-called?

Mil CLAIBORNE:

Well, so we thought.

In fact,

it involves portions, monies from Zone 2 as veil, approxi­
mately —
S'TXQM:

On the other side, it involves

Zone 4, right?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

There is no issue with respect

to Zone- 4 because —
QUESTION:

No, but ~~

MR. CLAIBORNE:

There would have been had

Louisiana been —QUESTION:

It is what you call extravagant

claims, it would have binvolved Sons 4.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed, though they would hav*

been more extravagant than Louisiana ever put forward
because Zone 4 was defined as that- area which Louisiana
did not by its most extravagant claims assert.
QUESTION:

Otherwise it would have been two or

three.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed.

Now, Louisiana says it

will keep all of this money ait rib at able to federal land;:
since 19509 and the Special Master agreed, with the state.
We have accordingly filed an exception here.
The second issue is whether the United States
must pay interest or some like sum in respect of the
monies

attributable to state lands which wore "impounded"

in the federal Treasury until they were paid over to
Louisiana in mid-1975.
QUESTION:

And were they paid over without in­

terest at that time?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

They were paid over without

There is no complaint that we did not dislodge

all of the monies actually received from state lands,

There is no —~

QUESTION:

How much interest is involved?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

We had paid over to Louisiana

to date fcU! million.
QUESTION:

What la the interest on that?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

The interest on that by one

computation put by Louisiana would, be approximately
million.
QUESTION:

'And the Master held that you owed no

interest, or its equivalent ana also held that, you were nou

entitled to get the rents erroneously or royalties
erroneously paid, to Louisiana?
MR. CLAIBOME:
QUESTION:

Did I get it correct or incorrect?

MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:
rect?

Exactly so, Mr. Justice Stewar .

The Master --

Did. you say I was correct or incor ­

I know I am getting old.., but it seems to me that

I am getting deaf because I don’t hear- you very well.
MR. CLAIBORNE:
said, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I’m sorry.

It is exactly as you

The Master held with Louisiana

oh its claim to retain what we call the federal monies
from. Zone 1 and partially Zone 2.

He held with the United

States in that he rejected Louisiana's claim to interest
on the impounded funds which we for the most part have
long since paid over.
Now, I shall address both issues but, being
the except all with respect to the federal monies Louisiana
retains s I shall concentrate my argument there„
indicated, some $19 million are involved.

As I have

It has been

called the Zone 1 issue and so it seamed at first, but
later — and I may say after the accountings filed in
in this Court and in the proceedings before the Special
Master and in some eases only in the last two or three
years., reference having been five years ago. Louisiana
has changed its position somewhat and is now resisting,

as we understand theia — the Attorney General can co. ;
correct me — resisting pacing any of the monies collect :d
by the state from federal submerged lands ±r any zcn.i f•:.
any period, including the last five years, and indeed
including until such time as this Court enters a .further
decree,
Mow., it is unfortunately necessary to explain
what Zone 1 is*

By 1956, both the United States and the

state were granting leases, conflicting leases in the
area which Louisiana claimed to be its submerged land
under the act passed three years earlier.

Louisiana

sought injunctions and obtained injunctions in its own
state courts*

We had by this time filed a motion for

leave to renew the case in this Court srhich had been
granted and accordingly we applied here *
This Court, on the application of the United
States, enjoined both parties from granting any new 'leases
and. their lessees from drilling any further wells.

That

situation produced the so-called Interim agreement of
1556,

That agreement divided the Continental Shelf into

the four sones.

Zone 1, with which we are primarily con­

cerned, is the area three miles wide and nearest the
Louisiana coast.

It was fixed on a rough —~ ®l*d 1

emphasise rough — approximation of toe area which the
United States then believed under then principles, since

AO
changed, had been granted a; the Submerged Lands Act to
Louisiana.
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, I take it that if the

Interim agreement had not come into existence, this isstif
would not he here?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well., Mr. Justice 31&ckmun, so

it seemed, but Louisiana now makes a wholly differentargument none the least dependent on the interim .agreement
which is that though they received the money they never
really leasee-, our lands because the lease doscriptions

-iere such that impliedly they were telling the lessee
you drill or occupy federal lands at your own risk, an
argument with which I will < .cal but which is the latest
of Louisiana positions.
Now, this Court has already clearly held that
neither party was bound by the Zone 1 line and indeed it­
is because of that holding that the major part of the
present controversy arises, because the United States
was adjudicated to be the true owner of lands within
Zone IU

On the other hand, the state was entitled under

this Court’s decision to the lands seaward of that sons.
So the Zone 1 line and the true boundary line do not
coincide.
One more word about the interim agreement at.
this point.

That agreement did provide Louisiana4 s

ij.
primary reliar.es os this fact, that Louisiana would have
exclusive administrative control in that rone, and it was
not provided that the revenues derived from its leases
there need be impounded3 whereas, in loan: 2 and 5 in
practice administered by the United States , those revenv.-: s
must be impounded against the day when the true ownership
was decided.
In Zone 4, as I have already indicated beyond
any Louisiana claim, the United States was free to gr.?nt
leases and had no obligation to impound.
QUESTION:

What was the practical reason for

that distinction in treatment?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Because, Mr. Justice Blackraun,

it was recognised and largely correctly .hat most of
Zone 1. would in any event go to Louisiana even though it
was known then that the boundary was not accurate.
Louisiana asked and the United States agreed to alio*/ it
to enjoy some.of the revenues from this area and therefore
since most of those revenues would in any evan*., remain
with Louisiana, it seemed right and fair to permit
Louisiana to enjoy those revenues without a duty to imp Q TA? i. U. 5

It would., however, have been nonsense and mosv
improvident for the United States to have agreed to waive
all its claims to revenue there without waiving its claim

2
to title.

Ant this Court has made it cl ar that there •..< s

no way for a title, indeed title has ooei adjudicated
there , because , after all, this case was primarily one
about mineral revenues9 not about abstract title.
It would have permitted * as Louisiana says it
did permit, Louisiana largely to drain the area and ho
return to us twenty years later or perhaps twenty-fire
years later an empty title, the oil and gas drained from,
it.

That is precisely what Louisiana says we agreed to.

Why we should have done so is hard to fathom.
.Nowa I have indicated that Louisiana's resistat®
to our claim is in respect to Zone 1 monies between the
dace of the agreement, October 1955, and the date oh which
it ended for this purpose 9 June 1975.

fat they are not

satisfied to resist only those claims, they also resist
the claim, for some $3*3 million derived from Zone 2 whic?
is in no way committed to them by the agreement.
They also resist a claim to an additional
$500.000 derived before the agreement was. entered into
from Zone 1, and they also resist a claim to any amounts
since this Court's degree fixing the boundary, in June

1975

c

Now, the basic question is why shouldn't
Louisiana be required to pay over the monies derived from
federal lands, Just as the united States is required to

do likewise with respect to state lands.

Ever since 1950, the rule of the caa® has been
that the owner of the lands is entitled to the revenues..
regardless of who first received them,

that obligation,

has bean deferred over and over again but it has never
bean varied.
The Special Master himself said this would
certainly be the case in the absence of any adjudication
or agreement between the parties to the contrary, and wo
entirely endorse that statement.

So we look to see

whether there was a ruling by this Court which authorizesi

the exception from what had otherwise been the law of the
case» and we find everything to the contrary.
In 19539 this Court established -the basic rule
Each party must account since June 5; 1950t the date'on
which this Court’s decision in the Louisiana case was
entered.

That was forgiven for the first three miles by

the Submerged Lands Act.

But in 1960s this Court made

clear that that was the extent of the waiver.

In 19:r0,

seven years afer the Submerged Lands Act, and four years
after the '56 agreement 9 and yet Louisiana consented to
the entry of a decree which explicitly requires it to
account and pay over eventually all sums derived from

federal lands with no exception for Zone 1,
In 1965; a supplementai decree followed the same

formula and, most importantly, In the most recent decree
in 1275s the Court entered by consent a decree expressly
requiring Louisiana to account for un imp cn mica monies
since June 1950 derived from federal lands.

Louisiana,

admits that that is the money we are talking about, but
they say the accounting is for information only,

Why it

should have undertaken or the Court should have burdened
it with the net inconsiderable task of computing receipts
for thirty years if nothing were to turn on. It escapes ur>
There is paragraph 13 of the decree which says
that the interim agreement remains in effect tc the ex­
tent not inconsistent with the decree3 but it would be
inconsistent with the provision of the decree requiring
accounting and payment if the interim agreement provide-:'
otherwise,

It dees not.

It was not then understood to

do so.
When that decree was entered, it must be eieau
that all parties believed the accounting obligation had
finally come to fruition.

Now, when we look at the agree

merit itself, we derive no different conclusion.

Of

course, the agreement can’t possibly excuse the failure
to pay monies in Zone 2 or monies derived before the
agreement was ever entered into, even though those were
resisted presumably on ether grounds.
But as to the ’56 and *75 monies, the text of

15
the agreement is very clear that there is no waiver of any
rights.

It is a working agreement.

It Is a modus viventi.

It was deliberately tailored so as to avoid either parti a
giving up anything permanently.

.Louisiana could adminia er,

Louisiana could enjoy for the time being revenues and
nothing more.
As I have already indicated, it would not have
made sense for us to retain our claim to title in this
area and waive our right to revenues in the area at the
same time.

That would have been nothing more than an

incentive for delay.

Nor did either party so understand

the agreement as Louisiana now maintains if we look at
how they behaved afterwards,
Louisiana repeatedly consented to the entry of
decrees which strictly speaking foreclosed its argument
today.

Indeed, in 1966

when it filed an account, in

1975 when it filed an account, it admitted an obligation
to pay some of these revenues which it now denies.
Nov, the Master stressed a quite different point
which was a provision of the Cuter Continental Shelf Act:
that provision is to the effect that when payments are
made pursuant to an agreement with the state, the payments
by the lessee to the state shall be taken as compliance
with what would otherwise be the requirement of payments
to the Secretory.

It seems to us perfectly plain on the

16

face of the statute that what that means is no more that
that the lessee is not in default while he is paying, a.
the United States has agreed with Louisiana, he may
state»

ay the

It In no way excuses the state from refunding t:.v t

money when it is determined that the area was a federal
one.
Finally , Louisiana makes the novel argument
that they didn't really lease our lands, and. they give
you a diagram which suggests that in most instances a
little sliver turned, out to be federal, but most of the
lease was really state lands.

That is very deceptive.

First of all, there are many cases in which 9"
k

percent. 50 percent or a larger portion of the lease was
federal.

There are indeed 1^5 leases in which the entire

area described in the lease turned out to be federal
lands.

In those circumstances, to say that the monies are

net attributable to the federal area is an argument that
I don't suppose Louisiana would advance.

And yet can the

result turn on whether it is 10 percent of the lease area
or 50 percent or 100 percent, or can it turn on whether
there was actual drilling, hecause Louisiana concedes
that the lion's share of the money we are talking aboutr
some $12 million, derives from royalties directly
received from the portion of the l^aso that is federally

ownec:,

tn that case,

it can hardly he said that the raonuy

does not deriva, in the words of the decree, from the
federal lands.
QUESTION:

None of Area H turned out to be

Louisiana5s?
MB.. CLAIBORNE:

It is not Surprising, Mr.

-Justice White, since it was indeed, beyond any argument
that Louisiana had been able to —
QUESTION:

No bargaining power?

MHo CLAIBORNE:

No.

There was, of course, a

surface symmetry to Louisiana’s conceding what they
weren’t claiming, out it Lewdly seems a ~uid pro quo.
One word on the interest issue0

Hera, of

course, the Master ruled with the United States and we
entirely endorse the reasoning of his report.

He adlrconed

both of Louisiana’s arguments, somewhat inconsistent but
never mind.

T

The first was that the United States had a duty
to invest these funds and, having failed to do so, it
must in equity be held to the consequence if it had done
what it was obliged to do.

As to that, the Master said, •

in our view entirely correctly., that indisputably — these
are his words — the interim agreement does not specific­
ally provide for the payment of Interest upon any part of
the funds impounded pursuant to it,

ere’ Indee d Loui3ian. ■,,

for ail present purposes,

think concedes that that

h"0 «

But, say they, there was a tacit understanding
that the United States

would some time or other invest sis

funds, to-which the Master answers, the evidence in this
case clearly negatives any such understanding upon the
part of the parties to the interim agreement.
QUESTION:

Well, it wouldn’t make any difference

to your submission, would it, Mr. Solicitor General, if
the United States had Invested it»
M3. CLAIBORNE:

If we bud invested it not pursu­

ant to the agreement but

for our own purposes, which would

have served no interest of the United States, taking fro*
one pocket and putting it in the other. but it wouldn’t
have made any difference, X quite agree.
Now, Louisiana further says we unjustly enriched
ourselves because we didn’t do what the agreement required
which was to segregate the funds.

The Master- said, incor>.~

trovertit>ly, it seems to us, the Treasury does not keep
money or cash in an office safe, obviously the cash Is
going to he freely used in the same way that a bank uses
the depositor’s money.

It must keep a strict account, it

must put it down as potential liability, so when the day
comes that money will be available without a congressional
appropriation.

Those are important reasons for treating

it as different from ordinary money of the -Treasury.

The

■9
cashj of course, Is to be freely used.

l may, I reserve the remaining few moments

for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. GUSTEs JR,, ESQ,

ON BEHALF OP THE DEFENDANTS
MR. GUSTE:

Mi5. Chief Justice, and may It please

the Court:
You have come to the end almost of a long, la..-;
day and we in Louisiana are trying to come to the end of
a long, long lawsuit.

And if I may for just a moment,

i

would like to bring you back to the story that happened,
because you must know the facts to have a feel for it.
you can’t feel 1'or it by the academic expressions that
are contained in these briefs.
In 1955, the United States of America filed
suit in this Court to stop all leasing out in the Gulf off
Louisiana*s coast.

Now, between 19^7 and 1956, an industry

had begun to build, and fellows who were fishermen
skippers on boats bringing people out to the rigs, and we
brought in people from Texas and Alabama and Mississippi
who went to work in the shipyards building rigs for the
C ut er Cont ine; ital Shelf development, and this industry
was beginning

to burgeon in 1956 when the United States

£-.!

government comes to this Court and says let’s stop all
this leasing because Louisiana is actually leasing on a one
land that belongs to

us.

This Court issued an injunction and that in­
junctio?! literally brought the economy of south Louisian;:
to a standstill,

People couldn’t go to work.

building the rigs.
to do.

They stopped

They didn't know what they were going

The economy was faced with a possible discretion,,

so Louisiana runs up to the Department of the Interior
and saysj look, we're got to do something to get this
business going again, you're throwing people out of work,
you're depriving us of income9 it’s going to hurt a lot
of good people.
So the government says, well, 1 will tell you
what we'll do.

The then Secretary of the Interior took

a pencil® and he figured out what was the most shoreward
line that could possibly be the coast of Louisiana and
he drew that line and it is called the Chapman line.

And

after he drew that line, he said I will tell you what wo
will do, the Submerged Lands Act- gives you three miles
out from the Chapman line by law and we will let you
administer what the law gives you, and you can hold thoseproceeds.
Then t hsy said from that thren milas to the

nc

three Biles , and three ad.lea beyond that. we are

21
going to keep the money.
\

Do you think Louisiana could, argue about it?

Do

you think this is an arm’s length agreement where two
parties are sitting down like in a free discussion?
Louisiana was forced to accept.

They said, okay* you k<?'p

the money that you derive from that area* and when you
find out whose money it isa we want you to give it back.
And then the United States says and we believe everything
beyond that nine miles * which they call Zone ‘5 s is- ours ,
so we won’t impound that, wo will hold it.
So everybody to these discussions called that
agreement an. escrow agreement , and they wrote in the
agreement that the government would impound and hold intact
those funds until it was decided who they really belong/?;
to and then pay out from those impounded funds the monev
that belonged to Louisiana®
Now. That Louisiana’s position is, that that
contract itself is pure and simply a trust agreement.
Not once is the word “trust” used in. the contract, but
that is the simple reason that the law that authorised
the writing of that contract used the word Mimpound” so
the government, in its carefulness, traced the law and
used the word “impound.”
f

But for nineteen years the United States govern­
ment has raid money that

belongs to the State of Louisiana,

and it turns out- that for nineteen years it- us ad that •sor.ey
and it saved the cost of borrowing for nineteen years, a: .d
instead of impounding and holding it intact like an ordin­
ary escrow agent is obliged to do under law, they used, the
money«

Instead of —

QUESTION:

The United States is not an ordinary

escrow agent though, wouldn’t you agree?
MR. GUSTE:
Burger.

No, I don*fc agree, Mr. Chief Justice

The United States government in this sase is the

plaintiff, and when it comes in as a plaintiff it loses
its sovereignty.

It comes in as any other suiter and is

subject to all of the laws and agreementa of any other
suiter.
Mow, all through the case, Your Honor, and even
in his introductory statement today, learned counsel for
the government says this is an interest claim, and he
did that so that he could lead the Master into those lir i*
of cases which refer to cases in the Court of Claims that
the government simply cannot pay interest unless it is
provided for by specific statute or by contract.

And

sure enough, the Master followed that line of thought,
but that is not what the case is.

QUESTION:

What is the legal rate when they arc-

MR. GUSTE:

Well, you know we rely in our brie)

on an l8*il statute that says that the government shall 1: vest trust funds and government securities at 5 percent.
Now, over the years rates have varied from time to time
and our calculation for the — this amounts to $88 million,

that way.

You may not see fit to arrive at it

The government does in the brief.

But -some

manner of computing the value of the use by the govern­
ment of Louisiana*s money ought to be determined, and we
don’t feel that immunity is a defense»
Now, the Master gives only two factual points
in support of his conclusion that the agreement itself
doesn’t impliedly require 1: vestssat at interes t for the
benefit of Louisiana.

And those two reasons ar ■a, one, he

aays the subject vas never discussed, and that is true.
It wasn’t discussed whether the United States x?ould pay

Then he brings out the second point but, do yo> ■
know., he says the Louisiana witnesses who negotiated this
contract admitted that the reason they didn’t bring it up
was because they knew the United States wouldn't agree to
pay its so he says that solves it.
Well, first of all, that is a subjective consid­
eration,

Bufc he doesn't report to this Court the rest of

what they thought.

They didn’t bring it up, their testi'

mony shows, because they felt it

ined implicit

in the words of the contract, that this was an. escrow
agreement and that the escrow agent, to wit, the United
States, was obliged to pay that interest when it finallymade the distribution.

That is a rather remarkable argument,

if I understand you correctly,

You are saying that they

the United States

That's right, they —

MR. GUSTS:

Oh. no.

MR. GESTE:

Well, apparently you didn't have thf

MR. GUSTS:

But we thought so at the table of

And the fact of the matter is once you

demolish these subjective thoughts, you come to the real
evidence and the real evidence — and it is stated to be
factually correct in the report of the Master — is, one.,
the negotiators for Louisiana and the United States, both

QUESTION:

Which way do you run it, that they

would or that they should or shouldn’t pay interest?
MR. OUSTS:

Ho, 1 would run that to the effect,

that, no matter what they thought, interest would have to
begin at the end of the longest period of time, a year
and six months, because that is all they were thinking
about, ail of the parties at that table*

Instead, the

thing goes on. for nineteen /ears-.
QUESTION:

Why wasn*t any of the principle eve:

All right.

Some of it was.

1965, this Court had made an interim determination that
some bays belonged to Louisiana, and a distribution was
made at that time of $37 million,
QUESTION:
MR. GUSTS:

With interest or without?
No, just a cheek for the principle,

no interest.
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't your claim for int«*r

est have been good then?
MR. GUSTE:

Ho, and I will tell you why.

At

that time, this Court specifically retained jurisdiction
to settle all accounting matters relating to this case
with the final decree, so there was na reason to bring :.h
up then when that determination would be made after the
r

final decree and we did not bring it up.

argued in brief —- whereby the Louisiana legislature

Turning to the Zone 1 issue

and I respect­

fully submits Your Honors9 that it Is indeed only a Zone
1 issue — I could not have been more shocked if the
United Stales had stood before thin Court and posed the
issue as to how many times do I beat my wife.

There were

assumptions implicit in the United States statement of
the issues that are just simply incorrect and grossly
inaccurate.
For examples the statement that we have not
paid or credited funds in Zones 2 or 3- we have.
accounting show this.

Our

Cur defenses are solely made in

our pleadings sv to Zone 1; X~5 leases are referred to

in Zone 2» we have made credits in our accounting.

I

don’t know how the United. States got this.
Additionally» the United States in stating the*
issue as it has has built an assumption on an important
.factual issue that the Master found contrary of the as­
sumption.

Let me read this:

"The United States respect

fully excepts to the report of the Special Raster insofa
as he recommends overruling its objections to the ac­
countings’* -- and it goes on and refers to the funds —
**as derived from or. attributable to submerged lands
adjudicated to be within the exclusive domain of the
Uni-tea States.,”

The assumption is explicit, .

As in a question related to wife beating» .
there Is no question but what the funds are derived from
or attributable to the United States, and quite to the
■ contrary of this assumption, the !.‘aster upon the con­
sideration of 118 lease documents and approximately ;

Indeed, we doubt­

There was only one area where a bay was one by
the United States*, and that was Caillou Bay* and this
involved two leases, leases granted before 1950 and the

to account for.

Ewery other one under the language of the
Court * s decree in 1975» which tracks back to the history
of'the language la 1950, every other one of those leases

were so-called unit agreement» which are pooling agree­
ments which it was agreed would be revised under an
amendment to the interim agreement of 1956, which it was
agreed would be revised after the interim agreement —
pardon me, after the final degree; in the case to revise
the participation.
Incidentally, let me turn to some of the
language of that interim agreement to make the point that
apart- from the question of what was derived from and even
conceding arguendo only for the moment that w© were to
lose, still there would be the position of Louisiana,
based upon the fact that the interim agreement, rights
under which were reserved In paragraph 13 of the .Court * s
decree of 1975, conferred upon Louisiana, the right to
lease and the right to retain the revenues from that
leasing.
Incidentally, on that problem, Your Honor, the
•Master did explicitly make a finding, a fact finding upon
the hearing of the testimony of the witnesses, upon the
reading of the documents and the cross-interpretation of
it, that there was-an intent for both the United States
to Zone 4 — and the deal was the same as to both
governments

and Louisiana as- to Zone 1 to not only

grant leases but to receive and retain the revenues im&v
that leasing arrangement.
For example 3 as language in the interim agree­
ment that explicitly relates to the retention of payment s *
also this agreement as between — 1 refer to page 18a of
the government’s brief, the last sentence of subparagraph
Ce) of paragraph 14 of the interim agreement:

"Also,

this agreement as between the United States and the Stato
of Louisiana, shall continue in effect as to the payments
made with respect to such lease'»K

It war. contemplat 3d

that payments would be mad© under the lease, and ©vert
after the decree the agreement would continue to be
effectives to have sort of legalised and authorised
those payments that have been mad® to the party author­
ised for them to foe made under the agreement.
Additionallya in the language of the interim
agreement, this stipulation and agreement shall terminate
as to any area — this is in paragraph 149 the second
paragraph thereof —- shall terminate as to any area upon
the final settlement or determination of the aforesaid
controversy with respect to such urea, and the word
"thereafter"' then appears — and thereafter the successful
party shall have exclusive jurisdiction and control over
the area so determined.
We received a contract right. Your- donor, of

exclusive Jurisdiction and control ovsr Zone i3 and shat
is all we are claiming her©, Your Honor.

Xt has been 1 r. -

correctly represented that our position relates to Zone
and Zone 3*

This is all we are claiming here, is a right

in Zone 1 in this connection, under this provision.
1 would like to point out too that if there is
broad language of the decree, indeed there isg that sums
derived ~~ and this is the position- of the United States
— that all sub: : derived fro* mineral leasing or from
mineral resources from property belcnging to the other
government should ba paid to tbs other government, then.
Ydur Honors, I submit that the very reasoning of the
United States on the Zone 1 claim sustains the claim of
Louisiana to the sums of money derived from the natural
resources of Louisiana through financial benefits en­
joyed by the United States through the use of the mineral
leasing revenue of Louisiana, and that this Court has
already adjudicated that issue.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have about four

minutes remaining, Mr. Claiborne.
ORAL .ARGUMENT 0- LOUIS J7. CLAIBORNE, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF — REBUTTAL
MR.

c.LAIBOFIIEj

please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it

I think I can be wry brief*' arid use less .than
that allotted time.
One, two answers to questions asked by the Court
with respect to the interest issue;

It should be known

that Louisiana received monthly reports from

1956

to date

indicating precisely how much so nay was impounded in theTreasury.

Those reports very clearly reflected during

all that period that no interest or other increment was
being added to the fund, therefore ne question of surprise.
Secondly, in i960., four year© after the. agreeffiesit had been in effect9 Louisiana's congressional dele­
gation. both Senate and all members of the House, the
Attorney General of Louisiana and the legislature of
Louisiana concurred in requesting not that the funds fee
invested, not that interest be paid, but that the monies
in the Treasury be transferred to Louisiana banks, so fcha*
they could enjoy the free use of that money.

That request

was denied on fchs ground that It would set an unfortunate

precedent.
Then Louisiana received its $3# million in 1966,
no complaint about the failure to add interest.

In

196?£

the Louisiana legislature, as represented, did memorialise
federal officials to hen2© forward — not for the past —
please respectfully request is their language* invest
these funds..

No el aim that there ms a duty to invest.

42

no el&li» th&t they had a right to interest for t-Si© sums
they had just been paid, but simply a request to change
the agreement for the future, in effect.
The Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
responded that Treasury regulations forbad him from making
any such investment In the absence of statutory authority.
It/ may be that the *56 agreement could have been amended
to so provide.

Louisiana did not suggest it,

didnTfc.take the matter further.

They

They ne ar said another

thing about it until 1975dew. they could have asked for an amendment of

the agreement.

Or if the duty already arose under the

?56 agreement., obviously they could have come to this
Court and said we will not accept the response by federal,
officials.
QUESTION:

What It you had invested itt

Suppose

there had been statutory authority available to the
fiscal officer to invest the money and he went out and
invested it and interest was earned on it.
Ml. CLAIBORNE:

I think. Mr. Justice White,

;t if the agreement had accordingly been amended ~~
QlIESTICK:
menf

Well, I asa talking about this agree •
didn’t call

but you nevertheless invest it,
MR. CLAIBORNE:

That might properly be viewed

iO

as an implied amendment of the agreement dor?a at tfea re ­
quest of Louisiana, the acquiescence of the United State*
with respect to monies held under the agreement,

One

could say that tad varied the agreement, and —
QUESTION:

Wella -mat if you had invested it

from the outset?

- .

MR, CLAIBORNEi

Well, In those circumstances I

don’t think we world owe interest because the agreement
doesn’t provide for it, bub there would be an equitable
claim that we should have some of the benefit of it,.

A.

far as the -QUSSTXON-:

Then why isn’t there an equitable

claim that they should have the benefit of your use of
the money?

I mean

you have used it for- your benefit,

MR, CLAIBORNE:

The equities are no stronger

against our use- of the money than they are with respect
tc Louisiana’s use of our money for thirty years on which
we claim no interest and. have no. right to claim any in­
terest,

It was part of the bargain that Louisiana would

enjoy these revenues until each time as they lost the
land, if that day should come,

It was also part of the

bargain that the United States would hold and us'®' the
fun'&s in escrow in the Treasury»

That bargain was

mad®,

it’’was never varied - and both parties had agreed to it.
Thank you.
