MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-10889 Kissinger v, Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press, et al., and the related case.
Mr. Ginsburg, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID GINSBURG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER KISSINGER
MR. GINSBURG:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I represent Dr. Henry Kissinger who is

the petitioner In 1088 and the cross-petitioner in 1217,
The material facts in this case are not in dis­
pute as it comes here on cross motions for summary judg­
ment ,
At the White House and at the State Department,
Dr. Kissinger had his secretaries monitor his telephone
conversations, take shorthand notes of all that x?as said
and prepare rough typewritten summaries.

The practice was

specifically approved by senior department officials and
by State Department policy.

The purpose was to ease the

administrative burdens of office by enabling Dr. Kissinger’s
personal aides without further briefing to implement and
follow up what was said or what was agreed.

They were

used as work aids, and it was these follow-up actions that
produced the records which are presently in the departments

5
files, aid memos and memorandums of telephone conversations
memorandums to the file, other documents which were circu­
lated and filed in the normal course of business in the
State Department, and these official records are voluminous
The notes themselves were not made or kept as
records.

They do not have the form of records, they were

never edited, they contain omissions, they are not accurate
They were never circulated outside of Dr. Kissinger's
office.

No one other than Dr. Kissinger and his Immediate

aides had access to them.
QUESTION:

You are speaking now of the White

House period or both?
MR. 6INSBURG:

Both the White House period, Mr,

Chief Justice, and of the State Department, both periods,
were always retained In personal files within his office,
never part of either the White House files or the State
Department files.
The notes reflect almost all of Dr. Kissinger's
telephone conversations, regardless of content.

They con­

tain notes of both official and personal matters, some
important and some, of course, inconsequential.

Inter­

mingling was unavoidable, given —
QUESTION:
were omissions?

Mr. Glnsburg, how do you know there

How does anyone know there were omissions?

MR. GINSBURG:

Simply by the affidavits that are

6
in the file in this record by those who have examined the
notes, and we have the affidavits in the record in this
case.
QUESTION:

You mean there were some things that

were said on the phone that are not in the notes, is that
it?
MR. GINSBURG:

Some things that were said in

the notes that are said to be not accurate.
QUESTION:

I know, but how about omissions?

You said there are omissions.
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

And omissions.

So there were some telephone conver-

sations that were not noted?
MR. GINSBURG:

There were some telephone con­

versations that were not taken, although almost all as
the affidavits in this record show, were taken.
QUESTION:

Well, were these omissions deliberl
\

ate or inadvertent simply because of the difficulties
involved?
MR. GINSBURG:

Both, Your Honor.

What actually

happened in this case is that some the Secretary knew,
some cases that were purely personal, in the event it was
a. personal telephone call and no record -— a very personal
telephone call and no record was made.
course

But in the normal

every telephone call by aides, by the President,

7
by whoever it was, the conversation was recorded and the
notes were made.

These notes were reviewed by Dr.

Kissinger, his affidavit is in the record to the effect
that there are omissionss inaccuracies in the notes that
were taken and there were other omissions.
Of course, had Dr. Kissinger known that these
notes might be viewed as official agency records, he
would have either put them in proper form for filing or
more likely he would have discontinued the practice alto­
gether.
Now, toward the end of his term, Dr. Kissinger
decided to donate both his Harvard papers and the papers
he accumulated in government service to the United States,
and he chose the Library of Congress as the custodian
because it had been used as a depository by many other
Secretaries of State and, as the government points out,
by a great many other Cabinet officers.
The donation procea'^ within the department in\

eluded several steps, each of which was approved by the
legal adviser, by the Assistant Secretary for Administra­
tion, by the Deputy Under Secretary for Management, and
by the Director of the Department's Records Center.
QUESTION:

All of them, of course, were subordln

ate to Dr. Kissinger -when he was Secretary of State?
MR. GINSBURG:

All of them were subordinates,

8
Your Honor, all of them, if I may point out —
QUESTION:

But none of this really has anything

to do with your primary argument, does it?
MR, GINSBURG:

It does not, sir.

In a memorandum signed by all of these, Dr.
Kissinger was advised that his personal files were freely
transferable to the library under the departments regula­
tions .

Each signer of the memorandum knew that the notes

were in Dr. Kissinger’s personal files.

The legal adviser

gave Dr. Kissinger a formal written opinion confirming the
previous oral advice that the notes were not State Depart­
ment agency records.
QUESTION:

Mr. Glnsburg, is the legal adviser

an appointee of the Secretary of State or of the President?
MR. GIMSBURG:

He is appointed by the President

and confirmed by the Senate and is a respected member of
the bar of this Court.

/

In that opinion, the legal adviser considered
the agency regulations, government practice and then
analogous judicial opinions, and he concluded that "these
particular papers are personal and may be retained by you
when you leave office."

But as a precaution to assure

that the government’s records were complete, the legal
adviser recommended that Dr. Kissinger review and make
extracts of any discussion of significant policy decisions

9
or actions not otherwise reflected in the official files,
and this was done»
Now, Dr. Kissinger donated all of the papers
subject to deeds of gift which restrict access to the
collection and these restrictions were designed to protect
the classified information in the notes and the other
records and the privacy rights.

The notes will be made

available for public access after twenty-five years but
only with the consent of those who participated in the
conversations if they are then still living,
After the donations were publicly announced and
after the notes and the other papers were transferred to
the library

D

the Reporters Committee filed requests and

the Military Audit Project filed requests with the State
Department for these records.

Both requests were denied.
v

Soph denials were made by persons then serving under
Secretary Vance,

f

The grounds for denial were that the notes were
not Stats Department agency records and that the depart­
ment in any event did not have them in its custody or
control.

The Military Audit Project and the Reporters

Committee then filed separate Freedom of

Action suits

against the State Department and Secretary Vance and
named Dr. Kissinger and the Librarian of Congress as
defendants.

10
On cross motions for summary judgment, the
District Court held that the Freedom of Information Act
did not apply to notes of the White House period but that
the State Department period notes were agency records
subject to the Act.

The court then ordered Dr. Kissinger

and the Library of Congress to return all the State
Department notes to that department for processing and
release under the Freedom of Information Act,
QUESTION:

Was the Librarian a party to the

action?
MR. GINSBURG:

The Librarian was named as a

party to the action, although of course he is not an
agency under the Freedom of Information Act and of course
neither is Dr. Kissinger as an individual.

But the Court

of Appeals affirmed, so that as we see it the central
issue In this case is whether the Freedom of Information

I

Act gives the Military Audit Project and the Reporters
Committee a right of access to documents which the State
Department has specifically determined were not its records
before any requests for them were filed and records which
it does not have and cannot produce.
Now, first the issue —
QUESTION:

Whatever the determination of the

State Department may have been, wouldn't your argument
really be the same if you just eliminated that middle

11
language and said does the POIA cover — impose a duty
upon the State Department not to withhold and to deliver
records that it does not have?
MR, GINSBURG:

I make a point simply to avoid

the problem» in order to clarify the issue, Mr. Justice
Stewart» that there was proper relinquishment, whatever
it was.
QUESTION:

Whether or not it was proper»

wouldn't your argument be the same?
MR. GINSBURG:

Our argument would be the same

and I think that it is clear that the act does not apply
in these circumstances.
QUESTION:

That is what I thought your argument

was.
MR. GINSBURG:

But our primary submission, and

this is a submission with which the government agrees
QUESTION:

Mr. Ginsburg, when an agency makes a

determination before any demand is pending or when a demand
is made that particular material is not an agency record9
what is the review procedure that is available for that
other than judicial?
MR. GINSBURG:

It is the issue, Mr. Chief

Justice, of course not all documents in the hands of an
agency are records.
are filed as records.

They do not become records until they
The Court was concerned in the

12
previous case with the definition of records.

Records as

we see it are simply those documents which are defined as
records for purposes of the Federal Records Act which are
filed by an agency as its records.

So that in this case

the issue was clear that they were not filed as records,
they could not have been filed as records, they were always
kept in the personal files within the office of Dr.
Kissinger, never circulated outside of his office, never
seen by anyone other than his closest aides.

So when we

are —
QUESTION:

So these are not agency records even

if they were still at the State Department?
MR. GINSBURG:

Oh, it is clear that they were not

records of the State Department.

The State Department

never treated them as records, never sought to use them as
records.

There was no declaration that they were records.
QUESTION:

Conversely, even if they were once

agency records, there is no obligation to turn — of the
State Department to turn over something that maybe once
might have been agency records if it does not at the time
of the request have possession and/or control of it, is
that
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Is that also your argument?

MR. GINSBURG:

1 wouldn’t say. it is all of our

13
argument because* I —
QUESTION:

Is that also your argument?

MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes, that is, sir.

That is —

Not your entire argument but that is

also your argument.
MR. GINSBURG:

QUESTION 2

That is also our argument

„

yes.

But you would say -- my brother

Stevens asked you — that even if the records were in the
possession of the State Department at this time or if
these papers were in the possession of the State Depart­
ments, they would not be subject to the act because they

were not records.
MR. GINSBURG:

That is exactly right, sirs they

wore not records, they were not treated as records # they
didn’t look like records, no one thought of them as
records and no one else saw them.

\

QUESTION:

You don’t make the possession argu­

ment in your brief, do you?
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Possession?

You say they aren't records subject

to —
MR, GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

We are making the point that —

— subject to production and hence

it is Irrelevant to you whether they are in possession of

the State Department or not, at least It is irrelevant
for that argument.
MR. GINSBURG:

Well, the possession argument

comes into this argument simply because these notes are
presently in the hands of the Library of Congress and to
secure them is not simply a ministerial act of obtaining
them from bailee.

A lawsuit is required to obtain these

documents.
I point out first that the
QUESTION:

And not a lawsuit under the POIA.

MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

That is your submission.

MR. GINSBURG:

Absolutely.

The requesters in this case rely solely on the
Freedom of Information Act and that statute, as this Court
has heard repeatedly this morning, gives the District
Courts jurisdiction to enjoin agencies from withholding
agency records.

We submit that tike District Court in this

case had absolutely no subject matter jurisdiction under
the Freedom of Information Act to enter any order in this
case.
First, neither Dr. Kissinger nor the Library of
Congress is an agency under that act, and the Freedom of
Information Act cannot be used to sue private citisens
and adjudicate their rights, their substantive rights.

15
Second, the State Department, of course, is an
agency but the question is whether it violated the act by
withholding any agency records.

The Reporters Committee

and the Military Audit Project say that it did on the
theory that the Freedom of Information Act imposes a duty
on the department to —
QUESTION:

Mr. Ginsburg, let me go back Ju3t a

minute to the point you just made.

Supposing that Dr.

Kissinger, instead of disposing of the record to the
Library of Congress, had sent them to a private warehouse
where he had a warehouse where he could pick them up any
time he wanted to.

Isn't it conceivable under the decision

in Bannereraft that a Freedom of Information Act court,
using I believe what was referred to as its customary
equitable powers, could require the warehouse owner to
deliver up the records if it concluded that they other­
wise satisfied the FOIA?
MR. GINSBURG:
Rehnquist.

I think not, Mr. Justice

Under Bannereraft, it is very clear that the

Renegotiation Board had those records, they were in the
possession and control of the agency, no doubt about it,
and this was an aetion to enjoin the continuation of the
procedures in that case, and at that time the Court ob­
served that it could, having jurisdiction, with records
in the hands of the agency, the court could, of course,

16
exercise equitable jurisdiction and do whatever was neces*»
say to protect that jurisdiction.
But in this case the records were never in the
hands of the agency as agency records, and presently of
course they are in the hands of the Library of Congress.
Bannercraft I think has no application here.
QUESTION:

Whatever they were, was Dr, Kissinger's

gift to the Library of Congress irrevocable?
MR, GINSBURG:

It was irrevocable^ under a deed

of trust.
QUESTION:

He could not individually carry out

a command to get them back?
MR. GINSBURG:

Certainly not.

These notes are

now owned by the government of the United States, they
are in the custody of the Library of Congress,
QUESTION:

Well, what had Dr. Kissinger had

given the entire records of the State Department to the
Library of Congress?
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

It would have been a problem --

Would that have been irrevocable?

MR. GINSBURG:

No, sir.

I think that the

question is — you have used the term "records" and this
is I think a problem that the Court must consider here.
The moment you use the word "records" when dealing with
something that an agency has determined were its records.

17
and If we are not dealing with records as vie are not
dealing with records in this case, we are dealing with a
claim that they should have been records, that the State
Department should have regarded these notes as records,
but they didnH and they specifically determined that they
didn*t.
QUESTION:

Well, if they are not records, you

never get any further, do you?
MR. GINSBURG:

That is exactly right.

This is

the first issue that I am seeking to address now, Is the
issue of jurisdiction, not whether they were records.
There is a problem, and I will get to that in a moment,
to consider that issue if the Court ever reaches it.
But the central issue of this case as vie see it
is that these were not records, they were not regarded by
the State Department as records, never viewed as records,
never treated as records, and ~
QUESTION:

On that point, Mr. Ginsburg, I take

it that the case would be the same if instead of saying
the Library of Congress, they were In Dr. Kissinger’s
basement?
MR. GINSBURG:

If they were In Dr. Kissinger’s

basement as personal property •—
QUESTION:

It would be the same case?

MR. GINSBURG:

which of course he could have

18
done at any time —
QUESTION:

So the fact that they are in the

Library of Congress rather than in his possession is
legally irrelevant?
MR. GINSBURG:

I don’t think it is legally ir­

relevant except in the sense that ~
QUESTION:

For this arguments it is?

MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

To this —

They are not records, whereve they

are.
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Thatfs right.

But to what argument would it make

a difference whether they are in the Library of Congress
instead of In his possession?
ME. GINSBURG:

There is no way in which Dr.

Kissinger can Just reach over to these notes and bring
them back into —
QUESTION:

,
Yes, but he is not the agencya as

you make a very good point.

It is the State Department

and the State Department has no control over him.
MR. GINSBURG:

Nor has the State Department

any control over the Library of Congress.
QUESTION:

Right, so if they are with him in­

stead of the Library of Congress, it would be precisely
the same legal question?

19
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

It would for thise purpose.

1 take It, Mr. Ginsburg, that your

case -MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

For all purposes.

— rests on the proposition that

these — I will call them materials rather than records ~
these materials are Dr. Kissinger's personal property.
MR. GINSBURG:

They are indeed and they were so

determined by the department.
QUESTION:

And that being the case, I take It

the record does not show any income tax effect upon hls
turning them over to the Library of Congress?
MR. GINSBURG:

The record doesn't show that,

there is nothing in the record that bears any income tax
advantage — is that what you said, sir?
QUESTION:

I did.

MR. GINSBURG:

No, sir, the record doesn't show

that but I can assure the Court that there is none.
QUESTION: ^Was any available?
MR. GINSBURG:
*

QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?

Was any available at the time he made

the gift?
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Not to my knowledge.

It well may not have been available

under the current version of the code.

20

MR, GINSBURG:

That issue is not here and 1 don't

believe it is part of this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Glnsburg, I take it your argument

does go so far as to say that at no time was any of these
~ was any one of these papers a record for the purposes
of the POIAp

say the minute after the transcription was

made?
MR. GINSBURG:

Exactly right, that is our argu-

ment.
QUESTION:

And before any extracts were mad®

for the purposes of the files?
MR, GINSBURG:

Yes, they were not created for the

purpose of records, they were created for the purpose of
advising his immediate aides as to what he had Just said
so that he didn't have to tell them right away what he
had talked about on the phone.
spoke with others —
QUESTION:

The fast i

They read it and then they

i

that is why he created

them, so that they wouldn't have to tell anybody.
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Exactly right,

Then it seems to me that is an argu­

ment for saying that these papers at least until they have
been extracted, to take out the materials relevant to the
State Department business, that were critical to the State
Department business, would, be records.

21
MR. GINSBURG:

Mo, records do not become records

until they are so determined by the — there is no question
in this case, there cannot be a serious question in this
case as to the fact did Dr. Kissinger create an adequate
record of all of the —
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Ginsburg, you emphasized

the fact that Dr. Kissinger went through the procedure
that the legal adviser suggested, namely why don't you go
through these notes of yours and make sure everything is
taken out of them that should have been taken out.
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

But the State —

And he proceeded to do that.

You

would say he didn't need to do that at all because it
wouldn't make any difference what was in the papers.
MR. GINSBURG:

I think fundamentally that was

the position also of the legal adviser, that the records
were made as a consequence of the calls that were made
immediately after or the file memoranda that were made
immediately after the calls were made, and they were put
into the records of the department.
QUESTION:

Your oosition really is fundamentally

different from that of the United States,
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

We differ only —

Well, there is quite a difference.

I would assume they would have answered my question

22
differently, that until there were extracts they were
State Department records.
MR. GINSBURG:

The position of the United States

as I understand it — Mr. Alsup will be here in a moment —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GINSBURG:

—- is that it depends on the

United States* interpretation of the legal adviser's
memorandum.

The government as I understand it suggests

that Mr. Lee intended to make the excerpting process a
condition of the transfer of the records.

This as we see

It — the opinion is in the record for all to see — it
seems to be absolutely clear that this was not his inten­
tion, that he determined on the basis of an analysis of
the State Department's own regulations that Dr. Kissinger
had an absolute right to retain these notes within his
files, and that he did and he determined that these were
his personal papers. But he said as a master of precaution,

leaning over backwards, you, Dr. Kissinger, look through
your files to determine whether this should be done.

Dr.

Kissinger didn't do It himself, he had Mr. Eagleburger do it,
the Deputy Under Secretary for Management, and that was
done.
QUESTION:

But if the Secretary of State is talk­

ing on the telephone and making agreements or making plans
or making proposals that his colleagues ought to know about,

23
he should communicate them and he has one of two ways of
doing it, I suppose.

One, he can take his time and com­

municate them orally and he doesn't need to keep any
records, I suppose, or he can do it the way he did, he
made notes and had them extracted and communicated.

Now,,

if he didn't do either he wouldn't be doing his job,
would he?
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

He has done his job —

I know, but he wouldn't be doing his

job If he didn't do either, if he didn't communicate, if
he chose —
MR. GINSBURG:

He would be in violation of the

State Department regulations.
QUESTION:

Yes.

If he chose to communicat in a

c'ertain way, namely not orally but by writing, and If the
only thing there was that you --if there were ten
recordings or ten transcriptions of telephone conversa­
tions that had never been extracted and there they were
and they contained important Information that had never
been communicated, why would you say that is not a State
Department record?
MR. GINSBURG:

There is a moment of time at

which those — the moment between the time when the records,
when these notes were made and before they were turned over
to anyone, it is conceivable that there was some issue but

2k

that issue Is not In this case.

What happened in this

case is that everyone, that the totality of the information
in the records, in those notes was immediately transferred
to the rest of the department and then by reason of that
memorandum prepared, memorandum of conversations and
these became the records and they are the records.
QUESTION:

Even if one assumes that these are

agency records, don't you also argue that these petitioners
or the plaintiffs below have no private cause of action
under the FIOA?
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

I do indeed, sir.

Are you going to address that?

are sort of running out of time.

You

You have talked a lot

about whether or not they are records.
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

I am running out of time.

It is a very substantial additional

argument.
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

It is.

That is your first argument, it is

Roman One in your brief.
MR. GINSBURG:

It is indeed.

Well, we say that

what the court below did in this case is clear, which is
to create a private right of action.

Under the Freedom of

Information Act, if the records or if the notes are In the
possession of the agency, they must be provided, but here

25
they were not.

The court attempted to create a private

right of action by exercising its general equitable juris­
diction under Cort v. Ash in order to retrieve these
records.

It seems to us absolutely clear, as you read

the Freedom of Information Act, that this cannot be done,
the Congress was explicit in the ease, that the records
may not be withheld from an agency, agency records may not
be withheld, and it seems to me absolutely clear in these
circumstances that a private right of action cannot be
constructed contrary to the legislative intent of the
Freedom of Information Act, contrary it seems to us under
the Federal Records Act*,
There is absolutely a right of action in the
government to retrieve these notes in the event of need.
It is very clear that under the Federal Records Act the
Attorney General on the instance of the Administrator of
the General Services Administration and of the Secretary
involved in this case, the Secretary of State, to retrieve
these, to bring an action under section 3106,
section 3106,

UVS. Code,

There is no doubt about the government’s

right in this case.
The issue in this ease Is whether private requesters
may insist that this action be done and —
QUESTION:

And if there is no such action, that

is the end of the case, isn't it?

26
MR» GINSBURG:

That is the ease In our view, and

I would like to reserve the rest of ray time for rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr5. Glnsburg,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. ALSUP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PARTIES
MR. ALSUP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The federal respondents' threshold submission is
the same as Dr. Kissinger’s threshold submission, and that
is that the Freedom of Information Act does not require an
agency to retrieve documents it once possessed but no
longer possesses at the time a request is made under the
FOIA.

That submission, if correct, is dispositive of the

case -QUESTION:

Is this because, Mr. Alsup, that

material that is not in the possession and control of an
agency cannot by definition be an agency record?

That was

the argument that the government made in the previous case.
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

Correct.
And that Is —
It is a combination — in response

to a comment that Justice Stevens made, I would like to
make it clear that it is because the agency cannot withhold

27
what it doss not possess, and w® also think that the word
"withhold" and made available lends meaning to the words
"agency records.”
QUESTION:

In the previous case, you didn’t

bend at my brother Stevens’ suggestion.

You said that

material that is not in the possession and control of an
agency cannot be an agency record by definition.
MR. ALSUP:

Well —

QUESTION:

Do you take a different position in

MR. ALSUP:

I take the same position, and the

this case?

position is that these words modify each other and that
you have to look at that entire sentence in its totality
to see that what Congress said was that the agency has to
turn over those documents that are under its possession
and control.

That is what it meant by agency record and

that is what it meant by withhold, and we don’t really see
any useful purpose in trying to distinguish between in
parts, the sentence Is very narrow, and say this might be
an agency record but It is not being withheld because it
is
QUESTION:

In the last case, you did see a very

real need for it or you wouldn't have made that argument
unless it felt they needed to.
MR, ALSUP:

Well, we do make the further

28
distinction concerning whether or not a document is a
record under the Federal Recorda Act.
QUESTION:

Well, it used to be a record and it

used to be an agency record, but if it is no longer in
the possession and control of the agency it is not by
definition an agency record.

That xvas the government’s

argument in the previous case.
MR. ALSUP:

Well, with the modification — not

even modification but comments that I have made, we accept
that statement.
QUESTION: He had an alternative.

Your colleague

had an alternative, that they could not be commanded by
anyone to give up the possession of something they didn’t
possess, even assuming it was a record.
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

That is correct.
That was his alternative argument.
I believe that is correct.

Well, our primary submission is dispositive even
if the court were to hold that these secretarial notes
were records under the Federal Records Act, which is an
entirely different scheme, and we think that primary sub­
mission is dispositive and the court doesn't even have to
reach the issue of whether or not it was a record under the
State Department’s records management program.
Contrary to our primary submission, however, the

29

courts below held that the POIA does require an agency to
retrieve those documents it no longer possesses where it
used to be or may still be a record under the Federal Reocrds
Act.
Nows in the event the Court, this Court rejects
our primary submission, we urge the Court to reject the
analysis used by the District Court and the Court of Appeals
concerning what is and is not a record under the Federal
Records Act.

And it is to this question of what is and is

not a record under the Federal Records Act, with the Court's
permission, that I would like to turn.
QUESTION:

May I just ask one question, because I

did think there w&3 a difference in your theory in this case
than in the other.

I thought your argument here was that

even if they were agency records, they had not been with­
held and therefore there was no problem.

But are you taking

the position that they are or are not agency records?
O

■T*tl

MR. ALSUP:
your question.

Now, let me make sure I understand

Are you referring to agency records within

the FOIA or within the Federal Records Act?
QUESTION:

Well, let’s take it in two steps.

First
'

of all, assuming that some of them were unextracted, some of
them are records within the meaning of the Federal Records
Act, would they therefore be records within the meaning of
i

the FOIA even though they are at the Library of Congress?

f

30
MR. ALSUP:

This is a difficult question and I

know we have stumbled over it perhaps but let me answer
it this way:

First, there would be no withholding because

they are
QUESTION:

That is what 1 understood your argu­

ment to be so that is why I am —
MR. ALSUP:

I think that is clear and everyone

agrees we are making that argument.
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

Right.
We also think that the words "with­

holding" and "made available" lend meaning to what Congress
meant by agency record which appears in that same sentence
and therefore it is conceivable that the Court might also
hold that these same documents are not agency records.
QUESTION:
that we might hold.

Well, I know that it is conceivable
I am trying to find out what the

government’s position Is.
that we might hold.

I can think of a lot of things

I am asking you very narrowly and very

specifically, assume that they are records within the mean­
ing of the Federal Records Act, perhaps they are not producable because they are not being withheld.

If they are over

at the Library of Congress and they are records within the
meaning of the Federal Records Act, are they or are they
.not In the government's view records within the meaning of
the FOIA?

31
MR- ALSUP:

All right.

If they are records withi»

the meaning of the Federal Records Act* they remain federal
records within the meaning of the Federal Records Act even
though they are at the Library of Congress.
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

Now, that —

That doesn’t answer my question.
I know.

Your question is whether or

not they are agency records within the meaning of the FOIA.
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

Yes.
I have to say that I think that our

argument is that they are not records within the meaning of
the FOIA even though I don’t think the Court needs to reach
that issue because of the clear availability of the word
"withhold."
QUESTION:

Then why do you make all of this argu­

ment about the Federal Records Act?
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

Well, because —
That whole argument is completely un­

necessary to your position.
MR. ALSUP:

I disagree with that.

The court below

found it very important that these were records within the
meaning of the Federal Records Act.
QUESTION:

If we accept the argument of the United

States government made in the previous case that as a matter
of definition under the FOIA nothing can be an agency record
that Is not in the possession and control of the agency, then’

32
that is the end of this ease3 isn’t it?
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And that is the very argument that the

government made In the last case and you are shying away from
it in this case.
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

Oh, no, absolutely not.
Then why didn’t you just answer that ~

MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

Well, I think I —
— it would be easy, whether they ever

were records or whether they are still records for purposes
of the Records Act, they are not for purposes of the POIA
because they are not in the possession and control of the —
MR. ALSUP:

Well, if I may, we clearly argue --

and I think I haven’t said this very well, but we are clearly
taking the position that whether or not it Is a record under
the Federal Records Act or under Justice Stevens9 possibility
that agency records mean something special in the FOIA, if
the agency does not have possession and control -- wait, let
me finish this — if the agency doesn't have possession and
control, there Is no violation of the FOIA.

Possession and

control is an essential requirement before the agency Is re­
quired to produce under the FOIA.
QUESTION:
separate reasons.

Yes, but that could be for fcvro quite
One Is there could be no withholding or,

two, it could be because they are not agency records, and

33
you keep muddling them.
MR. ALSUP:

Wells I don*t think I ara able to give

much clearer answer than what I have.

As I understand our

argument, first there would be no withholding.
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

Right.
And you agree with that.

Second, It

may or may not be agency records, we don’t think it is
necessary — under the POIA *— we donft think it is necessary
to determine that issue.
QUESTION:

But you are saying that issue does not

depend on whether or not they are records within the meaning j
of the Federal Records Act, and yet you have argued at great
length the meaning of the Federal Records Act, as though —~
and I had the impression from your brief that that would be
dispositive in this case on the issue of whether or not they
were records within the meaning of the POIA, but apparently
I was wrong.
MR. ALSUP:

No.

We believe that an agency is re­

quired to produce under the POIA any document which is a
record under the Federal Records Act and is in its possession
and control.

Now, let*s go over those three elements.

record under the FRA, possession and control.

A

If any of

those three are missing, then the agency does not have to
produce it and there is no withholding.
Now, it Is a separate question and a nice question,;

i

3**

bufc we think a theoretical question as to whether or not
agency record means something, that if it is not in its
possession and control it continues to be an agency record,
and I think where I haven’t been very clear is I am simply
saying I don't think that is necessarily an issue in this
case; whether a document is a record under the Federal
Records Act, however, is an issue in this case.
QUESTION:

When your colleague in the previous

case argued that it wasn’t an agency record because it xvasn’t
in possession and control, so let’s forget this no withhold­
ing business or at least just use the withholding to shed
light on what is in an agency reeord.
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

Well —
That is what Mr. Geller said but his

bottom line was that this is not an agency record for FOIA
purposes.

That was his bottom line.
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

Well —

j

Yours is -- you say now we don’t even

have to think about whether it is an agency r-ecord if you
are not withholding it.
QUESTION:

Well, there is nothing inconsistent be-

tween those two positions, between saying (a) I choose to
answer it, and (b) you don’t have to answer it.
MR. ALSUP:

That’s correct, it is not inconsistent.

I understood Mr. Geller to say that you don’t have to make a

i

35
distinction between what is and is not an agency record be­
cause the words "withhold" and "made available" in agency
records should all be read together.
QUESTION:

He certainly suggested to us that if we

agreed with him, we should approach the case and the words
you use would be talking about what is an agency record and
your conclusion would be, if you agreed with him, this is not
an agency record.

That was his submission.

MR. ALSUP:

Well, I don't disagree with that sub­

mission .
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

Good.
Well, with the Court's permission, I

would like to address the question of whether or not these
were or were not records under the Federal Records Act be­
cause that was the question xthleh x*as of great concern in
the courts below and they concluded that they were records
under the Federal Records Act.
We think that the District Court made a fundamental
error in deciding for itself

what is and Is not a record

under the Federal Records Act and it —
QUESTION:

That is 44 U.S.C. 3301, on page 5 of

your brief?
MR. ALSUP:

That’s correct.

That was first enacted

in the Records Disposal Act, that same definition, that was
in 1943, that

same definition was then incorporated into the

36
Federal Records Act in 1950.
QUESTION:

Mr. Alsup, we have interrupted you a

great deal and I hesitate to do it again, but just to aid my
undQ^standing of your argument, we do not reach this issue
if we accept your first argument, is that correct?
MR. ALSUP:

That's correct.

In fact, the Court

could simply hold that the Act does not reach documents
which are not in the possession of the agency —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. ALSUP:
case.

— and that would be the end of the

Now, this secondary issue would only be reached in

the event the Court were to say there is a duty to retrieve
documents which are records under the Federal Records Act.
The definition under

33,

section 3301 defines a

record to be one which is preserved among other things and
only to be those things which are preserved or appropriate
for preservation as evidence of the organization, functions,
policies, decisions, procedures, operations or other activi­
ties of the government.
We think the words "appropriate for preservation”
there is the key.

The District Court underscored that

language in its opinion, indicating that it felt that these
notes were appropriate for preservation.

We think that the

legislative history of that seetion makes it clear that it's
the agency, not the courts, xihieh makes the decision whether

37
or not something is appropriate for preservation as a record.
Under the Federal Records Act, the scheme that is
contemplated is that agencies will adopt records management
programs and they will make the decision in the first in­
stance whether some material should or should not become an
agency record and therebyr — or federal record and thereby
subject to the strictures of the Records Disposal Act which
prohibit any disposal of such a record without the approval
of the archivist.
On the other hand, if it is not designated as a
record, it remains non-record material, and even though that
is the property of the United States in our view, it is not
a federal record.
Now, we believe that the District Court and the
courts below disregarded this approach to the act by simply
assuming that these documents were records under the Federal
Records Act -without making an inquiry into the State Depart­
ment’s regulations to determine whether or not the agency
itself had classified them as records on the one hand or
non-record materials on the other.
We do agree, however, with the District Court that
these documents, when they were created, were not the per­
sonal property of Dr. Kissinger but were the property of the
agency.

They may have been non-record material or they may

have been records, but the agency would make that determination

38
by applying its records management program.
If we accept that analysis of the Federal Records
Act, we believe that a remand to the District Court would be
necessary in order to determine whether or not these ©articu­
lar notes were or were not non-record material or were or
were not, to put it conversely, records under the Federal
Records Act.
QUESTION:

What would make them property, the fact

that government employees and government materials went into
their construction?
NR. ALSUP:

Not principally.

The principle deter­

minant under the cases that we have cited in our brief is
'

whether or not they were prepared within the scope of employ­
ment of the employee, and here that clearly was the case.
These were — with the possible exception of those notes
!
■

that have nothing to do with the State Department's business,
the bulk of these would have been clearly prepared in the
i

scope of Dr. Kissinger's employment and that would have made
them the property of the United States.
QUESTION:

Well, it is said that Mr. Truman, when

he was President, dictated every night a diary of the day's
events.

|

he frequently referred back to these things with respect to
conversations he had had with Cabinet officers or various

With respect to the question of whether

were the property of the agency.

QUESTION:

I understood you to say that you thought

the agency should make this decision rather than the courts.

MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
And the agency in this ease certainly

through its legal adviser seems already to have made it.
So by virtue of what right does the Solicitor General say
that it thinks the agency decision is incorrect?
MR. ALSUP:

QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

Let’s say —
Let’s take this case.
Well, I think I can answer that by

saying what if Dr. Kissinger had given all of the records of
the State Department to the Library of Congress.

Well,

clearly in a case like that, even If the legal adviser had
somehow approved that, the State Department would want to
bring a retrieval action and say we have changed our mind,
the legal adviser no longer believes that these were the
personal property of Dr. Kissinger but rather that these
were the property of the agency itself.

We do believe that

the agency itself can change its mind and go after '—
QUESTION:
this case?

Well, what about this case?

How about

As I understand, the State Department doesn’t

want these records.
MR. ALSUP:

So far as this record discloses, the

State Department has not made a final determination whether
to bring a retrieval action for the recovery of the notes,
that is correct.

k2
QUESTION:

Well, has it asked for them back?

MR. ALSUP:

It has not asked for them back.

In the

record there is an agreement —
QUESTION:

Well, I will put it this i<ray:

Do you

think that you are representing the views of the State Depart~

j

ment?

MR. ALSUP:

Yes.
*

QUESTION:

Which means that the State Department

through you Is asking that these notes be reviewed in the
hands of the Library of Congress to see if they have been
fully extracted?
MR. ALSUP:

No*

No.

The procedure that now is
\

outstanding Is that there Is an agreement with Dr. Kissinger
and the federal parties that allows a sampling of these
documents to be undertaken for the State Department to make
a determination of whether It believes some of these are or
are not records.

When that is completed, if the State

Department has decided that these were records under the
records management program, at that time it would take ap­
propriate action to seek the
QUESTION:

return ~

Seek the return or just get them ex~

tracted?
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

Well, it might have either alternative.
What is your position on that?
The State Department specifically would

43
like to reserve both possibilities and we don’t take a posi­
tion in this case as to whether or not these are or are not
records.
QUESTION:

Well, I think it is rather important
■
•

•

that you take a position for purposes of the Freedom of In­
formation Act.

If all the State Department is interested in

'

is making sure they have been properly extracted and that the
official business is taken out of them, they have copies of
t

it.

That doesn’t mean that all of the papers need to be re­

turned, does it?
MR. ALSUP:

r- 1
j!

That is correct.

;i

QUESTION:

Because I take it your position is that

once they get back to the State Department they are FOIA
papers.
HR. ALSUP:

Once they were back in their possession

then —
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUP:

Yes or no?
That’s correct.

Once they are back in

the possession of the -QUESTION:

I think it makes quite a difference on

what position you take for purposes of this lawsuit.
MR. ALSUP:

Mr. Justice, the problem is this:

The

State Department does not know what these documents look like,;
.

They have not seen but a limited sample, and it is simply not
in a position at this point to draw a conclusion which would

44
would reverse the position that the legal adviser took.
QUESTION:
\

I know, but there is always

if they

want a sample of them and they do sample them, which they are j
now doing, and they decide that they should be reviewed and
further extracts made, they can do that — perhaps they can
do that, but does that mean they have to have the papers returned to them?
:

FTR. ALSUP:

Not necessarily.

It might be done at

the Library of Congress.
ii'

QUESTION:

In which event they never would be POIA

papers except to the extent they were extracted.

»

MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

That Is correct.
You referred to these negotiations that

'

are going on, discussions or whatever terra you want to use.
MR. ALSUP:
f r.

Well, at the time of the District

Court's order, an agreement was filed with the court which

iW

advised the court that the federal parties were making an In­
spection of a limited sample of the notes at the Library of
Congress and that they therefore would make a decision at
some point in the future when that review was completed as to
whether or not the State Department felt that any of these
were records and therefore would seek their return.
QUESTION:

Is It possible that will dispose of the

issues in this case?

i

FIR. ALSUP:

It 'would not dispose of it„

Even If

the State Department were to say that they wanted some small
.

percentage of the documents back, we are convinced that the
plaintiffs in this case would insist on full return, it
would not dispose of the case,
QUESTION:

Mr, Alsup, I just want to make one thing

— call one thing to your attention.

At page 21 of your

brief, you said, "We agree with the courts

below that the

QUESTION:

No, no, it isn’t qualified in your brief.

You say unequivocally, because you argued no withholding

with the courts below that the FOIA applies to at least all
records within the meaning of

I don't think that is a fair construc­
for this reason.

now suggests we should.

QUESTION:

You really want to withdraw this conces-

slon, in other words?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Dobrovir.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. DOBROVIR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE MILITARY AUDIT PROJECT

•c

MR. DOBROVIR:
i

-

l

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please|
•

47
the Court:
In this case, the Secretary of State chose to record
and communicate to his aides in the conduct of his office in
part by causing the preparation of verbatim transcripts of
his business telephone conversations.

The issue is whether

public rights under the Freedom of Information Act can be
defeated by the Secretary’s removal of these documents from
;

the State Department building prior to his departure from
office.
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps the first question is

whether there is a private cause of action available here.
Will you address that at some point?
MR. DOBROVIR:

I will address it now in response to

i

your question, Mr. Chief Justice.
When the State Department denied the records on
January 18 — and that is a date which I ask the Court to
remember — it said we deny access to these records on the
.

grounds that they are not agency records because they were
personal records and also on the ground that they are no
!

longer in the possession of the department, they are in the
Library of Congress.

That denial we submit -— and I will

present our theory with respect to that — was a withholding
I

within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act.

On

that basis, there was a cause of action, a cause of action
arose under the Freedom of Information Act

i

H8
QUESTION:

Well, surely at that time the Attorney

General of the United States, acting independently, or the
Administrator of GSA, operating independentlys perhaps could
have commenced a lawsuit.
MR. DOBROVIR:

Do you agree with that?
Could have.

Indeed, as the record

reflects, the Archivist of the United States on January 18,
the same date that the State Department denied access to the
records, was also denied by Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, acting as Secretary of State, access to the
records to inspect them for the purpose of determining
t

whether or not they were records that ought to remain within
the government's record system.
QUESTION:

The Archivist is a subordinate of the

Administrator of GSA, is he not?
MR. DOBROVIR:

Yes, he is.

We assume he was act­

ing within the authority granted him by his superiors.

The

point is that the Secretary of State categorically denied
him access to these records, claiming that they were personal
records.
I will argue the question of the District Court's
power and the question of the cause of action.

Mr. Sussman

will argue the question of whether the records are agency
records.

I would only say here that we agree with the con­

cession made by the Solicitor General that they were agency
records In their inception.

We disagree with him when he

says that they could at a later date or did at a later date
not become — lose that character as agency records.
I

5

I refer to January 18 and I told the Court what
happened on that date.

j

The petitioner was still the

Secretary of State on January 18, and it was in his capacity
as Secretary of State that the department under hi3 supert

vision, under his supervision by statute, denied access to
these records.

The denials were based on the claim that
■

they were his personal property.

His refusal of access to

the Archivist was based on the claim that they were his

personal property.
J

QUESTION:

You said there was an additional basis,

MR. DOBROVIR:
was the only basis.

i

With respect to the Archivist, that

With respect to the Freedom of Informa­

tion request, the additional basis was that he had already
transmitted them to the Library of Congress.
We start with the proposition that when a federal
government official acts in performing the duties of his
office, he is presumed to act for the agency.

The petitioner .

was Secretary of State and was not acting a3 a private in­
dividual when everything at issue here occurred.

He created

the records when he caused them to be written down, when he
preserved them, and he preserved them as he thought they
were appropriate for preservation and in so doing I think he
was acting for the agency of which he was the agent and for

50

I
which he was a fiduciary.
It was as Secretary of State that the agency denied
the first Freedom of Information request for these documents,
and it was as Secretary of State that he by statute had
custody of the department's records, that prima facie these
records were State Department records at all times that he
was Secretary of State and insofar as he purported to transfer’
them to the Library of Congress, they remained nevertheless
the property of the Department of State through the construe- |
tlve possession — a phrased used by Nr. Geller earlier in
the Forsham case, the government accepts constructive
possession — through the constructive possession of
Secretary Kissinger.
Accordingly, very simply, these documents remained
i

in the possession and in the control of the Department of
State at the time when both Freedom of Information requests
were filed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dobrovir, suppose I am Secretary of |

State and X have a file in my office in which I keep copies
of correspondence to personal friends which I have written
saying, no, I can't come out and visit you this week but
maybe two weeks from now, and it is separate from State
Department record transactions and other things.

Are those

FOIA records?
MR. D0BR0YIR:

No, sir, those are personal records,

51
by your description of them»

By the description of these

records, however, as the Solicitor General

3ays,

they were

agency records and all flows from that in our view.
The conversations, after all, were not held with
Mrs. Kissinger, they were held with Presidents, they were
held with foreign ambassadors, they were held with other
officials of the department.

They were circulated to Dr.

Kissinger’s immediate aides, as Dr. Kissinger’s lawyer here
has told us, for the purpose of implementing and following
up the determinations.

There is no way in which these could

be anything other than agency records.
Now, our position is that as Secretary of State,
Henry Kissinger had a duty to his principal, the Department
of State, not to prefer his own personal interests to his
principal’s interests.

He was aware from the very beginning,

from January of 1976, when the first Freedom of Information
Act for any of the records, those in that case White House
records, was submitted.

There was a question as to whether

or not these documents were agency records or were personal
files.

Nevertheless, he made the determination, a determin­

ation which we submit was in conflict with the interest, an
interest he was aware of, of the agency that they were his
records and not the agency's records.
QUESTION:

Well, there are a lot of presidential

libraries that are in trouble, aren’t there?

MR. DOBROVIR;

sidered a different animal.
care of those problems.

We now have statutes that take

The Presidential Materials Act of

1978 will now regulate the question of Presidential records.
This Court now has to determine the status of records of
agency heads, Cabinet officers, because this is a unique kind
of case.

i

A subordinate official would not be in the position
<

that the Secretary of State was in to make the determination
on his own.

A subordinate official w'ould have had to have
■

submitted to all the normal procedures that the Department
of State has in order to get a determination that the records
were personal records and not State Department records.

Dr.

Kissinger -•»
QUESTION:

Mr. Dobrovir, you are down to a little

more than one minute and we haven’t heard very much about
the private cause of action, at least I haven't.
MR. DOBROVIR:

Well, it is as simple as this:

The

documents were denied, the denial of documents creates a
private cause of action because it is in the circumstances of
this case a withholding.

The government makes a very tech­

nical argument that the documents are not in the possession
of the agency, there is no withholding.

Here the possession

of Dr. Kissinger, the right of acce?ss, the right to exclude
others from aecess by normal definitions of possession was

53
the possession of the Department of State.

There wa3 there­

fore in our view a vrithholding and therefore there was a
cause of action, like any cause of action.
QUESTION:

Do you think this situation meets the

criterion of something enacted especially for the particular
class of people seeking the information?
MR. DOBROVIR:

No, the statute was enacted for the

benefit of the public at large, anyone, any person, they
need not be a citizen of the United States, has a right to
seek access under the Freedom of Information Act, and every­
thing that happened here created that cause of action. .
I believe I have used up my time.
QUESTION:

May I just clarify one thing.

You don’t

argue at all that there is a private cause of action under
the Federal Records Act, you merely claim that your rights
under the FOIA give you the right to bring this action?
MR. DOBROVIR:

That’s right, Mr. Justice Stevens.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. SUSSMAN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE REPORTERS COMMITTEE FOR
GREEDOM OF THE PRESS
MR. SUSSMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to if I may return to the threshold
issue in this case, the question of whether documents which

i
5*»

were agency records at the time of their removal and were
so we argue removed unlawfully, are agency records within
I

the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act and therefore
are subject to judicial relief within the terms of that act.
It is true that we are here before the Court today
not under the Federal Recorda Act.

We believe that is a

statute for the government to enforce.

We are here instead

under the Freedom of Information Act, a statute which
.

creates right on behalf of private citizens who seek to ob­
tain records of the United States government.
Our primary submission, and a submission which we
believe controls the resolution of this case, is that if the
transcripts were removed unlawfully from the Department of
State, they remain records.

On the other hand, we believe

that if the transcripts were removed lawfully pursuant to
statutes and regulations, they lost their record statute
status and the act ceases to apply.
.

I think we have to start with the text of the

QUESTION:

i

The relevant test i3 not whether or not

they were records but whether or not they were "agency

You would agree with that, wouldn’t you?
MR. SUSSMAN:

That is absolutely true, although we

do argue that —
;

QUESTION:

Your argument Is the same, that they were

55
agency records and remained agency records if they were
wrongfully removed from the agency?
MR. SUSSMAN:
QUESTION:

That is absolutely our argument.

That is your argument.

MR. SUSSMAN:

Our argument is that the act on its

face applies to agency records.

If the document has been

unlawfully removed, it preserves its legal status as an agency
.

record, therefore it is within the coverage of the act.

I

think it is significant that Congress in enacting the Freedom
of Information Act specified nine exemptions and defined
them very clearly for determining when documents which fit
the definition of records could not be produced by federal
agencies.

It did not — and I think this is very key

it

.

did not create an exemption for documents which are agency
records in every respect but happened not to be in the
physical custody of the agency.
QUESTION:

Well, what if one makes a demand on an

agency for a record which doesn't fall wLthin any of the
exemptions but which was destroyed lawfully under the Federal
Records Act?
MR. SUSSMAN:

Then I think the act no longer ap­

— and I think this is an important

The agency does not have unlawfully removed records

in a sense that those records are in Its physical possession.
That is to say, the State Department could not go down to
the basement of the Department of State and get these tran­

(Si.

scripts.

However, there Is another plane on which we can

approach the problem, and we can think of possession not
merely as phycial possession but as legal possession, and we

57
would submit that an agency certainly has what it owns and
its ovmership rights certainly do not turn on the physical
location where records are kept.
We would say — and I think this case illustrates
it quite plainly — that if an agency owns a document, it has
:

a legal right to reduce that document to possession at any
time.

It is the owner of the document, therefore it has the

.
t

means of producing the document under the Freedom of Information Act and it can provide it.

And I think this case illus- i

trates that perfectly.
Mr. Kissinger was Secretary of State at the time
the Freedom of Information Act requests were made, therefore

|

he had it well within his means and power to produce these
documents if in fact they were owned by the department.
Even after Mr. Kissinger was Secretary of State, I think you
had exactly the same situation.
QUESTION:

The department

On the 18th of January they were already

in the possession of the Library of Congress, were they not?
MR. SUSSMAN:

They were already in the possession

of the Library of Congress, that’s true.
QUESTION:

Well, if he demanded their return, could:
■

he secure their return in his individual capacity after he
had made the gift which the government says is an irrevocable
gift, or Mr. Ginsburg did?
MR. SUSSMAN:

I think. Your Honor, he could have

58
done It in either capacity, as Secretary of State he could
have said to the Library of Congress, I have now reexamined
the law, I have been advised by those who have construed the
Federal Records Act that these documents were not my personal
property, therefore I had no authority to remove them and
therefore I had no authority to donate them to you, and I
think they ought to be returned.
QUESTION:

Well, is that a fact, that someone did

advise him that they were no longer —
MR. SUSSMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, nobody —

The facts are just the contrary, aren’t

they?
MR. SUSSMAN:

Well, he was advised by the legal

adviser that they were not, but I think the question we are
looking at right now is the question of withholding and the
question of whether an unlawfully removed document is within
the power of an agency to retrieve.

And my point is that

it would have been very simple for Mr. Kissinger, assuming,
contrary to the facts, that he did conclude, reassess his
opinion, decide that these documents were indeed records,
it would have been very simple for him in his capacity as
Secretary of State to go down to the Library of Congress
and say these are department records, a request for them
has been made under the Freedom of Information Act, my deed
of gift to you I believe is superseded by that, I would like

59

And If the only way it can get the

records is to win a lawsuit, first convince the Attorney

General to sue and then to win it, are they withholding
records now?
MR. SUSSMAN:

I think that the State Department is

withholding records if it has failed to take all steps within
its power to procure the return of those records.
QUESTION:

So on that basis if you win, what is

the judgment?
MR. SUSSMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, the judgment —

What is the order, turn them over?

MR. SUSSMAN:

The judgment I think is precisely

the judgment entered by the court below and that is an order
to the State Department to go out and to repossess from the
Library of Congress to the extent the library is willing to
provide the documents and the transcripts.
QUESTION:

If you were the adviser of the State

■

Department, how would you proceed, go across the street and
ask them for them?
MR. SUSSMAN:
QUESTION:

That is exactly what I would do.

And if the library said we're awfully

sorry, then you would go to the Attorney General?
MR. SUSSMAN:

I would certainly do that and I

would do that not only under the Freedom of Information Act.
I would do that under the Records Act itself because the
•

f

Records Act imposes a mandatory duty on the part of an agency
to retrieve unlawfully removed records.

QUESTION:

The Attorney General is the enforcer of

that and there have been all sorts of cases deciding what is
or is not owned by a person.

Isn’t that ultimately left to

the judgment of the Attorney General3 whether a record has
been unlawfully removed?
MR. SUSSMAN:

If there are no Freedom of Informa­

tion Act requesters, the issue is left to the Attorney
General, but if —
QUESTION:

Well, why should that make any differ­

ence?
MR. SUSSMAN:

Well, it should make a difference

for this reason, that independent of what is or is not done,
under the records statute, citizens have a private cause of
action under the FOIA to obtain records, and we submit that
that cause of action, the records which are covered by the
act and are not within the exemptions, that cause of
action should not and cannot be conditioned on whether the
Attorney General does or does not choose to exercise his
prosecutorial discretion.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting that an FOIA suit

could be used to secure judicial review of every single de­
cision by an agency to dispose of a non-record record once
it thinks that it has served its purposes.

All you would

have to do Is file an action and say that they made a
nflsfcake and they were dead-wrong in deciding that this

63
document has served its purposes and that the officer may
take it away with him.
MR. SUSSMAN:

Let me say that 1 think that 9*9999

of every 10,000 such suits tfould be frivolous because it
would be very clear that the record-keeping decision of the
agency was a lawful one and that the documents were worth­
less.
QUESTION:

So your answer is yes, that is exactly

what an FOIA case could be used for?
MR. SUSSMAN:

That's right, but I don't think that

that is a result that we ought to be fearful of or concerned
about because there is a very clear and very comprehensive
statutory framework for removing documents from public to
private property --QUESTION:

And for retrieving them?
!

MR. SUSSMAN:

And for retrieving them, but I come

back to the point I made before and that is that we are
not only concerned in this case with the government's record­
keeping decisions under the records statutes, vre are con­
cerned with the rights of the public under the Freedom of
Information Act, and what we are asking from the Court is
to recognise the remedy that an FOIA requester has when a
document otherwise subject to the act has been unlawfully
removed from agency custody, and we submit that the FOIA is
a free-standing statute, and if a document which is •

64
otherwise a record has been removed from agency custody un­
lawfully, then we don’t believe that a prosecutorial dis­
cretion decision by the Attorney General or the agency head
can cut off the public’s rights under the act.

And it is

MR. SUSSMAN:

I don’t think that we are talking

about administrative remedy because the administrative remedy

FOIA is a request to the agency to produce with­

held records.

That is the only administrative remedy that

the act provides, and that is what we did.

We went to the

State Department and we said we would like to see the

QUESTION:

Was any request ever made of the

Attorney General to get into this matter that you are aware
of?
MR. SUSSMAN:

Not by the POIA requesters, and I

can’t speak with absolute authority about the State Depart­
ment.

I believe that it also never made a request.
QUESTION:

Nor GSA?

MR. SUSSMAN:

GSA I don’t believe has also asked

the Attorney General to bring suit, although it should be —
QUESTION:

Of course, I suppose that the Depart­

ment of Justice, which is headed by the Attorney General,
has a position in this lawsuit that is directly contrary to
yours that this isn't an POIA -- that this isn’t any longer
the business of an POIA lawsuit in the posture of this case.
MR. SUSSMAN:

That is indeed their position and I

would submit that if there were a Judicially created duty
on the part of the State Department to seek the return of
these records, the Justice Department might be somewhat
more sympathetic to our problem.
The one Issue that I have not discussed is the
question of whether these documents are records.

1 will try

to be very brief about it and simply say that we think the
issue turns on, first, the Federal Records Act themselves
and, secondly, GSA regulations, because GSA is the agency

66
that Congress has selected to implement the records statute,
and, third. State Department regulations, and as we have
demonstrated in our briefs, we think that these transcripts
are plainly, very plainly records under all three bodies of
law.
I believe my time is up —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. SUSSMAN:

It is not?

No, not yet.
Okay.

happy to continue a little while longer.

Well, I would be
Let me turn first

to the definition of records in the records statute.
We have a rather fundamental and direct quarrel
with both the government and with Mr. Kissinger on that
point.

They make the argument that individual agencies have

broad discretion under the Records Acts to determine when
documents coricededly relating to public business are records
and when they are non-records.
We don't think that it is logical or sensible to
adopt that reading of the records statute.
this:

Our reason is

The records statute contains a very detailed, a very

specific procedure for transferring documents relating to
public business from public to private custody,

The agency

must list those documents on a schedule, submit

it to the

Archivist, and it must determine before it lists those
documents on the schedule that the documents have no longer
use for the current transaction of government business and

67
they have no long-term value either to other agencies of the
government, to the government as a whole or to the general
public.
Now, the interpretation of the Records Act proposed
ii

by the government would allow an individual agency by the
simple expedient of classifying a document as a non-record
material to exclude it entirely from the archival process,
In which case the careful, detailed uniform and consistent
scheme adopted by Congress for making achival decisions

ii

il

would be bypassed completely.
With that, I would like to close.

I think that

that is a compelling reason in and of itself uhj the inter­
pretation of the act offered by the government should not be
accepted.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID GINSBURG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF KISSINGER — REBUTTAL
MR. GINSBURG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Military Audit Project counsel said that the
Solicitor General had conceded that these notes were agency
records in their inception.

This is an issue to which

Justice White addressed himself earlier.

I simply wish to

68
correct the record.

The Solicitor General can speak for him­

self, but he said that they v/ould be regarded as non-record
materials.
I make the simple point that if they are non­
record materials, then of course they are not subject to the
Freedom of Information Act which applies only to records.
This is a problem that has to do with the Federal Records
Act and not with the Freedom of Information Act.
Now, the Implications of the argument that the
Court has just heard from the Reporters Committee should be
clearly understood.

The first, that the claim is that the

Freedom of Information Act can be used not only to obtain
records in the custody and the possession and the control
of an agency, but as a basis for requiring the return to an
agency of materials that it had relinquished before the
request was made,
QUESTION:

Do you think there would be a differ­

ence possibly, Mr. Ginsburg, between the authority of the
Attorney General to pursue records and retrieve them by
replevin and the obligation of the State Department to deal
under the act with records of papers that they no longer
possess?
MR. GINSBURG:

I think there is no doubt that if

the Attorney General’s authority was invoked under the
Federal Records Act and the claim was both by the

69
Administrator of General Services and the Attorney General
and the Secretary of State referring the issue to the Attorney
General, he has plenary power under the Federal Records Act
to pursue the matter.

That is a problem of ownership, the

problem of whether it Is

initially a record is simply a
>

different matter and a different statute.
QUESTION:

And that would still leave to be decided

whether, assuming they were owned by the State Department
and therefore properly back in State’s possession, whether
they were agency records under the FOIA.
MR. GINSBURG:

That would still leave that issue

to be determined. Your Honor.

In this case, it is clear

that these were never records and were never treated as
records, but the implication is one that we would be able to
■

use this statute as a basis for requiring the return of
material that has already been relinquished, it would be
required as a bsis to obtain materials which an agency had
determined were not its records, it would mean that private

i
j

Attorneys General would now be implied under the Freedom of
Information Act so as to supplement in a sense the activi*»
■

■

ties of the Attorney General under the Federal Records Act,
i

and finally it xwuld also mean, if this approach to the
i

Freedom of Information Act were taken, that private citizens
'

might be able to use the Freedom of Information Act not only
against agencies of the United States but also against

TO
private citizens and also against institutions that were not
agencies under the Freedom of Information Act.
Thank you.
QUESTION;

Mr. Ginsburg, is it correct under your

submission that -- say, an agency became aware of an impend­
ing FOIA request before it was filed, that the person who
had custody of all the records that might be the subject of
the request could simply take them home and keep them until
after the request had been filed and then they would avoid
complianceo

MR. GINSBURG:

Your Honor, it seems to me that the

only possible remedy that could be invoked — this is an
issue conceivably for amendment of the statute — but the

of your position,

I think you have agreed with me that in
■V •

the case I pose if someone aware of a pending request takes
all of the documents heme and keeps them in his basement,
that there would be no FQIA claim against that agency?
MR. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

That is my view, sir,

All right.

MR. GINSBURG:

Thank you,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case Is submitted,
(Whereupon, at 2:31 o’clock p«ni.s the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
