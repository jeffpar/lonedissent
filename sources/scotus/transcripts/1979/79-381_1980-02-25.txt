PROCEEDINGS
MRe. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Weng.ler v. Druggists

Mutual Insurance Company.
Mr. Reid, you may begin whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W„ REID, II, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. REID: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
The question presented in this particular case is
whether the 1976 Revised Statutes of Missouri Section 287.240
which authorizes worker's compensation death benefits for the
spouse of a male worker without regard to depancy but conditions
benefits for the spouse of a female worker upon mental and
physical incapacity or proof of dependency discriminates
impermissibly on the basis of gender in violation of the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the
United States Question.
This case arose at the death of Ruth Wengler on
February 11, 1977.

Thereafter a workman compensation claim

was filed by the claimant for the death of his wife.

The

referee and the Industrial Commission of the State of Missouri
held that they did not have the authority to declare a. Missouri
statute provision on the dea;h benefits unconstitutional and
therefore disallowed the claim.
The claim was appealed to the Circuit Court of

4

Madison County where the Circuit Judge there held that dtse to
the Missouri Constitution and the Federal Constitution the
Equal Protection Clause, the death benefits to the workman
compensation for Paul Wengler had been denied and therefore
ruled in favor of the claimant and indicated that the benefits
should be applied to Mr. Wengler for the death of his wife.
Thereafter Druggists Mutual appealed this decision
to the Missouri Suprema Court and there in a divided opinion
the Missouri Supreme Court reversed the Circuit Court of
Madison County, holding that they xtfouid not apply the strict
scrutiny test as it had boon applied by members of this Court
in appropriate sex discrimination cases but instead applied the
other test that have been applied, the substantial relation
test.

And. held that under the substantial relation test that

Equal Protection Clause had not been violated by the Missouri
workman compensation benefit statute.
But Justice Donnelly in a concurring opinion
basically indicated that ha was troubled because he didn't know
what the supreme law of the land was and Justice sielar

his

opinion — which was a dissenting opinion, the sole dissenting
opinion -- pointed out that the majority opinion even though
it applied the substantial relation test that the --- in his
opinion that this Court would have found that the Missouri
workman

compensation death benefit violated the Equal

Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of this

Constitution.

And pointing out that members of this Court

had applied the substantial relation test and therefore the
substantial relations test and the strict scrutiny test both
would not pass the Missouri workman compensation death benefit
a.3 it applied in the Stats of Missouri in the Wengler case.
And the dissenting opinion was held in favor of the claimant.
After this case was accepted and briefs started
being written, we,received a telephone call from the Department
of Justice and also the American Civil Liberties Union and
they both filed amicus curiae briefs on behalf of th® claimant.
And X thought that this was very strange when I received the
phone call from the Department of Justice, because the American
Civil Liberties Union and the Department of Justice had bean
litigating these matters before this Court in the Social
Security cases, Federal cases.

And after obtaining the amicus

curiae brief from the Department of Justice I found out that
v;hat happened after the Goldfarb cases, the Social Security
case which was a 5-4 decision, that Congress thereafter
instructed the Department of Justice to go through the Social
Security laws and to advise Congress how the gender
discrimination in the Social Security law coi^ld be corrected.
And according to the brief of the Department of Justice they
have complied with that public law which is on page 3 of the
amicus curiae's brief and in February 1979 they had made a
report back to Congress of how the gender-based discrimination

6

can be corrected by Congress.
So that I think this is an expression by Congress
that they want to correct the gender-based discrimination
that still is in the Social Security laws.
QUESTIONs

Did Congress do anything in response to

that, report?
MS. REID:

Justice Relinquish* I think that this

report took place in February of 1979 and to my knowledge,
and what 1' have is from the amicus curiae brief, Congress
has not passed any law at this time.
I think that it is the claimant's position that
the Missouri majority misread and misapplied the tests that
have been applied by this Court.

Arid to be quite fair with

the Missouri Supreme Court, there were soma cases that came
down about the same time as the Missouri decision last term,
this Court, the Orr case and also the Westcott case.

And in

those cases the plurality of the Court held that the alimony
statute of the State of Alabama violated the Equal Protection
Clause and also a portion of the Federal statute on aid to
dependent children, also violated the Equal Protection Clause
where it only applied benefits to the father who was unemployed
and not to a ' mother that was unemployed.
I think the American Civil Liberties Union —
of course I have a client and not a cause

the American

Civil Liberties Union would like to see the Court adopt the

7

striet scrutiny test.

Quit© frankly I don't believe that

the decisions of this Court in the last decade would
have been any different if the strict, scrutiny test which
Justice Brennan has written about in many decisions in 1S70
would have been applied by the Court.

The Court has held in

the Kahn case, the decision written by Justice Douglas,
that in the area of taxation that the Constitution and this
Court has given States great leeway and this is a particular
area where they have done.

And X think that under that

particular decision that applying the strict scrutiny teat
that that decision would stand.
The Schlesinger v. Ballard ease involved a decision
involving up and out of the Armed Forces.

A member of the

Armc d Forces who was an officer had to move up or be booted
out of the service and this Court held, the plurality, that
in that particular case that the Constitution gave to Congress
the authority to man the services and that this was of germane
purpose and that the Court would not use the Equal Protection
Clause to take away that duty and that power that is delegated
to Congress.
In Califano v. Webster which was a pro curiam
decision of this. Court end there was a provision of the Social
Security Act which gave benefits to a woman by deducting
three years off of her earnings requirements for benefits
that this was a specific Act of Congress to do away with some

8

past discrimination that women had been shackled with over the
many years.
QUESTION:

Mr. Reid, do you think the Missouri

statute discriminates against men or against women?
MR„ REID:
Justice Stevens.

I think it discriminates against both,

I think it discriminates against a working

woman and I think perhaps a few decades ago it was the place
for the woman to remain in, tha home and take care of the
children.

Today, with inflation, with our way of lif, a

number- of women work outside the home and raise the family.
And so by denying the workman compensation benefits it does
discriminate against not only males but also females.
QUESTION:

It doesn’t deny any women the benefits

in this case, does it?
ME« REID:

It does deny her family benefits.

In

the event she would pass away, her family would be discriminated
against; whereas if the husband passed away, she would be
entitled to benefits for her and the children.

But she, on the

other foot, if the wife passes away -- the mother -- then the
father has a void there.
QUESTION:

We are talking members of the family other

than the spouse, aren’t they treated alike, aren’t the children
treated as dependants in both cases?
MR. REID:

Yss.

QUESTION:

There isn't any discrimination against

9

anybody except the opposita sponse, is there?
HR, REID;

Other than the fact that the opposite

spouse could use the money that would ba entitled ~~ that ha
would be entitled to to help raise the family.
QUESTION:

Do you have any difficulty at all with

the clain that this system is unconstitutional because it
discriminates against both men and v.-omen?
MRo Rl.'ID:

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I must say 1 do.

MR* REID:

You mean it would heiva to discriminate --

QUESTION:

I mean how could something discriminate

against both, let us say aliens and non-aliens?
MR0 REID:

If would discriminate against -- in this

case it would discriminate against the man, the male the way
the statutes are written in this particular set of facts.
QUESTION:

You mean in. some eases it might discriminata

against women and in other cases it might —
MR, REID:

I see whet Justice Stevens is saying,

that in this case because the wife is the one that is deceased
she is never going to receive
QUESTION:

The point Is that in some cases

discrimination might be against women and in other cases it
might ba against men.
Is that it?
MRo REID:

It. --

.10

QUESTION:

That ±3 it's against woman if yon think

of them as wag© earners.
MR. REID:

Right.

QUESTION:

And against men if you think of them as

beneficiaries.
MR» REID:

Right.

QUESTION:

Is that it?

MR, REID:

Right.

QUESTION:

So it would depend in each case upon

whether the male or the female were the wage earner and which
spouse was the beneficiary.
MR. REID:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Does the wage earner in this case

contribute to the fund that provides the benefit?
MR. REID:

Your Honor, 'I think indirectly he does,

■ox she does in this particular case.

I realise that Druggist

Mutual's brief correctly states what the law in Missouri is,,
that the employer is the one who pays the benefits on the
workman compensation.

But indirectly all wage earners pay into

that fund.
QUESTION:

But until there is an injury I take it

there is no discriminations as between wage earners of
different saxes.

They both pay the same percentage; neither

of them has any deduction from his salary and there is no
difference.

11

MR0 REID:

Ho, Your Honor, there would be no deduct­

ion from the salary other than the fact I think when you think
about the total amount of labor that the employer would take
this into consideration, how rauch he is paying in for the
workman compensation benefits.
QUESTION:

Well but ho pay© in the same amount for

a female worker as ha does a male worker.
MR, REIDs

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And if the female and male workers are

single and have no dependents at all, so they only would
gat benefits for disability, they are treated alike.
MRo REIDs

That is correct.

QUESTION:

I don't see any discrimination against

anybody except a male in this case.

I don't understand the

theory of discrimination against the female.
ME. REID:

Well, it has been advanced I think in

the American Civil Lbertias brief and pointed out in some other
cases that it does discriminate against against the working
woman for her family.

And that would be the discrimination.

That theory has bean advanced.
QUESTION;

Yon mean because the husband is the wife

of a woman -- is fch® spouse of a tfoman ha is discriminated
against, so that is a discrimination against the woman.
MR, REID;

The woman would be discriminated

because

of her ability to support her family in the event that she

12

had passed away,

That is the theory of the argument that is

used.
QUESTION:

That her employment is worth less than

MR, REID;

That is correct, Your Honor.

the man 5 s.
That is

the theory that I get.
This Court has held that the following classifi­
cations violate the Equal Protection Clausa.

In the Reed

case to eliminate hearings on appointment of administrators
Justice Burger in his opinion indicated that that was not a
legitimate classification, giving preference to a male over
a female.

Also in the Reed case to avoid inner family

controversy, that v?as not a valid classification,
administrative convenience in the decision fay Justice Brennan
in the Frontie.ro decision was not a valid reason for the
classification.

In the Wiesenfeld decision, Justice Brennan's

opinion, the fact that the women were the — the males wore
primary supporters, the. fact that the women were given
benefits in the avent of a husband's death to take care of
the children, which is very close to this case, that benefits
should be paid to the male in the event of the wife's decease.
And. in the Craig ease Justice Brennan points out
that statistical data is not very helpful in deciding Equal
Protection cases.
The accident of birth »- and that is what this is —

13

sexual classification., gender classification, it is an
accident of birth.
And in the Goldfarb case, which is very similar to
this one, a Social Security case.
And I would say that the dissenting opinion in
those cases indicated that this was social legislation.

The

workmen compensation benefit cases are not social-type eases
legislation that Justice Relinquish was writing about in his
dissent.
And finally, in the Wastcotfc case Justice Blackburn
indicated that the one-step test that was advanced in the
dissenting cpinioxi in Goldfarb no longer would be followed by
the Court.
I would also point out to the Court that the strict
scrutiny test is based upon race and that was an amendment to
the Constitution by the Fifteenth Amendment.

And some 50

years after that an amendment was passed, the Nineteenth
Amendment, and that gave women the right to vote.
And in this classification I think that this could
be a suspect classification, strict scrutiny should be applied
to sexes as well as race because sex is an even broader farm
tha-

race, alienage or national origin.

sexes become extinct.

All races have two

This is a law of nature.

Justice

Powell indicated in a concurring opinion in the Craig decision
that due to the fact that the Equal Rights Amendment is

14

pending the Court should not go ahead and apply the strict
scrutiny test at this particular time.
I would point out that the race and the sex are
both amendments to this Constitution and perhaps as the American
Civil Liberties Union has stressed that it is time to apply
the strict scrutiny test in these gender classification cases.
QU3STIGN:

The scrutiny test; so-called, in every

case simply is shorthand for saying you ara going to invalidate
the statute, isn't it?
MR a REID:

think that didn’t happen in the

MR* REID:

Yes.

In the Webstar case that didn't

And also I think Justice Brennan in the Bott

case held that he would not use a strict scrutiny standard
to invalidate that.
not a sex case.

Of course that was a race case, it was

But that is the stricter standard, that is

correct.
QUESTION:

Weil, then isn’t what I asked in my

question basically correct?
MR* REID:

Yes.

QUESTION;

Do you know of a single case in which

any court has ever applied the so-called strict scrutiny test
that it has not ended up by invalidating the statute before
it?

IS

it.
MRo REID;

I would say that the Webster ease would

be a close one, the pro cuream opinion of this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Reid, you rely a good bit on the fact

that the statute is an old one, it dates back to the year -'MRo REID;
QUESTION;

1925, Your Honor.
Suppose there was a distinct legislative

record to the effect that the legislature wanted to compensate
widows for deprivations of the past.

I think I would if the Court would apply

the strict scrutiny standard; yas, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

I repeat Mr. Justice Stewart's question:

Doesn’t the strict scrutiny standard really speak to the
result.

Once you take that standard the result is inevitable.
MR, REID:

We have used that up here many times and every time we use
it it indicates a result.
QUESTION:

Well, we have -- a couple of voting

cases a restriction has been sustained over that kind of a
test and I suppose the origin in race cases was in the
Japanese relocation case which was sustained.
QUESTION:

Of course they did not involve the

16

Equal Protection Clause.
MRo REID:

That involved the Fifth Amendment.

QUESTION:

The Fifth Amendment and involved Federal

action long before it had been perceived that the Dua Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment contained some Equal Protection
ingredient.
QUESTION:

Mr. Reid? can I return for a minute to

this case.
I take it there are alternate remedies that would
be permissible if you prevail? either they could require
proof of dependency from survivors of both sexes or eliminate
proof of dependency.
Is that right?
MR. REIDs

That is correct.

QUESTION:

And if they require proof of dependency

from both sexes that wouldn't cause any harm to male applicants
but it would cause a let of female applicants to lose the
bene fits.
MR a RE ID:

That is corrects Your Honoir.

QUESTION:

And if it took the converse it would give

a lot of money to mala applicants and take nothing away from
female applicants.
MRo REID:

That is correct, four Honor.

QUESTION s

So either way male applicants as a class

will benefit, won't they, if you prevail?

If v?e prevail; yesj that is correct.

for rebuttal.

Mr. Kleinschmtdfe.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH C„ KLEINSCHMIDT» ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MRc KLEINSCHMIDT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I will try not to restate anything that appears in
the briefs but I would like to make some points that 1 don't
think have been emphasised by the briefs.
We are talking in this case about a Workman9s
Compensation law., I think possibly the first time that this
Court has had an industrial accident law in the content with
gander discrimination.
Most of the casos in this area have arisen out of
Social Security laws or Federal welfare laws of one type or
another and they have not arisen out of Workmen's Compensation
laws.

There, are differences between these laws and I think

the difference may well influence the case.

So I would like

to go back and talk about the history and the origin and the
philosophy that underlies a Workmen's Compensation law.
As you recall, these lav/s came into being in the
early part of the century in Missouri in the 1920's and they

IS
camo into being because of a distinct need which had arisen
in an industrialized society.

People were getting hurt in

the factories.
Unfortunately the remedy available to the®, the
common law remedy of master servant was not sufficient at the
time.

Statistically about 30 percent of these people received

any recovery -- recoveries were received.

It was an uneven

handling of it, many received nothing at all because the
commosi law defenses of master servant contributory negligence
fellow servant rule barred claims from being mad© and the
result created not only
a terrible problem for the injured
f
working person but for society itself because these people
had to -- became wards or tended to become wards of society
when people were hurt or killed, in industry.
It was in response to that need that the Workmen’s
Compensation concept was worked out.

The objective of the

compensation concept was to pass on to industry, which is
the area where people get hurt, the cost of these injuries.
The hot ion'was to get certain, benefits and with prompt payment
into the hands of the injured working people.

The method

that was used to achieve this result was a bargain method.
That is important.

All of these rights and duties and

liabilities that appear in Workmen’s Compensation
laws and certainly in the laws of Missouri are bargained
rights and liabilities

That is exactly how the law was put

19

together there.

The trade associations, labor unions

representing the working people on the one hand, various
management organisations representing management through the
public forum of the legislature, and everybody had to give up
komething to get something.

The result in Missouri and else™

where was a law that provided a brand new remedy wholly
substitutional, an exclusive remedy before an administrative
tribunal.
The benefits the law granted were limited to
economic loss.

This was the only thing to bs paid under

Workmen’s Compensation and everything else was given up.

On©

- of the great things the employees had to give up in order to
obtain liability without fault and reparation for economic
loss was the opportunity to obtain the general damages,

damages for anything other than economic loss.

But the whole

Workman's Compensation concept is based upon reparation of
economic loss to the employee or to the employee's dependents.
The workmen's Compensation scheme measures this
economic loss by medical payments on the one hand, weekly
benefits for temporary disabilities, amounts for permanent
disabilities rated by weeks and in cases of death the formula
used is based upon dependency.
The point of all of this is that in this kind of
a law which incidentally the employee contributes nothing to
it, specifically by statute As now allowed to in Missouri.

20

Of course I suppose you would call It. a fringe benefit, it
is a cost but the cost, of this is borne by the employer.
The net effect of all of this is that the purpose
of the Workmen's Compensation law is to pay for economic loss
only, nothing else.

And so if a death occurs, as in this

unfortunate case here where there is no economic loss and it
stipulated there is no economic loss, this law was never
meant to provide Mr. Wenglar -QUESTION:

If a man dies.

MR, KLEIKTSCHMID?:
QUESTION:

presumption that brings us here today.

that there was a stipulation that there was; no economic

was not dependent on the wife.

QUESTION:

This action creates a conclusive

presumption ~*~
HR, KLEINSCUMIDT:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION % — so it precludes any inquiry under the
economic realities.
MR. KLEINSCHMIDT:

Yes, sir? it does indeed. Yet

we feel comfortable with this statute in light of the decisional
law or this Court, most of which has been made within the last
decade.

The cases we rely on primarily are Kahn v. Shevin,

Schlesinger v. Ballard and Ca.lifs.no v. Webster.

In this

series of cases and in others every me'asber of this Court has
upon occasion agreed that there are 3oae gender classifications
which are. constitutionally permissible.

There has been agree-

zaant among all the members of the Court as to what the require­
ments are for that constitutional basis.

It has been agreed

by the members of the Court,as I understand it unanimously,
that where there is a proper governmental purpose and the law
is substantially related to the achievement of that purpose,
it is constitutionally permissible.

And this Court has agreed

23

that a proper governmental purpose is the reduction of past
disparity to woman caused by longstanding discrimination.
All of those things, all of those things fit into
the Missouri scheme of Workmen's Compensation.
QUESTION:

Why does it fit in to treat woman in one

way and men in another?
MRo KLEINSCHMIDT:

Well, by designation if you are

going to justify a gender classification on the basis of a
legitimate governmental purpose in reducing past disparity,
to that extant that you are reducing past disparity, then
you are not treating by definition females equal with the
males.

But there is a permissible reason for -QUESTION:

Why don't you have individual determinations?

If

you had individual determinations every person who was entitled
to it would be recognized, every person who was actually
dep ndent.
MR. XLEINSCHMIDT:

Another recognised governmental

purpose is administrative convenience.

By administrative

convenience, I am not talking about the saving of court
personnel time but I am talking about the certain of determina­
tion of the promptness of payment of benefits.

And if w© had

individual determinations, we would lose that.

an important factor, Your Honor.

the other, if you didn't require proof of dependency for eithe

Well, I was making it in response

Of course 1 think no, of course not?

technically from a constitutionally standpoint, no,.
QUESTION:

Well, then 1 misunderstood you.

X am

sorry.
MR, KLEINSCHMIDT:
that question,

No.

I was simply trying to answer

Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Just as a matter of curiosity Mr.

Klein-

Bohmidt, under the new bill will they require proof of
dependency in all cases or in no cases?
HR. KLEINSCHMIDT:

Under the new bill as I understand

it -- I read it briefly dn the airplane earning up ~~ apparently
there is going to be a conclusive presumption for both genders.
QUESTION:

1 see.

MR» KLEINSCHMIDT:

Yes, a presumption of dependency.
Yes , yes.

thin case that I have heard that the classification used in
thi3 case was not a proper governmental purpose and was not
substantially related to the achievement of the purpose.
is the test.

That

That is the present law that this Court has

announced.
The thing that bothers

that is worrisome is that

it is obvious that to reverse the Missouri decision it seems
to me this Court will have to strictly scrutinize the law,
which is a method of saying:

I certainly agree that .when you

strictly scrutinise you are invalidating the law.

Certainly

that is what amicus the American Civil Liberties Union wants.
They want this Court to issue that clarion call that all
sex discrimination cases shall be inherently suspicious and
in effect, make absolute and inflexible standards out of these
gender classifications.
QUESTION:

What standard do you think Boren

suggests?
MR» KLEIN SCHMIDT:
QUESTION:

I am not prepa red to respond.

Do you think there is some standard

between

in our cases between just rationality and strict

scrutiny?

It is hard to say, I
MR» KLEINSCHMIDT:

It is very difficult to say, four

Honor, it is in the mind of the beholder, really.

The only

The only thing I can be

QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record to show

that there was never a nickel put
HR. KLEINSCHMXDT:

It stipulated that there was just

absolutely no dependency.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MRo KLEXKSCHMIDT:

And that is the economic loss

QUESTION:

And that is the harm.

MR» KLEZNSCHMIDT:
of harm, Your Honor.

I haven9fc been talking in terms

We could talk about that, of coursa v?e

we say otherwise.

loss.

You are talking about what it cost the Government , I

know that; I recognise that.
MR, KLEINSCHMIDTs

Well, in any event it seems to

us chat if this Court were to reverse the Missouri court in
this case it would be sending out a signal itself that It
has been prepared to -move, to sound this clarion call that
ACLU looks for.

And I think it is terribly unwise to do that

at a time when the Equal Rights Amendment is pending in the
legislatures of this land.

This Court is going to ba faced so

soon inextricably with the- questions of draft,registration,
golly knows what else.

It seems to me that the thing to do

l

is to stand on this case and affirm this judgment right now
and take up the cases of true importance as they come.

That

is ay argument. Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Reid?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN W0 REID, II, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRo REIDs
You:

Just a couple of moments for rebuttal,

Honor.
The statute that is pending before the Missouri

legislature is a result of this ease and a result of the
editorial that was written by the two metropolitan papers in
St. Louis and Kansas City.

1 would respond to that.

29

And Mr. Kleinschmidt is correct that under that,
proposal that both spouses would be presumed to be dependent.
And I would state in closing that irrsgardless
of whether the substantial relationship test or the strict
scrutiny test is used that under the decisione in the
5 Seventies of this Court Mr. Wengler should prevail.
I thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
case is submitted.

Thank you, gentlemen.
