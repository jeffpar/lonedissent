MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 73-1821, United States v. Mendenhall.
Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to re­
view a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit-* reversing respondent ■ 3 conviction for
possession of heroin on the ground that the heroin in
question had been discovered as a result of an illegal
search.
The ease began when two trained DEA agents as­
signed to the Detroit Airport observed respondent deplane
from an early morning flight from Los Angeles which they
knew to be a major source city for heroin.

The agents

became suspicious when she exhibited unusual nervousness
and scanned the terminal area as though looking for sur­
veillance,
»

After following her through the airport and
having their suspicions reinforced, they approached her
as she was proceeding down the concourse toward the gate

for an Eastern Airlines flight to Pittsburgh*

They

identified themselves as federal agents and asked 15’ sh®
would show them some identification and her ticket.

Sh®

did so and they* discovered that she was traveling under
an assumed name e

After several more questions * they

asked if she would accompany them, to the nearby DJIA of­
fice for further questioning, which she did.
Once inside the office, the agents asked re­
spondent if she would consent to a search of her pocketbook and of her person, informing hes
right to refuse consent to the search.

that she had a

and the ensuing search disclosed over half a pound ";o.f
heroin.

The entire encounter took about ten minutes.
The District Court found that the agents had a

MR. PREY:

further events in the PEA office took another five .to ten
minutes.

was.

QUESTION:

Including the search?

MR.. PREY:

I believe that is what the evidence

In any event, up to the point where the consent was

g...ven to the search was a relatively brief period of only
a few minutes.

/

The District Court found that the agents had a
reasonable suspicion that respondent was engaged in criminal
activities at the time they first approached her, that
she went to the office with the agents voluntarily :Ln a
spirit of apparent cooperation, and that she thereafter
voluntarily consented to the search,,
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, do you think that when you

say there was a reasonable suspicion from the outset, are
you talking in Terry terms or not?
MR» PREY:

The District Court I think teas talk»

ing in Terry terms.

ir. .

QUESTION:

How about you?

MR. PREY:

Well, I intend to devote- most of my

•

argument to the question of whether this was a Terry stop
ard if so whether the quantum of suspicion was sufficient
to —

1
QUESTION:

For the momentp you are telling us

#hat the District Court held?
MR. PREY:

I am telling you what the District

Court held, that’s correct.

I think ultimately my answer

is probably no, that the standard is net the same aa
Terry but, rather, the lesser standard
QUESTION:

that —

So you don? t think that at the time

they first spoke to her- that they had a right to pat her
down?

6
MR. FREY:

Mo» I don't think they had a right

to pat her down and frisk her but that relates to thereasonable perception that she might be dangerous, which
I don’t think they had.
QUESTI OK':

But it also depends on whether there

was a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity,
MR. FREY:

It does and I do think they had a
.

1

right to detain her at the time they first spoke to; her,
that Is to stop her.

I’m not asserting that they had a

right to frish her and they didn’t frisk her.
QUESTION:

You rely on the Mitem standard, do

MR. FREY:

No, I intend to rely on Martinet-

you?

Fuerte for that proposition, because-in Martlnes-Fuerte,
as I will get to, the Court suggested that the quantum
of suspicion that was needed for a roving patrol stop
In Brignoni-Ponce was not necessary for a referral to
the secondary inspection area for questioning in
Martines-Fuerte, and I think «— while I think they had
enough suspicion to meet the normal Brlgnoni-Ponce
standard in this case. I think the minimal nature of the
intrusion required, even less suspicion than that.
QUESTION:

In other words, there is a standard

below Terry that you rely on for that?
MR. FREY:

Well, It is difficult to say whether

7
Terry — Terry enunciated, a standard on the facts of
Terry and held that what was known to the officer justified
the action that he took in Terry,

I think that tile Court's

ensuing cases have made clear that the Inquiry Is a
measurement of the degree of intrusion involved in the
particular police action weighed against the degree of
suspicion., the basis for the officer's action in the law
enforcement needs.
QUESTION:

You are taking the position — I

don't want to take too much of your time — you are taking
the position that something less than Terry can in home
circumstances justify a detention against the will of the
person detained?
MR. PREY:

fell, I am saying.that the kind of

encounter that incurred in the airport between the agents
and respondent Mendenhall, which we first contend was not
a seizure of her person at all —*
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. PREY:

— if the Court disagrees with that

contention and holds that it is a seizures I am contend­
ing next that some suspicion that might not justify the
stop of an automobile or a frisk would justify going up
to somebody and asking them questions as was done here„
And I am further contending that even if the Court dis­
agrees with that, that what existed here was enough for

8
a Terry stop.
QUESTION:

I understand0

QUESTION:

Mr„ Frey, you9ve been here often

enough so that you will understand this question may be
repetitious»

Is my understanding that your first con­

tention is that a simple approach by a police officer to

l
someone and say I’d like to ask you a question is not a
detention at all -™
MR, FREY:

tfofc a seizure of the person under

the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

'loo a

seizure of the person under

the Fourth Amendment»
MR. FREY:

That is our first contention.

QUESTION:

Are you contending — I will move

now into the drug office — are you depending on her
consent to a search?
MR. FREY:

We are making two alternative <irgu~
■■ f
merits > either of which would Justify a versal of the
Court of Appeals decision, the first that it was supported
by her consent and therefore did not have to meet other
Fourth Amendment requirements, and the second that it did
satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, assuming
that the consent was not sufficient.
QUESTION:

Why do you need the second one if

you have the first one?

9
MR. PREY:

Well,, I*m not sups that you will

agree with the first one and therefore —QUESTION:

What you really want to do Is extend

it a little, donTt you?
MR. FREY:

I*m not sure I understand.

QUESTION:

You want to extend it beyond consent.

MR. PREY:

Ho, our -—

consent will he forcedly held»
MS. FREY;

QUESTION:

Isn't that what you want us to do?

MR. FREY:

I believe that what you would 00

logically would be to first —
QUESTION:

Well, why would we nave to do the

second one?
MR. PREY:

You don’t have to reach the second

issue if you agree with us on the first with regard to
the move to the office»

The District Court sustained the

move to the office on the ground of respondent * s consent
to go to the office.

If that finding is not clearly er-

r-oneous and «—
QUESTION:

You were telling us what the District

Court did -MR. FREY:

That is our argument.

QUESTION:

— and you were half-way through

10
that and you haven’t even got to the Court of Appeals yet.
MR. PREY:

That's correct.

I'm not sure 1 have

answered Justice Marshall's question, but —
QUESTION:

It doesn’t matter to me.

MR. PREY:

We are not Insisting that you reach

the second issue about whether this would be permissible
in the absence of her consent., but if you find that there
was not & valid consent than we do present that second
issue for your decision„
Mow, the Court of Appeals reversed and in es­
sence the court held that the factors relied upon to
Justify the initial encounter with respondent did not
give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity
because respondent’s actions as observed by the agents
were- consistent with innocent behavior.
It further held that asking respondent to ac­
company the agents to the DEA office constituted an arrest
requiring probable cause on the ground that respondent was
net

free to leave at the time this occurred.

Finally,

the court held that- the consent to the search was not
valid.
Present for decision by this Court are three
questions, each of which has two sub-issues.

The first

question concerns the initial encounter between the agents
and the respondent- and whether that violated her Fourth

11
Amendment rights.

And as I have mentioned, we contend

that it did not, for two reasons:
It was not a seizure

First, we contend that

of her person within the meaning of

the Fourth Amendments and, secondly, we contend that if
it was, it was supported by the necessary degree of
suspicion to justify the particular minimal intrusive
encountermenfc.
QUESTION:

And the facts were she was the last

off the airplane and then she went to the American Air­
lines counter —
MR. FREY:

Well, I would also —

QUESTION:

— and it was there that she was ~

MR. FREY:

Well, I can get into that in some

detail, if you would like.

The facts on which the

agents relied were first that she casae from Los Angeles
which — they were watching the flight from Los Angeles
because it was known by them to be a source city of
Mexican heroin.

When she got off the plane, she got off

last, but 3! think that is a sub-category of the fact
that she looked around as though looking for surveillance
and. seemed unusually nervous, and that I think is quite
clear is what triggered the agents’ suspicion of her,
and indeed I will argue that that in itself, because of
t e nature of the agents’ experience would b® sufficient
to justify what the agents thereafter did.

12
They in, fact followed her as she went down, to
the baggage area, didn’t pick up any baggage —
QUESTION:

Well, her baggage was checked through

to Pittsburgh, wasn't It?
MR. FREY:
baggage or not.

We don't know whether she had any

There is no —

QUESTION:

If any, I mean she was enroute to

Pittsburgh.
MR. PREY:

I am telling you what occurred.

The

agent had no idea at that point whether she was getting
off at Detroit or making a connection sold© place else.
So as he described it in his testimony initially, he;
followed her down to the baggage area, she didn’t pick
up any baggage.

It would have been suspicious if she

hid been getting off at Detroit.

She then went back up­

stairs to the Eastern Airlines counter and appeared to
the agent, asked the ticket agent at the Eastern counter
for a ticket on an Eastern flight to Pittsburgh.

It ap­

peared to the agent that she was changing her flight
from some other carrier to Eastern.
QUESTION:

Well, American doesn't fly between —

QUESTION:

Doss it show as to what carrier she

was booked on as far as the rest of her tickets were
concerned —
MR. FREY:

It was an American Airlines ticket which —
QUESTION:

That ie the issuing carrier, but

American Airlines doesn't fly from Detroit to Pittsburgh.
MR. FREY:

Well, you say that and I accept that

ae true, but I'm not sure what the significance of that
is in terms of — the question is not whether the agent
was right that she had originally been booked on American
Airlines to Pittsburgh.
QUESTION':

We simply don't know —

Well, there was an agent at that

airport, wasn't he?
MR. PREY:

That’s true, but one would presume

QUESTION:

One would presume that they would

that

know where the various airlines went to.
MR, FREY:
question to presume.

I'm not sure that that is a fairI think that is a subject which

should have been explored on cross-examination6

In any

event, there is nothing in the record to suggest whether
or1 not she was changing from some other carrier to
Eastern.

The testimony is t!I stood in line directly

behind her, she retrieved an airline ticket from her
purse, presented that to the Eastern ticket agent and
asked for a ticket, aa Eastern ticket ft be used on her
flight from Detroit to Pittsburgh.”

14
Now, I don't think our* case is dependent on the
ultimate accuracy of this observation.
QUESTION:

Then what happened?

She still hadn't

been directly approached by the —
MR. PREY:

And then the ticket agent gave her a

boarding pass for the Eastern flight, she started down the
concourse and at that point the agents came up to her and
said we're federal agents. would you please show us your—
QUESTION:

MR. PREY:

That was the first contact —

MR. FREY:

That!a correct.

QUESTION:

As she was going down toward the

MR, PREY:

Down the concourse.

QUESTION:

— toward the Eastern gate to

gate- —

Pittsburgh?
MR. PREY:

That's correct.

That is correct.

In any event, in terms of ray statement of the
issues that are presented before I get Into the discus­
sion of the issues, the second issue is the validity of
the transfer of the situs of the interviewer encounter
from the airport concourse to the DEA terminal office.
And as I suggested, we have two arguments there:

One,

15
that it was supported by her voluntary consent and the
secomis that it was in any event a reasonable limited ex­
tension of a Terry stop.
By the way, at the point they went to the airport
office* there is no questions I don’t think it is disputed,
t\iat they had at least Terry-type reasonable suspicion
because they then —QUESTION:

They had reasonable suspicion that

she was armed?
MR. FREY:

Mo.

QUESTION:

That is what Terry has to do with.

MR. FREY:

Well* let us say Brignoni-Ponce

reasonable suspicion.

Whatever the constitutional —

however high the Court chooses to set the constitutional
floor for a stop based on reasonable suspicion, less
than probable cause, a seizure of the person, not a frisk
but a seizure of the person, a. detention, this case
satisfied It once the agents talked to her and found out
she was traveling under an alias, because we are now
close to if not over the line of probable cause, and I’m
sure that constitutes suspicion or reasonable suspicion
in anybody’s book to justify the stop.

And I don’t

understand the Court of Appeals to have said that there
was not reasonable suspicion at that point, and I just
want to make it clear that when they moved to the office,

16
we have now shifted our debate to whether they needed
probable cause to justify that movement* and that is what
the Court of Appeals held* that probable cause was neces­
sary to support that.
QUESTION:

Well* what did the Court of Appeals

do with Judge DeMascio's finding that before the actual
search was made there was probable cause?

As I read the

Court of Appeals opinion, it did nothing with it.
MR. PREY:
disagreed with it.

Well, I think it is plain that they
The opinion is tat her succinct and.

X 0 — **■*

QUESTION:

Well* cryptic is the word I would

MR. PREY:

Well* perhaps — and it is difficult

use.

to tell* but I think one can only conclude that they did
not agree with his finding that there was probable cause
and that I think essentially is — it is not something
we have contended here because in our view it is not —
probable cause is not necessary for what occurred,
QUESTION:

Do you have a view on whether there

was probable cause?
MR. FREY:

At the time of the search, I think

it is quite arguable* because at the time of the search
of her person which disclosed, the heroin, they not only
knew that she had been traveling under one alias coming

17
back from Lob Angeles but that she had traveled on yet a
different alias and going on yet a different carrier go­
ing out from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles which I would sup­
pose is consistent with an evasive pattern that drug
couriers —
QUESTION:

Prom your answer, I don't know what

your view is , whether there was probable cause or not,
MR. PREY:

Well, I haven’t really thought about

it in the course of preparing the argument.
QUESTION:

Well, have you thought whether, even

if there was, whether the search was Justified without
consent?
MR. PREY:

If there was probable cause?

QUESTION:

No, no —

PREY:

That is the same question, isn't it?

If there was probable cause —
QUESTION:

No, no.

Mo, it isn’t.

consent, probable cause to search.
MR. PREY:

If no

Is the search okay?

The search would be okay if the de­

tent ion at that point was not a fruit of a prior Fourth
Amendment violation, in which case there would be a
separate issue.
QUESTION:

What was the emergency?

MR. PREY:

What was the emergency in terns of

searching her person?

18
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FREY:

Well, they- would have probable cause

to arrest her if they had. probable cause to search her,
and the search could be made incident to an arrest.
QUESTION:

Well, they never arrested her, did

MR. PREY:

Well, I’m not sure that that would,

they?

be necessary to sustain the search.
QUESTION:

So you say that you just don't ever

reach any of those questions because you don't care to
have to decide the —
MR. PREY:

We rely ~~ we don't ask you to

decide whether this was supportable as a probable cause
search.

We rely on her consent, which the District Court

found to be voluntary and which I don't believe the Court
of Appeals questioned the voluntariness of.

And if she

was legally detained at the time she consented, then I
think there :1s no basis for striking down the search.

If

she was illegally detained, then that raises the issue of
whether the taint of the illegal detention was attenuated
by —
QUESTION:

Even if consent was voluntary, it

m ght be the product of an illegal detention?
'MR. PREY:

It might be.

Indeed, under the

Court of Appeals view, it is fair to say that you could

19
not give a voluntary valid consent when you are in an il­
legal detention.

Our view, of course, is that you can in

the particularly way of advice of your right to refuse
to consent, that attenuates the taint.
QUESTION:

Of course, your view really is that

there was no detention at all, isn’t it?
MR. PREY:

Our view is that there was no deten­

tion at- the initial encounter.
QUESTION:

Even in the office there was a de­

I am not sure what the answer is„

QUESTION:

The very word "detention" implies

being held against somebody’s will, and. if she went
voluntarily along with them to the office and voluntarily
consented to the search and so on, there was no detention

question which I had not planned to get into of their sub­

MR. FREY:

is quite ambiguous as to the point at which he would have

But did he say that?

MR. FREY:

mony that once he found out she was traveling under an
alias he would have stopped her had she attempted to

I take it as a fact that he would

have stopped her once he found out she was traveling

under an alias had she tried to leave»
QUESTION:

Well* what exactly did he testify to?

HR. FREY:

Well* the testimony — the particular

testimony that we are adverting to now was given on crossexamination in response to what seems to me a somewhat
ambiguous question.

He is describing the — this is at

page 18 and IS of the appendix — and he says they looked
at her license and they had reason to believe that she
was Sylvia Mendenhall.

And then the question, had she

put that identification in her purse arid, walked away
from you, you would have stopped her, wouldn’t you, be­
cause you wanted to ask her some more questions, and he
says yes.
Now, I'm not quite clear because it is never
clarified -—
QUESTION:

Well, couldn’t the U.S. Attorney

on redirect straighten that out?
MR. FREY:

Yea, of course.

I don’t argue —

our position is that what he would have done is not
material, it is only what he did do that counts»

But

you are right that the uncertainty as to whether --- I do
not think that it is clear from this record, that he in­
tended to forcibly detain her from the very first moment
he approached her»

I don’t think that that is at all

clear from the record.

QUESTION:

Well,

Mr.

Prey, In the office when

the officer advised her that she need not consent to the
search, he
MR. FREY:

He did advise her that, yes.

QUESTION:

I suppose that is either directly

or indirectly an assertion or an opinion that he didn’t
have probable cause to arrest.
MR. FREY:

No, not at all, not at all, since

I think the normal practice and the proper practice is to
seek consent even If you do believe you have probable
cause»
QUESTION:

I know, but if you arrest you don’t

have any right to refuse to search.
MR. FREY:

But you could tell somebody that

they have a right to refuse a search in an effort to in­
sure that you have secured the voluntary consent even
though if they say I refuse you could then say well , I
have decided that I am going to arrest you and search
you,
QUESTION:

all his advice was that if you

don’t want to be searched, I won’t search you?

Is that

MR. FREY:

If the officer thought he had prob­

able cause to search he. he might very well then have
sought a warrant in order to do it»

But since he obtained

her consent, the question never arose as to what he should
do if she didn't consent.
QUESTION:
record?

Mr. Frey, do I misunderstand the

X was under the impression he obtained her con­

sent before they went to the office.
MR. FREY:

There are two different findings of

consent by the District Court.

The first Is that she

consented in a spirit of apparent cooperation voluntarily
to go from the terminal to the nearby office, and the
second is a finding that once in the office and asked for
a consent to search, she voluntarily consented to be

searched.
QUESTION:

Is there evidence in the record that

she was asked for an additional consent in the office?
MR. FREY:

Yes, absolutely.

QUESTION:

I missed, it.

MR. FREY:

If is quite clear0

In fact, he is

asked to recite in specific words the words that he used.
Now, let me turn briefly to the question of
whether what happened here was a seizure.

The position

of respondent and of the ACLU essentially is that when a
police officer approaches someone whom he finds suspicious
and asks that person questions, that ought to be presump­
tively a seizure in the absence of a statement to the
individual that they have a right to leave.
Now, as Terry makes clear, seizure is an actual
restraint upon the individual’s freedom to walk away„
Accordingly, we agree with Professor LaFave’s analysis of
the problem and we quote from him in our brief, that this
kind of encounter is only properly deemed a seizure if
the officer is engaged in some additional conduct beyond
the approach and the inquiry, whether by action or by
statement that would indicate to the individual that his
freedom of movement has been curtailed.
Now, the Court has not squarely decided this
issue, but we do think chat Terry indicates the Court's

25
view on it, and I refer to Footnote 16 in Terry, where the
Court, in talking about whether the initial contact between
the officer and Terry at which he walked up to him and
asked him for identification was a seizure, saying that
it didn't have to, wasn't going to decide that, the Court
said obviously not all personal intercourse between police­
men and citizens involve seizures of persons, only when
the officer by means of physical force or show of authority
*\

has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we
conclude that a seizure has occurred.
We cannot tell with any certainty upon this
record whether any such seizure took pla.ee here prior to
Officer McFadden's initiation of physical contact for
the purpose of searching Terry for weapons»

Now, of

course, if the view of respondent were correct, they
could have told perfectly

well that there had been a

seizure because ~QUESTIOM:

Mr. Frey, I take it your basic po­

sition Is that an officer could Just at random pick out
somebody in an airport and do exactly — and the sane
events that happened here transpired and you would say
there was no violation of law.
MR. FREY;

Well, I think that is our position,

that there would not be a seizure but I do think —
QUESTION:

And no violation of the Fourth

Amendment in any of these

as a result of any of these

events ~~
MR. PREY:

We are talking only about walking

up to somebody and. asking them a couple of questions and
for* identification.
QUESTION

And then asking them into the office

MR. PREY

If they consent.

QUESTION

Which you say they did

MR. PREY

We are -—

QUESTION

Then the search, which you say there

was consent to.
MR. FREY:

Well, that would clearly be a search

QUESTION:

Yes, but it was consent to.

MR. PREY:

I understand, that would be —

QUESTION:

Any citizen would have no —

MR. PREY:

Well --

QUESTION:

If these same things happened to

any citizen., there would be no violation of the Fourth
Amendment»
MR. FREY:

Well, I think there is a difference

because — the difference is that when you come to u
search, you are talking about an action which is in fact
governed by the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Yes, but you say there was consent.

MR. PREY:

That!s right.

I say it is lawful.

2?
yes, it is consistent with —•
QUESTION:

Well* .your position is that it does

not violate the Fourth Amendment»
MR. FREY:

Well9 I think there is a difference

between saying that a particular incident does not impli­
cate the Fourth Amendment and saying that an incident
does not violate the Fourth Amendments and in the one case
I would say it is not implicated and the other not violated.
QUESTION:

Then in any event, the answer no my

question is any citizen picked out at random would not
have had his Fourth Amendment rights violated by those
events?
MR. PREY:

Had he agreed to cooperate right

down the road —
QUESTION:

As happened here.

MR. FREY:

—- as happened here.

QUESTION:

As you say happened here.

MR. FREY:

Now, let me Just — I Just want to

emphasise again Martinez-Fuerte because I don't think
we made this point quite clear in our brief.

But in

Martinez-Fuerte what was involved was an initial stop
at a check-point followed by a referral to a secondary
inspection area based essentially on the officer's
suspicion and nothing more than an indication of Mexican
ancestry on the part of the passengers of the car.

That

28
unquestionably is a. seizure of the occupants of the car
within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and yet the
Supreme Court upheld that on the basis cf suspicion that
they said was not to satisfy the requirements for stop-»
ping an automobile in Brignoni-Ponce*
Now., in this case what everyone may conclude
about the suspicion that existed on the part of the of­
ficers;, I think there was a, great deal more than the
suspicion that was considered satisfactory in M&rtinezFuerte.
I would like to reserve the balance of my time.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr, Karfonta.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF P. RANDALL KARFONTA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
i.

MR. KARFONTA;
please the Court;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

I am Randall Karfonta, representing

Sylvia Mendenhall in this case.
Initially, I would briefly like to clarify
some of the facts on this record.

First of all, the

agents were looking for basically any citizen to stop.
There) was no information that any specific heroin was
coming to Detroit, nor- were they looking for any specific
individual.

23
As far1 as the lack of baggage factor goes, a
close reading of the record will show that at the hearing
the agent didn’t contend that this i?as of continuing
significance; rather, the government has continued to
argue it in their briefs.
As far as the detention in the office, the
record contains no written or oral consent.

It is abso­

lutely barren of any consent to going to that office.
Once Sylvia Mendenhall was in. that office, she was asked
to take a. seat and then for the first time the matter of
a search was raised»

The matter of a strip search was

first raised after the consent was allegedly given, and
at that point Sylvia Mendenhall said I have to catch my
plane, I’ve got to leave, and she was told that she
would be free to leave if she had nothing on her.

She

kept repeating that and, as the testimony states, then
began taking her clothes off, taking her time.
As to the matter of time that was raised dur­
ing the prosecutor’s argument, the time as is reflected
on the record was five to six minutes until the consent
to search was given, but the record does not reflect how
long it took to call the female officer for the female
officer to come to the office and for the actual search
itself to begin.
Our first contention is that the defendant was

30
arrested within th® meaning of the Fourth Amendment when
she was in that private locked DEA office for the purpose
of a search of her body.

The entire transactions the

design and execution was for an investigatory seizure to
search Sylvia Mendenhall.

A reasonable person in those

circumstances could only believe that they were under
arrest.

She was not told she was free to leave.

She was

not asked when her plane was leaving, and the setting of
the office Itself makes that clear.
The facts in this case are nothing like any of
the stop facts this Court has discussed.

I believe as

far as this Court has gone was in United States v.
Brignoni-Ponce, and in that case we are talking about
searches that were usually --■ or stops, rather, that
were usually a minute in duration and Involved a visual
inspection.

There were no exigences present in this

ease.
Rather, the detention in this case is much
more and is merely exactly like the detention in Dunaway
v. Hew York, where Dunaway was transported to a police
station, placed in an interrogation room and was not,
informed that he was free to leave.

The only difference

here was that Sylvia Mendenhall was also being held in
communicadOo
We have examined the case law of this Court

31
and we have found three criteria for determining the
point of arrest — freedom of movementf the purpose of
the detentionj and the duration of the detention.
QUESTION:

You say there was no right or power

on the part of the officers to ask her questions and ask
to see her ticket in the circumstances that existed here?
MR. KARFONTA:

Your Honors I believe that under

Brown v. Texas it is clear that when they asked to see
her driver’s license. required her- to answer questions
and then required her to give them her airline ticket9
that she had been seized within the Fourth Amendment,
QUESTION:

You say required her.

MR.. KARFONTA:
QUESTION:

Yes.

The Court has said on a number of

occasions that officers may ask you questions quite
freely of citizens and citizens have a right to refuse
to answer if they want to.
MR. KARFONTA:

That’s correct, but I believe

that this Court unanimously he3.d just last term in Brown
v. Texas that when the officers detained, the appellant
for the purpose of requiring him to identify himself,
they performed a seizure of his person subject to the
requirements of the Fourth Amendment.

It seems to me

that —
QUESTION:

Well, is there a difference between

32
saying eo®e over here* I want to ask you a, few questions,
and simply coming up to a person and saying
name?

what’s

your

I mean is there a separate concept of detention

as opposed to simply posing a question to & person?
MR. KARFQNTA:

I think there is, Your Honor.

The government has referred to Mr. LaF&vev s treatise and
I know that in his treatise he makes the differentiation
between an adversarial contact, which is how I would
characterise this ease, and seeking information from
citizens in general regarding community matters.
QUESTION:

«sell, when do you become adversary?

MRo KARFOHTA:

I believe in this case it was

adversary from the beginning because *—
QUESTION:

Is that because of something that

was in the officer’s mind or is it something that was
in her mind?
MR. KARFONTA:

I believe that it would be in

the officer's mind, in her mind and also the objective
circumstances.
QUESTION:

Of course, there was certainly some

tension in her mind because she knew she had heroin, but
the officer didn't know that she had heroin.
MR. KARFONTA:

Well, I think that in terms of

looking at the consent issue, that Schneckloth indicates
that in determining consent you have to consider the

33
vulnerable subjective state of mind of the person from
whom consent is being sought.
QUESTION:

You mean if the person in fact has a

packet of heroin on their person or in a package in their
possession, then that gives them some special category?
MR. KARFONTA:

I don't believe so.

I gueus

what X*m saying is I think on this record —*
QUESTION:

When you suggested vulnerability —

MR. KARFONTA:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, I —

— I suppose a person who has got a

packet of herein does indeed feel somewhat vulnerable.
MR. KARFONTA:

That’s true. Judge.

I think the

argument I am trying to make is that here the testimony
was that the point this consent, this alleged consent
to the detention was given, Sylvia Mendenhall was so
nervous she was unable to speak, barely able to put her
license in her purse, back in her purse, and I think
that Schneeklofch says that the subjective state of mind
of an individual is vary important in determining the
consent.
QUESTION:

Mr. Karfonta, supposing the police

are investigating a dead body they found on a lawn in
front of somebody’s house and they see a neighbor looking
over and the policeman simply calls over and

he says

do you know anything about this, is that a detention or

3**

arrest or Terry stop?
MR. KARFONTA:
QUESTION:

Ha, I cion31 believe It is.

-Suppose the neighbor comes over to

the scene that Mr. Justice Relinquish has aescrS.hed, and
then the police officer says will you please just wait
here for a few minutes, I want to ask you some questions
-- arrests detention?
MR. KARPONTA:

Probably not arrest or detention,

but —
QUESTION:

Suppose then the person began to go

away and the officer said I want you to stay here, there
has been a homicide, an3 I want you to stay here as a
material witness — arrest?
MR. KARPONTA:
QUESTION:

Probably.

Probably arrested then.

MR. KARPONTA:

As I was first discussing, in

Dunaway v. New York the Court held that freedom of move­
ment is a controlling factor in determining the point of
arrest.

Here I believe the objective circumstances, the

fact that Sylvia Mendenhall was not tolc. she was free to
go, and the fact that in fact she was net free to go in­
dicate satisfaction of that factor.
Secondly, we look to the purpose of the deten­
tion.

Here the purpose of the detention was not to main­

tain the status quo. it was not for identification

35
purposes.

The officer testified that on the concourse he

was satisfied that this person was Sylvia Mendenhall.
Rather,, the only purpose in going to that office was to
search for narcotics, and Sbron. v. Mew York and Ybarra v.
Illinois indicate that when the purpose is to search for
narcotics that probable cause 13 required because that
situation is an arrest.
Finallys the length of the detentions United
States v. Brlgiioni-Ponce says detention must be brief.
In that case, the detentions were ordinarily about a
minute.

Her®., Sylvia Mendenhall was not told she was

free to leave.

In their Court of Appeals pleadings5 the

government has indicated that if a person refuses consent
in the DBA office, DEA then seeks a search warrant.

In

the companion case;, in an en bane hearing in. this case,
the officer testified ’’well, then we? told Mr. Camacho
that it would take us an hour or three or four hours to
obtain this search warrant.”
in this case.

No tine was ever specified

It was a potentially indefinite detention.

I think the law of this Court is clear,, that
once Sylvia Mendenhall was in that interrogation -.of Tice,
the situation was an arrest; arid, further, I think
common sensa indicates that this Is an arrest situation.
There was no consent to that detention.have Indicated, the record

4s I

is barren of any verbal or

36
written consent to that detention.

Sylvia Mendenhall was

not told she had any choice about going to that office.
QUESTION:

The District Court found that there

was consent, that she voluntarily went to the office and
that finding was in no way disturbed by the Court of
Appeals, as I read the record.
ME. KARFOHTA:
QUESTION:

Well» I would answer that —

Am I mistaken about that?

MR. KARFONTA:

I would say on the second point

you are mistaken in the sense that they said there was
no consent to the
QUESTION:

To the search.

MR. KARFONTA:

You’re right, Judge, Your Honor,

tout —
QUESTION:

Am I mistaken or net?

MR. KARFONTA:

No, you*re not.

w'hat I would

indicate though is that this record is totally barren of
anything indicating consent to the detention, therefore
the finding of the District Court is easily clearly
erroneous, there is nothing on this record indicating
that.
Further* the burden is on the prosecution,
there is no reason to think that she would have chosen
this in eomamnieado detention, she was extremely nervous,
all these facts militata against a free and voluntary

37
consent-

But most importantly» there is nothing on this

record stating any consent to a detention.
QUESTION:

Suppose as you are leaving the court

room today on® of the officers approaches you and says»
"Mr. Kodak9 the clerk of the court would like to see you
for a few minutes9” what do you think your situation is?
Are you detained» are you arrested, or what?
MR. KARFOWTA:
QUESTION:

No, I don't think so.

If you go there, to his office and

the secretary says, "Well, Mr. Kodak is on the telephone,
will you sit down and wait for five minutes," are you de­
tained?
MIL KARFONTA:

I don't think tills is the kind

of adversarial confrontation between a police officer
and

b.

citizen —
QUESTION:

Is that perhaps partly because you

know that you have no heroin on you or no contraband of
any kind?
MR. KARFONTA:

Mo, that question is like when

did you stop beating your wife.
QUESTION:

Mot at all.

Not at all.

emphasised the vulnerability of a witness.

You have

You would

go very freely because you don’t feel very vulnerable
about anything, do you, in this setting?
MR. KARFONTA:

On the other hand, if one of

38
the DSA agents, some of whom I knows csm.e up to ice and
said we want you to go into this little room off the
corridor here * away from the court room and we’re going
to have a little talk with you about some of the things
you said, I would be a little apprehensive,,

But if it

was going to Mr. Kodak’3 office., I don't think this is
the kind of adversarial confrontation between a police
officer and a citizen that the commentators in the cases
envisioned.
QUESTION:

Would you consider it adversarial

if the particular citizen has no contraband, no drugs,
no firearms or ~~
MR. KARFONTA:

I think that is the entire part

of the defense5s contention in this case, is on the
k nds of factors, this person was stopped and then ar­
rested, it could apply to the search of anyone anywhere
on just basically nothing.

I think that is the point,

that the Fourth Amendment doesn't allow these kinds of
wholesale intrusions„
QUESTION:

Dc you think cha Court of Appeals

set aside or disturbed the finding of consent to the
search in the drug office?
MR. KARFONTA:
QUESTION:

I definitely do.

By direct statement or by inference?

MR. KARFONTA:

I believe xfhat the Court of

39
Appeals said was that there if as no consent to the search
In this case within the meaning of United States v,
Me Caleb .,
Just one more point on the consent to the de«tention, and that is that Bumper v. North Carolina also
makes it very clear that mere aequiesen.ce in the .face of
authority is not the kind of free and voluntary consent
that is required.
Secondly, we contend that there was no reason­
able suspicion for the stop when all the agents -knew that
the point of the stop was that Sylvia Mendenhall had
flown from Los Angeles to Detroit, was the last person
off the airplane and noticed the agents.
Now, the government has argued —
QUESTION:

And was traveling under an assumed

name,
MR. KARFONTA:

I was speaking of the point of

the initial search. Your Honor.

The government has a&~>

ditiori ally argued two factors, transfer of airline plans
and lack of baggage.

Those both are facts that evaporated

prior to the stop in this case.

Great emphasis has been

placed in these cases, these airport profile cases on the
experience of the agents, but 1 think that in order to.
— that experience is a two-way street, that when the
agents see something that negates suspicion, that should

stop them from detaining a citizen.
Here the agente proceeded to detain, the citizen
even though there was no transfer of airlines factor in
this case.

The government has argued that these experi­

enced agents are familial" with ail the airline schedules.
Well,, in this case the agent testified on the record that
he was not familiar with the relevant airline schedules.
Furthers there is no showing on this record that would
support his conclusion that she was changing airlines.
This experienced agent should have Ioiovn that when she
went to that Eastern counter and they said all you need
to get on that plane is a boarding pass. that she was
already scheduled on that flight.

Further, had he known

the airline’s schedule or taken a moment to check it, he
would have found that there was no American flight from
Detroit to Pittsburgh.
This transferred airlines factor has appeared,
in no other case.

In fact, in other arrests in reported

opinions that occurred at Detroit Metropolitan Airport,
i

'using direct flights was the factor in those eases.
Second —
QUESTION;

What if in this case she had been

booked from Los Angeles to Minneapolis, she immediately
arrives in Minneapolis, goes to the counter of ah airline
that has a flight from Minneapolis to Mew York and

41
switches her ticket or perhaps buys a ticket from
Minneapolis to New York, and the agent says thatf s unusual
because you could have easily booked directly out of Los
Angeles to Mew York without going to Minneapolis.

la that

a permissible profile factor to consider?
MR. KARFONTA:

Well, Judge, Your Honor, I be­

lieve that you have to consider everything that the agent
actually knew and in our brief we contend that the profile
itself does not arise reasonable suspicion and none of the
Courts of Appeals have held .it has.
QUESTION:

You think nothing short of probable

cause then is sufficient to even warrant further interro­
gation?
MR. KARFONTA:

Mo, I believe that when there i3

reasonable suspicion and there are Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals and Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals cases that
have found reasonable suspicion, but then a proper stop,
an investigatorial stop and reasonable suspicion is proper.
QUESTION:

But you don't think that any rather

strange conduct in airline routing and sudden changes of
destinations are permissible factors in a profile?
MR. KARFONTA:

Oh, yes, 1 do because I think

that it is common law that such things as flight can be
considered in arrest situations, and so I think all factors
can be considered.

I think that is a very elusive factor,

>i 2
but certainly all factors ought to be considered.
As I Indicated, the lack of baggage factor also
evaporated prior to the stop in this case.

The agent

didn’t even contend that it was of continuing significance
to him; rather, the government has continued to argue it,.
At any rate* once he knew she was going on to Pittsburgh,
through common sens© or through the airline regulations
he should have realized that she would have no baggage
with her.
Proper police practice In this case I believe
would have been

to continue the surveillance, as has

been done in a number of Second Circuit cases, such as
United States v. Oates.

They knew she wasn’t leaving

the airport, they could have called ahead to Pittsburgh
if they wanted to watch her and set up a proceeding to
$

detain a citizen.
Looking quickly at the factors they did know,
the flight from Los Angeles to Detroit, it seems that in
these profile cases the government has virtually
characterized almost every city as being a source or a
place

you go through or destination —
QUESTION:

.

If you .are right, what could have

been done In Pittsburgh?

There is no probable cause,

there is no probable cause, either in Detroit or
Pittsburgh.

r.

il3
MRo KABFONTA:

That’s correct , Your Honor, but

I used the example of the United States v. Oates, when
they got to Pittsburgh, a bulge mysteriously appeared,
that he had talked with a known narcotics dealer, the
traveling companion was a known narcotics addict -—
QUESTION:

But in this case you are suggesting,

well,, it is very easy, the government .just could have
wired ahead or telephoned ahead to Pittsburgh.

But if

you are correct, that there is no probable causes there
is no probable cause.

If this seizure end search

violated the constitutional rights of your client in
Detroit, a seizure and search would equally have violated
those rights in Pittsburgh, would it not?
MR. KARFONTA:

That’s correct, Your Honor,

What I am indicating is that if they had continued their
investigation perhaps something else would have turned up.
QUESTION:

You mean, for example, if they got

to Pittsburgh they might have telephoned Pittsburgh and
said watch this woman when she gets off; if, one, she is
last to leave the plane, and, two, she looks nervous, and,
three, she doesn’t in fact have any luggage to pick up,
then stop her and arrest her, something like that?
MR. KARFONTA:
QUESTION:

Mo, no.

Well, what are the additional factors

that you suggest might supplement what Mr. Justice Stewart

44
Just put to you?
MR- KARFONTA:
QUESTION':

I am Indicating ~

You said some other factors might

show up.
MR. KAHFONTA:

I guess I am indicating that

since those are the same factore we have In Detroit,,
and since I don’t feel that those factors have very much
value, that those factors occurring twice would not have
been —
QUESTION:

Well, why don't you take the three

that I have just mentioned, suppose they did occur, the
agent found in Pittsburgh she was the last to leave the
plane, as she had been before —~
MR. KARFOHTA:
QUESTION:

Right.
and that she did not have any

luggage, in fact even though that is quite a long trip

to be without luggage, and third, she acted in a very
nervous manner in the same way the telephone call, had
described her conduct previously, do you think those
might finally reach a point where it would cross over the
\

line?
MR. KAHFONTA:

Not to raise reasonable suspicion,

no, X don *t.
QUESTION:

And what was the point of your sug­

gestion. that they wait until they get tc Pittsburgh?

MR. KARFONTA:

The point of my suggestion was

that very often in continuing an investigation additional
factors do turn up and sometimes they don't., and then you
cannot proceed to detain a citizen.
QUESTION:

Well, you said one of them would be

that if on arrival In Pittsburgh she was met by a person
known to the- Pittsburgh agent as a drug dealer, of course,
there you are so far over the line that you are leaving
no room for any analysis at all- are you?
MR. KARFONTA:

I don’t believe that Is true.

I think that in looking at the case law, the Sixth Circuit
and the Second Circuit have both held that mysterious
bulges such as in one case, a person was seen walking
with an odd gait, with an odd bulge in the crotch area
indicating that there was something concealed there, I
think those kinds of factors can begin to create reason­
able suspicion.

I don’t think these totally innocuous

things, where there is no tie-in with criminal activity,
can present justification for stepping s citizen.
As to the nervousness factor, it is difficult
to hypothesise on & more common characteristic to airline
passengers than nervousness,
QUESTION;

When they are getting on or when

they are getting off?
MR. KARFONTA:

As far as X personally, I would

say that would be from the time I leave home until the time
I arrive at my destination away from the airport.
Following the government *s case here» I believe
ifc is similar to Brown vc Texas as there is no tie-in with
criminal activity.

In Spenell v. United States, Mr.

Justice White worte in concurrence, no one would suggest
that Just anyone getting off the 10:30 train dressed as
Draper was, with a brisk walk and carrying a sipper bag,
should be arrested for carrying narcotics.

I query

whether Mr» Justice White would have felt differently
had Draper been last off the train.
Other circuits have reviewed circumstances very
similar to this case.

We cited United States v. Ballard,

a Fifth Circuit ease, in our brief, at pages 37 and 38.
And I recently last week sent a recent Second Circuit
opinion, United States v. Buena Venture, and they
reach the same obvious result, that this ia not a suf­
ficient cause for stopping a citizen.
The drug courier profile itself is an amorphous
unwritten conglomeration of characteristics which the
government characterises as constantly changing.

Some

courts have commented that the profile seems to change
itself with the facts c-f each case»

In fact, if you look

at the characteristics we have listed in

our footnotes -

you would see there would be a rare airline passenger

4?
that would not fit general of these characteristics* and
this is particularly true given the agent5s ability to
find satisfaction of a profile factor* regardless of the
facts.

There is no national profile* there is no Detroit

Metropolitan Airport profile* and there is no Agent
Anderson profile»
The Courts of Appeals have refused to uphold
the stops of citizens based on this prefile because of
the recommendation of the power to do sc would allow basic
searches of citizens anywhere without cause,
I would like

as far as any discretion reduc­

ing aspect of the profiles what the profile really is is
a screen for the abuse of government power because the
agents pick and choose among the many that it describes.
Finally — I see my time is short — the con­
sent to the search in this case was not freely and voluntarily given.

Schneekloth speaks of a familiar territory

case3 where it is always very congenial* the defendant
w.'S with five or six friends* where the- interrogation in
a remote station house inapposite.
the setting we have.

Here that It exactly

Sylvia Mendenhall was in that set­

ting. she was quite shaken.

Shea was not told she was

free to leave* she was lot told she had any choice about
the detention.
The first time anything about a search was

mentioned was when she was inside that room.

The first

time anything about & strip search was mentioned was after
the alleged consent was givens and then she revoked th®
consent by saying, well* I have a plane to catch and she
was told, well, if you don't have anything on you, you
don’t have anything to worry about.

She kept saying,

well, I have a plane to catch arid she was slow in taking
her clothing off.
Finally, we would contend that the alleged con­
sent here was also the product of an arrest without prob­
able cause and a stop without reasonable suspicion said
that taint was not removed.
QUESTION:

Does the record show how much of a

layover there was between the two flights?
MR. KARPONTA:
QUESTION:

No, it does not.

Then we don't know whether she was

under pressure of time or* not, do we?
MR. KARPONTA:

We do not.

It is clear that

for consent the burden is on the prosecution to show
that consent was free and voluntary.
Like Brown v« Illinois and New York v. Dunaway,
here there was a party of purposefulness and an expedi­
te '.on for evidence undertaken in the hope that something
would turn up.

We contend that the methodology here was

to cause — and this has been characterized by the

Eastern District of Michigan Court — to cause surprises,
fright and confusion.
I think the law of this Court is clear on each
of these points and* moreover, I think common sense
supports our contention,

1 think the contentions of the

government would foe basically to do away with the case by
case approach

In

Fourth Amendment cases and this our

Constitution does not allow,
QUESTION:

Mr, Karfonta, before you sit down9

you take the position that had she refused — that the
record shows that if she had refused to go to the office,
that the officers would have required her to do, that
they had inter.led: to detain her.

Do you have any posi­

tion on what the record indicates would have, happened if
after the .female officer had com© into the room and told
■*
her to take her clothes off, that if she had refused to
do that, what would have happened?
MR. KARFQHTA:
QUESTION:

(no response)

You do say that she didn't realize

until that happened that she was going to foe — that
there was going to foe a strip search.

Does the record

tell us what she would have done and what would have
happened if she had refused to take that additional step?
MR, XARFOMTA:

I believe defense counsel cross-

examined both the agent and the female officer as to each

50
point — was she free to go at the point of the stop» was
sh® free to g© at the point of arrest, was she free to go
at the point of consent,, and at ©ash point the answer was
no,
I would like to clarify one point of my posi­
tion that you just mentioned in your question, and that
was —» I*m not sure I can remember it, but our position
on the consent to the detention is that the record is
barren of any consent and therefore the District Court
was clearly erroneous,
QUESTION:

Well, there is testimony at page 12

of the appendix by the officer that before she went to
the office she gave some kind of consent, and I thought
it read consent to the search of the purse and the person..

Mu I wrong or that?
MR. KARFONTA:

What it says here is, "I asked

h:r to accompany myself and Agent Myhills to our office
which was very nearby," but there is nc indication that
she was told she had any choice.

There is no' indication

of any written or oral consent and the record does show
that she was so nervous at that point that she could
hardly speak nor return her identification to her purse.

Suppose we thought there was probable cause to

51
arrest in the offices what would your argument be then?
MR. KARFOHTA:

I suppose my argument would be

at that point that if there were no exigencies* that a
search warrant should have been sought.
QUESTION:

Well* there is probable cause to

arrest and you claim there was an arrest.

You argue; con­

sistently all through that there was an arrest.
MR*. KARFONTA:
QUESTION:

That9s correct.

WeXl9 you don't need a warrant to

search incident to arrest, do you?
MR. KARFONTA:
QUESTION:

Mo., you don't,

And you don't need a warrant to

arrest on probable cause.
MR. KARFONTA:
QUESTION:

No.

So what would fee your argument if

we disagreed with you about probable cause?

The District

Court found probable cause.
MR. KARFONTA:

The District Court actually —

and I’m glad you give me a chance to clarify this — I
think the District Court was wrong.

The District Court

said that at the point they first reached the office,
there was no probable cause.

Where the District Court

found probable cause was after they went through her
purse.

That is where the District Court found probable

cause.

And although I disagree with that, the District

52
Court specifically s&id no probable cause when they first
got to the office.

MR. XAEFONT.i:

At what point did the officers find

out that she had three different names, that is two in

Suppose we find that the officers, contrary to

your position, the officers validly acquired probable
cause at some point prior to the search, prior to the "
strip search, would you say you have lost your case or
not, or would you have some other argument?
MR, KARFONTA:

Well, I guess I would say at

that point that it would be a search Incident to arrest *

That sounds like —

MR. KARFONTA:

At the point that they have

consent to search her purse, I would contend that that

QUESTION:

You say you would argue it would be

MR,. KARFGNTA;

Or an illegal stop.

MR., CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Frey?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FRETs ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER ~~ REBUTTAL
MR. FRET:

Yes, I have e couple of minor points

and one I think of fairly major importance that I hope to
be able to talk about.
The first point is on the question of where she
was golngs whether she was going on American Airlines.
You are being asked to take Judicial notice of facta for
the first time in the Supreme Court.

I think there is a

lot of difficulty with doing that In a case where the
respondent’s own lawyer in the District Court was hot
aware of this supposedly obvious factor.

Indeed, every­

body conceded in the District Court that she was. changing
her flight and the whole case was argued, on that basis.
There was no exploration ora cross-examination, and the
Fourth Amendment does not require that he be right in
hia belief that she was changing flights but only that
he have some basis that would add to his suspicion.
Mow. with regard to Brown v. Texas, it has
absolutely no bearing on this case because in From v.
Texas, Brown was convicted of failing to give his

Identification after* having been lawfully stopped.

It

would ha%re availed the -State of Texas nothing to argue
that he was not stopped in that case, since that would
have been a confession of error, and the Court makes quite
clear in its opinion that since the conviction can be sus­
tained only if he was lawfully stoppedt the question is
whether the facts known justified a stop.

There was no

occasion in Brown to discuss whether the initial encounter
was a stop,
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Frey, on your direct argu­

ment 5 your initial argument you weren’t taking any posi­
tion on whether there was or was not probable cause to
arrest,

I take it then I really judge the case on the

assumption that there never was probable cause to arrest
prior to the search?
MR. PREY:

Well, that raises the problem of

what we’ve presented to the Court in our petition for
certiorari and whether you are free — I mean the
District Court did find that there was probable cause to
arrest and search —
QUESTION:

Do you defend that or not?

MR. PREY:

We haven’t asked for review on that

ground, but I would defend that.

I think —

4

QUESTION:

Well, the Court of Appeals thought

there wasn’t probable cause.

55
MR. PREY:

I understand that,

QUESTION:

So we judge the case on the assumption

that the officers never validly acquired, probable cause to
arrest?
MR, PREY:

I think you would certainly be well

within propriety to do so since we didn’t challenge that
conclusion of the District Court.
Now, let me get to the critical point in this
case which is the question of whether there 'was a flimsy
basis for the stop, assuming that the Court determines
that this was a Fourth Amendment seizure of her person.
There is a wide gulf between the respondent’s position
and ours, and I think respondent’s position is that you
must have virtually probable cause in order to have a
stop on founded suspicion, and his reference to Draper
was extremely revealing because, of course, the question
in Draper was probable cause and not founded suspicion.
Now, in the present case Agent Anderson had
ten years of experience in drug enforcementand was many
months stationed at the Detroit airport.

Now, during

this period he received specialized training and he
watched tens of thousands, probably hundreds of thousands
of passengers and participated in a substantial number of
drug arrests.
Now, when he saw respondent deplane and scan

56
nervously, as though looking for surveillance, it doss not
strain credulity to accept that Agent Anderson knew the
difference between the nervousness of people who are
scared of flying, worried about missing a connection —
QUESTION:

Can you tell us how often he was

MR. FREY:

The record does not tell you.

QUESTION:

He was right this time, but we don't

wrong?

know whether maybe one out of ten or nine out of ten.
MR. FREY:

But what we are talking about, the

record does not indicate, although there is an opinion
which does in the Garcia case in the Eastern District of
New York which ln&5cates that very few people are stopped*
In that particular case, they had watched nine flights
come in during the day before they stopped a single —
approached a single person and in that case it was X
think quite clearly a stop.

We are not talking about

picking large numbers of people out.

We are not talking

about an invidious selection of people for stopping.
QUESTION:

You’re not, but if I understood

your answer to Mr. Justice White, your position if sus­
tained in this case would allow you to make virtually
random stops if you could get the kind of sequence of
events you got here,
MR. FREY;

The first position that this is

57
not a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment
would, allow a police officer without violating the Fourth
Amendment to approach somebody and ask a question, that’s
correct.
QUESTION:

And the sequence cf events ends up

in an office upstairs in the airport with the suspect
taking his clothes off?
MR, FREY:

The Fourth Amendment would be impli­

cated at that point, at the point of the search.
QUESTION:

But not violated.

MR. FREY:

But not violated in these events.

QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, as I under­

stand your argument, it would not be random stops if all
of these facts existed.
MR. FREY:

I5ve now moved to the argument about

whether there is founded suspicion if this is a stop and
there we are saying that the Fourth Amendment does apply,
and I am saying that we have a very limited intrusion
and the experience of the agents —
QUESTION:

If this issue which you now describe

as critical we need address only if we are ret persuaded
on the consent sequence?
MR. FREY:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

If there was consent all along the

line, Tv-® don’t have to decide that.

53
ME, WBEIi

You would have to decide it — you

have to decide with respect-

to the initial encounter in

the airport concourse whether (a) it was not a Fourth
Amendment seizure or (b) if it was it was lawful * because
otherwise what ensued following that encounter was argu­
ably a fruit of the initial illegality.

So the consents

we are only relying on the conserat in the sense that
her voluntary cooperation at this stage in showing her
identification —
QUESTION:
things o

Well, perhaps a combination of

You of course argue in part that the initial

encounter was nothing more than asking a bystander a
question, in effect,

If we accepted that point and

everything after that was consent, then we wouldn’t have
to reach the —
MR. PREY:

You would not have to reach the

question of whether there was founded suspicion or prob­
able cause at any point, that is correct.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:17 o’clock a.m.«, the case In
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
