ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID KLINGSBERG, ESQ *,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KLINGSBERG;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari for
Supreme Court of Alabama, which up-held

a

the

death sentence

based on a conviction for the crine of robbery where the
victim was intentionally killed.

The grant of certiorari

was limited to the narrow question of whether a sentence of
death constitutionally «my be imposed after a jury verdict
of guilt of a capital offensa where a jury was not permitted
to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser included ioncapital offense and when the evidence would have supported
such s verdict.
As to the second condition in Your Honors’ grant
of certiorari, the state has conceded that there was suf­
ficient evidence to support the conviction of a lesser
included offense either of robbery or felony murder, both of
-which are non-capital offenses in Alabama.
The evidence supporting the lesser offense, briefly

4
stated# is as follows.

Petitioner confessed that he and

another man named Roy Clements participated in a robbery in
which the victim was killed.

Petitioner, however, took the

stand on his ora behalf and testified that he did not; do the
killing# that Mr. Clements did the killing, that when
Mr. Clements did do the killing, petitioner immediately
protested, "Oh, my God, what did you do?" at which point hr
left the premises.

He denied having any weapon.

He denied

intending to kill.

He said that even though there was a

discussion prior to the robbery, tying up the victim

there

was no discussion or intention of harming or killing the
victim.
The principal evidence against the petitioner was
the testimony of the woman who was described by petit loner
as an accomplice and

&.

lookout, which she denied.

She testi­

fied that petitioner had been sharpening a knife before the
robbery.

That was also denied by petitioner and contra­

dicted by other evidence.
The trial judge, following the dictates of the
statute in Alabama, did not charge the jury that it could
fii 1 petitioner guilty of a lesser included offense.
Moreoever, the trial judge told the jury that if it acquitted
the defendantr.he could never be tried' for anything that he
did tc the victim.

The Alabama circuit court# intermediate

court, said that this instruction was in accordance with the

5
Alabama statute.
Q

We contend principally—

You went also to the Supreme Court of Alabama

on the case?
MR. KLINGSBERG?
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And what question did you raise there?

MR, KliINGSBERG:

The petition for writ of certiorari

which, incidentally , was not originally in. the record, but we
had it sent up, a certified copy—said that the statute
violates the Constitution of the United States of America in
that it violates provisions in the Constitution under the
Eighth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution
of the United ' States and is in fact a mandatory death
sentence.

The arguments which had

been made below .In a

motion to quash the indictment on similar grounds, indicating
that the procedure was akin to or in the nature of a mandatory death sentence, specifically referred to the choice
which the jury was giver of either, one extreme, acquitting
\

the defendant or, the other extreme, convicting of the
capital offense-

It is true that unfortunately even though

extensive arguments were made in the circuit court.directly
on the point of the lesser included offense, that that was
although in the petition, not in the brief to the Supreme
Court of Alabama»

However, the Supreme Court of Alabama did

affirm on the basis of its decision in the Jacobs case,
which dealt only with federal constitutional issues, dealt

6

at length with the lesser included offense issue, and there
were two dissents which also incorporated and referred
directly to their decisions in Jacobs which dealt prac­
tically entirely with this lesser offense question.

So, I

think there is not any doubt that this was considered by the
Alabama Supreme Court.

And the question has been preserved.

Moreover, the state does not challenge'that, at least on the
due process question, only on the equal protection argument.

Q

Getting back to the facts, Mr. Klingsberg, I

correctly or not got the impression from you or your statsment of the facts that your client was just along, just
present.

But is it not a fact that he held the victim while

the. attacks were going on?
MR. KLINGSBERGs

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

The petitioner testified that they did lave an intention to
ti ' up the victim and that he in fact had grabbed the viccim
from behind in order to tie him up and that at that point
Mr. demerits suddenly and to the petitioner’s surprise
attacked him with a knifa,
Q

Any evidence in the case about two knives

being preeonfc, the one that was said to have been sharpened
by Beck?
MR. KLXHGSBERGi
testimony.

Mo, Your Honor, there was no such

The critical point.from the point of view of the

legal issue presented here I think is that there was a very
sharp issue, very hotly contested issue on the question of

?
intent to kill.

This made it particularly important that

the Xesser-included-offens© verdict be given to the jury as

an option because the jury without it was placed in an
impossible position«

The jury was faced, on -the one hand,

with the possibility of convicting of a capital offense, and
the only alternative

was acquittal of a defendant who was

ad: dttedly and confessed to a very serious crime.

And we say

that under these circumstances, tie jury would plainly have
veered away from acquittal in its deliberations, particularly
when attempting to resolve this delicate issue of intent to
kill.

If the jury's thoughts drifted toward the possibility

of no intent, finding of no intent, then they would have to
think, "Well, we heave to acquit this defendant.”

And the

idea of acquitting a defendant whc was guilty of a vary
serious crista, guilty of a crime of robbery in which a victim
was killed, would foe so repulsive to the jury that that would
upset and steer off course the accuracy of their finding on
the issv.s of intent to kill.
Q

Mr. Klingsberg.—

MR. l.LXNGSBERG i

Q

Yes.

“-let me get back a monent to that earlier

question 1 asked you.

In the opinion of the Supreme Court

of Alabama, which 2 take it was delivered, by Mr. Justice
Maddox, he starts out saying,

“Petitioner Beck raises only

on© issue hare, ! and then there is a colon.

Then he says,

8
"Whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals erred in its
finding that the Alabama death penalty statute is not in
violation of Article III, Section 43, Article V, Section 124,
and Amendment 38 of the 1501 constitution of Alabama."

Do

you disagree with that characterisation of the-MR, KLXNGSBERGi

Yes, four Honor, 1 disagree with

that because of the petition for certiorari to the Alabama
Supreme Court which explicitly refers to the Eighth, Sixth,
and Fourteenth Amendments,

And 1 disagree with it because I

think the court actually considered that, in light of its
reference and incorporation of the Jacobs case.
1 should also note that there was a rule in the
Alabama Supreme Court which was enacted before the appeal
but became effective before the appeal was decided, which
enabled the Supreme Couru to consider any important issues
in cases such as this.
Q

Counsel, of course there are cases where—we

have had them here, and X have had more of them on fell® Court
of Appeals--where defense counsel prefer to have only the most
serious presented to the jury and do away with lesser included
offenses in the thought that the evidence is shaky enough
that a j iry will not con'rich of the most serious offense
where they might opt for a lesser included one.

And you do

nov pursue that here,
MR. KLXNGSBERG3

I think there is no question, Your

9

Honor-—and the question is not raised by respondent~-that
thi s matter was raised very distinctly at. the trial court
le al.

And there was a motion to quash the indictment as

contrary to rights under the Constitution..

It was raised on the motion to quash.

acquittal.

It was

raised at transcript £27 at the end of the prosecution1s crsa,
And there was an exception to the charge also referring to
lesser included offenses at transcript 748.
So, I think the matter was definitely raised in the
District Court.

There was no point in requesting the charge

because the statute explicitly precluded it.

But it was

rai sed in the motion to quash.
Q

To entitles a defendant tc a lea ser-included -

offensa charge, do you contend that there need be no evidence
at all with respect to some lesser included offense r.s just
an absolute right?
MR. KXNGSBERGs

We contend that there had ho be

some evidence, and the state concedas that there was some
evidence.

And I have described that evidence, which was

based principally on feha fact that petitioner took the
stand in his own behalf.

He was the only eye-witness.

The

10
testimony against him was circumstantial»

And there was

other evidence in addition»
Q

You say the testimony against him was circum­

stantial?
MR. KLXNG3BERG;
Q

Yes. Your Honor.

X thought you just also told us he admitted

presence at the crime, the scene of the crime , and holding
the victim at the time the

victim was, as he, says, murdered

by someone else, not by him.
MR. KLINGSBKRG:
C

On the intent to kill—

That is more than circumstantial, is it not?

MR. XtLXNGSBERG:

I am speaking simply of the

intent issue.
Q

Are you saying that unless the defendant

admits that he had the intent to kill, the evidence of his
intent to kill is necessarily circumstantial?
MR. KLXNGSBERG:

No.

X think that, for example,

if the petitioner did not take the stand at all, it might be
as uad that there was not sufficient evidence.

But there is

no question that when the petitioner takes the stand and
denies intent to kill, that there was sufficient evidence,
for example, under the Alabama law which applies to non­
capital cases and in respect cf the laws of every other
state which provides for lesser included offenses, which
requires that charge to be given.

11
Q

But the jury is entitled to disbelief of

petitioner„
MR. KLXKGSBERGs
C

Oh, yea,

But your point is that if they believed his

testimony that he was just holding the man and that the
other fellow did the cutting with the knife, then he should
be found guilty, could be found guilty of some lesser
included offense.
MR. KLSNGSBERGs
hi:

That ar.d if they also believed

testimony that both before and during the course of the

cr .me, thrt he had no intent to harm or kill the victim.
Q

I have trouble with this lesser.

What lessor

included defense did the state agree he could be convicted of?
MR. KLXNGSBERGs
Marshall.

There were two, Mr. Justice

One was felony murder, which is not a capital

offense in Alabama» and the second was robbery.
Q

You mean a man that holds a victim while he is

stabbed con be acquitted of homicida?
MR. KLZNGSSERG:

He can be acquitted of robbery

with intent to kill, if the only basis for his holding was,
as he testified,, to tie up the victim rather than to cause
him ham or kill him.

Q

Is it not true under these cases the nan

could net have gotten stabbed if hs hud not been held?
MR. KLINGSBERGs

That may be.

12
Q

That is Eiy problem®

MR* KLIMG3BERGs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Is not robbery with intent to kill by defini­

tion, if you succeed in the robbery, you are not going to
kill the man?
MR. KLXNGSBERG:

I do not think that is necessarily

true.
Q

Under Alabama law, robbery with intent to kill

means that you plan to first rob him and then kill him?

m, KLIHGSBERG:

X do not

difference what the order is.

think it makes any

It has to be robbery where

the victim is killed intentionally by the defendant.
Row, if Your Honors

please, the absence of the

le■ ■ aer-ineluded-offense instruction and the appalling
prospect

filch the jury was faced with of acquitting the

defendant in light of the court's charge.

freeing- that

defendant and putting him in a position where he could never
be tried again for the crime of robbery or felony taurd&r was,
we Seif, an injection into this case of cm extraneous circum­
stance.

It was an element, a factor, which created -and

influenced -the jury perhaps in a subconscious way, in a
subtle way, that did not require that the jurors intention­
ally decide to disobey their instructions,

The jurors who

have a feeling of duty to the community, a natural impulse
to see that someone pays for a crime such as robbery where

13
a victim is killed, would naturally be repulsed by the
prospect of acquitting and freeing that defendant.

And that

factor was an influence on the jury's resolution of the
doubts regarding the intent issue.

Dae process should not

allow putting the jury in a position where if it doss not con­
vict a defendant of a capital offense, the results will bs
inconsistent with all of the human impulses to do justice.
Q

So far than, I take it,

is not confined to death cases.

this is an argument that

I mean, this is, 1 would

suppose you would say on the due process basis that it would
lead to inaccurate verdicts in non-death cases.
MR. KLINGSBBRG:

That is what the Court held in

iCaobis against United States <,

Is that your argument?

MR. KLXNGSBERGt
Q

It sounds like if is.

MR. KLXNGSBERG:
Q

Well—

So far it does.

MR, KLXNGSBERGj
ment.

But it is not my argument.,

When are you going to limit it?

X think that it could be the argu­

It could be logic ally.

But I don't chink, particularly

in light of the narrower question on certiorari, that; the
Court has to go that far.
Q

The Court has said—

You have just beers going that far though.

That is your argument a© far..
MR. KLXNGSBERGs

The Court has said on many

14
occasions, Mr. Justice White, that higher standards of due
process are required in capital cases, that capita?, defen­
dants should be accorded all procedural safeguards.

This is

a procedural safeguard, and. I think that the Court could
decide why—
Q

I think you could certainly argue that if it

is a capital cas©, the jury might be even less willing to
convict of the greater offense.
MR. KLXNG3BERG:
Q

Yes, but I think—

Because it knows then that there would be a

chance of the death penalty even though the jury would not
impose it itself.

There would even be, I would suppose,

there would be less reason for them to convict of the greater
offens©„
MR. KLINGSBERG:

But there would also be, because

this is a capital case and because the lessor-included-offense
crime is so serious, there will also be a greater abhorrence
of letting the defendant go free—
Q

Mot just because it is a death case.

MR. KLINGSBERG*

Wo, because in this case—and 1

think probably in most death cases-—the next lasser offense
do'n is going to foe a very serious offense.

And for that

reason the jury’s reluctance to r@lea.se and free thin
defendant for all timer»
Q

X understand your argument, but I do r.ot see

15
why It is any nore telling in a death case than in any other ,
and it night even be less.
MR. KLINGSBERG:
Q

If Your Honor please, there—■

Of course 1 know you disagree with that.

MR. KLINGSBERGe

There are two points.

One is the

legal point that in a death case,, because death is irre­
versible, death is qualitatively different.

There is no

room for correction.
Q

Therefore, the jury would be more reluctant

to convict of the greater offense.
MR. KLINGSBERG *

I think the court—and the court

has said—should be more prone to apply higher standards of
due process to do more to minimize the risk of error, to do
moire to assure that the jury's resolution of doubt is a
reliable and accurate resolution of doubt.

As a matter of

fact, I think that you have to lock at the other side and say
that the jury’s reluctance to acquit and free will be much
greater where the lesser included offense is a very serious
crime, as it is here.

In Keable against united States, for example, where
the Court said that if a statute was interpreted—in that
case the Major Crimes Act—was interpreted to preclude the
Xesser-inciuded-offenee instruction, there would be serious
constitutional questions raised under the due process clause.
There the crime charged was assault with intent to injure,

IS
and the lessor offense was simple assault*

And the Court#

through Mr. Justice Brennan# held that it would go out of
its way to avoid interpreting that statute to preclude
lesser offenses even though the crime of simple assault was
no'~. independently within the jurisdiction of the Major
Crimes &ot.

The basis for that decision was that the

resolution of doubt and the intent issue# which as in this
case was very seriously in dispute, would be affected
adversely by the absen.se of the lesser offense.

2a this

case e where the crime is much more serious than simple
assault# I think that the jury's reluctance to resolve
doubts on the intent issue in favor of acquittal will be even
greater? and, therefore# both as a matter of fact and as a
matter of law, £ think that: there is basis in a capital case
for holding that lesser offense instructions are an important
procedural protection which rises to the due process level.
Q

The Keasle cane was not based on a constitu­

tional holding# was it?
Mila I&ZNGSB9RGs

The Court avoided the constitu­

tional holding which, it said# would have been presented if
it bad not. interpreted the statute—
Q

The holding is not constitutional.

MS. J&ZNGSBERGt

The holding is not constitutional#

and there has not been a constitutional holding because every
state in the union, going back many years—over a hundred

17
years—has required lesser includet' offenses.
1 think, if Your Honor please, we can also look—
Q

They have the requirement if the defense does

not want them.
MR. K&ZNGSBERG:

That is correct. Your Honor, and it

is recognised as a right of the defense as a protection which
the. defense can have if the defense wants it under the
applicable statute, the rules of procedure, or caramon law.
0

I think your response to my earlier question

really was not responsive»

Well, go ahead»

In any event,

yon went them here»
MR» RLXNGSBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

2 think in

respect of your earlier question, the fact that there have
been many cases, including cases of this Court on or about the
turn of the century involving different degrees of murder,
where the Court has said that the failure to give the
defendant the benefit of. the lesser included offense charge,
if the defendant wants it, is a protection, is a benefit, is
a procedural right, indicates that-Q

Mr* Klingsberg, what specific provision of

the Constitution have you beer arguing about so fax?
.MR» KLXNGSBERGs

We have bean arguing so fur, Your

Honor, about -the Fourteenth amendment due process clause.
Q

But just due process in general in terms of the

accuracy of -the verdict?

18
MR. KLINGSBERGs
G

That is correct# Your Honor.

Is it a deprivation of jury trial# or what

is it?
MR. KLXNGSB1RGs

It is# on®, the accuracy and

reliability of the fact finding.

It has also been held by

this Court, not specifically on constitutional grounds—
Q

I just want to know what your claims are—

MR» KLXNGSBERGs

Right.

This takes away from the

province of the jury the right to determine an important
element of the case.
Q

So# you say that is interference with the right

to jury trial?
MR. IXXNGSBERGi
Q

That is cor reset, Your Honor •

As well cs just generally it risks such

inaccuracy that, it is a violation of duo process?
MR. KLXNGSBERG3
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

It also—

Are those the only two—

MR. K&XNGSBERGi

I think it also takes away the

right to have an impartial jury because the jury necessarily
becomes biased by facing this appalling prospect of releasing
a defendant—
Q

These are the only constitutional claims you

are making?
MR. KtiXNGSEERGt

No# we are also making a claim in

regard to the Eighth Amendment

in so far as I believe that

.19

we can look to the Court8s post-Furman decisions for guidance
on what should be the standards* the standards under the due
process clause»

I think, what the Court did in the post-

Ftrroan decisions in saying that there should be rationaliza­
tion, there should be guidelines* there should be standards*
was to look to the standards that have been generally
applied in the past at the guilt-finding stage,

and I think

that all of the standards which the Court has announced in
those cases as applicable to the sentencing stage should
certainly be applied at the guilt-finding stag© as wall.
Petitioner contends that the state was attempting
to eliminate all discretion or as much discretion aa possible*
which it reads, Alabama read, misread I think, as the purpose
of the Furman decision.
Q

And that 1 think Is a quirk—

But it. is up to the judge to conduct a

sej arate sentencing hearing, X take it.
MR. KLXNGSBEEG%

Yes* Your Honor, there is a

sec-arete sentencing in Alabama.
C

And the judge determines the penalty.

MR. KLIHGSBERGs

That is correct.

But 1 think the

very same standards which this Court has applied, rationaliasing, providing guidelines, focusing on the particular
circumstances of the offense, can all be.applied to the lesser
offense instruction and he incorporated into the due process
requirements for the lesser-offense instruction.

The lesser-

20
offensa instruction deas not, as Alabama initially thought,
provide for a discretionary action by the jury.

The jury

is not asked to exercise discretion but rather is instructed
to find the correct level ©f guilt consonant with the evidence.
The evidence, the level of -the evidence is the standard, and
the lesser-offense instruction is the guideline.
Q

You do not think that due process is satisfied,

I take its» by the fact that after the jury's verdict, the
defendant, the accused has another shot at it if he can
persuade the judge that the jury verdict was too harsh on the
basis of the evidence.
MR. KLIKGSBERGs

Your Honor, 1 think the sama

standards which the Court has applied and the same careful
scrutiny which the Court has applied to the sentencing stage
of a death-penalty case should, in the case of guilt finding,
also b© applied.
0

But the jury * 3 verdict i© not final, is it, on

the issue of life or death?

No, Your Honor, it is not,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD E. CARNES, ESQ.,
ON BEHAI-'? O? THE RESPONDENT
MR. CARNESs

Mr# Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Because of all the question» about the facts and

%

21

the Alabama law and the procedural posture of the caser I
would like to devote approximately five minutes to that topic
before I turn to the merits.

The petitioner was not indicted,

tried, and convicted for the capital crime of robbery

,

during

the course of which the defendant was intentionally killed.
That is how the statute said.

But the state gratuitously

averred that the victim was murdered in the first degree by
the defendant.

And the Alabama Supreme Court has said when

we aver it, we have to prove it.

It is not a variance

between the statute and the indictment, but nonetheless wa
are stuck, so to speak, with what we say in the indictment.
The elements of that crime, as defined in Ritter
v, State—and that is the important case of the Alabama
Supreme Court on what the elements are—was robbery, which
the defendant admitted.

First degree murder of the victim

during the robbery, whicn the defendant admitted by admitting
facts sufficient to constitute felony murder, first degree
murder„
And the third element, tie crucial element,- the one
which was in some dispute at the trial, was

defined in

Ritter as related to the intent and culpability.

Ritter

said that even ".hough the» defendant did not have to actually
do the killing himself, he nonetheless—a nan-trigger man or
non-knife wielding defendant as in this case—either had to
ha a had scene kind of particularized intent that the killing

22

take place, or he had to have bear?, a knotting accomplice to
the intentional killing itself, not the robbery, but the
intentional killing»

Father went on to define "accomplice to

the intentional killing itself" as meaning that the defendant
either sanctioned or knowingly facilitated the crime., And the
facts in this case, the defendant and the co-defendant
Clements both admitted they went there and both participated
in a robbery.

They both admitted that when they left, both

victims were dead,

They of course disputed who committed

the murder, the actual stabbing or throat cutting.

Each one

blamed it on the other one and said, "Oh, 1 was just shocked,
I was appalled, I had no idea»
I found out what happened,

I was just sick at heart when

And 7 immediately repudiated it.®

In other words,, both of them admitted robbery.
Both of them admitted first degree murder.

And both of them

derled the third crucial element in Ritter.

And the evidence

on 'that third disputed element at trial was this.
admitted that, he was 12 years older than Clements.

Beck
Beck

admitted that it was he who drove to and from the crime.
Beck admitted that it was he who disposed of the victims9
wallet and purse,

reck also admitted that he held the victim

down while the victim’s throat was being cut,

Q

Mr. Carnes, just so I understand the thrust of

your comments, you are saying there is very strong evidence
supporting the intentional killing here.

23

MR, CARNES:
Q

Overwhelming»

Are you denying,, however, the fact it would

have been consistent with the evidence for the jury to have
accepted some of what the defendant said and found a lesser
included offense?
MR., CARNES:
"consistent.”

It depends on how you define the word

Consistent as a matter of Alabama state law

be ause we have such a broad lesser-included-offense permis­
sibility?
Q

Right.

MR. CARNES:

In terms of the Berra and Sansome

rational or reasonable basis, there is a very real question.
But what we concede in Section 8 of our brief is that if it
had not been for preclusion as a matter of Alabama state law,
the jury would have been instructed, not necessarily it would
have been under Berra and Sansome and certainly not that they
would have been constitutionally entitled to it.
Q

But—

But had there not been this special rule for

death cases, the defendant would have been entitled to a
ie: ,ser-included-offense instruction as a matter of Alabama

law

s

MR. CARNESs
Q

No question about, it.

I know you say not as a matter of federal

constitutional. law«
MR. CARNES:

No question about it.

Also Beck admitted that his clothing was so blood

24
stained with the blood of the victim that he had to burn it.
He admitted that he had the victim8s blood on his pants,
shirt, jacket, and boots.

Another witness whom Beck dis­

puted testified at trial that Beck was sharpening his knife
before they wont to commit the crime.
A second witness, whom Back admitted was telling
the truth about everything she testified to, testified that
after they got back, Beck said, quote, “We did it.19

And

Beck specifically admitted she told the truth about everything.
Beck himself, even though he said, "Well, I'm the one that
was surprised.

I'm the one who was shocked," he testified

co earning Ritter's condition after the crime, emotional
condition.

And this is very pertinent to who was surprised

and who was shocked.

Beck himself testified, quote, "Roy was

white as a sheet, shaking all over like a wet cold bird dog
freezing to death.”

There was no testimony in the evidence

that Back himself was so visibly shaken.

So, there was from

the undisputed evidence, also the only way Beck could have
planned to get away with this robbery was by killing the
victim because the victim, Roy Malone, knew Beck on a name
basis, knew where he lived and could identify him.
Beck said, “I was planning on going to Florida.”

Of course
But the

State of Alabama has very good extradition relationships with
fch

State of Florida, and Beck could not have imagined in any

way he could have evaded such a serious crime by merely going

25

across the state.
So, the overwhelming evidence was that Beck either
committed the nurder himself, had a particularised intent to
do so, or knowingly facilitated or sanctioned it.

Nonetheless,

as a matter of Alabama state law, because Beck got up and said,
"Notwithstanding all the evidence, I deny that 1 knowingly
facilitated it.

I facilitated it, yes, but I did not know it,

and I deny that I knew that it was going to take place,"
Alabama law, under the Davis decision specifically cited in
that case, says that if there is any evidence barring pre­
clusion, statutory preclusion, if there is any evidence
whatever, quote, “however insufficient or lacking in credi­
bility,1* end of quote, only an entire absence of evidence can
you preclude it common law.

And because of that, we concede

as a matter of Alabama state law that had .it not been for -the
st- tutory preclusion clause, the instruction would have been
given enabling the jury to convict on those lower offenses.
But new it is important to distinguish between determining
that a lesser included offense occurred and convicting on the
lesser included, offense.
The Alabama capital punishment statute dose not
preclude the jury from determining that the defendant was
only guilty of u lesser offense.

Instead, what the Alabama

statute does is preclude them from convicting on that lesser
offense and say, “If you determine that he is guilty of only

26
the lesser offense, you acquit, him of that higher capital
offense.30

from considering the fact that he may have just been guilty of

MR. CARNESs

Turning now to the issues on the merits*, all of the
constitutional issue» involved in this case depend actually
on the answer to one question, and that question is essen­
tially, Does preclusion .in the special context of the Alabama
statute jeopardise the reliability of fact finding and under­
mine the reasonable doubt standard in cases tried under that
statist©?

If this Court determines, viewing the statute ant

its particularities, if this Court determines that the answer
to that question is yes, then the preclusion clause is
unconstitutional and should in fact be struck down.
However, if this Court determines that the answer
to that crucial question is .no, then just as clearly and just
a© certainly the preclusion clause should be upheld find the
statute's validity affirmed.
It is our position that preclusion does not under­
mine the reasonable doubt standard and dess not jeopardize
the reliability of fact findingv at least not in the context
of Alabama’s statute", Which has special procedural safeguards
three of these.

The first is the requirement that the jury,

30
in its verdict form, fix the penalty of death even though
the jury has no role in the sentencing process and the
and not the jury sentences.

judge

The requirement that the jury

fix the penalty at death-““-and no defendant can be convicted
of a capital offensa in Alabama unless that jury verdict form
says, "And we fix the penalty or punishment at death"--is for
the specific purpose of calling upon the jury's historical
reluctance and caution,, some of which Mr. Justice White
mentioned earlier, ir- capital cases.

■

And the historical

evidence we have set out in ou.r brief on pages 17 to 21 shows
the jurorc in capital cases are extremely reluctant to con­
vict when death appears to be the result.

They resolve all

doubt© on guilt or innocence—on guilt or innocence —in favor
of the defendant, not the state.
capital cases.

It. is different from non­

And the evidence shows that if they do dis­

obey their instructions, it is to favor capital defendants
and not the state.
This Court in the cases we cite in our brief has
relied upon that difference in capital as versus non-capital
cases in decisions in the past.

q

Are you

saying that under the Alabama systes

the jury that had any inclination to find & lesser included;

verdict as they did but with no recommendation on the death

31
MR. CARNES:

No, sir.

tions had not been—
Q

And there would be nothing for the judge to

veto.
MR» CARNES:

That is not a permissible verdict form.,

If the jury comes back with that form in Alabama, that is not
a resolution of the case.
Q

What if they split?

MR. CARNES:

Q

If they split, there is a mistrial.

Any one juror can refuse to vote for the death

penalty?
MR. CARNES?
Q

Yea, sir.

And then it will just be a new trial.

MR. CARNES'i-

Yes, sir, which its a. safeguard, the

second safeguard in our statute, because the statute says if
there is a mistrial either because of a failure to agree on
guilt or innocence, or bscans© somebody does not want to
write, “Fisc the penalty at death*5—
Q

If all 12 of them do not want to fix the

penalty at death, fcher© Is going to bo a new trial.

Q

there is a mistrial, and there is the possi­

bility tiie reindictment option—the statute specifically
providas that after a mistrial because of the failure of the
jury to agree, the state can g© back and reindict on a non-

32

capital lessor included offense.

And the jury in this case

was specifically instructed about that possibility.

And one

of the defendant Back’s two retained attorneys at trial even
mentioned or alluded to it in his oral argument*
"look, do not b© stampeded»

He said»

Do not ba rushed into this thing *

If I have any possibility under a reindictment or otherwise
to take my man before the bar of justice and plead him guilty
to.these lesser offenses cf murder or robbery, I will do it.
■I will do it, but do not be stampeded.®
And then the judge told them if they returned a
failure to agree on the penalty of death, on guilt or
innocence, that there would be a possibility of the reindict­
ment,

Of course the state controls the reindictsaent option»

The state determines that.

But just by telling the jury that

there is a possibility of that, the importance is it is a
safeguard.

They say the jury, if he is gUilfcy of a serious

non—-a lesser included offense such as robbery or murder,
fch«

jury may feel compelled to convict an innocent man,

in ocent of the capital offense, just to keep from letting
him go.
Q

Mr. Attorney General, what happen® if the jury

came in and said, "W© convict him of second degree murder"?
MR. CARNES:
You cannot do that.®

The judge would say, "No, you do not.
He would either interpret that as an

acquittal, which there would be very strong arguments for, or

33

declare a mistrial, depending on whether his instructions
had been clear or not.

The importance of the mistrial option

is that if the jury does disobey the instructions—they say,
"Okay, the guy—we've get a reasonable doubt of the capita.!
offense but we do not want to let him go/1 it gives them a way
out.

It is a safeguard, a stop measure»
And the Ksefcle case was different.

The dictum or

the reasoning in the Reekie case was different on these two
particularities•

There was no verdict form convicting the man

in setting his penalty or his punishment at death.

There

was no calling upon the traditional reluctance and caution
of jurors in capital cases®

Also there was no mistrial and

reindictment option.
Of course the jury in that case could have mistried,
as any jury can.
.gu3

But they were not told that if the guy was

only a lesser included, he could be reindicted.

And in distinguishing our case—
0

Of course he could not.

The reason they war©

not told so in Kaeble was I think even the court opinion did
not Ind:’ cat© that he could have been indicted in the first
instance for the lesser included offensa—
MR. CARNES 8
G

Exactly*

—in a federal district court since that court

had only the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Congress.
MR. CARNES s

And as the district court and court

of appeals interpreted, he could; not have been convicted of a

Q

And Alabama’s policy in non-death casas is

directly to the contrary.
MR. CARNESs

yes, sir, Tour Honor, but as Furman

posed, capital sentencing 1b different from all other sentending either as a minimal constitutional requirement or as
taking the valuer? and policies of Furauan even further.

And

there is a very strong indication that Alabama did write on
a

-lean slat© after Gregs', Proffitt, and «Tarek made it clear

preclusion was not constitutionally required because in 1977,
& year after the 876 cases from this Court, Alabama passed a
new criminal cede which totally restructured and redefined
i

everything from trespass’tag tc homicide.

And in that new

criminal code a year after. Gregg, Proffitt, and JUret, the
Alabama legislature incorpprafced by reference and' thereby
readopted the Alabama capital punishsaont statute, including
the preclusion clause.

And we think that evidences that, the

purpose “—at least as of 1977 and arguably as early as ‘75 when
the statute was originally enacted —was to go beyond the
requirements of Furraar: »

Otherwise, why would they not have*

left it in there a£her this Court made clear in *76 it was

38
not constitutionally required?

And everything is geared in

the statute towards the preclusion of lesser included offenses
It is especially important in Alabama statutes because, for
example, the verdict form requirement—that is the way where
you insist that the jury proceed as cautiously and as reluc­
tantly as possible to protect the reliability of fact finding.
But if you do not have preclusion and you have got a verdict
form where the jury says# *l?@ fix his penalty at death,"
absent preclusion, where are you?

You are back at Roberta.

You are back at Woodson, where this Court said -there would

like there is.

Q

One would not assume so from that.

X have Jacobs against State before me.

It says

that under the Alabama scheme, if the jury refuses to follow
the legislative mandate end does not fix the penalty at
death, the statutory scheme acts as a form of safety valve
favorable to the accused because if one single juror refuses
to follow the legislative mandate and refuses to fix the
penalty at death, the trial court raay grant a mistrial, and
that is what the statute says too.

They point to the

Ninety-six percent. "My goodness, how

can you say innocent men are not being convicted wrongfully?
Ninety-six percent."

The whole point in that is that pre­

clusion, as this Court recognised in Keeble, was for the
purpose of protecting—historically was for the purpose of
protecting the prosecutor, not the defendant.

And any

prosecutor who knows he does not have the protection of lesser
included offenses because of that preclusion clause is going
to be extremely reluctant ana extremely hesitant to bring any
case as a capital case unless he is absolutely certain that
not only is the man guilty, but he can prove it beyond a
reasonable doubt.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have a few minute.3

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID KLINGSBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KLINGSBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The so-called historical evidence which tha
respondent cites concerning jury's reluctance to convict of
a capital crime, based on our reading of the cases in
respondent's brief, is only in mandatory capital sentencing.

45
The implication of the argument is that there should be
reduced standards, reduced procedural protections in capital
cases.

And the Court has consistently said that because of

the irreversibility and the absence of any opportunity for
correction of error, that there should be greater standards
and that there should be greater procedural protections and
more reliability in a capital case.
Mistrial is not a substitute for the lesserincluded-offense procedure.

This postulates a situation

where the jurors would say to ©ash other, "We really think
the defendant is guilty only of a lesser included offense.
So, what we will do is w® will go and tell the trial judge
that some of us vote to convict, soma of us vote to ^'acquit.
Then there will be a mistrial.

tod then maybe, if the

statute does not require it, there will be a reindictment,
arid maybe that reindictrent will fee for the lesser offense,
and maybe there will be a conviction."

tion on such a tenuous -chain of ©vents cannot bs a substitute

bias»

That is not discretion.

That is what this Court has

said ia the controlled, guided exercise of discretion, which
is what is suppose to happen in the guilt-finding stage.
Q

But in the guilt-finding stage, does it not

afe least tend to eliminate the arbitrariness that was criti­
cised in Furman if the jury is forced to fish or cut bait as
to whether this man either committed a capital offense or did
not commit it?
I I. KLZMGSElBOi

Not as Furman was subsequently

interpreted and clarified in that where the jury is given
instructions and told to act on the basis of standards, that
is not•somei&irg which Furman condemned, as the Court
indicated in Gregg an£* the. subsequent cases,

ted it is s

misinterpretation of Furman, as the Court said in Jurek and
Pi~ffitto
Q

Yes, but that was with respect to the penalty.

Q

That was the penalty.

MR. KLIMGSBERGs

Yes, Your Honor.

I think the

same thing should apply at the guilt-finding stage»
Q

I know you do.

I know you do„ but none of

our cases say that»
MR. KL1NGSBERGs

I think that Mr, Justice Stewart,

for example, in Gregge when he was talking about why there
should be instructions and why the jury should be guided and
standardised cm sentencing# said that the reason for that
is because that is what juries always are asked to do at the
guilt-finding stage.

And ©11 of those standards, I think#

ars adopted and imported into the sentencing stage fro®
traditional standards which are applied at the guilt-finding
stage.

I think that the state has no interest here.

Clearly

this ie something which is a misreading and a misinterpretation
of Furman and

therefore should be set aside,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*
