ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICfMRD CHARLES BOCKEN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. BOCKEN:

12

13

14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here upon a grant of a writ of

3

11

certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.

I believe that this is a

.unique case which will require this Court to distinguish be­
tween federal regulatory authority and the public navigation
servitude.
The issue presented is as follows:

Does the pri-

vie.tely funded improvement of a private pond which is the
15
16

legal equivalent of fast land when that pond is connected to
navigable waters of the United States thereby become burdened

17
with a public navigation servitude even though no public
18
funds are involved.

QUESTION:

Mr. Boeken, was there a natural opening

between the pond and 'the bay?

QUESTION:

MR. BOCKEN:

In its natural state, it was separated,

24
the pond was separated from the bay, from the sea by a

barrier3 a beach barrier.

2

natural, or not, I don't know3 but an ancient Hawaiian history

3

in the use of the pond as a fish pond, there were sluice

4

gates that x*?ere narrow in nature which did exist when they

5

were placed there — history doesn't tall us, Your Honor.

fchi ik this is a private pond which had no access to the sea
24

prior to the development stage in the sixties.
25

At that time,

5
1

there was no evidence —- and I think the government will con­

2

cede this — there was no traffic between the pond and the

3

sea except I suppose you could physically somewhere carry a

4

small flat bottom boat over the barrier beach and place It in

the sea.

the barrier beach which had been there for centuries separated

Well, were they barriers enough to keep

fish in?

15

17

Well, I don’t know, Your Honor, if they

would be referred to as artificial barriers,

13
14

But it was opening up to the sea, that

some artificial barriers were placed between the pond and the

11
12

But certainly three sides it was just land and then

That’s correct, they were sluice —
So if they hadn’t placed the barriers

there they would have lost some fish?
MR. BOCKEN:
QUESTION:
MR. BOCKEN:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
By their swimming to the ocean.
They may have flushed out with the tide,

Your Honor, right.
But for centuries and under unique Hawaii law, the
fish ponds were always considered to be private property,
They were never considered to be part of the sea.

They were

considered to be part of the land and under Hawaii law these

6
1

ponds, the title to them could be transferred.

In some cases

2

they were described In land commission awards, some of them,

3

as this pond was. was Included within a parcel of land which

4

was owned by the Bishop Estate, the Bishop Estate being an

5

educational trust created for the supporting of the Hawaii

6

Kassehameha School System, and this particular pond was located

7

within a parcel which was owned and had been owned for a long

8

period by the Bishop Estate, and while owned by the estate it

9

was leased out to various individuals for* use as a fish pond.

10

It was, as 1 mentioned before, not navigable in its

11

natural condition and its private nature had been recognized

12

for centuries, through ancient Hawaiian custom as outlined

13

extensively In our brie? by Hawaii law and by federal law

14

upon annexation of the territory as a state in the union, and

15

that annexation act is codified, which is called the Organic

16

Act, is codified at 48 U.S. Code 506, and it recognised these

17

18

anclant Hawaiian rights to fish ponds.

In short, they were

treated as private land, as the equivalent, the legal

19

equivalent of fast land just as a farm or a house lot would

20

be considered.

21
22

23
24
25

They were not considered separately as part

of the sea.
QUESTION:

If the government were to come in and

have condemned this particular fish pond, the items which
were compensable and went to measuring compensable value, it
would have been determined by federal law, wouldn’t they?

owner would have to be campensat ed.
QUESTION:

Well, sure he would have to be compensated,,

but the question is what elements go into the making up of
that value that he is ultimately paid.

MR, BOCKEN:

No, but there are property taxes and

there have been real property taxes paid on this poind for I
don't know how many years, forever as far as I know, and the
real property taxes are paid just like any other real
property taxes.

So it is treated, the same as the farm In

Iowa, the land in Florida.

There is no legal difference in

I

the treatment of the two.

shorthand for the fact that when you are condemning land or

Justice’s hypothetical and have this inland pond, separated by
distinctly fast land from navigable ocean water and the Corps
of Engineers decides that it wants to improve Maunalua Bay

it to the interior pond, do you think it has to pay compensa­

Yes, Your Honor.

There were two parts to the Court of

The court first held that this is a

navigable water of the United States and therefore subject to
federal regulations.

That question has not been presented to

presenting is whether a different test of navigable waters

about the public right of navigation as opposed to the federal

They may have that right under the

whether there has been a compensable taking.

QUESTION:

7

MS. OBERLY:

You said they might have to pay.
That's correct, if the government under­

8

took an activity that was truly on fast land, but our position

9

here is that this fish pond has always both before and after

10

the improvements been a navigable water of the United States

11

and for that reason compensation would not be owed for any­

12

thing that the government might choose to undertake in the
fish pond.

QUESTION:

14

regulation that you have to treat it as a taking?

22

MS. OBERLY:

23

You get to that question only if you

assume that the pond is fast land and always has been.

If

.

25

the pond itself is navigable waters of the United States, then

25
1

the whole line of this Court's compensation cases such as

2

Rands dictate that the government does not pay when it ex­

ercises the navigation servitude in those areas.

no compensation is owed is not because we are exercising the

navigation servitude.

It pre-dates the Commerce Clause, al­

though it is protected by the Commerce Clause» but our posi­
tion is that we would agree with petitioners that the servi­
tude is not as broad as the government's powers under the
Commerce Clause.

I think what the petitioners want the Court

to believe is that our position is the navigation servitude
goes as far as the government’s Commerce Clause powers on
dry land, and that is not what we are saying at all.
QUESTION:

The government did institute a condemna­

tion proceeding for the Port of Portland, but it is Just a
question of how much the fast land owner should be paid.

It

wasn’t the idea that the Columbia River could simply be

enlarged by plowing into it a whole bunch of fast land under
the commerce power and the government pay nothing.
MS. OBERLY:

We concede completely that when the

gove?rnment takes fast land above the line of mean high tide
under the Commerce Clause, we would pay for that, although as

25

of Rands we would not pay any special value for its riparian

It is

What we are saying is that when

the Corps of Engineers regulates in navigable waters of the
United States, the reason it regulates is for the purpose of
keeping those waters open and usable for public navigation.

with navigable water, the two are coextensive?

You just told me that, it is no broader

than the servitude.
MS. OBERLY:

there is no question about the fact that that lake belongs to

Is that correct?

MS. OBERLY:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Ms. Oberly, is the same true of a rail­

road, say, that goes from Ohio to Indiana?

Coneededly, the

Commerce Clause authorises a great deal of regulation which
has been exercised by the Interstate Commerce Commission.

Do

you think the Congress can say to the railroad, we want you
to carry all passengers free on this railroad without ©zer­
oising any condemnation authority?
MS. OBERLY:

Qu?r position is not that the regulatory

23

power under the Commerce Clause authorizes the free access, it
24

is the public’s right to navigate which pre-dates the Commerce

clause.

QUESTION:

MS. OBERLY:

Now, suppose he wants to sell his

That is because he has merged his water

8

with the public’s waters*at no cost to him he has obtained use

9

of the public's waters.

Our position is simply that no

10

private person has a right to connect his land or his water

11

to the public’s waters without the government’s permission,

12

anc that as a condition for that permission it is not at all
unreasonable

to require that the public's waters from the

13

in either event, the government could dredge the pond, the

opening and then provide for public access.

15

QUESTION:

But

I thought I caught something you said a

few moments ago that if the aperture to the sea were sealed

zo
21

25

MS. OBERLY:

As it stands now, the petitioners do

not have the authority to close, off the opening to the sea,
but if the government wanted to close off the opening for the
Interests of navigation, then the government would have the
authority to do that.

The petitioners would be denied access

to the opening and they would not be entitled to compensation
because they do not own access, but they probably would be

38
1

free to return to their fish pond operations and use it as a

2

fish pond.

4

QUESTION:

But they are still using that public

water that you placed so much reliance on.

5

MS. OBERLY:

Well* we would be cutting off their

6

use of the waters from the bay and they would no longer

7

continue to flow in.
I would like to go back for a minute to explain why

3
9

we believe the Commerce Clause test of navigability is the

10

one that also governs the test for public right of naviga­

11

tion, and It is simply a matter of common sens®.
We believe that the principal reason the govern­

12
13

ment’s regulatory power over navigation even exists is to

14

protect the public's right to navigate.

15

sense to give the Corps of Engineers sweeping powers to pro­

16

hibit obstruction to navigable waters as Congress has done

17

in the Rivers and Harbors Act if the public Is not entitled

IS.

to use those same waters.

It doesn't make much

We are confident that it must have

19

been the assumption of Congress In 1899 that the waters it

20

was directing the Secretary of War to keep free of obstruc­

21

tions were the same waters that the public had a right to

22
23
24
25

navigate.
QUESTION:

And the Corps of Engineers can require

that the slips be kept free of obstacles, can't they?
MS. OBERLY:

Yes, they can.

39
QUESTION:

1

2

And then doesn't It follow that the

putlie can get in the slips?
MS. OBERLY:

3

No, we are willing to concede that the

4

public right is subject to reasonable regulations.

5

would be that the Cor-ps of Engineers9 permit to the slip

6

owner to build implies a right of exclusive use of the slip

7

and: mooring area there.

S

eral public, it runs to the person who built the pier mid for

9

it to be a meaningful permit he has to be able to find his

10

13

14:
15

16

The permit does not run to the gen­

parking space open when he gets there.
Another thing would be the Corps could set regula­

11
12

tions under the authority of section 1 of Title 33 that would
put those slips off limits to the public in order to foster
navigation in the open channel.

What is being taken is

the? use of all of the tremendous amount of improvements that
have been made totalling over $6 or $7 million, and likewise
if the government should prevail, if there is a public navi­
gation servitude imposed on these waters, who is going to
pay for the maintenance of this pond from now on?

The

channels will silt, the walls will deteriorate, debris will
accumulate in the pond, security will be impaired.

Can you

require private lessees to continue to pay for a public pond?

I don’t think that is fair, Your Honors.

The Corps of Engineers — it is a. matter of record,
