ORAL ARGUMENT OF SILAS J. WASSERSTROM, ESQ*-,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, IfASSE RSTR0M:

Mr, Chief. Justice - and may it plaas©

Idle Courts
My name is Silas Wasserstrom and I represent the

Petitioner Thomas Whalen0
Petitioner was tried, in the District of Columbia
Superior Court on a seven-count indictment chargine rape ,
:• '
.
robbery, burglary end three counts of felony murder predicated
/V

'1’

f

y

■on these feloniesa

He was ale© charged with one count of

siecand degree murder, that is murder with malic®,
'

_

‘

■

v

All of these charges grew out of a single incident
.
•
f
and involved one victim,

'H

Two of these counts ~~ robbery and felony murdery*

premised on it — were dismissed fey the trial court,,
QUESTION:

You put a great deal of emphasis on

the fact -'hat there is only one victim?
MR. WASSERSTROM:

Well, I just want to make clear,, Your

Honorp that the issue'here is one that involves consecutive safc.tenoar
where where there is a single victim.

Certainly if there had

been more than one victim, our position would be very

4
I am not trying to argue the fact that it was one
victim is dispositive.

It is clear to the Court that it is

a case involving a single victim,,
v

Two more of these counts, those charging burglar!/
and felony

murder burglary f were dismissed by the Court of

Appeals for reasons not —
QUESTION:

You say one victim, and therefore for
f

only one crime.
MR, WASSERSTROM:
Honor.

That is not our position. Your

Qur position is that if the murder in this case is

proven by the Government in a way that does not depend cn
proof of the underlying felony, then we would not claim that
there was any double jeopardy violation in punishing
consecutively for the felony and for the murder.

And we said

in our brief that we are not challenging on double jeopardy
grounds consecutive sentences for rape and the second degree
murder count here,

Qur position is not that

simply because

there is one victim there can only be one sentence,

Our

position turns on the fact that here to prove the felony
murder the Government relied on the underlying felony,
QUESTION:

Is that strange?

MR. WASSERSTROM:
QUESTION:

No, it is not strange at all.

It doesn’t seem so to me.

MR. WASSERSTROM:

No, it isn’t strange at all.

would be strange, in. our position, would be to punish the

What

5
person consecutively, however, for the felony murder as well
as for the underlying felony,
QUESTIOH:

What is strange about that?

MR, HASSERSTROM:

Well, it is strange for a number

of reasons.
First, the felony murder statute in the District
of Columbia-and most felony murder statutes do, is to impose
a rule of strict liability with respect to murder occurring
in the course of a felony.

The District of Columbia statute,

for example, makes the penalty for such a murder — first
degree murder ~ it makes the murder first degree murder and
it makes the penalty for that murder 20 years to life, mandatory
sentence 20 years to life.

And that can be for killing which

is otherwise blameless, the killing was just unforeseen,
unforeseeable, unintended,
QUESTION:

Because of the legislative judgment
i
/
that -- necessary only if a felony were so dangerous to society,
that if life is taken in the course of commi, s si on of a felony,
you should be treated just as if you had the intent to murder,
MR, WASSERS.TROMs

Well, Congress might have wanted

to do that, but it is obvious that Congress didn't want to
do -that here.

That is a separata argument.

This is an

argument we made, that Congress didn't intend consecutive
sentences in this case? and we made that argument based on
the legislative history and the structure in felony murder

6

statuteso
The double jeopardy argument is e. different one.
It is -that to prove felony murder, a murder which carries 20
years to life, whereas the underlying felony without a killing
would carry n© mandatory sentence and would be punishable by
provision if the judge chose to impose it*

Our argument of

double jeopardy is that when a felony murder can only bo
proved by proof of the underlying offense, that is -the felony,
then the felony is a lesser included offense of the felony
murder»
QUESTION:

But -that that just stands Blockburger on

its head, doesn't it?
MR» MASSERSTROH:
QUESTION:

Well, that’s —

Because Blockburger wasn't originally

a constitutional test, it was a test for determining legislative
intent»
MR» WASSERSTROM:
argument, Your Honor»

Well, that is the Government’s

But there is really no question but

that this Court has since Blockburger adopted it as the
constitutional test for —
QUESTION:

In what case?

MR» MASSERSTROM:
the Court said:

Well, Brown v» Ohio, for example,

"The established test for determining whether

two offenses are sufficiently distinguishable to permit the

7
imposition of cumulative punishment was stated in Blockburger.*
QUESTION:

Well, that doesn't say anything about

double jeopardy, does it, ~-:MR. WASSERSTROM:
QUESTION:

Well —

the quote you just made?

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Well, what else would preclude

it?
QUESTION:

Brown v. Ohio was a double jeopardy case,

was it not?
MR. WASSERSTROM:
QUESTION:

It was a double jeopardy case? yes0

But the quote you just made

said nothing

;about double jeopardy.
MR. WASSERSTROM:

Well, double jeopardy was the only

constitutional provision that could conceivably forbid
consecutive —
QUESTION:

Further consecutive sentences.

MR. WASSERSTROM:
clear in stating that:

Moreover, in Brown this Court was

"When the greater offense" —* when

two offenses are related to a greater and lesser included
offense they are "the same for purposes of double jeopardy.55
Here we submit the rape underlying the Petitioner's conviction
for first degree felony murder is a lesser .included offense
of the murder for the simple and compelling reason that to
prove its case of first degree felony murder, the Government
necessarily had to prove -the underlying rape.

This being so,

8

Brown» Blockburger teach that the rape and the felony predicated
on it are the same for double jeopardy purposes,

tod thus»

the consecutive sentences imposed here were unconstitutional,
QUESTION:

You say Brown» Blockburger,

I take it

what you mean is Brown, since Blockburger wasn't a constitutional
case,
HR. WASSERSTROM:
Honor, is this:

No, Block — our position. Your

that Blockburger establishes a test.

QUESTION:

For legislative intent,,

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Well, it establishes a test which

was originally formulated as a test for determining legislative
intent.

It has since been adopted by this Court as the

f

constitutional test for defining same offense.
QUESTION:

In Brown.

MR. WASSER5TRQM:

Although

Brown has bean treated — it has

been treated as a constitutional test in several other
cases.
QUESTION:

Yes, but Brown was a State case where

presumably the State courts of Ohio were perfectly competent
to determine what the intent of the Ohio legislature was.
MR. WA8SERSTR0M:

Well, that is ail the more reason

it would seem then,the fact that this Court never’ struck down
the decision of that court.
QUESTION:

So it didn*t turn on legislative intent.

MR. NASSERSTROM:

Well, it turned on the fact that

&
the Ohio court interpreted its two statutes — the two
statutes it issued there ~~ joyriding and grand grand larceny
as bearing a greater and lesser included offense relationship»
That was determinative to this Court in Brown* the fact that
one was a lesser included offense than the other* and this
i

Court held that they were the same for purposes of double
jeopardy,,
QUESTION s

Suppose a man and his wife were talcing a

walk* or a young man and his girl friend* and the attacker
rapes the woman and then ’.murders the man in the process of his
trying to come to her defense and her aid»
MR„ WA5SERSTR0M:

Double jeopardy?

If they had consecutive punishments

for the — if the Government can prove any kind of intent with
respect to the murder and prove the murder based on that
theory —
QUESTION:

A felony murder and he committed a homicide

in the course of carrying out a felony —• committing a felony»

would be more difficult problem»

There is 2 would concede

that, that’s double jeopardy»

10

MR® WASSERSTROM:

Well, I think it would be do

QUESTION:

Under what case would be?

MR® WASSERSTRQM:

It would be wonder the same

principle, Your Honor, Brown v. Ohio and Bloekburger as row
incorporated as the constitutional test®
The murder in that hypothetical you postulate, apart
from the felony —
QUESTION;

Suppose he went on to murder -die woman

too, then, chose to eliminate the only surviving witness?
MR, WASSERSTROM:
QUESTION:

Well, I think that in most —

Is it still double jeopardy?

MR® WASSERSTROM:

Well again Your Honor, in most

situations, such as the case here, the murder can be proved
on a theory other than that of felony murder®
QUESTION:

I am. just assuming -—

MR, WASSERSTROM:

And where it can be proven on that

theory®
QUESTION:

The hypothesis is that both are felony

homicidas and therefore under the statute, felony murders?
MR, WASSERSTRGM:

Well, certainly if he eliminated —•

if he killed the woman to eliminate her as the only witness
it would surely be a premediated murder and if the State were
able to prove it as such and, if it did, then double jeopardy
might not —

1C “A

QUESTION;

Yes, but you can’t try him for double

jeopardy *—• you can’t try him over in some other lawsuit -—
the Chief Justice suggests --what if it is tried as felony
murder and the only proof it is of intent is mother felony*
is it the underlying felonyc
MR® V7A3SE RS TROM:

If the Government proceeds on the

felony murder statute as to each of the two?
QUESTION:

-Yes .

MR® WASSEESTROM;

Then each felony murder would be

punishable consecutively, but -not consecutively to the underlying felony®
QUESTION:

So your theory does say that evep if

there are» two victims it would be double jeopardy?
MR, WASSEESTROM:

It would be double jeopardy to

punish consecutively for the rape and the felony murder, not
to punish consecutively for too felony murders®
QUESTION:

Than certainly that doctrine if it were

followed by this Court would put a premium on eliminating the
witness,
MR® WASSERSTROM:

Well, in D„C« for examplef Your

Honorr if you eliminated two witnesses your penalty for two
counts of felony murder would be 40 years to life, which means
that you would be eligible for parole after 40 years,

I

don’t think that, facing that kind of penalty, that is going
to induce criminals to want to murder wantonly without thinking

They wore called, to

their attention in the supplemental filing we mad® and
called it to their attention in a petition for a rehearing ®n

baste..

So. the court was aware of them when it issued this

decisio:.!»
It seams to us# Your Honors* that both the Court
of Appeals and the Government speak of the felony surder rule
as one which permits the jury to infer the requisite intent

13

of first degree »urct@r from th© cosaaission of the underlyin'
felony- and in this respect tfa©y fail to ua&arctand the
fundamental natura of that doctrine.
In th® District of Columbia that felony murder
statute does not saarely create a permissive presumption that
the accused harbored a particular mental state with respect
to 'the killing,

the jury is not instructed that it may infer

that the defendant had th® mental state required for first
degree premeditated murder from the fact that the killing
occurred in th© course of a felony.
QOBSKOMs

We are talking nos? about th© intent of

Congress in passing this Act?

MR, NASSSRSTH0M:

8?©,- I • am just talking right »o»

Your Honor about th© way the felony murder statute in fast
operates.

Th© Government and th© Court of Appeals both treat

it as tirough it simply creates a presumption and that the
jury then makes it® own d© t© smi a ©tion of whether there was in
fact pre-meditation' and deliberation.

Court of Appeals construction of the statute-,

otherwise be, or

should hav® been an apparant double jeopardy problem»
QUESTION;

But you ©re not quarreling with the

Court ©f Appeals construction ©£ the statutos»
MS. WASSERSYKOM:

Well, we are quarreling with their

constructio of the statute m intended to permit consecutive
punishments here, or too authorise —
QUESTION: ’ But sine© the Court Reorganisation Act oil
1970, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is the
last word as t© what a statuto® such as this means, ©3 if a
State court says this is what it means„
' MR* WASSERSTRpM:

Well, Your Honor, w® would submit

that although the District ©f Columbia may since Court
F©organisation bear certain of the hallmarks of a State' and
State court decisions may not be viewable in the way they
were prior to Court Reorganisation, where there is a
constitutional gu©x*antee at stake **« and w© submit that even
cur legislative argument is grounded in the Constitution
the ^ Govemsianfc itself concedes that where multiple punishment;
is imposed and the legislature did not intend it foe imposed
there is a violation, a substantive violation of the accused®s
double jeopardy rights*,
QUESTION:

Do you suppose Congress had in mind the

thought that it was bad ©rough to have the crime of rape occur

but they didn't want 'to do anything to encourage homicide, the

killing of fh® victim, and that therefor® two penalties war»

provided?
MR* HMSEISTMJMj

Wall, Your Honor, there Is a

penalty for rap® and there is © penalty for felony murder*
It is our position that Congress did not in fact provide: in
any sense that these punishments be impos able- consecutive ly e
In fact our position is that the legislative history and
the structure of these statutes indicates if anything that
Congress did not intend to permit the courts to cumulate;
punishments for felony murder and the underlying felony»
I don't think there is any question that tbs felony
harder statist®,is on® of the interests that is protected by
that statute is the"interest in saving human life*

But it

does so in a way and is structured in suds a way, that It scers
apparent another interest to be• protected in..'that rule

in

that statute Is the same interest that is protected by the
underlying felony»

Congress didn't after ail make it first

degree murder to kill undor any circumstances in any way®
It didn't iisposs a rule of strict liability for any killing,,
end."Impose a mandatory sentence of 20 years to life»

It is

only if the killing occurs in the course of the felony that
such a penalty is authorised*
It is our position that that indicates vary strongly
that what Congress meant to do by the felony murder statute
was to punish the person, hold him culpable both for

billing and for committing the underlying felony daring which
the killing occurred.
lha Government to a gra&t extent X think gats mileage
out of tha facts of this case*

This case appears clearly to

•involve a rape and a murder — or killing» rather* which was
in fact done with

And the jury so

calpabl® ®®ntal state*,

found, the jury found him guilty of second degree murder.

i

QOBSSXfflSi

What would haw been the penalty if there

had been just a «order* just the homicide md nothing ©Is©?
MR» HASSE!STBON}

Just the socond degree?

The

penalty would be op to IS years to life but# againf unlike
first degree surder a judge can give any sentence he wants
it

,

■■

■'

in 'tti© District of Columbia, including probation for second
degree-Murder®

That is the startling thing,,

Perhaps' not

just in the District of Columbia;? although Y, think it aaf hm
more extrema here.

And that is the startling thing about

felohy «order statutes*
«order*

They sake «order first degree

They make a killing,, ratherf first degree murder.

In tha District of Columbia at least, that killing carrias

& mandatory penalty of 20 years to life.

Mo matter what

the judge wants to do the defendant conwicfc€.«d ©f first dagree
surder is going t© spend 20 years of his life in jail.
Any other for® of homicidec second degree, manslaughterf
the judge can give a sentence of probation.

That is truts

also with’ respect to any of the underlying felonies can b©

1?

tli© predicate for felony reorder,.
It n&orm ale©- that the structure of the statute»
repeals that Congress intended to punish in part for the
felony, because th© statute imposes a rule of strict liability
j

where the killing occurs in th® course of sis enumerated serious
faXosiie© and requires that for it to b® first degree murder,
a felony, as any other felony the murder has to be purposeful.
This in our vim? also indicates that Congress when it enacted
th® 'penalty provisions

when it enacted th® felony aurder

statute and structured it the way it did **- clearly intended
that the punishsmnt for th® felony murder would incorporate
th® notion of liability for th© underlying felony as well.
This is why in our position if a court punishes A defendant
consecutively for a felony murder end for the felony on which
it is promised, in a very real and palpable sense it is
imposing double punishment for that felony.
QiJESTZOMs

Well., do you think that argument withstands
...

«*$*■'

analysis; *i'n th® castf'of intentional rap® that results in death
where there is carnal violation of’ -th© woman plus th© death’?
aren’t there two separata interests there?
. ESH* WASSERSTROM:

Nell, I think thisr© are two

separat® interests but — >ay position is that the interest
protected by the felony murder statute is an interest in human
life plus an interest protected by whatever the underlying
#».

felony charge is.

IS

QUESTION*

W®1If, say in tfe© •***

ME» tihSSEBSTROMs
both those interests.

Whan you punish, you are protesting

Wh« you punish for rap®, you are

punishing tid.ce for the rap©.,
QUESTIONs

X simply «ion * t follow you»

Perhaps I as;

wrong and you are right on the analytical aspect of the thing
but it seems to no that — you know.,. you casi^cenoaiv© of a
i
system ©£ justice which regarded penetration of a woman in a
■

/

rape case as being a more serious offense than the taking of
life,
■ MR, W&SSEBSTROMs

this Court did hold however

that, for example, the death penalty would ha inappropriate

for rap©,
QUESTIONj

Righto

But I am saying in an analytical

sons© you cam have your seal© ©f values however the legislature
chooses .to drm that»
MR. WASSEE5TRQK:

Well, Your Honor, for example it

certainly does *•— It does punish rap© more severely than it
doss manslaughter»
QUESTIONS

Yes,

But again, I think the Court should be ©a mind
that the felony murder statute doesn’t work only where there
is a rap©»

It works with any one of six' enumerated felonies

to impose ;a rule of absolutely strict liability®

That is

a parson who burns down a. house hs believes feo be vacant but

19

in the course of th© fire a derlict who happens to fee sleeping
in it is .killed# is punishable by a mandatory sentence of 2'.
years to life*

Mow# that sentence obviously has to be based

not only on the fact that a killing occurred# because that
killing was unforeseen and unintended# but on the fact that
it was during the course of an arson.
' .

QUESTION:

Is the double jeopardy analysis that you

think the Court has adopted based on the actual facts necessary
for a conviction in ©aeh particular crime# or in the abstract

on what facts might b© used to convict for each particular
orissa?
MR. WASSSRSYRO&t
easy question.

Wall, I don't think that is as

I think th© position *»- what test this Court,

has adopted —
QUESTIONt

Well, I don't either.

MR. WA5SEESTRDM:

Wall, the position that I think

the Court has adopted and the position which we take in our
brief is that at the very least when the indictment itself
reveal® that on© offense is a lesser included offense titan
the other# it will have to 3b© proved in order to prove the
other# then it should be treated as* a lesser included offense,
and the same offense# for purposes of the double jeopardy
clause.
QUESTIONS

So

MR* NASSERSTROMs

That it seems to me -«*

20

QUESTIONS

Is that an answer to the question of

whether if for double jeopardy purposes you analyze the facts
of sadi particular case to dacid© whether there is double
jeopardy and if one fact has to be proved twice or on© offensa
contains a fact that -the other does, it is double jeopardy?
Or is it an abstract ‘thing that you might have to in a
hypothetical situation prove one fact twice?
MRo WASSERSTRQMt

Again, Your Honor, if you look

at the indictment in this case, for example. you can Bm. by
looking at the indictment that to prow the felony murder the
Government is going to have to prove the felony **- I mean the
rap©,, to prove that raps was premised on a felony murder, they
dr® going to have to pxrov© the rape»
Host, again, in many casos a murder that is part in
so®e sense of a felony or that occurs during a felony, it may
very wall be provable as a murder, as a homicide on some
theory other than felony murderc

And where the Government

does that it is not relying on the felony —QUESTIONS

But -that isn't this can®»

ME. WASSERSTROSfs

No., the defendant here was

convicted of second degree murder»
QUESTIONS

So as far as first degree murder is

cwicemd, this case involves felony murder and felony murder
only*

Am I right?
MR* WASSBRSTROMs

That is correct, Your Honor»

QUESTIONi

And if foe w©re to gat a new trial h©

MR* WASSERSTROM:

MR» HASSERSTROMs
first degree murder.

But here h© wasn’t charged with

He was only charged with second degree

murder and h© was convicted of second degree murder»
Of course we are not challenging 'the conviction»
All we are asking for is remand for re-sentencing with respect
to the rape and the felony murder premised on it»
He stands convicted right now of second degree
murder, incidentally.
QUESTION:

That conviction was never set aside.,
Ha was convicted of second degree

murder*
MR„ WASSESSTROM:
The Court of Appeals made

He was and he stands convicted»
&

point of not setting that —- I

don’t know if it mad© a point, but it didn’t set aside that
conviction,,

It vacated the sentence on that count»

Our

double jeopardy argunsent would not preclude a court on
remand from sentencing consecutively for rape and for second
i

degree murder.

So the defendant still would be, in our view,

subject to a penalty of up t© 30 years to life.

This would

22

be because the second degree murder was proved without reference

2 think that even offenses that have always been traditionally
considered almost paradigmatic eases of a greater offense
■anci a lesser included offense would in their view be differant,
not be the mams for double jeopardy purposes.
Also,, as we argue in our brief, it seems to me that
the decisions of this Court, or a plurality opinion of this
Ce*rfe in Jeff@r3 as

as the dissenting ©pinion in Jeffers,

o&ch indicate that in deciding whether two offenses ~~

QUESTldHs

D© you think Zannelli fits that analysis?

HR» WASSERSTROMs

Well, 1 think that Jeffers and

Xannelli read together certainly do.

The way Jeffers talked

about Zannelli and the way Jeffers emphasized «•- I think it
was Footnotes 15 and 16 of Zannelli «— 1. think th© court was

./'

I have very little time left»

2 would" just say

that I think our briof adequately cowers our argument that
©win if the double jeopardy clause doesn' t apply her® t©
absolutely bar consecutive punishments, that is even if the
/

Government* s position is accepted, any kind of reasonable
interpretation ©f th© relevant statutes would have led the
Court of Appeals'to conclude that Congress did not here
intend consecutive punishments»

Th® legislative history of

the penalty provisions to th© felony murder statute which
war© enacted in 1962 show quite clearly -that those members
of Congress who addressed themselves to this question felt
that for a fatal felony murder the defendant's effective,
sentence should not b© greater than the sentence for pro-

meditated first' degree murder, that is 2© years to life,
m the Sovarnssenf1^ view, every time a felony murder is
proved the defendant would be subject to a penalty considerably
longer than that 20 years to life sentence which the congress-*
won thought was sufficient,
QOSSTIOHs

And you spell that out of the legislative

history, do youf of the —
nR* HhSSBRSTHOM:.. All the congressman that spoke to
-he iseue indicated that they thought 20 years in prison for
th® single felony mksrder was ©sough time to be eligible for
parole.

It doesn't man that he is going to be paroled, but

ifc Mans h® would b® eligible after 2© years.
It is also, we argue, implicit in the structure of
the statute.

But more importantly, it is our argument that

it double jeopardy doesn't operate to bar absolutely punishment;
tor two offenses that are th® same,under Blodcburger, at the
v&rf least it creates a very strong constitutionally-based
preauts^tion that where two offenses are the same, under
‘3-lockburger, consecutive punishment should not be iiaposad
'ualass the legislative intent that' they bs imposed is
unmistakably clear*

ORAL ARGOMENT OF ANDREW L, FRB¥„ ESQ® *
ON BRHJ&F OF SHE RESPONDENT

HR* FREY*

Mr 4 Chief Justice * and may it pl©®5?a the

Courts
Fro® one standpoint this appears to be a case that
deals with an arcane mid esoteric corner of the law»

It; lend»

itself to subtle linguistic disputes regarding the Meaning of
such terms as "same offense8 and "lesser included offense" as
wall a® to elaborate efforts to plumb the depths of the
Mysterious Slockburger test®

Xfe has produced from Petitioner

and intricate analysis, of snippets of dictum in Brown v9
Ohio, in Jeffers, and in S lisps on*
ited X can * t deny that w® too ham* engaged in our
brief in a serious effort to analyse' comprehensively this
complex and interesting talk®
■ ^her® is however a danger in all of this

the

Court will lose sight of th© forast for the trees®

So let m® draw back for a minute to make ©as® point®
It seems to sea both futile and absolutely devastating f©
Petitioner*© contention that the double jeopardy clause bars
Congress 'from imposing cumulative punishments for rape and
felony murder because the two offenses are the same»
Congress had enacted a statute that stated es follows s

Suppose
-'’Anyone

28

who kills another person in the course

of

committing a rapae

shall be sentenced to a maximum term of life imprisonment and
to a minimum term in the discretion of the sentencing court
of not less than 20 nor more than 35 years »*’
How* it s©@.ass to ms bsyond argument* given the
power ©£ th® legislature to define offenses and to set punish*»
ments for them, that the double jeopardy clause would have no
bearing whatsoever on th© validity of such a statute*

had

that is exactly what th© Court ©£ Appeals construed the statute
in this case to mean,»
How* it is tru® Congress expressed its will by means
of two separata statutes * which must be read together to give
the result of my hypothetical statute, but surely th® double
jeopardy clause cannot bo construed to require that th®
legislature: employ a particular form of words or that it do
something in on© section rather than two.

Such a reading would

triviali re this important constitutional pre-vision»

Thia is

precisely th© conclusion that this Court reached in Gore
where' it said about* after analyzing the hypothetical statute
such as X have given* is it conceivable that such a statute
would not be within the power of Congress»

And is ife rational

to find such a statute constitutional but tc strike that on
the E1 ockburger doctrine as violative of the: double; jeopardy
clause or her® to strike down th® two separat® statutes as
violative ©£ the double jeopardy clause?

29

let m® tom back from the fexeat to th® trees.
Petitioner68 argument rests upon th® notion that because proof
of felony murder requires th© proof of th® underlying felony*
the latter is a lesser included offense of the felony murder
and therefore is the same offense and therefore may not b©
made the subject of multiple punishments.->

He says th®

Blockburger test is a constitutional test under the double
jeopardy clause for th© permissibility of multiple punishment»«
There are several difficulties with his argument.
The first difficulty is -chat rape and felony smrdar
are not in fact th® same offense under the Blockburger test?
which depends upon the elements of the two offensas»
Obviously, on© need not kill la order to rape ©r rap® in orier
to kill»
QUESTION*

Under th© Blockburger teat th©r© didn't

have to be successive prosecutions for these two offensos*
MR» FRET;

I don't think that th© Blockburger test

is the exclusive criterion for successive prosecutions f although
S think that if they fail th© Blockburger fast there could not
be successive prosecutione»
QUESTIONs

Well, do you think there could he

successive prosecutions here?
MR. FREYs

Well, not under H«arris

Oklahoma? but

X hav© no problem squaring that result with the position that
w© are contending for here, because it is a very different
