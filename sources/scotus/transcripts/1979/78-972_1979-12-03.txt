Mr. Bryson?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRYSON;

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

The

issue in the case is the extent to which the Government can
make evidentiary use of immunized testimony in a prosecution
for perjury committed in the course of that testimony.
Respondent was called to testify before a Grand
Jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

He testified

— initially when he appeared before the Grand Jury, he
declined to testify, relying on his Fifth Amendment privi­
lege against compulsory self-incrimination.

The Government

then sotxghfc and obtained an immunity order under the Federal
immunity statute to compel his testimony.

And he then testi­

fied, and in the course of his testimony he made several
false statements that form the basis for the perjury charges
against him.
Now, after a jury trial, respondent was convicted
on two counts of perjury.

In the course of the trial, the

4
Government introduced not only the charged false statements
themselves, but also other portions of his immunized testi­
mony, to show that those false statements were in fact
false and that the falsehoods were made knowingly, and that
the inquiries and the responses were material to the Grand
Jury's inquiry.
On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed.

It

held that the only portions of respondent's Grand Jury
testimony that could permissibly be used against him, were
those portions that were specifically charged as false,
what the Court called the corpus delicti of the offense.
Now the Court defined the corpus delicti as follows;

to

include the false charged statements themselves, plus those
portions of his Grand Jury testimony that were absolutely
essential to convey the context within which the false
statements were made.

The Court held that the use of any

other portions of his Grand Jury testimony, even if rele­
vant and material to prove the charges against him, was
error.
QUESTION;

Mr. Bryson, you are assuming, I take

it, that perjury is prosecutable even after immunity —MR. BRYSON;
QUESTION;

Absolutely.
As a matter of — if the matter were

res nova, what would be the basis for that assumption?
MR. BRYSON;

Well, there are basically two ways

5
to approach the question, Hr. Justice Rehnquist.

One is to

say that, as a practical matter, if the Government grants
immunity to a witness and the immunity grant, which is
intended to confer a protection on the witness in exchange
for something useful to the Government -- if the immunity
grant does not insure to some extent at least that the
Government will get truthful testimony, that if it doesn't
give the Government some means of getting truthful testimony,
then the immunity grant is, in effect, no grant at all.

It

gives the Government nothing in exchange for the immunity
that is given to the witness.

So it is necessary as a

matter of the grant of immunity that the Government have
some right to protect itself against perjury in the course
of that immunised testimony.
The other approach is to say that, in fact, per­
jury is a crime which has not yet occurred at the time the
individual pleads his Fifth Amendment privilege.

It is not

a crime as to which he has a privilege at the time he
invokes his privilege, and therefore he gets no protection
under the grant of immunity.,
QUESTIONs

But if you take the language from

Kastigar and from Portash, that the grant of immunity must
be just as broad as the prixd-lege against self “incrimination,
it seems to me there is not a very — that is not very logi­
cal, if the matter were res nova, because if a man had

6
claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, the Govern­
ment never would have been able to ask him any questions, and
there never would have been any possibility of perjury.
MR. BRYSON;

Well,- except, Your Honor, that if he

had invoked his privilege — let's take an example;

Suppose

that an individual had committed a bank robbery, or was under
investigation for a bank robbery that had occurred 10 years
ago, and the statute of limitations had run.

He came before

the Grand Jury, and was questioned about the bank robbery
he invoked his privilege.

and

If he went before a Court, the

Court would say, "You can't claim your privilege with respect
to the

bank robbery.

that offense.

You have no privilege with respect to

Why are you claiming a privilege?"

He would say, "Because I may commit perjury in the
course of my testimony, and I don't want to be xsrosecuted
for it."

The Court would say, "You don't have a privilege

with respect to that," and therefore he would be compelled
♦to testify.
So the language in Kastigar that suggests that the
immunity must be as broad as the privilege is consistent
with our position here, which is that the —
QUESTION;

But .that assumes that the Government

isn't willing to force the Fifth Amendment issue right at
the time? that rather than tell the man, "We don't think you
have a Fifth Amendment privilege.

Go before the judge ancl

7
have him decide it," because of some cases decided by this
Court in the early ’50s.

It is just a much easier thing to

do, to give this man immunity and convict some of the higherups, rather than fight it out on the Fifth Amendment basis.
MR. BRYSON:

That is true, but the question is,

what is the scope of the immunity that he is granted, whether
or not the Government contests the scope or the propriety of
the claim of

-the immunity at the time it is granted.

Clearly, from this Court's cases, it is established
that the immunity doesn’t protect against, for example, uses
against the witness in civil proceedings, uses, specifically
here for perjury, to show the actual perjured statements.
does have its limits.

It

It doesn’t put the individual in the

same position that he would be in, if he had simply remained
silent.

The question is —
QUESTION:

Do I understand the center of your

argument is that the immunity can not give him protection
for a crime not yet committed?
MR. BRYSON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

the basic theoretical posture on which we proceed.

That is
If an

individual comes before a Court and says, "I may commit a
crime next week.

If I testify today, I may give evidence

that will be useful in prosecution of ms in connection with
that crime," then the privilege does not protect that indi-vidual against the future crime.

8

And an example of this would be, suppose the
individual were to come before a Grand Jury in an investi­
gation, say, of his possession of firearms, and he were to
say before the
next week."

Grand Jury, "I intend to kill the President

Well, it can't be, and I don’t think that this

Court under this Court’s decisions, or even as re3 nova,
could -- would hold that this individual uould have a privi­
lege not to testify because he believes that he could be
prosecuted for this future crime.

And by the same token he

does not have immunity with respect to any statements he
may make that are used in connection with a future offensa,
his prosecution for a future offense.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Bryson, I want to be sure, you

outlined two prongs to your argument a little while ago.
Do you rely on both of them or on -- if not, on which?
MR. BRYSON:

We think, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that
%

the theoretical basis for both really is found in the second
prong, but I think we can rely on both —
QUESTION:

There certainly is Court of Appeals

authority based on the first prong.
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

There is.

You cite the cases, but you don't rely

on the theory, as I read your brief.
MR. BRYSON:
theory, Your

Honor -

We don’t specifically rely on that

9

QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. BRYSON:

— because,, well, because we think

that the reason that perjury is really ~ the reason that
perjury is an offense a3 to — future perjury is an offense
as to which there is no privilege, is because it is a future
offense, not so much because it is perjury, although we do
rely on the general notion -- which I think is an important
notion, and it is one that has been recognised by this Court
before

* that the grant of immunity has no 'value if in fact

it confers with it an immunity from prosecution for perjury
which is committed in the course of that immunised testimony.
QUESTION:

Let me ask this one:

Suppose, during

the Grand Jury testimony after the grant of immunity, the
witness truthfully stated that he had committed perjury or
a prior occasion.

Does the grant of immunity prevent the

Government from prosecuting him for that perjury?
MR. BRYSON:

If he were granted immunity, that is

correct, he would have protection against the use of his
statements because he had —- he is testifying with respect to
a former crime, just as if he was testifying with respect to
a former bank robbery.

He would be protected.

In this case,

however, his claim would have to be that, he fears that he may
incriminate himself with respect to perjury that he may commit
before the Grand Jury.
QUESTION:

So that you are really relying on that

10

one prong,, and not on the other one.
HR, BRYSON:

Well, wa are relying on that as a

theoretical basis, but

I don’t want to abandon the very

important notion which underlies the first prong, which is
that the Government must be entitled in granting immunity,
to protection against perjury in the course of that immunity.
QUESTION:
minute
happens.

But the scenario which you outlined a

ago, seems to me to be the reverse of what usually
Your scenario indicates that first immunity is

granted, and then the witness testifies without anything
happening first.

As I understand it, what first happens is,

the witness says in response to a question from the prosecu­
tor, "I claim ray privilege against self-incrimination," and
the Government says, ”A11 right.

We will immunize you.”

Whereas it could have opted for the alternate course of
saying, "We challenge your claim for -— that an answer to
that testimony would incriminate you, and let’s go up
before the judge and have a hearing on contempt for failure
to answer the question.”
MR. BRYSON:

Well, ordinarily it is pretty clear

what the basis for the claim of privilege isi if the witness
is being called in to testify with respect to an investigation
of a bank robbery, and he takes the Fifth, it is pretty clear
that he fears incrimination with respect to the bank robbery
and possibly other related offenses, or related instances

il
that could lead to his incrimination.

But the Government#

it is our submission, does not have to go before the Court
and make sure that everyone understands that he can not
claim the privilege with respect to the risk of future per­
jury, because in our view that is the rule, that he can't
and that he should understand that, and that there is -QUESTIONS

Mr. Bryson, suppose on the first day of

the Grand Jury he answers a question a certain way, and then
the Government cross examines him, and the next day you show
him soma document and he finally says ~ well, he answers the
same question another way, and he says, "I have just lied
yesterday.

I thought I could get away, but I can't."

Now,

if the Government prosecuted him for perjury, your position
is, you could use both —■ the answers to both questions?
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct, unless he —
And that isn't any different than what

you are saying now.
MR. BRYSON:

That is correct, and unless he had

invoked — having made his initial false statement -QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:

MR. BRYSONi
QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:

Yes.
— unless ha invoked his privilege -But he didn't?
No.

If he did not, he could be ~

But your immunity wouldn't cover that -That is correct, because the false

12
statement, Use perjury there, would have occurred after -the
initial grant of immunity, and as of the time of the initial
grant of immunity, that statement would not have been protected
by the privilege.
Now I would like to say —
QUESTIGN:

Just, before you go on, maybe I am

wasting even more time, but am I incorrect in my assumption,
my understanding that this basic question isn't in issue in
this case?

Doesn't the respondent concede that-"
MR. BRYSON?
QUESTION:

Well —
-- there can be a prosecution for par-

jury —
MR. BRYSON:

The question of whether there can be

a prosecution for perjury is not in issue? the question is -—
QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:

That is what I thought.
— how much.
Well, then don't let me waste any more

of your time.
MR. BRYSON:

Well, that — there is no question,

as to the basic question of whether there is a prosecution.
But I would like to, in light of that issue, I would
like to point

out just why it is that it is so important that

this kind of evidence be admissible.

It may not seem so at

first blush, but in fact, in many perjury prosecutions this
is the best evidence, and

sometimes th-h- only evidence that

13

can be adduced to show that the statements were in fact per­
jurious .
How to take an example, many times perjury comes
not in the form of a flat false statement, that is to say,
that l!X” didn't happen, but rather that the witness will
simply say, "I don't recall," some event which, in the view
of the Government and what we believe the proof will show,
he clearly must recall.

The best way to prove that, and

again often the only way to prove that that is a falsa state­
ment, that he in fact does recall, is to show what he was
saying in the course of his Grand Jury testimony leading up
to that statement and after that statement.
For example, suppose the Grand Jury is investigating
a particular instance that occurred a year ago, and they ask
the witness a series of questions about that incident; and he
remembers what he was wearing on that day, what he had for
breakfast, who he was with, what the weather was like, and
then he is asked the critical question, "Did you give Mr. X
$10,000," and he says, "I don't recall."

Well, the fact that

he says at that point, "I don't recall," is, in context with
those other questions, highly incredible; but if you take
that statement out of context and simply have the one state­
ment admissible at trial, e,I don't recall," in response to
the question, "Did you, six months ago or a year ago, take
$10,000 from Mr. X,55 it is very hard to prove that is false,

.14

that in fact he does recall.
QUESTION:

So it is, in effect —

Could we go back for just a moment to

the two alternative bases for the Government's position, and
is it your view that testimony about future crimes is simply
not protected by the privilege against self-incrimination,
as a constitutional matter?
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:

Forget the statute.

That is correct, Your Honor.
The Grand Jury calls the witness in and

says, "We want to ask you about this bank robbery that you
are planning for next week" —
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
— and he claimed a privilege, you would

say he had no privilege.
MR. BRYSON:

Absolutely.

That is a risk which is,

as a general matter, too speculative and remote to entitled
to the protection or the privilege.
Now in the case that I put, if we bring a prosecu­
tion, of course, we can practically not prove that the
statement, "I don't recall" — which in fact was the statement
that was made

in this case, with respect to one of the counts

— we are practically disabled from proving that that was not
true, and in effect, this rule, for which respondent contends
and which the Third Circuit adopted, undercuts the whole
preraise of Glickstein, the Supreme Court's decision back in
1911, in which it held that when the Government grants immunity

15

it retains unfettered power to prosecute the witness if the
witness abuses the grant of immunity by lying under oath.
So in effects the Third Circuit and respondent
have argued for a partial immunity from perjury.
say, it

Now, as I

is our position that neither the Federal immunity

statute nor the Fifth Amendment prohibits the use of all
relevant portions of the witness!s Grand Jury testimony to
prove that he committed perjury under the grant of immunity.
And first I would like to discuss the Fifth Amend­
ment problem a bit.
point.

I would like to touch on the statutory

The Federal immunity statute, which both respondent

and Court Appeals, although briefly, rely on to support their
position, the Federal immunity statute provides that immunized
testimony can be used, and I quote, "in a prosecution for
perjury."

There is nothing in the language of the statute

or its legislation history that suggests that that broad
language was intended to have any narrower, more restrictive
meaning.

It does not say, "in a prosecution for perjury, but

only to the extent that the false statement constitutes the
corpus delicti of the offense," or i!only to the extent that
the immunized testimony is false."
It is a basic rule that where there is a prosecu­
tion under the grant of immunity, the immunity does not apply,
and the legislative history of this statute supports this.
The -- again and again, the legislative history reflects that

Congress intended the immunity statute to go to the consti­
tutional limits, which we, as we argue here, believe permit
any legitimate use of the immunized testimony.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, the statute clearly goes

beyond what was required by the Constitution under your
future offense theory, because he could not be prosecuted for
any future offense except perjury.
MR. BRYSON:

Isn't that true?

Well, Your Honor, we believe that the

statute is not — the three exceptions in the statute are not
the only exceptions to the use of immunized testimony, but
they are clearly-stated exceptions, so that those exceptions
do —
QUESTION:

Well, you rnoan to say the statute should

be read to say it doesn’t apply to these three exceptions, or
to anything else the Constitution v?ould tolerate?
MR. BRYSON:

It is our position, Your Honor, which

we argued in the Dunn case last year — that point is not
necessary, of course, to resolve this case — but in the Dunn
case that was argued last year, we argued, and we have made
the same argument, I think, in a footnote in our brief in
this case, that the constitutional limits is what Congress
held in mind; that Congress intended the immunity statute to
be read to include anything that the Constitution would per­
mit.
An example where i think that would be necessary.

17
as a construction, would be my example of a threat against
the President,

If the witness goes in under a grant of

immunity and makes a threat against the President inside
the Grand Jury, even though he is testifying under a grant
of immunity, we believe that the Federal immunity statute
would permit his px'osecufcicn for threatening the President,
And similarly, if he tried to bribe the grand jurists, to
fake an example, but it isn't necessary to reach that point
in this case because this is perjury.
The “-well, I see that my time is growing shore.
I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr. Slorasky?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL HARVEY SLOMSKY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SLOMSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
If I may just go back to the facts of this case,
to a certain extent, Mr. Apfelbaum was charged with two
counts of making false statements before the United States
Grand Jury.

Count one charged that he was not truthful when

he denied trying to attempting to locate an individual by
the name of Harry Brown in Florida in December of 1975.
Count two charged that Mr. Apfelbaum was not truthful when
he denied in the Grand Jury that he told two F.B.I. agents
that

who had interviewed him, that he had lent Mr. Brown

13
$10,000.

In addition to — these are the Grand — these are
the

statements made in the Grand Jury that constituted the

corpus delicti of the flase swearing offenses.

The Govern­

ment proved with extrinsic evidence, apart from the Grand
Jury testimony, what is probably the falsity of these two
Grand Jury statements.

Number one, they had six or seven

witnesses who — independent "witnesses, who showed that Mr.
Apfelbaum did in fact attempt to locate Mr. Brown in Florida
in December, 1955.

They were essentially school teachers,

and nonbiased, nontainted witnesses of good credibility.
With respect to the Count two, the two F.B.I.
agents testified, Agents Dennis and Perry, that on —• I
believe the date was March 16, 1976 — they appeared at the
District Attorney8s office in Philadelphia, introduced them­
selves to Mr. Apfelbaum, and he told them that — among other
things that they testified to — that Mr. Apfelbaum said he
lent Harry

Brown $10,000.
Now the Government, at the trial, introduced not

only this extrinsic evidence b'at they attempted to introduce
truthful, immunised testimony to prove, as they said, that —■
and argued to the jury that the truthful, immunized testimony
somehow, in some way, was relevant to the charges.
QUESTION:

MR. SLOMSKY:

— the prior testimony is no longer

truthful —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SLOMSKY:

— and that is the Dunn case, I

would agree that —
QUESTION:

Right.

Well, then, I know, but you <re

still using so-called "immunized” testimony to prove perjury
MR. SLOMSKY:
QUESTION:

But there is now —

Besides the corpus delicti, -the false

testimony is on day one, but on day two he says something
that -- and on this occasion, he says that that was false.
So you are using a —■ some immunized testimony to prove that
he testified on day one falsely.
MR. SLOMSKY:

The distinction I am drawing is this

20

that the immunized testimony you are using on day one is now
concededly false immunized testimony
QUESTION:

Yes* but how do you prove that?

MR, SLOMSKY:

The Government will prove it with the

second appearance of the witness before the Grand Jury.
QUESTION:

So you are using it by other testimony

before the same Grand Jury?
MR. SLOMSKY:

Assuirdnq that the second testimony

before the Grand Jury is truthful* but there i~ now an
acknowledgement that the first testimony is false.
QUESTION:

I know* but you are still using his

acknowledgement before the Grand Jury.
MR. SLOMSKY:

Well* I understand that.

In contrast

to that case, in this case -QUESTION:

Well, would you say that would be proper?

MR. SLOMSKY:

That the — I would agree it is pro­

per only because there is now in the record an acknowledge­
ment of false immunized testimony.
QUESTION:

Yes, but — so you would say the

Government could use his testimony on day two to prove that
his testimony or* day one was false?
MR. SLOMSKY:
QUESTION:

Well, my answer is, yes.

At least if it is in form of an

acknowledgement of falsity?
MR. SLOMSKY:

That is right.

Now, in contrast ro

21
the -QUESTION:

That doesn’t really lead to a very

principled distinction, does it, once we get to the use of
immunized testimony to prove perjury?
MR. SLOMSKY:

Well, I agree with that.

My claim

here is, number one, there was absolutely no concession that
Mr. Apfelbaum's immunized Grand Jury testimony was false, in
contrast to the situation that was just raised.

We don't

concede for one minute that what Mr. Apfeibaum was required
to do under the grant of immunity, and the compulsion which
was — he didn’t want to do it, against his will — and that
is, he was required to testify truthfully in the Grand Jury.
Now, when he did that, it apaears that he exposed
himself to having his truthful immunized testimony used
against him in the perjury prosecution.

In other cases, in

the Hockenberry case in the Third Circuit, there was a pro­
secution for perjury given during the course of immunized
testimony.

The defendant took the witness stand and testi­

fied, and the Court held that even in the prosecution for
perjiary, the incriminatincr truth could not be used against
the defendant in the criminal — in the perjury prosecution.
The same thing is the rule in the Second Circuit.
Hockenberry was a Third Circuit case.
QUESTION:

Eut how do — all of those lead to very

ad hoc distinctions, don’t they?

Once you concede that you

22
can be prosecuted for perjury on the basis of immunized
testimony, and yet you say that you have limits such as the
Third Circuit imposed, you are going to have a — very much
of a case-by-case analysis as to how much of the immunised
testimony you can use, and that sort of thing»
MR. SLOMSKY:

Well, that is a distinct possibility.

The only way to overcome it is for the Court to announce a
rule which would protect the incriminating truth, but still
permit the Government to prosecute a person who -- for perjury
who perjures himself during the course of his testimony.
1 might say that .
QUESTION:
question to you.

Let me go back to Justice White's

This is hypothetical.

testifies to some facts.

On day one, he

On day two, he does not admit that

those previous statements were false, but the Government
introduces a sworn statement of his that is just to the con­
trary.

Now that is extrinsic evidence, not out of his own

mouth at the time.

What would you say about that?

MR. SLOMSKY:
QUESTION:

I would -- in other words —

And then he is later prosecuted for

perjury before the Grand Jury.
MR. SLOMSKY:
QUESTION:

Is —

Would you say the immunity protects him?

MR. SLOMSKY:

Is Your Honor saying that apart from

the two appearances before the Grand Jury, there is a sworn

23
statement in which he is admitting that his testimony was
false, on the outside?
QUESTION;

Not admitting it, it is just totally

contrary, just totally contrary, showing that his testimony
on day one was false by the piece of paper which the Govern­
ment introduces on day two, which shows that it was false»
MR» SLGMSKY s ' My position-isr under those-.circum­
stances, that the

there could be -- that the truthful

admissions made in the Grand Jury on one of the two occasions,
that is, there being two apparent inconsistencies, could not
be used against the witness for a prosecution for perjury,
because in fact the Government would be using against him,
truthful immunised testimony, and there would be nothing in
the record other than the inconsistencies, to show the
false statements»
QUESTION;

Well, haven't we said in several opinions

that a grant of immunity does not confer a privilege to lie?
Isn’t that almost verbatim out of one of our opinions?
MR» SLGMSKY:

That is correct, and I have absolutely

no problem with that concept»
prosecute him for perjury»

I am saying, if a witness lies,

Prosecute him for false swearing»

That is not what I am arguing here today, that no possible
prosecution for those things could occur.
My argument is that, in the course of the testimony,
when the witness gives truthful incriminating admissions and

24
those admissions -- which are compelled admissions,- he is
giving them involuntarily — when those admissions are later
used against him in the perjury prosecution, then there is a
definite violation of the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

You have altered my hypothesis.

My

hypothesis is that they are untruthful statements to the
Grand Jury- which is demonstrated by extrinsic evidence.
MR. SLOMSKYs

Well, the Courts of Appeals have

held that under the inconsistent declaration provision of
18 TT.S.C. 1623, that a prosecution could not lie under that
situation.

The only exception that I know of, and that has

been the uniform holding of the Court of Appealsf the only
exception I know of in that regard is the Dunn case, and
that is only because the defendant admitted that he testified
"falsely on a different occasion.
I might say that the —- in New Jersey v. Portash,
which was decided by this Court last March — the defendant
in that case, who agreeably was not charged with perjury, took
the witness stand, or would have taken the witness stand and
testified to events A.

His legislatively-immunized Grand

Jury testimony was absolutely inconsistent with his testimony
that would have been given, had he testified at the trial for
his misconduct.
This Court held that the legislatively-immunized
Grand Jury testimony could not be used, even though it was

25
inconsistent, could not be used against him? and I believe
ic was a 7-2 opinion, and even the dissents in the opinion
did not disagree with the majority.

It was basically a

jurisdictional argument on dissent.
QUESTION;

What case were you referring to, now?

MR. SLOMSKY;

The Portash v. New Jersey, that the

inconsistent, immunised testimony could not be used against
Mr. Portash in that prosecution.

There you have concededly

false —
QUESTION;

That was not a perjury prosecution.

MR. SLOMSKY;

It was not a perjury prosecution.

Now, I might say that in the Traiaunti case, in
the Second Circuit, there was a perjury prosecution.

In that

case the defendant did testify and conceded that his immunized
his prior immunized testimony was false.

The Court said

that under that circumstance, the rule in the Second Circuit
is that the defendant could be impeached with false immunized
testimony, because the false testimony has absolutely no
constitutional protection.
There

are instances where — as I have indicated,

where the Courts have uniformly excluded the use of truthful
immunized testimony in the perjury prosecution.

There is no

case that I know of, in which the —
QUESTION:

What is the reason for that?

MR. SLOMSKY:

The reason is that the immunity grant

26
must be coextensive with the Fifth Amendment privilege it
displaces.

But for the grant of immunity, the Government

wouldn't have possession of the truthful immunized testimony
to use against the defendant.
QUESTION:

But for the grant of immunity, the.

Government never would have been able to ask the defendant
any question, and there never would have been any possibility
of perjury.
MR. SLGMSKY:

Well, I agree with that.

Really, the

issue comes down to, is when the Government has extrinsic
evidence of perjury against a defendant who testifies repeat­
edly in front of the Grand Jury, but does the defendant in
being compelled to testify, forfeit all his Fifth Amendment
rights with respect to his truthful testimony?
In this case, Mr. Apfelbaum was subpoenaed before
the Grand Jury after being granted immunity, on two occasions,
Decesnber 13, 1976, and January 3, 1977.

In effect, the

Government, the second time he appeared, had the transcript
of his prior immunized testimony.

In effect, they went over

a second time what he testified to on the first occasion
before the Grand Jury.

They could have subpoenaed him a

third time, and a fourth time, and now they are arguing that
testimony

that is contemporaneously given, even if truthful,

could be used against the defendant for — in a prosecution
for perjury.

27

Doesn’t this expose the defendant to claims of
perjury in different, noneontemporaneous Grand Jury pro­
ceedings, based upon different aspects of the Government's
investigation.

I can foresee a perjury indictment contain­

ing six different appearances before the Grand Jury, and the
Government claiming that the six are unrelated but all the
truthful testimony given during each session of the Grand
Jury has forfeited its Fifth Amendment privilege, because
he lied in one or two respects, and therefore we can use
against you in the perjury prosecution the balance of the
immunised — truthful immunized testimony, only because it
relates to the particular perjury given during the Grand
J'ary .
It could result in a very heinous situation, when
in fact the defendant is in a situation where, on an involun
tary basis, he is being forced to testify.

Coneededly, in

part, ha is doing the very thing that the immunity grant
forces him to do, and that is to testify truthfully.
QUESTION:

The —

Well, you wouldn't contend, I suppose,

that if in the Grand Jury room he picked up a chair and hit
the prosecutor over the head, that he was immune from prosecution for that act on the ground that but for the grant
of immunity he wo.uldn't even have been there, would you?
Would you make that kind of an argument?
MR. SLOMSKY:

I wouldn't make that argument, but

28
with respect to the Government’s example of, in the Grand
Jury, a threat against the President, isn't that a present
crime being committed during the course of the immunized
Grand Jury testimony?
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t perjury before the Grand

Jury a present crime committed before the Grand Jury?
MR. SLOMSKY:

Well, that is the reason why the

future — the claim of the Government that future Grand Jury
testimony — that the immunity grant doesn’t protect future
crimes or future perjury, must fail, because the defendant
is committing a present crime and the statute is permitting
the prosecution for perjury.
This might be a hypertechnical distinction, but
the statute only says that the immunized testimony may be
used — it gives an exception.

My argument really is the absence

of that minute word ”in" doesn't really mean that the Govern­
ment has the wholesale right, because

to use the immunized

Grand Jury testimony that is truthful.
The statute really, concededly, is unclear in
covering the issue that I raised in the Third Circuit, where
I won before its unanimous three-judge panel, or the issue
raised by the Government here.

MR. SLOMSKY:

I am not asking the Court to hold

that Mr. Apfelhaum could not be prosecuted for perjury.

What

I am asking the Court to do, is to restrict the use that the
Government could make of truthful immunized testimony,
because the oath itself requires him to tell the truth.
immunity grant requires him to tell the truth.

The

He has bean

instructed by the District Court under 18 U.S.C. 6002 that
he must tell the truth in the Grand Jury, and now, once he
tells the truth in certain parts, the Government is turning
around and saying, "We are going to use the truth against, you
as substantive evidence in our case in chief, to prove the
perjury."

QUESTION:

ted you could do it for any other wit-

MR* SLOMSKY:

You could do it for any other witness?

MR* SLOMSKY:

Assuming the —

You could do it for any other witness;

do you agree on that?
MR. SLOMSKY:

Mr. Justice Marshall* when you say

you can do it with any other witness* I must adrait I am un­
clear in what respect Your Honor means that.
QUESTION:

Well, you said that they used the truth­

ful statements of his, and that is what you were complaining
about.
MR. SLOMSKY:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Well, could they use the truthful state­

ments of a witness that didn’t have immunity?
MR. SLOMSKY:

Yes, sir.

That is a vastly different

situation from a person who is involuntarily in the Grand
Jury, forced to testify —

x am

not claiming that, if there was no immunity grant here, that
the truthful immunized testimony could not be used against
him.

If a person goes into a Grand Jury voluntarily, and

testifies, so be it.

The Government is in a very enviable

situation in that regard, but here there is a vast difference,
is the grant of immunity which the witness didn't want in the
first place.

In fact, Mr. Apfelbaum did six days for con­

tempt of court before he agreed to testify in the Grand Jury,
and thereafter when he went into the Grand Jury, the incrimi­
nating truth on a later occasion was used against him.
Kastigar is very broad in saying that the truth —
immunized testimony — I think really this and the Dunn case
is the first time where this Court has faced the issue of
truthful versus false — the use of tx*uthful versus falsa
compelled testimony, but Kastigar said that the immunized
testimony can not be used in any respect save the exceptions
in the statute, and I would agree that it could be used in a
variety of civil matters as the Courts have so held, but
that is not this situation, and the new —

The universe is all criminal cases, with

just drawing the distinction because the prosecution for per­
jury is a criminal case like any other criminal case, and
when a defendant finds himself in a situation where the
incriminating truth is being used against him, and the Govern­
ment wouldn't have the evidence but for -che grant of immunity,
the statute really doesn't say the extent to which the truth­
ful immunized testimony can be used.
My argument is that it can't be used at all against
a defendant in these prosecutions.

Certainly it couldn't be

used in the Porfcash case, if —

But that wasn't —

MR. SLOMSKY:

It couldn't be used in the Portash

here it can't be used in the Government's case in chief also.

QUESTION:

Well, what about — go back to my

example, as I was mooting with you, testimony: day one,
testimony A, day two, testimony B, and they are flatly in
conflict., and the second time he says, "I lied the first
time.”

Now, do you say that testimony B can't be used?
MR* SLOMSKY:

Testimony B —

On the second day, and it is flatly

inconsistent with testimony A on the first day.

He says, "Yes."

’"Well, which one is

And he says, "The one today."
MR. SLOMSKY:

So in other words, he is conceding

that the one on the first occasion is false?
QUESTION:

Right.

Now, may you use the answer,

the answer to the question on the second day?
MR. SLOMSKY:
QUESTION:

only because —

Well, yes, you say

MR. SLOMSKY:
QUESTION:

The

My answer is "yes," but only because —

Well, then you do say —

MR. SLOMSKY:

— only because of that concession.

QUESTION:

then you do say that you may use some

truthful testimony?

34
MR. SLOMSKY:

If the Court has before it evidence

of falsity on the prior occasion, then that can be used, but
QUESTION:

Well, they — you do.

You do.

He says

that he -- he testifies flatly to the contrary, and says
that "I am speaking truthfully today."
MR. SLOMSKY:

Well, Justice White, I take that

position because I think it is the correct position, and
because I know that it was the position taken in the Dunn,
case.

If a person admits his perjury, why should he

escape the -—
QUESTION:

But you can use not only his admission,

but his contrary answer?
MR. SLOMSKY:

Well, the contrary -— the admission

— the contrary answer would be the corpus delicti of the
offense, but that

is concededly false, and the Government

has to prove it is false, and there is a concession of
falsity there.
QUESTION:

Well, but you could use his answer, his

contrary answer on the second day, which was true -—
MR. SLOMSKY:

I am --

"Were you there?”

"Were you there," and

he says, "Yes, I was there," on the second day.
"No, I wasn't there," o:a the first day.

MR. SLOMSKY:

He had said,

And the prosecutor

And he says, "Yes."

Again, that is a concession I am

35

making, but that

is a vastly different factual situation

from the case here.

In the case here, number one, the.re is

no concession that the testimony was truthful.

Number two,

there is absolutely no inconsistency between the testimony
that is contained as the corpus delicti of the offense and
the balance of the truthful testimony.
QUESTION2

What if on the first day he said — he

was asked, "Were you there?" — and he says, "Yes."
day he is asked, "Were you there?"

On the

And he says, "No."

Can

the Government use both of those statements in the prosecution?
MR. SLOMSKY:
QUESTION:

I would answer that the answer is -’no'8.

Why not?

MR. SLOMSKY:

Because there is no evidence or no

concession from the witness of falsity.

That is a decision

that will have to be made by a jury on a later occasion.
That is the very situation in the inconsistent declarations
situation, that the Courts have said is tantamount to a viola­
tion of the Fifth Amendment, because you are using against
the witness truthful immunized testimony.
I draw the very — the only distinction I make
between that situation and Justice White, is that there is
a concession by the witness that he lied.
QUESTION:

But that is just -a "but for" test

which would exclude a perjury prosecution.
MR. SLOMSKY:

Well, I — it has been the holding

36

of the Court of Appeals in the Dunn case, that there could
be a perjury prosecution under that circumstance.

I don't

consider it to be an exception to what I am advocating here,
which is that truthful immunized testimony could never be
used against a defendant.
The Court of Appeals, in the Court below, was
quite clear in the Frumento case, that was an en banc Court,
that truthful immunized testimony could not be used even in
the —- even when there is an inconsistency.

The — Justice

White's example is an unusual one, in that there is a con­
cession of falsity.

If there was no concession of falsity,

I would say that the truthful immunized testimony could not
foe used, but in any event, that is the 18 U.S.C. 1623 situ­
ation.

It is vastly different, I would say, from the situ­

ation in which Mr. Apfelbaum found himself, in which testimony
that wasn't inconsistent with the two claimed instances of
flasity in the indictment charged against him, was being used
against him to prove that he lied.
QUESTION:

He didn't —

But then you are in a really ad hoc

area, when you start arguing about, was it inconsistent or
was it not inconsistent.
MR. SLOMSKY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That may not be an argument against you

or your suggestion, but it is going to mean a very difficult
development in perjured reports —

37
MR. SLOMSKY:

Yes, sir.

I consider the inconsis­

tent declaration situation to be a very novel exception
that really has to be decided as — more or less as an
exception to the general rule* if that kind of prosecution
is going to be permitted.
In my situation, it could happen far more fre­
quently than that one, where a witness during the course of
his Grand Jury testimony which is immunized, finds himself
giving truthful admissions of prior wrongdoing, and finding
that the Government now is permitted to use those truthful
admissions of wrongdoing against him in a perjury prosecu­
tion.

That is a much broader, and I think a much more heinous

situation than the situation involving the inconsistent
declarations.
The only other fact I would like to say is that,
as the Second Circuit and the Third Circuit and even the
other Circuits have recognized, the Court should be vigorous
to permit a perjury prosecution when a person lies, but also
equally vigorous in protecting the other interest here which
is so vital, and that is, protecting the incriminating truth.
I would submit to the Court that one doesn't forfeit his
Fifth Amendment rights that are set forth in the Constitution
when he is granted immunity, and that if the incriminating
truth is permitted to be used against him, then it would be
a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
