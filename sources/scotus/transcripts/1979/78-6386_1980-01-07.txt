PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

WE will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 78-6386, Rummel v. Estelle, the
Director of Texas Department of Corrections.
Mr» Atlas, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT J. ATLAS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ATLAS:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

My name is Scott. Atlas, court appointed counsel

for the petitioner, William James Rummel.
The only issue before this Court is whether the
*

Texas habitual offender statute, which since 1856 has
mandated an automatic life sentence upon third felony con­
viction, is cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth
Amendment to the United States Constitution as applied to
the three offenses for which my client received his life
sentence»
The facts are simply stated:

In 1964, at the

age of 21, Rummel pleaded guilty to buying four tires at
a gas station, worth $80, with a credit card that wasn’t
his.

In 1969a he pleaded guilty to forging a $28.36 cheek

to pay rent at a hotel.

And in 1972, he accepted a $120.75

check and promised to fix an air-conditioner, didn’t do it
and in 1973 a jury convicted him in essence of not intending
to c'o it when he accepted the check.

4
In the state trial court, after the conviction,
the jury found that he had committed the two prior felonies
and the judge assessed him the automatic life sentence
required under Texas law,
QUESTION:

Is there any question, Mr. Atlas,

about the validity of the any of the three convictions?
MR. ATLAS:
question.

No, Your Honor, there is no such

There is a Sixth Amendment question on ineffective

counsel that is not before this Court, but it has not been
decided and is still languishing in the
QUESTION:

So for present purposes —»

MR. ATLAS:

For present purposes, this is the

only issue before the Court, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

If these were three bank robbery con­

victions, would you be here?
MR. ATLAS:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor. I would not be here.
So you are casting your entire case on

the nature of the offense which the State of Texas through,
its legislature has declared to be a felony?
MR. ATLAS:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Each of

the three offenses were felonies at the time they were
committed.

The third felony, the $120 check offense became

a misdemeanor eight months later, punishable by a maximum
of only one year.

But at the time it was committed — in

fact, 31 think that is also true with the first offense, the

5
credit card offense —-■ at the time each of the three of­
fenses were committed, they were felonies under Texas law
and there is no question whatsoever that the statute was
properly applied according to the dictates of the statute.
QUESTION:

I take it, too, that — well, I will

put it to you as a question.

Suppose in each of these

cases you had exactly the same amount involved, that it was
the theft of a welfare check going to a welfare recipient,
what would be your position?
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, that is clearly the most

difficult analytical problem in this case, and my answer
is not a perfect one.

I think I would still be here argu­

ing in this Court that the harm to the victims, since it is
normally irrelevant at the sentencing stage unless it forms
part of the substantive offense, is also irrelevant

at

the conviction stage that it ought not to be a factor for
this Court.

Nonetheless, I realize that that created by

far the most difficult analytical problem, but I think
that since stealing the $200 or whatever the amount would
be from a welfare victim presumably constitutes the same
offense under Texas law, regardless of the identity of
the victim, we would argue that the offenses would make no
difference in this Court’s analaysis.
QUESTION:

And if these were street robberies, at

the point of a gun, in exactly the same amounts, what would

6
be your position?
MRo ATLAS:

Your Honor, my position would be very

different and I would not be before this Court»
argued in our briefs

We have

and we contend to this Court that if

there was any element of violence or potential violence in
any one of the three offenses, that this Court ought not to
consider the issue because the State of Texas is entitled
to pass judgment of a life sentence, even automatic, on anyone convicted of an offense that involves a violent offense
such as the bank robberies or street robberies that you
mentioned, regardless of whether any money was taken
successfully or not.
QUESTION:

Where :Ln the Constitution or cases

of this Court do you find the distinction between money
taken by violence or crimes committed accompanied by
violence and perhaps very significant -white collar fraud
that didn't involve a bit of violence?
MR. ATLAS:
point a bit.

Your Honor, first let me clarify my

When I say that if the offenses, any one of

them are violent, that that ought to mean the case should
not be In this Court, I do not mean that those are the
only circumstances under which the Court ought not to con­
sider an Eighth Amendment claim given a mandatory life
sentence.

There are certain offenses I think in addition

to violent offenses — for example, drug crimes, and certain

7
other crimes where the state has a peculiarly strong in­
terest — nonetheless, in direct answer to your question*
there is nothing specifically written in the Constitution.
We would argue that the Eighth Amendment ought to apply
to a lengthy sentence under certain circumstances and in
attempting to develop some type of objective criteria we
have relied on the Court*s decisions and the rules pre­
scribed in various death penalty and non-death penalty
cases* in particular the Court's 1977 Coker decision which
talked about the disproportionate nature of offenses to
the punishment given* and we would argue that in looking
at the nature of the offenses that any time an offense
involves violence or some element of violence or threat
of violence* that since those kinds of offenses are always
punished much more seriously in every state in this country,
then the kind of nonviolent petty property crimes with
which this Court is dealing in this case, that that ought
to be some indication, although not the final answer, in
and of itself that the sentence is excessive0
QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:

How about embezzlement?
Embezzlement again gives me somewhat

more trouble than the normal petty check offense.
QUESTION:

Why should it, you just drew the line,

and embezzlement certainly falls on the nonviolent side.
MR. ATLAS:

Yes, Your Honor, but, Mr. Justice White,

8
embezzlement eases we think generally probably have much
more of an indication of professional criminality, and we
would argue that if we are dealing with professional
criminals., someone who forges three $100,000 checks —
QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:

How about tax evasion?
Tax evasion, I think Ai Capone is

perhaps a perfect example.

The first time Al Capone v?as

caught, they threw away the key.
QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:

What about three times?
Three times, absolutely if you could

ever find someone.

QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:

Abso1utely what?
Absolutely the Court ought not to

consider an Eighth Amendment claim under those circum­
stances o
QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:

Why, it is completely nonviolent?
Yes, Your Honor, but it represents

an interest in which the state has a peculiarly strong
interest in preserving the integrity of the tax process
and we feel it is probably entitled to receive special
treatment by the court.
Judge Clark in the Fifth Circuit panel, and
again in his dissenting opinion in the court in this ease
*

made it clear that not only when the offenses involved
violence but also when fchei’e wa3 a strong social interest

in -QUESTION:

Well, what about just a compulsive con

man who just goes around conning people out of money, with
false schemes, especially children and old ladies, there
are a lot of those around, you know?
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, if we were dealing with

a statute that mandated a life sentence uon conviction of
a sufficient number of offenses to entitle -QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:

Let's just talce three.
Yes., Your Honor, I think the state

under those circumstances would not be entitled to make the
irrebuttable presumption that someone is a lifetime con man
and deem him beyond redemption, justifying the mandatory
life sentence subject only to the parole board’s unfettered
discretion.
QUESTION:

Then it turns on the number in effect,

if it were seven rather than three, the case should come
out differently?
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, I think if the statute

mandated life after seven, I would have a very difficult
problem arguing the state’s conclusion
QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:
ing question here.
ought to be drawn.

What about four?
By far the most difficult line draw­
I can:t tell this Court where the line

10

QUESTION:

Well, you are though*

MR. ATLAS:

I can only tell this Court that wher­

ever that line is drawn, it ought not to be at three.
QUESTION:

But there is no question that the line

is drawn in your case?
MR. ATLAS:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

In fact,

there is no question that there is no statute in this
country at this time in which someone receives an automatic
life sentence upon conviction of any more than four felonies.
There are 30 states only where one receives an automatic
life sentence for four, and there is only one state now as
a practical matter, as I have discussed in my brief, I
have distinguished Washington and West Virginia, because
of court decisions or court language in those states»

Texas

is the only state now as a practical matter where one would
receive an automatic life sentence for these three felonies,
and we would argue that since one of the criteria outlined
by this Court in the 1977 Coker ease and then mentioned at
various times by other members of this Court in. other de­
cisions, is looking at not only the nature of the offenses
but the trend in other states and the manner- in which other
states punish the same offenses, but since vre have been
able to trace out for this Court every habitual offender
statute ever enacted in this country in the last 200 years,
and since it is clear that a number of other states, perhaps

11
17 I believe have attempted to punish prisoners with an
automatic life sentence upon a certain number of nonviolent
felony convictions, and every one of those states, one
after another over the course of the years has decided
that either the statute didn't work or it was unfair and
now Texas stands alone by itself.
QUESTION:

Isn't that up to the state to do?

MR* ATLAS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

In the —

Maybe Texas will come around to that

point of view.
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, 123 years is long enough

for Texas to come around to that point of view.
QUESTION:
other states.
States.

But they have the examples in the

You’ve compared Texas now to the other

How do you compare the good time provisions in

Texas with those in other states?
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, the Attorney General's

office has provided us with charts that according to the
Attorney General’s office suggest that Texas is more liberal
in its good time credit.

That in. and of itself first of

all nought not to be considered by this Court since it is
a matter of discretion, but even if the Court considers
I

good time credit alone, that is not enough to affect Rummel's
i

sentence one bit.

All that does, for someoneiwho is given
i

a life sentence, is move up the time when parole becomes a

12
possibility.

It does not affect at all the time at which

my client would be entitled to release because in fact at
no time during his life is he ever entitled as a matter of
right, either statutory or constitutional, to any consider”
ation whatsoever In terms of release.

If he had a ten-year

sentence, then good time credit could move up the time
where he would have the absolute right to release.

The

maximum possible good time credit in Texas might allow him
to be released in five years, rather than ten, because he
could receive an extra day for every day he served under
the most liberal of the good time credit provisions.

But

where someone receives a life sentence under Texas law,
the time for release is never, and parole in Texas is some­
thing, as this Court has held In the Greenholtz case last
term, is something completely within the discretion of the
state.

As I have Indicated in the reply brief, the

Governor of Texas recently has been taking a much more
strict interpretation of the parole provisions and in fact
in June of this year rejected 79 percent of the parole
board's recommendations.
The state has argued that the life sentence here
is not really a life sentence because the parole board —
because Mr. Hummel might get good time credit and move up
the time when he is eligible for parole consideration, be­
cause then the parole board might then choose to recommend

13
parols to the Governor, and that the Governor might then
decide to exercise his prerogative to grant the parole.
These are conditions under which Mr. Hummel has absolutely
no right and ought not to be considered by this Court be­
cause if Mr, Hummel does not receive his hearing here today
he will never receive it, this Court will never review his
parole determination, if it is denied forever.
QUESTION:

Do you mean this Court or any other

reviewing court should not take Judicial notice of the tiny,
tiny percentage of life sentences that are in fact served
as life sentences?
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, the Cou3^t is entitled to

take judicial notice of that matter, but in terms of the
weight that the Court ought to give that, we think the
weight ought to be practically nil because there is no
right to it.

If the state 'would guarantee me today that

Mr. Hummel would absolutely as a matter of right get out
on a certain day, then I would not be in this Court, but
the state won’t do that, the statute doesn’t provide it,
the parole board won’t promise it, and —
QUESTION:

I take it then that you are just

suggesting we disregard the Fifth Circuit’s judgment as
to what the likelihood is?
MR. ATLAS:
the Court

Your Honor, I would not suggest that

14
QUESTION:

Well* the Fifth Circuit knows more

about local law and practice than we do and decided that
the chances were so high that he would get out that we
should take it into consideration, and you think if it
were 100 percent chance we should.
MR® ATLAS:

No, Your Honor.

If it were 100 per­

cent chance because it were a matter of right, absolutely,
but —
QUESTION:
MR® ATLAS:

Exactly, but now •—
and I have no difficulty with the

Court —QUESTION:

— you keep emphasizing the discretion.

The Fifth Circuit says that whatever, however it reads on
the books, the practice is that it isn't, whatever the
discretion is, it is a very narrow realm of discretion®
MR. ATLAS:

Mo, Your Honor, it is not true that

it is a very narrow realm of discretion®
QUESTION:

Well, the way it operates, it almost

always operates in favor of the prisoner.
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, if a governor comes into

office who chooses to cut back drastically on the number
of paroles granted among those recommended by the parole
board, then even though the parole board is exercising what
you have characterized, Mr. Justice White, as very narrow
discretion, the

governor and the parole board itself, if

15
It changes its mind or the members change composition is
entitled to exercise complete unlimited discretion.
Moreover, if Mr, Rommel misbehaves in prison or
demonstrates a surly attitude, the parole board will never
parole.

The factors upon which the parole board bases its

decision are only remotely related to any Eighth Amendment
considerations. and in many instances, as outlined in the
state’s brief and in its supplement, are factors totally
outside the control of the prisoner himself.
QUESTION:

Mr. Atlas, there are some states, if

I am not mistaken, California is one, where the sentence
after conviction for almost any felony is an indeterminate
sentence, and how long the convict

will actually serve

is in the discretion of — I think in California it is
called the adult authority, but the parole board.
MR. ATLAS:

Yes, Your Honor, but there is an

absolute -—
QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:

There are maxima, I suppose.
Yes, Your Honor, there are maximum,

and at some point the prisoner is entitled to absolute
release.
QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:

Well, is that true in every state?
Yes, Your Honor, we have demonstrated

in charts, the 204 pages — my apologies for the

length -—

that we submitted to this Court, that in every state except

16
the three I mentioned, plus Texas9 the discretion, either
the Judge or jury has discretion in sentencing with an
absolute boundary behond which they cannot go.
QUESTION:
judge or jury.

Nos no, I’m not talking about the

QUESTION:

After he is incarcertated —

board or, as is called in California, the adult authority
is very great, is it not?
MR. ATLAS:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, in every

state there la a certain amount of discretion for a certain
amount of time, but at some point the prisoner is entitled
to absolute release when the offenses are the same type of
offenses with which we are dealing in this case.

When

they are dealing with violent offenses, there may not be an
absolute maximum at all, and the prisoner may have no rights
to release at any time before the end of his term.

QUESTION:

How much does the amount have to do

with it?
MR„ ATLAS:

The amount has to do with it only to

the extent that it demonstrates that xve are dealing with
the pettiest type of offender, not an organised criminal,
not a member of any organized gang.

These are three petty,

small, double-digit check offenses, suggesting bad judgment

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Atlas, isn't the state

18
entitled to impose a much severer penalty even though the
facts are exactly as you state, because its judgment is
that after three of these type of offenses the person is
one who is simply unable to conform his conduct to social
norms in a way — the basic rationale for a recidivist
statute.
MR. ATLAS:
lutely right.

Mr» Justice Rehnquist, that is abso­

On the one hand, we do not argue that the

state is not entitled to increase the punishment based on
the existence of prior offenses.
is too much for too little.

We are simply saying this

On the other hand, if the

statute mandated a life sentence upon third or fourth or
fifth parking ticket, we have no doubt that the Court
would find that statute grossly excessive, that punishment
grossly excessive considering the nature of the offenses.
Well, having established the principle at some
point, we are now really attempting to determine where the
line ought to be drawn, not whether, because under some
circumstances if the state legislature is entitled to
characterize something as criminal and entitled to punish
the third offense, the third commission of that offense
with a life sentence, then a parking offense which states
typically characterise as criminal, whether felony or
misdemeanor, would Justify a life sentence under that
rationale upon the third commission of it, and there is no

19
question that someone who committed a third parking ticket
or a third speeding ticket or in Texas the third time you
steal a goat, with an automatic life sentence, at some
point this Court will be called in to say that the legisla­
ture has exceeded constitutional hounds»

And we would argue

that in attempting to provide some type of objective cri­
teria for this Court to decide the case and attempting to
suggest some ways to limit the inherent subjectivity that
is involved in most constitutional decisions and even most
peculiarly in an Eighth Amendment decision, that the criteria
that have been outlined by the Court and that we have
attempted to demonstrate we fulfill, and frankly whatever
test this Court chooses to adopt for evaluating sentence
length, we think Mr. Hummel's case makes it.
QUESTION:

Now, you have referred in the brief

and to some extent in your argument to the death penalty
cases, where the proportionality concept was introduced.

Is

it rot true that in all the discussion of proportionality
in the death case opinions, this is linked with the irrevers­
ibility of the punishment, and is it not true that the whole
concept of parole and probation is to make adjustments after
the judgment and after the sentence?
MR. ATLAS:
absolutely right.

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, you are

But if the state should mandate a life

sentence for one parking ticket and yet held out the

20

possibility of parole in 15 minutes, we have no doubt that
the Court would find that sentence excessive* no question
of —
QUESTION:

You are dealing with one parking

ticket or three parking tickets here, are we?

MR. ATLAS:

Even three parking tickets. Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

We are not dealing with them in this

ease.
MR. ATLAS:
QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:

No, Your Honor, absolutely not.
So we haven't taken that step.
No, but theoretically they could

under the rationale that the state has suggested.

No

question, death is different, although in the Hutto case
last term this Court mentioned the proportionality analysis
in the context of a non-death ca.se and it has in a number
of instances.
QUESTION:

The Williams ease had to do with

proportionality, didn't it?
MR. ATLAS:

Yes, Your Honor, it did and that was

a non-death case, a falsification of government documents,
although there was no proof of — and the statute did not
require proof of any fraud.

And. we concede for purposes

of argument that Williams Is different.

But there is no

question but that death is different and we don't question

21
that.

And perhaps the test ought to be imposed with greater

exactitude in the instance of the death penalty9 but that
is a different question»

The test itself ought to be the

same.
I will reserve time.

Mr» Becker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS M. BECKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BECKER:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I am Douglas Becker, Assistant Attorney General

of the State of Texas, attorney for the State of Texas in
this habeas corpus matter.
Your Honors, the State of Texas is of the opinion
that the fundamental issue in this ease is one of federalism,
a question of -*- questions of federalism have often appeared
before the Court in years past, but we feel that rarely has
a case ever cried out for judicial restraint and the appli­
cation of a doctrine that is attractive at first glance to
some because of the seeming oppressive nature of Mr. Rummel's
sentence in light of his convictions, but which would have
effects upon the administration of justice in Texas and
indeed throughout the nation, that would make the costs of
such a system far outweigh any supposed benefits.
Now, we feel that in the first place the holding
contended for by Mr. Rummel in this case would be a

22

usurpation of traditional prosecutorial discretion in
authority that has prevailed in this country and indeed in
England and which prevails today in virtually ail the
states.

The prosecutors in Texas who are locally elected,

as is often the case across this nation, it had always been
thought had the right to rely upon the judgment of their
own state legislature insofar as a societal judgment in
that particular society in Texas as opposed to any other
state as to which crimes were more serious than other
crimes, as to which crimes should be punished more severely
than other crimes, as to whether certain offenses which
were also offenses in Pennsylvania and. Rhode Island should
be pubished more

or less severely in Texas in light of

unique Texas experience, and that in the context of this
case insofar as habitual offenders are concerned, those
who are unable to conform their conduct to the norms of
civilized society, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist phrased it a
moment ago, the manner in t*/hich those persons should be
punished and as to what attempts at rehabilitation should
be made for those persons.
We thought that the District Attorney should rely
upon the judgment of the legislature, that he would in
exercising his discretion when he felt the statute should
be invoked, that he might do so, subject to the review of
the grand jury in Texas, and that such a sentence might be

23
imposed on someone.
Now, seen in this light, the application of the
statute is not automatic, as Mr. Hummel says it is.

In­

stead, the legislature gives the local prosecutor the dis­
cretion whether or not to apply or to seek the invocation
of that statute on a particular offender.

He commonly a.nd

frequently for many reasons elects not to apply
thought he might.

This is well known»

it even

And in such a case,

even then he must persuade the grand jury that this is a
proper case for the application of the baitual offender
statute.

Now —
QUESTION:

Mr. Becker, you could make exactly

the same argument about the Coker case, couldnTt you?
MR. BECKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Of course, the

Coker case, the key difference between the Coker case and
this one is the irrevocable nature of the punishment.

The

key difference Is that in this case we have a concept of
rehabilitation that Is possible»

We have an idea of re­

habilitation that cannot enter into the equation in Coker.
There Is no rehabilitation possible at all.

We feel that

makes a very large difference.
QUESTION:

General Becker, the Court of Appeals,

as I remember the opinion, started with the assumption that
the length of sentence could be sufficient to violate the
Eighth Amendment even in a non-death case.

Do you accept

24
that premise?
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —
So your distinction, of course, doesn?t

stand up.
MR. BECKER:

Well, of course, that is the most

difficult question I think that can be asked and I
QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:

I would be interested in your answer.
The concept of proportionality even

in death penalty cases, although it has never been applied
in a ease, in a criminal case to invalidate a sentence solely
because of its length, I can envision in my mind a state
legislature so

recklessly bent on some course of misconduct

and so totally unaware of principles established in modern
day civilized society that it

Blight

enact some statute so

utterly devoid of any rational justification that the
sentence

upon that statute could be excessive solely for

length alone and proportionality for that reason applied.
QUESTION:

On the other side of the coin, in death

cases is it appropriate for this Court to consider the
probability that the sentence will actually be inflicted?
As I think we probably all know, it is very rare for the
death penalty actually to be carried out.

Is that a factor

we should think about in death cases?
MR. BECKER:

Your Honor, I think not or certainly

it would bother me to think about that because once again

25
of the irrevocable nature.
QUESTION:

Even if we assume that in 90 percent

of the death cases either the governor will commute the sentence or It will be set a.side for one reason or another, we
should not take that into account in that context?
MR. BECKER:

Yes, sir, the problem is what happens

with the other 10 percent.
QUESTION:

Nov; —

What if this man is one of the 10 per­

cent who doesn’t get an early parole?
MR. BECKER:

All right.

Nov;, in the first place,

it is not a natter of being 10 percent, it is a much lower
percentage.

Now, what we have shown in the brief and what

the charts show is from the average length that a person in
his situation will serve, being approximately 12 years, and
furthermore we have shown in another chart that of those
eligible for parole by the third year of eligibility the
figure approaches 100 percent of those who were eligible
for parole.

By reference to other charts, it may be seen

that of that tiny percentage that is left, which may
possibly be as high as one or two percent, I believe, that
those persons are not persons such as Mr. Rummel, convicted
of less serious offenses than robbers, murderers and others
who become eligible for parole in certain circumstances in
Texas, and that that percentage must be reserved for those
persons so depraved that parole is not considered proper.

26
The statistics are so overwhelming in this case.
We believe that our proof is so convincing, the mathematical
proof, that it would be ignoring a very obvious reality to
say that Mr. Rummel indeed, although he has no legal expecta­
tion and no legal right, that the odds are so overwhelming
in his case that it is virtually impossible.
QUESTION:

General Becker, help me a little.

You

say practically none of the people ever serve their time.
Well, what is the sense of giving it?
MR. BECKER:

The sentence that we have given is

life, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the sense of sentencing

them to life if he is not going to serve life?
MR. BECKER:

Your Honor, the Texas approach to

this problem has been very different from that of some
other states and we thought that we were taking a more
modern approach.

Now, we could have a system of highly

determined sentencing in Texas, as some states do in some
circumstances.

In other words, we could have a system

where a man sentenced to ten years would serve ten years
or perhaps nine years with good behavior.

We haven't

chosen to do that system in Texas, particularly with one
like Mr. Rummel»

The system that Texas has chosen to act —

MR. BECKER:

What is so bad about Mr. Rummel?
What is bad about him is that he is

a habitual offenders none of his offenses singly have been
so serious, but a look at his criminal record, as the
prosecutor saw it, saw virtually that he is a career
criminal, that he committed one crime after the other, that
there was a succession of —

MR. BECKER:
four.

There is a total of four.
No, Your Honor, it is not a total of

It is a significantly higher number than four.
QUESTION:

Well, are you going to give him time

for the crimes he wasn't convicted of?
MR.BECKER:

Your Honor, we are giving him time

because of what he has shown himself to be.

He has shown

himself to be unable to exist outside of prison for any
significant period of time without violating the lav;.
QUESTION:

Why not sentence him to death while

you are at it?
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:

Well, Your Honor —
That would remove him.
Your Honor, it must be said that the

State of Texas is faced with a very- difficult problem here.

To an extent which Texas does0
Do you want to use the word "great”?

MR. BECKER:

As far as the rehabilitation and the

programs of the Texas Department of Corrections —
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

MR. BECKER:

— from my own knowledge, they are at

least as good as those elsewhere, we think they are.
QUESTION:

Can you get anybody else to join you

in that?
MR. BECKER:

I don’t know, Your Honor, but there

is a case in Houston, the Rouise ease, which is litigating
that very matter.

It is not directly involved in this case.

Mr. Rummel •— we have tried short of prison term with Mr.
Rummel — he is now serving his fourth term in the peniten­
tiary.

His first sentence, as the record reflects, v/ere

for three years.

He was paroled on that sentence, his

parole was revoked and he was sent back for a second time.
His sentence on his ?69 prior conviction was four years.
He c"id a portion of that time, he was released.

He violated

the lav/ again promptly and is novt in for his fourth time.
Now, we have tried terms of imprisonment for two

29
and three and four years several times.

It hasn't worked.

The scheme that Texas has chosen to enact now is one that
we think is not particularly oppressive.

What we have

said to him is, Mr, Rummel, all right, we have in shorter
terms of imprisonment have utterly failed to convince you
that following the law is the wiser course.
three times, we have failed three times.

We have tried

Nov; you are

threatened, with something that must give you pause to
reflect.

Nov; you are threatened with the possibility that

you will never be released for the rest of your natural
life.

Now, you know as well as we know that virtually no

one is kept in for the rest of his natural life, but think
about that possibility, think about it happening, and then
when you are paroled in approximately ten to twelve' years
from now, then perhaps that thought of losing the rest of
your life in prison will cause your conduct to change in a
manner that shorter terms of imprisonment have failed to do.
Now, perhaps that is not the wisest course of
conduct fcr Mr. Rummel.

Perhaps there is a wiser course.

Perhaps there is some course that would cause him to be a
model citizen without the agony to him of ten to twelve
years of imprisonment, without the expense to the State of
Texas, without all the things that are bade about the v;hoie
situation.

But the State of Texas doesn't know what it is.

And even if there is such a wiser course, the petitioner's

30
position here is not that what the State of Texas has done
is unwise, but that it is forbidden under the Constitution,
that it is so -—
QUESTION:

Mr, Becker, I got the impression from

reading both the dissenting opinion and the prevailing
opinion of the Court of Appeals en banc and from both you
and your opponent’s brief that you chose to make ’'real world"
arguments when it suited your purpose and kind of abandon
them 'when they didn't,
Mr. Rummel has been sentenced to a term of life,
has he not?
MR, BECKER:
QUESTION:

Yes,
And your argument Is in effect a real

world one that he doesn’t really stand to serve that if you
take the percentages into account,
MR. BECKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

I should emphasize

very briefly that with respect to the parole, in addition
to the twelve-year average for all persons doing life, a
good number actually are paroled at the absolute minimum
which is ten.

I talked to the Texas Department of Correc­

tions- on Friday and learned that on December 12th of this
yean- Mr, Rummel had already maintained trustee status which
meant that he was getting two for one time credit upon his
sentence.

As the Court knows, in Texas twenty years of
p

credit is necessary for parole, you can get up to — you

31
can

serve that in half the time or ten calendar years to

be eligible for parole.

He had already made trustee.

But

on December 12th his trustee status was made retroactive
to the very day he entered, meaning that he will be con­
sidered for- parole after nine and one-half years of time
behind bars —QUESTION:

And couldn't all of that have been re­

voked by now?
MR. BECKER:
tomorrow, yes.

Yes, sir, and it may all be revoked

The system in Texas is one that has a free

giving and taking of the good time.

That is the system.

Now, after he —
QUESTION:

Is it possible that the decision was

influenced by the pendency of this case?
MR„ BECKER:

No, Your Honor, it is not0

Now, after he is paroled also, Petitioner Rummel
characterises his situation as that of a perpetual prisoner.
Once again, viewing the case in reality, he is no such
thing.

What we have shown from the rules and regulations

of the Board of Pardons and Paroles and from the statistics
in our charts is that after three years of proper conduct
upon parole, he is placed on annual reporting status in
which he need only mail in once a year a statement which
gives his location and his job and — his residence and
his job essentially, and then after three years of successful

32
service upon that annual reporting status, he is shifted to
non-reporting status, which means that the only requirement
upon him is that he must not violate the law.

No longer

must he ask permission to marry, to change county residence
or anything of the sort, or even to stay in Texas.

He

simply vows that he will not violate the law and that if he
does he can be sent back to prison again, once again for
the rest of his natural life, but he is eligible for parole
in that situation from the first day that he returns to
prison.
QUESTION:

Can the resentencing in that situation

be for a misdemeanor?
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:
MR, BECKER:

Yes, sir, it can.

It can be —

How about a traffic violation?
Yes, sir, it can be for any violation

of the law, no matter how trivial.

Once again, the revoca­

tion is not automatic, it is discretionary, and if he is
sent back then he is eligible for parole immediately.
The system that Texas has adopted is one that when
we adopted it we had thought was for the protection of the
individual offender in the sense that he gained the benefits
of what we had thought was the modern train of thought that
the punishment should fit the offender.

We don’t ’want to

give every bank robber 25 years or 50 years or any particular
sentence because bank robbers differ in their experience and

33
in their motives and in their circumstances *

Mr. Rummel,

too, has been thrown into a very large pot with a very
disparate number and types of persons in it, those doing
life sentences.
We have shown in our brief and in the supplement
to our brief that his reasonable expectations of treatment
are far different from those of more serious offenders who
have received life sentences.
We would also point out that his situation is
very different in serving a life sentence than

that of a

person in many other states serving life sentences or even
long ones.

We have shown that because of the overwhelming

statistical proof as to how long he will actually serve
that his sentence is not significantly longer than that he
might have received in a number of other jurisdictions.
The differences at least are not so great in our view that
it can reasonably be held that the Eighth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States forbids it.
Again, Texas believes that no matter what criti­
cisms can be made of our scheme, that it is not the proper
function of the federal courts to be in the sentencing re­
view business.

The result contended for by the petitioner

would accomplish exactly that result.

Every prisoner in

state prison —
QUESTION:

Mr. Becker, on the question of getting

3^

into the sentence review business at all -- of course, I
agree with you, if you view the case as one of a ten or
twelve year

sentence, it is quite

different than if you

just view it in terms of the legal rights and the life­
time — what would your view be if you did not have this
kind of parole provision or if as a matter of law we
decided we would just have to look at the sentence cold
and not in the real world, as Justice Rehnquist puts it,
would you say it would be up to us to review a life sentence
without the possibility of parole for this kind of group
of offenses?
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:

Well, Your Honor, in our —
And get the federal court to —
In our particular case, we don't

feel that that would come up because the status as an
habitual offender we think is a different one.

But I think

in answer to your earlier question, I have stated I can
conceive some circumstances where proportionality would be
applied for —
QUESTION:

If you did apply proportionality, if

the sentence here were properly viewed as a life sentence
rather than one of ten or twleve years, would you agree that
that v/ould be excessive?

In this particular ease, Your Honor?
Yes.

MR. BECKER:

Absolutely not.

I would not, because

You don't really rely then on the —

you don't have to rely in your view on the probability of
parole as part of your defense statutory scheme?
MR. BECKER:

No, Your Honor.

I believe that we

should prevail upon the case regardless„
QUESTION:

There are basically two different

theories.
MR. BECKER:

Well, if — absolutely -— if the

man had been sentenced for stealing $230 worth of merchan­
dise on three different occasions, viewed In that way, that
would be one case.

That might even be close to the one

that you have been talking about, but that is not what he
was sentenced for.

He was sentenced because under Texas

law he is an habitual offender.
QUESTION:

That’s different and —-

Nonetheless, I take it you don’t

equate the term ’’punishment” as used in the Eighth Amendment
with the normal context of the word "sentence” independent
of parole possibilities?
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry. Your Honor, I don’t -Well, the Eighth Amendment forbids

cruel and unusual punishment, as we all know.

You are not

saying I take it — and I understood that Mr„ Atlas was not
saying either — that that means you look only to the

36
sentence and not at all to the possibilities of parole,
where you are dealing itfith a life or less sentence rather
than

death sentence with its irreversable aspect.
MR. BECKER:

We think that long sentences, even

very long sentences, if it is the expressed societal judg­
ment of the state for various crimes, that that is entitled
to the deference in federal court, and it might be that a
sentence could be so unusual and so bizarre and so unsup­
ported by logic that it could be possible that that would
fall within the punishment of cruel and unusual punishment
clause or the meaning of that word, but ordinarily that it
would not, and clearly this is such a case where it does
not.

It is

o.

ease — we feel that it is quite easy, as

Judge Thornberry said in the court below, and quite openly
I believe, that perhaps if he were the prosecutor he
wouldn’t have sought to obtain this indictment, if he were
a grand juror he wouldn't have approved it, if he were a
state legislator he would vote to repeal it, but he holds
none of those offices.
QUESTION:

He went on to say, as I remember it,

that as long as there is a rational basis for the sentencing
scheme, that passes the Eighth Amendment standard*

Do you

agree with that test?
MR. BECKER:
Your Honor.

Well, I do agree with that test,

I don’t think — I think that the purpose, the

37
underlying purpose of the statute — now, actually the —
you know, the petitioner makes the point that you can always
make a rational basis explanation for any punishment, even
death for a minor offense as a rational basis in the sense
that it will prevent recurrence of that offense again.

But

we think it must have a rational basis supported by civil­
ized thought that is thinkable in our system —QUESTION:

How do you measure civilized thought?

He says you look at what 49 other states do and you say you
don?t have to do that, I gather.
MR. BECKER:

I look' at what the legislature has

done and the apparent purposes for which they have done it.
I attempt to view the reality of a situation

Now, if the

State of Texas says — has chosen to make these offenses
felonies, there is a strong presumption upon the validity
of that judgment, that presumption in connection with the
realities of the punishment —
QUESTION:

But if we are looking at the real world,

General Becker, would it really matter if they said each of
these are a misdemeanor but nevertheless we shall apply our
habitual

offender statute to three misdemeanor convictions

of this kind?
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:

Well —
Would that be equally valid?
Well, it is —

38
QUESTION:

I don’t think the label of felony can

be determinative, can.it?
MR. BECKER:

No, Your Honor, I don’t believe

that the label felony is determinative, no.

I think that

what he has done is determinative, according to how that
state has chosen, the consequences it has chosen to affix
to what he has done.

And I think it is patently obvious

that a man that has a criminal record as Mr. Hummel has
cannot be seriously contended that he is outside the con­
stitutional ambit of what is permissible.

I think the

mere fact that even Texas may be more severe than other
jurisdictions, there is no

constitutional principle that

I know of that federal courts should go around and look to
the most severe statute in every jurisdiction has one —he mentioned theft of goats in Texas -- we used to have a
theft of edible meat statute back from the depression days
with the ranchers, it was tied in, in other words, to a
particular social situation in Texas, it was a very serious
offense.

And I think that the state is entitled to make

those kinds of things offenses, and I didn’t know — and
I am not aware and I don't believe that the Constitution
says —- we look for the strongest statutes that there are,
the most severe criminal ones, and we throw them all out
because they are the most severe.
fallacy in his argument.

I think that is the

He may show that we are more

39
severe in the punishment we inflict, but I donrfc believe
that that is a basis for throwing out the punishment.

It

must be so much more severe, so much more severe that it
appears to be without a sufficient rational basis that it
shocks the conscience, if you will, language that has been
frequently thrown around or expressed I should say in this
context before, and that that is true here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Becker, you spoke earlier and

just repeated now that there is nothing automatic about
this recidivist statute, that it depends first of all upon
the discretion of the prosecuting attorney whether or not
to ask for an indictment under it, and I suppose that is
his absolute and uncontrolled discretion, principle dis­
cretion, that is there is no statutory criteria to guide
him, right?
MR. BECKER:
QUESTIO?!:

That is correct,,

It is

Then you said that it also depends

upon the discretion of the grand jury, that even if he asks
for such an indictment, the grand jury must decide that
this is a proper case in which to return one.

Is the grand

jury given any guidance?
MI?. BECKER:

No, Your Honor, not from the legis­

lature .
QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:

Prom anybody?
Well

40

QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:

How about the prosecutor?
Prom their own consciences is their

guidance.
QUESTION:

It Is uncontrolled, uncontrollable

and standardless diseretion9 is that It?
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:

There are no formal guidelines.
And they are of course unappealable.
That is correct.
One would think the grand jury would

be inclined to indict when they are shown all of the neces­
sary elements of Texas recidivism statutes —*
QUESTION:

They have only the prosecutor and no

defense counsel in front of them.
MR. BECKER:

Yes, that’s corrects Your Honor.

I

don’t have any statistics on how often they agree with the
prosecutor»

I suggest that it is most of the time.

I

suggest that in smaller communities perhaps they may be
more independent than in larger ones, perhaps the reverse
is the case,

I don’t really know.

I don’t think that It

is totally correct to say that the prosecutor’s discretion
is unfettered.

We have existing protections for prosecutors

who are seeking indictments, whether habitual or any other
kind, for impermissible -QUESTION:
won’t be elected

That is , the next time they run then

MR. BECKER:

No, Your Honor, that is ultimately

but even judicially he cannot make a decision of that sort
on an impermissible basis, a racial basis
QUESTION:

Well, what is an impermissible basis

under the statute?
MR. BECKER:

Well, under the statute —• I am

talking about existing case law, prior ease law of this
Court, Your Honor, and Texas courts, not under the statute.
I am talking about invidious or some other sort of discrim­
ination.

I am talking about a prosecutor who is persecut­

ing a particular individual

with the habitual offender

statute and not in the sound exercise of his judgment.
i

There are case law authority given in those kinds of pro­
tections o

There is

at the moment no other formal kind

of protection that he has, as Your Honor has pointed out.
QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:
That's right.

And the grand jury the same?
And the grand-jury fche^same, yes.

Now, of course, we say that remedial measures

are peculiarly province of the legislature.

Nov;, in the

Spencer case in 1967, when it was before this Court, as
the Court knows, by the time that the case got to this
Court the Texas legislature had already enacted a statute
that had done away with the single proceeding that was a
problem in the case and had instituted the bifurcated
proceeding where the jury would not be told until the

42
sentencing phase of trial about any prior convictions that
the defendant hads so remedial legislation had taken place,,
I am aware of remedial legislation in this ease., but it is
not relevant, of course, to the outcome here.
exist.

It may

It Is being undertaken by those persons that we

feel are the proper ones to diagnose the problem and If
there are some results that are impermissible or even if
the results are generally all right but, as Mr„ Justice
V

Stewart has suggested, that batter guidelines should be
instituted.

Perhaps the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals

should review sentence length, as some courts do in some
systems.

There are a lot of systems that perhaps might be

better, and we don1t;debate and don't feel that it is our
burden to show that ours is the wisest system among all
the states, but only that is permissible under the Consti­
tution and that this Court is not the proper forum for
correcting every apparent Inequity in the sentencing
process.
Now, there is one other — the Court knows that
there is an alternate prayer for relief at the conclusion
of our brief, and .just before I close I would like to
emphasize it, and that is that if the Court is not con­
vinced that there is a facial inequity in this case, if it
appears under the Court’s view that the sentence Is grossly
disproportionate for what has been shown — we point out to

43
the Court that there never has been a hearing in this case
in either state or federal court.

Now, Judge Borman,

dissenting in Hart v. Coiner, the famous Fourth Circuit
ease that preceded this one, stated that it should not be
beyond the ordinary knowledge of judges who had been
prosecutors and other kinds of attorneys before they were
judges that the habitual offender statute is rarely enacted
for a person who only has the offenses that is necessary
to formally allege and prove»
Now, if there is any doubt at all about the ex­
istence of that fact in this case, we pray for a remand to
the District Court where we are entitled we believe to show
the full extent of Mr. Hummel's criminal history.

We cannot

believe that if it xfere shown that he had committed suf­
ficient offenses to show to the agreement of everyone that
he is a career criminal in an ordinary understanding of that
word, that we would not be entitled to embark upon a course
of conduct that we have undertaken.
There *\ras in this case no objection at his trial
to the punishment against him.
record might well be different.

If there had been, the
If Mr. Hummel's attorney

had stood up and said we think life for these crimes is too
much, the prosecutor might well at that point have stood up
and said, very well, Your Honor, we would like to hear the
rest of it, we will be glad to proceed.

We didn't have that

opportunity.
In the Federal District Court below, we made a
motion to dismiss along with our answer»

Ultimately we

In essence, we think it is quite

similar to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a
claim,

If the case is going to go off on proportionality
to the benefit of Mr, Hummel, the state would pray that it
go off upon the full basis that we have a full opportunity
to show exactly his history and his circumstances,
QUESTION:

General Becker, just to refresh my

recollection about the Texas procedure, doesn’t the statute
require that the prior offenses be identified in

the in­

dictment?
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:

It does. Your Honor.
Then how would it have been proper

during the trial Itself to introduce evidence of offenses
not described in the indictment?
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:

There is no requirement
If the judge doesn’t have any discre­

tion, once you proved what you did prove he has an automatic
duty to impose the life sentence.
MR. BECKER:

Quite so, but there is still nothing

in Texas law to prevent the introduction of other offenses

45
and his other criminal record.

The Texas lav; precludes the

use of those other convictions not pleaded in the indict­
ment for the procedural sequence which results in enhance­
ment, but they can still be introduced.

And I suppose that

there are cases that where a defendant might take the stand
and in effect might urge, in spite of the prior convictions,
that the jury or the judge, the sentencing authority effect
a nullification, as it is called, that is refuse to find
that the prior felonies are true in order to avoid a life
sentence.

that the court is entitled to presume or that there may

QUESTION:
MR. BECKER:

What do you want us to presume?
I am asking that the Court, as Judge

Borman did in the Fourth Circuit in his dissent, note from
their experience that it is possible that there were other
things known to the prosecutor, that because a statute says
A and B are all that is required, that there may be other
things and that we would be able to show the other things.
We are not asking for a presumption.

We are asking to be

able to meet our burden of proof.
QUESTION:

General Becker, just to refresh my

recollection. Judge Clark’s Initial panel opinion, wasn’t
the relief that he granted that you vacate the mandatory
sentence and send it back for resentencing?

MR. BECKER:

On resentencing hearing, would it not

have been open to the state to put in whatever would be
relevant for resentencing, including these additional con­
victions?

QUESTION:

The state

The statute —

You suggest that even if the Court in

its wisdom thought that 30 years would be a good sentence
in this case —
MR. ATLAS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —
— that Texas couldn’t under its law

impose 30 years?
MR. ATLAS:
could not.

Yo?ir Honor, under its current law it

It could pass a new law that mandated or allowed

it, but it has not gotten.

And the alternatives to the

state are to give the automatic life sentence, if that is
invalid then find another statute justifying the sentence.
They can give as much as they are allowed to under the third
offense, as much as they are allowed to for asecond felony,
but not something not allowed by statute of Texas.
QUESTION:

You don’t think Texas could be ordered

to treat him as though he had a 30-year sentence?
MR. ATLAS:

No, Your Honor, we think not because

that would be judicial legislation I think.
QUESTION:

The —

Well, what kind of a standard do you

think we ought to have —

50
MR. ATLAS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, the standard ought to be —
You suggest some kinds of nonviolent

crimes would be quite all right, and yet —
MRo ATLAS:

Your Honor, the standard ought to be

— and I think the Court could enact a fairly narrow stand­
ard if it chose -~
QUESTION:

Enact?

MR. ATLAS:
I have ever done.

Pardon me, I misspoke and as badly as

The point is if the judge or jury had

given the sentence based on some sentencing discretion,
this Court need not review it.

If the crimes involved some

element of violence or some of these strong social interests
that we have talked about not present here, then the Court
need not review it.
QUESTION:

So you say our standard should be

violent crimes generally but there are some other strong
social interests.
MR. ATLAS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, I think —
And we should go on just on an ad hoc

basis from then on to decide what is a strong social in­
terest?
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, fortunately from all the

research we have done, we found almost no cases where the
Court would ever have a case that
QUESTION:

Well, could you help us by suggesting

51
some — how do we identify one of those when we run into
one?
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, fortunately this Court

has never had one nor has any other court that has ever
dealt with the problem.

I think the drug offenses are

probably a perfect example of that, because of the problems
that legislature normally deal with and make fact-findings
about in the legislative process explicitly or implicitly
before passing those statutes.
The federalism problem that we are talking about
in this case and the potential so-called floodgate problems
that the state refers to in its brief are non-existent.
The Fourth Circuit decided in ?73 and it has not had a
floodgate problem.

Courts in states that have constitutional

provisions allowing review of statutes have reviewed statutes
and sentences for excessiveness and have not had this floodgate problem»

As a practical matter, this Court will never

have to face the problem aga3n.

It has been 200 years and

they have only had one other case argued before.
As to the parole argument, the state has argued
that the possibility of parole ought to be considered.
Ironically enough, Mr. Hummel, if he maintains good time
credit, will become eligible on January 1, 1984.
QUESTION:

The —

You do agree, Mr. Atlas, that the term

'’punishment" in the Eighth Amendment means more than just

52
sentence, that parole possibilities under certain circum­
stances can be taken into consideration?
MR„ ATLAS:

Your Honor.this point 1 cannot

conceive of a circumstance under which I would support the
principle that parole consideration ought to be received
unless there is some statutory entitlement, using this
Court’s language, that would give Mr. Rummel some constitu­
tionally protected rights to be allowed to challenge the
parole board’s denial of parole on whatever basis if the
actual sentence that he served exceeded whatever would be
a reasonable one,
QUESTION:

So you say cruel and unusual punish­

ment means cruel and unusual sentence?
MR. ATLAS:

Among other things, Your Honor»

Sentence is one part of the mosaic of punishment, only one.
There are obviously others.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe a life sentence for' some­

body who behaved himself in the penitentiary and showed
every sign of rehabilitation and adjustment as a good
citizen for these offenses might be cruel and unusual
punishment, whereas a sentence of ten to twelve years upon
such a person might- not be.
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, if a life sentence Is

unconstitutional for three petty offenses, it is unconsti­
tutional for three petty offenses and a surly attitude.

53
QUESTION:

I understand that is your submission,

but I would think that would be not an open and shut ques­
tion.
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, if the legislature had

sentenced Mr. Rumpel to the thumb screws but it provided
that they bring him down if he behaved x^hile on the rack,
we think this Court would not approve the sentence.
The state argues we ought to view1 this case in
reality.

As Judge Clark said in the Fifth Circuit en banc

dissents Mr. Hummel’s reality is that he has a life sentence
with no guarantee or rights or expectations legitimately
that he will ever get out.
One other criterion that the Court has discussed
in its other cases, including Coker, is to examine the
types of punishments that Texas provides for other offenses.
There is only one other offense in the State of Texas for
which one receives an automatic life sentence and that is
capital murder.

One can commit two murders in Texas and

not receive an automatic life sentence although presumably
one would receive the equivalent to one by a Judge or Jury,
And if Rumrael had received a life sentence by a judge or
jury, I wouldn’t be here, I would have a much more difficult
case.

But as we know as a practical matter, no judge or jury

would have given Ruminal a life sentence in this case any­
where in this country, and that is precisely one of the

54
factors and one of the criteria upon which this Court ought
to base its Eighth Amendment decision.
QUESTION:

Well, how do we know that as a factor?

The state legislature did.
MR. ATLAS:

Your Honor, the state legislature in

l85£ did not say that three petty property offenses ought
to bring a life sentence.

Admittedly, it is covered by the

statute, and I would not want to argue that the legislature
did not intend it.
QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:

Right.
But we think there is only so — in

any constitutional decision, this Court is being asked in
some sense to pass on the constitutionality and indirectly
on the wisdom of the state in passing such a statute.

That

is what the Supreme Court sits for.
QUESTION:

Not to pass on the wisdom of any state

statute —
MR. ATLAS:

No, Your Honor, but only to the extent

that a statute exceeds the constitutional limits, and when
it does the statute cannot stand.
The jury in this ease is in Texas under state law
knows absolutely nothing about the life sentence that the
result of its conviction will bring.

It is not clear that

the grand j ury does.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose you would — if the

55
prosecutor here had simply put in the indictment six or
seven crimes„ even though petty crimes, if there were that
many, you wouldn't be here?
MR. ATLAS:

Yes* Your Honor, because the statute

says —
QUESTION:
MR, ATLAS:

Yes, would you be here or not?
Yes, sir, I would be here, Your Honor,

because the statute says three felonies, automatic life.
The state cannot have its cake and eat it. too.
QUESTION:
MR. ATLAS:

We had —

Seven are —
Yes, Your Honor, but the state says

three, any others are irrelevant.

The statute says the

jury and judge cannot consider extraneous circumstances
wher passing on the sentence because upon the proof of the
third the sentence is automatic.

If we can't bring in ex­

traneous circumstances and all the criteria and all the other
facts at the time of sentencing, then the state can't either,
QUESTION:

I will put it to you this way:

Suppose

the judges in the Texas courts construed the law differently
fehar you do, the Texas law, that you may put seven in the
'indictment.
MR. ATLAS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor?
Then if there Is a conviction, would

you be here then?
MR. ATLAS:

"lour Honor, if the statute mandated

56
life sentence upon seven, I would probably not be* here
because I would lose and we cannot forget that under these
circumstances, after all of the criteria have been discussed,
we are talking about a human being who was given a life
sentence for three petty offenses.
Thank you*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen*
