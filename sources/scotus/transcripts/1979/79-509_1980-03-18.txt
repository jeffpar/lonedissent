PHOCEEDI N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argu­

ments first this morning In Exxon Corporation, v. Wisconsin
Department of Revenue.,
Mr, Ragatz, you may proceed wheneveryou are
ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OP THOMAS G. RAGATZ, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF 'TOE APPELLANT
MR» RAG AT Z:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it

please the Court:
This is an appeal from a decision of the
Wi comir Supreme Court that reversed a lower court de­
cision that had excluded from Wisconsin taxat ion the
income of appellant?a expiration and production depart• *

ment earned outside the State of Wisconsin.
The basic issue here* as asserted by the
appellee* is whether a vertically integrated multistate
corporation can be automatically characterised as unitary
and automatically required thereby to subject,its total
corporate Income to apportionment even though,the 'tax­
payer can conclusively identify and accurately measure
its exploration and production Income at Its situs origin
outside; the state»
Now* contrary to the position of the appellant*
the appellee asserts that once a taxpayer is determined

to be unitary and engages in any activities in the state
of Wisconsin., then virtually all its corporate income is
subject to apportionment by Wisconsin and the taxpayer is
not permitted to prove extraterritorial taxation by estab­
lishing either that the income was derived from sources
outside the state of Wisconsin or that the quantity of
income attributable to Wisconsin is out of all appropriate
proportion to the activities of the taxpayer in Wisconsin.
Now, whether or not appellant is found to fee
unitary is not the basic Issue.

Appellant does not con­

cede that it is a single unitary business, but even
assuming arguendo that it is unitary, that does not answer
the question of whether the due process and commerce
elausen of the United States Constitution permit imposi­
tion of the unitary per ss approach with full apportion­
ment, regardless of unrefuted proof that the result is
to tax situs income derived and accurately measured
outside the state of Wisconsin.
Appellant's position her© involves a two-step
analysis;

First, as to what are the constitutional

principles previously defined by this Court to limit
state taxation of extraterritorial income; and, second,
as to whether the appellant5s proof in the record here
satisfies the burden of proof as defined by this Court
tc establish a constitutional violation.

5
The leading decisions of this Court on appor­
tionment are the Hans Rees case decided In 1931a Bass*
Ratcliff decided in 1924, Butler Brothers in 1942, and
more recently Moorman Manufacturing company decided in
1978»

All of these cases are consistent with the propo­

sition that a taxpayer does have and in fact must have
the right — must have the opportunity to prove the
uhconstitutionallty of an apportionment assessment by
establishing a taxation of extraterritorial .income.
In Hans Rees, the Issue was not whether the
taxpayer was unitary, which was assumed by this Court.
The real issue was whether or not the assessment there
taxed income which was earned outside the state of North
Carolina,.

This Court found a due process violation

based upon the taxpayer’s proof that the income attribut­
able to North Carolina was out of all appropriate propor­
tion to the activities of the taxpayer in that state;
thus Hans Rees met its burden of proving extraterritorial
taxation.
This decision was consistent with the prior
Bess, Ratcliff case, only there the taxpayer's proof did
not establish that New York was taxing income not earned
in that state.

Now, despite the fact that the taxpayer

was found to be a so-called univary business, this Court
nevertheless examined the record for proof of

6
extraterritorial taxation* but found such proof to be
lacking.
Butler Brothers involved a siaiilar analysis as
to a unitary business*

This Court decision notes that

the taxpayer failed to prove that the apportionment
formula there attributed to California for taxation In­
come which was earned elsewhere by not showing that the
factors responsible for the income were present in other
states but were not present in California; thus, Butler
Brothers failed to sustain its burden of proof.
Finally, in Moorman, this Court only commented
on the so-called unitary concept in a footnote but did
analyze the record and found that the taxpayer did not
show that a significant portion of its income being
taxed by Iowa was in fact generated outside the state.
The majority opinion by Mr. Justice Stevens notes the
lack of ”any separate accounting analysis” showing what
portion of Moorman's profits were attributable to sales,
to manufacturings or to other portions of the taxpayer’s
operations, and the opinion expressly suggests that it
should not be impossible for a unitary corporation to
prove its actual income from activities in a particular
state.
Mow, we should note parenthetically her® that
neither Bass, Ratcliff, Butler Brothers nor Moorman

7
involved situs income which was geographically located
and accurately measured outside the taxing state, but that
the fact situation here presents such a record for perhaps
the first time for the Court to deal with tangible situs
income derived from natural resources.

Thus, the law as

previously decided by this Court expressly recognizes that
a taxpayer contesting an assessment under an apportionment
cormula must have the opportunity to prove extraterritorial
taxation even though deemed to be a unitary business.
As a consequence, it is clear that this Court
has consistently treated unitary as a possible condition
precedent to the application of an apportionment formula,
but has simultaneously made clear that the factual issue
of unitary is totally irrelevant to the issue of extra­
territorial taxation and to the proof thereof.
Moreover, until the decision of the Wisconsin
Supreme Court, which is here before you —
QUESTION;
would

ds

Except if it weren’t unitary, it

rather relevant, wouldn’t it?
MB. RAGATZ:

If the taxpayer wasn’t unitary,

you wouldn’t meet the condition precedent and yon
wouldn’t even get to the analysis of extraterritorial
taxation.
QUESTION:

Why wouldn’t you, if the state tried

to tax it, why, they would tell them it couldn’t.

8
MRo RAGATZ:

Well, we would be here as we are

now, Mr» Justice White —
QUESTION:

Saying they were taxing out of state

income0
MR. RAGATZ:

We would foe saying that you were

reaching outside the state to tax extraterritorial income.
Now, the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court
— until the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court here,
It seemed apparent that the Wisconsin statute involved was
consistent with the proof prescription contained in these
four decisions I have just mentioned.
Our section 7107 specifies that a corporation
engager, in business within and without the state shall be
taxed only on such income as is derived from business
transacted or property located within the state.

But

here the Wisconsin Supreme Court dismissed appellant’s
unrefuted separate functional accounting proof of income
earned outside the state by labeling as dicta this Court *
prescription In the Moorman decision for proving extra­
territorial taxation by separate accounting analysis.
Thus, the Wisconsin court refused to consider our proof
and adcpted its unitary per ue approach which clearly is
totally Inconsistent with the prior decisions of this
Court.
Mow, under the Wisconsin —

9
QUESTION:

Just as a matter of curiosity, in

your separate accounting how did you allocate the costs
of your central office to operations in Wisconsin?
MR, RAGATZ:

There are two types of separate

accounting in the record, Mr, Justice Blackmun.

There was

separate geographical Wisconsin accounting, but the
separate accounting that we are really relying on here
was the separate functional accounting of the taxpayer!*
three main functional operating departments, exp.loration
and production, refining and marketing.

Now., only the

marketing department engaged in any activities in
Wisconsin, and the trial court found that these three
departments were organised and operated as separate seg­
ments and separate functional operations and this decision
was affirmed fay the Wisconsin Circuit Court on the first
level of appeal.
Mow, the trial court also found that the tax­
payer used Internal transfer prices between fits functional
departments that ware the equivalent to third-party
competitive prices.

Now, that finding of fact was not

even appealed by the state, were not even challenged by
the state on appeal.

The trial court further found that

the income of each of appellant’s functional operating
departments could be determined from its boors and records
without resort to actual third-party sales.

10

QUESTION:

I am sure Mr. Justice B.'laeknmn, as I

am. Is waiting for your answer to his question about the
central office overhead.
MR. RAGATZ:

I am trying to get to that, but I

wanted to give you the background of the facts to answer
the question.
QUESTION:
MR. RAGATZ:

We understand that part of it.
The finding of faqt that the ac­

counting for the functional departments could be deter­
mined from the taxpayer's books and records also was not
appealed, not challenged on appeal.

Now, the fact that

these two findings were not challenged means that the
appellee has conceded the validity and the accounting in­
tegrity of the determination of the exploration and pro­
duction department net income,

Now, that is a long way

around to answer your question, but I felt the background
was necessary.
The central office charges were allocated on
the bacis of similar to a cost of service arrangement
with the various functional departments, and again thi3
was no; challenged by the State of Wisconsin and the
separate functional accounting for each of these operat­
ing departments, including particularly the exploration
and production department, stands unrefuted and unchallenged
in the record.

So that issue

11
QUESTION:

Would you suggest that wherever a.

company claims that it can do this, that it is also claim»
ing that it shouldn’t be treated as a unitary business?

HR.

RAGATZ:

Perhaps not in every cases but

certainly where a factual record is made that demonstrates
conclusively that the income being taxed by a state is
extraterritorials then whether or not the taxpayer is
unitary -QUESTION:

Well3 that part of its business isn't

part of the unit then?
HR. RAGATZ:
QUESTION:

That would be our argument.
So you would say here that the only

unitary business there was in Wisconsin was the marketing
then?
MR. RAGATZ:

That is what the trial court de­

termined and we are well satisfied with that decisions, Mi5,
Justice White.
QUESTION:

But the Supreme Court of Wisconsin

didn't agree with you on that point?
k.H.

RAGATZ:

The Supreme Court of Wisconsin

didn't agree with us on much of anything and —
QUESTION:
finding means?

What do you think a unitary business

Doesn't it mean it is sort of a truism

for saying you must treat it as a ball and go through —
as one ball of wax and go through this formula as the

fairest; way of allocating income source?
MR0 RAQAT2:

Well,, the position of the appellee

would he — and perhaps the Wisconsin Supreme Court —
would t>e that you lock-step yourself into and if you have
any activities in the state, then your total —
QUESTION:

But in your books and in talking

about unitary businesses and allocation formulas9 doesn't
unitary mean that it is sc unitary that it is appropriate
to apply an allocation formula?
MR. RAGATZ:

To be very honest, Mr. Justice

White, 1 can’t say that I know what unitary means because;
it is used in so many inconsistent ways.

It is net a pre­

cise terra certainly In the cases around the country»

It

is not a term —
QUESTION:

But the way it is used in this case,

you would think it automatically precludes your attempt to
separately account,
MR. RAGATZ:

That is the position of the

appellee, as I understand it, and our position is that
that If — that unitary is a superfluous concept and. that
you must look to the underlying constitutional principles
of both due process and the commerce clause to determine
whether a particular activity can be apportioned.

The

test applied by the Wisconsin Supreme Court to determine
what it; unitary begs the question of whether or not the

13
particular activity has any rational relationship to the
activities in the State of Wisconsin which would authorise
the state without violating due process to tax that
activity.

And we assert here that the exploration and

production income which was generated entirely outside
the state, which could be identified at its geographical
location, which could be accurately measured there, and
the measurement has not even been challenged

,

that this

demonstrates that that exploration and production income
is extraterritorial, it has no relation to the state of
Wisconsin.
In fact, we have findings of fact in the trial
court that —» those that I have already cited — indicat­
ing that the exploration and production and the refining
net income had no integral relationship with the marketing
activities that were carried on in the state of Wisconsin.
QUESTION:

What of companies who are conglomer­

ates, even if they are not separately organ!aed as cor­
porations, say they have ten divisions, each division is
engaged in an absolutely separate business, one in making
clothes and something else, running theatres, another
manufacturing trucks, another division which runs banks,
dc they treat each one of them as unitary businesses or
do they
MR, RAGATZ:

Well, I can’t speak for corporations

11}

generally. Your Honor, but my perception and my under­
standing is that each of those, if the proof is proper,
can be identified as separate unitary businesses and only
those businesses who have material activities in the state
of Wisconsin, could be apportioned.
QUESTION:

In other words —

And you are saying that your company

should be treated that way?
MR. RAGATZ:
QUESTION:

I am saying that one of our ---•
You are separate enough, anyway?

MR. RAGATZ:

— due process arguments is that

each functional department can be treated as a separata
unitary business»

But whether or not it is treated as

unitary, the root question is whether the constitutional
principles, particularly the rational relationship
principle permits the state of Wisconsin to reach out
and tax income that the record conclusively establishes
was derived outside the state.
QUESTION:

How many states in the country doss

Exxon do business in at the present time?
MR» RAGATZ:

My belief is all of them, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

I suppose if every state In the

union had the same apportionment as Wisconsin, you might
be taxed more than 100 percent?
MR. RAGATZ:

Tell, not if every state had

15
Identical definitions and identical formulas, but clearly
that is not the case.

While something like 44 states have

three-factor formulas, Wisconsin being one of theca, the
definitions and the manner of application may differ from
state to state such that there is no uniformity.
QUESTION:

I see.

I understand that.

I was put­

ting that as the hypothetical question,*
MR. RAGATZ:

I guess if every state apportioned

in an identical manner, you wouldn’t have the argument
perhaps under due process, but you would still have the
argument that if the situs state where the oil well Is
located had the power to tax all of the income from that
oil well, and other states in addition were apportioning
that income from the oil well, that you would still have
'a commerce clause argument because of the burden of
multiple taxation.
So I don’t think that even a uniform, entirely
uniform apportionment formula resolves the commerce
clause question based upon the situs income which is
here before the Court now, the situs income derived from
natural resources.
QUESTION:

Does this record show oppressive

multiple taxation?
MR. RAGATZ:
Honor.

My position is that it does, Your

The record shows that the Wisconsin assessment

16
here In issue attributed to Wisconsin income out of all
appropriate proportion to the taxpayer’s activities in
Wisconsin which, as you. will recalls were only marketing.
One of the exhibits in the record demonstrates that the
appellee has attributed to these Wisconsin marketing
operations income at a rate equal to approximately two
and a half times the rate actually earned by the entire
rat i*ket ing

function.
QUESTION:

Well, I am asking does the record

show actual multiple taxation, so that you are being
doubly taxed?
MR. RAGATZ:

The record does not show the

actuality of multiple taxation in actual numbers.

The

record does show the geographical locations where the
exploration and production activities are conducted,
which are all outside Wisconsin, and the record shows the
Wisconsin income with and without the inclusion of the
<

exploration, and production income, apportionable income
which thereby pinpoints the amount of approximately $2.6
million of exploration and production income which was
attributed to Wisconsin under the assessment in issue.
Now —
QUESTION:

Does the record tell us whether

Texas uses a three-factor formula or just taxes separately
as you. would have Wisconsin do?

17
MR. RAGATZ:

I do not believe, You:.'3 Honor, that

that is in the record.
QUESTION:

Could I ask one other question.

I

hope I am not interrupting your answer to Mr» Justice
Blackmun, but as I remember the case, the situs sales to
third parties was treated as situs income and excluded.
Am I correct in that?
MR. RAGATZ:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
Is the theory of that exclusion that

those sales were not part of the unitary business or
alternatively that even if they were part of the unitary
business, they should not be treated as part of the taxable
income?
MR. RAGATZ:

Wisconsin has a statute, part of

this statute in issue that says the income from any farm,
mine or quarry shall be allocable and not apportionable.
Now, the appellee conceded on the record that oil and gas
extraction is mining for that purpose.

In fact, the

appelle;© conceded that the principle of situs income by
allocating the sales at the wellhead to third parties and
not apportioning it, but by contending that all the rest
of the exploration and production income is apportionable,
the appellee both invokes the multiple taxation doctrine,
hocause the situs income la subject to the power of tax
outside the state, and It also provides the basis for a

18
due process violation because of ignoring the rational re­
lationship requirement between that exploration and produc­
tion income and the state of Wisconsin,
QUESTION:

May I ask whether the asset factors

and the payroll factors that contributed to the generation
of the sales to third parties at situs were included in
the denoiainator of the formula?
MR. RAGATZ:

My understanding is that they were

nots although they were enluded by something the record
calls a barrel formula which is an extremely complex and
an arbitrary method of dividing the apportionable property
from the non-apportlonable property and the apportionable
payroll from the non-apportion&ble payroll.

The record

will shoi* admissions by the witnesses for the Department
of Revenue that this is an arbitrary separation.

In fact,

sales percentages were used to make part of the adjustment
here in issue, part of the formula, which have no real
bearing on how much property or how much payroll was in­
volved

But 3_f the Court wants to slug its way through

that barrel formula —
QUESTION:

As I understand, there is no real

issue on the fairness of the formula if it is appropriate
to apply the formula.
MR, RAGATZ:

Well, there was an issue below

and in fact part of that issue -was remanded, but that is

19
not. before the Court.

What w® brought here is the basic

constitutional Questions of due process and the commerce
clause B

I would next like to talk about the line of oases
cited in our brief where the identification and accurate
measurement of extraterritorial income subjected to appor­
tionment by a non-situs state shows the risk or buden of
multiple state taxation which thereby invokes this multiple
gaxation

doctrine because the situs states unquestionably

have the power to tax that income.
Mows the appellee assarts that the Moorman de­
cision abandons the multiple taxation doctrine, but I
assert that decision does not so hold and that, rather
than having abandoned that long-established doctrine,
Moorman merely found the taxpayer there unable to invoke
it because of a failure to prove the source or location
of its income.
I believe the language of the Court was that
the taxpayer did not meet the factual predicate.

Well,

that factual predicate I understand to mean that proof
is required as to the situs where the income was derived
but not proof that it had actually been taxed at that
situs.
Now, if the1; doctrine were to be abandoned by
requiring the actuality of multiple taxation, then that

20
would 'iurn state taxation into a foot race with the swift­
est state to tax a particular activity declared the winner»
and I can’t think of a less desirable situation.
1 have mentioned several of the items in the
factual record and, unless the Court has questions, I am
going to pass on with those.

Those are very carefully

laid out in our brief.

I want to mention one, however, that the trial
court did find as a. fact that the Wisconsin taxation of
the appellant’s exploration and production and its refining
net income subjected the appellant to multiple state tax­
ation on such income.

And on appeal at the first level

in the Wisconsin Circuit Court, this finding of multiple
state taxation was affirmed.

However, that was subsequently

reversed9 along with the finding of three unitary businesses
when the Wisconsin Supreme Court took its unitary per se
approach.
Mow, the factual basis for the findings of fact
are unrefuted in the records particularly those findings
of fact that were reversed as a matter of law, and the
finding of three unitary businesses was reversed as a
matter of law without consideration of the facts.

But the

factual record here specifically identifies by separate
functional accounting the undisputed income of the
exploration and production function which was earned

21
entirely outside the state of Wisconsin.

The recoil shows

the geographical locations and it shows the $2.6 million
worth of exploration and production income which is in­
cluded in. the Wisconsin assessment, and all of this income
was subject to being taxed in the states of its origin.
Now, this clearly supports the finding of fact
of the trial court that the assessment at issue subjectecl
the appellant to multiple state taxation.
QUESTION:

Now, the —

Mr, l.agatz, could I ask you one

other question, a factual question.

Lately we have heard

a lot about windfall profits that oil companies may have
earned or may be earning as a result of increase in the
value of oil.

If there are such things, and I guess

they come to a period later than are at issue here, which
of the divisions would earn such profits?

Do you have

any idea?
MR, RAGATZ:

Well, the years in issue here

were 1965 through 1968, so I am not aware of any windfall

profits, and certainly there is nothing in the record that
would Indicate anything like that.

My personal answer

to the question, which is not in the record and I would
have to qualify it In attempting to answer your question,
would be that windfall profits might — if that is an
appropriate term, and. I guess I am not willing to accept
the tern — but large profits might be measured, from the

exploration and production department, where the explora­
tion and production was done in the 1920’s at the 1920
level of prices 9 and the sales of the oil and gas are
done at today’s prices, you are going to show a large
gross profit on such sales which somebody might call a
windfall profit.

But when you consider the replacement

costs of those reserves, it is hard for me to think of
that as a windfall,
I would like to remind the Court that the issue,
the integrity of the determination of the exploration
and. production income is not at issue and the appellee
should not be heard to dispute the fact that the record
shews the correct amount of the exploration and produc­
tion income, nor should the appellee be allowed to dis­
pute the fact that the record shows that that income
was earned entirely outside the state of Wisconsin, nor
the fact that the- assessment in issue includes a signifi­
cant portion of that Income.
Thus, based upon the proof from the Court’s
prescription for finding extraterritorial taxation, 1'
respectfully submit that these facts must Invalidate the
assessment, and I respectfully request that the decision
of the Wisconsin Supreme Court be reversed on the basis
that section 7107 of the Wisconsin statutes Is unconsti­
tutional as applied her® by the appellee to tax the

23
exploration and production net income earned outside the
state, and that such application constitutes a violation
of both the due process and the commerce clauses .of the
United States Constitution.
Thank you»
QUESTION:

Well, you are suggesting the other

side shouldn’t 3ay a word because you are saying that the;/
may not- say that this so-called income that is admittedly
earned outside the state, none of it was earned in
Wisconsin and yet they are taxing it.
MR. RAQATZ:

Thej? are taxing it, Your Honor,

and they have not even challenged on appeal the determin­
ation of that incomeo

And having established in the

record where that income was earned and the fact that it
was not; earned in Wisconsin, we feel that we have estab­
lished the extraterritorial nature of that income and
established that the assessment here constitutes extra­
territorial taxation»
QUESTION:

Of course, I suppose they could say

that this is unitary business and the way to find out
where income is earned is to apply the state formula.
MR. RAGATZ:

But the unitary approach is just

a rationalization then for the state to tax extraterri­
torial Income and it doesn’t get at the root constitu­
tional issues and those issues are whether there is a

rational relationship
QUESTION:

And your approach is just a way to

say the formula is Inaccurate?
MR. RAGATZ:

The formula as applied here results

in the taxation of extraterritorial income * yes s Your
Honor ,
QUESTION:
MR. RAGATZ:

I see,
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Wilcox.
ORAL ARGUI®NT OF GERALD S. WILCOXs ESQ.9
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. WILCOX:

Mr. Chief Justicea and may it

please the Court:
The appellees here ask this Court to reaffirm
what has been already said in Butler Brothers.

Exxon in

the instant case has not challenged the Wisconsin formula.
It has challenged the right of Wisconsin to apply its
three-factor formula to some of its business income.

One

of the terms used is situs income.
Mow* the unitary approach9 the three-factor
unitary method takes into consideration situs income.
All three of the denominators are based on situs.

The

income that appellant is talking about as situs income
is income from a unitary business.

Now* a unitary business

25
is by definition a single3 one business.

Income from such

businesses cannot be attributed to it in part, it cannot
be attributed to parts or to part.

The basis of the

unitary concept is that income cannot be a function of
any given factor, but it is a function of the business.
Situs is taken into cons .1 derat ion by Wisconsin
and by Mo other states who have adopted a similar threefactor formula.

The basis for the formula essentially is

an attempt by the states to find a reasonable formula in
which to tax large multi-state unitary businesses in a
uniform and equitable manner.

I believe that this formula

that Wisconsin has adopted and that several, forty-some
other states have adopted does just that.
Wisconsin is not taxing extraterritorial incomea
Wisconsin has never admitted that these figures shown by
the appellant proves that it is taxing extraterritorial
.income

We are not. disputing a separate functional ac­

counting or whatever they want to call it for their own
business purposes, but they have no income from explora­
tion and production unless this Court Is going to go back
to the imputed income theory.

The income is the income

from their total unitary business,
Wisconsin applied its formula. It taxed 1/500th
of that income.

I do not believe that under —

QUESTION:

Mr. Wilcox, do you believe that

26
Wisconsin could constitutionally adopt a system that your
colleague has suggested that you must follow?
MR. W1LG0X:

Do you mean could we adopt a system

where we tax —
QUESTION:

Could you say all the companies like

Exxon who are capable of doing it are supposed to divide
up their so-called unitary business and do a cost account­
ing job and figure out the income from their various
divisions and If there is income from outside the state
we just won’t take it?
MR. WILCOX:

Well, that is interesting,,

If

the states cook that approach — and I assume that some
wills because they find it advantageous —- what could
result if the corporation has a net loss under that
reasoning, some states could say, well, you may have had
a total loss nationwide,, but you don’t have a loss here,
you’ve got Income here because exploration and production
or whatever it might be, refining, produces income, what
we Would have is we* —
QUESTION:

Does any state that you know of

allow this type of accounting and tax returning that
your eolleagu.e suggests?
MR. WILCOX:

I think some states may have tried

separate accounting themselves.

I know in one case

California did and their own supreme court rejected it.

oo I can't say that no state would attempt ssparate ac­
counting if that might prove advantageous.

I think it is

inconsistent, but I can’t say that, Mr. Justice White.
QUESTION:

Suppose if the exploration and de­

velopment division or what they argue is a separate di­
vision is the most profitable of the three, is it not
likely that the state of Texas might prefer using Exxon’s
approach and tax on that basis?
MR. WILCOX:

If that is where all their income

is, I think it is in other states, but I don’t believe
those states generally do tax it.
they might prefer to tax that way.

But yes - you’re right,
I don’t think they

should.
QUESTION:

Because I suppose just looking at

the state statute, you couldn’t really tell what that
state would regard as a unitary business and conceivably
they could say, well, a unitary business down in Texas is
exploration and development, just as Exxon argues here —
and. I suppose Exxon down there would take the position you
are taking up here,
MR. WILCOX:
QUESTION:

That is possible.
And that certainly raises the possi­

bility of an inconsistent result at least.
MR. WILCOX:

I think one of the basic points I

would like to make is that Wisconsin does have a three-

28

facter formula.

Now, during the period there was one

little discrepancy between some of the states.

We had the

cost of manufacturing rather than payroll, but essentially
it meant the same thing and the enumerator in that case
was zero, so Exxon only came out ahead if anything on that.
But essentially it is uniform,,
And going back to Adams Express and going
through Butler Brothers, this Court has recognised that
it is difficult to tax multi-state unitary businesses„
am not here to suggest anything else.

I am suggesting

there has been an approach adopted by most of the authori­
ties, I think it is a reasonable approach.

to tax exactly that and no more.

It is designed

Unfortunately, a lot of

the states, including Wisconsin, exclude certain income,
so I don’t even think it ever would.
Now, you can constantly attack such a formula
by stating, wall, if Wisconsin had put in payroll some
false figures, they obviously can attack that formula on
that basis.

But to attack the three-factor formula in a

unitary approach through the use of separate accounting
I think is inconsistent with a lot of thl3 Court's

29
decisions —
QUESTION:

Don’t you first have to determine

what the unitary business includes?

I suppose there will

be some out of state income from some unrelated activities
that you just don't count as part of the unitary business.
MHo WILCOX:

Well, I think that is part of

appellant * s argument.
QUESTION:

Well, don’t you?

MR. WILCOX:

I think you do have to determine

what is included in a unitary business, and I guess in
one of the briefs filed by one of the amicus has indicated
that Exxon is not a unitary business in this area.

It has been said that a unitary busi­

ness involves a series of transactions, and I think in
this case you have the typical unitary business where you
have got the flow of goods, you start at exploration and
production, you move to refining, you end up with the
final product being —
QUESTION:

Well, that may be so but I guess in

this case it is just by the accident of legal. entity and
ownership that you can treat it altogether.

I suppose if

all of Exxon’s production was owned by a separate company,
an independent company, and its refining was owned by an
independent company, and its marketing by an independent
company, there wasn’t common ownership but they did

from well to refinery to marketing, it would be —
economically it would be the same operation, but you cer­
tainly couldn’t treat it as. a unitary business.

I guess I would dispute the economic conclusion.

I

think that the determination to ha a corporate structure,

Exxon decided to be under one corporate structure, rather
than three or more -- I think that is a very basic deter­
mination from a business standpoint.

I assume they have a

good business reason for doing it.
Obviously you can share costs, administrative
costs, you can share supply costs.

In their determination,

they came out with the determination that the supply —

three separata subsidiaries, one production, one refining

MR. WILCOX:

Wisconsin would not treat as &

Vinitary business if there is more than one corporate
structure.
QUESTION:
MR. WILCOX:

I see.
In other words, we stay within

the corporate structure.

Mow, I am not sayieg that

31
constitutionally we have to, but we do under the statute.
QUESTION:

And Wisconsin didn’t force this choice

upon Exxon?
MR» WILCOX:

We didn’t force them xo incorporate

as the;/ did, no.

I guess as I have indicated, to suggest that a
business is unitary and then permit the corporation, a
unitary corporation to com® forth and assign certain of
its income to particular departments is a contradiction,
Whs.t you have is saying we’ve got a single business —
that is what unitary means — and now we come back arid say
well, you can break it down in parte, you have a very dif­
ficult problem of attributing income and that is where
the* unitary business concept was conceived.
3: submit that to allow separate accounting
after there has been a determination as'to unitary busi­
ness., to impeach or to break down that business would
mean that the states would literally start over to try
to find a. reasonable way to tax these large multistate
corporations.

I don't think that would benefit either

the; corporations or the states.
The finaly point I really have to make is the
one that was stressed continually and apparently the one
tfc ,fc tie reply brief and the appellant has finally hung
its hat on, is the concept of situs.

This income, the

32
separate income that they talk about — which, by the way,
under their figures is three-fourths of their income —
should belong in a particular place, and the appellee
does not agree with that.

The coiaments as to what the

appellee has conceded, I will not get into, but we do not
concede that.

it is income from the unitary business.

The situs factor is in all formulas, it is in a denominator.
Its situs factor deals with property, you can determine
what property is, you can determine what payroll is, and
you can determine where sales is0

These factors are con­

sidered, they are then used to apportion the income which
you cannot place in a particular spot.

Wisconsin — let me give you a — assume for a second that
the marketing division was the really profitable one with­
in the company, that their accounting showed that, and it
might therefore he in Wisconsin's interests to treat the

think,the Department of Revenue did at one stage of this
proceeding.

Is there anything in the statute, the

Isn't it fairly reasonable to assume

that had that been the most profitable division of the
company, that that might have stuck?
MR. WILCOX."

You are saying that we might not

have appealed?
QUESTION:
MR. WILCOX:

Yes.
I think that might be trua.

I

don't think that would have been right, but chat might
have been true, yes.
QUESTION:

And Isn’t it equally possible that

— I*m just thinking of the possibilities of multiple tax­
ation — that down in Texas they might regard the explora­
tion and development as the separate unitary business?
There is probably nothing in their statute that would
preclude them from doing it.
MR. WILCOX:

No, Mr. Justice Stevens, I am not

here to suggest that all states, any more than all

35
corporations9 act consistently when they see that another
approach would he more advantageous from a financial posi~
tioric

I think they should and I think this Court recog­

nized the fact that in Butler Brothers -- and I think
really in Moorman, Moorman had a single factor formula
which, obviously gave the Court difficulty.
QUESTION:

I would make the suggestion that

Mr. Justice White did, that perhaps the best answer to
this problem would be to get Congress into the act.
MR, WILCOX:

Well. I would hope that we would

not have to wait for that, frankly.

There are all kinds

of methods one can pick, all kinds of approaches,, but we
do have I think a sense of uniformity now, more than we
have had before.

Now, it is not perfect but —

QUESTION:

But the uniformity that you describe

is uniformity in the prevailing practices to use threefactor formulas, but is there uniformity in hew you go
about defining unitary businesses, which is perhaps
equally important but I’m not stare there is the same
degree of uniformity on that problem, is thej’e?

But I bel5.eve that Exxon is a unitary

There may be a business under one corporate

veil that, you know,, is not unitary.
QUESTION:

Your argument, as I understand it,

is than once you define the unitary business then it Is
just a question of applying the formula to find out what
portion is reasonable attributable to the state.
MR. WILCOX:

Essentially, yes, but I think it

has to be properly applied.

I’m not saying, as suggested

by the appellant, that there is no way to challenge the
application of the three-factor formula.

There are.

I

mean you can show we nut in our formula things we should
not have.

We did in fact not include the right property,

for instance.

Those factors, property, sales and payroll,

can be essentially fairly easy to determine on a situs
basis.

Now, there is difficulty.

There is no perfection

there, but I think essentially they can be determined.
Income cannot be.

I think that has been recognised and I

think it is a reasonable conclusion.
Income cannot be assigned to a particular function.
Big, large businesses, and even small businesses — income
—- and the Court has said this in other cases — only ends
up from the final product sales, but you cannot attribute
it only to sales.

It results not just from the three

37
faetor3 used, although those are the three income producones.

It results from the total business, including

administrative costss supply costa, what have you, but you
cannot break it down.

If you could or if we say you can,

there 'fill be no end to separate accounting.

I know what

accounting can do and I know what it cannot do.
There were value judgments in this accounting.
I take them to be good business value Judgments, but I do
not believe that we can subject or you can tax corpora­
tions aased upon their separate accounting analysis or
separata functional accounting.

Financial accounting and

tax accounting do not coincide»

MR. WILCOX:

I guess I wouldn't use the term

nonsense, but I would answer yes, I do believe it better
allocates income because of the judgments -- and I think
they may be reasonable business judgments — but what you
have, Just take the other side of the coin, Let’s assume

39
that, okay, by separate accounting this is possible.

tfhat you have then is that somehow some state is

puted

Income,

I can imagine Exxon’s objection to that.

QUESTION:

But the same guy inevitably In this

kind o:: a setup is setting both the selling price and the
buying price,

I mean there is no real negotiation, is

there ?
MR. WILCOX:

Well, they said it is based upon

Pratt1 o Oil Gram and they claim there is no negotiation,,
but I just — in the oil industry, to suggest; that this
type of pries is one that tax authorities have to accept,
I just can't conceive of how it would work.
QUESTION:

Let me just pursue that for a

i

second ,

I understood that the prices that they used for

the intra-corporate transfers were the same prices that
were generated when they sold at arm’s length to third
parties s and that you in. effect assumed that their ac­
counting had produced results which would have been pro­
duced had the company divisions been independently ownede
Am I wrong in that?
MR. WILCOX:
QUESTION:

Well, I think —
But you said nevertheless you still

40
had fchj right to treat it as a unitary business.
MR. WILCOX:

I think the statements about what

we conceded, right from the beginning those figures were
objected to as irrelevant.

We did not admit to the

validity of those posted fuel prices to the extent that
they compared to price factors sold to third parties,
I still object to it because the fact is the oil wasn't
sold.

If all that oil was sold, they would not have had

the crude oil for their own refineries0

Now, there is

testimony in the record that the reason they operated as
a single corporate structure was because it does spread
the risk, they have supply for their refineries.

They

were able to have enough crude oil so that 70 percent of
their refining capacity would be available by their own
use of the crude.

Now, had they sold it all out, the

price would have obviously been different0

It would have

QUESTION:

Well, General Wilcox, let me put

the question this way:

I sort of thought we were taking

the case as though, like you take a complaint and you
assume what they have alleged is true, even though the
case hasn*t been tried, that the Wisconsin Supreme Court
raoi'e or less took the Exxon accounting as though it
assuming for the purposes of decision, everything they
say is true, that this is good sound accounting and

If it 48.B ac arm1 a length It would have eosie out pre­
cisely the same way, and nevertheless we reach the result
that is is a unitary business and the formula is appro­
priate,

And there is no finding of fact one way or

another, as I understand it, but it seems to me we must
take tie case tht way because if you want to challenge
une accounting then the rationale of the Wisconsin Supreme
Court would be quite different I think, or son I missing
someth Lng?

No, I think you've analyzed the

If we accept their theory and say, well, that may

be trua but nevertheless if Wisconsin (a) is correct in
treating it as a unitary business, and (fa) having so
treated it has the right simply to supply its formula and
not get into the accounting, then we can accept everything
they say about the accounting and still affirm.

But if

the accounting is material, we have to take quite a dif­
ferent analysis, it seems to me,
MR. WILCOX:

Okay.

There are two approaches.

extended.

That would then mean that you would have to

change your formula,

I do not believe it can ever be used

to determine how a state is going to tax* but; I think if
you have a valid formula to start with, and we —
QU33TI0H:

Well, it is also really relevant to

the question of whether it is proper t'o treat as a unitary
business

«cause the whole reason for- the unitary busi­

ness is to solve the problem of how much is fair to
attribute to Wisconsin in seme big business, we don’t
know how much business was done here, and so you develop
the unitary business concept and say we don’t; know, we
will use a formula and that will give us a rough estimate.
But if they can come up with real precise figures that
you would accept, then I suppose that raises the question
of whether you need or is it permitted to use» a unitary
business approach.

I’m not suggesting I know the answer,

but it seems to me the integrity of their accounting may
be relevant to the question of whether it is proper to
use the unitary business device which is a substitute for

^3
accurate accounting when it is unavailable.
MR. WILCOX:

Again, Integrity In accounting, I'm

not challenging it for* the business purpose but I am for
tax purposes and I think you have — that is the question,
and I think if the unitary concept has meaning then you
ddh't have separate accounting to start over again and
break apart what you've put together-.

1 think that the

separate accounting, as the appellant claims it proves,
does not prove that her® at all.
Wisconsin over-reached.

It does not prove that

It does not prove that Wisconsin

is taxing things out of all rational relationship.
QUESTION:

It sounds though, with your colloquy

with Justice Stevens, that you accept the fact that
Exxon's figures with respect to its three departments are
precisely the same figures that they would be if they
were three Independently owned corporatione*

Even so,

you may apply the formula and com© out with quite a dif­
ferent result than you would get if you treated the
marketing division as a separate corporation, as you
would if it were independently owned.

MR. WILCOX:

I don't believe '1 accept their

figures would be the same if they were three independent
corporations®

I certainly don't, because it wou3.d —

QUESTION:

Well, the Wisconsin Supreme Court

accepted the integrity of the figures, didn't they?

But I don’t think that follows

that they said they would to the same If they were three
independent corporations, because I don’t believe they
would.

You have one corporation with different adminis­

trative expenses because of that, I would assume,,

But

nos I think if you had three independent corporations,
you may sell tc each other but there are different re­
strictions on how profit is divided up.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Ragats?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. RAGATZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL
MR. RAGATZ:

I believe I have a minute or two

left.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have two minutes

left.
MR. RAGATZ:

Perhaps I can shed a little further

light in response to some of the questions that Mr®
Wilcox had, but first I would point out that as I under­
stand Mr® Wilcox’s argument, he still really hasn’t
reached the constitutional principles.

He is dealing

with this illusive, ill-defined concept of unitary and
saying that if the state determines that a taxpayer

45
is unl-.ary, than automatically thereafter the income is
subject to apportionment and don’t confuse us with the
facts from a separate accounting analysis because they
donf t count.
Well, you can’t write the Constitution out by
a state? statute adopting an apportionment formula.

The

state is just arguing for unitary per se and not consider­
ing the constitutional principles»
Nowa Mr. Wilcox indicated that we were attacking
the Wisconsin formula.

We have never asserted, that.

We

We are attacking what the

If the formula is applied merely

to the marketing income, we have no problem with that»
But to apply it to the extraterritorial incone which the
record conclusively proves was identified and accurately
measured outside the state, it gets us right square into
both the due process and the commerce clause analysis»
QUESTIONMr. Ragatz, didn't you say earlier
that if the 44 states which applied the three-factor
formula all taxed Wisconsin income of Exxon, like Wisconsin
does, there would be no multiple taxation?
MR. RAGATZ:

I do not believe that was my

answer., Mr» -Justice Rehnquist.

I pointed out I think in

response to that question that that would not solve the
commerce clause problem, because the situs states, the

producing states have the power to tax that situs income
there and for another state to apportionment, even if all
the apportionment formulas were uniform, does not remove
the overlap or the risk of overlap there.
QUESTION:

But is unexercised power a constitu­

tional defect?
MR. E.AGATZ:

The long line of cases that estab­

lish the multiple taxation doctrine have established that
it is the risk or burden of multiple taxation, not the
actuality of multiple taxation»

This Court has said so

in a couple of cases as recent as 1975.
QUESTION:

But the Justice asked you If all

the states operated exactly like Wisconsin and applied
their formula which would be Just like Wisconsin to Exxon,
just like Wisconsin had, there would not be double

In response to —

They have the right to tax it, but

you ars just saying if in the producing state they have an

MR, RAGATZ:

But if that —
It isn't a net income tax.

in that state and then for Wisconsin to use that gross

There are at least six of the producing states

that do tax income at situs.

QUESTION:

Well, on that basis the same thing

if the producing state just has property taxes.
MR. RAGATZ:

is analogous to the situation here at issue.

Mr. Ragatz- do you contend, that It

Is constitutionally impermissible for Wisconsin to treat
this as a unitary business?

impermissible for Wisconsin to put on blinders arid say that

it is unitary and therefore our formula applies, and if
that la what calling & unitary business necessarily en­
tails , it is unconstitutional to treat it as a unitary
