MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-756, Ohio against Roberts,,
Mr. Shoop, I think you may proceed whenever you5 re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN E0 SHOOP, ESQ,f
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHOOP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
am John Shoop, Lake County prosecuting attorney,
representing the State of Ohio, petitioner herein.
I would like to take some time, with the Court’s
indulgence, to explain some of the facts that brought the
case before this Court.
In January of 1975, one Herschel Roberts was arrested
on the charge of forging a check.

At that time he was afforded

a preliminary hearing in the Mentor Municipal Court, at which
hearing he was present; it was a hearing before a judicial
tribunal, a judge; the hearing was recorded; witnesses were
called and sworn; the defendant had the opportunity and the use
of counsel; counsel was present; and other indicia of relia­
bility were present at this time in that defendant had the
opportunity to use the compulsory process of the state to force
the attendance of witnesses.
QUESTION:

Who called the witness that's in question

4

here0
MR. SHOOP:

All right.

At the preliminary hearing

the witness was called by the defense counsel, and it was
expected then that this witness would corroborate something
in light of the defendant's testimony, or anticipated

defense.

The case—the preliminary hearing proceeded, and
after the calling of this witness and the discovery, then,
by the defense counsel, that this witness was testifying
adversely to his defendant, the defense counsel, without
objection from the state, without objection from the court,
began to ask leading and argumentative questions—
QUESTION;

But he couldn't have objected, the other

side couldn't have objected, could he have0

Hadn't Ohio

abolished the voucher rule?
MR. SHOOP:
voucher rule.

Technically; we have abolished the

But we do have a provision that provides that

in this type of situation, the counsel can ask. the court to
declare the witness hostile to allow him to cross-examine the
witness.
Now, of course, with no objection-—
QUESTION:
MR. SHOOP:

He didn't need to invoke that, then?
He did not require—or ask the court at

that time; and that could be because there was no objection
from either the court or the state at that point.
Without—

5
QUESTION:

Well, you say there were some questions

he wanted to but didn't ask, because of any rule of Ohio law?
MR» SHOOP:

No.

The question that he could have

asked was, that he could have asked the court-—
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but he didn’t.

And--but do

you think he terminated his examination of the witness he
called?
MR. SHOOP:
QUESTION:

Of his own free will, yes.
But short of asking some questions that he

wishes now he had asked?
MR, SHOOP:
attorney.
questions.

That's totally within the mind of the

I can't tell you whether he had asked all of the
I feel that—
QUESTION:

As far as the record shows, he was free

to ask any question he wanted
MR, SHOOP:

to-?

And I believe he did.

And I feel he

explored this witness, Anita Isaacs, as far as he could and
wanted to at that point.
The hearing continued, and of course, the defendant—
the probable cause was found, and the defendant was bound over
to the grand jury.

He was subsequently indicted.

Fourteen months later was the trial on the action.
Now, this was in March of 1976.

All of these delays were

caused by either the absence of the defendant himself from the
jurisdiction or, one delay was with the approval of the state;

6
there was one joint request for continuance.
At the trial, the case in chief was presented,
and at one point in the hearing, Mrs. Isaacs, the mother
of the absent witness, was asked if she knew the whereabouts
of her daughter, Anita Isaacs, and her response to that was,
"No," she did not.
Now, this was during the case in chief, the state's
case in chief.

Subsequent to this, the defendant put on his

testimony and evidence, and the defense attorney, knowing the
plan of the prosecution was to eventually submit evidence of
a prior recorded testimony, under oath, of this absent and
unavailable witness, requested before Mrs. Isaacs, the mother
of the absent witness, could leave the courtroom, requested a
voir dire examination for the purposes of discovering whether
or not

this witness was actually unavailable.
This was the defense counsel at trial.
QUESTION:

Well, are you challenging here, Mr.

Shoop, the finding-—the Supreme Court of Ohio is generally
for you in result.

But as I read Justice O'Neill's opinion,

he found quite clearly that the witness was unavailable.

Are

you challenging that finding0
MR. SHOOP:

Not at all.

We do not believe that the

question of unavailability is actually present before this
Court.

We feel that the question of unavailability was not

actually raised.

It was not presented with our argument, in

7
our petition.

We presumed, in our petition, that the unavail­

ability of the witness has already been determined.

It has

been determined by the trial court and by the Supreme Court
of Ohio.
And there seems to be no question of the unavailability
of the witness, and the state's good faith attempts to locate
that witness.
QUESTION:

On that issue, the Supreme Court of Ohio

was unanimous, was it not?
MR. SHOOP:

It appears that—yes, even though we

had a four to three decision in the Supreme Court of Ohio—
QUESTION:
MR. SHOOP:

They all agree he was unavailable?
Yes; both the majority and the minority

agreed that the witness was unavailable.
QUESTION:

Unavailable in the sense, ultimately,

that she wasn't there, or unavailable in the traditional sense?
How do you read the language of the Court on that0
MR. SHOOP:

I read that as unavailable in the sense

that there was no way the State could produce this witness
attthe trial, in order to present her testimony.

And for the

purposes of the statute, 2945.49 of the Ohio Revised Code,
which permits the use of prior recorded testimony under oath,
when, for any reason, the witness is unavailable, the Supreme
Court determined then that this fact is established:

this

\

witness is unavailable for the purpose of this statute.

8
QUESTION;

Under Ohio law—going back now to the

preliminary hearing—under Ohio law is it required that the
person have been subjected to cross-examination, or simply
that the witness was available for cross-examination by the
adverse party?
MR, SHOOP:

That's the very essence, I believe, of

our argument here before the Court, that the opportunity for
cross-examination, in the proper circumstances, satisfies the
confrontation clause of -che Sixth Amendment, whether or not
: actual cross-examination transpires.
QUESTION;

Mr. Shoop, may I ask a question on

availability?
Do you read the state

court's opinion to hold that

i as a matter of state law, the witness was unavailable and—which
is what it seems to say? it relies on the statute.
And then ray second question—I put them both to you
at the same time--is there also a federal requirement of
unavailability, and did the court find that that requirement
was met?
MR» SHOOP;

I read the Supreme Court's argument, or

decision, as that both unavailabilities are satisfied in this
case, both for the purposes of any Federal implications, and
for the purposes of the State statute.
QUESTION;

Bo you agree there is a Federal constitu­

tional requirement on availability?

9
MRc SHOOP:

Yes, ! do.

I believe that is the

predicate for the introduction of prior recorded testimony.
QUESTION:

You, in effect—-you read the Ohio court

as, in effect, having decided two questions on availability.
Issue one is, that as a matter of the state statute, the
witness was unavailable.

And two, the a sufficient showing

was made to avoid the confrontation clause problem.
MRc SHOOP:
QUESTION%

Yes, I do.
You really could hardly argue otherwise,

could you, in light of page 19 of the petition, the blue
i volume, where it says, chief justice—the late Chief Justice
05Neill as saying, at the beginning of the paragraph, "In the
instant cause the appellee argues that the state failed to
show a good-faith effort to produce the witness in person,
| as required by the rule in Barber.
And of course Barber is a case from this Court.
MR0 SHOOP:
QUESTION:

That’s correct. Your Honor.
That’s right, but if you read the last

sentence of the paragraph, the reference is just, to state
law; that's how he answered the question.
And I think the court may have assumed the two tests
were the same.

I wonder if you assume they're the same?

MRc SHOOP:
QUESTION:

I'm assuming that they are, Your Honor.
They are the same0

Whatever would satisfy

a state requirement on availability automatically satisfies

the Federal requirement?
MR0 3H00P;

And in this case, that's what I believe

was decided.
Subsequent to the preliminary hearing and eventual
trial, the introduction of the testimony was permitted of the
unavailable and absent witness.

That was over the objection of

defense counsel,, and defense counsel's objection was to the
Sixth Amendment confrontation clause.
There were two appeals, of course, prior to the
case coming here, and the first appeal going to the Eleventh
District Court of Appeals for the Stats of Ohio.

In that appeal

the Court of Appeals decided that a good-faith effort on the
part of the state was not shown, and that the defendant was
denied his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.
It is from that decision that we, the state of Ohio,
appealed to the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio.

And at

that point, the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio ruled that
the witness was unavailable; we had made every good-faith
effort we could make; and decided that question; but held that
the Sixth Amendment right of the defendant to confront and
cross-examine the witnesses, pursuant to this state statute,
was denied to the defendant when actual cross-examination at
the preliminary hearing did not take place.
It is from that decision the case was presented

11

and is here before the Court.
QUESTION:

Now let me get that straight.

What you

just described, is that the holding of the Ohio Supreme Court
or of an intermediate court?
MRo SHOOP:

That is the holding of the Ohio Supreme

Court.
QUESTION:

Did the Ohio Supreme Court actually

hold that you. had made a good-faith effort?
MR. SHOOP:
QUESTION:

They found that-Or did they say that due diligence would

not have procured the witness?

And are those two not

different?
MRo SHOOP:

I don’t thinlc that they are that different,

significantly different.

I believe that the due diligence

argument, or the statement of the court, satisfies the fact that
we have done what we could do in good faith to provide for
this witness—
QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me the Ohio courts put

some gloss on the good-faith standard.
MRo SHOOP:
Your Honor.

I believe it's a. matter of semantics,

I5m not convinced that that is—-that they said

otherwise.
QUESTION:

Are you relying on the ancient maxim that,

people aren’t required to do what is fruitless and pointless?

12
MRo SHOOP:

That is one, Your Honor, yes,

But I also

believe that the question of unavailability is not even before
this Court.

Now, we have mentioned it, and we have talked about

it, but the question is not properly presented here.
QUESTION:

But Chief Justice O’Neill's

opinion states,

"Therefore the trial judge could properly hold that the
witness \v*as unavailable to testify in person."

That ties right

in with what Mr. Justice Blackmun was asking you.
And your argument is that in the face of that
paragraph, of which I read only the last sentence, there was
j no need to show any effort? that the record taken as a whole

demonstrated that it would have done no good to telephone
California or the social worker or anyone else7
MR. SHOOP:
place for us to go.

That’s correct, Your Honor.

There is no

The question of unavailability, or whether

or not a good faith effort has been shown, relies and presumes
knowledge of the whereabouts of the unavailable witness.
Now, in every instance of the cases that have been
cited, where either the defendant was incarcerated in a Federal
penitentiary, was located in an absent state, was out of the
country in Sweden; in any of those situations, the critical
factor on unavailability, if we’re going to argue unavailability,
is that knowledge of where that absent witness is, exists.
Absent that knowledge—

indicated that at page 10 of the Appendix, where Mr. Perez
was questioning Mrs. Isaacs on direct examination, and he
talked to her about the fact that "I talked to you some five
months earlier in November.

And at that time you indicated

your daughter had been gone and absent for some time." And in
fact, we had knowledge of this.
Where to look?
QUESTION:

We had no knowledge,

Mr. Shoop, is your answer to Justice

Biackmun, that because of the prior history, you did nothing

MR. SHOOP:

There was nothing more for us to do.

QUESTION:

You did nothing more than he described

in his question?
MR. SHOOP:

That is correct.

14

QUESTION;

Yes.

QUESTION:

Your answer to both my questions is:

"Nothing"0
MR0 SHOOP;

I—-I apparently have forgotten the other

QUESTION:

I asked, generally, what you did other

than serve the subpoenas at the residence of the missing
witness 8 parents.
MRo SHOOP:
QUESTION:

We did talk with the parents.
And I fake it the answer to that is

nothing, and I asked you positively what else you did.

And

I guess the answer to that is nothing, other than talk to the
parents, and know she was gone.
MR, SHOOP:
QUESTION:

Yes; and they did not know where she 'was.
But you also knew she had been in

San

FRancisco, some other places, didn't you°
MRo SHOOP:
in San Francisco.

Yes, we knew there had been a contact

That was one month after—-one or two months

after the original incident, which would have been in April or
May of 87!i.

Subsequent to that hearing, or that notice, there

was a notice in the summer-—
QUESTION:

Are you referring to page 11 of the

transcript, where the question is:

Oh, you talked to your

daughter, and is that the last time you talked to her?

And

15

the answer is, no, she called again later in the summer.

We

don't knew where she called from7
MR. SHOGP:

Correct, Your Honor.

That's what I'm

referring to.
And at least in November the state was aware of the
fact that this witness was gone and absent.

And we had

no

knowledge of where to go from that point to locate her.
Now, what more the rules would require of us, I
cannot imagine.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose there hadn’t been this

opportunity to cross-examine at the preliminary hearing.
she hadn't been a witness there at all.

Suppose

And yet you had a—

sufficient for the purpose of the preliminary hearing.

Would

you have done any more?
It's convenient to have this preliminary hearing
transcript available, isn't it?
MR. SHOOP:
convenient.

Oh, it's—yes, Your Honor, it is.

It is

If that is the application that is used of this.

But in this case the witness was unavailable.

And it is not

unavailability due to any neglect on the part of the prose­
cutor, or any hindrance by the prosecutor.
What more we could have done, whether or not this
witness was here, if this were a crucial witness, crucial to
the facts and to the establishment of the crime, the
prosecutor might be left with no alternative

but to decide

16

whether or not to proceed on the case.

Because this was not

a crucial witness at this point, we were left with whatever
means we could have at our disposal to find the witness, once
we have some indication of where that witness might be.
The question then presented is, where a witness,
called by a criminal defendant at a preliminary hearing,
testifies in a manner incriminating the defendant, and was
not cross-examined, although there was opportunity to do so,
and that witness is later shown to be unavailable to testify
at the trial, the same defendant on the same charge, does the
confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment of the constitution
of the United States preclude the state’s use of an unavailable
witness” prior recorded testimony?
The use of prior recorded testimony of a witness who
is unavailable for trial is not repugnant to the constitution
or the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment, when there
are certain indicia of reliability.

Those indicia of reliability

outlined by the various cases that have been cited include a
full-fledged judicial hearing with sworn and recorded testi­
mony? the defendant being present? counsel being present? and
the opportunity to cross-examine the witness.
We submit that all of the indicia of reliability
were present in this case, plus others.
Secondly, the opportunity to cross-examine the

witness is the key to whether the demands of theconfrentation
clause are met, not whether actual cross-examination took
place.

And the Ohio Supreme Court, in its dissent, summarizing,

Barber, Ghreen and Pointer,

which are United States Supreme

Court cases on this, said that the extent of the cross-exami­
nation, whether at a preliminary hearing or at a trial, is a
trial tactic„

The manner of use of that trial tactic does not

create a constitutional right»
Thirdly, the unavailability, the question I believe is
not properly before this Court, and the question presented in
the petition for certiorari presumes the unavailability, and
the respondent did not cross-petition on this issue, which

he

now attempts to raise.
Further, both the trial court and the Supreme Court
of Ohio have determined the witness to be unavailable as a
matter of fact, and that determination should not be
disturbed.
Finally, where the testimony is taken at a fullfledged judicial hearing, the opportunity to cross-examine
satisfies the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment,
regardless of the use made of that opportunity.

A full-fledged

judicial hearing existed here in this case, which closely
approximates a trial.
Green mentions factors of a full-fledged hearing.
And they are, as 1 mentioned before, the judge hearing the case,

the witnesses under oath, the counsel and defendant present,
the judicial record to assure the accuracy of the statement
and the recording, the opportunity to cross-examine.
QUESTION;

Well, frequently, counsel, at a preliminary

hearing, your defense lawyer's best tactic is to keep his
mouth shut, because all the prosecution has to produce is a
probable cause to bind over.
I take it here the defense lawyer went further ana
called a witness of his own?
MRo SHOOP;
QUESTION:
MR. SIIOOP:

That is correct.
And that is this particular witness.
And that is this particular witness that

we are now confronting this Court with.
Furthermore, besides the standards laid out in Green
for a full-fledged hearing, this defendant was afforded, in
addition, the use of the rules of evidence in the state of
Ohio, full use of evidence.

The rules of evidence are mandated

I

for preliminary hearings in the state of Ohio,,

Compulsory

process, the full panoply of the criminal rules and the trial
procedures are available for the defendant’s use.
Now once we've established that the prior recorded
testimony was taken at a full-fledged judicial hearing, then
we submit that the opportunity to cross-examine satisfies the
confrontation clause, regardless of what use was made of that
opportunity.

19

That can be explained by the fact that a witness
called on direct knows that they will be subject to crossexamination, and yet whether actual cross-examination takes
place is not known until thecompleticngof the direct examination.
Therefore, the motivation to testify truthfully is
just as valid before the cross-examination as it could be
after-wares.
Secondly, we submit that the confrontation clause is
not a right which must be knowingly and voluntarily waived, as
certain other Sixth Amendment rights, for example, the right
to counsel.
We submit that the confrontation clause, and the
opportunity to cross-examine is comparable to the compulsory
process clause which was afforded the defendant.

And regardless

of whether or not the defendant makes use of that compulsory
process clause, or waives that right, he does not have to
waive, or give a knowing and voluntary waiver, of that right
to compulsory process.
We submit that the opportunity to cross-examine falls
within that Sixth Amendment right.
There

have been some objections throughout the

briefs raised to this opportunity alone satisfying the
confrontation clause.

The Eleventh district Court of Appeals

for the State of Ohio stated that confrontation is a trial
right; and that is correct.

We do not dispute the fact that

20

the confrontation right is a trial right»
But it is not an absolute right.
right, as Mattox so noted.

It is a preferential

According to Mattox, the law in its

wisdom declares that the rights of the public shall not be
wholly sacrificed in order that an incidental benefit may be
preserved to the accused.
The substance of the constitutional protection is
preserved to the prisoner in the advantage he has once had of
seeing the witness face-to-face, and of subjecting him to
cross-examination.
The second argument that has been raised is the
difference in structure between the preliminary hearing and
the structure of the trial.
In Ohio the structure of the preliminary hearing
follows close to the criminal rules, and provides a full
panoply of constitutional safeguards.

The defendant has the

absolute right to be present? the absolute right to counsel?
the absolute right to compulsory process? the absolute right
to cross-examinationj -the full use of the rules of evidence.
He has—he's entitled to witnesses under oath and a judicial
tribunal»
These are absolute rights preserved to a defendant
in a preliminary hearing, and they so closely approximate the
trial that there is rarely much of a difference in the
structure,

21

Thirdly, there is a strategy argument, where counsel
at a preliminary hearing may be-“-may not use the same
strategy as he would at trial.

But as an advisory opinion,

and I believe a we11-reasoned opinion, the Sixth federal
Circuit Court of Appeals, in Havey v. Kropp, cited in our brief,
states that where a state statute exists which allows use of
prior recorded testimony, and counsel has notice of the statute,
and the attorney chooses not to use the preliminary hearing—-or
chooses to use the preliminary hearing as a fishing expedition
or to fail to explore the weaknesses in the State's case, does
so at his client's risk.
In this case, we do have a state statute in question
which was in existence at the time of th©preliminary hearing,
and was well known to defense counsel.

And that state statute,

2945.49 of the Ohio Revised Code provides that prior recorded
testimony under oath can be used at a subsequent hearing when
the witness is unavailable.
Finally, the defendant in this case actually did
make use of his right to confront the witness here, which
establishes compliance with the confrontation clause.
was de facto cross-examination of the witness.

There

The totality

of the circumstances under which the testimony is taken,
including the leading and argumentative questions afforded the
jury at trial, a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth
of the testimony.

22
Thus we submit that the Supreme Court of Ohio was
in error when it held that the prior recorded testimony of an
unavailable witness was constitutionally inadmissible.

The

judgment of that court should be reversed.
MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN R. PLASCO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 0
MRo PLASCO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We would wish to expand upon the facts for this
Court that petitioner has given to give you some additional
information.

petitioner was arrested on January 7th, 1375=

His preliminary

hearing was had three days later, January 10, 1975.
time he had appointed counsel.

At that

I don't know if the counsel

had seen him prior to the preliminary hearing or not.
His entire defense-“this is a forgery case, and also
some receiving stolen property, some items, a chalice, some
silverware—-his entire defense

was that his, quote, girlfriend

had given him certain items, that she had given him a checkbook
written by her father, the complaining witness, and that she
gave him permission to use these items.
At the prelirainary hearing, which is a probable

23

cause hearing—and we respectfully differ:

It is not a trial,

the constitutional rights are different—-at the preliminary
hearing in this matter, the complaining witness, Mr. Isaacs,
Bernard Isaacs, was present , I assume, since I was not the
attorney then, because he was to identify the checkbook and to
identify the stolen objects, alleged stolen objects.
At that time, the defense counsel saw Anita Isaacs
I in the hallway.

She was not subpoenaed.

He called her to

i

' the stand.

He called her to the stand as his witness, subject

to direct examination.
There were three or four leading questions, not
objected to by the city prosecutor in that jurisdiction.

The

i: witness testified adversely.
The Court of Appeals below stated that you can infer
from her actions and her credibility that she was closely
i linked to the defendant.

'!

QUESTIONs

That's pretty much of a tactical judgment,

isn't it, on the part of a defense lawyer at a preliminary
hearing, whether you call any witness or not, and if you call
anyone, how much you ask him?
MR. FIASCO:
correct.

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is

Whether or not I would have called this witness or

not is really not at issue.

He did call this issue on direct.

But it certainly was not a cross-examination—•
QUESTION:

Well, you say it’s not cross-examination,

24
but when he saw she was beginning to crawfish on him,- so to
speak, he began asking her adverse questions.
MR. PLASCC:

Well, he asked her adverse questions

right from the start—-I shouldn’t say adverse? he asked her
leading questions right from the start.
QUESTION:

Yes, and when the leads weren’t followed,

he began asking really genuinely hostile questions, the way
you would on cross-examination?
MRC PLASCOs

I would respectfully disagree.

Reading

the transcript, X don't think anything was more difficult than
it would take somebody to answer in 30 seconds, or so.

I don’t

think it was a trial type of cross-examination.
QUESTION:

Well, I don’t mean an extended thing.

But

it was not the kind of questions that you would ask of your
own witness whom you were assured was going to answer the
questions the way you thought the person was.
MR. PLASCO:

I can assume not; that's correct.

But again, I don’t believe it was an extensive crossexamination.

At any event, the defendant-petitioner was bound

over to a grand jury, subsequently indicted.
up for trial.

The matter came

I was appointed his defense counsel approximately

in February of '76, a little bit over a year later.
The matter was set for jury trial March of '76—-I
don't have the date in front of me; March 4th, I think, 1976.
And it went to trial.

25
At the trial, in—-after the witness for the state,
Mrs, Isaacs, testified, I as defense counsel requested a voir
dire of Mrs. Isaacs to determine unavailability.

There is

*

nothing in the record to show unavailability up until the
point that I as defense counsel requested it.
After Mrs. Isaacs testified, and then-—the defendant
testified—when they rested, the defendant testified, the
State of Ohio as rebuttal brought in the transcript of Anita
Isaacso
The trial court said that—over my objection; Sixth
Amendment objections--that she was unavailable, and allowed
the transcript in pursuant to 2945.49 of the Ohio Revised
Code, prior recorded testimony under oath regarding preliminary
hearings.
The defendant was convicted.

The matter went to the

Court of Appeals, where it was reversed and remanded.

The

court, adopted the Honorable Justice Marshall’s opinion in
Barber v„ Page at length, and said that the prosecuting
attorney’s office did not make a good faith effort to locate
her.
In fact, there were some interesting issues that
were not brought out.

According to counsel herein, they

knew of her unavailability in November of '75.

Yet the

record-—and it’s u.nobjected to, and as a matter of fact, the
Supreme Court says it’s allowed to issue---

26

QUESTION:

But you didn't-—you had a clear holding

from the Ohio Court of Appeals that the showing of unavailability
was insufficient.

And yet you didn't cross-petition fromthe

Supreme Court of Ohio's judgment on that.
MR„ PLASCO:

No, sir, I did not.

I had raised the

constitutionality of the statute in the Court of Appeals, and
when I was successful, I dropped the statute—-constitutionality
question, and just went upon the issue of Barber v. Page.
QUESTION:

So you didn’t even argue to the Ohio

Court of Appeals on the unavailability question?

Yes, I did, sir.

What do you. have to say about the Ohio

Supreme Court's statement in the opinion from the facts which
you have recited and which the judge digested, that the trial
judge could reasonably infer that Anita had left San Francisco,
and that it would have been fruitless for the prosecutor to
contact the San Francisco social worker in order to locate
her?

MR e PLASCO:

QUESTION;

Yes, I know you disagree with it.

But what

more do you have to say about it than that you disagree with it?
MR» FIASCO;

The Court of Appeals--the Court of

Appeals said there were about five different cireas in which
this could have—in which they could have done more investi­
gation, or done things in; and they did nothing, the prosecutors'
office.

In fact, the Court of Appeals’ decision , no matter

what they said, they did nothing, absolutely nothing.
And they acknowledged that.

QUESTION:

Here5s—this holding of the Ohio Supreme

Court tells us, does it not, the statute is constitutional,
in one sense, does it not?
MR. PLASCGs

Well, the are a-*--the issue was not

28
addressed in my brief in the Ohio Supreme Court; it was only
addressed in the Court of Appeals.

And after being successful,

I dropped the issue of 2945.49 being unconstitutional.
I don't think the issue—
QUESTION:

Well then are we not confronted with ,a

statute held constitutional by the highest court of the state
: which had authority to pass on it, and a further factual
j determination that it would liaise been fruitless for them to
do any of the things which you now complain they did not do°
MR. PLASCO:

We are here before the Court with a

j!

statute which must be presumed to be constitutional, yes,
although I personally have other feelings.

This is not an

issue is not an issue at hand; I acknowledge that, because I
did not raise it.
The factual determination at the Court, of Appeals
and at the Ohio Supreme Court were different.

I will argue

in a few minutes—maybe I should argue it now—that regardless
of whether she was available or not, because of the indicia
of reliability, the Sixth Amendment is such that any recorded
testimony under oath should not be admissible.
I don't—-but our asecond argument, Barber v. Pane,
is that they didn't make the good faith effort to locate her.
In the—-they didn't do anything, actually.

And if they

claimed they had notice in November of '75 that she was
unavailable, when, then, did they issue five subpoenas, the

29

last of which was in February of ‘76°

There's some confusion

there.
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps to anticipate the argument

that you’re now making that they didn’t do anything.
MRo PLASCO:

Well, the subpoenas indicate, accordincr

to the record, that they were served upon her.

To rne, they

had a transcript in hand, and why bother doing anything more,
since they had the transcript in hand0

And just use the

recorded transcript to convict the defendant.

I think that

was the approach they took.
QUESTION:

Do they still have the ’’syllabus .rule"

in Ohio?
MR. PLASCO:
QUESTION:
MR0 PLASCO:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, sir, syllabus rule0
Yes.
I don’t know.
If they do, then the opinion of Chief

Justice O’Naiil is just a little essay, and the law of the
case is in this one paragraph syllabus.
MR» PLASCO:
QUESTION:
MRo PLASCO:

Oh, yes, yes, we would——
You still have that rule''
Yes, I do believe we have it, now that

I think about it.
Our main premise is that petitioner failed to show
that Anita Isaacs, the witness herein, was unavailable and-—

30

excuse ne, strike that.

Let me go to the second argument.

The preliminary hearing testimony of Anita Isaacs
lacked the indicia of reliability necessary for admission
as an exception to the confrontation clause.
To put it on a more national frame, it's our
position that where a witness testifies at a preliminary
hearing, or any prior recorded matter, be it an examining
trial like in Texas, like a magistrate’s court in some other
jurisdictions, or a preliminary hearing in Ohio, the Sixth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the confrontation clause,
specifically precludes the use of such recorded testimony,
notwithstanding 2945.49, if the witness is not cross~ex£urnined,
and even if there is cross-examination, if the cross-examination
is brief and ineffective, therefore lacking the indicia of
reliability.
It’s our position, therefore, that even if this
Court, this Honorable Court, determines that she was unavailable,
since it was direct examination, since it was not crossexamination, since the preliminary hearing lacked the indicia
of reliability as brought out in Dutton v. Evans,

the

preliminary hearings testimony, the recorded testimony,
should not have been admitted in the court in the case at bar
below.
We cite to the Court a number of cases;

the Ohio

Supreme Court in the Roberts case below talked about—that

31

the issues must—at the preliminary hearing—must be similar
to the issues at the trial court; they use the words "similar
enough."
And we argue that a preliminary hearing is a
probable cause hearing.

They believe a crime has been

committed, and that a defendant has committed it.

While

a

trial is certainly proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
As a trial attorney, the burdens are so odifferent.
One is a perfunctory type of matter which lasts only a few
minutes.

I would respectfully disagree with counsel that the

constitutional rights are not the same.
QUESTION:

Does this record show how long this

preliminary hearing—
MR. FLASCO:

Well, I don't really know, timewise,

but I would gather it was less than an hour.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s more than a few minutes,

isn’t it0
MR. PLASCO:

I’m talking about all the witnesses.

We are fortunate in ray county that they do have witness
chairs where teh witnesses take the stand and are asked
questions under oath in a more formal standard. In some
?
jurisdictions, such as Cogga County, Ohio, Cleveland area,
there’s no—the witness are all brought up to the bench,
and in the middle of direct examination, the municipal judge,
says, bound over, and that’s it.

Green argued substantial

But I think Green definitely did not say that

just because there’s an opportunity to cross-examine,- one
has cross-examination.

There are two separate and distinct

And I think that5s—throughout all our history, all
the cases that we've brought before this Court, the Reynolds,
I Mattox, Motes, Pointer—which is a right of counsel case,
Barber, Green - Dutton, Mancnsi, the facts are such, where

The Roberts decision below, Chief Justice—

We think they can be the same, not always being the

If counsel does not do an adequate job at a preliminary

hearing on cross-examination, there is no indicia of reliability

Therefore, the recorded testimony should not be admissible

The witness—

And the testimony was

admitted for the second trial.
The Court said, although the- purpose of the confron­
tation clause is to protect ex parte affidavits or depositions,
we allow it in out of necessity and occasion.

I would summarize

that as an interest-in-justice type of argument.
We would say that where justice would not be met
by now allowing it in, the Court would not take that position.
I would differ with counsel in his arguments about
Anita Isaacs being a crucial witness.

She was a very crucial

witness to the case, and therefore the Dutton of, you know,
crucial and devastating witness—there were 20 witnesses who

37
testified in Dutton—is not applicable.
We strongly ask this Court to consider the fact
that a preliminary hearing, a probable cause hearing, and a
jury trial, are two different, if 1 may use the term, animals,
that one purpose is just, I think as Justice Rehnquist said
earlier, is just to determine probable cause.

The strategy

may be to use minimal cross-examination.

and the State has not had a chance to prepare these witnesses

may call them to the stand and put their testimony under oath,

QUESTION:

Well, you're talking about a very, very

rare type of case where it's not your witness that you're
calling—*

MRo FIASCO:
QUESTION:

No, I would never—
—but a state's witness that the state

is not calling.
MRe FIASCO;
QUESTION:

Correct, Mr. Justice-™
Why would that be so wrong, anyway, as a

matter of tactics7
MR. FIASCO:

Because you're putting your own witness

41

under oath at a prior recorded testimony, and they cannot
change—not that we would have them change their testimony;
don't get me wrong.

I’m certainly not insinuating that.

It’s just that at that point, we don't really have time to
investigate to determine the full matter.
Initially, a lot of cases will look very good to the
defense.

And then as we get into them more and more, it turns

out that may have seven or eight different witnesses that
point the guy out as the one at the scene of the crime.
So our second argument was that this would create
havoc in the municipal courts.

It would require, maybe,

half-day, all day preliminary hearings; or if the court only
adopted his rule in part, it might force us to waive crossexamination on some cases rather than dare even cross-examine
for fear of having the compliance with the Sixth Amendment.
But most likely it would cause extensive prelims.
It would cause continuances so we can do investigations.
And the municipal courts are not geared for that.

Nor would

the judges in the municipal court tolerate that.
I think the third argument that we have, which was
addressee, briefly, was the unavailability.
address that.

I'm not going to

I'm just going to say that under Barber v. Page

But even if she is unavailable, which we differ
on, and we did not cross-petition on it, and I acknowledge
that, we're arguing strenuously that the Sixth Amendment
still

precludes prior recorded testimony where there's no

indicia of reliability, hence, no cross-examination, or where
cross-examination is ineffectual.
The Ohio Supreme Court, after deciding Roberts,
decided State v. Smith, cited in one of the amicus briefs
and I think in petitioner's brief.

There, they felt in a

rape case that the cross-examination was so ineffectual
that there was no indiciaof reliability.

They didn't use

the v;ordr, "indicia of reliability," but again, there was
nothing there for them to introduce it at trial.

Therefore,

it would be a Sixth Amendment violation.
We would ask this Honorable Court to affirm the
decisions of both the Eleventh appellate district and the
Ohio Supreme Court.

even if finding the witness unavailable, the differences
between preliminary hearings and trials are so different that

It may not have been relevant.

As to the argument of lengthy prelixainary hearings,

47
causing court congestion, we’ve heard, a number of arguments
from defense counsel about timely trial.

And. of course the

state of Ohio has rules about time to trial, for speedy trial,
and they’re statutory.

The rules require that a criminal

defendant, once he has been arrested, be brought to trial
with 270 days.

If he’s incarcerated on that charge without

bond, he must be brought to trial within 9Q days.
These stipulations and charges that this would causa
court congestion were raised, of course, when those statutes
came into effect.

{Whereupon, at 2s02 o'clock, p.ra., the case in the
