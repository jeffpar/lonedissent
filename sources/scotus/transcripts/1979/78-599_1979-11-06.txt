brought this case as a cl lSB action on h.t,.ilf of all

Hero as in Brown v. Glineo, respondents

sought declaratory and i:ijunctive relief aqainst military re.g11lations that roquire the prior approval of the base conunander
before petitions may be

v. Glines, the CO\li't of Appeals held that the regulations
are

under lOOSC 1034, as uppliod to the on-base dis1:ri-

bution of petitions t:o m$Abers of Congress.

communications rather t han group petitioning.

think the

legislative history on that is clear.
Second, even if group petitioning were cCXT11nunication
within the meaning of the statute, the Navy and Air Force regu-

lations do not restrict the communication of such potitions to
Congress.
The military's u11willingness to open military facilities to public activities traditionally prohibited ia not a
restriction on the camnunication "of 'the petition i taelf.

If

the Co-..irt agrees with either of those aubmissl.ons , it need not
reach the third issue under the statute which I will discus!! at
this time.
AsirJ111ing for the PllrPOBes of discussion t?nt the
regulations in

restrict the communication of peti-

tior..s to Congress, the statute allows rsstrictions imposed
under regulations that a:ce nocessary to the natioM 1 security.
The only legislctive history concerning this pcrtiL'Ular
languaga in

st.atutes refers, of

to individual

comm11n!cation:s.
con'}r 9srnan Vinson stated that the statute lets any
serviceman •w:.. ite his Congresonan on auy subject if it does

didn ' t thin):; the statute applied to this group petitionioq
acti vity.
But the Court of Appulu both here and i11 the
Glines case rec:oqnized that the regulatory objective 0£ insur ing a discipline prepared military force ia essential t:o
na t ional sucurity.

The courts held, however, that the prior

approval requiranent is necesaary to achieve this
only in a ca:nbat zone, a"ld that outside a ccnbat zone postpunia!'l:lent is sufficient.
The implication of the court's reasoning ae we see
it is that the need for troopn to be fully prepared for immediate action is materi3lly less outside a ccmbat zone than
within one.

But the proolo with that

iu that as a

practical matter it is unre.ilistic.
Tho military c-.nnot krow t<rlay and doesn't know today

'

where troops stationed a·= the strategic air b&se

Guam in-

volved in the Glines casa or Lt the cattbat ready marine
in Japa.'l involved in this caso, where those troops mny bo
called upon to serve toa)rrow.

It is simply admonistic to

auggost in an age of jetR and missiles that.only troops in
a conbat zono must be fully prepared for immedite action.
Certainly tho court• s ra.i.oo.'l:l.nq is incorr&et as applim to
th;o, :.dvanced defencs b:lBIJS involved in these two czisos.

He testi-

fied that the highest standards of discipline and

are

essential for readiness as well as for combat itself.
Well, there -sn•t any contrary evidence, expert or
otherwise, in the record.

But th

Court of Appe&ls simply dis-

agreed with the military assesfllllent.

It's difficult, we con-

cede that it's difficult to know with certainty what is
sary in any particular situation to insure military prepared-

neas.
As Judge Leventhal said in an analagous context, in

Culver v. Secretary of Air Force, however, "Whereas in this
case the military determinal::ion 16 based on reasoned policy
rather than on capriciou3ness, it ahould be sustained.•

However, we believe that if you look at the word "com-

The language itself is not

There are no restrictions as to what an individual

wording of the individual action.
The intent was clear, and that was to eliminate prior
command review.

And

the court below found that there w.as no

indication that the outer limit was an individual petition, and
the court in Allen v. Monger, which is pending before this
Court, also looked at the nmendrnent changes to the statute,
the historical context, and concluded similarly that the scope
of 1034 was b8'/0nd an individual letter.

like to refer to.

First, reapondent Huff requested the com-

mander of the F:f.rst Marine Aircraft Wing to circulate a petition to Senator Cranston involving the use of military in labor
disputes.

He wanted to circulate that in the barracks.

He was

going to circulate it out cf uniform, off duty, no use of
government materials, he wculdn 't interfere with mi.litary perDOnnel on duty.

In fact, all requests in this case were ac-

companied by similar language.
'l'hr- weeks later that request was denied, the car.-

mander saying the petition contained gross misstatanents, implicatione of law as fact, as well as impugning by innuondo
the motives and conduct of the COlt;lnander-in-chief of the Armed
forces in the exercise of hio con&tituticnal responsibilities.
"To authorize permission to circulate scch grossly
'

erroneous and misleading co=entary would be contrru:y to ray
responaibility as a c0111111ander to maintain good order and diacipline and afford prope' guidance to tha men under my com-

mand. •
It's clear

this denial that in fact tho command-

ing officer was denying this request on the basis of tho content.

If the regulation is

n"ed go any further and get into the

f acts of your case where perhaps the camnanding officer exerc ised his discretion on an improper basis?
Your Honor, I think what is

MR .

important about the facts here ia that we have a series of requests, a series of denials, a total misuse of the regulations,
concee aion by the govermaent that all of these were iClproper,
every last one of them, and it shows that in fact, if these
regulations or similar type regulz>.tions are going t.o be in
existence, that the right to petit:iton is not a right that is
going to exist within the roilitary.
QUESTION:

In foreign countries?

MR. DRAl!ITZKE:

To tho extent that the sane require-

ment is obtained on a state-side base,

I

think the answer is

still the same.
QUESTION:

I

But all yo1.tr case involves is foreign

countrios?
MR. DRANITZKE:

Thllt i.s correct.

The second fact situation was, the Respondent
reque3ted permission to circulate a petition to Congressperson
Dellllllls in supp0rt of mnne ty, ac

on the same day that the

Huff petition was denied, the comircanding offic.er denied that
petition under the s
inq

nd

e rC<JUlatior with the exact eame reason-

ithi

f

20

the regulation that he was supposedly acting under. Again, a
c lear disagreement of the content of what was being distributed.
Similarly, respondent Gabrielson requested perndssion
t o distribute a letter to Senator Fulbright concerning U.S.
support for the Government of South itorea.

He

requC3ted per-

•i•sicn to distribute this in the barracks and around the beeracks.

It was granted with rogard to outside the barracks,

not inside, and he was told that he couldn't argue or debate
while distributing this letter, a11d no reasons were given for
these restrictions.
The fourth exlllllple, which I think epitomizes this
case, Huff a11d Palatine

requested the P'j.rat Marir.:c

Aircraft Wing caimianier to leaf let the base with a. leaflet
entitled, "We Hold These Trutha To Be Self-evident, But
The Brass?"

I

Do

It included the Declnration of Independence, tbe

First Ameniment, and their commentary.

The carnuar.ding officer

Well, do you think the Constitution per-

mits leafletting a base by a membor of the military to the
effect that the commanding officer of this base is lazy, corrupt, and engaged in treascnable conduct, even if those statements might be proven true?
DRANpZKE:

I think that as long as that acti-

vity takes place in a way that does not disrupt tho order of
the base and the discipline of the baeo, that: can be taken care

I understand that last -- if yoa will tell

MR. DRANITZKE:

It is our contention furthermore

that the regulations here and the statute don't mesh the way
they do in Glines, that an individual writing his Congressm:.n
in this case would require command approval before he signs
that letter.
QUESTION:

That would bc directly contrary to the

statute, if you read it that way.

MR. DRANITZKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, that 1s exactly

our posit! n .
Don't you rend regulations

in this case, that this is n combat ready base and you need
such a regulation, that in fact you had a three and a half
year period 1n this case where the government has never come to
court and asked for a stay of the order below, and

I

think

this belies the allegations of the government 1n this case
that national security requires this regulation.
We had a District Court judgein May of '76 decide
that all of the four regulations covering the entire Western

1034, and specifically

Pacific are unconstitutional,

enjoined the entire Iwakuni Air Bnse personnel frol!I requii•ing
prior command approval, and yet the government has never once
come into court and asked for· a st.ay of this decla1•ation or
of this injunction.
Apparently things have E;one on at the ltiakuni Air
Base ,.ithout the i;overnment finding the need to come into
court and say, oh, no we need these regulations.
QUESTION:

I take it your position would also fore-

clo:;e any regulation that r;aid thnt anyone who wants to send
a pctlt1on to his Congressman must first show it to the
co1111 anding officer?

He needn't get any approval of 1.t at all?

Did the government or anybody else eve1•

until and unless permission is refused?

Is it your position

- - does everybody agree that it iu a restriction within the
meaning of 1034 just to require submission?
MR. DRANITZKE:
to

It is certainly our position, that

submission, whether approval or showing, is a re-

striction and that was the whole llasis ot the statute being
passed .

I think that furthermore the military is not without

the ability to promulgate prop<Jr l'egulations regarding time,
place and manner.

thinks are necessary here for purposes of national security.
With regard to Greer v. Spock, it is our position
that that was a constitutionally based opinion in which the
authority of the military to prohibit civilians on base was
basically involved, that what you have here is a case of
military personnel attempting to circulate petitions.
