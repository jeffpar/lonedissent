MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Via will hear arguments

Mr. Carooin, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS G. CAROQM, ESQ.r
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF TEXAS
MR. CAROQMt

Mr. Chief Justise, and may it please the

Courts
This is an original action initiated by the State
of Texas.over six years ago to enforce the Pacos River
Compacte an interstate agreement concerning the distribution
of water on the Pacos River.
For the last four years wo h«.ve been before the
Special Master, the- Honorable Jean S. Fra i tens to in,

During

this time the Master has issued two reports.
The first report; was in July 1911 v his report
on 'New Mexico’s affirmative defessas fc our action.

In that

report h© overruled the*' affirmative 'defenses of lack of
%

justloable controversy,• exhaustion, primary jurisdiction.,

ss toppe 1 and 1 aches-.
Now Mexico has voiced no ob j@ stlon to 'that ruling.
The Master has -filed 'another report, his •«•«*-

QUESTION*

s

W& have never adopted it either, have

we?
MR. CAROOMg

7ou have not adopted it.

It was filed,

4
I believe is th© notation given,,
New Meseies has not in this most recent round of
objections objected to the original report, either,,
Th© current report is tine Master's determination
of New Mexico's obligation under Article 3-A of the Pecos
River Compact,

This ns -the key provision and let me briefly

read it to the Courts
-"New MesdLc© shall not deple'ta by man's
activities the flow of the Pecos livsr at the New
Mesd.co“T©3SEs: State line below an mount which will
give Texas a quantity of water equivalent to that
available under the 194? Condition,"
Now, the Mey phrase here is

’the 1947 Condition"

which is defined by Article 2-G of the Compact,

Article

2»G states8
RTha 194? Condition means thifc situation
in the Pecos River Basin as described and defined
in the report of the Enginesring Advisory Committee,H
It goes

on

t3 says

“In determining any question of fact here­
after arising as bo such situation reference
shall b® made to rod decision shall be based on
such report,w
Noth. the Engineering Advisory Report is a collect­
ion of various reports put together by a committee of

s
engineers that were advising the Compact negotiators prior
to the adoption anti ratification of the Compact.
Texas contones the two Compact provisions I have
read to you must be and war® intended t? be applied literally?
■ ,1.©. the 1947 Condition is exactly what the 'Compact says,,
■ it is that Condition defined in the engineering report»
New*Mexico would go a step further and extrapolate
the definition.
»

New Mexico- would say that because the

: engineering reports were intended to re elect conditions
existing on the river-roughly la 1947, that the 1947
-.-.Condition is hot as - defined by' 'the Compact, it is not that
■ engineering raport but rather those conditions which the
■ report was depicting.
QUESTION!

that again?

New Mexico would say' that the 1947

Condition is not the report and the conditions it is
•'deocrifoing but rather those conditions j t was intending to
describe.

QUESTIONS

Yos..

MR® CAROOM;
QUESTIONS

But the problem here is —
But you would say that even if everybody

conceded the report just made ©a outright* obvious mistake
in describing what the condition on the river was?
MR* CAROOM§

as a lawyer would say that*

Our

Compact Commissioners have not said that»
■ •

QUESTION3

Neither lias the Special Master, I

take it?
MR, CAROOM«
QUESTION §

That is true*
Yes*

MR, CAROOM s

In evaluating the State’s argument —

QUESTION % ’ You say you don't want to fee unreasonable,
I am disturbed about th;:s Special Master’s statement on page
48 of his report»

I quotas

"Tfe® in ferens:. gent attitude of each State over
the many yearn of this controversy suggests" —
Do you agree with that?
MR, CAEOOM2

This Is where the Master is suggest­

ing the Compact won’t work because the states are both
fairly hard headed»
QUESTIONt

I wouldn’t have asked this except that

you said you didn’t wart to fes unreasonable,
MR, CAROOMs

I don't agree with the Master’s

statement that the Comp-act appears to be unworkable or with

his concern»

The Statos have basically bean separated

over th® years by their different constructions of the
term 194? Condition»

Because of this it was impossible for

either of th® States to really coin.promi.3Q their position and
give away water they thought they were entitled to»

I think

once this is all resolved that we will be able to make the
Compact work»
QUESTIONS
MR» CARQOMs

You mean work either way?
If this is resolved in New Mexico's

’ favor, all Texas has to do is attend the meetings once a
year®

W@ can male© that; work»
QUESTIONs

I cm -curious»

Bo fon think the Master's

statement in his report was directed at th© negotiators or
at counsel -or respective governors or to whom was
it
'^

./

-addressed?
MR. CAROOMs

St is directed,

l believe, at the

Pacos River Commission, the representatives from each Stateo
' Xt is directed also, I think «perhaps at th© lawyers in the

case»
If you look it the Master's July 1911 report that
was- accepted by this Courts he initially tried to reach a
■ coi$>romise -and ass-snfcicliy- told -the State*

"I- am going to

withhold rulings on. three of those af£i:cmative defenses
until yon all have gos« back to the Pease River Commission
•and tried to work this but, and I am 'giving you 18 months to

8

do that®
Now, shortly after his report came out there was a.
meeting of the Pecos River Commission and the State had an
opportunity to file objections to that report.

We filed

the objections and he coincidentally received a copy of the
transcript of that meeting.

The combination of the transcript

of the meeting and the objections filed convinced the Master
that it would serve no purpose to remand -the States and
give them this opportunity to work it out,
QUESTIONS

I think there are three positions.

One

is New Mexico, 'one is Texas 'and the other is the Master.
MR. CAROOM;

Yes, and the Master is in the middle.

His decision so far as the theory of what the 1947 Condition
is goes with New Mexico.

It says it is now what the

engineering report says but rather -the conditions the
engineers were trying to depict what was on the river,
QUESTIONS

When you say his position is in the middle

ara you prepared to taka from that he is now recommending
what he had hoped or thought the parties should have agreed
to in a compromise?
MR, CAROOMs

X wou .d hesitate to speculate what the

Master thought we should agree to in a compromise.
simply telling: us to go compromise*

He wag

1 think the Master has

no* -presented us with what ha thinks is s fair compromise.
What he has done is taken New Mexico’s theoretical View to

9

the f4? Condition question but given them less than everything
they were asking for.

He says if it is- going to be natural

conditions on the river wa have to have a date to see when
those actual conditions cut off.

And that date is January

1, 1947,
»

The Master also says ~~
QUESTIONS

That does make quite a difference,

MR, CAROOMs

Sc far as I know we have no evidence

in the record to reflect that,
QUESTIONS

At least New Mexico thinks it makes a

difference,
MR, CAROOM;

New Mexico certainly thinks it makes a

difference,. Your Honor,
The second point that the Master did not go with
New Mexico on is the question of groundwater' depletion.
is a little bit more complex.
a surface water system.

This

The Pecos; River is not simply

There are. groundwater aquifers near

the river which feed the !river and in times past have
significantly contributed to the -flow of the river.

In 1947

New Mexico irrigators ware over-pumping the groundwater
system.

They were drawing water out faster than it would re*"

charge,

Consequently if that 1947 piunping continues you

have a continued declino of the groundwater aquifer and a
continued decrease of the groundwater contribution to the
riverf based upon the pumping existing in 1947,

10

The Master’s ruling said you did not get the
ultimate effect of the 194? pumping in terms of the
depletion»

All you get is the depletion which was reflected

in the river January X. 1947»
So New Mexico’s is contesting those two points»
Wa are contesting the Master’s basic decision»
Nowe 1 think it is clear that, what the Master
was doing was trying tc reach an equitable compromise for a
difficult problem»
■ made his mistake»

I think also that is? where the Master
The .fester’s job in idiis case was not to

work equity»

The Master’s job in this case was to enforce

the Compact»

Equity had been worked, ar equitable apportion»

menfc of the water had bean reached by virtue of the Compact
negotiation process which this Court'hae repeatedly recommended
for that purpose.

His decision to essentially divide the baby

again after the Compact had fairly well pinned the 1947
Condition to that engineering report.

Tie Master is

essentially encouraging Upstream States Involved in interstave compacts now to come in and try for a second bite at
the apple if it is working a hardship upon them».
Let me turn for just a moment -;o the basis for the
Master's decision, the basis he advances in his report»
He says that he is convinced that the 194? Condition
refers to a tangible reality as opposed to a bunch of numbers»
Now, the Masts..* has incorrectly characterised Texas'

II
position insofar as ha ties it to the one page of numbers
appended to his reporfc0

The routing study is considerably

more than that and I have addressed that in our brief,
I believe when the Compact was drafted the
negotiators had a very definite and obvious intent to
eliminate the problem of what was the 1947 Condition and
what was going on in the river in 1947,

They added the

second sentence to the definition which says in solving
any question of fact pertaining to the 194? Condition you
look to the engineering report and the decision is made based
upon that,
Thera is only one other definition in the Compact
that has a second sentence to it like that and that is
Article 2-E which defines deplete by man's activities.

It

states a definition of depletion by man s activities which
essentially makes it the ,8'ame thing as beneficial consumptive
use.

It then has a second sentence which states for purposes

of this Compact it does not include dim: .nation of flow by
encroachment of* a alt calare’ or other like group or by a,-,
deterioration of the channel of the stream.
Now, Tessas in good faith- conic, hot argue that
man's activities included channel deterioration*

Because of

the way a reservoir was' operated, although physically it is
possible to make a connection in terms cf causation this
article clearly prohibita us from making such an argument»

12
Similarly, in terms oil the spread of salt cedars man’s
activities can't encroach that but we could not begin to
advance -that argument.

Yet Article 2-C*s second sentence

makes it equally clear that the 1947 Condition is to be
tied to that engineering report available to the Compact
negotiators upon which the Compact was based.
QUESTION:

What was the Master's response in, his

report to your reliance on the second sentence of the definiti
in 2*»G?
MR. CARQQMs

The Master has not responded to the

second sentence of Art..ole 2-G»

View Mexico lias not responded
i

to the second sentence of Article 2-G.

X have heard no

satisfactory response to that.
QUESTION;

Well, what is your attack on the

Master's report, page 36, where he says;
"Texas contends that the 1947 Condition is
immutably' expressed in the routing study.
Master disagrees.

The

That routing study is no more

than a model of how the river would operate under
various assumptions.
any situation.

It does not describe or define

T2.ua Compact recognises supplementation

’by additional data hereafter accumulated. *65
The master at that portion of his report essentially
advances four reasons for rajacting Texas* position.

The

first, I have addressti briefly, thkt tie routing study

13

doss not define or describe any situation.

The Master

at another portion of his report, says it must refer to a
tangible reality / it can’t be synthetic; imagery.

I think

•the second sentence of Article 2~G is the clear answer to
that* it says it is the report and it is not up to the Master
now to change it.
Now, the second basis the Master criticised —*
QUESTION{

Bat somebody has to be able to under*»

stand the report and ha says the report is full of
mistakes, uncertainties and emissions, by itself,
MR. CAROOMs

He also says in his report that; he

didn’t understand the engineering involved in this and that
he was trying to make
QUESTION i

A id he also indicated that none of the

engineers*—- well, some of the engineers didn’t, too* apparently
They certainly disagreed with each other mightily»
MR. CAROOM3

Thera were serious disagreements

between the engineers ;shout the report.
reflects basically

What the evidence

let raa back up for just a second.

The Master was faced with essentially this question,
the legal interpretation of the 1947 Condition when he mads
his report on affirmative defenses.
it at that time.

We urged him to answer

He s«dd he did not want to decide the case

•'in a factual vacuum, he wanted to hear all about the engineer­
ing questions involved»

So we have over 3,000 pages of

14
transcripts by engineer’s* highly technical testimony,
walking through the routing study of Senate Document 109

that was later done by the Commission called the Review of

QUESTION::

These are- the two exhibits attached

to
MR* CAROOMs

Those are»

It is important to realise these exhibits are
simply summary documents which reflect the routing study
that was done*

They are not the routing study themselves.

Now, the Master docs net make that clear in his report,
/

This is simply the summary,
I have tried fco explain in my brief on a step by
step basis what a routing study is and how it works.

There

is more to it than simply the annual sui-mary,
QUESTIONS

When you say the Compact refers to

the 194? Condition you -say it incorporates the- 1947 statistics
;

•'

i

or the routing study?
MR, CARGO?! s
QUESTION s

sfea, Your Honor,
Net the average which appeal’s below the

1947 but the 1947 itself?
■ MR, CAROOMs

Oh, not that year; no,

Let me back up

arid make tills clear.
What happened in the Compact sagotiations was the

IS

engineering committee performed a number of routing studies
such as the one you are looking at now or each resulted in
summaries like that®

What a routing study is is essentially

taking the natural conditions on the river, the virgin flew
before

there is any development»

And by Ndevelopment?N I

mean irrigation, reservoirs, uses of the water.

Now, using

that virgin condition as & simplistic model the engineers
would then superimpose upon it stages of development of
uses on the river»

So they would impose the reservoirs that

existed in 1947, they would tire irrigation projects that
were being irrigated in 1947, and sc forth»
/

And then for each year they ran. the water down

;

■the river, adding and subtracting for each of these gains
and losses on the river»
QUESTION s

What about the growths of those

salt cedars?
MR» CARQOMs

Under the 1947 Condition they took

•the salt cedar growth which was existing roughly in 1947 and
imposed that, on the river for the historic period»

S© that

the routing study shows looking at the historic period how
much water would have some down the river each year had
those condi biones been existing.
QUESTION^

Well had the same number of salt cedars

existed?
MR» CAROGMs

r©, the salt cedars grew tremendously

16
in the late ’Thirties

md the ’Forties»

But in the routing

study it shows them existing back to ISOS said how much water

would have com® down the river in 1905 with them there»
QUESTIONS

So the number of salt cedars is assumed

to remain constant throughout this period?
MR, CAROGMs

All of the 1947 Conditions that are

imposed upon the river in the routing study are assumed to
remain constant»

They vary according to weather„ how much

rainfall there was that year, how mush water is available.
But those are the conditions imposed in this engineering
study upon the river,
QUESTION s

But' that suggests to me that the Mas ter

is quite right when ho saya the routing study —» the report
doesn’t describe any actual condition,
MR.- CAROOMs
says that,

The Master is quite right when he

2 mean it is not a precise csscr.ipt.ion of what

existed in 1947,

It was not intended te be.

It was intended

to show tha major developments and uses that were existing
at,the time.

And it was thought to accurately depict the

• -performance of the river with things actually on it in 1947.
QUESTION t

Miy I just ask another point of inquiry.

On this rather elaborate chart which I guess we
are talking about Exhibit 8 of tha Mastor’s report there
a*:^ figures for each year from 1905 through 1946,

Do I

correctly understand that in making the calculations say for

1?
1905 <>r 1906 they assuraad that the cedars would have been
those that were in effect 1947 and then extrapolated back
to what the river flow would have bean had that condition
existed.
MR. CARQOMs
QUESTIONS

That is correct.
Arid they did, that for everything that was

present in 1947, they computed bade to a hypothetical set of
'facts for -the earlier years and than did the arithmetic on
what they thought the water would have been?
MR. GAROQMs
QUESTIONS

Tliay did that, precisely.
Why did they do that?

MR» CAROOMs
conditions.

They compared a number of different

The compared for example 1905 conditions*

compared 1915 to 1933 conditions.

They

They took different stages

of development on the Pacos River and tried to see what water
was' available under each of those*
On® of the conditions- they did was called the 1947-A
Condition which was basad upon an offer of Compact made by
New Mexico which showed the groundwater contribution to the
river entirely depleted.

That was another routing study.

There was another routing study4 which showed the groundwater
entirely depleted < md the salt oedars entirely cleared ou:„
QUESTION?

Those were different alternatives that

they studied before they agreed upon- using 1947 as the base
point? is that right?

18

•’MR* CAROQM:
QUESTIONs

TIiat is correct*
May I ask you thiss

Under the Master®s

understanding of the proper definition of 194? Condition what,
f-unction will -this chart play?
MR. CAROOMs

There are two charts.

The first one

•is the 194? Condition routing which, was performed when the
Compact was negotiated.

If Texas' position is adopted,

then this chart indirectly and the studies which underly it
will form .the basis for a standard by which New Mexico's
State line deliveries ere judged*
QUESTION s

I understand that -j\& Texas ® — but I
•

•

am saying that under tbs Master's defini tion what function
will this chart perform?
MR* CAROOMs

Oh, excuse me*

Under the Master's

it just gets 'thrown out,
QUESTIONS

It was just a total useless exercise

under his definition?
MR, CAROOMs

It was entirely discarded, as is the

rest of -the original engineering report.
With the Court's permission I would like to reserve
the rest of my time for rebuttal.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

.Very well, Mr* Caroom*

Mr. Simms, I think you may proceed when you are
ready.

19
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A, SIMMS, ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OB'1 THE DEFENDANT
MR, SIMMS §

Hr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
I would Ills© to respond quickly to your concern,
Mr, Justice Stevens, and try to explain to you just what that
41-column routing study is and its relation to the question
of whether or not the 1947 Condition is real or artificial.
That question appears as Item No, 4-A in 'the
Master's pre-trial order of October 31, 1977» ' Under Item
4-3 of that pre-trial ordSr‘r€here were 11 additional issues
that ware raised, each of which related to whether or not
th® original 1947 Condition study as it appears in Appendix
A in the Special Master’s report should have been corrected
factually and engineeringly.
The first one of those issues related to -th© use
by the -Pecos -River CcsaraissiOn in its res tudy of the condition
•in the 1 Fifties of revised USGS stream flow records.

The

stream flow data that ms' originally available- did not
change but the USGS had determined that it was improperly
reported.

The accuracy of the revised data was not disputed

by the parties.

Well, the errors in the original study show

up most conspicuously in Appendix A in columns 1, column 13,
column 21 and column 35,

Those are the s;olumn@ which ware

designed to describe, in effect, the rainfall

and the snow

20
melt.

To give you an oxaiaple of the magnitude of the

difficulty. New Mexico’s Exhibit No» 3' before the Master
shows that 54 percent of the monthly calculations in column
1 in the original study were significantly in error,,
Well, the net effect of that was to mathematically
put more water in the ; fiver into Stateline

thin would have

gotten there under the 194? Condition for each of the
■

historic years that -they attempted to Tout® water down the
river through that Condition,

ted that Condition is all of

the reservoirs on the stream, three major reservoirs, the
channel losses between the reservoirs, all of the diversion
works and the irrigati >n depletions that actually existed
in the Basin in ’47.
toother of those 4~B issues -that are still back
before the Master relates to column 12 in the routing study
hype.id.ijs A.

That i;

artesian inflow and that relates to

parr of the s-'cudy that attempted to describe channel
gains ©nil losses between Alamogordo Reservoir to the north
.vicMillan Reservoir to "the south,

while the Pecos River

Ccmlssion determined that the original study put about
9,600 acre--feet per year too much into the river resulting
xn. a corresponding State line exaggeration of New Mexico’s
delivery obligation of approximately 4,300 acre-feet.
In ofchf
xs -the

lords, if the- agreement embodies in the Compact
<al Mfr'47 Condition as opposed" tso its first attempted

21
description the use of the erroneous description would
administratively add about 4,800 acre-feet annually to New
Me;d. co' & cb 11 gati on»
Another of those 4-B issues relates to CGluran 10
in Appendix A and that relates to channel loss between
Alamogordo Reservoir tc the north and a gage called Acme»
QUESTIONt
MR* CARGO Ms

Alamogordo is up by Fort Stunner?
That is correcto

The Pecos River Commission in its study in the
’Fifties determined that the original Appendix A study showed
that the losses wars about 16 ,500 acre^iest per year too
small»

Well, -that had the corresponding effect of inflating

New Mastico’s obligation under the Compact»

If you look to

column 16f that relates to salt cedar depletion in a delta
area above McMillan Reservoir»

There tha Pecos River

Commission and the engineer advisors to the Commission
determined that the original study understated the depletion
by 23,900 acre-feet a year.

Just above .bat on .the Exhibit

stipulated Exhibit No» 2 is column .14,
farmers pumping water out of /the river»

That relates to
There the Pecos

River Commission and .the engineer advisors determined that
the original study —» in the original study the wrong
acreage was used and also the wrong depletion rate was used»
That had the mathematical effect of defla.ting column 14 by
about 6,500 acre-feet a year and inflating column.41 at tha

22
State line by a corresponding amount,
QUESTIONS

General Simms, I tnderstand that *»« I

think everyone agrees that had the feme facts been known
and been reflected on the chart here the net effect would
have been favorable to New Mexico rather then Texas, which
I guess is the burden of what you are saying, if they had
not made mistakes in some of their estimates and projections
and ao forth.
But how does 'that meet the argument that the
purpose of the chart was to define -a point of reference
which is specifically referred to in -the Compact?
MR, SIMMSs

The purpose of the routing study was

twofold.

It serves ©no purpose in the administration of the

compact.

There it becomes th© backbone of what is called

the inflow-outflow technique.

In the negotiation period

what they did was finally decide to freeze conditions in
New Mexico as of 1947,

That is all thoroughly explained by

Royce Tipton,
QUESTION'3

But why, for example, did they

extrapolate as to trhat they thought the condition® -ware .in
1905 and 1906, thought those conditions would have been
if th© physical developments that Were In place in 1947 had
been in placa earlier.

Why did they do that?" Why didn’t

they just leave it oper and say lot’s figure these things
out as w© go along.

23

MR» SUMS 3

They did it first of ail because all

of .the engineer advisors thought it. would be unwise to
predicate this Compact on what is called a schedule, that
is, you know, so much water coming in up here that means that
so much water has got to go out here»
down ahd you enter an agreement.’

7ou simply right that

The hydrology of the
:

river is too complicated largely because of all of the
phreatophytos on the river and the difficulty they were
having' there, which 'we will discuss in n moment.
What they did was use the Condition as a way of
freesing-development in the State of New Mexico and then
they ran that Condition of frozen development through year
historically between 1933 through 1946 vhan they ran out of
data,at th© time and attempted to assess by doing that how
the river would'have behaved historically given the existence
of the ’ 4? Condition,

.it was that real live Condition on
t

the stream that they wanted to look, at and they wanted to
get some idea of how fcho river would 'behave in future
years.
QUESTION £

Looking backward thay felt would give

them some added capacity to predict as ta the future behavior?
MR. SIMMS'*

That is correct.

But importantly though.-the nature of th© agreement
was not the first routing ^tudy that described it but rather
the Condition that described the frozen conditions aa of 1947.

24

Roycs Tipton was the engineering advisor to the Federal
representative during the negotiationss

That is precisely

the way in which he explained the final compromise in the
litigation,,
What the Pecos River did though, it started out
and had difficulty trying to make the Compact work, in effect.
«There was a large difficulty with what is called the inflowoutflow manual which is an administrative tool used to
angineeringly arrive at: inflows for administrative years
and then to come back i:nd plug them ints a curve that was
created as a result of fcha 41-column sfcidy.
Before we take the exhibit out let me point out
one. area on the map ant that is between Roswell and Artesia.
You will notice there an area shaded in green.

That area

is supported by groundwater pumping that has a lot to do
with the second half of this case and that is -tlie problem
of base flew diminution and the difficulties with water
salvage.
QUESTION t

Is it correct that tills Exhibit 8 of

fcha Master's report is

2

part of the report of the Engineering

Advisory Committee?
MR. SIMMSj

It is.

And I was going to go straight

to your question 'about Article 2-6.
•

QUESTION8 • Right.

I want to know what your view of

the significance of the second sentence in the article is

25
and I don’t find the Mister as satisfactorily explaining
that.

CcnmiitteeB shows that the 194? Condition is just the name
of that routing study.
defines the report.
study.

That is not true.

Article 2«G

It is much more than that routing

Indeed, the first statement in the report of the

Engineering Advisory Coamlttae about the

1947 Condition is,

eind I am quoting;
*Tho 19*4? Condition is all actual present
conditions on the river.85
That statement was made on January 14, 1948.

26
Article 2-F defines the breadth of the report»
It is mush more than Appendix A,

It says?

'’The 1943 report of the Engineering Advisory
Committee include!

that report,, the appendices

thereto'/ the basic* data and processes and analyses
used in preparing it, all of which were reviewed*
adopted and approved as shown in tae minutes of the
meeting of December 3* 1948."
There Royas Tipton explained this Compact to the
negotiators and to the Commissioners.

Mach provision of

the Pecos River Compact was explicitly adopted subject to
his explanation.

In explaining Article 2-G he said the

194? Condition relates to a condition on the stream.

There

were certain conditions of the river such as the diversionary
requirement® of the

Carlsbad project, the salt cedar

consumption, the reservoir capacities that existed in 1947,
the operation of the Port Sumner project, up to 6,500 acres
mid the operation of all other projects on the stream as
•they actually- existed -in 1947.
I don * t think there 1b a clearar statement -that
the 194? Condition as envisaged by the engineer advisors
and the Commis®loner® who finally signed the Compact was

&

ir.ioed the reality out the stream.
Perhaps the meat compelling bit of evidence that
should persuade' the Court that New Mexico’s view of the 1947

21
Condition and the Master’s view of the 1S47 Condition is
correct is the fact that the Pecos River Commissioners„ all
of -die engineer advisors involved in fcha negotiation of the
Compact 'themselves sought fed correct that description before
they personally believed that they should do any administra­
tion under the Compact»
I would point out that the people that corrected
it, the deadwood is called the review o? basic data and ended
up with what is shown as Appendix R in she" Master’s report
a second description of the- 1947 Condit;,on.

Those were the

sans actors working or, the Commission — • working for the
Feedso River Commission in the 1 Fifties as were there
negotiating and adopting the Compact in 1949c
Well, the legal side of this enaction relates to
the power of the Pecos River Commission to make the corrections
it actually made.

We feel that that is answered clearly and

conclusively by Article 6-C of the Compact and that reads s
"Unless and it,til a more feasible method is
devised and adopted by the Commission 'the inflowoutflow method as described in the report of the
Engineering Advisory Committee shall be used to
determine the effect on the State line flow of
any change .in depletion by man’s activities

or other­

wise»*
When Mr. Tipton talked of that article he said

23
the way the Pecos Compact is written the Commission has full
authority to change the method or perfect the technique so
long as what is dons by the Commission is something directed
at the determination under Article 3-A.

To avoid or to

obviate the significance of Article 6~C, what Texas tries
to do is draw- a distinction between the routing study as it
is used administratively in the Compact and what is called
the inflow-outflow technique of administration„
Well, you can’t do that.

The. only utility of that

routing study in the actual administratlor of the Compact
is to construct an inflow-outflow plate, a plate that you
can

in administrative years you go cut on the river,

you gather up inflow data for three'years running, you go
back to this plate and plug into the inflow aide of the
plate and you coma out with an indicated outflow that should
define Mew Mexico’s obligation.

Well,

the routing study

for administrative purposes is as integral a part of the
technique as is the gathering of data during administrative
years.

-Indeed', it is the very backbones of the inflow-outflow

method.
Wall, if you throw out the in clow-outflow method
as the Commission is expressly authorised to do by Article
6-C you throw out -the' whole inflow-outflow manual.

You also

'throw out Plate 2 -and you also throw out the routing study,
at least for administrative purposes•

29
What you are left with is the 194? Condition on
the stream which is precisely the same condition 'that the

Well, the admiaisi-r.atlwi history' we think is claar»
Tok via tries to 'distinguish'. Womehbw between what happened

Also to agree with' Tekas* objection 1» this regard
would be to- condona the attempted unilate ral repudiation of

I believe this Court'- has consistently

mru i-'c has consistently voided ‘any unilats'ral State action
designed to define obligation's under- Compact,

He never made a motion before the

Commission and certainly no effort was- made to revoke the
Compact pursuant to Article 14 of its terms by seeking the
State’s revocation of their ratification.
• Tessas has argued we believe wrongly on th© law
that well, both Statas are simply stuck for the'study.

1

would point out another error in the inflow--outflow manual
that if

xm

were, studs with, as - the Mas tar has ruled, that

needs to be corrected as well*

If we ware stuck with that,

it would by Texas* own analysis coat the:m 42,000 acre-*feet
per year.
I think the answer to the fact that we area*t
stuck with the study derives simply from the fact that the
194? Condition is not what you sea in Appendix A.
Well, the other half of this case relates to
base flow diminution and the problem of water salvage.

And

\

I chink that is really why we are hare.

We aren’t here

because there has been a bunch of gluttonous development in
Mew Mexico since 1947,

?e aren’t here because of changes in

depletions in New Mexico sine© 1947.

We are here because

of the failure to offset anticipated declines in -the flow
of the river by water salvage.

32
Toward the end of Compact negotiations the
engineer advisors advised the Commissioners of two facts,,
essentially# that in tie McMillan Delta above that reservoir
was a huge floodway of phreafcophytes, pareafcophytes that
were non-boneficially consuming about 3:3,000 acre-feet of
water each year»

They knew that there was some likelihood

of salvaging water from that ratification»
On 'the other hand, they knew 'hat the pumping in
the area that I showed you on the map, the area between
Roswell and Artesia, if continued at the depletion rate of
/

1947 would ultimately decrease the base flow of the river
just below there approx:.mately 40,000 acre-feet a year»
Well, what they attempted to eo was come up with
a mechanism, a remedial mechanism to keep the river whole
over time»
Kail, the re a.

reason we are here today is because

there has not bean effected any water salvage, and that is
tha problem»

The whole scheme was to mate it so that

according to Article 1 of the Compact we could maintain the
uses not just, in New Mexico but in both States»
Our objection to the Master® s report in this regard
goes to his failure, in >ur view, to really appreciate the
issue»

He did not weigh in the balance the water salvage

provisions on the one hand and the base flow diminution problem

on the other hand

33

Iu responsa ;o our objections* before hia in that
regard ha said that salvage has nothing to do with the
194? Condition»

Well; quite the contraryr Article 3-A says

.that New Mexico shall not deplete the Hot-? of the Pesos
River at the Stats line below an amount, which will give to
Texas a quantity of water equivalent to that available under
■the 1947 Condition,
■ Now, it is that concept of equivalence that
•'facilitates the substitution of source of supply in New
Mexico as base flow declines with watez salvaged.

The

intent again was to keep the river whole ever time and the
Compact, as I say, is essentially remedial in nature.
The question of what happens when salvage is not
effected to offset that base flow diminution is not addressed
by the Compact*

There is testimony on it by John Erickson,

He was asked the question of what happened and he said,
"I don’t think they ever considered it.

If the Compact worked

as anticipated, you wouldn’t get to the -problem,®
•

Wall, all you can do is look to the salvage

provisions of the Compact,
cooperative salvage,

They mandata in Article 4

then Mr, Tipton explained the Compact

•he said that the Compact by its terms mandates salvage in
order to make, it work.
Also 2 would point out that tie record shows that
the New Mexico legislatura would not have ratified the

34

Compact if that burden. is not shared,

The alternative would

have basis an immediate and very drastic cutback in irrigated
acreage in New Massico,
While Texas has referred to our construction of
the Compact as ludicrous in saying that it removes salvage
from the realm of possibility, well, thr.t was precisely the
design of the Compact over time, 40 years from when the
Compact was ratified, that is exactly what they contemplated,
they would hav® 'salvaged enough water from eradicating
■ phreadophytas to offset 'Idle base flew diminution*

And from

tfr&t point on everybody would have lived happily ever after*
Well, the consequences unfortunately are that both States
are suffering*

Texas ir not bearing this burden alone.

There has bean a drastic water shortage In the State of New
■ Mexico and continues to be*

Shortage ie a fact -that crosses

the State line and I think obviously transcends ‘the
sovereignty that generated this- litigation.
Finally, there is one other matter in issue, one;
other matter to which we objected, sad that is the Master*s
conclusion that the 1947 Condition though albeit reality
should have ended December 31, 1946»
as a supposition*

We31, he readied that

as said because in the original study

they only used the period 1905 to 1946 the engineers must
have intended to exclude th© year- 1947»

'/fell, in this

regard we would ilka to rely on our'briefs but I do want to

35
respond very quickly to six items in Texas5 reply brief»
First.# Texas argues that phrases like 53in 1947s
and "during -1947“ were simply loose refe rences or convenient
shorthand»

Well# they are'very anomalous loose references

and convenient shorthand»
J.

On the contrary# if they wanted

'

a 1946 Condition they would have so named it®
_, ■ Texas also states that there is no evidence in the
record to support the fact that the IS46 photographs that
we talked about were interpolated against 1946 photographs
to better ascertain the 1947 Condition»

Texas argues aside

from the accusation that they were really after salt- cedar
acreage and salt cedar acreage alone»

Well# the fact of

the existence of the photographs to which we referred .you
will find in. stipulated Exhibit No. 4 and the fact that they
were interpolating to da famine .irrigatica in 1947 as well
as Silt cedar acreage you will find in stipulated Exhibit
No® 6 both of them» ;
QUESTION s

Do you think the * 47 Condition referred

to ’a certain day?
MHo 'SIMMS s ' It did not refer to a -certain day but
viae engineer- advisors and ’the Commission Itself in doing the
review of basic data used all of the '47 Condition «- or I
mean all of the 1947 data that actually became available
when they did the final review —»
QUESTION»

So you think it is December 31 —

36
MR. SIMMSg
QUESTION:
MR. SIMMS:

That is right.

They used data —

— * 47?
Not through the water year.

Well*

they themselves used data in the calendar year 1947»

That

has to tell you that IS47 was indeed a part of the 1947
Conditi, on.
If yon will look —
QUESTION3

If you took the view that it is an

artificial condition as defined in the report, the date
really is immaterial.
MR* SIMMS s
QUESTION i

I am sorry , I did not hear the question.
I im sorry.

I say if on© took your opponent’s view that the
condition is that defined by the report and the exhibits,
then it doesn’t really matter what the date is.
MR. SIMMS:
QUESTIONS

MR* SIMMS:

That is correct*
Yee.

Then all the error.!, the erroneous

description and everything else as it were is the Compact.
The parties to the Compact themselves ho?raver did not have
that view, as their actions we think unequivocally demonstrate*
Texes also say s that in Plates 5 through 10 in the
inflow-outflow manual firs inclusion of If47 data was
insignificant.

Well,- those plates were reach by reach

inflow-outflow routing studies to determine the 19 47 Condition.

3?
They did indeed include the year 1947 in -those individual
curveso

If they did not want the year 1947 to be a part

of the base line curve against which yot would later make
administrative determinati,©ns there is no reason, why you
would have included that data except to conclude that the
year * 47 is a part of it.
Also in the review ©£ basic date itself undertaken
'over a number ©£ years Texas simply says tee review of basic
data on this point is dubious.

alio

Well, it is not dubious at

It shows the contemporaneous under standing of tee

parties.

They are the came actors involved in all of this,

the entire review was orchestrated by Royee Tipton who was
an; internationally famous hydrologist and tee advisor to
the Federal representative on this Committsion.
Texas makes a fifth point saying that well, tee
first administrative years t the first administrative
determinations were done through the three-year period 1947
to 1949.

Well, th© simple answer to that is the Pecos

River Commission later determined that tfcey should not have
done teat.
One final point, Your Honors, New Mexico•tendered
evidence • on this subject and the 14« .ater concluded teat that
evidence wcs speculative.

Our witness was John Erickson.

Mew Mexico* a advisorrengineering advisor to the negotiating
Cooniscicn.

He said the simple reason th.sy didn't use it

38
then was because they didn’t have it»

'if -they did have it

they would have used ita
We would suggest quits the contrary, -that it was
the Master’s supposition that it was speculative and not at
all with John Erickson whose testimony the Master described
■as speculativeo

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS G. CAROOM, ESQ.,

Let me initially touch upon a point Mr. Simms has
recently made laying that the players in -the review of basic
data, the people who conducted the reatuiy of the 194?
Condition routing study were the negotiators, the same
people who did the Compact and that this has some special
significance*

That is simply wrong.

The players up until

How, in my brief I go through

But what we have basically is a

document called the in flow-out flow manual

that gives you

directions for figuring cut each year whether or not Hew
Mexico has complied with their obligatior.
has sane mistakes in it.

That document

St wasn’t even drafted and

available until after the Compact was signed.

How, that

3S
document, 'the in flow»?>ut flow manual caused problema in
the early administration of the Compacto

tod the engineers,

the saisa ones who worked, on the Compact, participated in

&n effort to review that document and to rewrite it and
conduct an accounting «s it should have been done under the
original report®

That was done by a subcommittee of the

Engineers Committee in 2.957*

It showed New Mexico 128,000

acre-feet behind in deliveries and it wus turned down by the
Engineering Advisory Cesmittee*
-

Now, it was turned down because -the New Mexico

from 157 to *60 was so far as New Mexico was concerned
.idtir^eted by that same State-' engineer*

The Texas engineer

who had worked oh the original studies did not participate
in it and -in fact he died mid-way througi it©
QUESTION $

I take' it" that the Special Master was-

raware of -these factors*

Perhaps ha didn't give them the

significance5, you think they deserved*

But he was aware of

all of them?

MR. C&ROOMs

Ha was.

I think the key to 'the Special Mas ter *s treatment

40

of the engineering report is to his own admission very
forthrightly in his report that ha doasa* t understand this»
He says this is a legal question, I am going to rely on ray
technical assistant' to solve -the engineering questions,

I

aia treating this as a legal question.
But in spite of that it appears that a major
factor in the Master's decision was his perception that
scats thing was wrong with the original report.

Now, we had

a witness, Frank Dowell, who was head ©:: USGS in the Western
Uni.feed States, or assistant head, who testified ha
independently reviewed it. it was a good study, it was
workable, it was checked by the engineers who did it at the
fcir.-.a and it looked good.

It was independently checked by-

Mr, Bell subsequently when he was retained by the State of
Texas and he was convinced it was a sound, workable study,
The subsequent engineering study has more bells
than whistles, it is fancier, the engineers think it is ©
better product.

But it is definitely biased; it is definitely

biased to reducta deliveries to New Mexico,
How, let ass respond briefly,

Mr, Simms attempted

to give en explanation for the second sentence of Article
2-6,

He said the Engineer Advisors Cornsdttee report includes?

more than the

routing ;-study,

Now, this ic discussed at

© little bit of length in my brief- but the only part of
the Engineer Advisor» report that defines the 194? Condition.

41

Is the routing study,

There is the inflow-outflow manual

that was adopted after the Compact,
QUESTION:

That by 'the way is the only matter

attached to the Master's report that has any 1947 data in
it.

The routing study doesn't have any *47 data in it, does

it?
MR, CAROOM:

There are two documents attached to

the Master’s report,
QUESTION;
MR, CAROOM?

Yes-,
Ths first is the summary of operations

under the original river routing study by 'die engineers in
1948,

The second document which is attached to his report

is the counterpart of that exhibit which was produced by
the review of basic data in 1960 or *61»
QUESTION:

Yes,

The Master says that none of the river routing
studies presented to the Compact negotiators covered 1947
data,
MR, CAROOMs
QUESTION:

That is correct,
And that is primarily why he chose the

first of the year?
MR, CAROOMs

That is correct.

That data was not

available to them when they did it and none of the studies
have any * 46 data
QUESTIONS

whatsoever.
i&Lerht

MR, CAROOMs

And the condition was -'agreed upon

without it.
Let ms make one other brief point®

Mr* Simms said

this in flow-oufc flow manual cannot be separated from the
routing study and he apparently sold Judge Breitenstein on
•this idea®

And it is just flat wrong*

The in flow-cut flow

manual is an instruction manual that tells you how to do the
annual computation* • It tells you what 'die steps are to
use the 194? Condition routing study and compare the annual
deliveries on. the river to see if there has been compliance*
The in flow-out flow manual has errors :.n it, it left out
part of the water coming in below, the Alamogordo Reservoir
down to Acmes it just flat left out that part*

It was a

mistake and it'mada other mistakes*
But the standard is there in the routing study
without the in flow-out flow manual*
Thank you*
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*
The case is submitted.

Thank you# gentlemen.
