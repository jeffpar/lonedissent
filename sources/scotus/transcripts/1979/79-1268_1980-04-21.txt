MR; CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The Court will hear

arguments first this morning In 79-1268, Harris v. McRae.
Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever
you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. MeCREE, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MeCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At the cutset it might be helpful to state what
this appeal concerns and what it does not concern.

At

page 291 of its opinion, the District Court said the in­
quiry here Is not what is wise policy but whether the
Congress has or has not adopted a policy which, wise or
unwise, the lav;' forbids.
We submit that this- is the proper approach to
the c\re and that the voluminous evidence in the precedirv 290 pages of the opinion would be useful in forming
c - ’ informing <: legislative judge but not especially help9 9

v.i m we address the constitutionality of the Hyde

arr on dmen t.
We regard the issues as two:
Hyde amendment violates the

First, whether the

equal protection component of

the due process clause by authorizing federal funds for
medically necessary services generally and for abortions

4
only when the life of the mother would he endangered if
the fetus were carried to term but not for other- medically
necessary abortions,; and, second, whether by restricting
the availability of federal funds for medical! necessary
abortions the Hyde amendment deprives pregnant women of
the liberty protected by the due process clause of the
Fifth Amendment or the religious freedom protected by the
free exercise clause of the First Amendment.
Title 19 of the Social Security Act, commonly
called the Medicaid Act, is a cooperative program under
which the federalrgovernment provides financial assistance
to the states that choose to reimburse the categorically
need and optionally the medically needy for the costs of
medical services in at least five categories.

These cate­

gories are in-patient hospital services, out-patient
hospital services, other- laboratory and x-ray services,
skilled nursing services, periodic screening and diagnostic
services, children and family planning and physician,
services.
The act does not expressly require participat­
ing states to pay for abortions or for any other specified
medical procedures.

The Hyde amendment comes into the

picture in this fashion:

In December 1977, in a joint

resolution providing appropriations for the Department

ox

Health, Education, and halfare for the last ten months of

5
fiscal year 1978, Congress modified an earlier version of
the Hyde amendment to include these exceptions to the
general prohibition against abortions*

necessary medical

procedure for victims of incest and rape -— excuse me, I
have misstated myself.

I would like leave to say that

initially, in September 1976, Congress, by the so-called
Hyde amendment, limited the availability of funds to reim­
burse the costs of medically indicated or therapeutic
abortions by providing that none of the funds contained
in the act should be used to perform abortions except
when the life of the mother would be endangered by carry­
ing the fetus to term.
This original Hyde amendment has been subsequent­
ly amended.

It has been amended to add a second exception

to the one where the mother’s life would be endangered by
c:.-r.rying the fetus to term, where necessary medical proceduros

’or victims of incest and rape promptly reported

are included, and where severe and long-lasting physical
health damage to the mother would result if the pregnancy
were carried to term as so determined by two physicians.
These revised versions have appeared in subse­
quent appropriations and the current form of the Hyde
amendment now consists of just the first two, where the
life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were
carried to term or in the case of victims of incest or

6
rape when promptly reported.
The plaintiffs in these cases filed a complaint
in 1976, the day on which the initial version of the Hyde
amendment was adopted.

Cora McRae, the named plaintiff,

a medicaid recipient, was In the first trimester of her
pregnancy, wished to have an abortion.

She did not

allege that the procedure was medically necessary or that
continuation of her pregnancy would, endanger her life,
The court entered a preliminary injunction,
requiring the Secretary to fund all abortions, but then
this Court decided the ease of Maher v. Roe which pro­
vided in essence that the equal protection component
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that case was not
violated by excluding non-therapeutic or elective •abor­
tions from federal funding.

This case then was sent back

to the District Court to consider in the light of the
Court’s opinion in Maher v. Roe and the court took testi­
mony over a period of 13 months and finally in January of
if-is year decided that the discrimination between medic[ J ly necessary abortions and other medically necessary

pro-1.'dure/, violated the equal protection component of the
due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and that it
further violated the protection accorded pregnant women
by the liberty implicit in the Fifth Amendment, in the
due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and in the free

exercise clause of the First Amendment.
It also said in a passage which is not exactly
clear co us that it violated the rights of juveniles be­
cause they were the persons who had the greatest occasion
tc request abortions to terminate their pregnancy.
QUESTION:

That passage in the District Court's

opinion was an aspect of its holding with respect to the
equal protection component of the Firth Amendment, was it
not?
MR. McCREE:
Justice Stewart.

This is my understanding, Mr.

This class was viewed as the ss pact

class and *—
QUESTION:

Right, because of another federal

statute»
MR. McCREE:

Because they are under the

Adolescent Health Services and Pregnancy Prevention and
Care Act and he found that their equal protection rights
were offended by the statute.
Our argument is essentially as follows:

We con­

tend that the Hyde amendment is rationally related to the
legitimate governmental interests in preserving potential
human life and encouraging child birth»

We submit that

the first approach is to determine the proper test to apply.
¥e suggest that in Maher this Court made it clear
that the proper test Was the rational relationship test.

8
In that case., which of course involved non-therapeutic or
elective abortions, the Court held that it was sufficient
if the Congress had a legitimate objective and if the
measure was rationally related to it, and in that case it
found that its interests in preserving potential human
life and encouraging child birth was an appropriate rela­
tionship and it upheld the challenge under the Fourteenth
Amendment.
We suggest here, where the classification is
between medically necessary procedures generally and
medically necessary abortions except those specified,
that the same test should be applied and that the same
governmental interests in preserving potential human life

and encouraging child birth is a legitimate governmental
goal rationally related to the refusal to fund generally
medically necessary abortions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, there is

another interest Involved though on the woman's side,
isn’t there, that wasn’t in Maher?
MR. McCREE:

There is another, yes, if the

Court please, there is another interest.

There is the

medical necessity ~QUESTION:

The life and health interest of the

mother.
MR. McCREE:

A life and health interest but not

o
of the degree specified in the Hyde amendment.
QUESTION:

Right, exactly, but different from

Maher?
MR. McCREE:

Different from Maher in that re­

spect, but we suggest that not different in the sense that
it should require a different analysis.

We still think

that in this area of conferring a benefit, not a prohibi­
tion, not the imposition of a penalty, that the rational
relationship standard should apply,
QUESTION:

Did the District Court agree with

you?
MR. McCREE:

The District Court agrees with us.

We are certain of that in every respect except possibly
the respect relating to the teenagers, and in that respect
it may not.

But the —

QUESTION:

That is where Maher basically dif-

»ferect from Roe, wasn’t it, is that Roe v. Wade was not
discussing the funding by federal or state of abortions
vut simply the right of the woman to consult with her
. hysloi in and make the decision as to whether tp-'b£ve the
abortion without restricted state prohibitions on the
physician’s right to give advice or the mother’s right to
heed the advice: where Maher was dealing with funding.
MR. McCREE:
of the difference.

That is exactly my understanding

Roe was concerned with the state’s

10
prohibition of the woman's right in consultation with her
physician to have an abortion»
QUESTION:

More specifically, it was concerned

with state law that made it a serious criminal offense.
MR. McCREE:

A serious criminal offense, and we

say that the difference in Maher is, looking at a benefit
conferred in the nature of public funding, the Court
found that a different analysis was appropriate and
reached a different result.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, would you

make the same rational basis argument if the Hyde amend­
ment did not contain the exception for endangering the
life of the mother, if it was her death rather than
adverse impact on her health that was involved?
MR. McCREE:

I think I would.

I think I would

say that you would make the rational relation — you
would still apply the same formula because you are talking;
about bestowing a benefit,

It doesn't, prevent this woman

from obtaining an abortion, it just denies her federal
funding for that purpose and the —QUESTION;

Don't we have to assume for purpoes

of analysis at least that some women will be denied abor­
tion;; if they don't receive federal funding?

I thought

that was the thrust of the District Court's finding.
MR; McCREE:

Oh, I think we have to.

I don’t

think there is any question about that.
QUESTION;

And then we therefore must also as­

sume that some of those women will suffer serious medical
harm.
MR. McCREE:

I think that is a judgment that is

—- we must assume that and I think that is a judgment
that the Congress must make.

The Congress in the first

instance did not have to appropriate money to reimburse
any medical services whatsoever.

And .just because Roe-

said that the state could not punish a person under its
criminal laws for obtaining an abortion in the first
trimester and the other refinements, that still did not
obligate the state or the federal government to reimburse
her for the services.

And we think this is the kind of

discretion that is vested in the Congress, to decide

vf. at to do in this — we are speaking about a unique
phenome ion.

This :1s the only — a pregnant woman is the

only person seeking reimbursement for medical services
in a situation where potential human life is involved.
It is unique and we say that the Congress has the right
to make that determination.
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

But it must have a reason, I take it,
It must have a reason and we think

that —
QUESTION:

But if it has a reason, any rational

12
basis, that ends the role of the Court.
MR. McCRSE:

I think if the Court finds that —

well, let’s say a legitimate reason —
QUESTION:

Regardless of what the interests on

the other side are, under the rational relationship test,
I take It you argue that there is no balance involved at
all, it is just if there is a rational basis, that is the
end of it.
MR. McCRSE:

That's the approach in Maher and

that is the way we read Maher.
QUESTION:

The —

Mr, Solicitor General, the Hyde

amendment does not prevent a state choosing itself to
fund abortions, does it?
MR. McCREE:

It does not at all, nor does the

medicaid act generally.

The medicaid act provides fund­

ing for certain kinds of services but it does not restrict
the

rtate from using its judgment to extend the funding

to other areas — its funding to other areas where there
will be no federal reimbursement.
QUESTION:

Do you -'know how many states do in

fact fund abortions?
MR. MeCREE:

I can tell you with reference to

the

abortions and that is a state, of course, from which this
plaintiff, Cora McRae, comes»
QUESTION:

I think I read somewhere —

MR. MeCREE:
QUESTION •

Michigan does, several do.
I think. I read somewhere that there

are ten or twelve that do.
MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:

That's my recollection, but -Any may choose to do so?

MR. McCRSE:

Any may choose to do so, and New

York has never ceased to fund abortions, according to my
information.

In the appellees' brief, there are two or

three references to the states that do, and I could find
it without too much difficulty, I am certain,
QUESTION:

Judge McCree, one senses without

being able to perhaps point to the exact language that
the equal protection clause deprives the federal govern­
ment of the right to or the authority to effect in any
way the woman's decision whether to have a medically
necessary or medically recommended abortion or whether to
carry her pregnancy to term.

If my recollection serves

me, Canada at one time — I don't know whether it still
does or- not — simply paid $1,000 to every family to
which a child was born.

If I am right in thinking that

the District Court rested its analysis on what I think

14
it did5 does that mean the government couldn't give $1,00.0
to every mother who brought a new life into the world un­
less the government also paid $1,000 to every woman who
had a medically necessary abortion?
MR. MeCEEE:

I would find no offense to the

equal protection clause of such a program.

Indeed, it

costs more to bring a — to afford a pregnant woman pre­
natal, obstetrical and postpartum care than it does to
perform an abortion, so in a sense —
QUESTION:

So the government concedes this?

MR. McOREE:

The government concedes this, and

this is set forth in appellees’ brief and. I think we con­
cede it in our brief, too, and I don't think there is any
question —~
QUESTION:

This hasn’t always been conceded,

you know, and I wanted to be sure.
MR. McCREE:
that.

I make a frank concession about

According to the evidence in this case, it costs

more to give a pregnant woman pre-natal, obstetrical,
postpartum services than it does to abort, certainly in
the first trimester if there are no complications.
QUESTION:

And that was the finding in the

companion case, too, I take it?
MR. McCREE:
my understanding.

I-n the companion case, this is

But —

15
QUESTION:

And the rationale of Maher was In

effect that the government can prefer the producing of new
lives to the financing of abortions as a legitimate inter­
est without regard to cost?
MR. McCREE:

Yes, it can and this iss of course,

what we asserted as the essence of our argument on the
equal protection
QUESTION:

General, in the Maher case , the

Connecticut Attorney General, as I remember the argument,
acknowledged that the case would be different if they did
not fund medically necessary abortions.

So this Is a

different issue than that case, wouldn't you agree with
that much?
MR. McCREE:

I think it acknowledges that it

might be different.
QUESTION:
he said.

It might be, I guess that is what

abort ions, didn!t they?

MR. McCREE;

And there is a difference.

You say the analysis should be the

same?
MR. McCREE:

.The analysis should be the same.

As I suggested, we begin with the proposition that the
state doesn't have to fund a right that a person has to

The state doesn't have to do that.

I suspect the state could exclude It*

— mental, illness, institutional­

it can’t do that consistent with the equal protection
component of the Fifth Amendment.
Addressing the other grounds for the District
Court’s opinion, the District Court seems to say that
since some women as a. matter of their religious convic­
tions or conscience would seek an abortion, that to re­
fuse funding for them would somehow deny their First
Amendment right to freedom of religion and free exercise
of religion.
We have a great deal of difficulty with that
because it would seem that the free exercise clause

pi^esents Interference with but doesn’t obligate the state
to finance it. and we suggest In our brief that a person
who has no right to expect the state to furnish him with
religious objects, for example, a bible or any religious
artifacts to enable him freely to exercise his religion.
But this seems to be the thrust of that aspect of the
.oplion and we think that this is a sufficient answer to
that.

MR„ McCREE:

And that is why you omit it?
And that is why we omitted it.

It was a deliberate omission.
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

It was, you say?
It was a deliberate omission,

because we felt it was not significant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, is it not

correct though that there are two kinds of medical prob­
lems that may make medical necessity the reason for —
if we didn’t have the Hyde amendment, might justify
funding the abortion?

One would be harm to the mother,

and the other I suppose would be potential harm to the
newborn child.

Isn’t there sometimes a finding of

medical necessity that can be based on a prediction that
some health problem will affect the child, isn’t fhattrue?
MR. McCREE:

Well, I think there is no question

20
about it.
QUESTION:

Then is there the same state interest

in encouraging that kind of birth as in encouraging the
kind of birth that was involved in Maher?
MR. McCREE:

I think there might not be* and

what you are doing is putting content into the word, "normal
and I agree»
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

The word the Court used in that ease»
Yes, and I agree that there is that

difference and I agree with the Court's suggestion.
QUESTION:

Well, didn't the District Court

indicate that there may be some medically necessary abor­
tions because you couldn't have a normal childbirth?
MR. McCREE:

I believe that is correct, if the

Court please.
QUESTION:

And yet you don't think it is sig­

nificant?
MR. McCREE:

Well, I believe that — yes, I be­

lieve in that sense it is significant, I have to concede.
QUESTION:

Well, I get back, I don’t understand

quite why you omitted "normal” from your statement of what
tho policy is.
MR, McCREE:

Well, we still think that the

Congress has to make that judgment.

have to fund medical procedures even where there might be

MR. McCREE:

Yes.

state interest in the interest in preserving potential

potential human life and we suggest that this alone is
sufficient reason.

Very well, Mr.

Solicitor General,
MR. McCREE:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Miss Copelon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RHONDA COPELON, ESQ, ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MISS COPELON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is one of simple principle and
singular magnitude.

It involves the survival and the

health of potentially millions of poor women in this
country, and it involves reaffirmation of the simple
rule of law of the written. Constitution that this Court
recognized in Roe v. Wade.
I'; is very basic that, as the Solicitor General
says, this case arises in the context of a medicaid pro­
gram designed to provide a broad range of medically

23
necessary and essential services to poor- people throughout
the country,

And it is very significant, as the Solicitor

General agrees, that it is comprehensive and that tut for
the Hyde amendment it would cover abortions as a mandatory
medically necessary service.
Does

the Hyde amendment single out one medically

necessary service?

They preclude the exercise of sound

medical judgment about the health of a pregnant woman or
indeed even of the fetal life-

They prefer fetal 'life at

the expense of maternal health and even maternal life,
If the District Court found the Hyde amendment
repugnant to the entire scheme of the medicaid statute,
they are also repugnant to the most minimal safeguards of
the Constifeution,
QUESTION:

What do you say is the higher scheme

of the Hyde amendment?

Don't we have to take the enacted

will of Congress as a whole, that medicaid plus the Hyde
amendment is the enacted will of Congress?
j
MISS COPSLON: Your Honor, we do but we have to
consider whether the singling out of the one service ot
abortion in the context of an intent to provide medically
necessary services is rational and —
QUESTION:

But the intent of Congress was to

provide medically necessary services with the exception of
abortion except in certain circumstances -

24
MISS CQPELON:
QUESTION:

That * s right, Mr, Justice Stewart.

That Is the thrust of my brother's

question.
MISS COFELON:

And the constitutional question

that is presented to this Court and the one we will discuss
today is simply whether under the minimal standard of
rationality in the equal protection component of the Fifth
Amendment the Congress can single out that one service»
QUESTION:

But then, you must be arguing not that

it doesn't serve a legitimate or- rational state Interest,
because presumably virtually any act of Congress will do
that if applied —- if rational scrutiny is applied.

You

have to say that one purpose of Congress conflicts with
another, which is almost incomprehensible to me.
MISS COFELON:

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, our

argument is that in the context of this scheme and also,
and more importantly, in the context of the equal protec­
tion the preference for fetal life at the expense of
m ier.al health and maternal life is Irrational and there­
fore that preference cannot be drawn by the Congress.
QUESTION:

As I understand it, Miss CopeIon,

your argument would be no stronger and no weaker if the
so-called Hyde amendment were part and parcel of the statute
originally enacted by Congress, is that correct?
MISS COFELON:

That's correct, lour Honor, because

25
it would be an exclusion in the context of that programQUESTION:

Exactly,

MISS COPELON:

And it emphasizes in a ser.se the

difference and the very critical differences between this
case and Maher v. Roe decided three years ago.

In Maher,

the Court vras dealing only with the question of covering
elective abortions in the context of a program which
covered only medically necessary services, and the Court
found that not part of the general mandate of the program.
Here the Solicitor concedes that it would have
been but for the Hyde amendment.

No doctor's judgment

which this Court has consistently protected and recognized
the importance of, from all of the abortion decisions, no
doctors judgments about the health of the pregnant women
were at issue in that case.

The plaintiffs in that case

were asking that the program effectively be extended»

-We

are saying the exclusion of one service, the singling out
of one service raises the fundamental equal protection
problem and —
*

QUESTION:

Miss Copelon, you say it is irration­

al to prefer the fetal life interest to the health of the
mother.

That involves a weighing of respective interests

and suggests that the Court just say that, although
Congress thought it was a rational choice, that we should
just disagree with them?

26
MISS COPELON:

Your Honor; I think that when one

looks at the decisions of this Court, that —
QUESTION:

Well, isn!t that answerable yes or no?

MISS COFELON:

The answer is it is not'a rational

choice in the context of a medical program involving
medically necessary service and ----QUESTION:

Even though Congress thought it was

quite rational, we should disagree with that value judgment?
MISS COPELON:
judgment.

Your Honor, it is not a value

It is basic to the Constitution and basic to

what this Court held in Roe v. Wade.
QUESTION:

But anyway, you suggest we disagree

with Congress in that judgment, whatever kind of a judgment
it was'?
MISS COPELON:

However one characterizes the

congressional judgment, Your Honor, yes, we suggest that
the Court must disagree and -~
QUESTION:

And the Constitution disagrees?

MISS COPELON:

That’s right, and the reason that

the Constitution disagrees I think is best illustrated if
one looks at what the Court did in Roe v. Wade when it
looked at the third trimester.

The relationship between

that situation and ours compels the conclusions that the
tradeoff here between fetal life and maternal health and
life is irrational.

27
QUESTION':

When you say the word "irrational,"

I take it you mean literally those who voted to adopt the
Hyde amendment belong in the looney bin.
MISS COPELON:

Mo, Your Honor, I ’wouldn't say

that at all.
QUESTION:

Well, that to me is v?hat the word

"irrational" means, that they just went off the wall.
MISS COPELON:

As a legal matter I would not make

that contention, Mr,, Justice Rehnqulst.

The point here Is

not how one characterizes that but rather whether in the
scheme of our Constitution it Is rational to make that
preference, and I would like to go back to the third tri­
mester in Roe v. Wade, if I may.

That Is the point where

there was no privacy interests of the woman.
QUESTION:

What if we had a Jones amendment,

let us say, that excluded, as the Hyde amendment does
■with respect to these abortions, excluded the treatment

for dreg addiction on the grounds perhaps that drug addic­
tion is self-induced and just excluded it, would your
position be the same?
MISS COPELON:

Your Honor, it would raise very

different questions because there would be a question of
whether to include —
QUESTION:

It would be irrational?

MISS COPELON:

I wouldn’t want to say whether

23
it was irrational unless i saw the context in which the ex­
clusion came up.
QUESTION:

Well, the context would be exactly

the legislation we now have and add in exactly the words
of the Hyde amendment "drug addiction."
MISS CGPELOM:

Your Honor, it might be irrational.

However, this case has a different kind of question and. the
question here is really the validity of that tradeoff be­
tween fetal life and maternal health and. life, and I would
just in — so that the Court understands, when I speak of
a tradeoff here,' I am relying on the findings of fact of
the District Court that the Hyde amendment resulted in
basically a virtually total exclusion of certifications of
medically necessary abortions, and that given the way the
Hyde amendment functions with all its uncertainty and
with the impossibility of prediction of serious problems
of pregnancy, to have a statute which says a doctor can
be paid for, he waits for the patient to get worse means
that that woman is placed in life jeopardizing situations*
and when the maternal mortality studies show that abortion
frequently performed at the brink of death and fre­
quently fai 1■

so what we are talking about here is in

the health of women but to their very lives.

QUESTION:

Do you think that the evidence taken

by a single federal judge over a period of months under our
constitutional scheme warn intended to be allowed to invali­
date a judgment of the elected representatives of the
people under the equal protection clause?
MISS COPELQN:

Your Honor9 I think that facts

must always be relevant to the question —~
QUESTION:

But who decides the facts?

MISS COPELON:

Well, in this case the Court de­

cides the facts and. the Constitution decides whether or not
the ultimate judgment is rational.

Here the findings of

fact of the District Court with regard to some of the
questions earlier to the Solicitor demonstrate and the
Court found that normal childbirth cannot be affected
through the Hyde amendment, that normal childbirth is
medically impossible for reasons that the encouragement
here, as the Chief Justice said., encouragement complicated
pregnancy and also of abnormal fatal birth»
In addition to that, the contention here cannot
be that there is just a state interest in encouraging child­
birth today.

The panoply of family planning programs attest

to the fact that- that alone is not the interest»

So the

interest that the state is asserting over the health and
the life of the woman is the interest in fetal life itself
and

30
QUESTIO!?:
just a minute,

Counsel, may I interrupt there for

You have properly emphasized the importance

of maternal life»

Does the record provide any statistics

as to the mortality rate of expectant women associated
with pregnancy?
MISS COPELON:

Your Honor, there is a fairly ex­

tensive indication of mortality rates in the early find­
ings of the District Court and they are cited in our brief.
QUESTION:

What number per 1,000 or per 10,000?

MISS COPELON:

The normal is 16 women per

100,000; among black women, for example, it is 32 per
100,000»
QUESTION:

32 per —

MISS COPELON:
QUESTION:

100,000 among black women.

32 per 100,000 pregnancies.

MISS COPELON:

Right.

The point, Your Honor, is

that the life endangering standard of the Hyde amendment
is supposed to protect women against life endangering risks.
The measure of those who ultimately die is not the measure
of life endangering risks, and once a woman, as the testi­
mony showed in the District Court found, is in a life
threatening situation, there is no guarantee for her survival.
There are examples that are manifold in the record, of the
problem with this standard.

Let me just cite to you one

which is the problem of the woman who gets pregnant with

31
an IUD In place»

She suffers a 50 times higher risk of

death because of an infection that occurs in the late
second trimester.

You can never tell in the early stages

of pregnancy which woman will suffer it, and the risks go
50 times higher is not a clearly substantial risk before
the infection strikes.

The FDA and even HEW recommend

that the IUD cannot be removed.

It is medically essential

to do an abortion because of the danger of that rapid in­
fection which if it strikes it is very difficult tc control.
So this is a situation where —- and the FEW
statistics show that between 1972 and *7^» 17 women died
in this manner in this country.

So it is an example, Your

Honor, of the problem of using maternal mortality statistics
to measure the scope of life endangermant.

Even the

defendant-intervenors1 witnesses in this case, one in par­
ticular testified that the risks of poor women are twice
as high, two to three times higher than for women of the
middle and upper classes, and that in addition

he would

estimate that his population, which is at a Catholic
hospital and involves people coming for prenatal care,
would estimate 15 percent of those pregnancies would
encounter life endangering circumstances».

So when one

compares that with the fact that you have less than one
percent of prior abortions now certified under medicaid,
the District Court1s conclusion that really the effect of

32
the uncertainty of the standard and the fear of investiga­
tion really leads to a crisis intervention standard, which
is simply too late.
I would like to get back to what I think is the
crucial question in this case, which is this question of
the balance that Congress struck between fetal life —
QUESTION:

Before you day, you put considerable

emphasis on the Hyde amendment does not encourage normal
childbirth —
MISS COPELON:
QUESTION:

That's right.

— and encourages abnormal childbirth.

Why does that make a difference?
MISS COPELON:

Your Honor, I think that makes a

difference because it changes the balance of concern that
is involved in this case.

What it says is that at the ex­

pensive of maternal health and maternal life and even, as
Mr, Justice Stevens indicated, fetal life, one is going
to have this virtually absolute preference for fetal life.
And we say that in the context of the Constitution, which
is written for the people, and as Roe v. Wade said, which
protects born people, one cannot make that tradeoff between
people who exist and the potentiality of future life,

it

is the Constitution upon which we rely that says that this
is a fundamentally irrational tradeoff.
QUESTION:

Well, is this an argument that the

33
fetus is not a person for purposes of the Constitution?
MISS COPELON:

Your Honor, that has been decided,

it is not a person for the purposes of the Constitution,
and I dare say that in our health care system, even if some
whole person’s life is at stake, we don't ask another
person to involuntarily sacrifice their health and their
life for their well-being In the third trimester in Roe v. Wade, where
tlie. Court found the fetal interest, the interest in poten­
tial fetal life so compelling that.you could criminalize

and prevent abortion, still the Court said where maternal
life or health is at stake, the abortion must be permitted.
And we submit, Your Honors, that you have decided what
the Constitution requires and what the minimum of rational­
ity is or legitimae;- of purpose is under the Constitution
and you decided that in Hoe v. Wade,

And the difference

between the regulatory context of Roe v. Wade and the

furlirg context of this ease is not a difference which is
relevant to that balance, because something that is funda­
mentally irrational, not under some heightened standard
of scrutiny but fundamentally irrational simply cannot
survive whether you are dealing with funding or not, and
the basic teaching of Maher was to reaffirm that balance
of interests that tbs Constitution commanded in Roe v.
Wade, and to reaffirm that even where the state is simply

giving out benefits, it must do it in a basically rational
way.
QUESTION:

Miss Cope Ion, let me- ask you in con­

nection with the case that is non-funding, which you are
not now talking about, Stanley v. Georgia, where the Court
found that the government couldn’t prohibit the possession
of pornography even in one’s own home as well as any
number of other books in one's own home, based, on an im­
plied by the privacy, nevertheless two or three years after
Stanley, in United States v. Ridell, the Court held that
the government could prohibit the purchase or sale of
pornography even though the purchaser intends to use it
in his home, doesn't that suggest that although the govern­
ment must allow certain things If they are done entirely
apart from government support, the government may proscribe:
access to avenues that would enable the person to enjoy
that right?
MISS COPELON:

Your Honor, I think it is a very

different case, the case of pornography and also the case
of distribution and sale as opposed to use.

In terms of

Griswold and Eisenstadt, it seems to me that the Court has
dealt with the difference between distribution and sale
as founded in a regulatory context not to be relevant.
The pornography example Just doesn't involve the kind of
violation of what we would call either feasie or rational

35
permissible judgment under the Constitution, whether one
calls it rational or one calls it the absence of a legiti­
mate state interest in light of the constitutional decision
of Roe Vo Wade.,
QUESTION:

The Court had. held that the State of

Georgia could not prohibit the reading of whatever book
one wanted in his own home3 and yet in Ridell the Court
said that a federal statute making inaccessible in effect
books which the person might want in his own home was per­
fectis? constitutional.
MISS COPELON:

But 9 Your Honor, I think that the

more apt anaology would be If there were some kind of fund*
ing program involved, and it would be hard to see how there
could be a claim for the payment of pornography under soma
kind of funding program that involved —
QUESTION:

1 thought you were arguing that the

funding distinction was irrelevant and that we ought to get
back to the case where the government simply prohibits or
allows, rather than as In Maher fund.
MISS COPELON:
vant.

I am not saying that it Is irrele­

I am saying that it is irrelevant to the question

of the rational reltionship or legitimacy of a preference
for fetal life over maternal health and life, and that that
base line irrationality in Roe v. Wade has to carry over,
because something can’t become rational In one context and

not rational in another.
We are not dealing, today with any question here
of heightened scrutiny.

We have done that in our brief.

What we are saying is minimal scrutiny says that this is
not rational in this context, and that Roe v. Wade as a
constitutional matter has decided that question.
QUESTION:

Was there any consideration in the

court below or any argument about whether the court should
simply declare the amendment unconstitutional and leave it
up to Congress as to whether to eliminate the funding for
all abortions or just some or —

That's correct, and —

Rather than leaving the solution up

to Congress?
MISS COPELON:

Right, and I think what you are

referring to is what one might enhance by calling the
separation of powers argument here.
The court denied it.

That was made below.

The court relied very strongly on

this Court’s decision in Lovett which states the basic

37
principle and has been reaffirmed since in Powell v.
McCormack, that the legislature, even with powers particu­
larly confided to it, cannot act in an unconstitutional
mannerj and the Court held basically —
QUESTION:

Well, that may be true.

That is just

begging the question of which way should it cure the —
of course it eanft violate the Constitution -— which way
to cure it,
MISS CGPELON:

Well, I think it should cure if

in the same exact way. Your Honor, as the Court cures the
problem in Califano v. Westcott.

There is

basically no

difference between this case and Califano in that the
funding rider, as the Solicitor General interprets it,
modifies the program and the question then is what would
Congress have wanted if Congress were to choose and I —*
QUESTION:

Well, should that be left up to

Congress after the Court has held that what Congress did
do is unconstitutional?
MISS COPELON:

Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that

the majority was correct in Califano and that that holding
is even more correct here.

In both cases, there was an

ea .licit indication from Congress that they didn’t want
to fund something, and the question was, given the
favorability clause of the Social Security Act, would
Congress have intended to eliminate the program.

38

on the part of the Court, but Congress knows what it wants

QUESTION:

matter of political prediction, but Isn’t that for Congress

MISS COPSI/ON:

Your Honor, I think the obliga­

Is to decide that question, and there is evidence »- for
example, in 1975? Congress failed to pass a rider.

didn’t stop the HEW appropriations, they have never stopped
the NEW appropriations, even though the proponents of the
Hyde amendment yearly tried to cut back on the additional
language —

QUESTION:

Before or after, at any time.

MISS COPELON:

Yes, they would be free, but the

question of what remedies should come from this Court is
based on the kind of assessment the Court made in Califano
v. Westeotfc. and we submit that the devastating impact and
the importance and centrality of the medicaid, program argue
even more powerfully than in Califano y, Westeotfc that the
injunction should remain intact.
QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that a court may

direct and command the Congress how to exercise the taxing
and spending power?

Isn't that what your statement comes

down to?
MISS COPELON:

Your Honor, I think every time

the Court reviews a classification in a welfare program,
like in Califano v. Westeotfc or Goldfarb v. Califano, it
is doing; effectively that.

It is basically deciding

whether Congress can make exceptions that it has made or
whether it has to fund something that it may not have wanted
to,

If you couldn't do that, you could never look at a

statute under inclusiveness of Involving the payment of
benefits —
QUESTION:

Well, let's say the Hyde amendment

does say something different from what it did say, cr

i|0
let's not call it the Hyde amendment but the Smith amend­
ment , had said Title 19 shall be applicable only to nonwhite people, shall not cover anybody who is Caucasion or
who is white.

That, I presume we could agree, would,

violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
MISS COPELON:
QUESTION:

Yes, it would.

But wouldn't that be the extent of a

court's power to so state and then leave it up to Congress
whether they wanted to Include everybody or not anybody?
MISS COPELON:

Your Honor, I think that is a

different case and one would have to look at —
QUESTION:

Constitutionally, why is It different"

MISS COPELON:

Constitutionally, basically I

think the Court should order the expansion of the program
but constitutionally it might be different if, for example,

and so many not benefitted that it would not be clear -.

So it

funds»
I would 15.ke to turn now with the minutes re­
maining to me to the First Amendment arguments and the
First Amendment claims that were treated by the District
Court.

The fact I think, going back to the tradeoff be-

tween maternal life and health and fetal life, brings into
full picture in this Court the nature cf the underlying
interests, and that is that Congress wanted to and the
proponents of the Hyde amendment sought to take a position
and they did take a position on the question of when human
life begins.

That question this Court held in Roe v. Wade

is impermissible and I submit that is impermissible: under
the Fifth Amendment.
It is in addition, as the record will extensively
document, is impermissible under the First Amendment, in
both the First Amendment establishment clause and free

exercise clause.

This is the first time in at least a

decade that this Court has had before it a ease which raises
at once the establishment and free exercise claims» and it
requires a special scrutiny.
We are concerned hereas the Chief Justice said

MISS COPELON:

Well, Your Honor, our position is

that the problem here is that not only is the anti-abortion
movement essentially religious, but it is taking a position
on a religious question and therefore it is religiously
biased legislation which impacts particularly on poor
women in a medicaid program which has as a principle to
accommodate religion.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. MeORES. JR.» ESQ.s
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL
MR. MeCREE:
I may.

I have just two points to make, if

On the first instance, no plaintiff in this case

48
claims that she wanted an abortion because of an abnormal
child.

That isn’t in the case at all.
And the second point, we didn’t address the es­

tablishment clause argument because the Court had ruled
against it and we would rely on our brief in its discussion
of MeIowan and cases of that sort on that point.
QUESTION:
a question.

Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask you

Your opponent has focused more narrowly on

the precise interests of the government at stake here than
I had. really caught before.

In your summary of argument,

you describe the interest as that in preserving potential
human life and encouraging childbirth.

But she makes the

point that there is no overriding government interest in
having a largerpopulation, as soma countries sometimes
want to encourage childbirth generally.

I take it you do

rot mean by that just encouraging more births throughout
the country

you really are talking, or ara I wrong, about

the notion of preserving fetal life and the unborn fetus
a chance to survive?

That is what it is limited to, isn’t

it?
MR. McCREB:

That’s the point in our brief aid

that is —>
QUESTION:

There Isn’t any national or state

interest in having more people in the country.
MR« MeCREE:

Although we are not making "that

argument, although that, would be a legitimate reason for*
the Congress to enact such legislation.
QUESTION:

There is no indication that that was

in fact the reason that motivated anybody in this case.
MR* MeCRES:

That’s corrects there is no such

fact.
QUESTION:

If you: had a negative birth rate for

a sustained period of time, I should think that would be
quite a significant and important argument.

It would

eventually shrink to a point where it might not be able to
exist economically, if you project yourself a hundred yearn
down the road.
MR. McCREE:

We would agree with that, Mr,

Justice Powell.
QUESTION:

Of course, the other side of the coin

is that over-population is a greater threat, I suppose,
MR. MeCRES:

We say these are considerations of

the Congress.
QUESTION:

General MeCree, certainly a hundred

years ago a large family was considered social security
for tie parents, because they realised that they would have
to derive the work from the farm from the children who
would in turn support them.

So I would think it would be

difficult to say it wasn’t at least a rational interest to
say to bring more people into the world was not such.

MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:

We would agree with that proposition.
But I take it your point is, Mr.

Solicitor General, that at any given time, whatever the
population situation may be, this is e. matter for Congress
to decide and. not for the Court?
MR. McCREE:

Its wisdom Is committee to the

Congress and not to the Court,
