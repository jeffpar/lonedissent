MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argumenta

next in Deposit Guaranty National Bank v, Robert L. Roper.
Mr* Goodman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. GOODMAN, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOODMAN $

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pisses® the

Court t
Rule 23 cases somehow tend to evoke ©motional and
hypothetical arguments from both sides,
such arguments insofar as possible.

I will try to avoid

I will try to deal with

the realities of this eerie on its marits, because my hope is
to persuade this Court to deal with this case in the same
manner.
Very briefly, two credit card holders sued the bank
in 3.971«

The District Court denied certification in October

of 2375.

Interlocutory appeal was denied by the Court of

Appeals in December of 1975,

Over seven months later, the bank

tendered to the two plaintiffs all that they demanded

the

litigation was concluded.
An appeal was then attempted on behalf of an unnamed
and uncertified class.

And the Court of Appeals reversed,

rejecting the mootnass concept and want further to order
certification.

Hence, tills petition.

4
QUESTION?

Meanwhile, X assume, unless the other

members of the potential class read about it in the newspapers,,
would not have known anything about this lawsuit, its ir^rjss/
is th at, correct?
MR. GOODMANt

W© don’t know the answer to that, Your

Honor, but we do know this:

that from 1971 to the present date,

according to the record, not a single other customer of the bank
had filed suit, joined this suit, sought to intervene, or.-made
a complaint, from 1971 to 1979, not a single other customer
had clone any of those things.

That w@ know from the record*

Of course, your friend might argue that they may have
refrained from doing so in reliance upon what they thought was
the existence of a class action, ©van though it was not
certified.
MR. GOODMAN*

Of course, any response to that, Your

Honor, would b© that it was not certified.

It was simply filed

in a Clerk’s offlea and entitled a class action.
was
case
join

V-iiied.,

Certification

As I said, over seven months went by before the

was finally terminated.

And no one made any effort to

or intervene or enter the suit in any fashion.

And

that leads ms to say that this Court has previously dealt, in
effect, with two situations*

on® an appeal for a certified

anonymous class,., despite- a mooted -plaintiff,., and where the-»
only identifiable person shewing an ©vident continuing interest
in ilia legal issue was counsel.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Goodman,

MR. GOODMAN? Yes, sir.
QUESTIONs

I don't know whether you said or not,

nobody triad to intervan® up until now?
MR. GOODMANs
Your Honor.

And not now.

I meant to say that.

That is exactly right.

I may not have said it.

No

\

one has attempted to intervene at any point, including up until
today-,
Now, you have previously considered a situation
where there was an appeal on behalf of a certified class,

In

addition, the Court has considered a situation where there was
an appeal by an intervener after denial of certification, and
after a settlement by -the named plaintiffs.

But today yon are

considering a situation where named plaintiffs with moot claims
asked the appellat® court to ravers© the trial court's denial
of class status with no interveners.
QUESTION * ' Mr, Goodman, you referred to our previous
casea and, certainly, in cases like Jacobs and Scana and Franks
and United Air Lines and Rodrigues we have dealt with various
fcrsar in the class action forest.

Do you think all of our

cases are reconcilable?
MR. GOODMANg
Your Honor,

I think the cases are reconcilable,

I think that sometimes when we writ© a particular

opinion vr© tend to say it a little bit strong for the particular
version being put forth.

And I am familiar with all of those

6

cases and that’s what I was referring to.

But today you are

confronted with a situation where the plaintiffs with nott
claims ar© asking the appellate court somehow to engage in
legal fiction.
And let ms say this g
the lawsuit.

I think this is the hsarfc of

An exercise in legal fiction is unquestionably

required to reverse on appeal and make the reversal, if Your
Honor please, retroactive back past the mootnass occurrence
until the time that the appellat® court says the District
Court should have

certified the case.

Now, that takas an ©xerois© in legal fiction.

She

question before this Court is whether Article 3 permits engag­
ing in such a legal fiction or. perhaps better put, the
question bafor© the Court is the question of whether such a
legal fiction should be employed in the facts of this case*

An intervener comes in and he is

permitted to appeal the denial of class action? right?
MR. GOODMANS
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Now, the only difference between that

case and this one is that there is no intervener, but ,tha
n»i. plaintiffs want to appeal it on behalf of the class?
right?

Yes, sir.

Y®s, sir, but as I recall the dissent,

My point is thies

What the Court has cions, right or wrong, so far the Court has
said, w© can permit an appeal by a certified class because it
acquiras n soparato and distinct legal status.

And we have

not only said that, w© have said that sifnificantly.
w© can permit a certified class to appeal.

And so

And then we coma

along in McDonald and w® can take this a step further, and
w© can permit an intervener to appeal where we do not have a
certified class.
Mow, iff we are now going to say that anytime a
lawyer files a suit and entitles it a class action, doss not

persuade the Court that the case should be certified, the
case becomes moot, that counsel, at his own instance, and on

MR. GOODMANt

Well, let’s talk about that for &.

QUESTIONS

Well, the whole point is if -that was all

of their claim, if you take the class action out and tha only
thing they are entitled to is 800 to 400, than they have gravo
trouble with th© excess of 10,000; don’t they?
But th.® other point is they didn’t agree that’s what

Hera is what

Seven months after the

denial of class certification, the bank said to the two
plaintiffs, "What are you claiming?”
They responded, "Th© bank tender to them every
dollar they were claiming»53
Now, it’s, inferred in tha Court of Appeals that
ther* is something wrong about that.
QUESTION*

What did the bank do?

Mr. Goodman, that isn't really correct.

That's what they were claiming. Weren't they from th®
beginning of tha lawsuit making two separate claims*

one that

they are entitled to $12,00 apiece, or whatever it was, X'
forget tha dollars; and, secondly, that they were entitled
to represent a large group of persons who had similar claims.

12

Didn*t they make both claims?

They did, md they got half

of it when you tendered them the money, but they have navor
gotten the first thing they asked? namely, the right to
represent everybody.
And when did, they lose that right?

When did tkny

lose the right to assert that they had a right to represent
everybody?

right than?
QUESTIONs

Mr. Goodmanf don’t you really have to get

down a little deeper than perhaps Court has in scats of its
clans fiction oases her© and recognise that at least many courts
have.- read Into Rule 23 that it's basically a case managed,
not by clients,

but by lawyers % and. that clients themselves

couldn't car© less about getting $12.00 apiece from the bank,
and that somehow or other, as Justice Stevens cays, the other
half of the issue, ©r at least another part of the issue,

one is whether each client will recover a particular sum of
money and the other of which is whether a rather larga class
which will furnish a rather larga attorney’s fee to attorneys
will ba certified or will not ba certified?
MR» GOODMAN:

That’s a candid look at it, Your Honor,

1 think that, and 1 realise that I am not satisfying your
inquiries over here, and the reason is that I think you a.ra

that somehow the Rule, whan it permits you to request class
action status, permits you to litigate that question all 'the
way up,
Here’s the problems

Now, what the District judge did was? not

It was simply wrong, according to the Court ©£ Appeals»
Now, the Court of Appeals could not enter a

atiac pro tunc type ruling and have that jump back in time to
the time when the District judge entered his ruling,
I think fefj© problem is that if you are conscientious
appellate judge and you have something before you and you think
it was decided wrong below, you know, you feel like you need
to d'jcida it and correct it, but there are many instances»1»
QUESTION:

Mr, Goodman, if you’re talking in terms

of power, I don’t understand why a tender before the issue of

equally moot the cas@.
MR. GOODMANs

Well# I think I couldmak© a strong

argument that it would,
QUESTION:
that it would,

Sure, I think you have made the argument

I think that's exactly the argument you're

making ? that whenever the tender is made to the individual
claimant#if there has been no certification# there is nothing
more to litigate,
MR. GOODMAN:

As 2 understand the rulings# you have

made fin important distinction between the time of certification,

Logically# that distinction is the same#

regardless of whether it is before a presentation to certi ficetion or an erroneous denial of certification.

Logically# you

have the earn® raootnass problem# it seems fcc me.

MR. GOODMAN:

Is money, and if these nsm.&d plaintiffs

reco'/er their money, they have recovered their entire stake.
Now, what has happened in the Fifth Circuit, and
perhaps in other places around the country, this is exactly
what * s happened.

First, they cams along with Titi® VTI cases,

let'» say, and the named plaintiff's controversy would become
moot, but the Court would'say because) it's this type of case,
and because Congress has entrusted the Federal courts with
the particular responsibility in this kind of case, sort of a
private attorney general concept, that the nexus is there, end
we will continuo with th© lawsuit, with legal fiction, perhaps
justified, perhaps not,

the realism?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHAMP LYONSf JR.
OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR» LYONS s

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please the

Court*
There have been charges made during -the briefing and,
to some extent, during argument, that this is an action main­
tained for the benefit of the attorneys.

I don’t mam to tak©

'undue omberage # hut X do detect some suggestion©£ lack of
professional conduct.

There has been no evidence whatsoever.
.;

I’m confident that if there had been any evidence of it, the
defendant v?ould have been able to produce it.

''That# we submit#

ia a smokescreen.
This io not purely a commercial damage action,

W©

must not loss night of tho fact that this is a charge of usury
by a National bank, an instrumentality of the United States in
dim

violation of a Federal statute*
Usury has been universally condemned by about every

culture "that our civilisation has produced.

This is not a

technical unurly claim of one-half a point or so forth# this

s': & charge of 10 percent over the legal rat© of interest.
It involves claims that will range from $100.00 on up.

to the extraction of $12 million in illegal interest from, a
class composed of upwards of 90,000 people in ths State of

In that postur®, the public interest is involved and
this is an action charging a violation of a Federal statute.
QUESTIONs

Well, Mr» Lyons, isn't that exactly vhy

we have to explore hers just the recovery of individual plain­
tiffs but whether, in adopting Rule 23, it was intended to con­
fer not only the right to litigate about individual claims, hut
about the right to litigate whether or not a class should be
certified as a class action?

MR. LYONSs

Yes, sir, that is essential to my theory

of the harmonizing of all of those cases which Your Honor
referred to as many trees in the class action forest.

In all

of the cases in which we find language that a properly-certified
class avoid mootness, in non© of those cases was the right to
proceed as a class action a litigated issue in a case, as it
is heri.
In only on® case, this Court granted certiorari
and vacated the proceedings as moot where the class notion
was e litigated issue in the case.
Northern States Power.

And that is Ihrks v«

But in that case the Court of Appeals

had said no, the District Court was right, it shouldn't be a
olaes, differant from the case hers»
QUESTION 5

What w©r© your options whan the Court

denied class action certification?
HP* LYONSs

In fact, what happened, when the Court

denied class action certification^ on interlocutory appeal was

20

sought to the Fifth Circuit»

And the defendant success fully

opposed it* And the seven-month hiatus period that has been
talked about

was consumed during that proceeding.

Then the

'plaintiffs came back and moved for summary judgment on the
individual claim and at that.time the tendar was mad©»

It; was

filed with the Court in the form of Confession of Judgment.

WE

served a counter offor judgment, which would have expressly
made the defendants agree that the class issue is available
for review.

They wouldn't have anything of it.

The District Court entered a judgment over our
objection and the money remains in the court'as of this data.
Now, the thing we can't lose sight of is the Fifth
Circuit held this was a classic case for class action treat­
ment, and

there had been, indeed, an abuse of discretion.
QUESTIONs

That question, as 1 understand,in view

of cur limited grant is not before us here, whether the Court
of Appeals was right or wrong oh the merits of the class
action.
HR. LYONSs

That's correct.

QUESTIONS

Is that correct?

HR, LYONSs

That’s correct,

And the intent, of the

named plaintiffs here was nothing more than a deliberate act
to destroy jurisdiction»

It was a calculated gimmick.

And

they refer in their briefs of being weary of the litigation,
I think electrified of the possibility of having

21

to pay back the illegal interest is what motivated their entire
conduct.

The case of controversy rule, the basis for it in a

tripartite government, it makes sansa that the judicial power
not be exercised except in real cases and not in imaginary
cases»
It is also a device for ensuring the quality of an
adversary proceeding in the form that w© have historically
become accustomed to resolution of judicial controversy.

I

submit that we have that her©.
There ara cases where both partias'say, "Please rule?
we have got to have an answer to this*5, and this Court has said,
“Oh, no, just because both parties want th© answer that doesn't
mean that this Court is going to have a case of controversy
jurisdiction.“
Those casse aren't in point hare.
party that doesn't want any ruling.

We have got on©

We have got on© id?,at says

this is a live and active controversy, and that's th© plain"
tiff.
Now, mootness is a time dimansion of standing,

Thar©

is no question at the time of commencement of this action th©
named plaintiffs had standing, and they possessed all of the
prerequisites of Rule 23.
QUESTION?
I arc. confused.

Mr. Lyons, lat m© get at this another way.

Look, you writ© the bank and you say, "Look,

if you don't pay me my money now you owe me, I'm going to sue

22

you#’5

And the bank says, ’’Okay, I’ll pay#3

You don’t have

any suit though.
HR. LYONSs
QUESTION;

That’s right.
You fils the lawsuit and tha day after

you filed it, the bank comes in and says, wWe'll pay you.1
You are still going for your class action#

You have a right

for your class action#
MR. LYONS s
QUESTIONs
HR# LYONS s

Yes, sir.
X have trouble with that.
Y©a, sir, and I think there is no basis

for trouble because of tha sauce in tha line of cases, which
recognizes this Court has already embraced a notion that
©tar ling can exist at the commencement of an action.

Events

ceil occur prior to certification which would moot the
individual claim but nonetheless the case of controversy
jurisdiction in ongoing.
QUESTIONs

That's capable of repetition, but

evading a review type of situation where you are not seeking
a money judgment; you’re seeking relief which the particular
named plaintiffs may not, ever be able to obtain because of
tha durational residency requirement.,

1 have trouble with

transferring that over into a simple money judgment question,
MR# LYONSs

Both capable of repetition but yet

evading review standards in the mootness field in the concept
of voluntary cessation of illegal conduct ii? not being a

23

basis for mootness arose historically in fchs injunctive con­
text.

This is an action for money damages, but I submit that

both doctrines have a field of operation her©.

The voluntary

cessation of illegal conduct is a ready analogue to paying two
out of

90,000 claims? therefore, that act ought not be viewed

as it existed for purposes of mootnsss.
They have argued in their brief that it is not what
is the cause of mootness, but the fact that very rule, the
voluntary cessation of illegal conduct flies in the face of
that.
Secondly, capable of repetition, yet evading
revie’...

We all recall the

ICC where there was a rats order

that was going to expire -and it did expire, and they said
no capable of repetition evading review go forward.

QUESTIONs

Is your position consistent with Jacobs

MR, LYONSs

Yes, sir,

Jacobs, the question of

29

certification was not before the Court in this proceeding.
The litigation of whether or not there should have been a
certification never cams up.
The Sosna Case is in harmony with this.

But the

Spsna Case said that th© fact of a certified class may be
a sufficient basia to avoid a finding of mootness.
X respectfully submit that the certiflability of the
class is also a basis for th© avoidance of mootness in that
th® Soane Case isn't inconsistent with that because nobody
litigated in SOSNA.
QUESTIONS

But you have to pray for certification in

your complaint in order to harmonise it with Jacobs.
HR. LYONSi

Yes, sir, you have to ask for certifica­

tion, and you have to have it refused and you have to keep
litigating it, which we did.
QUESTIONS

tffiiat you*re saying, on the practical side

of it, these problems would be solved if there was a require­
ment that class action — denial of certification be appealed
v.

30 days and resolved right at th© threshold?
HR. LYONS:

That would be a solution fco the

problem and would avoid the dilefea that no review of certifica­
tion creatos,

but if there can be no immediate review of

certification, aa ws understand the law to be today, then unless
there is review after judgment, then you're down the deadend
a treat of no review and you have to indulge in the presumption

30

that tha District Court*s discretion on th® denial of class
action is infallable.

And I frankly find that abhorrant

to fcha system of justice I have come to expect, with the right
to review of final judgment of a District Court of the United
States on all your claims.
QUESTION i

That presupposes 'that it is a valid case

or controversy type of Article 3 claim to say that you want to
represent a <5lass of people whom you don’t know probably,

Has tha Court ever really

decided yet clearly that that is a case that can right itself

MR. LYONS*

Well, th® Court has said this, that

and that th© doctrine of relation back where th© issue

will otherwise evade review is available.

How, they say

1 say that if there be a

fiet'on, tiis greater fiction is to say that the case of
controversy is gone and there is no mootness because two out
of 90,000 claims have been satisfied.

When you refer to the doctrine of

relation back, are you referring to Spans?
MR. LYONSi
QUESTION s
didn’t it?

Footnote 11 in Sosnju
That *3 imply left the questionopen,

31

MR. LYONS s

Your Honor, it does speak in the ccutext

of & transitory, temporal type claim*

Wa respectively submit

the doctrine is equally applicable here where the transitory
appeal time has gat to run before you can get up and then get
your review and then it ought to relate back to the date you
were in District Court asking for certification.

The dofondants

never challenged the standing at that time.

QUESTION:

But those ar© the kinds of open questions

wa have got. to decide or put to one side in this case,
MR. LYONS a

Yes, Your Honor.

1 don’t think it

requires an expansion of any existing precedent.

Z think it

is just a situation of new wine in old bottles. . It’s just that

MR. LYONS:

If he refuses tha tender?
Yes, because he has shown ha is not

really interested in his own claim anymore.
MR. LYONSi

He's interested in his own claim to the

extant that he doesn't want to do anything to jeopardise the

33

other prong of his being there, and that's the fiduciary
duty to the class.
QUESTIONS

I must confess I'm a little troubled

by Mr, Justice White's example.

In terms of Article 3, why

is there such a difference between going in to the bank in­
formally

and say, "Pay us off now and we won’t sue you.:i

Then there is no lawsuit.

Thay, obviously, can’t coma in the

next day and represent the class.

Mid paying him off three

days after the lawsuit is filed, why wouldn’t that moot th©
case?
Because ons distinction is whan they pay

off after the lawsuit is filed, that is a voluntary cessation

of illegal conduct which is calculated to evicerate Rule 23,
which this Court ought not tolerate,
QUESTION:

Ho, it’s not because it’s voluntarily

ceasing illegal 'conduct,

They say,"W® think we’ve done

everything lawful all along, but w@ want to get you out of our
hair, so we’ll just pay you off and you can’t sue us".

Now

how do we have a live case or controversy that even bo
certified?
HR, LYONS t

Because they did it because they wanted

to e-void til© fact there’s a good class action here.

That’s

what they did it for,
QUESTION*

But that stands W. T, Grant on its

head to say that paying a money judgment is a voluntary

That’s always been in the

Mr. Lyons, th© fiduciary duty of the

After certification, it would be my view that the
duty ought to be on the member of the class to ascertain the
