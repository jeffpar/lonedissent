MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 79-602, Agias v. City of Tiburon.
Mr. Kanner, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GIDEON SCANNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. SCANNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Particularly in view of the controversy that.
i

erupted in the briefing, it seems appropriate to empha­
sise some of the facts in this case.
QUESTION;

In this case —

It is mor© the volume of the briefing

than the controversy, Mr. Kanner.
/

MR. FANNER:

The ar?.ici have • indeed been proV.. , •

lific, Your Honor.

We have here a combination of factors.

Thor® is an impact of —• a tv«-fcp.d impact on the subject
property,

We have first of all the regulatory impact,

the intrusive regulation which in fact appellants contend
deprives the subject property of all use and value in the
marketplace.

The second factor which has not in our view

received the -proper amount of attention from the appellees
Tids- is that' vs have here a fairly extensive, longstanding
and ov-art acquisatory activities by the city, that is,

lc: .3 standing official announccsaents and commitments

4
to acquisition of this property and long-standing studies
by experts indicating that this property was to be an in­
dispensable part of the city's open, space.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kanner, let me ask you a question

about the procedural posture of the case, because of my
lack of familiarity with California law.
As I understand it, your clients brought .an ac­
tion in the Superior Court of Marin County and demurrer
to one count was sustained and demurrer to another was
overruled?
MR. SCANNER:

Not quite, Your Honor.

The second

count was also sustained, but with leave to amend.
QUESTION:
MR. TANNER:

With —
Yes, -that was the declarator^ re­

lief count and the plaintiffs then declined to amend and
stood on that part of the plea.
QUESTION:
■

Well, what I'm puzzled about is, do

hcr/s any way of knowing whether ultimately your client

ww '..Id ?>3 allowed to build one house per acre on this fives
acre tract, or only one house on the entire five acre
tract?

MR. KANNER:

There is no wav of knowing that,

and that is precisely —
QUESTION:
MR. KANNER:

There was

a way, wasn’t there?

bacr vour oar don?

5

QUESTION:

There was a wav, wasn’t there?

The

administrative remedy?
MR. KANNER:

Well, there was no administrative

remedy on this ordinance, Your Honor.

There was, would have

been., had Mr. Agins gone ahead and dec:idea to build,.

The

point is that one owns property not necessarily to build.
He may wish to sell it; he may wish to do something else
with it.

The point is that the property, the allegation

goes, has now bean rendered unusable and worthless in this
marketplace.
QUESTION:
MR. KANNER:
QUESTION:
MR. YAMMER:

Unusable for any purpose?
For any purpose.,
Can't you build one house on it?
Well; we suggest,. Your Honor, that

we cannot because, again, Your Honor has me at a disadvanh

tage precisely because of the procedural
posture mentioned
.r
....

r

by Mr. Justice Relinquish, and that is, ue have before Your
Honors a complaint that has never been even amended once.
The demurrer. was sustained without leave to amend even once,
so ue only'have fciia bare language of the pleading, under
California: practice the so-called pleading of ultimate
farts, which heaven forbid, r.ust not be evidentiary facts.
That is forbidden.
So :-/c cannot on this record point to any facts
that would present the court with the evidence that we

could put on had we been permitted to go to trial.
QUESTION:

Doss the City of Tiburon have a zon­

ing commission before whom you could have gone and asked
leave to build on® house per acre?
MR. KANNER:

1 presume they do.

The point, our

point here is. Your Honor, however, that we're dealing
with a legislative enactment.

We're dealing here with an

extensive zoning ordinance that covers a wide area, and
after thin court’s ruling in the Forest Cifcv Enterprises
case and parallel California cases which are cited in the
briefs, that is a purely legislative act so that there
were no administrative remedies to exhaust this ordinance.
The legislation- itself does not set up any administrative
review procedure so that one could, do it only in the same
that if the legislature of the State of California
"3 to adopt an unconstitutional statute, one could say,,
'‘'-

hir why . c n’t you go to Sacramento and ask them to

change it before you challenge it in court?*'
Now, as 1 understand this court’s precedents,
that is Euclid v. Ambler, which was quite explicit on the
point, that is not required to be done.
QUESTION:

Would you know at this point then

whether if you had followed seme sort of zoning board or
adjustment board procedure, vou might or might act have
been allowed to build one house per acre?

7

MR. KANNERs

That is correct.

This court does

not know it on this record —
QUESTICN:

Could I just ask you, what do you do

about the statement by your supreme court in California
that says,

“According to the wording of the ordinance of

which we may take note, the RPD-1 zoning allows plaintiff
to build between one and five residences on their pro­
perty"?
MR. KANNER:
QUESTION:

That ~
This belies plaintiffis claim that

development of their land is forever prevented.

Now,

that5s what the supreme court of California said.

MR. XANNER:

That vas directed, Your Honor, in­

to the second count, the declaratory relief count, and
under California law remedies —
QUESTION:

— directed to, it says that under

the zoning ordinance, you can build one to five houses.
MR. SCANNERs

Well, this court in Nectow v.

'-ridge said quilo the contrary.

In that case, that is

or? -it :iiy what the Massachusetts supreme court said, and
iti-

:our■disagreed and said that the owner was, had to

be permitted as hs was chart permittee!, which \m were not i
to put on evidence and satisfy a tries: of fact that notwithstanding such language in the ordinance, he in fact
was not able to pat the property to uses which would b©

8
economically viable that would give him a reasonable
QUESTION:

So you say that we should just, that

we just shouldn’t accept this statement as to what the
zoning ordinance does to you?
MR. KANNER:

That's not quite our position.

The

answer to that is twofold:
\

Number one. there are two causes of action in­
volved there.

This was, this one was directed only to the

facial constitutionality of the ordinance? so that the
California supreme court sale, since the ordinance on its
face allows something, it is not amenable to challenge by
the declaratory relief under California law.

Period.

However, that leaves unanswered the first causes
of ac 'lion, which is the Nee tow v, Cambridge approach, in
1 • v ■>•;*

a is./ notwithstanding the face of the ordinance, let

us lock at the facts.

Suppose the legislature or the local

city were to make seme — let?’s hypothesize a bad faith
situation in which they zone swamp land for highrise office
fov111lags.

Now, would not the owner then be permitted to

came into court and put on evidence and say,

"Look, it’s

impossible to build office buildings on that land.”

We make the same argument esse apt our argument
gees to the economics and the value of the property.
QUESTION:

sell, that's not zoned there tradi­

tionally in para valve, of property for —•

9
MR. RANKER:

That's a point of some importance»

allegation of this complaint not that the value has been
diminished, which incidentally ought to he enough, as a
matter of degree under this court's opinion in Central
Eureka Mining, but we are alleging that it went beyond that:
That the property has been, deprived of all value and
utilityo
QUESTION:

Well, are you telling the court now

that there was anything to prevent you from making an ap­
plication to build five houses, one on each acre?
MR. RANKER:

Yes, Your Honor, the practicalities

of the matter.
QUESTION s
MR. RANKER:

How do you know unless you did it?
i
Well, there is a fairly well-

settled body of state law and Federal law that is to the
extent the Federal courts have considered it, and wa've
cited some of it in the brief, the most recent one in
O.

lifcrnia being Dahl v. City of Palo Alto, which dis­

ci
■■ .vy ■

- California law on that point, and there is a well sad

; ::tr-ine of futility, and that is that if the

posit ■’ on. of the public body is such that it is manifest
that they, have no intention of allowing it, one is not
required to perform an idle act.
The same thing happened .in the Dahl case.
facts are virtually identical.

The

There the City of Palo Alto

10
prstty mush said, "We want those foothills left open? that
is going to be open space? that will he a viewshed for our
city par?:, and that's that."
QUESTION;

You see this as almost, then, as if

the legislature had said your five acres is zoned as a
park, and nothing, nothing should be built on it?

MR, KANSJER:

Just about.

May I invite Your

Honor's attention to page 32 of the appendix in the juris­
dictional statement, which contains some of these standards
as the ordinance puts it.
fake a look at this, for example:

"Land to be

preserved as open space shall be maintained as permanent
open space by dedication to the city of fee title" or of
scenic easements by dr.ad restriction approved by the city
attorney oc by other methods acceptable to the city.,"
Nov, we have here a piece of property, if it's
going to he one house per five acres, we're talking hers
about an estate of unimaginable grandeur or that part of

the country, and even ora house par acre would be quite
lavish.

Wow we have to sell this land to some person who

going to hav© to spend a fortune, and then ha discovers
has to delicate it in tea to the city, if the city

sc requires.
QUESTION:

Economic reality will just mean that

yon cannot develop it, even if you could build one house

1.1
per acre?

That just won’t work?
MR. KMvNBR:

What wa*re saying, Your Honor, is

that there is no way in which there is going to be one
house per acre.

Again, I am again at a disadvantage bs-

iiig bound to the complaint.
QUESTION:

In a legal sense, then, what your

complaint boils down to is that on the allegations in your
complaint, instead of having the demurrer sustained* it
should have bean overruled arid a trial on the facts should
have feaan held.
MR. X&NNERs

That is precisely our position.

If all these arguments from the other side on that point
are correct, then obviously ray client would have lost very
quickly, possibly by summary judgment, if it's all that

cv.t and dried,

And as an advocate, I certainly ascribe-a

grsat deal of significance to the determined effort to
■v.y clients from going fco trial and to put on their

. ride }.ca.

Why?

I;f the evidence is all that bad, they*r®

going to lose like that, aren’t they?

But the evidence

isn't all that bad, and I'm prevented from going into it
her© on this record.
QUESTI01i

You want us to change the procedures

of California courts?
MR. KANN’ER:

Isn't that your complaint?

MR. KANNER:
QUESTION:

Our complaint is that •—
So you want us to change that?

MR. KANNER:

No, Ycur Honor.

Cur complaint is

that they wouldn't let us put on evidence of Federal con­
stitutional violation.
QUESTION:
MR.

KANNER:

Like what?
Deprivation of property without due

process? taki ng of property without just compensation.
QUESTION:

I just don't understand how you get

to that, how you would get that before us if it's not in
the record.
MR. KANNER:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon. Your Honor?

x don't see how you get anything be­

fore us that is not on the record.
MR. KANNER:

W& were denied the opportunity to

have a day in court to put on this evidence.
QUESTION:

You did have sene day; you're in court.

I mean,-' with summary judgiaant you have the same thing,
don't you?
MR. KANNER:

Well, it wasn't a summary judgment..

it was a dismissal here on the pleading

QUESTION:

summary judgment you don’t gat to

put. your evidence in, either, do you?
MR. FANNER:

Well? of course, but had the latter

gone as far as to summary judgment, there at least would
have been evidentiary facts before the —
QUESTION:

{Inaudible) ~ complaining then?

I

think you're complaining about procedure.
,

MR. BANNER:

Oh, no. Your Honor.

I wouldn't have

been complaining then if there had been, no tryable issue
of facts and only an issue of law.

Lawyers know that; there

is always a winner and a loser in every case.

procedure.
MR. BANNER:

Well, may X make *— may I use

Cl

14
hypothesis,. Your Honor?
Suppose we had a criminal prosecution in which a
defendant wants to offer evidence that he was in fact co­
erced into confessing, and he is met by some state statute
which says that the existence of a written confession is
presumptive, is conclusive.

And he is not then permitted

to offer any evidence.
Now, surely we wouldn't have any difficulty with
that, would we?
QUESTION;

That's & rock, and this case is an

orange.
MR. BANNER;

Well, may I point out that there is

neverthaless a similarity. Year Honor.

We were never per­

mitted —

MR. BANNER;
that.

~ {inaudible; —
—• we were never — perhaps only

We were never permitted to put on evidence 02: even

to plead in amended form any additional facts that show
that in fact this ordinance deprives the owner'of all
roo rjonable use and value.

You would have tried to prove that

under this ordinance you would — that the land was anusable?
MR. K&NSER;
WfS

Yes.

We not only would have tried,

■Just as an economic matter, you just

couldn’t —
MR. MANNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And so in effect, this was a device,

and an effective device, to maintain open spaces?
MR. M&NNERs
QUESTION:
MR. MANNER:

Precisely.
Without paying for it?
That is precisely what happened.

It's exactly like Nectow v. Oam.briclge.

We have an c"di-

nance which on its face permits the use, but once the fcrys-T
of fact heard it, hs realised that that ostensibly permitted
use was in fact economically impossible.

The owner would;

be locked into a perpetually money-losing position.
QUESTION:

Did you make this argument before the

California court?
MR. MANNERs

Yes, Your Honor.

Those are the alle­

gations of the complaint —
QUESTION:

No, I know, but did you say that you

were being denied due procos ; by not being able to put o:a
your proof?
MR. MANNER:

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

That was the

argument.
QUESTION:
MR. KA13MEK:
QUESTION:

What die. the court say about that?
The court simply said that it —
Ignore it, or what?

IS
MR- KAMNER;

—- didn't care to deal with that,

that even if there had been a. taking without just compen­
sation the court said that my clients could not recover any
just compensation because their only remedy was invalida­
tion, and than in a rather surprising turn of events, the
California supreme court, without saying so, revival the
common law form of action approach, and. then because my
client asked for the wrong remedy, affirmed a dismissal,
which was a startling development* but that is a matter of
state law*
QUESTION:

Maybe I am missing something here, but

if I understand correctly, the first cause of action was
the action for damages?

MR. iX&BHER:

MR. KRNNER:
QUESTION;

No.- Your Honor.
— you couldn’t.

I don't understand

it.
MR. :kaHNSRs

Well, that's what I'm trying to

respond to, Your Honor.

Under California law, when you

go in declaratory relief, you may only challenge what is

on the fac», of the ordinance.

So that, is, candidly, that

was a secondary consideration to our side of the case be­
cause the face of the ordinance did say all those things
that you ecu Id build, back to Mectov; v. Cambridge.

But you never pleaded that.
Well, that was —
You say — California law, they would

Even if there had been a —

I beg your pardon?
You don’t even plead the conclusion,

as I read the second cause of action.
MR. SCANSiERs

Well, the second cause of action,

Your Honor, is only cl tree tod to the face of the ordinance.
That is where we may not, we simply may not, it is forbid­
den under California law, to deal with the constitutionality

as applied.

For that, until the California supreme court

spoke in this case, the sole remedy ms to go in inverse
condemnation or mandamus.

QUESTION.:

It is only a facial --

No way in California that you could

have, other than .asking for money damages, there is no
way as & matter of California law in which you could have
filed some kind cl a complaint in which you said, "There's
an ordinance hare that says X can build five houses, but
I really can’t build til© five houses.'*

No way you could

tender -that issue?
MR, RANKER:

There -was a way to tender it, the

19

way we did, in facts

by inverse condemnation.

Indeed,

Your Honor, we alleged the ultimate facts, the fact of the
ordinance and the other activities, and I do ask the
court to keep in mind the other activities, the property
was rendered worthless and ’useless.

Those were the ulti­

mate facts.
QUESTION;

Mr. Kanner, supposing that this court

were to hold that California under the Federal Constitution
has a perfect right to withhold the remedy of inverse con­
demnation so long as it grants you the right to establish
the unconstitutionality of the particular ordinance.

None­

theless you would have to prove a taking, I suppose.,
MR. KANNER;

Yes, sir.
Where in the record, may I ask, or in

the jurisdictional statement or appendix, is year complaint?
MR. KANNERs
joint appendix.

The complaint is containad in the

It begins at page 3.

QUESTION?

Oh, thank you.

QUESTION;

Suppose, Mr. Kanner, that your friends

on the other side had come in in their brief and tender©!
on bit elf of: the city assurance that you could build one

:.s

on each of die five acres.

Would you still be here

making these arguments?
MR, K&NNER:

So- Your Honor.

I have been driven

to respond in. a way which I *ra not sure is proper, but I

20
think the court should know that when this ease was being
argued before the California supreme court, Mr. Hearn,
who was arguing the case, offered -to dismiss the action
right then and there on a stipulation that one house par
acre could be hui.lt, and no such stipulation was proffered,
QuESTIOH:

How about one house for tha entire '

five acres?
MR. KANHERs
possibility.

That is a matter of" physical im­

The outside improvements recessary for the

construction of ore house on that parcel of land would
malt® it so expansive that no one could afford it.

That’s

what it boils down to.
Mow, again, I apologize if I’ve transgress>sd

the foundary of the record, but that’s the sort of wi­
der. tiary rauttors that we would have had to go into to
persuade a trier of fact, as was done in Nectow v.
Cambridge, that in fact that just can’t, be don®, no Blatter
what'•that ordinance says.
I did want to emphasis© the other activities
that took place here.

That ie something which this court

has reiver considered and that is the impact of the pr-acondemnation activities of the government, which is net

content just to go ahead and condemn land when they want. to.
but on the contrary, they go ahead and they make announce-”
jar ■and they get sfcudicr and they get planners and it’s

21
all widely reported In the press, -this property is 'being
acquired by the city;
here.

This went on for a period of years

Who in the market is going to be foolish enough to

spend good money to buy land which the city has announced
repeatedly, definitively, this is an indispensable part of
open space city resources, we are going to acquire it, and
in fact they went aheadf adopted condemnation resolution,
brought a condemnation action, and it was then only when
confronting the value of this land — because it is a vary
desirable part of the country

they abandoned the condom

nation and chose to stand on this ordinance, which accom­
plishes the vary same thing, the passive use.
Mow, if the government want? to go in and build
a road on somebody? a property, obviously they have to enter
it. at some point and do It.

But if the use that is desired

by the government is a passive one, such as open space,
they don’t have to cross the clothes, tiiey don’t have to
sot a toe on the property.

to the point: that we have here an extensive record of city

a very clear matter of the doctrine of futility.

QUESTION:

What8s the clear cut case of futility?

Suppose you applied for a — what do you do, apply for a

MR. KAMST&R:

ycu —- shy do you say it- would be futile?
MR. SCANNER?

Bed&ivtm we have here longstanding

city announcement of commitment to the acquisition of this
proparty for its open space.
QUESTION:

So you think they would just turn you

deem to build five houses?
MR. KMJffEK;

Yes, Your Honor.

I again call Your

Honor’s attention to the language of the ordinance, pages
32 anti 33 of the appendix of jurisdictional statement, and
the city has a, has sane four subparagraphs under each of
the®,

Any construction car he turned down under the most

vague and subjective criteria imaginable.

To minimize

visual impact, £©:: ex ample.
In any avent, I would urge the court to consider
the other mode of the city activity.

That is quite criti­

cal ari I see that it. did not capture the court’s mind ae
much as the first issue.

Nevertheless, that is the kind of

o,?ecr.: tic issue which the market reacts to very strongly
because nobody wants to buy land that has a lawsuit attached
■ if.

;

" nobody wants to buy land that is under a cloud of

It is alleged that-/the appellants bought the;

the California supreme court that it be made available for
residential use by the construction it placed upon the
zoning ordinance, that is, at. least on® horae must foe al­
lowed by the city, and up to five may be allowed by the
city under the terras of the zoning ordinance.
It must be recalled that the complaint alleges
that the City of Tiburon has the highest values of land
for residential purposes of any place in California-

and

that this land of appellants* has the highest values with­
in the city.

So we are talking —

ordinary rules of notice pleading an allegation such as
that, the sustaining of a demurrer would have — even if
the ordinance does that

it’s perfectly all right, which

strikes me as a somewhat odd result.
MR. SHUTS;

Wall. Your Honor, I think the answr

lias in the fact that the California supreme court took

judicial notice of the zoning ordinances, and under Californ
lav;, and several cases have done the same, in effect con­
sidered the terms of the zoning ordinance to be a part of
/
the complaint, or a part of the record before the court,
construe those ordinances as requiring the city to allow
residential uss? then determine under the substantive test
for encroachment upon private rights that the remaining
available reasonable use rendered negatory that allega­
tion .
As a matter of law* the ordinances are not ar­
bitrary or capricious.
QUESTION:

What do you have to say about Mr.

Kanner'-s suggestion tha-fc an application to build five
houses, one per aire, would have been utterly futile?
MR. SHOTSs
correct intention.

I think, Your Honor, that's an inThe city — there?5s no indication

that the city would nor consider such an application on

be a matter of common knowledge.

I think that would

So what we say is,, the

city can't very well indicata in advance how many units it
would approve because the necessary environmental review
hasn't occurred, there's no way to know the physical cir­
cumstances in enough detail to indicate how many units
might ha approved.
But the supreme court of our state has said,
residential us© must be approved.
QUEST mi:

Did the city in its response make any

• t you haven’t even taken, this before the zoning
board or the land development, or whatever you have, rather
than simply demurring?

Because — which is, as I under­

stand, is the same thing as saying a motion to the complaint
fails to state the claim on which relief may be granted?
MR. SHUTEs

Actually, an alternative ground of the

demurrer was lack of jurisdiction, which under California
law, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies,
is jurisdictional.

And on® of the grounds of the city's

demurrer was the court lacked jurisdiction precisely be­
cause c" the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
QUEST I DM:

And is it your contention that it was

28
— the demurrer was sustained because of that reasor, or
that the supreme court of California upheld the superior
court’s ruling because of that reason?
HR. SHUTS':

I think, Your Honor, that it impli­

citly did in the sense that it also refused to speculate
at. to how many units might be appropriate by court action
prior to administrative action, and by construing the or­
dinance on its face, that is what is before us,, the faciei
validity of the ordinance, nor. what might b® applied in
certain circumstances that would call on this ordinance for
the submission of a master plan.
QUESTION;

Until there has been soma attempt to

get a plan approved, you couldn’t really tell how the or­
dinance was going to ba applied?
HR. SHUTS:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Th® only issue that was left was the

fa o ia.1 va .1 id ity ?
HR. SHUTS;

QUESTION:

That is correct. Your Honor.

Wall, how touch — is it your position

that the city could have waited five or ten years for, to
get a master plan approved, and meanwhile theses owners
could have kind of bean held in suspense until cha master
plan was finally approved?
MR. SHUTS:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

The

choice to submit a master plan is that of the owner, and

29
could have been undertaken at any time.
QUESTION;

So the owner can simply submit a mas­

ter plan for his five acres to the soiling board?
MR, SHUTS;

That's correct.

And a further point

I would make, Your Honor, is that under the California
government cods, I may have the numbers transversed ?
65950, there is a time limit established under California
law.

An agency can take no more than one year for any k tv,cl

of action such as this, and .is encouraged to .take less
time.

So had the application been'submitted* it could not

have just been suspended indefinitely,

And the penalty for

an agency's failure to act is that the application is
deemed approved by operation of law.
QUESTION;

MR. SHOTE;

After what period of time?
After a one year period.

But that's

on a state-widis basis any kind of project, and there's a
legislative finding which encourages agencies to take an
even shorter period of time.

MR. SHUTSs

Well, Your Honor, I would respond to

30

that iri two ways;
First of all, it seems to me that if there were
any improprieties that occurred in the amount of dedication
or the form of dedication which the city asked for during
the process, then the court would be aware of tha issues
and the legal questions that would be presented, and it could
be litigated following the completion of the administrative
process.
In ether words, if owner's dedication requirements
that ware unreasonable under any standard were imposed, the
owner could litigate that by following the city's action *

don't see how that issue car., be considered before the court

That would have to wait and sea what oc­

And also, the open space process as contssaplatasd

MR. SHUTE:

That i3 what the court held, and its

MR. SHUTS:

So a large part of our position, es I have indi­

of the City of Tiburon was zoned in this manner

not have been automatic even than that they would have re­

MR. SHUTS;

Your Hone r „ I would think tha.'- the

city would be astute and fair enough to realize that if
a good case was made in the planning process, that one home
was totally uneconomic, that they would allow additional
hemes.

I think that's part of the reason and the benefit

of letting this process go forward.
QUESTION;

Either that, or decide maybe to take

the land and pay for it.
MR. SHUTS;

X think we are through with that,, but

possibly yes.
I would just like to mentior,* briefly this remedy
question which has been much briefed.

If the court agrees

with out position that this ordinance is valid on its face,
or that this, case could be considered one where administra­
tive

remedy should, be exhausted, and of course the question

of v?hat • remedy to invoke following an unconstitutional ac­

ti on or an encroachment on private property rights would
not be /'resented'.
But the concept of the remedy to be applied to
regulation is really based on the read to accommodate two
very strong powers? one is the power t.o regulate, which
this court has observed to be one of the least limitable
powers of government»

In fact, local zoning authority has

bean observed to be about the most essential power held by
the local government, and where that power comes into

4.3

conflict with protected property rightsthen there are no
absolutes involved.

What is necessary is to engage in a

balancing, and we submit that the proper balance to be
struck in that circumstance is to invalidate the offend­
ing measure.

That preserves that police power is an ess^rs

tial power and it provides fairness to the property owner
in the sense that a property owner normally does not commenc . development procedure or process with the idea of
having the city end, up buying its property.

H© ccenenoss

that process with fch® idea of commencing some c svelcpment,
a nil validation allows thr.a to go forward with same form of
d eve1comen t.
Also under California law, declaratory relief and
mandate have priority on the court calendar, sc it'a much
fast i- to receive a judicial resolution of these kinds of
conflicts through declaratory relief end mandamus than it
is to go inverse eondesaRation, which can stick arourd on
the trial calendar for a good long time.
Bo xm think it's an appropriate constitutional
balance 'between these two strong interests.

And we subsit

that this court Ihs recognized that essentially the payt

oerpr": atiox* or money damages in a legislative

choice, and that is an i speet of the separation of powers
since legislatures undor our structure of government are
the ones that appropriate and expand public funds..

44
tod in cases which don’t, have to do with the
police power, U.S. Trust v. New Jersey, involving the im­
pairment of bondholders' rights, perhaps somewhat akin to
interference with investment-hacked expectations, as d:tsj

cussed in Penn Central, the court was careful to not© that
while invalidating New 'Jersey's repeal, the State of New
•Jersey was not frustrated in trying to carry out its; new
public policy.

In :would invoke J.-tl power of eminent domain

and compensate effectivo property interests and proceed
with its new policy.
The critical point there is that it was a matter
of legislative choice? not court decree, that compensation
would be paid.

So it was reserved to the legislature as a

lagislative matter.
tod finally I would note, as has been noted in

That, is the exercise of sort of proprietary

direct governmental powers, rot adjusting the public good

I don’t think a

So our point is that in the area of pure regula­
tion, which is intending to adjust the public good, whether
it be an environmental law or some other area, that the
approach should be that if it goes too far under certain
circumstances, it would be an invalid act, precisely be­
cause it‘s unaccompanied by the just compensation that
would be necessary to sustain an invasion of guaranteed
property rights.

That's correct.
Just about this piece of property?

And as it stands now, as it stands now, the supreme court
has said that this ordinance is not invalid even though
or .because the plaintiff can build one to five houses on
hia property, and so who's going to — it could be

anybody who reads; this would think that the ordinance- would

MR. SHOTS;
agree.

Wall, Your Honor,, I respectfully dis­

I think that what the court was saying is a guaran­

teed minimum of one, and anything above that the city might
grant, and taking that as a totality, we think this ordi­
nance is not invalid.

Why don’t you folks go to the plan­

ning department?
QUESTION:

Did the court say that — that is

what troubled me — did the court say that in :>o many
words?

I had ths same impression as ray brother Stewart

that the plaintiffs alleged that this was a taking because,
as applied to their land, because very possibly they - con LI

QUESTION:
and read

But if you were a prospective buyer.

— if somebody came around, and asked you t.o buy

this piece of property and you said, "Well, what can I use
it for?"

Well , you. can either put one to five ~ you cart

either have one house or five houses, up to five houses,
but maybe only one, and you say,

"Well, how am I going to

"Well, somebody*3 going to have to go through

it certainly isn’t a

is it?
MR'.SHUTS s
QUESTION:

Well, X —
Under this soring ordinance, unless

somebody goes- through this-operation and finds out whether
you can build five or four or three?
MR. SHUTS:

That's why I think the allegations of

the complaint are so important.

They allege that this land

has the highest residential land of virtually any land in
the state.

The prospective purchaser looks at chat, and

sees the possibility of up to one unit per acre»

I would

think that looks fairly attractive.
QUESTION:
only have one.

Up to one unit, yes, except he may

He may have one house oh five acres.

QUESTION:

Well, as I read the California supreme

43
court's opinion, again, the vary point that Mr. Justice
White called attention to before:

They review the state­

ments of the appellant here as claiming it deprived the
landowner of all reasonable use of his property, and. then
the court said tills;
"The ordinance before us had no such effect.
According to the wording of the ordinance, the zoning al­
lows plaintiffs to build between one and five residences
on the property."
So the prospectiva purchase?: would know that he
could build one, the supreme court of California having
said so, and that he has an administrative process for a
modification of the zoning with possibly more.
MR.. SHUl'Es

That's correct, Tour Honor.

In fact,

not only this planning process but a modification of the

.lug would always be possible, too, and I think that

I'm not aa appraiser of land —•
Well, that's really what the complaint

is all about here, isn't it?
MU SHUTS:

That's true, but I think the regula­

tory authority is entitled-to say, "Here’s a piece of land
with many variables.

There are hazard conditions tiers,

there ar© possible off-site impacts, and we can’t know in
advance precisely how much density should be allowed, so a
range is provided."

ORAL ARGUMENT BY GIDEON '&ANNER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF TEE APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL
MR. KANNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the court:
A most remarkable: argument.

This is a case in

which a demurrer was sustained,, thereby giving rise to the
traditional Anglo-American issue of purs law.

Yet vir­

tually all we have been arguing about is facts.
QUESTION:

Well, that's perhaps because of the

way you undertook to set this litigation in motion, in­
stead of asking for what is provided tinder the city's
ordinance, an opportunity to get five sites, and you
passed that opportunity and plunged right into the total
litigation,
KABNERs

Well, may I respectfully point out

and call to the court's attention the basic American
seminal case, Euclid v. Ambler, 272 US at page 385, that
very issue was presented and the court said, "A motion was
made in the court below to dismiss the bill on the grounds
that because the complainant had made no effort to obtain
a building permit or apply to the zoning board of appeals
for relief as it might have done under the terms of the
ordinance, the cert was premature.
perly overruled.

The motion was pro-

The effect of the* allegations of the

bill is that the ordinance on its own force operates

greatly to reduce the value of appelle©»5 land and destroy
their marketability for investor or commercial and resi­
dential uses,“
I won't go or. with the quotation.

We were and

still are relying oh that, and it seems to us that the
court would have to overrule not only Necfcow v, Cambridge
but Euclid as well to deprive us of an opportunity to re­
ly on what was until now a clear principle of law.
May I touch on just, a couple of facts.
Mr. Chief Justice, I wanted to make very clear
that in responding to your question, sir, I intended to
indicata that even on® house cannot be built because of
the prohibitive cost of en­ cite improvements.

That is a

large five-acre parcel on a ridge, and in order to prepare it and provide access to it, utilities and so on.
it would be prohibitive.
