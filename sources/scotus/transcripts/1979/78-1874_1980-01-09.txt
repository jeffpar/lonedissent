ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA A. H. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MISS SMITH:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I am Barbara A. H. Smith.

I am Assistant Attorney

General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and I repre­
sent the commonwealth seeking review of an order of the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts which required —•
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I'm not sure that the

amplifying system is working here, Miss Smith.

If you will

just desist for a moment.
Are we functioning now?
MISS SMITH:

Very well, you may proceed.

The commonwealth seeks review of an

order of the Supreme Judicial Court requiring suppression of
a. confession of certain real evidence which was obtained
pursuant to a search warrant based upon that confession and
a subsequent and culpatory statement by the defendant to his
mother.

The basic issue is vrhether the Fifth Amendment

requires such suppression.
I shall limit discussion of the facts to those
surrounding the confession since the legality of the arrest

ii

is not at issue.
The body of the victim was discovered in the early
morning hours of June 11, 1976.

After being informed by

neighbors that they had heard a scream and seen a young man,
approximately five-foot-ten, wearing dungarees and with his
shirtsleeves rolled lip, leaving the scene, the police con­
ducted general inquiries as to young men who were known to
frequent that particular area.

These inquiries took place

at the police station.
One young man said that he kaiew the victim and
that he had seen her sitting on some church steps with a
young man in his teens, with dark hair, who was at that time
shirtless.

Another young man came to the station, one John

Carroll, who told the police that he knew the victim and
that he had seen her on those church steps with Joseph Meehan.
As lie was telling the police this, he looked out the window
and saw Joseph Meehan hitch-hiking on the street outside.
He told the police this, they immediately exited the station,
went to Mr. Meehan, told him of their general investigations
and asked him to accompany them to the police station.
He ap;reed after first noting that he was on his
way to the unemployment office either to pick up his check
or to appeal the denial of benefits.

He accompanied the

police to the station and a Detective Solari began asking
him general questions when he noticed what appeared to him

was blood on the defendant’s sneakers.

He mentioned this

to the defendant who stated, no, it was mud, but that if it
were blood in any event he had gotten the blood in a fight
with one George Quish the previous Tuesday.
%

The detective asked Mr. Meehan for the sneaker and
he gave It to the detective who left the room.

As it hap­

pened, Frank Quish was also being questioned at the station
at this time and he denied having the fight with Joseph
Meehan.

Another officer looked at the sneaker and he con­

cluded that it was blood.

This was later confirmed by the

police chemist that afternoon.
Detective Solari returned to the defendant, advised
him of his rights under Miranda and advised him that he was
under arrest.

At 11:20, Officer Kelley commenced an inter­

rogation of the defendant.

This interrogation was recorded.

The interrogation began \dth the full recitation of the
Miranda rights again, and the defendant responded that he
understood them.

He did respond, "right," "yes," one word

responses, and he agreed to speak about the victim.
The defendant first denied he knew her and then
agreed that he knew her generally, had seen her around town
but that he had last seen her on the previous Tuesday.
is a Friday morning.

This

The officer mentioned the bicod on his

sneakers and the defendant responded that it had come from a
fight on Tuesday.

The officer said it was too fresh to have

6
gotten there on Tueday and the defendant suggested the fresh­
ness was due to the fact that he was swimming the day before
but that he had last seen her on Tuesday.
The officer then advised him that witnesses had
seen them together last night.

He suggested that this was

serious and said, "I think truth is the best thing at this
time, the victim is dead and you are under arrest»"

The

defendant said, "Under arrest for what?" and the officer
said, "For the death, for the murder, and we have witnesses
who saw you together."
The defendant then asked if he could see those
witnesses and the officer declined to do that at that time.
He uhen admitted that he had in fact been with the victim
the previous night, that they had mat in a bar, that they
had two beers, that they discussed getting some pot or
marihuana and that they left the bar around 11:30 or so and
had proceeded to the church steps where they sat for fifteen
or twenty minutes but then that he had. left and the victim
had gone in one direction and he had gone in another.
After some discussion about what the victim had
been wearing at this time, the defendant blurted out, "I was
whacked out last night."

He then talked about having taken

pills, some 15 Valiums of 5 milligrams each, he specified
the milligrams, and that they had been drinking beer, but
he continued to deny that anything had happened between he

7
and the victim.
At this point there is a pause in the interrogation
and another detective suggests that the defendant hd

asked

him what bearing it would have if he told them what had
happened, x^hat degree it would be.

The police responded that

they had no control over that, and Sgt. Kelley responded, "I
can't promise you anything, I have no jurisdiction over any­
thing like that," that he would inform the District Attorney
and the court and defense counsel of cooperation, but said,
"I. can’t say you are going to get a break."

He continued,

"All I can promise you is that I will make your cooperation
known, but again I can’t promise you anything."

He then

continued, "If you wish to tell the truth of what happened,
then I can say in all fairness it will probably help your
defense.

Is there anything else you xvant to know?"
The defendant asked if he could go home and get

some clothes and the officer said that he would get them,
than the police would get them, and then referring to the
drinking of the night before, asked the defendant if he
were still high.

The defendant responded, "A little jiggy9"

but then said that he could understand what was going on.
The officer again said —
QUESTION:

The defendant responded what?

I

didn’t hear you.
MISS SMITH:

His words are "A little jiggy,"

Your Honor.
The officer again asked if he wanted to tell him
iA?hat the story was and the defendant said, "Yes.
tell you, is it going to come out in court?"

But if I

The officer

said it will anyway, we have a good case and my suggestion
is that the truth is going to make a good defense in this
particular case.

The defendant responded, "I don’t know,"

The officer asked, "You don't know what?
tell us about it?"
you?
"Yds."

Do you want to

And then said, "Did you say she provoked

Is that my understanding?"

The defendant responded,

And the officer advised him to tell the story in his

own words and the defendant, stating that he had been high
on Valium and drunk, stated he flipped out when she made
fun of him and then proceeded to confess and describe the
events surrounding the killing.

After the formal arrest.

While this

interrogation was in progress, Officer Solari who had re­
ceived the sneaker from the defendant went to court in order
to secure a search warrant.

While he was there, he was

advised by telephone of the confession and included the fact
of the confession in the affidavit to support probable cause
for the search warrant, admitting the reference to the
bloody sneakers and the other identification of the defendant,

11
a pair of blood-stained dungarees recovered from the de­
fendant ’s home.
At approximately 4:00 p.m., the defendant's mother
and brother arrived at the police station and were escorted
to the defendant's cell.

As they approached he blurted out,

"Ma, I didn't mean to hit her so hard."
The defendant filed a motion to suppress and in an
affidavit stated his grounds, his prior ingestion of alcohol
and drugs and that he did not know that he had a right or a
need of a lawyer and he was frightened.
The Supreme Judicial Court held that the confession
must be suppressed as involuntary and that the dungarees must
be suppressed on the grounds that the confession was involun­
tary and therefore directly offensive to the Fifth Amendment,
and that the afternoon statement must also be suppressed
under the "cat out of the bag" theory.
The common lav/ submits that the lower court has
misconstrued what is constitutionally permissible police
interrogation and it has based its decision on a misconstruc­
tion of the scope and applicability of the Fifth Amendment
privilege to the context of police interrogation.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

1:00 o’clock, counsel.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the court was in recess,
to reconvene at 1:00 o’clock p.m., the same day.)

12
AFTERNOON SESSION — 1:00 O’CLOCK P.M.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Miss Smith, you may

continue.
MISS SMITH:

Thank you.

In holding the confession — as discussed earlier
— holding that that confession must be suppressed, the
Supreme Court of Massachusetts initially referred to that
portion of Miranda which places a heavy burden on the prose­
cution to prove a. knowing and intelligent waiver.

However,

the court continued stating that rather than basing on the
lack of an affective waiver, they found the confession to be
involuntary and directly offensive to the Firth Amendment.
It is the common law’s position that it is the
Fifth Amendment which is deemed to have been offended by the
conduct here, that actual official compulsion or coercion
must be demonstrated, and. that this cannot be accomplished
merely by adding together a number of factors which are not
in themselves coercive.
The factors considered below are relevant to the
question of voluntariness only In establishing a setting in
which actual coercion might have been exerted to overcome
the will of the suspect.
sary:

Thus, two circumstances are neces­

One, an act of coercion by an official and a setting,

and then I believe the compulsion or the pressure exerted by
the police is measured in terms of the setting or the

13
totality of the attendant circumstances in order to deter­
mine whether that act is sufficient to have overcome the will
of a defendant —
QUESTION:

Is it your suggestion that the court

used the wrong standard in arriving at a conclusion that
there was compulsion here?
MISS SMITH:

I believe that the court was of the

view that it was not necessary in a B'ifth Amendment context
to demonstrate any actual compulsion.

They seem to go along

on a view that viewed the conduct of the police In terms of
the age and condition of the defendant and then reached a
conclusion that somehow this isn’t fair and make a leap to
actual compulsion.
QUESTION:
MISS SMITH:

So your answer is ye3 —
Yes.
t

QUESTION:
MISS SMITH:

—- they used the wrong legal standard?
The wrong legal standard, that they

did. not properly apply the Fifth Amendment which by Its own
terras addresses compelled testimony.

And my position is

that actual compulsion -QUESTION:

You don’t think they said we must look

at the totality of the circumstances and then decice whether
his will was overcome by all the circumstances?
MISS SMITH:

They looked at all the circumstances

and the language In the opinion is not that the will was

14
overcome but his ability I believe to make a decision was
undermined.

Now* this I do not believe constitutes compul­

sion or involuntariness as contemplated by the Fifth Amend­
ment .
The factors that the court relied upon are not in
themselves coercive and the police practices involved are
not constitutionally forbidden.

The defendant was 18 years

of age3 he had completed the ninth grade and two years of
high school.

And while it was true he was not specifically

informed of his statutory right to use the phone, he was
twice informed of his right to speak with an attorney and
have: an attorney present with him.

As to his psychological

condition, assuming that he had voluntarily ingested
alcohol and drugs the night before, the defendant also
testified at the probable cause hearing that he had been
using drugs since the age of 14, and it suggested that the
voluntary use of drugs does not allow one to avoid
responsibility for the criminal acts and I suggest that it
does not permit one to avoid accountability for their own
words»

And in this case it can hardly be said that the

defendant was rendered incapable of making a voluntary
decision when the court below found that the defendant had
voluntarily accompanied the police to the station, that he
had voluntarily given up the sneakers.
Moreover, the defendant was sufficiently rational

15
as to have formed an Intent to go to the unemployment office
either to pick up his check or to challenge the denial of
his benefits.

He is quite capable of answering general

questions as to his name, his address, he described the
physical structure of his home.

He was capable of thinking

of rational explanations to explain the condition of his
sneakers.

He corrected Sgt, Kelley on several occasions,

both as to his correct name when the sergeant referred to
him as Robert, he said no, it was Joseph.

He corrected the

sergeant as to the name of the bar he had been in with the
victim, and he questioned the sergeant as to whther it v^as
one or both of his sneakers which were blood-stained.
Moreover, he had sufficient presence of mind to
try to mitigate his conduct by offering the excuse that he
had been whacked out, drunk, and that he flipped out after
the victim had made fun of him.
Moreover, the police testified that he exhibited
no aberrational conduct at the police station, that his
eyas were not glassy, that he had no difficulty in walking.
And I would suggest that the tape supports that view.

In

addition, a doctor who listened to the tape testified that
there were no apparent drug effects.

So there we have

conditions which might, if there were actual coercion, tend
to magnify that coercion Into some kind of unconstitutionally
permissible behavior, but here we have no actual coercion on

16
the part of the police-

They are criticized in addition for

having conducted a skillful

investigation, for making a

misrepresentation as to the number of identifying witnesses.
In Frasier v, Cupp, the defendant was falsely told
that his codefendant had confessed and it was sympathetically
suggested to him that it had been the victim who had pro­
moted the fight that led to the killing.

Neither of these

practices were found to be coercive by this Court, and
neither were held sufficient to render a statement involun­
tary.
A suggestion to tell the truth, especially when
it is not made In a threatening context, does not constitute
coercion under the case law.

Indeed, the Constitution does

not prohibit every element which influences a defendant to
incriminate himself.

If it did, I think we would have to

totally do away with police interrogation.
Finally, the police made no promises to the defencant.

They specifically advised him on more than three

occasions that they could make no promises.

Therefore, we

suggest that in this case there are no acts of official
compulsion, and furthermore that the suggestion that the
concept of police interrogation is in itself inherently
compulsion cannot furnish this necesary factor to a finding
of involuntariness.
In Miranda, in extending the Firth Amendment

17
privilege to the context of police interrogation, the court
posited the factual premise that the police interrogation
was inherently coercive.

The safeguards of the warning

requirements of Miranda were then designed to dispel
inherent coercion.

that

In this case, it is quite clear that

those safeguards were complied with.
of his Miranda warnings.

He was fully advised

Therefore, the inherent compulsion

of police interrogation must be deemed to have been dispelled
and cannot be utilised to provide the necessary factor of
actual official coercion.
The Court generally stated in United States v.
Washington in the context of a grand jury proceeding that
any possible coercion or unfairness resulting from a de­
fendant or a witness’ misimpression that he must necessarily
tell the truth is completely removed by the warnings.

In

this ease, the warnings were fully given.
Also we xtfould suggest that this Court recently
has rejected the factual premise of inherent coercion in
police interrogations.

Primarily in Michigan v. Tucker,

rather than view police interrogation as inherently coercive,
the Court focused on basic traditional Fifth Amendment con­
siderations in finding that the police conduct in Michigan
did not deprive respondent of the privilege against selfincrimination as such, even though there was a disregard of
Miranda.

l3
Wa suggest that if the Court were of the continued
view that custodial interrogation itself supplied the com­
pulsion necessary to involve the Firth Amendment, the ques­
tion of the degree of compulsion . or the particular acts of
the police involved would not arise.
Most importantly, we think that this Court’s de­
cision in cases holding that statements taken involving
violation of Miranda are not per se inadmissible at trial
for all purposes.
In Harris v. New York and Oregon v. Hass, the
Court focused on whether the trustworthiness of the state­
ments satisfied legal standards.

An inquiry into trust­

worthiness, at least under the rule of Rogers v. Richmond,
is irrelevant, that the question is only whether the state­
ments were involuntary.

Therefore, we suggest that if

custodial interrogation itself does not render a statement
invcluntary in a fundamental constitutional sense —

Court that we did find interrogation only to be wrong,

MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:

The Fourteenth.
Miss Smith, at page 21a of the petition

which is part of the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court,

20
towards the bottom of the page, Mr. Justice Kaplan makes a
comment, "Finally., the confession" — and here he is refer­
ring to the second confession of that afternoon — "was
rendered involuntary by police misconduct which cannot be
termed inadvertent."
MISS SMITH:

What is the court referring to there?
The court must foe referring to either

one of two circumstances which they set out as a fartor
leading to their finding of involuntariness:

One, the

police represented that witnesses had identified Meehan as
being with the victim when in fact it is only one witness
which specifically named Meehan, as knowing Meehan as being
with the victim.

The other witness described him as a young

man, he did not know his name.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think the Supreme Judicial

Court then means that any second confession is rendered
involuntary if there has at any stage in the confession
proceeding been police misconduct which cannot be termed
inadvertent?
MISS SMITH:

That is certainly the import of

their decision as far as I understand it, Your Honor.

And

even when the second confession as in this case involved no
conduct whatsoever on the part of the police, it was simply
a spontaneous expression of regret to his mother who happened
to be overheard by the police who were standing in the
«

corridor outside the cell.

There was no police involvement

21
at all in this confession, yet our Supreme Judicial Court
held that it must be suppressed.
QUESTION:

May I ask a question going back to the

first confession and to the Massachusetts court’s opinion
at pages 11a through — I guess it is about page 17a or 18a
— they are discussing the confession and its voluntariness
throughout that period and they rely in that portion of
their opinion on seven or eight different Massachusetts
cases and they stress the fact that under Massachusetts law
the duty to tell the person in custody has a right to
telephone his family is relevant, and they end up by concluding that the trial Judge’s conclusion that the confession
was involuntary was correct.

Can we be positive that that

conclusion is reached entirely independently of Massachusetts
lav/ and, secondly, to what extens should we give any weight
to the violation of the Massachusetts rule about telephoning
when they relied on it as they obviously did?
MISS SMITH:

As to your first question, I think

there is no indication in this case either in the briefs or
argument or in the Supreme Court's decision that it is
based upon the Massachusetts amendment.

Those cases referred

to by the court themselves rely upon Massachusetts interpre­
tation of federal constitutional law.
Now, as to the effect of the failure to warn about
the telephone, that has never been held in Massachusetts to

22

require the suppression of a statement.

And 1 would suggest

that there are eases in this Court which have held that the
violation of a state statute, particularly in terms of
bringing one before a magistrate within a certain period of
time;, does not require or —
QUESTION:

Of course, here the court didnTt hold

that it required exclusion.

They merely held, as I under­

stand them, that it was a factor that must be weighed in
making the voluntariness determination.
MISS SMITH:

Well, I have no quarrel with it as

a factor.
QUESTION:

Would you agree that the failure —

that that is a factor that we should also consider?
MISS SMITH:

As part of the totality of the cir­

cumstances, yes, Your Honor, but —QUESTION:

Because they had the plain duty to

tell him this and they failed to do it.
MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, they do.
Then you would say that if this case

would come here from Rhode Island where there was no such
statute, the factors to be weighed would be different be­
cause nothing would be held against the Rhode Island police
by reason of their failure to inform the defendant?
MISS SMITH:

I think that is true, and I think it

also indicates just how much weight should be given to this

23
factor in the absence of any additional evidence that the
police failed to make this news available to the defendant
in the course of trying to keep him incommunicado position,
I think these factors have to be considered in terms of
what in fact actually happened, what were the police doing»
I mean was there ever any evidence in this case of an intent
on the part of the police to isolate the defendant and to
continue prolonged interrogation of him in that isolated —QUESTION:

You are going to get to your other

point 3 I suppose —
MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:

Immediately.
-- but even if the confession was in­

voluntary 9 the evidence was admissible?
MISS SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

As to the real

evidence, the dungarees, the court below held that they
must be suppressed because the confession was involuntary
and directly offensive to the Fifth Amendment.

Assuming

such a violation, the exclusionary aspect of the Fifth
Amendment does not extend to the instant situation.

The

Fifth Amendment historically and by its terms speaks to the
use of testimony compelled under oath at trial.

Here it is

not testimony that is sought to be used at trial but real
evidence, and the Fifth Amendment does not direct itself
or bar the compulsion of real physical evidence, as evidence
In Schmerber and that line of

cases.

QUESTION:

So you say the fruits of the Fifth

Amendment violation have to be testamentary —
MISS SMITH:

The Fifth Amendment only addresses

itself to one compelled testimonial evidence and it precludes
its use at trials and I would say that it does not address
itself to physical evidence that is sought to be introduced
at trial.

And I think that the suggestion of counsel that

we extend the principle of Counselman v. Hitchcock is with­
out justification.

The underlying considerations of the

privilege in the judicial context are different from here.
And one final point is that even when this Court
has ordered suppression of physical evidence, they focus on
the purpose and flagrancy of police interrogation, and here
the intent was merely to solve an unsolved crime to deter­
mine the truth surrounding a death, and it cannot be said
here, as it was in Spano and Haynes —
QUESTION:

This isn't the first time your court

has decided this, is it?
MISS SMITH:
Honor.

No, Commonwealth v. White, Your

In that case though, that was purely only a Miranda

waiver question.
QUESTION:

It is still a Fifth Amendment question.

MISS SMITH:

Well, only if one views the Fifth

Amendment as totally —
QUESTION:

Well, a fortiori under Commonwealth v.

25
White, a fortiori your point would apply, I suppose.
MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, Your Honor?
It wouldn’t be a fruit if you were —

MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:

I don’t believe it Is a fruit, no.
If it Isn’t a fruit, if physical

evidence gathered by a search warrant using a compelled
confession isn’t a fruit of a Fifth Amendment violation,
surely the same evidence gathered because of the failure to
give Miranda warnings wouldn’t be a fruit.
MISS SMITH:

No, definitely, Miranda wouldn’t be

a fruit because there would be no —
QUESTION:

What happened to that case?

MISS SMITH:

The court summarily affirmed

divided four-to-four last year.
QUESTION:

At least —

MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:

So this question is still open.
At least apparently four people dis­

agree with you though.
MISS SMITH:

Four people did agree with us. too,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

What about the other evidence, the

evidence of fresh blood on some part of his clothing or hi.s
shoes, what happened —
MISS SMITH:

Unfortunately, the police officer

26

He was

He also had the informa­

tion that the victim has been identified as being with Mr.
Meehan.

Unfortunately
QUESTION:

Well, was that evidence ever intro­

duced in this case?
MISS SMITH:
Your Honor.

This case has not gone to trial,

We just had a probable cause heai-ing.

QUESTION:

But has the — I don’t recall the

opinion here — does the opinion address those fresh blood
stains on the shoes?
MISS SMITH:

The opinion notes the blood stains,

yes, Your Honor, and they *—
QUESTION:

You have blood stains in two different

pieces of evidence, don't you?
MISS SMITH:

Right, blood stains on the sneakers

and blood stains on the dungarees that were seised pursuant
to the search warrant.
QUESTION:

May I ask a question in that connection.

The officers not only had the blood stains but they also had,
as you just said, the identification by two witnesses of the
suspect in the neighborhood within a very short time of the
crime.

One of the people who identified him also identified

the young woman and said they were together.

Now, didn’t the

27
search warrant allude to those two identifications?
MISS SMITH:

No, Your Honor.

It talked about the

neighbors’ description of the defendant, and it omitted
evidence which was in the knowledge of the police officer —
QUESTION:

The police had the evidence that the

Chief Justice has alluded to, that is the blood on the shoes
before the arrest -MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:

That's right.
— plus the evidence of these two

witnesses, which would have been abundant to establish
probable cause to search the residence, I vrould have thought.
MISS SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, and the Supreme

Judicial Court noted that they had sufficient evidence,
sufficient probable cause to have obtained the warrant.
MISS SMITH:

So at the very least, isn't this a

plain error case?
MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:
a reasonable doubt.

I’m sorry, Your Honor?
It Just seems to me to be error beyond
The people just left out evidence in

their possession when they drew up the affidavit for the
warrant.
MISS SMITH:

That's simply it, the police could

have come by the dungarees independently of the confession.
They had the probable cause.
QUESTION:

So you are compelled to rely on the

28
confession when appropriate facts were available that would
have justified identifying the dungarees and the underpants?
MISS SMITH:

Yes* Your Honor, there was but the

Supreme Court of Massachusetts ruled that all of the evidence
must be suppressed.

the Fifth Amendment in this case.
MISS SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, that has been the

commonwealthfs contention throughout, that supposedly due
process.

If we agree that the answer is no as to the

dungarees — and this is explained simply on the ground
that the confession was involuntary and thus directly offen
sive to the Fifth Amendment, they then go on to discuss the
conditions In Commonwealth v. White where the finding had
only been the lack of a waiver under Miranda.

QUESTION:

Applying the Fifth Amendment to a

MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:

Pardon, Your Honor?
Appljring the Fifth Amendment to a

state?
MR. MILLS:

I’m sure that the court assumed when

it wrote that, Your Honor, that it was the Fifth Amendment
applicable to the state because of the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Well, what was your position before

the fourt?
MR. MILLS:

Before the lower court, Your Honor*?

QUESTION:

Or this court.

QUESTION:

The highest court of Massachusetts?

QUESTION:

Or the next court.

Are you relying on

the Fifth Amendment?
MR. MILLS:

Well, the Fifth Amendment insofar as

it is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth
Amendment, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Why do you need the Fifth Amendment?

You’ve got due process in the Fourteenth.as applied to a
state and you’ve got opinions of this Court using due process
as applied to the state.

Haley v. Ohio, which you have in

your brief.
MR. MILLS:

Well, because of the Court’s initial

discussion. Your Honor, with respect to involuntariness and

31
Its cases relied upon in that regard, perhaps that is why
the court said what it said.
Before I begin the age of the decedent in the
case, although not appearing precisely on this record,
appeared in the proceedings as both age 23 and 24.

AI30

with respect to the dungarees, there is nothing in the
record to indicate the presence of blood on any clothing
taken from the home of the defendant.

There Is similarly

nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant, when
he vras thumbing a ride on Hyde Park Avenue, was on his way
to anything in the nature of an appeal or a contested
proceeding at the unemployment office.
At the outset, the defendant would like to make
clear that there were not two witnesses who saw him in the
company of the decedent on the evening in question.

The

uncontradicted evidence in a six-day trial before a state
court —
QUESTION:

Are you relying there on the fact that

one of them gave his name, one witness gave a description
which fit him?

Do you mean that only one named him should

be counted?
MR. MILLS:

There was one -witness who told the

police that he saw the decedent and the victim together at
12 o'clock in the evening, Your Honor.

There was another

witness who said he saw a young man, and it is not apparent

32
and it is not clear that the two descriptions coincided
with any precision at all.

There were two descriptions and

the descriptions were different.

The description of the

defendant on the morning when he was in the custody of the
police9 the description that one of the neighbors in the
neighborhood gave the police when she saw someone at 2:00
o’clock in the morning ant the description that a witness
was giving to the police at 11:0.0 o’clock in the morning
are all substantially different, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Mills, pez’haps I misunderstood an

earlier part of your argument.

At 5a again of the petition

for writ of certiorari, which is the Supreme Judicial
Court's opinion, as I read it, and I think I am reading
it correctly, it said he was willing but was going to the
unemployment office and did not want to be late.

I don't

know if that makes any great difference, but the Supreme
Judicial Court said he was on his way to the unemployment
office.
Mil. MILLS:

Significant, Your Honor, that he was

going to the unemployment office.

There is nothing in the

record to indicate that he was going there for the purpose
of a contested appeal or anything that would require his
deliberate attention.
QUESTION:
of difference?

Do you feel that makes a great deal

33
MR. MILLS:

I would not want the Court to he left

with the impression that he was going to a contested appeal
as opposed to picking up ministerially an unemployment check
or something else.
QUESTION:

The court held admissible anything up

until the time he was arrested„ didn’t they?
MR. MILLS:

No, Your Honor, but nonetheless the

condition of the defendant on that day and time he was in­
terrogated is significant -QUESTION:
MR. MILLS:

I see.
-— and that would be a circumstance

in the totality.
QUESTION:

I take it that you are focusing on the

notion that it would take a good deal more perspicacity to
deal with a contested hearing than to pick up a check.
MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:
MR. MILLS:

Precisely, Your Honor.
Is that what you are driving at?
Yes, Your Honor, and there is no

evidence one way or the other.

The uncontradicted evidence

from several xfitnesses is that on the evening and night of
June 10, 1976j this particular respondent ingested some 10
to 15 Valium pills of the 5 milligram variety and also on
the same night ingested 12 containers of beer and also
partook of marihuana that was infected in some way with
some other drug.

In the six-day trial before the state

34
trial judge, a Dr. Greenblat, who was then the Acting Chief
of Clinical Pharmacology at the Massachusetts General
Hospital and a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical
Schoolj was asked a hypothetical question precisely tracking
the evidence as to the mount of chemical ingested by this
particular Individual on the evening.

The medical testimony

and the opinion was with respect to a person’s condition at
11:20 the following morning., that the ingester would experi­
ence drowsiness, sedation, impairment of judgment and impair­
ment of intellectual function.

That was the evidence before

the trial judge tA?hich was apparently believed when matched
with the uncontradicted testimony of the amount of chemicals
that were ingested.

11:20, of course, is precisely the time

which is indicated upon the transcript of the interrogation
as the time that the interrogation started.
QUESTION:

The trier of those issuers could

either believe or net believe his statement about the amount
of drugs and liquor he had ingested.
MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
The doctor’s opinion would of necessity

be on the assumption that those statements were accurate.
MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Did the trier make any findings on

whether those statements were accurate?
MRo MILLS:

By Implication, Your Honor, the trier

35
must necessarily hai^e found the ingestion of drugs and must
necessarily have believed at least part of the medical
testimony of the expert because the same language is re­
cited or substantially similar language is recited in the
memorandum of the trial judge in his order on suppression
of certain of the evidence.
At 11:20 the following morning, a Boston police
detective was in the Hyde Park police station in Boston
interviewing one witness who was also a suspect.

At that

very time that witness said, "And I saw Joseph Meehan in
the

company of the decedent at 12:00 o'clock on the pre­

vious evening-, and coincidentally there he is on Hyde
Park Avenue."
QUESTION:

What did the trial court do with refer­

ence to the motion to suppress the evidence?
MR. MILLS:

The trial court allowed it in part,

Your Honor, and denied it in part»

There were four parts of

evidence before the trial judge on the motion to suppress,
sneakers, a 12:00 o'clock confession, dungarees and clothing
taken pursuant to the search warrant, and a 3:00 o'clock
enculpatory admission.
QUESTION:
MR. MILLS:

The trial judge —

Is that the one to his mother?
Yes, Your Honor, the 3:00 o'clock

statement was to his mother.

The trial judge denied the

motion with respect to the sneakers and the statement to

36
the mothers and allowed the suppression as to the involun­
tary 12:00 o’clock confession and the dungarees that were
taken pursuant to the search warrant.

QUESTION:

The police officer —

If this case comes to trial under the

decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts,
the only evidence against the defendant will be that of the
witnesses who saw him on the church steps with the victim
at midnight on the night on which she was murdered, right?
MR. MILLS:

Yes, Your Honor, and the sneakers

that were taken from him in the police station.
QUESTION:

And the sneakers with the blood stains

on them.
MRo MILLS:,
QUESTION:

Yes,

confronted on the street.

He was

He was not told he was free to

go3 and he was brought back into the police station.
During his interrogation, there were at least
three other police officers present, it appears, at all
times in the room.

The actual interrogation was recorded

on a tape recording machine that was present in the room.
The transcript of that taped proceeding was available to
the trial judge, it was available to the lower court, the
Massachusetts Supreme Court.
appendix to this Court.

It is reprinted in the

The actual tape was available to

the trial judge and it was listened to by him in open
court.

It was apparently listened to by the Massachusetts

Supreme Court and it is part of the record before this Court.
At the conclusion of that interrogation, the
record is silent.

It discloses only that the defendant was

placed in a cell and continued, in detention until the time
that his mother and brother arrived.

The defendant has

bie fed, and I w3ll argue to this Court, three principal
arguments:

First, that the Supreme Court was correct in

excluding the 12:00 inculpatory admission as involuntary
in the totality of the circumstances; second, that the
clothing that wa3 taken from his home

was properly excluded

39
because the search warrant rested on an involuntary con­
fession; ands thirdly, that the 3:00 o’clock inculpatory
admission supposedly made to the mother in the presence of
the police officers should be excluded under the criteria
of Brown v. Illinois and Darwin v. Connecticut.
In determining the issue of involuntarines3, the
court explicitly did not rely upon one of the alternative
theories that had been incorporated in the decision of the
trial judge.

The trial judge found a Miranda violation

and also determined independently that the confession was
involuntary.

The Massachusetts Supreme Court, the lower

court in determining voluntariness, looked to the totality
of the circ’imstanees and did not adopt the Miranda viola­
tion.
The initial confrontation -with the police I have
already mentioned.

I think it is significant to say that

the police were clearly anxious to apprehend
Meehan.

defendant

He weighed 135 pounds and was confronted on the

street by three mature police officers0

He was not told

that he was free to go and the respondent argues to this
Court now that if your decision in Dunaway v. New York had
beer decided at the time the case went to trial on the
issue of suppression, probably an arrest would have been
determined at that time and the sneakers similarly excluded.
During the course of the interrogation and early

40
interview —
QUESTION:

Are you alleging that here there was

an arrest contrary to the finding of your courts?
MRo HILLS:

No, I am not, Your Honor.

The in­

terrogator early on into the interrogation made misrepre­
sentations of fact to the defendant.

In facts I.would use

the word "interrogators” in the plural because although
there was one Sgt. Kelley doing most of the talking, or so
it appears, there were three other police officers intimately
present in this confrontation between a citizen and his
police.

And so to some extent the representations of one

were the representations of four.

And indeed at one point

in the interrogation3 Sgt. Kelley said, "And you could ask
two others who are right here."
The defendant was told that he was seenwith the
decedent by two witnesses on the previous evening.

This

misrepresentation was. repeated at least seven times by the
interrogator.

This misrepresentation was further punctuated

by the representation that the witnesses were positively
sure of their identification and that they had known the
defendant for a long time.

This is inaccurate.

The lower court also concluded that the interro­
gator lied when intimating to the defendant things about
the strength of the government’s case, to the effect that
the case had already been proven against him.

The interrogator also misrepresented to the de­
fendant , "We are here to help and the truth is going to be
a. good defense in this particular case»"
QUESTION:

Did the defendant also lie as to his

encounter with Quish?
MR. MILLS:

There is some indication that there

were contrary representations by Quish, Your Honor.

There

is no testimony to that effect in the record, I don’t believe.
So initially the defendant suggested the oases of
this Court have noted misrepresentation of fast as one of
the criteria in the totality of determining involuntariness.
Secondly, or thirdly, promises were made by the
police interrogator to the defendant 'while he was in custody,
during the interrogation in express terms, Sgt. Kelley told
the defendant that a confession would help the defendant in
the defense of the charge.

It is suggested that Sgt. Kelley

made personal assurances as well as his, the police interro­
gator’s personal intervention with the law in the matter of
this case.

Sgt. Kelley said, "I will bring it to the atten­

tion of your attorney, the District Atrorney, the local
court judge and right up the line."
QUESTION:
false statement?

Well, can one be sure that that was a

In other words, if the police had some

of the evidence that your opposition describes and they ask
for the

-search warrant so that they felt they had a strong

case without the confession, might not the sergeant's state­
ment have been perhaps not good advice but not necessarily
false?
MR. MILLS:

It was a promise of leniency, Your

Honor, and a promise and inducemtn and its truth or falsity
in this context as an inducement and a promise and a reward
is immaterial, truth or falsity we suggest is immaterial.
It might also be a misrepresentation which would be another
factor in the totality.

But I suggest that that promise of

personal intervention was an inducement by the police
officer which has been prescribed by this Court in Malloy
v. Eogan —
QUESTION;
MR. MILLS:

But not by itself.
Not by itself, and at no point does

the respondent argue that any one individual factor in
this case is a factor by itself which would —
QUESTION:

And didn't they also say at least

three or more times that, you know, we can't do anything
about that?

Is that true?

MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:

The psychological —
Is that true?

Of course, it is true

because it is In the record.
MR„ MILLS:

Yes, Your Honor.

But on pages 22

and 23 of the respondent's brief, that particular promises
speech which was intimately examined by the trial judge and

we suggest intimately examined as is reflected by the
Massachusetts Supreme Court’s opinion is interspersed with
promises and rewards and all to the alternating dynamic of
”we can’t promise you anything but we will give you the
world, we can’t pj.'omise you anything but I will go to the
District Attorney,, I can’t promise you anything but it helps
in cases like this,”

This was precisely the type of dynamic

that was focused in by the trial judge in determining that
the will of this individual had been overborne by the police
promises.
Both lower courts relied upon the evidence of in­
toxication and the impaired psychological condition of this
respondent at the time of his interrogation.

In addition

to the drugs, the uneontradicted evidence of much drug in­
gestion and alcohol ingestion on the evening of the 10th,
there was also evidence of the ingestion of four or five
milligram Valium capsules at 10:30 in the morning of June

11, 1976.
I would like to not fail to bring to the attention
of the Court that in addition to what I have already argued
with respect to intoxication, the interrogators were aware
of the drug ingestion and on three separate occasions during
the course of the interrogation the defendant brought that
message to the interrogators, that he had taken the Valium,
that he was geeling jiggy, and that he was confused.

QUESTION:

You said that they were aware of it.

They were only aware of it to the extent that he told them.,
right?
MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
The interrogation was on the 11th,

was it?
MR. MILLS:

Correct, Your Honor, apparently at

11:20 in the morning.
QUESTION:
MR. MILLS:

And that was the day after the —
That would have been about twelve

hours after the wholesale ingestion of the chemicals and
it would have been about

Both of the

courts, the trial court and the

lower court noted the age of the respondent.
he was 18 years old.

At the time

His poor educational background and

his lack of worldly experience which have all been —
QUESTION:
MR. MILLS:

How much high school did he have?
Two floundering years as indicated

by his high school record. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

He had ten grades then.

He wasn't

a fourth grader or -~
MR. MILLS:

Nine grades. Your Honor.

I believe

it was to the ninth grade.
QUESTION:

Well, might not worldly experience

'46
have been a substitute for high school education?
MR* MILLS:

Yes, and he had none, Your Honor.

Both courts found that he had no worldly experience.

He

had been only out of his own neighborhood overnight on two
or three occasions.
QUESTION:

Do you mean by worldly experience a

trip to Florence?
(Laughter)
MR. MILLS:

Perhaps someone from Hyde Park,

Massachusetts, Your Honor, a trip into Boston would be
some indication of more worldly experience than a life
pretty much confined to a single rather sociological
deprived neighborhood in Boston, and so both of the lower
courts looked at this and considered it a factor.
QUESTION:

Sometimes people who know their way

around to get prohibited drugs are called street wise.
Would you say that he was street wise?
MR. MILLS:

Hot on this record, Your Honor, and

apparently both of the lower count's also felt that way*
QUESTION:

Any evidence that these drugs were

given by prescription?
MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:

None at all, Your Honor.
So we can assume he got them the way

drug users usually get them.
MR. MILLS:

There is testimony in the transcript

47
as to how he got them, Your Honor.

He got them from two

other of his young friends in an automobile the same night.
QUESTION:

Well, that is what I thought was

called street wise.
MR. HILLS:

Perhaps a type of street wise, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Is there any testimony about prior use

of drugs?
MR. MILLS:

There was testimony in the form of

hypothetical questions to a state medical expert on the

examination of the defendant.

There was some cross-

There was, the respondent

tells you and suggests to this Court, nowhere near the
evidence in the proceeding below as was made the subject
of hypothetical questions to the state5s medical witness.
There was some, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Weil, then I think there was evidence

in any ease that there was 15 Valium or whatever it. was,
and there was some question of "is that as much® you
usually take” or something like that, or something along
those lines, indicating a period of habit or use.
MR, MILLS:

The lower court also paid significance

as c. single factor in the totality of the fact that the
defendant was not even forthwith the information as to
his right under Massachusetts statute to use the

telephone.

On all of these factors, both Massachusetts courts concluded
the Involuntariness and in the Massachusetts Supreme Court
did that unanimously.
The state has suggested in its petition and in
its arguments to this Court that there should be some
further active act of official coercion In the nature of
Injection of truth serum or the active use of hypnosis in
order to be a prerequisite to the finding of involuntariness,
and the respondent suggests that such is not consistent with
the applicable opinions of this Court.
With respect to the clothing that was taken from
the defendant's house, the respondent notes that there is
no case of this Court that it can cite which is precisely
on all fours with the ease that is now before the Court»
However, In a series of cases which begins with Counselman
v. Hitchcock in 1892 and continues to suggest, and I have
included in the brief the five cases, concluding with
Manc.ujano in 1976, although each of the cases deals in the
context of this Court's examination of an immunity statute
and the scope of an immunity statute, the language is ex­
plicit that the fruit or derivative evidence of Fifth
Amendment violation shall be excluded, and it is on this
basis that the respondent has argued the propriety of the
Massachusetts Supreme Court's exclusion of the dungarees.
QUESTION:

Yes, I believe it would be admissible.
Well, is It the law of the case that

it was not a violation of Miranda?
MR. MILLS:

The Massachusetts Supreme Court pre­

ferred to rest, the language of the court —
QUESTION:

I understand that, but that isn’t

how about my question?
MR. MILLS:

I don’t think it decided, Your Honor.

51
QUESTION:

That is what I wanted to know.

Is It

still open, that question?
MR. MILLS:

It would be open for a matter of re­

hearing before the Massachusetts Supreme Court on the
Miranda issue.
QUESTION:
MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:
it?

Miranda wasn’t Fifth Amendment?
Excuse mes Your Honor?
Miranda wasn’t Fifth Amendment, was

In this case, this is a Fifth Amendment case you said.
MR. MILLS:

Miranda is not in this case, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Are any of the cases that you rely on

in this Court Fifth Amendment cases, confessions held out
because of the Fifth Amendment?
MIL MILLS:

Well, the criteria in federal cases
X

_

applied by this Court, yess Your Honor.
QUESTION:

My point was have you got a United

States Supreme Court case that says a state in administer­
ing its criminal laws is obliged to follow the Fifth Amend­
ment ?
MR. MILLS:

I believe that when this Court made

the Fifth Amendment applicable to the states through the
Fourteenth Amendment, I thought that that is what it did,
Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, 1 am asking you not what you

52
thought.

I am asking you do you have a case that this

Court said the granting of a portion or not excluding a
confession is a violation of the Fifth Amendment if done
by a state,
MR. MILLS:

To the extent that it may be said.

In Malloy v. Hogan I believe, yes.
QUESTION:

The standard said so.

QUESTION:

Well, it couldn’t have said so, if I

may differ with my brother.

It might have been the Fifth

Amendment as incorporated In the Fourteenth against state
action.
MR. MILLS:

Without being perhaps said explicitly,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

It went beyond that.

It said the

precise test under the Fourteenth Amendment as to a state
is vhat it is under the Fifth Amendment as to the -federal
government.

Thatis what it held, that is what it said.

MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:

Right.
That is not what this case said.

This

case said the Fifth Amendment, and I can't find the Fourteenth
Amendment in any of the opinions or the briefs.
MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:

Perhaps I intended to —
But I cannot operate on what you in­

tended , I'm sorry.
MR. MILLS:

May I proceed to the third argument,

53
Your Honor.

The third argument Is that the 3:00 o’clock

Inculpatory admission made to the mother should be excluded
on the principle of Brown v„ Illinois and Darwin v.
Connecticut.

The evidence and the facts with respect to

the third argument of the respondent before you is simple.
He was taken to a cell and detained.

At some point his

mother and a brother arrived at the police station and
they were escorted to his cell, despite their requests to
be left alone with the defendant, they were not allowed
that.

And I might add nor was an attorney who eventually

arrived at the police station allowed to be alone to confer
with his client.
At that point -QUESTION:

Does that affect the case, any

evidence in the case?
MR. MILLS:

I believe that it is a criteria that

the court may lock at in determining the attitude of the
police throughout the confrontation that began on Hyde Park
Avenue, Your Honor, and ended at the point where his attorney
left the station late that night.
QUESTION:

And who was present when he said to

his mother, "I didn*t intend to hit her so hard,'’ or who
was present then?
MR. MILLS:
three police office3?s.

There were at least two and perhaps
The evidence Is somewhat

54
contradictory --- not contradictory, but it was different.
There is at least one Peeney, there could be also Madden
and one of the witnesses testified that there were three
other police officers, two of them in plain clothes.
There is nothing to indicate a break in the
stream of events, and with respect to this 3:00 o*cloek
afternoon statement the respondents suggest that the
language of this Court in Brown v. Illinois is particularly
appropriate when this Court suggested that the later incul­
patory admission that had been made by Brown in that case,
that his initial inculpatory admission vitiated any incen­
tive on his part to avoid self-incrimination.
In Meehan, in this case, in the context of his
involuntary remarks made during the interrogation that was
tape recorded, had confessed to first degree murder.

What

more heinous matter under Massachusetts law could vitiate
any incentive on the part of a person in custody to avoid
further self-incrimination.
QUESTION:

But suffice it to say —

What Is the sentence on conviction

for first degree murder in Massachusetts?
MR. MILLS:
QUESTION:

Life in prison, Your Honor.
With or without the possibility of

parole?
MR. MILLS:

Without parole, Your Honor.

And

using the criteria of Darwin v. Connecticut and Brown v.

55
Illinois, there was no break In circumstances between the
time that he was interrogated initially, with the confes­
sion found to be involuntary

and this later inculpatory

admission.
QUESTION:

Mr. Mills, I didn’t want to interrupt

you until your time was up.

It is a fairly minor point.

On page lia. again of the petition, which is the Supreme
Court opinion, there is a footnote that says, ”The defendant
has not briefed or argued certain assignments of error and
they are considered waived»"

Were any of those federal

constitutional arguments?
MR. MILLS:

I don’t believe so. Your Honor.

I

briefed and argued the case in the state Supreme Court,
but I don’t believe that I waived any federal constitutional
arguments.
QUESTION:

Well, the Supreme Court felt you had

waived some arguments by not briefing or arguing them.

What

I am curious to know is if you know now whether they were
federal constitutional arguments®
MR. MILLS:

I do not know.

Under our practice,

if an assignment is not made it cannot be briefed.

Once

you come to the point of finally choosing three or four
issues that are significant or chosen to be significant,
those that are not then briefed and argued have been waived
under Massachusetts practice.

56
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, Miss Smith,

Thank you, Mr. Mills,

The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 1:55 o’clock p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
