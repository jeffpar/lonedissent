MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-1557, Nachman Corporation v. Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation.
Mr, Gettleman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. GETTLEMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GETTLEMAN:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I am Robert Gettleman and I am the

attorney for the petitioner, Nachman Corporation.
This case presents one of the first opportunities
for this Court to examine the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 197^, known by its acronym ERISA, and the
first occasion directly Involving interpretation of
specific exceptions to that statute.
Significantly, It Involves the operation of
ERISA at

its initial stages.

The Nachman Corporation

was an employer whoch terminated a pension plan in
December of 1975, ancl which under the terms of that plan
was not required to continue to fund any more payments
under the terminated plan.
Prior to ERISA, Nachman was governed, by the
Internal Revenue Code and the common law of contracts,
and those laws allowed an employer to do just what Nachman

5
did, terminate a plan and under its terms not be liable
for further contributions.

The issue in the case is

whether ERISA prior to 1976 changed the rules to require
an employer such as Nachman to continue to fund the plan.
The case requires an examination both of the terms of
ERISA itself and of the various provisions of the plan.
And first I would like to just briefly describe ERISA.
That statute was enacted in September of 197*4
as an attempt by Congress to cure many of the problems
which were plaguing private pensions in this country at
that time.

Among those problems was the issue involved

when a plan terminated with insufficient funds to pay all
the benefits under the plan.
In Titles I and II of ERISA, and it was a fourtitle Act, the statute prescribes for the first time that
a plan must provide a certain minimum level of benefits
and that these benefits have to be what was defined in the
Act as non-forfeitable benefits.

That means unconditional

and legally enforcible benefits.

It also provided that

the employer must undertake to fund those benefits«
In Title IV of the Act, ERISA established a
termination insurance program to be operated by the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the respondent in this case
today.
QUESTION:

Do you equate that statutory language

6
legally enforcable to mean legally collectable?
MR. GETTLEMAN:

Under the facts of this ease. I

think that they are synonymous because the rights under
the particular plan that Nachman had with its employees
were not enforcable or collectable because of the various
provisions of the plan which made — which precluded further
employer liability, which allocated benefits on termination
in a particular type of order, and benefits that are at
issue in this litigation, Mr. Chief Justice, are those
benefits which were not funded.

There were benefits

which were funded under the Nachman plan and to that ex­
tent we are not in litigation.
the unfunded benefits.

We are only talking about

They were neither collectable

nor enforcable nor unconditional and they did not meet
the statutory term of non-forfeitable or the statutory
definition of that term.
And it is important to remember that the PBGC
guarantees under Title IV only non-forfeitable benefits
under the terms of a plan.

And it is also important to

recognize, as this Court has done, that Congress when it
enacted ERISA paid great attention to the types of
problems which would be created by the new requirements
of this statute.

It did not make the entire statute ef­

fective immediately but provided grace periods during
which certain provisions

would be phased on before

7
compliance was required,

Among those provisions was the

minimum benefit provisions of Titles I and II and the
non-forfeitability requirement of Titles I and II„

Those

provisions did not take effect until plan years beginning
in January 1976.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gettleman, is it your position

that after January I, 19769 an employer and a union could
not negotiate a plan ±r. which disclaimed personal liability
/

on the part of the employer —
MR. GETTLEMAF:

Basically, yes.

Basically, yes.

The Internal Revenue Service has dealt with types of
limitation clauses which might be permissible even after
1976«,

There is no question that the type of clauses in

the Nachman plan would not have been permitted after 1976.
QUESTION:

But how about a specific disclaimer

of liability on the part of the employer as opposed to the
plan?
MR. GETTLEMAF:

No, that would not have been,

that would not have been allowed.
QUESTION:

Ycu say after January 1, 1976, that

is not permissible?
MR-. GETTLEMAN:
right.

That is not permitted, that's

The General Motors Plan ~~ they are an amicus on

behalf of the respondent — and some other plans apparently
have limited liability to the assets of the plan or to

8
the PB3C guarantee, which means basically that all of the
protections of Title IV are incorporated by reference
into the plan.

But the type of limitation clause or dis­

claimer clause that we had would not have been permitted,
which was basically a general disclaimer.

We are obligated

to pay a certain amount into the plan and after that we
have no further liability.

That is no longer allowed.

This case arises because the non-forfeitability
requirements were effected in 1976, but the termination
insurance program went into effect upon enactment in 197^.
The difference between those two dates really raises the
issues which are presented in this case.
I would like just briefly to discuss the plan.
I have already discussed it somewhat, but I would like to
go back a bit and discuss the type of plan we have here
be fore the Court.
It was established in i960 for certain employees
of Nachman’s North Chicago plant as a part of the collec­
tive bargaining agreement between Nachman and United Auto
Workers which represented those employees.

United Auto

Workers is an intervening party in this case.

It was

part of a package of wages and non-wage compensation bar­
gained collectively between the parties to this plan.
was

what was known as a combined benefit plan and it

provided various normal retirement benefits, that is

It

9
benefits that would be payable upon the reaching of normal
♦

retirement age, in this case 65s as well as certain early
benefits and disability benefits.
It required the employer to make contributions
annually into the plan based upon an actuarial table which
contemplated that if the plan remained in existence thirty
years and if that level of benefits was maintained, all.
benefits in the plan would be fully funded, and the reason
that all benefits in this type of plan were not fully
funded immediately is because the contributions were based
on hours worked.

Contributions based upon current service

were paid currently; contributions based upon services
rendered before the establishment of the plan were based
upon a thirty-year amortization schedule.

This is still

permissible under ERISA.
Unfortunately, however, Nachman was compelled
to close its plant for economic reasons in 1975, after
only fifteen years, and therefore terminated the plan»
It did so lawfully.

There is no question or contest that

it did anything improper in terminating the plan»

It

obeyed the terms of the plan which governed the rights of
the parties upon termination.

One of them is a term I

mentioned in response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question
and that is it was a normal type of what was called a
disclaimer clause, but it said more than just we disclaim

10

any further liability.
Article V of the plan told the employees that
they could not look any further than the assets in the
plan at the time it terminated to get their benefits.
QUESTION:

Well, those two are the same, to say

we disclaim any personal liability and to say you couldn't
look any further than the assets In the plan.

There is

no difference between those two.
MR. GETTLEMAN:

I think it goes a little further

than just saying that, than just saying we disclaim any­
more liability.

It says to the employee, your benefits

will be paid from the assets, and part of the Issue and
part of the Seventh Circuit’s dissertation on the defini­
tion of non-forfeitable contained in the statute vras that
these'were not claims that could be asserted against the
plan.

We say that that clause says both that you cannot

assert a claim against the employer or the plan, but
there are other provisions in the plan, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, which govern the rights of the parties upon
termination.
Article IX of the plan provides that It was
allowed to be amended to comply with changes in the law
but that no such amendment would affect the level of con­
tributions required of the employer under the terms of
the plan.

This was obviously for the benefit of both the

11
employer and the employees, and it protected the integrity
of the bargain between those parties.
Article X of the plan governed termination and
allowed either side to terminate upon 60 days' notice but
not during the term of a collective bargaining agreement,
again an effort to protect the integrity of the collective
bargaining agreement ard the collective bargaining process„
QUESTION:

Mr, Gettleman, could I ask you a

question while you are going through the plan here because
it may bear on what you are saying.

Supposing the termin­

ation occurred a year later, in January of 1977, and at
that time I would suppose there would still be the sameprovisions in the trust agreement to the pension plan and
it would still be unfunded, some of the benefits xrould not
be funded.

Would the insurance coverage apply then?
MR. GETTLEMAN:

To answer the question directly,

yes, but the-plan would have been amended in 1976.
QUESTION:

The statute x^ould have requli-ed it?

MR. GETTLEMAN:

Yes, because at that time all

plans were required to provide a non-forfeiture benefit.
These types of provisions would have been amended out and
plans all over the country employed many lawyers amend­
ing these provisions during that period of time.
QUESTION:

And they would have been ©.mended out

whether the collective bargaining agreement provided for

12

such amendment or not, wouldn’t they, simply by force of
Congress’ action?
MR. GETTLEMAN:

That’s right»

At that time

the congressional direction overrode the contract between
the parties, but not until that time, and our plan termin­
ated before that time and that is really the point of this
whole case.

Our plan and obviously some others terminated

prior to 1976.
There is just one other provision

of the plan

that I would like to mention briefly and that is that
when the plan terminated, an allocation schedule was set
up in Article X which divided the assets according to six
categories of employees, basically the oldest first, those
getting benefits at the time of termination, those eligible
to receive normal retirement benefits, and on down.
When a category was reached for which there
w<re insufficient assets, the assets were distributed pro
rata to that category and there were no further rights to
receive any other benefits under the plan.

I think it is

important to emphasize that this was a legal, lawful tax
qualified IRS approved pension plan at the time it termin­
ated.

It met all of tie provisions of the governing law.
QUESTION:

Sc you would be making your same

argument between two plans if one is terminated the day
before the deadline and one is terminated the day after,

13
but things are just different?
MR. GETTLEMAN:

That's right, and that is ex­

actly what Congress intended.

That is precisely what

Congress intended.
QUESTION:

Even though the relative burden on

the company is exactly the same?
MR. GSTTLEMAN:

But the company had the oppor­

tunity to adjust to the new requirements„
QUESTION:

You only had a day.

MR. GETTLEMAN:

No, no.

Your Honor, this is a

l6~month period between enactment and the effective date
of these requirements and during that time our collective
bargaining agreement expired and we were allowed to ter­
minate the plan»

it is important to keep in mind that our

plan was terminated practically at the earliest date we
could have because on September 2, 197^, when ERISA was
enacted, we were right in the middle of a three-year col­
lective bargaining agreement which expired in October of
1975QUESTION:

And when did this plan expire, during

the grace period?
MR. GETTLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

So you are still saying there is a

difference between the day before the grace period is over
and the day after?

MR. GETTLEMAN:
November 1st.

Yes.

We could have picked

We picked the last day of the grace period

for administrative convenience and to make our lives
easier, I suppose.

But it was in 1975 and that was the

operative fact.
I think it is also important to emphasize once
again that this was a collectively bargained plan.

The

employees were represented by a major union in this country
and certainly had no right or no reason to expect anything
other than what the plan provided.

They certainly had no

reason to expect prior to ERISA that the employer would be
liable to continue to fund this plan after termination.
That is what they bargained for, that is what they got.
When the plan terminated, vrhich was not a par­
ticularly happy event for- anybody because the plant closed
down, when the plant terminated there were approximately
$575,000 which had been contributed by Nachman over the
fifteen years.

This sum was enough to pay everybody who

was receiving benefits and everybody who had worked for
Nachman ten years who was over the age of 60.

Below that

category, however, there is no question that there were
insufficient assets to pay the remaining benefits.

And

again, there is no question that had this plan survived
that other day, it would have been required to provide a
truly non-forfeitable benefit, but it is just as clear

15
that prior to 1976 it v’as not required to provide a non­
forfeitable benefit.

And since the Pension Benefit

Guaranty Corporation insures only non-forfeitable benefits
and the employer is liable to the PBGC to reimburse them
for any benefits so insured and actually paid by them, the
issue then is whether these benefits were non-forfeitable
under the terms of the Nachman plan.
The District Court held that they were not, that
they were forfeitable and properly forfeited.

The Court

of Appeals disagreed, and this Court granted certiorari
limited to the interpretive issue.

We also raised a con­

stitutional question but the grant of certiorari was
limited only to the interpretive issue.
As I mentioned, a term is defined in the statute
itself as unconditional, and legally enforcable against
the plan.

Our position really is very simple.

We contend

that a benefit which was conditioned upon the sufficiency
of assets at termination was by definition conditional and
therefore for that reason alone not non-forfeitable„

We

also claim that under the provisions of the plan which 1
have described, the rights at issue in this case could not
be enforced against either the plan or the employer.

To

be unforfeitable, a benefit must be both unconditional and
legally enforcable.

We are neither.

If we were not just

one of those, we would be forfeitable and therefore not

16
Insured by the PBGC and. therefore the employer would not
be liable to the PBGC.
The respondents in this ease would rather look
instead to the statutory definition to PBGC's own defini­
tion contained in a regulation promulgated about a year
after ERISA was enacted, in September 1975-

Thie defini­

tion provides in effect that a benefit becomes non­
forfeitable when the employee satisfies all the conditions
imposed upon him.

It makes no mention whatever, however,

of the statutory requirement that the benefit be uncondi­
tional and legally enfcrcable.

We claim that that defini­

tion is invalid because it contradicts the statutory
definition.

We claim it is inxralid because it is unneces­

sary because Congress provided its own definition of this
term in very clear and unambiguous language.
And even more important, we claim that their
definition and in fact their whole position in this ease
is improper and would result in the immediate imposition
of liability on Nachman Corporation and employers like
Nachman Corporation on the date of enactment of ERSA in
September 1971’.

I think that it is very clear that, al­

though Congress certainly intended to prohibit types of
limitation of clauses we had, they just as clearly in­
tended to provide prospective, effective dates and not to
impose immediate and retroactive liability.

Yet the Court

17
of Appeals in its opinion concedes that its ruling does
result ixi a retroactive effect on Nachman Corporation,,
This Court has, although not dealt with ERISA
directly as in this case, it has compared ERISA to certain
other situations which resulted in retroactive changes to
pension plans.

The first such case was City of Los Angeles

v. Manhart, at ^35 U.S. , in which Justice Stevens, writing
for a unanimous Court, found that although a Title VII
violation had occurred by compelling women to pay more
into a pension plan than men because they lived longer,
that a retroactive remedy was inappropriate in that case
for several reasons.

One of those reasons was the drastic

effect that retroactively Imposed rules or remedies would
have on pension plans, because pension plans were for the
future, they look to tie future.

They make contributions

and obligations based upon future expectations.

To impose

retroactively a burden or a remedy on them had drastic
effects, and I quote from page 721 of that opinion *—
after going through that, Justice Stevens wrote:

"Conse­

quently, the rules that apply to these funds should not
be applied retroactively unless the legislature has. plainly
commanded that result,’’

And at that point the opinion

cites to ERISA as an example of an instance where Congress
did not want retroactive application to a pension plan.
And I quote again:

13
"In 197^j Congress underlined the importance of
making only gradual and prospective changes in the rules
that govern pension plens.

The bill" — citing ERISA —

"The bill paid careful attention to the problem of retro­
activity and set a wide variety of effective dates for the
different provisions and cites to the exact sections of
ERISA which we rely upon in this case, namely that sections
which are in 29 U.S.C., section 1061 and 1086, those are
the sections that provide the 1976 effective dates."
QUESTION:

Mr. Gettleman, do you suppose when I

wrote that footnote I contemplated the issue that is before
us now?
MR. GETTLEMAN;

Mo, Your Honor, but you recognise

the congressional intent that we rely upon in this case0
That was Title VII.
QUESTION:

That wasn't the proposition, that

there are staggered dates in ERISA, of course there are
a lot of other staggered dates in ERISA.
MR. GETTLEMAN:
cisely the point.
immediately.

That's right, but that is pre­

Congress didn't make the act effective

They didn’t make the more burdensome pro­

visions of that act ~~
QUESTION:

They did make one thing effective

immediately, Mr. Gettleman, and that is the insurance pro­
gram.

19
MR. GETTLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

What does that Insure during the

period prior to the date of your termination of the plan?
MR. GETTLEMAN:

It insures by definition the

same thing it insures after that date, non-forfeitable
benefits under the terms of the plan.
QUESTION:

Is the purpose just to insure against

the possibility that the money contributed to the fund will
have been dissipated or stolen by the trustees?
MR„ GETTLEMAN:

No, most

funds, you must assume

— and I think it is true —- are operated honestly and the
reason that there was Insufficient funding was because of
this past service liability, the contributions for the
years before the establishment of a plan were substantial.
QUESTION:

You are not talking about the risk of

dissipation of funds or maybe poor investments.

What did

the insurance program insure?
MR. GETTLEMAN:

Okay.

During that period of

time, we know from an affidavit filed in the District Court
by the PBGC itself that there were —■ I am trying to get
the exact number — 136 plans which terminated during the
grace period which had insufficient assets upon terminatione
Forty-three percent of those plans had non-forfeitable
benefits, even though they weren’t required to at that
time they provided them.

They did not have the limitation

20

clauses which we had in our plan and which the remaining

57

percent had in their plans.
There is $20 million worth of benefits insured

under that program during the grace period. 0

We think it

liras a significant role that the PBGC played during the
grace period.

After the grace period,, all plans were

required to provide non-forfeitahle benefits and all
plans and all benefits which were non-forfeitable as they
were required to be were therefore insured.
The PBGC during the grace period also had to
set premiums.

It was a brand new agency.

It had to get

established and set its housekeeping regulations.

So

when you put Title IV and Titles I and II together, It
demonstrates a cohesive scheme to get this program roll­
ing to give people time to adjust, not to impose retro­
active liability, not to impose immediate and substantial
liability on employers which had never bargained for and
never expected to and perhaps could not pay that type of
price.
QUESTION:

Let me ask one other question, if

I may, on the plans that were terminated during the inter­
val before the date here and after the enactment of the
act.

You say about half of them or whatever the figure

was had non-forfeitable benefits.
MR. GETTLEMAN:

Yes.

21
QUESTION:

Did they also have provisions in them

that the employer was liable for the full amount of the
benefits —
MR. GETTLEMAN:

They did not limit the employer’s

liability.
QUESTION:

Then if that were true, I still don’t

see why you needed insurances because —
MR. GETTLEMAN:
insufficient assets.
QUESTION:

Becu se they terminated with

Those plans terminated —
If they terminated, wouldn't there

be liability on the part of the employer?
MR. GETTLEMAN:

There would but the employer,

one, could be insolvent; two, there was a 30 percent
limitation —QUESTION:

The risk being insured against was

the insolvency of employers whose plans would terminate
when there i<K)uld be an obligation to pay the full amount
of the benefits?
MRc GETTLEMAN:
Honor.

More than just that. Your

The termination insurance program provides an

easily accessible uncostly efficient administrative scheme
to pay pension benefits to the average employee of a plan»
If a plan were to terminate and the employer for one reason
or another denied liability or didn’t have the money or
wanted to stall, they could go to the PBGC and get their

22
pension benefit, and it was up to the PBGC to go after the
employer under the statutory subjugation.
ease today.

That is the

That is the case today, because even though

the plan must provide a. non-for felted benefit It still
needs to fully fund the plan on a current basis.

And

even today an employer can go out of business — not go
out of business — an employer could terminate a plan if
he has a right to do sc, and if he goes out of business
and is insolvent, the employees go to the PBGC.

Even if

he is not, the employees can go to the PBGC.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you one other — maybe I

~~ I don’t mean to be unfair, but there is reference in
the legislative history to the termination of the Studebaker
plan in South Bend, I think.
MR. GETTLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I think there is some evidence of

intent that that situation should have been covered.
Would you agree that ycur reading of the statute would
cover that plan?
MR. GETTLEMAN:
plan.

I have never read the Studebaker

It occurred in 1963, I believe, and a large number

of —
QUESTION:

That was a case of insolvency of the

employer, I think.
MR. GETTLEMAN:

I don’t believe so.

1 believe

23
it had a limitation — I believe that plan had a limitation
clause similar to ours and the legislature said to both
employers and employees or at least employees unions, be­
cause we have to assume that they were represented by the
unions as well, we are not going to let you limit liability
to the employer any more.

But they didn't say we are not

going to let you do that upon enactment.

They said we are

not going to let you do that after 1976.
QUESTION:
your analysis?

Well, why are unions so critical in

I mean, couldn’t a private individual,

simply an employee who was not represented by a union have
a contract for a pension plan that vvould be affected by
ERISA?
HR. GETTLEMAN:
affected ?jy it equally.

Certainly.

Today they are all

There are different rules for

proprietorships and partnerships which do not: relate to
this case.

With respect to corporate plans, there are

even some different rules for collective bargaining plans.
Some dates are extended even beyond the 1976 date for
collectively bargained plans.
But vie think the fact that this was collectively
bargained really relates to the basic thrust I think of
our opponents’ argument and much of the congressional
concern that these may have been either, unilaterally im­
posed or that they promised illusory benefits.

We don’t

24
think our plan promised anything that wasn't the subject
of arms length bargaining between the employer and
employee, and to the extent that there is an equitable
argument on the other side we think it doesn’t apply to
a collectively bargained plan such as the Naehman plan.
I would just like to take one more minute and
reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal, and that is to
mention that the language of the Manharfc which I have
quoted was also quoted in the Allied Structural Steel
case also in 1978 at 438 U.S., where this Court struck
down a statute, a state pension statute which imposed
immediate liability for all employees of ten years or
more, and compared once again the prospective not im­
mediate effect of ERISA in so striking down the state
statute, and we are asking really for nothing more than
the continued recognition of that congressional intent
and purpose which appears on the face of the statute it­
self,

We really don’t have to look to legislate debate

or committee report.

It is right on the face of the

statute, and this Court I submit has recognized that very
strong intent and the result that should be reached in
this case in both the Manhart and the Allied case.,
QUESTION:

Well, there Is no Impairment of con­

tract clause applicable against the federal government, is
there?

25
MR. GETTLEMAL:

No, but there would be a very

analogous due process argument, Justice Rehnquist, which
we did raise in the lower courts.

The District Court did

not reach that point because it interpreted the statute
our way.

The Court of Appeals did reach the constitutional

question.

The grant of certiorari was limited only to the

interpretive issue and not the constitutional question.
But we think that there could be a very serious constitu­
tional question if the statute is interpreted the ’way the
respondents contend.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY ROSE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT, PBGC
MR. ROSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation submits
that the construction of the Act urged by the petitioner
defeats the purpose of Title IV of ERISA.

It would effec­

tively destroy a major part of the programThe Title IV program, as has been Indicated, is
traceable directly to the closing of the Studebaker plant
in 1964,

where two-thirds of the participants lost almost

all of their pension benefits.

And after a long study,

the Congress decided tc create an insurance system to

26
guarantee certain benefits to which the employees would
have been entitled but for the termination of the plan.
The guarantee program is administered by a new
agency, the Pension Ber.efit Guaranty Corporation„

Its

board of directors is made up of the Secretaries of Labor,
Commerce and Treasury <,
by premiums paid by
the program.

tainly do.
The statutory liability is less severe than if
Congress had made the employers liable to the plans or to
the participants for the benefits which the participants
had already become entitled to under the plan terms.

This

27
liability is measured by the unfunded benefits that the
PBGC guarantees, and that liability is to the PBGC and it
is limited to 30 percent of the employer’s net worth.
The Title IV program is one of three distinct
programs under ERISA.
QUESTION:

It is less severe, you said, and it

is less severe only by reason of that 30 percent limitation?
MR. ROSE:

No, there are other reasons.

There

are certain benefits that must be phased in when a benefit
increase occurs.

And if it hasn’t been phased in for the

appropriate amount of years, it would not be guaranteed.
QUESTION:

Is that applicable here?

MR. ROSE:

No, it is not.

It is not applicable

in this case.
QUESTION:

And the 30 percent allocation doesn't

come into play here, does it?
MR. ROSE:

Not as far as I know.

We don't

have those facts.
QUESTION:

So in thi3 case it is neither more

nor less severe.
MR. ROSE:

As far as I know, that is true, yes.

But we are construing the statute for a universe of
80,000 plans.

1

This is one of three distinct programs under
the umbrella ERISA and there are three different agencies

28
with three difTerent effective dates.

In general, the

Title IV program administered by the PBGC was made effec­
tive immediately, that is September 2, 1974.

The Title

I and Title II programs administered by the Labor and
Treasury Departments respectively had deferred effective
dates,
Now, the congressional sense of urgency about
getting the Title IV program under way was so great that
they even provided for the coverage of participants in
plans that terminated in the two months preceding the date
of enactment and for that preenactment coverage the
Congress completely waived employer liability.

For plan

terminations that took place within a nine-month period
immediately following the date of enactment, the Congress
made a special rule, that Is they authorised the PBGC to
waive or reduce the employer liability upon a showing of
hardship.
Now, Congress knew that Title IV had to go into
effect immediately in order to provide prompt and effect

tive protection to the employees concerned.

And since

the termination insurance program operates by statutory
rule without the need of plan amendments, there was no
reason for delay.
In contrast, the vesting standards and related
provisions in Titles I and II required plans to make

29
complex amendments.

Per example, there are three permis­

sible vesting rules permitted by the statute and plans must
conform with at least one of them.

Congress deferred the

effective date of these provisions for 16 months so that
employers would have an opportunity to study them and make
their choice and to effect the amendments.

The reasons

for deferring these Title I provisions simply don't apply
to Title IV.
The guarantee which is the heart of Title IV
provides that the corporation shall guarantee the payment
of all non-forfeitable benefits subject to the limitations
we have discussed.

The controversy here turns on the

meaning of non-forfeitable.
The PBGC adopted a definition in a regulation
which fulfills the congressional objective to guarantee
benefits for which employees had attained eligibility and
would have received but for the termination of the plan.
The Court of Appeals accepted the substance of
the PBGC definition but it read it into the definition of
non-forfeitable found in Title I.

That reasoning works

in this case in order to reach the right result, because
there is no condition here on the participants entitled
to a benefit, but that approach might tragically deprive
participants in other situations of needed benefits.
QUESTION:

Sc that is apart from the reasoning

of the Seventh Circuit at that point?
MR. ROSE:

To this extent, yes, sir.

Let me

Disability benefits are normally conditional

on continued disability.

There is always the —

QUESTION:

Although it doesn’t affect your client.

MR. ROSE:

I'm sorry, sir?

QUESTION:

Although it doesn’t make any differ­

ence in this case which approach you —
MR. ROSE:

That's correct, it does not make a

difference in this case, but we are construing a statute
that has to be applied to 80,000 other plans.
QUESTION:

I understand but as applied to this

one it will reach the same result with either approach.
MR. ROSE:

That is correct.

In case of dis­

ability benefits there is always the possibility and hope
of recovery, and if Title I definition were applied there
would be a serious question as to whether any disability
benefits could be guaranteeable under Title IV; whereas,
the PBGC definition guarantees such benefits as we think
the Congress intended.
QUESTION:

Do you think that Congress used the

terms ’’vested” and tfnon-forfeitable" interchangeably
throughout the Act?
MR. ROSE:
Rehnquist.

Yes, I think that is clear, Justice

They did throughout the debates and you will

31
even notice that where the statute says unforfeitable
frequently In the conference report or the committee report
also used the term "vested.”
It is not necessary to take the risk that bene­
fits such as disability benefits will have that result.
It is clear from the scheme of the statute that it does
not call for a rigid uniformity of definition.

The

Congress itself established three separate definition
sections in Titles Is II and IV.

All of the definitions

in Title I including non-forfeitable are expressly re­
stricted to Title I by the statutory language.
Had

Congress wanted in Title I definition to

apply in Title IV, it would have said so explicitly.

For

example, Title IV defir.es the word "administrator” by
explicit reference to the Title I definition of "adminis­
trator»"

In contrast. Title IV does not define the

fundamental word "participant."
tion in Title I.
broad terms.

There is such a defini­

Title I defines "participant" in very

That is so that an individual who has a

claim under a plan will have ready access to the plan
documents, as Title I would give him, and it gives him
standing to pursue that claim under Title I.

Now, that

definition applied to Title IV simply doesn't work.
I have already made reference to the fact that
the program is financed by premiums paid by the plans.

32
That premium is a function of the number of participants
in the plan.

And in a number of plans, the administrator

has no i*ay of knowing how many people might have
claims against that plan.
Congress did not define ”non-forfeitable,f for
Title IV purposes and accordingly the PBGC supplied its
own.
Now, under the Title I definition, a benefit as
the petitioner has argued here just a moment ago, a
benefit is not forfeitable only when the claims of the
benefit is unconditional.

Referring to its own plan at

page 28 of its brief, petitioner says that the invested
benefits were not non-forfeitable since they were condi­
tioned on full funding and were not in fact fully funded
and therefore not guaranteed.

Well, what benefits could

be guaranteed- under this theory of fully funded benefits?
But that doesn’t make any sense.
There is no reed to establish a new social pro­
gram through insurance in order to pay benefits that the
plan already has the funds to pay.

The petitioner argues

that the Congress intended the guarantee to apply only in
plans that were not conditioned on full funding and by
that the petitioner means plans without a limitation of
liability clause.

The Congress knew that they did and clearly
stated its intent to soften the impact of those clauses on
employees through termination insurance.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rose, your opponent said about

half the plans terminated during this period did not have
such clauses»

Do you disagree as a matter of fact?

MR. ROSE:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

How do we resolve this?

Do we have

to look at all of these plans?
MR. ROSE:

The. fact of the matter i3 there was

an affidavit filed to the effect that 78 out of 136 plsns
had limitation of liability clauses like the one in the
petitioner's plan, but that does not mean that, as the
petitioner would have it, that the other plans did not
have other language which was just as effective and ac­
complished the same purpose.

It is just that the ---

QUESTION:

Why would you file that affidavit?

MR. ROSE:

Well, at that time, Justice Rehnquist,

we thought it was enough to show that a majority of the
plans had practically identical language, but the fact of
the matter is that practically all plans have similar
language with the same legal effect.
In fact, the proposition that virtually all of
the pension plans have had and continue to have limitation
of liability clauses is supported by the standard

34
literature in the field.

It is a finding of the Court of

Appeals below, and it is a premise on which the Congress
acted.

The Studebaker plan had such a class in 1964 and

the Internal Revenue Service includes such a clause in a
prototype plan that it issued in 1977, and thousands of
%

plans have been established on the basis of that prototype®
Therefore, it is true, as the Court of Appeals observed
below, that the petitioner’s viev/ would make the enact­
ment of Title IV almost meaningless®
Now, reference is made to retroactivity here.
The Congress wa.s very clear as to when Title IV was to
be effective, and it was immediately.

And the Congress

specified which portions of the program should have
retroactive effect and which not.
For example. Title IV certainly had retroactive
impact upon participants in plans that terminated in the
two months preceding enactment because it made them
eligible for benefits under the program.

As to the impo­

sition of employer liability, the Congress was careful®
It applied — it imposed employer liability only on
employers that terminated plans after the date of enact­
ment .
Now, it is true that that liability is measured
in part by service of employment that took place prior to
the date of enactment, but in that sense it has a

35
retroactive impact.

But that kind of retroactive impact

would be here whether the effective date of the employer
liability was 197^, 197 6, 1980, or even later*.
Let me correct for the Court a couple of im­
pressions that have been left by the petitioner.

Reference

has been made that the act requires after 1976 a minimum
level of benefits.

There is nothing in the act that re­

quires any minimum level of benefits.

It is not relevant

to this case, but I thought it was misleading to the Court.
There are minimum standards for vesting, funding,
participation and such things, but there are no minimum
level of benefits.

There certainly is no limitation as

the petition suggests on liability clauses after 19:76,
none whatsoever,

■;

;

I suggest you look at the General Motor clause
that is presently in existence, and clearly that is a
legal clause.
The point has been made that this plan is a
collectively bargained plan, and certainly that is true.
However, I think it is important for the Court to have in
mind the fact that we are construing a statute applicable
to a universe on which almost 90 percent of the plans are
not collectively bargained.
Reference has also been made —
QUESTION:

Mr. Rose, let me just clarify one

36
thing in my mind.

Your opponent, in response to a question

I asked, said that if this plan had been terminated a year
later, in that Interval between r76 and *77 they would
have been required by the statute to amend the plan to make
what are now vested ber.efits also non-forfeitable.

Do you

agree with that?
MR. ROSE:

Me.

This plan had non-forfeitable

benefits in it already.
QUESTION:

1 understand, but would they have

been required to make any change in the plan?
MR. ROSE:

All plans were required to amend

themselves to comply with Titles I and II.

Yes, if the

vesting standards in the plan did not meet the minimum
standards for investing, funding and participation, they
had to be amended, but that would not affect In any way
whatsoever the employer liability or the relationship to
Title IV except insofar as the guarantee is related to
the plan berms,as the plan terms became improved the
guarantee would improve also.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. ROSE:

Reference has been made to statutory

subjugation.

There is no subjugation under this statute,

none whatsoever.

The liability of the employer under

Title IV is a statutory liability to the PBGC.

We have-

no subjugated right against the employer derivative from

37
the participants at all.
In closing, let me say that before the enactment
of ERISA, the defined — when a defined benefit pension
plan terminated without sufficient funds to pay the accrued
benefits that the participants had already accrued, the
entire burden of that Insufficiency fell on the shoulders
of the participants.

Fy enacting Title IV, Congress has

made a decision that nc longer should that burden of in­
sufficiency be borne by the participants alone.

Congress

decided that that burden should be shared by their employer
and by the premium payers to the PBGC.
Thank you.

Mr. Whitman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. JAY WHITMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT, UAW
MR. WHITMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It

please the Court:
When you are dealing with any statutory issue as
we are hare, it really makes sense to begin with under­
standing the problem that Congress was trying to solve.
The problem here as Congress saw it was that people who
had worked for employers for a good long piece of time
w me losing their expected pension benefits.
wanted to stop that.

Congress

Congress knew that very often, as

a matter of contract law, these expectations couldn’t be

38
met as a matter of contract law.
But this isn't a contractual case., it isn’t a
contractual issue.

In fact, the fact that the contractual

arrangements were not adequate is what made Congress seek
a legislative solution,,

That is what required a legisla­

tive solution»
Wow, in coming to that solution, Congress was
trying to solve a difficult problem and obviously it had
to make judgments, to strike a balance at the economic
hardships and the economic benefits in them, but that is
nothing novel.
Branch.

That is the function of the Legislative

They do it every day.
The petitioner disagrees with the burden that

was struck in this situation because Nachman voluntarily
chose to terminate its plan rather than say freeze the
plan»

They are now facing the consequence of that ter­

mination .
But the solution has really nothing to do with
the contractual arrangements other than, as Mr. Rose
said, they take their measure in some degree from the
contractual arrangements.

The loss that Congress was

trying to prevent, loss of these expectations occurred
in a couple of different ways.
In on-going pension plans, it occurred because
of overly restrictive vesting requirements, the sort of

39
provision we had In the Daniels case, the 20 years, if you
don?t work 20 continuous years you lose your pention.

Or

it could have occurred because of lax funding and the
money wasn’t there or because
the money.

some fiduciary embezzled

Those were problems where the loss occurred in

on-going plan situations.
Congress was well aware from the Studebaker
example, which was a very painful example, and from the
Department of Labor and Treasury study which it relied on,
the ?72 study, that it was entirely possible and indeed
generally the case that in plans where you had exemplary
vesting requirements and where the funding was not ques­
tioned, it was actuarijy sound, you could still have a
loss, you could still have that human tragedy because of
a plan termination short of the full amortization cycle
so that the money wasn’t there.
Now, Title I and Title II, the vesting require­
ments which petitioner wants to bring into this case,
obviously couldn't solve that problem.
solve the Studebaker problem.

They couldn't

You needed Title TVa

You

needed an insurance arrangement to solve that problem.
If you understand the two different sources of
the loss and the functions of the different titles, you
sea, then it is clear why the effective dates of Title I
and II really have nothing to do with the method chosen

by Congress to solve the problem in Title IV»
Now, the legislative history is plain in terms
of Congress’ intent to make Title IV effective Immediately,
indeed retroactively»

It is also plain that Congress

realized that the bulk of the losses occurred because of
these limitation liability clauses-

That 1972 joint

departmental study I think said some- 72 percent of the
cases, the loss of benefit expectations was l/1000th of
the net worth of the employer that terminated the plan,
and only 3 percent of the cases where the loss was occassioned by some insolvency problem because the employer s
net iforth was down to about the level of the benefits
that were lost.
Now, turning to the -- Mr. Hose has alreadyspoken about the fact that you really can’t square a 16month delay which-follows from Nachman’s position with
the two-month retroactivity and the none-month post act
possibility of a waiver.

But let me turn to the language

of Title IV itself.
Throughout Title IV, the language presumes a
logical ability to disc inguish between the existence of
non-forfeitable claims and claims which are not fully
funded, and that is not at all odd because it is claims
that are non-forfeitable but not fully funded that need
a guarantee.

Yet, of course, Nachmsn’s position doesn’t

m
admit that ther can be such a beast.

The clearest example

of that is in the provisions in 4044(d) the distribution
of assets.

There is a fifth category which says other

non-forfeitable benefits.
Well, of course, the existence of that category
makes absolutely no sense on Nachman9s reading, assuming
arguendo we apply 319? and we have good reasons not to.
And throughout the other parts of Title IV we
have the trustee being charged to do a calculation as to
what the non-forfeltable benefits are and what the funds
available are.

The PBGC becomes trustee in some situation

and it is charged with doing that calculation. The trus­
tees have to make reports under Title I as to what non­
forfeitable benefits exist that aren’t fully funded.
Those things are either trivial or nonsensical on
Nachman’s reading.
In conclusion, I would like to address this
problem of limitation of liability clause that Mr.
Justice Rehnquist raised.

Those limitation of liability

clauses were lawful before ERISA.

They are lawful now.

Westlnghouse, GM, Studebaker, and others are indistin­
guis able in result.

They serve a real purpose, and

General Motors is right to have some trepidations there.
They provide that a participant cannot bring a direct
action against the assets of, say, the General Motors

Corporation for his ber.efit entitlement»

They regulate

between the participant and the employer.

They

Indeed, if anything,

it was Congress' purpose In Title IV to make those limita­
tion of liability clauses irrelevant because what they
were doing was preventing people from actually

coming

Into possession of their benefits.

43
QUESTION:

I understand.

We are addressing the

question of what good do these limitation of liability
clauses do the company.

You say the good is it protects

them from a suit by the employee, and my question is what
difference does that make if they are going to have to pay
*

to the insurance corporation anyway»
MR. WHITMAN:
example»

I can illustrate with a simple

Suppose you have a plan where the level of

benefits exceeds the guarantee level, where because of the
phase-in rules PBGC's guarantee is substantially lower,
which is. by the way, the case in the General Auto Industry
plan.

In that situation, the limitation liability clause

would operate to prevent PBGC from going any further to
collect for those benefits above the level.
QUESTION:

In other words, the insurance isn't

for the full amount of bhe non-forfeitable benefit, it is
only for the amount that the statute prescribes that it
must be»
MR. WHITMAN:

That’s right, which in many cases

is substantially less because PBGC doesn't guarantee the
full sum.
QUESTION:

Is there any difference between the

benefit level and the statutory mandated, level?
MR. WHITMAN:

In this situation, Your Honor, the

benefit levels in the plan were very low.

It was a low

wage enterprise in the inner City of Chicago and it hap­
pens that the PBGC guarantees are essentially the same,
perhaps identical.

I am not sure the exact figures„

QUESTION:

Sc there are two differences then.

One is that the limitation is only 30 percent of the asset
the net worth of the company; and, secondly, it is a dif­
ferent benefit level.
MR» WHITMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes»

Ar.d the guarantee is different than

the plan level.
MR. WHITMAN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

I understand that.

QUESTION:

Mr. Whitman, if the company disclaims

liability in its agreements with the employees as to the
company itself, you say that Title IV nonetheless entitles
PBGC to come after the company under the circumstances
specified by Justice Stevens?
MR. WHITMAN:

No, the limitation of liability

clause in the plan would prevent PBGC from pursuing the
company on its own assets.

PBGC can only pursue the com­

pany when it does so under 4o62 of the act and then only
under the conditions specified.

Among those are that

4062 claimed liability can only arise from the fact that
P3GC guarantees benefits and only to the extent that it
does guarantee benefits.

If it doesn't guarantee benefits

45
because of trie phase-in rule or because you hit the 30
percent pay, the 4062 liability drops correspondingly.
QUESTION:

Okay.

But after January 1, 1976,

General Motors flatly provided in a contract that there
shall be no liability on the part of the company for
pension benefits.

Now. under ERISA can PBGC come after

General Motors if the plan defaults?
MR. WHITMAN:

If today for some reason that I

can’t imagine General Motors would
QUESTION:

Let’s say General something or other

then.
MR. WHITMAN:

We should all go home if General

Motors terminated its pension plan.
If General Motors were to terminate and as a
result PBGC had. to pay benefits under 4022, which would
be the case because there is an unfunded past service
liability in the General Motors pension plan, indeed an
immense one.

Then PBGC would have a 4062 employer

liability claim against General Motors for that amount
but only that amount.
QUESTION:

So then an employer cannot completely

disclaim liability and figure that he is home free?
MR. WHITMAN:

You cannot, an employer- cannot

by prospective contract get immunity from a legislative
enactment, yes, sir, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. GETTLEMAN3 ESQ.3
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. GETTLEMAF :

Fine.

I shouldn!t need more than

that5, Your Honor.
Mr» Justice Fehnquist, let me read the clause
from the 3M contract»
brief.

It is on page 9 of their amicus

MNo liability for the payment of pension benefits

or supplements under the plan shall be imposed upon the
corporation, officers-, directors or stockholders except.
i

as otherwise may be required by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 197**."
It is an exercise in tail-chasing but an ex­
ercise which is permitted by the Internal Revenue Service.
We have cited I think in both of our briefs — I am read­
ing from page 9 of our reply brief -- the I»R.C. Regulation
1.411(a)., -which says, ’ Rights which are conditioned upon
sufficiency of plan assets in the event of termination or
pirtial termination are considered to be forfeitable be­
cause of such condition.''

Therefore, it would violate

section 203 which requires non-forfeitable benefits.

But

it goes on to say that the GM-typ.e clause will not be
considered to be forfeitable and will be tax qualified.

47
Whether that is a correct provision maybe will
have to wait until the day GM does terminate its plan or
Chrysler or somebody else»

That is not the provision

that was in our plan* apparently not the provision in a
lot of other plans which had a general disclaimer clause
in it.
And as far as the affidavit Mr. Rose and
Justice Rehnquist referred to* rather than read it, I will
just refer the Court.
through page

Ik,

It begins at page 70 and it goes

and if it doesn?t say what I said it

said, then I am just not reading the English language
correctly either.
As far as Mr. Whitman’s argument goes, for him
to say that the contract is not important i3 rather odd
when the Title IV guarantee by the PBGC is to guarantee
non-forfeitable benefits, not period, but it goes on,
"under the terms of a plan."

You must always look to the

terms of the plan to determine whether a benefit is non­
forfeitable »
And I think it is an odd day when the U.A.W.
is before this Court arguing that employees or employers
should get something other than they bargained for across
the collective bargaining table.

To eht extent that ERISA

changed the rules of that plan, it did so after 1976.

The

statute holds together when you read Titles I and II, and

'48
read them separately — to read Title I and Title II with
Title IV —- to read them separately results in a fragmented
nonsensical congressional purpose which I think this Court
once again, referring to Justice Stevens’ comments in the
Manhart case, has founc to be very coherent, very clear,
and that is the only thing we are seeking today, is the
recognition of that congressional intent.
Thank you.
