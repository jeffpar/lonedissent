ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. CURTISS McKEE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McKEE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

say it pleas© the Court:
This case is before the Court on a writ of
certiorari to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The

issue is whether attorneys who multiplied proceedings
in an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 and 42 U.S.C. section 1391 and thereby unreasonably
and vexatiously increased the costs may be personally
assessed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1927 with attorneys9 fees
as part of the excess costs incurred by an opposing party
as a- result of such conduct.
The case originated in the Western District of
Louisiana where it was dismissed without prejudice by
reason of the failure of the plaintiffs to answer -the
defendant’s .interrogatoriea as ordered by the court,
the failureof the plaintiff to produce one of the plain­
tiffs for a deposition, the general failure to prosecute
the suit and ultimately the plaintiffs' abandonment of

4
their claim.
The court after the dismissal and after an evi­
dentiary hearing on the matter of the assessment, of costs
at which the lawyers for the plaintiffs were represented
by their malpractice carrier9 the court awarded fees as
costs pursuant to 1927 and under the terms and pro­
visions of Title 111 and section 1988,

If. allowed

attorneys fees as part of the costs anc in the case of
Hutto v, Finney as decided by this Court in 197-5
attachable costs were equated with attorneys fee» under
12 'CJ.S.C. , section 1988.
Cur argument to the Court is plain and simple
because we rely on the plain meaning of the .statute and
whore the plain meaning of the statute is presents there
is no construction necesary.
ftow., the Fifth Circuit said that you Could not
combine these statutes, 42 U.S.C. and IS88 and Title vil
and 1927 on the other hand,

that you could not combine

them to obtain what the Fifth Circuit called a hybrid
result„
The Court of Appeals did this without any
explanation, without any discussion of the intolerable
cure of relationship of these statutes and without ex­
plaining away the plain language of the statute and

5
without pointing to any absurd, futile c-r unreasonable re­
sults ,
Where our costs are defined fcr determination
under section 1927, it must rely on other statutes for its
definitio??, and upon which statutes may it rely?

f'he

United States and the respondents say that it may rely on
only two statutes and that is 27 U.S.C. 1920 and IS23They admit that section 1927 must resort mechanically to
other statutes for definition, but they draw a barrier at
the resort to Title VII in section 1983,
The respondent and the amici government don’t
demonstrate any statutory or other limitation on section
1927’s access to Title VII anu section 1988 for the
definition of cost.

There is nothing in any statute to

prohibit this access to these statutes for cost.
Neither the respondents nor the United States
or any of the amici in this case assail the bare language
of the statute.

Their efforts are devoted to unsubstan­

tiated, unsupported speculation and postulation .on which
they offer no cases and no authority.
QUESTION:

Mr. McKee, one reason advanced by

the Court of Appeals for the Firth Circuit was that 1927
should be construed strictly because they regard it as
penal in nature.

Did you agi"ee with that?

MR. McKEE:

Your Honor, we could agree with it

6
for the purposes of argument.
QUESTION:

Do you think it would ba consistent

with the language in Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises,
where they say that the --- the Court said that on
attorneys fee awards, they flow almost as a matter of
right if he were to prevail on the merits?
MR. McKEE:

Well, Your Honor, there is authority

saying that such statutes are penal to one group of
people and not penal as to the others arid they are
remedial as to others»
QUESTION:

What authority is that?

I mean is

it authority.. from this Court?
MR. McKEE:

No, it is not.

It is Circuit Court

authority, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, 192? runs against the party,

doesnJt it?
MR. McKEE:

No, sir, 1927 now is the one that

shifts the cost to the lawyers,
QUESTION:

Yes. but the attorneys fee provision

says that the party is to pay the attorneys fee.
MR. McKEE:

Well, Your Honor, there is some

legislative history that says that it is against the party.
The actual language of Title VII and the actual language
of 42 U.S.C. 1988 are that the award of costs are to the
prevailing party.

7
QUESTION;

Mells normally they are taxed against

the losing party,
MR. McKEE:

Normally that is correct, yes.

Normally the statute deals in terns of parties and they
don't deal in terms of lawyers per- so.

1927 is a special

statute dealing with lawyers themselves for the proscribed
conduct that is described in 1927.
QUESTION;

Well, was it part cf the theory of

that that clients should not be penalised for the conduct
of the lawyer when the client is not in as good a position
to evaluate the technique as the lawyer is?
MR. McKEE:

That is absolutely correct. Your

Honor, and that is what was done —
QUESTION:

And that was not dene, for example,

with frivolous appeals without any statutory authority
under the inherent power of the court to protect its
operations?
MR. McKEE:
QUESTION:

Yes, they have, Your Honor.
I hope they have be cause we have

done it from the bench on the Court of Appeals in the
District of Columbia Circuit where there was a frivolous
appeal and we ordered the payment by the: lawyer, not by
the client.
MR. McKEE:

Yes. sir.

Section 1927 must have

its cost definition from some other statute.

Everybody

agrees on that.

Everybody agrees that you must go to 1920

and 1923 to get anything at all that that you are going to
pump into 192? to make it make any sense.

But Title VII

and section 1988 are also cost defining statutes and
there are at least — other than those two, there are at
least 3^ others.
There is nothing about the language of any os’
those statutes that prohibits their application to section
1927,

There is nothing that would prevent 1927 costs

from including attorneys fees as dictated by the statutes.
We also maintain before the Court that the bad
faith exception to the American rule supports this award.
The same shifting process is available.

The client is

•responsible under the Lincoln-Wabash doctrine and section
192? would shift such an award to the lawyer given the
proper finding.
Our position before the court on the policy
aspects of it is that the policy of all these statutes
are that meritorious suits will be expeditiously conducted
by competent counsel of impeccable integrity, strictly
on the issues and nothing that we suggest is alien fco
that policy whatever.
If the Court please, with our argument relying
upon the plain meaning of the statute, such as it is, we
would reserve the balance of our time, if there are no

questionss for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

Yes, I have one question.

Did the

District judge allow the attorneys fees i:o full or did he
restrict them to the excess over reasonableness?
MR. McKSE:

Your Honor., he allowed them in total,

There were some adjustments made to them, but as a prac­
tical matter he allowed them in total because he considered
that this suit was improvidently brought from the very be­
ginning and. that it was the responsibility of these
lawyers.
QUESTION:

And you think that is in line with

the statute?
MR. McKSE:

To the extent. Your Honor, that

the decision may be read that he felt that the lawyers
were completely responsible for this situation, 1 might
add in his finding that he found that these lawyers had
taken advantage of three unfortunate clients and that
they had enlarged upon their claim, and to the extent that
you can attribute that from the very beginning, I think
the decision is correct. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Then in effect you are saying the

entire proceeding was unreasonable and vexatious?
MR. McKEE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I

dorrt think you can read, it any other way
QUESTION-

Therefore do you read the District

10
judge as saying there was no occasion to try to divide or
allocate?
MR. McKEE:

The entire thrust of the decisions

Mr. Chief Justice, is that it was an unfortunate matter
from the very beginning.
QUESTION:

One of these plaintiffs —

Well, it had to be more than unfor­

tunate, it had to be unreasonable and increase the costs.
It was vexatious.

In other words, it was — they don’t

use the term ’’frivolous” but isn’t there* some concept of
abuse of the processes of the court implicit, in this
statute?
MR. McKEE:

Yes, sir, I think so.

I don’t

think it goes quite as far as bad faith> Your Honor, but
I think it is certainly abusive of the process of tie
court.

; _
QUESTION:

You wouldn't say I suppose that

just because the District Court found that the litigation
had been vexatious and unjustified that the District
Court was bound to award costs, or that even if he
awarded the costs, that he was bound to include attorneys
fees as part of the costs?
MR. McKEE:
QUESTION:
MR. McKEE:

Mo, I wouldn’t, Your Honor.
So what is his standard?
Well, I understand this Court's

decision in Christiansburg that Christlansburg did not

dictate under what standards all of fchar.e things should be
allowed.

The only thing that Christiansburg said and the

only thing that I think this Court has ever said about
these standards are .Jfchat' these are guidelines for the
J udge *s discretion,
QUESTION:

Well, my ~~

MR, McKEE:
QUESTION:

So discretion —
My question really goes to what if we

happened to agree with you that the Court of Appeals was
wrong, what do we do then?

We don’t necessarily reinstate

the District Judge.
MR. MeSEE:
District Com

A- V.'* —

Your Honor, it was remanded to the

what the court called a proper award.

What we construe that to mean. and my brother on the other
side, Mr. Richard and I have entered into a s tipulation
as far as the District Court is concerneds is that the
purpose in that was to remove the attorneys f ees from the
award.
QUESTION:

I know, but assume we agree with you,

that doesn’t necessarily mean that you can keep your
District Court Judgment, does it?
MR. McKEE:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think it does, Your Honor.
Why?

You might say that there is

some other standard that ought to be followed.

The Court

of Appeals said you never include attorneys fees, right?

12
MR. McKEE:
QUESTION:
times you can?

That is what they say, yes.
What if we agree with you that some­

Do we automatically then agree with the

District Judge?
MR. Me KEF.:

I am afraid I don’t understand your

question, Mr. Justice White.

It is difficult for me to

follow it.
QUESTION;

If we thought the District Court had

over-reached a little bit in the exercise of discretion,
we might coneeivaly say you went too far when you allocated
all of these costsP

That Is possible, tut your position is,

I take it, that he did not abuse his discretion and there
should be an outright reversal here.
MR. McKEE:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don’t

want to eliminate the possibility that that may happen,.
That is Mr. Justice White* s question.

If this. Court

should feel that he has overstepped his bounds to the ex­
tent that he has awarded too much or that he did not find
the point at which the excess costs began, then obviously
it should be remanded to the Fifth Circuit with instruc­
tions to remand It to the District Court with those in­
structions.
QUESTION:

Mr. McKee, isn’t there an intermediate

ground to simply remand It to the Bifth Circuit with

in­

structions for them to decide whether or not they think

the District Court allowed the proper fees?

They didn't

reach that question.
MR. McKEE:

Your Honor is correct, they did not

reach the question.
QUESTION:

And they might well, if they say

some fees are awardable, might have sale.s well, these are
a little too much, but that Is up to them to decide In the
first instance.
MR. McKEE:

It was definitely established in

the Fifth Circuit decision that there is- no question but
that the proceedings were multiplied ant the conduct
fitted —
QUESTION:

And some fees would be appropriate

if they are ever appropriate»
MR o Me KSE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
But they didn’t address the question

of how much should be awarded,
MR. McKEE:
QUESTION:

That *s correct.
So we would say — if we agree with

yon, we should reverse and ask the Court; of Appeals to
see if the District Court abused its discretion.
MR. McKEE:

That's correct.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr

Richard.

14
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERSCHEL E. RICHARD, JR.,

SSQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. RICHARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Let me first make it clear that our argument
does not Intend to take the position as contended somewhat
by the reply brief filed by Roadway that lawyers are immune
from — have some sort of immunity from the court's sanetIcniRg those lawyers.

I think that there is adequate

legislation to allow the imposition of sanction on lawyers.
In fact, in this case Rule 3? of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure was available.

In fact, that is how this

whole attorneys fee business got started.
A motion was filed by counsel for Roadway to
assess attorneys fees under Rule 37 for failure to answer
Interrogatories and for failure to appear at a deposition.
The thing moved a long way from there to an awarding by
the District Court of $17,000,

In other words, the

attorneys fees in the whole case.
QUESTION:

So

Mr. Richard, do you support the

reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in saying that 1927
should be strictly construed because It is penal In nature?
MR. RICHARD:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I think that is —

How do you square that with the

language in Newman v. Piggy Park that says where a

15
plaintiff bringing a Title VII case is —• that attorneys
fees should be awarded almost as a matter of course?
MR. RICHARD:

Well, In the Piggy Park case, the

awarding of attorneys fees was not to punish the defendant
but it was the purpose of the statute to eliminate dis­
crimination.

It was to encourage the so-called private

attorney general .—
QUESTION:

But it certainly punished the de­

fendant in a sense,,
MR, RICHARD:

It punished the defendant to the

extent that they had to pay attorneys fees, but they —
and to the extent that — you could almost make the argu­
ment that they violated the law so it was justifiable for
them to be punished,
4

\

QUESTION;

Well, in 1927 is intended to punish

people who violate its conduct in a sense.
MR. RICHARD:
lawyers.

1927 is designed tc punish

I don't think there is any question about that.
QUESTION:

So the two really stand pretty much

on the same footing, don’t they?
MR. RICHARD:

Well, I don't think that the idea

of the attorneys fees provisions, if you look at the
legislative history of the provisions to allow attorneys
fees was to punish the lawyers but, rather, to encourage
the attorneys to take these sorts of cases that need to

be handled
QUESTION:
poison,

But one nan’s meat is another man’s

in a sense, the plaintiff’s lawyer gets an award

of attorneys fees, the defendants get the attorneys fees
award against them,
MR, RICHARD:

I think what you have to look at

though is the language of the statute.

The statute clearly

provides the award of attorneys fees under 2000e-5(k) and
the provision being interpreted in Piggey Park, but the
reason that the Fifth Circuit felt the reference to the
Fleischmann ease was important was that the language of
1927 is certainly not plain and unmistakable, because It
just says costs and it sure doesn't say attorneys fees,
and the purpose of the strict construction rule is to
insure that for one thing the lawyer in this case under

1927 knows what is coming.

When he just reads costs, he

sure doesn’t — he would think that’s costs, that is what
it says.

It doesn't say attorneys fees.
QUESTION:

Here is a plaintiff that sued and

lost, is that right?
MR. RICHARD:

This case was dismissed without

prejudice in this case.
QUESTION:

And then attorneys fees were assessed

against the lawyer for the plaintiff —
MR. RICHARD:

Yes., sir.

17
QUESTION:

— In favor of the defendant»

MR» RICHARD:
QUESTION:

That*3 correct.

Now, could an attorneys fee have been

allowed to the defendant against the plaintiff?
MR. RICHARD:

I don’t think so.

Excuse me, did

you say attorneys fees awarded against the plaintiffs in
the ~~
QUESTION:

Was this the kind of a ease that —

MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

Yes. this was a Title VII»

So that the prevailing party in

proper circumstances can be awarded attorneys fees.
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

Under Christiansburg.

So the defendant might have had an

award of attorneys fees against the plaintiff as a party,
MR. RICHARD:

That’s right, but that was not

the case in this —- that was not the situation in this
case and
QUESTION:

But nevertheless in these very 'cir­

cumstances the District judge would not have abused -his
discretion I suppose if he had awarded attorneys Tees in
favor of the defendant against the plaintiff as a party.
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

I don’t think so.

What do you mean, you don’t

MR. RICHARD:

In this case, under these facts,

there are no facts to award attorneys fees against the

18
party based on the rationale of Christiansburg.
QUESTIOM:

Why not?

MR. RICHARD:

Christiansburg looks to the claim

of the plaintiff, whether it was unreasonable, groundless,
frivolous I believe is the other word.

The record reflects

that two of the? three plaintiffs filed a claim through the
EEOC and reasonable cause for discrimination was found
with regard to two of the three plaintiffs.

So that left

the only evidence in the record as to, if you -want to
call it the merits of the claim.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. RICHARD:

So far as the record is concerned

in this case, under those facts, I don't believe you
could really —
QUESTION:

The award here wasn't based on bring­

ing a frivolous ease but on needless —
MR. RICHARD:
right.

On the conduct of the lawyers,

That is the problem, Your Honors, with the argu­

ment being made by Roadway in this case.

They say on page

17 of their brief — and I think this is basically their
problem with their rationale.

The authority of

the basic

award of attorneys fees In this case is not section 1927?
You've got to get attorneys fees out of 2000e~5(k) and
1988 as interpreted

by Christiansburg before you can hop

over to 1927, and the facts in this case don't support

19
that.

And I don*t think the legislative history of

2000e~5(fc) or 1988 support
QUESTION:

But that wasn’t the reason the Court

of Appeals, was it, saying that in this particular ease
there should have been no award of attorneys fees.

They

said you can never award attorneys fees.
MR. RICHARD:

They said — the issue was not

considered at all in the Court of Appeals like it has been
briefed here in this Court, Tour Honor.

As I was saying,

the legislative history of the civil rights statutes
provide attorneys fees and particularly when you look at
192? and the history of that statute* as the statute
was discusser: by this Court in the Alyaska case and in
that decision it is clear that — the legislation Is
clear that it was enacted at the same time as section or
what has become section 1920 and section

923» all of

which deal with the definition of r-cost? " ano what they
call docket fees or proctor*s fees can be awarded, and.
that is the limitation.
Congress, as this Court has said in Alyeska,
Cororess9 with regard to the question oi attorneys fee,
has gotten into the act and the federal courts do net have
so-called authority to grant attorneys fees —
QUESTION:

Let me go hack.

Suppose there had

been an award of fees against the plaint!:: t in this case

20
as a party on the grounds — suppose the plaintiff had
made a -— suppose the defendant had. made a motion for at­
torneys fees

on the grounds that this had been frivolous

litigation and said we are the prevailing partys this is
a proper case for an award of attorneys fees., and suppose
the District judge said you are quite right, you are en­
titled to attorneys fees but I will tell you what I am
going to do, I think it would, be unfair to make the
plaintiff pay them, I think 1 will make his lawyer pay
them because he is the one who brought this frivolous
case and needlessly ran the bill up,

MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

The problem with that is —

Would you still be making your argu­

ment?
MR, RICHARD:

Yes, because Congress has stepped

into the act, into the breach as far as what 1927 says.
The award of attorneys fees is based on the congressional
~~ the award of costs? against counsel i« based on section
1927»

Congress —
QUESTION:

I understand, but suppose attorneys

fees weyenf t even involved her© and the defendant wins tne
case and the plaintiff has to pay his costs, right?
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

Right,

Then the judge says, well, I think

this is a proper case for 1927 so I am going to make the

21
plaintiff’s lawyer pay the costs rather than the plaintiff.
That is what happens, isn’t it?
MR. RICHARD:

Well, you’ve got to go back to

1927 and read 1927 for what it says, that the lawyer juftfciplies the percentage of the case as to increase costs un­
reasonably and vexatiously.
QUESTION:

That is the standard.

Right.

MR. RICHARD:

And just because the plaintiff

lost I don’t think meets that standard,
QUESTION:

Well, let's suppose that because of

this lawyer’3 conduct costs were increased,
MR. RICHARD:
!

QUESTION:

All right.

The defendant’s costs were increased9

and he won and the plaintiff is going to have to pay his
costs.

Let’s forget attorneys fees for the moment — his

costs.

Then the judge says these costs were run up by

vexatious litigation by the attorney so I am going to
make the attorney pay them rather than hiu client.
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

Isn’t that —

MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

All right.

That is the.purpose of 1927.

Now you say that you just can’t fit

3.927 and the civil rights attorneys fee statute together.
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

You can't —

Because they are different.

22
MR. RICHARD:

That’s right, and you are mixing

apples and oranges,
QUESTION:

Well* don't you have to say with

respect to all the other federal statutes that provide for
the award of attorneys fees in addition to ordinary costs,
too, don’t you?
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

Yes.

You can never have attorneys fees as

a part of the award under 192? under your view?

MR. RICHARD:

That’s correct, yes, sir, because

of the language of 192? and the consideration of its inter­
relationship of 1920 and 1923*
Mr. Chief Justice, you mentioned the award of
fees for frivolous appeal.

I think that is established

by specific statute in -—
QUESTION:

Well, that was just frivolous appeal

as one example.
MR. RICHARD:

Rule 46(a) I believe of the

Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
QUESTION:

But absent any rule or statute, a

good many courts have treated that as an inherent power,
both federal and state, have they not?
MR. RICHARD:

Certainly the courts have awarded

attorneys fees against parties as part of —QUESTION:

No, 1 am talking about attorneys fees

23
against a lawyer as distinguished from the party»
MR, RICHARD;

Well, there have been no — none

of the cases cited by Roadway have reached that result.
suppose that you could discipline lawyers by contempt,
but that is not what we have here. Your- Honors.

The

final
QUESTION:

Don’t you think it would be proper

for a judge to award — under 1927, wouldn’t it be proper
to award costs, to stick the attorney with costa if the
judge thought the action was just simply frivolous and
vexatious, just no merit whatsoever?
MR, RICHARD:

.—

I think it is in the conduct of

litigation is —*
QUESTION:

Well, It says who so multiplies the

proceedings in any ease.
multiply it

Wall, the first time you

is when you file it.

MR. RICHARD:

That is assuming that the 'claim

had no merit to begin with.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

Exactly.

Assume the case

had no merit to begin wi-th and it was just
MR. RICHARD:

vexatious.

Under those facts, which I don’t

think are applicable here, I think that 1927 would prob­
ably reach that, that conduct.
QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about

section 1920 which describes taxable costs.

As I

I

24
understand your argument, it is that 3.927 does pick up
those items of taxable costs?
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And my question is does it pick up

these items of taxable costs that have been added recently?

Fop example, 1 think the statute now allows compensation
to court appointed experts and interpreters and some
other things which were not part of the statute when 1927
was first enacted.

Are they properly taxable under this

again3t 1awyera?
MR. RICHARD:

Well, I think so, Your Honor, I

think that they would be.
QUESTION:

Well, if you include subsequently

added costs, why don't you include attorneys fees which
are taxable as part of the costs in Title VII litigation?
MR. RICHARD:

Well, because I think of the

relationship —QUESTION;

It is not In 1920, is that the reason?

MR. RICHARD:
at —

It is not in 192?.

When you look

...
QUESTION:

In other words, you would read

section 1927 as saying those costs authorised by section
1920 and nothing e3.se.
MR. RICHARD:

They are all in the same chapter,

1923 or whatever it Is, yes, sir.

25
QUESTION:

It has to be in the same chapter,

MR. RICHARD:

Well, you have to read It» looking

at what Congress intended and one of the things you con­
sider is the definition of costs within that particular
chapter.
J

One other thing that I would like to mention

as

to the award by the District Court of $17,000 and what the
Fifth Circuit did,

The Fifth Circuit’s remand was to go

back and find out what costs should be awarded under 1927.
QUESTION:

But they said under no event could

attorneys fees be awarded.
MR. RICHARD:

That’s correct.

That’s correct.

That is the clearest reading of 1927.
Thank you.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Shapiro.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRIET S, SHAPIRO', ESQ,,
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
My function here today is to emphasize the
government’s disagreement with petitioner’s reading of
section 1927 which singles out lawyers litigating cases
under federal statutes that provide for the recovery of
attorneys fees.

And ray basic point is that these attorney

fee statutes provide for recovery against the opposing

26
party.

It distorts their purpose to read them as also ap­

proving recovery against counsel for that party.
The attorney fee provisions in the Civil Rights
Acts are typical of those in many other federal statutas.
They serve two related purposes.

The first purpose is to

encourage private parties to enforce important federal
policies»

That is the private attorney general principle.

The eost of hiring counsel is likely to be a serious
problem to victims of employment discrimination, but that
problem is less serious if successful plaintiffs can re­
cover their counsel fees.

That means that the litigation

will essentially pay for itself.

That makes it attractive

from the point of view of the lawyers, and Congress recog­
nised that in civil rights cases It is a problem finding
lawyers that are willing to take these oases.

But if

counsel fees can be recovered by the prevailing parlly,
thin the lawyers are more likely to be interested .in taking
the cases.

They become attractive eases.
But if litigating these eases imposes a special

risk that is not part of the normal risks of litigating
' 'M
i

■

■

•

eases in any event, then the cases are unattractive to the
lawyers.

That makes It harder* for the victims —
QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapiro, award of attorneys fees

on both sides is provided in Title VII case, isn't it?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

That's true, but —

27
QUESTION:

So In effect the lawyer who undertakes

to defend a civil Title VII action is faced with the same
sort of problem as the lawyer who takes on the plaintiff’s
case *
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, lawyers fees are recover­

able to the prevailing party, but in reading Piggey Park
and Christlansburg, the standards are different.

The

plaintiff’s lawyer car. expect to recover his fees absent
extraordinary circumstances., so he is the one that is en­
couraged to take the- case.

The defendant’s lawyer, the

Congress didn’t feel that he needed the special incentive
and for the reasons that are not ~~
QUESTION:

Well, Congress has given him a

special incentive to a certain extent because it does
authorize the award of attorneys fees as costs to the
defendant under the Christianaburg standard*
MRS, SHAPIRO:
tially blameless.

Only If the defendant is essen­

If the suit is without merit, in that

situation, yes, then the defendant, is entitled to recover
his costs.

It is not nearly as generous a cost provision»
QUESTION:

Mrs» Shapiro, we are dealing with

exceptional cases to start with, because most lawyers
don’t misbehave and

give rise to claims of this kind,

and I think we have to start with the assumption that the
lawyers did something that lawyers do not normally do*

28
And if you have a ease in which a plaintiff is perhaps
named as a class representative or something, is relatively
unsophisticated and the lawyer persuades the plaintiff to
file a totally meritless claim and makes a lot of trouble
for the other side and runs up the kind of situation
where normally a district judge would say the plaintiff
ought to be charged with costs, your position really is
that they shouldn’t he recovered from anybody because you
just don’t want to stick the innocent plaintiff with them
and so you are saying nobody should have to pay.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, I think the Court really

faced that problem in Christiansburg because in Christiansburg you made it fairly clear that you were not saying
that only the bad-faith plaintiff could expect to have
attorneys fees recovered against him.

It was also the

frivolous case, regardless of bad faith3 so 3.' think you
already faced In Christianshurg the fact that you do look
to the party to make sure that he doesn’t bring frivolous
suitsj not just saying* well* I was misled, that it is up
to the party to assure that he doesn’t bring frivolous
suit* that if he does then he bears the risk of having
counsel fees assessed against him.

And I think that it

is importent that that is where the line has been drawn
between the protection cf defendants and the protection
of plaintiffs.

29
The difficulty with the petitioners point of
view is that 1927 is penal and it is looking at the at­
torney's responsibility, the attorney^ responsibility for
the way he litigates.

The attorney fee provisions in the

substantive statutes are not penal9 they ere looking at
the merits of the case and either encourage —QUESTION:

Once they say fees are part of the

costs, how do you get out of the statutory language?

How

do you meet the plain language?
MRS» SHAPIRO:

Well, the purpose of saying the

fees are part of the costs in the substantive statutes is
(a) this private attorney general principle —
QUESTION:

Well, you used the language c,f‘ees as

part of the costs55 in one statute as entirely different
meaning than in 1927.
MRS, SHAPIRO:

That’s right.

192? was part of

the original bill in 1853 that said that these costs and
no others are to be recovered, and so the costs in 1927
are the costs that are defined in 1920 and 1923QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapiro, what if a general

statute were passed, what if Congress just decided to
change the so-called American rule and say from here on
we will adopt the British rule that ordinarily attorneys
fees will be allowed to the prevailing party as a part of
costs?

Suppose there was a general statute like that,

30
just general?
MRS- SHAPIRO:

Then you wouldn't have the sing­

ling out problem, which Is our basic — that is the problem,
our fundamental policy problem,
QUESTION:

How does that get you though to ex­

cluding attorneys fees from costs?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

I don't ~

Well —

---- because in my example, I take it

you would say that, well, I guess attorneys fees are part
of costs that can be charged against the lawyer.

MRS. SHAPIRO:

If you just had a statute that

said attorneys fees are part of the costs —
QUESTION:

And they are allowable to the pre-

vallng party.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

— and they are allowable to

.the prevailing party, without amending 1927, then you
would still have 1927 as part of — assuming this statute
didn't overrule the 1853 act.
QUESTION:

What if you amend 1920?

MRS„ SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well —

Put Mr. Justice White's statute in

as subsection (7) of 1920, there is just an additional
item of costs and additional docket fees, just say
attorneys fees.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

There has been a proposal, there

31
is a proposal in Congress to -—
QUESTION:

I understand.

Supposing it was

passed* would that not be picked up by 1927 then?
HRS* SHAPIRO:

Sure.

Well* the proposal is to

amend 1927.
QUESTION;

I mean if you just amended 1920.

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QU2STT0M:

I think that would ~-

But what you are saying is the word

"costs” only applies if it is costs in all litigation
and doesn’t apply if it is a special kind of -costs for a
one kind of case like civil rights or antitrust or some­
thing like that.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

When you have the singling out.

you got real policy problems.
QUESTION:

The problem that I see with your

argument is you seem to assume that the singling out was
totally for the benefit of the plaintiffs * b-ut. it seams
to me that is inconsistent with the notion that whichever
party prevails there is a right to costs — an opportunity
to have the judge assess fees as part of the costs.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

No.

The argument really is that

in the substantive statute you are talking about costs*
»

shifting costs against the parties, and however that line
is drawn between the parties, it is drawn on the basis of
the merits of the suit.

1927 says nothing about prevailing

32
parties»

It says excess costs and —QUESTION:

I just don’t understand.

You’ve got

a special statute, 1927, dealing with misbehaving lawyers
and I don’t know why you say a. misbehaving lawyer is any
different in one kind of case than another4.

It seems to

me in any kind of case, assuming that he can be treated,
he comas within the statutory language.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

We agree, a misbehaving lawyer

is a misbehaving lawyer and he ought to be subject to the
same penaltires, regardless of what kind of a statute he
is litigating unders he is subject to the penalties that
are provided in 1927 which are conventional costs.
QUESTION:

And if the consequences of misbe­

havior are that you have to pay the costs, I don't know
why you don't pay whatever costs are appropriate for that
kind of litigation»
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Because the purpose of putting

the particular costs in a particular statute ~~
QUESTION:

Without the plaintiffs.

MRS. SHAPIRO:

— there is a different basis

for that.
My time is expired.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
have anything further?

Mr. McKee, do you

33
ORAL ARGUMENT OP M. CURTISS McKEE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. McKEE:

Mr. Chief Justices you asked earlier

about the matter of improvident appeals and awards under
inherent powers.

It is a strange result, but on April 2,

the Fifth Circuit decided a ease —* a penal decided a case
called Self v„ Self, which is cited on page k of our reply
brief, in which they suggested that an award for just
such a reason might be made under 1927»
Mr. Justice Rehnqulst, on the question of penal,
our position is simply that where these statutes are as
elear as they are, that there is no construction needed.
And whether you admit, even if you admitted completely
that they might be penals, that it doesn’t change the
result that we are contending for.
If you follow the argument of the government,
you must say that Congress was not aware of 1920 or 19-23
when it passed 42 U.S.C. 1988 or Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of ‘64.

It has the effect of ignoring one of

the cases that they cided, which was Erlenbaugh, decided
by the Court in 1972, holding that Congress is presumed
to be aware of all previous statutes on the same subject.
Nor should we presume that Congress was aware
that 1920 and 1923 and intended something entirely dif­
ferent by the use of the phrase “as a part of the costs.

34
Congress has from time to time used various
phrases to define costs»

In 17 statutes, they have

separated them as "costs and attorneys fees," in five they
have used the language "together with," in 21 statutes
they have used '-’costs including attorneys fees," and in
15 statutes, the ones that wo are involved with today,
they used "costs as a part of.”
•The simple meaning of all of this is that these
attorneys fees are part of the taxable costs in these
cases and Hutto v. Firmey foreclosed any further discus­
sion of that,
I would like to comment very briefly on the
merit conduct distinction that has been advanced here
and that is that It is a very mechanistic argument which
divides the lawyer and his client and which divides the
suit into two parts, and it assigns
QUESTION:

Doesn’t 192? divide the lawyer from

his client?
MR. KcKEE:

It does, Your Honor, for the pur­

pose of the discretion of the court, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, you can have very serious

misconduct on the part of a lawyer in a very meritorious
ease, couldn’t you?
MR, McKEE:
QUESTION:

You could, sir,
And very exemplary conduct on the

35
part of the lawyer in a frivolous case,
MR, MelCEE:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
So aren’t they divided?

Aren't they

two quite separate things?
MRa MeKEE:

Well, they are, Your Honor, but you

can't divide them entirely for all of these purposes and
ignore the Link V. Wabash decision altogether.

But what

they have done is they have created a factual distinction
here where they divide the suit down the middle and they
assign the lawyer one side of $he suit and they assign
the client the other side, to wit, the bringing of the
suit is the client’s responsibility, the conduct of the
suit is that of the lawyer.

They apply Title VII to the

front side of that argument and 1927 to the back side of
it. and they are never to be met again, according to the
argument as it goes.
t V .

QUESTION:

Mr. McKee, having interrupted you,

let me say I didn't quite get the point of what you began
with, a recent case in the Fifth Circuit, Self v. Self I
think ii.*: was?
MR. McKEE:

Self r. Self, Mr, Justice Stewart,

is a case which was- a. domestic relations ease and some
how or other got appealed, got removed and was appealed
to the Fifth Circuit and Judge Clark, who was writing for
the panel, suggested that fees for the frivolous appeal

36
should be assessed against the lawyer under 192?.

QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION:

Under 1927 > could the strictures of

192? be applied against the lawyer for the prevailing
party?

Suppose the defendant in a given suit prevails

but the court concludes that all through the litigation
the defense counsel has used these tactics that are pro­
scribed, multiplying the proceedings in rear-guard action,
making it as difficult as possible all the way, but the
defendant finally prevails.
MR. McKEE:
QUESTION:

There is no question, Your Honor.
There is no question which way?

MR.- McKEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, this thing can

be applied to everyone who :1b involved in the litigation.
QUESTION:

It doesn’t make any difference

whether he is the prevailing party or the losing party.
MR. McKEE:

Not at all.

These offenses which

seem to come through the argument of the government, they
seem to come from somewhere else, and they are really
self-made.

The lawyer himself puts himself in this posi­

They don’t com® from outside and weiare not sing­

There is no singling

will conclude.
