MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-572, United States Parol® Commission against
Garaghty.
Mr. Jonas, I' think you may pressed whenever you8r©
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L, JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHAIF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JONESs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
This case is being argued in tandem with Deposit
Guaranty National Bank against Roper, in which the Court just
heard arguments.
In this oa.se, as with the. petitioners in Roper, we
contend that the case became moot upon the expiration of the
named plaintiffes claim, after tha District Court denied the
request for class certification.
But the facts of this case differ from those of Roper.
Respondent Garaghty initiated this action in 1976 while h© was
serving a 2-1/2 year criminal sentence in Federal prison.

He

contended that the parole guidelines that are used by the
United States Parol® Commission in determining whether and when
to release a prisoner on parole &r& invalid under the Parol®
Commission and Reorganization Act, and under the Constitution.
Ha moved to have the case certified as a class action

4
on behalf of all Federal prisoners who have been,, or will
become, eligible for parol®,
Tha District Court denied the request for class
certification, noting that the proposed class was too broad
because not all Fedoral prisoners share respondent's claims
in common.
QUESTION;
dispute in this case,
MR, JONES2
ir controversy,

Was there an allegation of $10,000 in
for jurisdictional purposes?
There was not an allegation of $10,000

Ha sought declaratory injunctive relief

against the Commission under 28 USC 1331.
Tha Court then rejected respondent’s legal claims on
the merits, and granted summary judgment to the Commission.
Rarapondant appealed, but while his appeal, was pending,
he was released from Federal prison at the eitpirafcion of his
criminal sentence,
Tha Court of Appeals ruled that although respondent's
legal claims became moot upon his release from prison, the case
was not moot,
The Court reasoned that if the proposed class was
certifiable, and the Court thought that it m.s because of th©
possible use of subclasses, than the case could be remanded to
tha District Court for class certification and then proceed on
behalf of the class.
And the Court also reversed the order of summary

5

judgment for the Commission, ruling that under respondent’s
allegations th® guidelines may conflict with statutory
parole criteria and create an ©s post facto enhancement of
punishment.
QUESTIONS

Had the

plaintiffs prayed for subclass

certification in tha District Court?
MR. JONESs
Court of Appeals.

Neither in th© District Court nor in th©

In th© Court of Appeals plaintiff contended

that the proposed class was not too broad.

The Court of

Appeals didn’t agree with that, and itself constructed the
subclass theory.
QUESTIONS
MR. JONES %

Raised it sua sponte?
Yes? tha Court of Appe als raised it

sua sponte.
We sought certiorari on four questions, and I911
discuss two of those at this time.
First, whether the case became moot upon respondent's
release from prison.
Second, whether th© Parole Commission guidelines are
invalid under.tha Parol® Commission and Reorganization Act.
We rely on our briefs on the remaining issues.
This Court has ruled on several occasions that there
is no constitutional, case or controversy, unless there exists
at each stags of the litigation an actual dispute between
adverse parties

6
And becau&jr of that, in Jacobs„ Pasadena and
K remans , th@ Court has hold that a cas© becomes moot if at th©
time th© claim of th® named litigant becomes moot, there is
not properly certified class, that can accede as a party to the
adversary position in th® litigation.
QUESTIONs Mr. Jones, would this case have become
moot if the plaintiff had been paroled

before th© certification

question had been decided in th® District Court?
MR. JONESf
QUESTION2

It would be equally moot.
So it really doesn't matter whether it's

before or after certification*— either before certification, or
after refusal to certify, it would be the sane issue?
MR. JONESs

Right.

What matters is that the time

>

his claim became moot, there was no properly certified class
that could coma into the cas© as a party to th© adversary
position in the litigation.
QUESTION»

But you"“*if the class had been certified,

then it would become, quote, moot, unquote, th® case would have
gone on?
MR., JONES 2

Yes.

Under Franks against Bowman

Tran sportation.
QUESTION ?

Yes.

QUESTIONs

And how about Soana against Iowa?

QUESTIONs

Sosna? and Sosna.

MR. JONES?

And also under Sosna.

1
QUESTIONS

And I suppose if .in the course of

appeals, the Court had just happened to break up its decision
into two parts, and as a very first opinion it wrote, it
reversed the class action—this was before there had been a
parole or—
MR. JONES 2
QUESTIONS

Right.
Suppose that the Court had decided that

the class action decision was wrong, and then he 'was paroled?
Then it would ba a Franks, I suppose, or a Sosna?
MR. JONES2

Well, if the class was certified, it

would b© a Franks or a Sosna.

This Court h©3n*t decided

whether a Court of Appeals can certify a class? it reserved
the question in Bast Texas Motor Freight agaInst Rodriguez.
But th® facta of this case wass

Ns class was

certified? th® respondent was released from arisen while the
appeal was pending? and it was after he was released from
prison that th© Court of Appeals entered its judgment.
Wall, under Kr&mena, Jacobs and Pasadena, there are
" t2i© 'separat® inquiries.

And th® first is whither at any time

in this litigation respondent's claims became moot.
And thera's really no dispute about that in this
case.

This Court has already decided th© issue in Weinstein

against Bradford, it held that a prisoner's claim challenging
parols procedures besom© moat upon his release from prison.
But th© situation may be different in th® case where

8

a prevailing plaintiff is seeking review of the judgment.

It

would mak© no @@n&@ t© say that a plaintiff's claim is made
moot by the entry ©£ judgment in the District Court.
The prevailing plaintiff has standing both to
enforce his claim? his judgment? and he also retains standing
in some situations to seek collateral relief that was denied
in the District Court.
And it was for this reason that in Coopers & Lybrand
and United Airlines against McDonald, the Court assumed that
whether a plaintiff wins or loses in District Court# h© retains
standing t© review the denial of class certification.
Th© judgment in the easa didn't xaake it moot.

The

question after judgment is entered is whether the plaintiff
obtained all the relief h© requested on his claim.

Th® tendar didn’t make the cas© moot; it

was simply an offer to settle*

It was not accepted by the

respondent.
What happened after the tender was rejected was that
the District Court entered an order saying that you’re entitled
to these damages, and that—-and then the question that
remains for the Court is whether that judgment--is whether
the respondent in that context has standing bo appeal the
judgment to raise collateral issues on which he was denied
relief in the District Court.
Our case is different from that.

MR. JONES *

And that's the question her®.
Well, I think the qu@st.ion is a little

different in the two cases, although the ultimata
the same:

'question is

Whether the plaintiff's claim is moot.

V
V

In our—in Garaghty, we contend that the plaintiff’s
claim is moot because it was extinguished by events wholly
apart from the litigation.

Weinstein, Jacobs:, Pasadena—these

ar© all those types of cases.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Jonas, ar© you saying, just so I gat

your point, that if in this case tha District, Judge had

12
ordered th© man

paroled, and the government had acquiesced

in th© ordar and said , wWa wona t appeal," then it would not
have bean moot?
Would that b@ a different case?

It would be different from the ease we

have.

MR, JONES?

If w© simply acquiesce in it for th® purpose of

complying with th© court9 s order—
QUESTIONs
MR, JONES?

You let him out and you don't appeal,
Wall, if w© don't appeal, than you’re

asking whether h® can appeal,
QUESTION:

Yea,

Wouldn’t then th© case be precisely

the sams as the Roper case?

Because you're distinguishing

Roper on the grounds that her® the parol® cam© without a court
order.
And I say, wall, suppose we had a court ordar? why
would that be any different?
MR, JONES?

Well, the distinction, I suppose,

between that case and Roper is, that after the ordar was
entered, the government by your hypothetical in effect settled

Its claim.

MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That's right.
And the same thing happened in Garaghty.
But the difference—
He says, *1'11 go out of jail, but I'm

going to keep the litigation going.”
MR. JONES:

The difference is that the claim is, in

fact, settled, that raises © whole new different—a whole
different question of mootness.

I'm just trying to undarstand,
the nonexistence of a court order?

Ar© you relying on

la that critical to your

case?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
MR. JONES;

And if so, why?

Well, the question is really what—-in

Roper the question is what the bank's relying on.

We're

relying on the fact that th® claim expired before any relief
was entered.
So we don't have to decide like in Roper whether the
relief was ©11 that was sought.

Here the claim expired before

any relief could be given.
A prisoner whose claim is expired Ls not entitled
to seek coercive, relief.
QUESTION %

That's only one of his claims.

But he

had two claims, didn't he?
MR. JONESs

Well, the claim that ha had that expired

was his claim which 'was. at that point th® only claim—he was
the only party in the case who could raise any claim.

When

his personal claim expired—
QUESTION:

Well,

.ha claimed class action, too,

didn't h@?
MR. JONESt

He ©ought class certification.

MR, JONES*

MR. JONESs

All right.

17
QUESTIONS

If that was true* isn’t that the end of

the class action?
MR. JONES;

W© noted in our brief that it’s possible

to say—
QUESTION;
MR. JONES;

That’s right.
«“that if a defendant undertakes a

series of action® in which he immediately pays off class
representative claims before certification, it’s possible
that the case could b© viewed like Garstain v. Pugh, that
the mootnese of the claim was inevitably intervening before
©vers the class certification order could ba ruled on.
QUESTION;

Well, it could be the case, the very

old case of Hansbury against Lee, where the Court said, you
couldn't do that? way back.
MR. JONESt
QUESTION;

That was in the forties.

Well, ws don't dispute that.
Well, I don’t expect you to go into

ancient history.
MR. JONES;
any event.

Yas, well, w® don’t dispute that, in

Because her© the plaintiff’s claim became moot

well aftsr the judgment—the Glass cartificati.cn motion was
ruled on,
QUESTION;

Would it he irrational to refer back to

the Roper“-would it fe@ irrational for Roper to claim that he
does hav© a continuing economic interest infch© maintenance
of the class action, because if there is no slaas action

18

ever allowed, the expense ©f litigation falls on him, whereas
if he can get 10,000 or 90,000 people in, tha expense of
litigation is going to ba spread, and ha won't have to pay
so much?
MR. JONES %

Well, I think that’s correct.

Also,

there'll be injunctiv© situations, where the class
representative's injunctive relief will be made better if other
members of his class also gain injunctive relief, a Titia VII
employment discrimination prospective injunctive relief.
QUESTION %

Now, relating that to this case, would

Geraghty's situation be any batter if there wars injunctive
relief with respect to the class action claim?
MR. JONES;?
QUESTION*
MR. JONES *

His relief would be unaffected.
He’s either out or he's in?
That’s tha natura of the parole relief

that he requests.
The fast relied on by the Court of Appeals that
class action may have been certifiable was irrelevant for
two reasons*

On®, we've already discussed, the action wasn't

certifiable in the Court of Appeals because the respondent's
claim was moot, h® couldn't serve as tha class representative?
there was no other litigant- in the court who

could have s©rv©d

as the class reprasontative? the class was not certifiable.
But more importantly, the» has to ba an actual
dispute between adverse parties at each stage of the litigation.

19

Tite fact that other parties could have been added byintervention ©r class certification, while respondent retained
his live claim, doesn’t alter the fact that they were not.
It’s a hypothetical, or a potential, controversy,
that doesn’t create a constitutional ease.

And because the

case became moot when it was in the Court of Appeals, this
Court, too, has no jurisdiction to grant a motion t© intervene
or add parties by class certification»
Federal courts have no power to esearcls© in moot
cases, other than to remand to the court below for the
judgments to fee vacated.
And w© submit that to be the appropriate disposition
ir„ this o&a®.
But if the ones is not moot, w© think the judgment
of the District Court should have been affirmed.
QUESTION*

Just before you leave the mootness, I

take it your position would be the same here if this case
didn’t involve this kind ©f a claim but involved a Roper kind
of a claim, that the Roper case became moot on appeal'?
Say there had been an appeal, a proper appeal, and
they have settled within the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

If they had settled in the Court of

Appeals, than the question is whether the settlement manifests
ar intention for all claims to b© ended.
QUESTION*

Well, Roper just took his money, and the

20
order denying the class certification had net yet been
reversed? Roper 1® just paid off, and h® accepted it,
MR, JONESs

Wall# 1 think that that»-the issue that

the Court had in mind in McDonald in its footnote, wh©n it
noted that a settlement is not necessarily always intended to
extinguish the plaintiff's right to appeal.

The Court assumed

or. the facts of McDonald that that settlement didn’t have that
effect.
It emphasised that the plaintiffs who settled had
already obtained summary judgment on their claims,
QUESTIONi

Everybody agrees—no one claims that

Rcper would hav© any—for himself hasn't any more claim.

His

only interestr remaining interest.,, is in the class aspect of
the suit.
Would you say that 'that case might not be moot» and
yet yours is?
MR, JONES %

Well # 1 don’t—I wouldn't say that his

personal claim is moot by the fact that ha9e had a favorable
j udgment.

that and Roper or any other case?
MR, JONES?
QUESTION?
MR. JONES?

That's —
You didn't do that to settle th® case?
~ a significant difference that we rely

on.
QUESTION?

What if in Roper, Mr. Jones, plaintiff

had written a letter to th® bank before suit saying, S’X claim
$15,000, and if you don't claim ma off, I'm going to bring a
class action for myself and a bunch of other people."
the bank replies, "Haro's a check for $15,000."

And

And the

plaintiff nonetheless went into District Court and filed
an action saying, "I've got my $15,000, but the class action
hasn't been settled

23

Would the District Court have any jurisdiction at
all?
MR. JONESs

No,

1

don’t think they would.

That would

b© much like our case*, where the claim was simply extinguished.
There was no power in the Federal court to adjudicat® this
claim, because it didn’t exist afe that point.

MR. FLAXMANj

That’s correct.

The only relief Mr.

Geraghty sought in the class action aspect of the complaint
was declaratory judgment that the system is unlawful.

He

sought individual relief to have him enlarge3 from custody
to preserve his claims, so that there3d be no question of
mootness, which is what we’ve been—-what's baan debated today.
Th© relief that he wanted was a judgment on his

unlawful.
That's precisely the same relief that would b© obtained

MR. FLAXMAN:

That’s correct, but he can continue to

defend, through appeal, the case ones it has bean filed.

At

the time he filed the lawsuit in December of 1976, Ger&ghty
was in prison, and ha had standing at that point.
At that, point, he was an adequate class representative.
Th® question which was raised as to whether he--the
District Court could find that Mr. Gereighty could still be
an adequate representative really isn’t dispositive, or isn't
©van at all relevant to th® question of whether this ,cas© is
moot.
There’s a continuing controversy between the
members of the potential class and the Parol© Commission about
-th® legality of the guidelines.

Th© interests of those

persons are, I think, adequately and vigorously presented in
this court as they w@r© in th© Court of Appeals on behalf of

Under that analysis, yon could be the

MR. FLAXMANa

That’s not trua? I was never personally

I did not have standing at the

time the action was commenced to bring th© action.
QUESTIONS

So there is some sort of a bridge crossing

29

at some stage or other?
MR. FLAXMANs

Well, I think the rule is ‘that at the

time the action is commenced, the class representative must be
a member ©f the class that he seeks to represent.
That's consistent with Rodrigues, and that's what's
met in this case.

Mr. Goraghty was in custody? had bean

denied parol®? had exhausted his administrative remedies.

But he wasn’t a member of the class which

he describes in his complaint?

That’s the situation presented by Mr. Hayes, whose
oh© of the additional prospective respondents.

33

There's something wrong with that system.

And what5s

wrong with that system is that it's contrary to what Congress
said the Parole Commission should be doing whan Congress passed
tiie 1976 Act.
The--jusfc to backtrack a little bit.

Our basic

claim in the case is that the guideline system is unlawful?
that it*s contrary to the statute.
The Court of Appeals reviewed the case on the grant
of summary judgment? -resolved—“looked at the facts

there ware

in dispute in light most favorable to the plaintiff's potential
class, and found that there ware several facts which were
material to its theory which could not be decided on the
present record.
The first is what weight is given to institutional
behavior in parole release decisions.

We allege that that is

not a factor in parole release decisions.
The Court of Appeals--the government disputed that
in their answer,, and the Court of Appeals concluded that that
question could only be disposed of on a full record.
We expect to show in the District Court that, as the
Parole Commission information reveals, in perhaps 3 percent
of all cases, there is a decision made to depart from its
guidelines because of institutional behavior.
What the Parole Commission guidelines consist of
*

is a chart which contains customary lengths of imprisonment

34

for varicas categories of offenses.

The categories are unrelated

to the sentence which was imposed, or to the sentence which
could have been imposed.
It's possible to be sentenced to an offense which is
punishable by not more than five years in prison, but come up
in the Parole Commission with an offense which should have—
which requires you to serve 70-85 months in prison.
The table of the guidelines is the natrix, which
consists of offense, severity levels, and salient factor scores.
The—our allegations that we expect to show in the District
Court, the way in which a parole release decision is made, is
that within four months after someone is in prison, they get
a parole hearing.

At that parole hearing, twa hearing examiners

sit down and look at these guidelines to re-rate the severity
of a prisoner's offensa.
They don't look at the sentence which was imposed?
they don't look at the sentence which could have been imposed?
they look at how this prisoner matches up on their score.
The Court of Appeals held that we weren't entitled
to summary judgment on that allegation? that we would have to
prove it.

And I think we can prove that easily, looking at

these individual decisions.
But on this record, I think the Court has to view th®
record the same way th® Court of Appeales did in light most
favorable to us, as if we had proved it.

35

Once the Parole Commission has re-rated the severity
of a prisoner's offense, the compote his salient factor score.
The salient, factor score goes from sero to eleven, and awards
points for various things that may or may not have been
statistically significant in post-release behavior of some
prisoners.
, .

The—once those two scales are computed, the hearing

examiner looks at the chert and sees what the customary length
of imprisonment should be.

Then there8s a judgment made as to

whether a decision should be made to depart from those guide­
lines.
We—at the hearing we had in District Court following
remand, we discovered that the Parole

Commission has meetings

periodically of its hearing examiners, which we expect the
evidence to show, is to keep them in line, to make sure that
they depart from, the guidelines as infrequently as possible.
What they do is to keep score, keep track of how
many decisions each hearing examiner makes outside of the
guidelines, and than to hold, meetings—

That's the—'

The customary

QUESTION;

You mean the maximum?

MR. FLAXMAN?
from a judge.

No, the—a prisoner gets a sentence

Let's say the judge gives him a fiva-year

37
sentence.

He then goes to -the Parol© Commission, and they

say, ”We think you should do 70-85 months in prison.

We see

no reason to make a decision outside of that customary range
of imprisonment.

Therefore, parole will be denied, and you

will be continued to expiration.”

Which means, generally, that

the prisoner will serve those five years that the judge gave
him, plus time off for good behavior.
The Parole Commission doesnst consider the sentence
which is given.

For, I think, 25 pereant of all prisoners,

that customary length of imprisonment, that r.ew sentence they
get from the Parole Board, is more than they got from the judge.
And for another 25 percent of all prisoners, what
the Parole Board wants to do is to release them before they
even become eligible for parole.
Therees only 50 percent of all prisoners who
accidentally fall into this range of customary length of
imprisonment.
Congress, in passing the 576 Act, did not tall the
Parole Board that it should be in the sentencing business.
Con gre s s ~-the 1976 Act was the result of a compromise between the
House bill, which would have created a presumption of parole
after a prisoner has served a ’third of his sentence, and the
Senate bill, which would have reenacted the old parole
release criteria, and which would have-~ar which would have
sought to ratify the gu5.delinea then existing.

38

The compromise which came out of the conference
committee was to, in effect, re-enact the same, pre-existing
criteria, but to require that decisions be made pursuant to
guidelines.
Now, from this, the Commission says that, well,
Congress is authorizing us to do what we've been doing before,
which was to use those kinds of guidelines.

That’s not at

all clear, and that’s exactly contrary to what’s in the
conference report, which talks about how, in promulgating
its guidelines, the Commission shall be cognisant of past
criticism of Its decision-making.
Some of those criticisms, which are in the House
hearings, was that the guidelines which the Board was using
are wrong? they usuro the sentencing function? and are just
improper.

The Board should not be in the sentencing business.
The—something else the 1976 Act did was to make

permanent some changes the Board had
reorganization in 1973.

adopted in administrative

The Commission seeks to argue that,

by making those improvements permanent, what Congress was doing
was saying the guidelines should be permanent.
But if we go back and look at the. Senate hearings,
we see that the controversy about those improvements was about
the delegation of authority to hearing examiners? that there
was some question about whether that could lawfully b© done
without new .'.legislation? and that’s what Congress was looking at.

39

There’s absolutely no indication that Congress
intended that the parole release decision should be a resentenc­
ing decision.

Congress intended parole to be made without

consideration of what the prisoners did in prison, which is
what the Court would have to read the statute as being in
order to hold that these guidelines are consistent withthe
1976 Act.
These—the Act, rather than saying that all these
factors could not be considered, the Act reaffirmed the view
that parole is dependent on what people do in prison.

And

that's—we allege, and expect to prove in District Court, is
not a factor in these guidelines? that what

these guidelines

are is a resentencing tool.
One question, which I think has been answered without
die;pute in the District Court, is, where did these guidelines
come from?

How did the Parole Commission get in the business

of malting parole release decisions without considering the
actual length of sentence?
And we've documented that fairly well, without any
dispute, that what happened was that the Parole Commission did
a study of how decisions were made in Youth Correction Act cases
where ‘there was n© sentence.

And this study showed that two

factors, or three factors, wars used in parols release
decisions.

And the people who did the study decided, or

mistakenly believed, that all release decisions were made the

40
sanie way as Youth Correction Act cases, and created guidelines
for the Board which applied those two or three factors.
The fact is that 75 percent of all adult prisoners
have to serve a third of their sentence before they become
eligible for parol®.

And it*s~-it*3 wrong to say that the

Parole Commission was making—-was using the same policy in
Youth Act cases that it was using in adult cases.
But that's why the length of sentence is no longer a
factor in the parol® release decision.

Because the Parole

Board entrusted to its researchers the task of developing
guidelines, which probably weren't understood by tie Board,
but which were-“Came to it as having been scientifically
developed, and which have been used to interfere with the
interests that the members of this potential class have in
parole release.
The—some of the other claims which were presented in
the complaint which were not brought up, I believe, in the
narrow question posed in the petitioner for certiorari,
includes

If these guidelines are consistent with the statute,

could Congress have lawfully delegated this power to the
Parole Commission?

Could Congress, without any standards at

all, says

to set—you, the Parole Commission, are to

You are

set new standards for how long people should be in prison?
Could Congress delegate this judicial function of
resentencing to an administrative agency?

41
And then there's another question which is based on
our allegation that* under the new policy, under the guide­
lines, people serve more time in prison than the served
formerly.

That was the heightened emphasis cn offense severity,

someone who would have been released after he or she had
served a third of their sentence, are.now required to serve
■

S

•"

their entire sentence in prison.

,...V

If this is true, and we expect the evidence t© show
that, then there's an ex post facto

question, which the

government seems to disagree with, hut based merely upon the
facts, rather than upon the applicability of the ex poet facto
clause to parole release decisions.
Those questions, X think, weren't brought up in the
narrow question three in th© petition

- for certiorari.

So

©van if the Court should agree with the Parols Commission, on
the issue it brought up, there should still ba further
proceedings in th® District Court,
And if the District Court concludes that Mr. Geraghty
cannot adequately represent the class because he's no longer in
prison, as w® told tho District Court in August of .1978, that’s
not relevant.

Thar® are other people who have communicated

with the attorneys for Mr. Geraghty who said, "We want to he
in your case.

Wa want to he named plaintiffs, because we think

the system is wrong and it should b© changed.'
QUESTIONi

Well, is that the traditional way people

42

become parties to lawsuits?
MR, FLAXMAN:

That’s a~I think the traditional

way parties perceive an injury and then seek legal assistance.
And that's exactly what's happened here.

People--the question

that Your Honor raised in Roper, how many of these 90,000
people in Roper know about the case, if that question is asked
here, I think that probably every prisoner who can read, or
who can converse with other prisoners, knows about this case.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Very well,

Mr. Jones, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JONES s

I wanted to point out again that the

respondent's arguments basically go to the wisdom and
reasonableness of the parole guidelines system.

And Senator

Burdick, rand the members of the conference committee, simply
disagree on whether •

is a wise system.

43
We not© on page S5 ©f our brief, Senator Burdick
explained that these were the guidelines that he wanted to have
promulgated under this legislation, and the conference
committee reports, and now I'll quote it, "The promulgation
of guidelines to make parole less disparate end more under­
standable has met with such success that this legislation
incorporates the system into the statute...»"
The last point I wanted to make was that respondent,
and the Court, of Appeals both said that perhaps the final
legislation didn't ratify the guidelines because Representative
Kastenraeier said on the floor of the House that the final
legislation was a compromise.
But the compromise is evident simply by comparing
4206(a) to

4206(d).

The House had proposed a presumptive

parole provision, under which prisoners would be released after
one-third of their sentence, unless there were good reasons
not to release them.
The Senate on the other hand wanted the guideline
provision.

The Sanata got its way in 4206(a), and the House

got most of what it wanted in 4206(d); there's a presumptive
release decision, but it applies after a prisoner has served
two-thirds of his tarn.
And that was the compromissa.
QUESTXOMs

Are there any prisoners who, in this

setting, sentenced to five years, maximum, who may b© kept in

44
prison for longer than five years by action of the Parole
Board?
MR. JONES:

The Parole Board has no discretion to

keep a prisoner in prison after his sentence has expired,
even-QUESTIONS

sentence is the absolute maximum ©f confinement, is it not?
MR. JONESs

That's correct.

The Parole

Commission

only exercises discretion within the period that he8s lawfully
held under the sentence.
QUESTION?

It is correct, though, isn't it, Mr. Jones,

that the Parole Commission attaches no

weight whatsoever to

the sentence given by the trial judge?

It's not a factor at

all in its formula?
MR. JONES:

It is not a factor thai the Commission

considers under the guidelines.
QUESTION %

Only to the exten t that i t imposes either

a minimum or a maximum? other than that, it’s totally
irrelevant?
MR, JONES:

It determines the eligibility for parole,

but it doesn't determine the Commission's exercise of
discretion.
