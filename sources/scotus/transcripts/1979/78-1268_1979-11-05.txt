MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

next in Martines against California, No. 78-1268.
Mr. McGrath, I think you may proceed when you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD McGRATH II, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. McGRATH?

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Courts
The instant case involves three participants, one
an innocent 14-year-old--or 15-year-old girl? the other
a hopelessly and terrible sexual psychopath? and the third,
his legal guardian, state parole officietis of the State of
California.
The two former individuals' ps.ths crossed in
Tecolot® Canyon, San Diego, California, in August of 1975,
and Mary Ellen

Martinas came away the loser, for she was

brutally murdered by June-Jordan Thomas.
Thomas, on the other hand, was returned to the
place from which he never should have been released, the
State prison.
Indeed, had this bean a case of owners of a
dangerous animal who allowed that animal to get loose and
do injury, we would have long since had a verdict favorable
to our clients in the lower court.

4
This individual was released in spite of the fact
that in 1969 he terrorised young females of the same age
category that Mary Ellen was in.
QUESTION?

Well, you don’t claim that the

defendants here, or the respondents, should be treated as
if they were the parents or owners of the criminal
actor t do you?
MR. McGRATH?

I do, Your Honor.

I think the

Chief Justice, whan he was on the Court of Appeals, stated
in a case called Kaiser v, Reed that there is a parens-»»
patria relationship between parole officials and prisoners.
QUESTIONs

It was quite a different setting,

wasn't it?
MR. McGRATH:
purposes of argument.

But it was a good quote for the
I think that—

[Laughter.3
MR. McGRATH:

—Your Honor, it isn't that much

different.

They let these people go when they know they're

dangerous.

And the restatement

tells us that someone who

is in charge ©f a known dangerous entity or animal or
person and releases that person should be held liable for
the consequences of the actions of the person released,
QUESTION:

The restatement isn't talking about

public officials.
MR. McGRATH:

It doesn't delineate between

5
categories of people.

But it ho3„d@ responsibility or

accountability for someone under your control who is
hopelessly, incurably insane is released in the public,
there must be liability, Your Honor.
QUESTION?

Well, what if a judge, faced with

these same facts, had decided to grant probation rather
than

sentence and confine, and the next—10 days later

the person commits another rape?
Would you say that the judge was liable?
MR. McGRATH:

I would say so, but I would follow

the law in Stump v, Sparkman and say he cannot be liable.
He's absolutely immune.

But only that class of individual?

not this class.
QUESTION:

How--why is there that much difference

between them?
MR. MeGRATH:

Because the procedural safeguards

set down by this Court in the Butz case say4, we look to
see what due process is available.

With the judge, there

is appeals, there is transcripts, there is right to
counsel, public hearing, open courtrooms!.
This little girl, the only thi.ng she did wrong
was put on her sandals.
QUESTION:

And she never had any of those things.

Well, the--nobody had any right, to

appeal when a judge sentences someone, says, "I'll give
you probation instead ©f putting you in jail for 10 years."

6

The State has no right to appeal that.
MR, McGRATH:

But the public policy set down by the

Court in Stump v. Sparkman and Imbler, and no further yet,
is that the judiciary must be kept separate.

The judiciary

is faced with an inherent conflict of interest in hiring
counsel from the executive branch.
These officials are executives.

And they don't,

in their own realm, they're not voted in, they're not
elected, they're not controlled by anybody,
QUESTION:

Aren't wa talking--doesn't my brother

Rehnquist suggest—his present question suggest, at least,
that we're talking about two different things, or both—two
separate things, and intermingling them?
On© is, have you stated a causa of action under
Section 1983?

And would you have stated a cause of action

against the judge in my brother Rehnquiat's hypothetical?
And feha second is, even if there is a cause of
action, is this particular defendant immune?
Now those are two quite separate questions.

And

don't—let's not mix them up,
MR, McGRATH?

It's a difficult area for us, Your

Honor, but I agree with that,
QUESTION:

I know it is.

But I think it’ll be

less difficult if we keep the two questi.ons separate.
MR. McGRATH%

All righto

On the first question,

7
I say Scheuar v, Rhodes? exact same factss

wrongful

death? violation 1983? parents asserting rights? cods
sections the same? our wrongful death the same as the Ohio
statuta»
QUESTION s

I thought Scheuer v, Rhodes involved

only the immunity of the defendant, didn't it?
MR» McGRATHi

But, Your Honor, that's where I

have trouble, is to determine whether the defendant is
acting in good faith,
QUESTIONs

Well, first of all, let's-—if there

was no question of this defendant being immune from suit,
the question would still remains

Have you stated a cause

of action under 1983?
MR. McGRATHs
QUESTIONs

Yes, sir.

And conversely, if there were no

question but what you had stated a cause of action under
1983, the question still remains?

Is this particular

defendant immune from suit, or immune from liability under
1983?
Those are two quit® separate questions.

And as

you say, it's a difficult enough case without mixing
those two questions up.
MR. McGRATHs

Yes, Your Honor .

We've stated a cause of action under 1983 for the
deprivation of the right of this little girl's life.

3
QUESTION?

Weil., that's a question which your

brother greatly argues,
MR, McGRATH?
QUESTIONi

Yes, sir.

Mr. McGrath, it's a deprivation of life

without due process of law, isn't that the—
MR. McGRATH:
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.

What is the failure to follow due process

that the defendant is guilty of?
MR, McGRATH?

The defendant knew, or should have

known, as the Court said in Wood v. Strickland, that the medical
people, the psychiatric people, in California said Thomas
was hopelessly incurable.
And Judge Neilsen, when he sentenced him, said
"Don't let him out until you either cure him or the full term
goes by."
Instead, they let him out in four years instead of
twenty.
QUESTION?

Wasn't there soma evidence or soma prac­

tice of letting people out at a certain stage of their
incarceration that would support the deeiuion to—wasn't it
arguable as to whether or not he should have been let out?
MR. McGRATH?

No, I don't—I think that it was

arguable that a lot ©£ prisoners .got out early because of an
overcrowding situation.
But this man was medically incurable.

And I take

9

him as a separate, distinct individual.
QUESTION:

But doesn't that

go to the merits of

the decision as to whether t© grant him parole, rather than
the procedure followed by the Parol© Board?

Are you

challenging the procedure that the Parole Board followed?
MR. McGRATH2
QUESTION:

I'm challenging—

Whan you say thera was no du© process of

law?
MR. McGRATH %

Yes, Your Honor, I am challenging

the procedure.
QUESTION:

Then what was the error in procedure

that you allege?
MR. McGRATH:

They ignored his known dangerous pro­

pensities, and the fact that he had not bean cured.
QUESTION:

That's not procedure.

MR. McGRATHs

Well, the steps—X suppose you can—it's

mixed procedure and substance.
QUESTION:

They made an incorrect decision.

Is

that an error in procedure?
MR, McGRATH:

They ignored their own procedures in

that they should cheek to see that a person was safe to let
into the community.

They did not check to do that.

I mean,

he was not safe.
QUESTION:

Well, safety is a conclusion, isn't it?

MR. McGRATH:

The problem was--

10
QUESTION?

Whether he's safe or not is a conclusion

which the trier of fast must reach, isn't that so?
MR. MeQRATHs
trier ©£ facts.

Yes, sir.

I'd like to get to the

We'v© never"-so many of these questions I

can’t answer, because we were stopped, as was Scheuer, and—
QUESTION:

Mr. McGrath, doesn't the case come to us

on the assumption that there was a violation of constitutional
rights?
MR. MeGRATHj
QUESTIONs
immunity.

Yes, sir.

Tha basis for the decision below was

And so we approach it on -fell© basis that ©van

if there was a good cause of action stated, even if there
was a knowing violation, a deliberate violation, there is
immunity.
Isn't that the basis of this?
MR, MeGRATHs

I believe that's the basis, and I

think that's what Justice Stewart was trying to tell me to
confine m© to.
QUESTIONs

On the other hand, your opponent urged

that the judgment below b© upheld on the grounds that there
was no violation of constitutional law.
MR. McGRATHs

Well, that's why I said that I

thought Justice Stewart put me in a position where I had to
answer both questiones

A, a fundamental right to life? B,

what standard of immunity, be it absolute, as the State

11
wishes—State* a attorney, ©r be it qualified, as the Chief
Justice held in Seheuer,
The fundamental right is a right to life that’s been
denied.

And, as Justice Whit© says, we—you take our facts
*>

as true, so we*vei stated a cause of action.

Now, what’s the

standard?
QUESTION s

But your Scheuer argument seems to me

to lack a good deal in analogy, because there the National
Guard troops were at least arguably the agents of Governor
Rhodes,

And here, certainly, th© person paroled was not the

agent of th© Parol© Board,
MR, McGRATH s

No, but the parol ling officer was the

agent of the higher authority of the State, just,

as was
y

Governor Rhodes,

.

•

X don’t have any trouble with-—

QUESTIONS

Yes, but don’t you have a break in

causation of some sort when you get to a’private individual
who is—-by hindsight, obviously, mistakenly released, but who
is not a stats employ©©, who is detained against his will
by th© Stats for a period of time and than finally released?
MR, McGRATHs
Guardsmen,

No, sir, no more than the National

I think the Sdieuer case is harder than our ease,
QUESTIONs

You didn’t join the parole officer as a

defendant?
MR, McGRATHs
officer?

The—after the fact, the supervisory

Is that what you mean, Your Honor?

12
QUESTION:

Yea.

MR, McGRATH: We have numerous Does but—-and we
suspect a lack of supervision of this individual, and we've
generally pled it.

But we don't know the name of his parole

officer, for we were stopped at the demur stage in the lower
court.
QUESTION:

Well, are you pinning the ease not on

release but on lack of supervision?
MR, McGRATH:

1 think we’re pinning-primarily the

answer is yes, Your Honor.

But we're alleging in the

alternative, as we’re allowed to do under our law and under
Federal law, each and every cause of action we suspect.
But supervision subsequently, we suspect there was
a lack of supervision,

And we'd like the opportunity to

discover that issue,
QUESTION:
that, the judges?

In California, whose responsible for
Do they supervise the control--the probation

officers?
MR. McGRATH:

No, the Parole Department, an

executive branch, supervises the parole or probation officers,
It's an executive fmiction, not judicial.
We state, Your Honors, that in contravention of
this man’s known dangerous propensities he was released into
the community prematurely.

The Martines family asked, by

filing their complaint, and believed, that there was a violation

13
of Section 1983 of the Civil Rights

Act.

They further

believe that the Fourteenth Amendment, the du© process clause,
had been violated.

They believe they could prove the facts

they allege in their complaint, and they believe the right
to life was violated and was a fundamental right.
They believe these officials should be held
accountable , just as was the Governor and/or the National
Guard in Scheuer v, Rhodes.
They were turned down by all of the courts of
California.

Accordingly, we are here.

Immunity has been held to be the exception? accounta­
bility, the rule.

This Court has not allowed 1983 to be

circumvented by immunity claims.
It's bean so held in Scheuer v, Rhodes, in Wood vn
Strickland and in Procunler v. Navarette.

Indead, this

Court held in Buts that the burden of proof was on the state
to show the n©@d for an absoluto immunity.
We return again to Scheuer and state, our claims
are exactly the same.

For therein, they claimed an absolute

immunity, the Governor did? therein, the esas© was prematurely
dismissed at the very earliest stage? therein, the Governor
abused his discretion, called out the National Guard, an
injury occurred; herein—
QUESTION:

In the Rhodes case, Scheuer v. Rhodes,

did Ohio law purport to grant absolute immunity to the

14
defendant?

MR. McGRATHs

As X recall it did not.

Th© subject

was argued, but the holding*»»
QUESTION*

It. wasn't as elearcut aa California law

is in this case then? was it?
MR. MeGRATH:

No, sir, it was not.

And they ware

in a Federal court? v?s're in our own state court.
As 1 recall th® briefs of appellant, there was a—
it was not & claim of absolute immunity.

What form it came

under, 1 don’t recall, Your HGnor.
QUESTION:

But was there reliance on state law, as

there is in -this ease?
MR. MeGRATH t

I
Yes,, there was as to the executive

function, and the emergency of th© Governor needing to call
out the National Guard, the lack of foreseeability: calling
out National Guard, would that kill students at Kent State?
Our cade, we think, is better on the-QUESTION:

Well, then it’s a matter of the merits

again, not of immunity, isn’t it?
MR. MeGRATH:
we’re not always

Yes, Your Honor.

Being

on appeal,

sure just exactly what you want us to

address.
Thera, in Scheuer m here, there was a wrongful
death action.. There, there were violations of 1983 fundamental
rights.

We believe 'Uhls eas® is on all fours with Sehauer v.

15
Rhodes.
W© understand the state's position is that parole
is a difficult decision* and there’s a lot of discretion
involved.

W© have a hard time understanding how there would

be more discretion in parole than being the Governor of a
state of this Onion,
We think that if the state's position is carried
to its logical conclusion* then the cases allowing policemen
to be sued must be overruled.

For policemen have the ultimate

discretion*much more so than parole officials.

They can take

a life in an instant? they can take liberty in an instant.
We don't think that’s the Court's position.

We

think the state in Navarett© v. Procunier* admitted that the
same Procunier we sue here today was only qualifiedly immune
by admission in Navarette.
Here* Mr. Procunier claims absolute immunity.
We believe the test of Wood follows* that these
parole officials knew* or should have known* when they
released June-Jordan Thomas, that he would have committed a
crime similar to the one committed* and hi® victim was more
foreseeable than

wess

the students in Scheuer v. Rhodes.

For

indeed* Thomas had molested girls of .tender age„iji Teedlot©
Canyon in '69? as soon as he was released* shortly thereafter*
he returned to Tecolote Canyon and killed a girl of tender
age.

16
QUESTIONt

Mr, McGrath, just so I can be sure 'I have

your ease* you’re--we!r©

only concerned with the fifth cause

of action in your complaint * is that not correct?
MR, McGRATH:

Yes, Your Honor, and its incorporation

of the other causes of action,
QUESTION;

The other allegations.

Is it perfectly clear to you that the California
court rejected th© fifth claim on the basis of the California
immunity statute?
MR. McGRATH §
QUESTION;

Yes, if is.

Because they just end up by saying there’s

no liability to plead under th® Civil Rights Act.

And I think

it’s arguable in thoir opinion that they war© just saying
there’s no cause of action under the Federal statute.
MR, McGRATH:

I didn’t feel they said that.

I felt

they said that in tills fact situation, that absolute immunity
was appropriate to achieve th© goal of the state,
QUESTION:

But they don’t cite the statute in ttielr

rejection ©f that---the fifth claim, in that portion of their
opinion.
MR. McGRATH:

It may not be in that particular

portion, but I found them discussing 1983 fairly carefully at
one point.
QUESTION:

In Federal casas on immunity.

MR. McGRATH:

Yes

17
QUESTION:

Fitzgerald v. Procunier.

MR. McGRATH:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

But I--the question I’m asking you is, I

don’t really think it’s fair to say they relied on the
California statute in disposing of that claim.

That9s what I

really wanted to suggest to you.
MR, McGRATHs 1 can’t say I agree or disagree.

I

don’t they discussed it.

QUESTIONS

Yes.

MR. McGRATH:
you

But when you lose at that level,

don’t think they even saw the 1983.

impact of it,

Honor, was the test.

What

Let’s see if he was in good faith.

If not, we create a

rebuttable presumption.
And, as Justis® Burger said, then we go to summary
judgment, and it gets tougher.
But I think we should be able to go back and rebut
that presumption of good faith.

And w© think the Grimm v.

QUESTIONs

Yes.

MR. McGRATH:

But should they have, with knowledge

of the facts?
QUESTION:

That's quite a different inquiry.

MR. McGRATH:

Esseuse roe, Your Honor, did you have

any—?
We would ask that we would return to the San Diego
Superior Court to try and litigate our case.

We realise we

have a difficult burden of proof? indeed, we could lose tills
case.
But w® would like to go back with a good faith
qualified immunity applicable to these parole officials.

We

would ask that the gross negligence standard set down in
Grimm be at least the standard applicable to the instant
case.
We would state that Economou v. Brocnnier was a
case of negligence, and that still is the law in the Ninth
Circuit.

And therein, a prisoner's mail was opening in

violation of his First Amendment rights, and it was negligently
opened.
Herein, we have the taking of a life.

Accordingly,

a good faith gross negligence standard would no be unreasonable,
nor would a negligence standard.
Following the principles, Your Honors, that no man
is above the law, set down by this Court, it would place

20
these equal-—these people In an equal position with every
other citizen, that of being held accountable for their actions
and for the natural consequences of their actions, as stated
by

Justice Douglass in Monro© v. Pope.
QUESTIONS

Well, judge are above the lav/, according

to Stump v. Sparkman.
MR, MeGRATH:
the judges are the law.

I think what the Court says is that
And that’s easier for me to say.

Because judges aren’t above the law.

They are the law.

Nobody is above the law, according to U.S. v. Lee.
QUESTION:

Well, but judges may make just as

botched up decisions as parole officers.
MR. McGRATH:

But they don’t have—the parole

officers don’t have the inherence conflicts that do judges.
I mean, you’re cping to have to get an attorney from the
DA’s office to help you, and there he is prosecuting? you’ve
got a terrible conflict built in.
And somebody must be the law.
are the law.

Judges and prosecutors

Parole officers aren’t officers of the court?

they don’t have public hearings.
Finally, and most importantly, the victim is the only
class of person not asking for and receiving due process to
date by this Court.

By a decision in favor of the Martinez

family, the victim would finally be accorded due process due
him.

21
Indeed, this Court has extended the protection of the
Constitution, to every minority, to every class, and to
every known entity except the victim.

That’s not because the

courts turn down -the victim, it’s because this is the first
time the victim has really been hare.
It is respectfully submitted that if this country
is to maintain the tradition that no man is above the law,
and that government is indeed the servant and not the
master of the people, then it is desirable to do away with
the ancient notion that the king can d<i no wrong, but his
servants can do it for him.
We think that the drafters of the Civil Rights
Act and of the constitution would have it no other way.
QUESTIONs

Mr. McGrath, I just have to question you

once more about this notion of being above the

law.

There’s no suggestion that, in anything other than
the performance of his regular job, this individual, or indeed
the Judge in the Stump case, was above the law.
The question is whether the law gives a damage
remedy when someone is performing his official duty? isn’t
■that the issua?
MR. McGRATHs
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.

Yens.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Miller.

22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. MILLER , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES.
MR. MILLER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court;
I'd like to turn initially to the question of
immunity.

In the 1983 eases handed down by this Court,

this Court has indicated that as part of its analysis we
should enter into a considered inquiry into the immunity
accorded the relevant public official at common law, and the
public policy considerations in favor of that immunity.
Turning to the history, the judicial history, of
Section 1983, and the question of immunity, with respect to
parole officials and their determinations to release
prisoners, on parole, we see near-unanimity in the Federal
/

opinions.
The Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Circuits
have all unanimously held that there's an absolute quasi-judicial
immunity which attaches to a parole official in connection with
his determination to release a prisoner.
No Federal Court of Appeals has decided to the con!

trary.
We’ve cited in our brief numerous opinions issued
by the Federal district courts for the same proposition.
We've quoted extensively from the cases of Wright v. Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania and Pate v. Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.

23
In both of thosecases the question of Section 1983 immunity
for parole officials was placed in issue as a result of a
parolee being released into society and either killing or
seriously injuring a member of the society.
And in both of those eases the absolute quasijudicial immunity was held to apply.
Against that rather unanimous backdrop of application
and recognition of the quasi-judicial immunity for parole
officials for a determination to release a parolee into
society, the appellants have been able to cite only two cases,
namely the cases of Grimm v. Arizona Board of Pardons and
Paroles,
D.C.

and Semler v. Psychiatric Institution of Washington,

Semler was cited by amicus on behalf of appellant.
We would submit that neither one of those cases

is relevant to the issues in this case.

In Grimm the Arizona
f

Supreme Court cho®@ that as a vehicle to abolish what had
previously existed as a common law rule in Arizona immunizing
all diseretionary--all administrative officials in connection
with discretionary activity.
Rather than engaging in an analysis of the common
law history of quasi-judicial immunity accorded parole
officials, rather than determining the public policy
considerations in favor of that immunity, the court based
its decision solely on the question of, in what branch of
government the position of, quote, parole official, reposed

24

in Arizona.
And finding that it reposed in the executive or
administrative branch, it held that therefore judicial
immunity, or quasi-judicial immunity could not attach.
In the case of--we 11

it comes as no surprise to

us that the majority opinion in Grimm was mocked by the
dissent and has not been followed by any other jurisdiction.
In Semler v. Psychiatric Institute, cited by
amicus in support of the appellants, the Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals held that a probation officer could be liable
under Virginia common law in connection with a ministerial
act of negligence consisting of participating in the
transference of a dangerous mental patient from a high-risk,
high-security facility to a facility of lesser security.
QUESTION:

Before you proceed, General Miller, may

I simply ask, was the Grimm case a 1983 case?
MS. MILLER:

No, Your Honor, it was not a 1983

case.

MR. MILLER:

Yes, I understand your feelincr that it

was necessary to mention it.
MR. MILLER;
QUESTION;

Also—
But am I correct in saying that it

didn't involve anything except state tort law?
MR. MILLER;

Yes, you're correct, Your Honor.

After—after an inquiry into the judicial history
of the immunity accorded the relevant public official, we
must engage in an analysis of the public policy considerations
in favor of applying an immunity.

And before engaging in a

parity of reasoning between quasi-judicial immunity on the
part of judges and prosecutors, which this Court has
recognized in cases we cited in our brief, I'd like to make a
few remarks concerning the unique discretionary nature of the
parol® process.
This Court, in 1972, in the case of Morrissey v.
Brewer, indicated that for the past 60 years the process of
releasing prisoners on parole had become an integral part of
our penological system? that the purpose of parole is to
reintegrate officials into society as constructive individuals
as soon as they are able, without confining them for the
terms of the sentence imposed, and that the process of parole

26
mitigates the cost to society of keeping people incarcerated.
In the recent case of Greenholta v. Nebraska Penal
Inmates, decided May 31st of this year* this Court painted
a very comprehensive picture of the unique and discretionary
nature of the parole process.

The Court all but implied it's

a fragile process,, still in the experimental stage, and it
consists of a synthesis of record fact and personal
observation of the parole official, filtered through the
sum total of his experience, and resulting in an equity type
of judgment, taking into account psychological, sociological,
biological and genetic factors of the individual under
consideration? and that that kind of decision does not always
lend itself to traditional findings of fact or conclusions of
law.
It emphasizes not what a man has done, but what a
man is and what a man can become.
against that

And it8s against—it* s

backdrop, that critical and unique purpose of

parole, that we must engage in an inquiry of the public policy
considerations in favor of granting quasi-judicial immunity
to parole officials.
In 1967, this Court, in one of its cases, recognised
the common lav; immunity v;hieh bene fitted judges from civil
liability in connection with the 1983 action.
Pierson v. Ray.

That was

Ancl in 1976, in the landmark case of Xrobler v.

P&dfetan&n, this Court extended that rule of immunity to State

27
prosecutors upon the rationale that to permit angry or
disgruntled litigants to file lawsuits against these
officials alleging reckless or improper conduct would have
a chilling effect on these decision-making processes.

And

that chilling effect would result in harassment and
intimidation, rather than fearless and principled decisionmaking.
QUESTION:

General Miller, let me go back to Sender.

I take it you feel your case is just as solid if we went
along with the principle in Sender?
MR. MILLER:

First, Mr. Justice Blackmun, we can’t

see how the principle of Sender is at all relevant to this
kind of an inquiry.
QUESTION:

Well, as I read the Court of Appeals’

decision, they didn’t stop at the break that Sender would
represent, to wit, the ministerial act as distinguished from
the other.
MR, MILLER:

My understanding of the opinion was

that the official in question was not exercising any
discretionary or quasi-judicial function in that case, but
was merely engaging in a ministerial kind of activity and—
QUESTION:

And therefore I ask you whether the

Semler decision is at all embarrassing to your decision? and
I take it yonz answer is no?
MR. MILLER:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

2B
QUESTIONS

Isn *t it also true with respect to

Sender that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
looked to Virginia law, and if one were to perform the
analogous function here of looking to California law, clearly
California law says there should be no liability.
MR. MILLER2

That’s true, Your Honor,

And further­

more, with respect to that point, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in
Sender, a Fourth Circuit opinion, the Court of Appeals in
that case did not modify, nor even question, its own rule of
absolute quasi-judicial immunity that it had already recognised
in favor of parole officials in connection with a determination
to release or to deny release, to a parolee.
We believe there’s a parity of reasoning between
the public policy considerations in favor of prosecutors
and judges and granting them immunity and granting a
quasi-judicial immunity

for parole officials.

As it liras foreseeable on the part o£--in the
context of a state prosecutor that numerous lawsuits could
be filed by unhappy litigants unable to accept the wisdom of
the result of a particular case, we can perceive a multitude
of lawsuits being filed by victims of violent crime committed
by parolees who will transmute the loss, the shock, the
wrath, and the other emotions they’ve suffered into ascriptions
of reckless and improper conduct against a parole official,
allegations that are easily made and, in the absence of a

29
total quasi™judicial immunity, can only be disproves* with
a full evidentiary hearing.

That would deflect a great deal

of energy and time on the part of parole officials from
making these important decisions to defending past
decisions.

.And in some cases, decisions that have taken

place years before they will have to come into court and
establish to the satisfaction of a jury good faith.
That imposes an intolerable burden.

Furthermore,

the Court indicated in Irabler that it would be highly improper
and risky to permit lay juries to pass on technical issues
such as prosecutorial strategy of what witnesses to call, what
evidence to seek introduction of, what kind of a case to
prosecute.
We feel there's a parity of reasoning there.

Because

if we were to open up the door even a crack to liability on
the part of parole officials under 1983, juries would be
expected to resolve issues such as the—all of the
individualised and highly subjective issues which argue in
favor of release for a particular individual.
The jury would be responsible for assimilating the
sum total experience of a parole official.

For as Greenholt^

instructs, the process of parole is a synthesis of record
fact and personal observation of the parole official filtered
through his own career, his own experience.

A deprivation of liberty claiscad by

MR. MILLBRs

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that would

certainly be a logical result; and 'that would even create a
greater burden on this vital aspect ©f our rehabilitation
process.
We feel that under that kind of pressure—we feel,
in tlie initial ease, that any prospect of liability under
1983 for the determination of a release ©f a prisoner,
whether it comes from a member ©£ the public victimised by
« parole®, or from an inmate who has been denied parole, would
create a chilling process--©, shilling effect ©n the ability
of the individuals to exercise the vast amount ©f discretion
4

we repose in the® for the purpose of vindicating this aspect
cj:f ©ur penological system.
W© feel-getting bask to the question ©£ the
incredible burden that we would impose on juries, w@ feel
that juries would be presented with all kinds ©f highly
technical and improper decisions for them to make, such as
the predictability ©f violens® in general terms, and also

38
iln specific terras with r@sp©ct to a particular paroles?
iiad that ultimately they would foe required to eossa up with
the ultimat® finding c-f fact, in the form of a jury verdict,
« process which this Court has already acknowledged is not
appropriate for the kind of determination that a parole
official will have to make.
These decisions will fo@ made in an ©national melting
pot, with the benefit of 2®*»2© hindsight? and it'll fo® easy
for a jury to ascribe rookies® conduct or improper conduct
on the part of a parole official in an emotional reaction to
the gravity of the of fans a that was committed.
So our position is that w© should not—we should
stot submit parol© officials to make this treacherous choice
of

opting for continued confinement for their own personal

protection on the one hand, and opting for the release of
am individual into society at the risk ©f incurring

personal liability.
W@ feel that that would have a drilling effect on
this decision-making process, and result in thousands upon
thousands of inmates throughout the penal institutions in
our country worthy of parol© being incarcerated longer for
unjustifiable periods of time.
Furthermore, if we were t© impose liability under

39
Section 1983 ia this particular set of circumstances, and
appellants have argued that se should impose liability
only for gross negligence or recklessness, we would in
effect b© creating a privileged class of crime victims,
ilf yon «Till; those people victimised by recidivistic acts
committed by parolees who have been released as a function
of gross negligence or other grievous misconduct.
Crime victims who suffer at the hands of parolees
who haves,91 been released a® a result ©£ any improprieties
would have no redress under 1983, nor would people victimised
by probationers, or first tlma criminals, for that matter.
QUESTIONS

Under California law, 1 assume that the

victim here had a tort cause ©f action against the actor,
whether or not h© was judgnentaproot I suppose might be a
question; but there9® no question of immunity ©a the part
of th® person who actually raped her?
MR. MILLER:
absolutely correct.

Mr. Justice Behnquist, that9&
Th® statute in question in si© way

abridges the common law right of th© individual t© proceed
against a parson who committed the offense.
ted furthermore, in California we feel that, w®
dealt with—or wec r® in. th® process ©f dealing with the
separate question of compensating people in a more appropriate
«tanner than imposing liability on the part of parole officials.
In California, we’ve adopted a comprehensive

40
sicheme known as the Victim of Violent Crimes legislations
whereby we compensate# t© a limited degree# and within the
ijs©nfc©&t of special damages suffered by individuals# victims
of all crime#

not just crime committed by released parolees

or released probationers or first "-time criminals.
*

Furthermore—and this gets into the area of what
alternative means there are which might be preferable to
flection 1983 in California at the time this happened. and at

th® present day# wa can promptly remove a parole official
who is incompetent or can • t ©nereis® his—-th® diseration
that is reposed in him# er for any other reason.

We can also

«•©due® th© amount of discretion that we vast in parole
officials# and provide for e greater involvement of interested
la?!' enforcement agencies and# indeed, the public# as we've
<!!one in California.

fhar®6® been s©$a@ suggestion that because of th®
absence of formalistic judicial safeguards the parol©

process is not—is—should be controlled by th© imposition
of tort liability upon parol® officials.

jy»d in their briefs

the appellent® made reference t© the quasi-judicial—hot th®
quasi-judicial# but th© judicial safeguards enunciated by

this Court in Buts v„ Eaenomou# and indicate that in th© @fost©ne© of that kind of safeguard liability should b© imposed
as a necessary check.
First ©£ all# th© Buts opinion itself did not impose

41
«s a condition precedent the existence of any judicial safe­
guards on the Federal administrative law process before
it granted—before it decided it was to grant quasij udici&l immunity to administrative law judges and prosecut­
ing attorneys

within the executive branch of the Federal

Government.
tod furthermore? as this Court has indicated in
Stump? particularly in footnote 12 of Stump? there are" all
kinds of activities in which a judge may engage which ar©
outside the adversarial process? such as the decision
to issue a search warrant? or issue an ex parte order such
as a temporary restraining order,

tod there are n© procedural

safeguards at that particular time? but we have still
recognised absolute immunity in that kind ©f a context.
Within the context ©f prosecutors, we will totally
immunize the® for many of their decisions which are ex
parte? wif you want to call it that? in nature? which are
not made within the contest of the adversary process, such
©is a decision of when t© prosecute a case? what css® t©
p2r©ss©©ut@? what evidence to seek introduction of ©ad what
witnesses to call.
Finally? w© turn to the subject that the parole
decision itself really does not lend itself to the
adversary process.

It's a quasi-»judicial jfunction outside

the traditional mold ©£ adjudication? as the Court indicated

42
.to Greenholts g ®nd there ©re all kinds of equitable, and
to tangible, and highly subjective factors to be taken into
liiceomt, ©sad the process results in an equity kind of
predictive judgmentf not a traditional finding ©£ fact.
It’s been likened by this Court in Greenholts
■I» the sentencing judge9s choice, and in Williams v. Hew
York this Court held that in the contest of sentencing there
urere no due process ox other requirements which could justify
Idle injection into a sentencing process of the right to
(sounsel ©r formalistic rules of widen©©? baeaas® if that
'irere dons* as the Court recognised in Williams9 we would
have a situation where judges would not h® abls to rely on
information in which—upon which 'they traditionally roly
for that important decision, such as probation reports and
other in fonts hi on.
The Court indicated that .that kind of infcreation
iron91 normally ©as»

in under classic rules of evidence.

It

furthermore will impose © great burden ©n«=-a gr@®t cost burden
on society.
My final reaark with respect t© appellant to
contention that w® reed judicial safeguards in this area
‘.is that if wa were to impose that kind of condition,, we

]
feel that it will be done at the risk ©f creating a greater
self consciousness c£ the quasi»j udlclal function ©f th®
parole decision, which in and of itself could have a

43
chilling effect ©a the process.

It coaid b© transformed into

a prosecutorial environment where th© emphasis would not

on continued and unjustified confinement.
