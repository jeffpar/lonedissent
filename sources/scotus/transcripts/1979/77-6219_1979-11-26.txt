PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 77-6219, Baldasar v. Illinois.
Mr. Mulder, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MULDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MULDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case concerns an Illinois conviction of a
petitioner sentenced for theft under an enhanced penalty
statute.

The charge that the petitioner was facing was the

theft of a dial massage shower head, having a value of less
than $150.

He was charged with taking that from Montgomery

Ward on November 13, 1975.
Now, this information also charged as an additional
element that this was his second theft conviction, the first
occurring in May of 1975.

Ordinarily, under Illinois, had

there only been one theft conviction charged In the statute,
the punishment would have been classified as a misdemeanor
and he would have been punished by up to less than one year
with no parole and the incarceration could have taken place
In other than a penitentiary.
However, in Illinois, under this enhanced penalty
statute, upon a second conviction the penalty would be class!
fied as a felony punishable one to three years, with two

years of automatic parole followed, and that also the incar­
ceration would occur in a penitentiary as opposed to a jail
or another institution.
QUESTION:

Has that sentence that was actually im­

posed been served as yet?
MR. MULDER:

Yes, it has been served and the parole

term has also been served, Mr. Justice.

We are arguing for

a — here we are attacking the conviction and I believe that
the Court has held that even though a sentence has been served
we can still attack the felony conviction.
QUESTION:
MR. MULDER:

You feel that the case is not moot?
I do feel that the case is not moot.

•There are ramifications of the case.

;

For example, under the

j

|
Illinois statute,the new sentencing statute, the petitioner
could be exposed to an extended term upon conviction of the
same class felony on the basis of his prior felony, and this

j

statute involved there Is chapter 38, section 1005-5(3)(2)(b),
and also 1005-8-2(a).
There may also be ramifications with regard to the
petitioner's future employment on the basis of this

felony.
.

Under Illinois lav;, a license may be refused to issue on the
basis of this felony, and as an example of that the sections
for dentists —
QUESTION:

Is that the sort of thing that this
.

Court has taken into account in determining whether or not a

5
case is moot?
MR. MULDER:

I think that the case in the past base

on these ramifications would be Ginsberg v. New York, which
is found at 390 U.S. 629, possible ineligibility into employ
-

ment was looked at by the Court there.
QUESTION:
MR. MULDER:

Well, is Baldasar a dentist?
No, he is not a dentist.

What I am

trying to make a point here, Your Honor, is that it may affect
his future employment, that it does have a ramification for
future employment.
QUESTION:

How about voting, can felons vote in

Illinois?
'
IS

MR. MULDER:

I believe in Illinois that they can

vote after the sentence has been imposed.
QUESTION:
FIR. MULDER:

Or served?
Or served, yes, I'm sorry, after it

has been served.
QUESTION:

What about a tax driver's license, would

he be barred from getting a tax driver's license?
MR. MULDER:

I think there are a number of licenses

where he may not be barred but where it may be taken into
consideration.

That is a general wording of the statute in

Illinois, that it may be taken into consideration.
QUESTION:

Don't some Illinois statutes take into

consideration the fact that whether or not you were indicted

6
for a crime, whether you were convicted or not?
MR. MULDER:
QUESTION:

Not to my knowledge.

I think that —

Or convicted of a misdemeanor?

MR. MULDER:

Not to my knowledge on that either.

I

think most of them read conviction of a felony.
QUESTION:

What is Mr. Baldasar’s vocation?

MR. MULDER:

Mr. Baldasar is a semi-skilled worker

and I believe at this time he is working in a factory but I
am not sure exactly what his employment in the factory is.
Your Honors, at trial there was an objection to the
entry of this prior misdemeanor conviction which was uncoun­
seled.

The basis of the objection was Burgett v. Texas, and

:

defense counsel made the objection stating that she felt that
the evidence would show that he was not represented by counsel;
at the prior misdemeanor proceedings, but that the state had
an affirmative showing to shot'; that he was represented.
What happened was that the court overruled the ob­
jection and said that this did not apply to felony proceedings.
On appeal, the conviction was affirmed over the dissent of one
judge.

Our petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois
i

Supreme Court was denied, and this Court granted certiorari
'

on the question of whether the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments
prohibit the use of the prior uncounseled misdemeanor convic­
tion which did not result in imprisonment to increase the
sentence of imprisonment on a subsequent conviction under an
i

7
enhanced penalty statute.
QUESTION:

Is there any question but what the

original misdemeanor conviction which did not result in im­
prisonment was proper under the United States Constitution?
MR. MULDER:

There is no question that under Scott

v. Illinois that it was proper and a valid conviction. Your
Honor.
I think in sum our argument is that the prior un­
counseled conviction, even though valid for purposes of a
fine, is not valid for purposes of incarceration.
QUESTION:

Would you contend that if a judge in his

sentencing had a range in the indeterminate sentence approach
and the pre-sentence report excludes all the facts that are
disclosed in this case, that he was constitutionally barred
from taking that into account in fixing a sentence?
MR. MULDER:

I think that the Sixth Amendment would

prohibit that under Tucker v. United States.

I think that

that is much closer a question than our case at bar now be­
cause in our case at bar the imprisonment flows as a "but for"
consequence.

In other words, when you face the enhanced

penalty situation in Illinois, upon that second conviction
being proved up, the judge has a whole new range of options.
Instead of less than one year, he now imposes one to three,
with the parole to follow.

But I think the problem with your

-- with that argument, which I believe the amicus makes, that.

8
if hearsay statements can corae into the presentence report
and if arrest reports can come into the

presentence report,

why can’t we use these uncounseled convictions which are at
least as reliable as that.
Ordinarily, when counsel approaches the bench at
such a sentencing hearing, he can argue that the hearsay isn’t
worth very much or that the arrest record doesn’t mean very
much„

But the problem with the amicus argument is that they

want to use that conviction for full value, they want to treat!
it like any other conviction with counsel, and I think that
is the real danger involved.

So I think the better approach

—■ and again I think the analogy can be made to Tucker v,
United States -— is that that shouldn’t flow from the con­
viction.
QUESTION:

Does the jury sentence in Illinois or

does the judge?
MR. MULDER:
QUESTION:

The judge does, Your Honor.
Well, how do you distinguish Williams v.

New York?
MR. MULDER:

Well, I think in the same manner that

Tucker v. United States distinguished Williams, and that was
that where there was no counsel at that prior conviction, the
court, would look at it in a different manner and therefore
it could not be used at the sentencing hearing.

And I think

what our argument is that it is not reliable to impose

9
imprisonment and therefore should not be looked at at the
sentencing hearing.
QUESTION:

Even though at the sentencing hearing

the judge can look at all sorts of hearsay that wasn't put to
nearly the test that this uncounseled conviction was at the
time of trial?
MR. MULDER:
closer case.

That’s true, and admittedly it is a

But I think if we can say from the sentencing

hearing that the additional imprisonment resulted from that
prior uncounseled conviction, that the better approach would
be not to use it.

But again I say that the consequence, the

collateral consequence in our case is a lot more direct.
is the "but for" causation.

It

And I think the analogy to

Burgett can be made.
In Burgett, it was reversed on the basis of an invalid conviction under Gideon v. Wainwright.

Admittedly, as

I spoke before, the conviction here is valid but the defect
in Burgett was the lack of counsel, and that is the same de­
fect that existed here.

And our argument is that the fact

that imprisonment was imposed on Burgett does not add any
reliability to that conviction*

In Burgett, the court found

that Burgett was suffering anew from that uncounseled con­
viction.

And although petitioner Baldasar did not suffer

initially imprisonment, he is In a sense suffering imprison­
ment for the first time at the subsequent proceeding, so

10

that he too suffers anew from the uncounseled conviction,
QUESTION:

Well, there is a difference between this

case and Burgett, isn't there?
MR. MULDER:

Clearly, there is a difference in that

in Burgett the conviction was invalid and here the conviction
is valid.

But our point is that the defect underlying the

reasoning in Burgett was lack of counsel, and he has no
counsel at that prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction*
The amicus and the respondent seem to take the
argument that the central premise of Argersinger was imprison­
ment

and I believe that It is true but it can't be looked at

out of the context.

I think what has to be taken into accoun--

here is that it was not only imprisonment but it was a
decision involving the right to counsel, and that when
counsel was provided the assurance of reliability and the
*

degree necessary to Impose imprisonment would be available
upon that.
I

More simply, I think what we can say is that where
a fine is acceptable, it is acceptable because a worse con­
sequence has been removed.

A counselless conviction for a

fine, the worse consequence of imprisonment has been removed.
And I think what has happened here is that the imprisonment
has been imposed at a later date, but that doesn't make the
conviction any more reliable by the mere fact that it has
occurred some place down the road.

11
QUESTION:

But what it Is being imposed for, what

the new imprisonment is being imposed for is the fact of a
prior conviction which was legal.
MR. MULDER:

That's true, but under Illinois -- and

I don't think, you can get away from the fact that part of the
charge — and I think the state's argument that he is being
punished only for the second offense is perhaps correct, but
you have to look at the element, and part of the elements
charged in this offense is the first one, is the first prior
uncounseled conviction»
QUESTION:
MR. MULDER:

Which was perfectly constitutional.
Perfectly valid for only the purpose

of fine, not for the purpose of imprisonment.

If so, like in

Burgect, the defendant suffers anew from that uncounseled
conviction.

The only difference is here he is suffering for

the first time.
The contributions, of course, that counsel can make
in —
QUESTION:

Well, would he be suffering in any dif­

ferent sequence if the sentencing judge were taking this into
account in the hypothetical we discussed earlier?
MR. MULDER:
QUESTION:
MR. MULDER:
that

Going back to the hypothetical?
Yes.
I think he would be — if we could say

12
QUESTION:

Would he be suffering then for the first

time in your terms for what you consider his first conviction
which you concede is valid?
MR. MULDER:

Yes, I think he would be suffering for

the first time if you could say in your example, Mr. Chief
Justice, that additional imprisonment arose from that prior
uncounseled conviction.
QUESTION:

It is a harder —

But I thought you conceded that the judge

could take that into account under Williams v. New York and
cases since then.
MR. MULDER:

We don’t concede that, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I thought you had.

QUESTION:

Well, the reason you would give for say­

ing that the uncounseled conviction in this case couldn’t be
used to enhance Is that although valid it was — there was
sufficient unreliability about it, that It shouldn’t be used.
MR. MULDER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
And there was sufficient unreliability

because counsel wasn't there.
MR. MULDER: That’s correct.
QUESTION:

And you say that although valid it was

unreliable.
MR. MULDER:

I think it was reliable enough for

purposes of a fine.
QUESTION:

So you say it is unreliable.

13
MR. MULDER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Correct.

Unreliable to prevent its use to enhance.

MR. MULDER:

That's correct, and I think that goes

back to the reasons that Gideon and Argersinger were based on
and that is the contributions that counsel can make at those
proceedings.

He can assess the terms of the statute's con­

stitutionality, he can move to suppress unconstitutionally
seized evidence, he can help the defendant determine whether
.
a jury —
QUESTION:

What would you say if there had been a

waiver of counsel at this prior —
MR. MULDER:

I think reliability can be waived and

I think that is what the cases hold, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

By reliability, you mean counsel can be

waived.
MR. MULDER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

\

It doesn't make the conviction —■ it

makes the conviction valid, but it doesn't make it any more
reliable.
MR. MULDER:
QUESTION:
MR. MULDER:

Correct.
But you would still say you could use it»
I would say it could still be used if

a waiver was shown, but I would again argue that under1 Burgett
that is the state's affirmative burden, to show any waiver,
and that the record shows here that he was not represented by I

I

14
counsel.
The respondent In the amicus claim that is the pe­
titioner prevails in this case, that there will be confusion.
I would suggest to the Court that a rule could be easily
applied here and simply applied:

If the state seeks to en­

hance imprisonment3 they must show that the prior conviction
that the defendant tvas either represented by counsel or
waived counsel.
Further, they claim that it is very difficult for
the prosecutor or the trial court judge to predict whether or
not this conviction would be used sometime down the road.

I

would, suggest to the Court that it is not a hard decision to
make that prediction and it is based on some of the same
things that they predict initially on whether to grant the
petitioner counsel or not, and that is the nature of the
offense, the circumstances involved, whether there was
violence or injury to any person, and whether a pattern of
criminal conduct is developing.
If those things appear, then the tate can keep their
option open to use this at a later enhancement, to use this
as later enhancing the sentence by providing counsel0
Finally, I would like to address the Court on the
matter of cost.

First of all, I would say that if it is

true that the Sixth Amendment prohibits the use of these
convictions, then cost may be irrelevant.

But the amicus and

15
the respondent argue it, so I would like to address it.
I think one thing that is clear if the Court agrees
with our position, and that would be that the same option
that was left open in Argersinger and Scott still exists.
That is that if the state chooses not to provide counsel, it
doesn't have to.

It can simply forego the option of imprison

ment so that no cost would result to the state In that situa­
tion.
The other thing that I would point out with regard
to

—--

QUESTION:

Well, from the cost point of view,

though, the reason for the state foregoing the cost in the
initial round where there isn't any threat of imprisonment is
that it is just a great big three-million square-mile country
where it isn't always that easy in lots of non-metropolitan
areas to obtain counsel.

So that if you are going to have a

trial at all, even on the misdemeanor, you may well have tc
have it, if you are going to have a speedy trial, without
counsel.
MR. MULDER:

Well, that is true but it doesn’t add

any additional cost to the state to continue to maintain that
system.

Even under Argersinger —
QUESTION:

But it does add a cost to the state if

you are going to say that, sure, you can maintain this
system but you. can’t have a recidivist statute based on it,

16

or you can’t ever take that conviction into account in a
second sentencing of what is clearly a felony.
MR. MULDER:

Two points I think with regard to that.

First, we are not saying here that the state can’t have a
recidivist statute»

We are merely saying that if they do,

on the ba.sis of misdemeanors, they have to provide counsel
at that first proceeding.
And my second point with regard to that is I think
we are talking about a problem here that As a lot smaller in
scope than in Scott.

We are not asking that counsel be sup­

plied in every misdemeanor conviction.

For one thing, there

are many of them that don't have an enhancement provision
attached.

So I think we are really talking about a much

smaller —•
QUESTION:

But isn’t one of the concerns of criminal

justice experts in the country now this problem of the re­
peater, and isn’t that why states have responded with enhance­
ment statutes?
MR. MULDER:

Oh, I think that is a definite problem.

But I think if we are going to penalize the repeat offender,
we ought to provide counsel to make sure that that conviction
has tie necessary degree of reliability to result in this
case in two extra years of imprisonment.
QUESTION:

Well, if you prevail I suppose you would

also argue that in any case like this, even if there was

17
counsel provided in the prior misdemeanor case, you should be
able to litigate whether counsel was adequate in the later
enhancement proceeding.
MR. MULDER:

I don’t believe that is true.

I don’t

think that Burgett v. Texas and Loper v0 Beto go that far,
Your Honor.

I think that —

QUESTION:
MR. MULDER:
QUESTION:

It sounds to me like yours does, though»
No.
You are arguing reliability.

If the re­

liability rather than a seemingly valid conviction is the
test

I would think you would say this conviction is invalid

because counsel was inadequate,
MR. MULDER:

Well, I don’t think the cases go that

far so that that would be permitted.

But why I think that at

least a facial shotting that counsel was there is required
unde3° those cases Is because the right to counsel makes the
other rights, the other due process rights that a defendant
has meaningful.
Your Honors, we would request that the Appellate
Court of Illinois be reversed in this case.
Thank you.

I would like to reserve the remaining

portion of my time.
MR.CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Weinstein.

Very well.

18
ORAL ARGUMENT OP MICHAEL B. WEINSTEIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WEINSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
At the outset, I wish to stress that this case does
not involve situations where "but for" the counselless convic­
tion the petition would not have been Incarcerated,
if he;

for even

were tried in this case without the use of that first

conviction, he would have been subject to incarceration for
up to 36^ days.

Thus the case really involves an increase in

the length of incarceration and not the fact of incarceration
itself.
With regard to Mr. Justice Blaekmun?s question as
to whether or not the sentence had been served, I had con­
tacted the Illinois Department of Corrections Just last week,
they did advise that the sentence had been served.

Mr.

Bald isar served a total of one year and six months and one
day Incarceration.
Your Honors, the petitioner has never challenged
the reliability of the first conviction —
QUESTION:

Would he have served a sentence that

long If there had not been a prior conviction?
MR. WEINSTEIN:

If there had net been a prior con­

vict Lon, Mr. Justice Stevens, and we were talking simply
abou : the misdemeanor theft conviction, he could have served

19
up to 36^ days.
QUESTION:

So the answer is no.

MR. WEINSTEIN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

I understand the parole period has also

expired?
MR. WEINSTEIN:

The parole period has also expired,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Was that true in the Argersinger case,

do you know?
MR. WEINSTEIN:
QUESTION:

I really do not know, Your Honor.

Or in other cases that were vacated and

remanded under our decision in Argersinger?
MR. WEINSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Why isn’t the case moot?

MR. WEINSTEIN:
Your Honor.

I really don’t know.

That is an interesting question,

I really —

QUESTION:

I would think you would be arguing chat

it was.
MR. WEINSTEIN:

Your Honor, I had not frankly con-

sidered the question of mootness because I did not know that
the petitioner had even served his total period of time until
just last week.
QUESTION:

The conviction was some time ago, it

would seem to me to stand right out on the papers.
MR. WEINSTEIN:

Well, the conviction was I believe

20
late in *76.

If he served the full three years., we would be

talking about him possibly being released now.

He would

still be serving the mandatory parole term of two years.

So

in theory it could have gone on for two years from now.
QUESTION:

Well, under the applicable law there is

still some consequences of his conviction, some civil conse­
quent es?
MR. WEINSTEIN:

The only possible consequences

woulc. have to do with possibly the licneses, the occupations
he mi ght be barred from.
about the taxi license.

I believe Justice Burger asked
I think in Chicago they are barred

from having a tax license*
QUESTION:

We had that case.

QUESTION:

Well, are you now urging mootness as we

suggested It to you?
MR. WEINSTEIN':

Well, Your Honor, I am really not

sure.
QUESTION:

Would you not have to argue that a con­

victed felon has no interest in clearing his name?
MR. WEINSTEIN:
QUESTION:

I agree. Your Honor.

He probably does have some interest.

MR. WEINSTEIN:

I think there is some interest.

I

think there is a great question Involved here that this Court
If it didn't face today would in fact face at a later date.
QUESTION:

But that has never been deemed as

21

sufficient answer in this Court to the case ir. controversy
requirement article three, that you have a live case or con­
troversy between the people, even though it is perfectly
obvious that it is going to be back in another form with other
parties two or three years from now.

That does not give this

Courl jurisdiction to decide a moot ease now.
MR. WEINSTEIN:

I understand that, Your Honor.

If

in fact this Court feels the case is moot then clearly it
should not be decided.
The petitioners never challenged the reliability of
his first conviction other than his general arguments as to
the ( uestion of reliability.

In other words, in the Illinois

»

Appe!late Court he did not even raise any question of reliability.

He has never talked about this first conviction

having been factually inaccurate.

Perhaps the defendant did

a poor job of examining witnesses, that type of question.
He has simply stated today or in the briefs filed
in this Court that their first conviction lacks reliability,
However, the petitioner has always conceded the validity of
that first conviction, and in fact he conceded that validity
even prior to this Courtfs decision in Scott v, Illinois or
he c<needed it in the Illinois Appellate Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Weinstein, on that point, of course,

he concedes it for purposes of the fine.

He doesn't say

that it is one of the bases for imprisonment.

Supposing he

and Cook County.
counties.

The two misdemeanors were in different

Suppoing the two complaints had been filed close

together in point of time and the second complaint had already
been filed before he was tried on the first complaint,

so

that it was a matter of public record that he was subject to
possible enhancement if he were found guilty on both occasionsi„
In the first trial, would there have been a duty to provide
counsel?
MR. WEINSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, if the complaint

had already been filed, the complaint itself would have had
to have alleged the prior conviction.
QUESTION:

That’s right, but he would still be pre­

sumptively innocent, of course.
MR. WEINSTEIN:

Exactly.

Therefore, I would assume

that the complaint could not later be amended, assuming, for
example, that he is convicted on the first case without
counsel or with counsel, that it could be later amended to
charge that first conviction»
QUESTION:

Do you mean if there were a conviction

on the first complaint but before the second complaint were
tried, you couldn’t amend the second complaint to add the
additional fact?
MR. WEINSTEIN:

Well, I would imagine it would

depend upon how close we were to trial because to include it

23
would change the entire crime involved from a misdemeanors as
we have on its face, to a felony where the person could be
incarcerated for a longer length of time.
QUESTION:
tion?

Well, what is your answer to my ques­

Do you think the state would be under a constitutional

obligation to provide him with counsel in the first trial.,
knowing that a second misdemeanor charge is pending?
MR. WEINSTEIN:
QUESTION:

No.

Our —

Your position is that it would still

not
MR. WEINSTEIN:

Exactly, Your Honor.

Thus, the entire argument that the petitioners made
simply stated is that his uncounseled conviction, his first
uncounseled conviction has now ended up in incarceration and
thus Argersinger has been violated.
However, it is our position that an uncounseled
misdemeanor conviction which is valid under Scott, clearly
valid under Scott, like any other valid conviction, can be
used

'or certain collateral purposes, qne of which is sentence

enhancement»
We believe that any other conclusion would substan­
tial y undercut this Court’s opinion in Scott and would
create untold confusion among state and federal courts as to
the possible collateral uses of valid convictionso

For ex-

ample, as the Chief Justice indicated, we believe that a

24
ruling in petitioner's favor would lead to similar challenges
as to whether or not a prior counselless conviction could be
used in a presentence report, whether it could be used for
purposes of impeachment, the same type of situation that did
arise after* this Court’s decisions after

Burgett and Loper

and United States v. Tucker.
Furthermore, we believe that the predictive evalua­
tion by the trial judge would become an administrative night­
mare for the judge would have to evaluate not only the
aspects of the case beforehim, that is the particular aspects
of that case, but he would also have to keep in mind, the
possibility of preserving enhancement possibilities in future
cases„
I suggest that a judge would in effect have to have
a prophecy to make that determination»

I think it is quite

possible even that a conservative judge might appoint counsel
in all cases.
QUESTION:

Would that be terrible?

MR. WEINSTEIN:

No, I don't necessarily believe it

is terrible, but I don’t think it is required by this Court's
decision in Scott.
QUESTION:

What if that would be the result, would

that influence you?
MR. WEINSTEIN:
of ■—

Then we are back into the arguments

25
QUESTION:

Many states do precisely that, you know.

MR. WEINSTEIN:

Many states do.

However, we felt

both in Scott and in this case that counsel was not required
at this first indemeanor conviction as long; as incarceration
did not result.
Therefore, we believe that a decision in favor of
the petitioner could well lead to appointment of counsel in
all cases due to either cautious judges or perhaps cautious
prosecutors, a result which this Court rejected in Argersinger
and specifically in Scott.
With regard to the amount of sentences that might
be involved here, the Illinois Supreme Court noted at least
thirty enhancement sentences in Illinois that would be
relevant.

The amicus has done a brief survey of those sen­

tences around the United States as well as in the federal
system, and I think we are talking a.bout more than just a
minor amount of sentences.

\

Thus there would be substantial costs to the state
and to the judicial system,

the same types of costs which a

majority of this Court recognized in Scott, and therefore
?

chos

not to require counsel at misdemeanor convictions not

leading to imprisonment.
The instant sentence therefore is a direct result
only of a second conviction.

It is not a delayed or addi­

tional punishment for the first uncounseled conviction.

Additionally, it is the petitioner's voluntary act of com­
mitting the second theft that most directly led to his in­
carceration for one to three years.
i

As to reliability, Burgett and the later cases of
Loper and United States v. Tucker dealt with convictions
which were presumptively void under Gideon v. Wainwright.
There is no question but that a void conviction is clearly
unreliable.

However, here the petitioner could have attacked

his first conviction via direct appeal, a post-hearing act,
a quorum novis petition, or perhaps federal, habeas corpus.
The fact that he chose not to is further indica­
tion, indeed possibly a presumption of its correctness0
*

<

The respondents believe that under the facts presented herein* the counselless conviction is no less reliable
from a conviction obtained after perhaps a waiver of counsel
or a Faretta situation where defendant insisted upon his
personal right to represent himself,,
QUESTION:

Well, that would involve a waiver, too,

wouldn't it ?
MR. WEINSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

That would involve a waiver also.

MR. WEINSTEIN:

Yes, that would involve a waiver»

I simply say that in the positive way because that is the way
it was stated in Faretta, where the opposite term, simply
waiver.

27
To insist that a conviction is valid yet unreliable
simply does not make any sense.
In summary. Your Honors, the respondents believe
that a ruling in favor of the petitioner would only open up
a "pandorafs box" at substantial costs to the criminal
justice system and to society in general.

Moreover, we be­

lieve that it would completely abrogate this Court’s previous
decisions in Argersinger and Scott.
Therefore, Your Honors, we respectfully urge that
this Honorable Court affirm the judgments of the Illinois
courts.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume here at

1:00 o'clock, if you have any rebuttal.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o’clock noon, the Court was
in recess, to reconvene at 1:00 o’clock p.m.)

AFTERNOON SESSION •— 1:00 0*CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Mulder, you may

proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MULDER, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER --- REBUTTAL
MR. MULDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I wish to respond to two points.

First, the

Attorney General has claimed that his position has not changed
since the argument in Scott.

As pointed out In our reply

brief at page two, at that time the Attorney General said in
Scott, when prosecuting an offense the prosecution knows that
by not requesting that counsel be appointed for the defendant
he will be precluded from enhancing subsequent offenses,

I

think the —
QUESTION:
MR. MULDER:

Who said that, Mr. Mulder?
The Attorney General of the State of

Illinois said that in Scott v. Illinois.
QUESTION:

You don't suggest that binds any other

litigant here or binds this Court, do you?
MR. MULDER:

No, I do not suggest that it binds

this Court, but I think for the respondent to claim that it
takes a gift of prophecy to apply the requested rule Is
seriously undermined by that statement which recognized that
it could be easily applied in a previous ease.

29

QUESTION:

The Attorney General of Illinois or any

other state when he has a case here is out to win that case
and not some other case, isn’t that the usual procedure?
MR. MULDER:

That is the usual procedure, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And he can hardly bind, his own court

either.
MR. MULDER:

No, he cannot.

Your Honors, the second thing I wish to point out
»

is that the Attorney General has also argued the cost factor
to the court but no figures have been cited, and we would
ask this Court not to speculate on this issue.

Where liberty

is at issue, we don’t believe that cost is a relevant factor
to be concerned with»
We are asking this Court to preclude the use of un­
counseled prior misdemeanor convictions for enhancement
purposes and reverse this case for a new trial*
Thank; you.. Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted*
(Whereupon, at 1:02 o’clock p.m», the ease in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
