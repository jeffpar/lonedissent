PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-5705, Trammel v. United States.
Mr. Wiggins, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. TERRY WIGGINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WIGGINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This matter comes on for review of this Court as
the result of the conviction of Otis Trammel, Jr., the pe­
titioner herein, for aiding and abetting the importation of
heroin from the Philippines into Hawaii and the United States
find for conspiring with others, approximately nine persons
named in the original indictment, for the importation of
heroin into the United States.
It resulted from the arrest of Elizabeth Trammel
on November' 6, 1975 in Hawaii , as she entered the country
carrying a substantial quantity of heroin on a trip in from
Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines.
Trammel's arest, she was alone.

At the time of Mrs.

She was told that she was

charged with a serious felony and she was offered the volun­
tary opportunity of cooperating with the government in ex­
change for being charged with a misdemeanor and a recommenda­
tion of probation or, in the alternative, being Jailed for
the felony for which she had been arrested,

4
She elected the latter alternative and Indicated
that she would cooperate with the government, notifying the
Customs agents at that time that she intended to take the
heroin to Colorado, to deliver it to an individual by the name
of Roberts who was then stationed in Colorado Springs,
Colorado.
That was done under a controlled circumstances and
at the first statement given by Mrs. Trammel to the Customs
authorities in the Drug Enforcement Administration at that
time, she did not in any way implicate the petitioner here,
Otis Trammel.
After the controlled delivery took place in Denver,
Colorado, and Mr. Roberts was arrested together with a Mir.
Richardson, Mrs. Trammel was sent on at that time and still
told that her cooperation would be necessary and in exchange
for her cooperation she was being offered a misdemeanor and
a recommendation of probation.
She was again interviewed at Denver and at that time
once again she did not implicate her husband, the petitioner
here.

Finally, approximately a month to six weeks after Mrs.

Trammel’s arrest, she was interviewed in Birmingham, Alabama,
which was her family home, at that time she Implicated her
husband as the part of an importation conspiracy and as an
aider and abettor.to, the initial importation for which she
had been caught and she was notified once again that she

5
would have — that her cooperation with the government would
be recognised and that she would receive leniency for that.
QUESTION:

If she had implicated her husband at the

very first time she was approached by the government, would
your case be any different?
MR, WIGGINS:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I don’t know

that it would be any different, but I —»
QUESTION:

You spent considerable time pointing out

the fact that she took a while to consent.

I didn’t see how

that was directly involved with the legal principle.
MR. WIGGINS:

Well, I think it is involved with the

legal principle is the principle that the government tries in
their brief and 1 assume by argument here today to convince
this Court that there should be an exception to the husbandwife privilege, that being the voluntary consent of the
witness spouse or on® of the parties to the marriage.

If that

were to be an exception, It seems to me that, voluntariness
becomes a serious question and her voluntariness is certainly
subject to consideration when she in two prior interviews
does not notify the authorities of his participation and only
ultimately, with all of the offers on the table, she finally
agrees to or she talks about him and agrees to testify against
him.

It is hard to call that in my estimation voluntary.
QUESTION:

Well, in the two earlier interviews, had

she said he did not participate or had she simply not said

6
anything about it?
MR. WIGGINS:

I think she had neglected to mention

him in the earlier interviews.

She mentioned more people

as time went by apparently to get a better deal.

The ulti­

mate deal she got is she was not charged with any crime nor
convicted of anything; in fact, she was given witness im­
munity in exchange for her testimony.
QUESTION:

Well, in ordinary plea negotiation

situation, Mr. Wiggins, where there is no husband and wife
problem or the testimonial aspect you have here, do you
regard the testimony of the witness who cooperates with the
government as Involuntary?
HR. WIGGINS:

In certain circumstances, Mr. Chief

Justice . I think it must be viewed as involuntary but
whether it i3 voluntary or not I think certainly represent­
ing a defendant charged as a result of such plea, negotiation,
it would be the right of counsel in most circumstances to
bring that put, bring out the negotiations, to point out
what that person has traded for his testimony, and juries
are instructed, it has been my experience, to weigh that
testimony very carefully vrhere an accomplice is involved,
because those people have a self interest.
QUESTION:

To come back to my question, do you

regard that as Involuntary?
MR. WIGGINS:

In certain circumstances, yes,

7
Your Honor.
QUESTION:

In what circumstances would you

characterize it as involuntary and in what would you
characterize it as voluntary?
MR, WIGGINS:

Certainly, Mr, Chief Justice

where witness Immunity is granted to a witness who does
not want It, that is Involuntary.
QUESTION:

Certainly —

Well, did she not want it here?

MR. WIGGINS:

No.

You asked me for a circum­

stance where I would find it to be involuntary.

I think

she wanted it here.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WIGGINS:

Certainly it would seem to me in

a situation where a person is offered to either be charged
with a serious felony and serve time in prison as a result
of that charge or in the alternative to become a witness
j
and not be charged with anything and. serve no time,, I
think there is coercion.
QUESTION:

Can you suggest any situation in

which the defendant, the possible defendant so testifying
is coerced into accepting immunity?

Can anyone be forced

to accept immunity?
MR. WIGGINS:

A oerson can be granted immunity

without their permission.
QUESTION:

Can they be forced to accept it?

8
MR. WIGGINS:

No5 they can elect contempt of

court as opposed to the accepting of the Immunity and
actually testifying.
QUESTION:

Well, if they don't want to accept it,

they simply take their chances as a defendant and stand
trial, isn’t that the usual pattern?
MR. WIGGINS:

Not entirely, Mr. Chief Justice.

I have seen people granted immunity who didn't want it and
would just as soon have stood trial and x*ho opted for con­
tempt as opposed to willingness to testify.

That has

happened and that is a circumstance where a person didn't
want it but nonetheless the result is the same.
Some two months after Mrs. Trammel or three
months after Mrs. Trammel was caught entering the United
States with heroin, the defendants were indicted, three
defendants were indicted and six persons were named as
unindicted co-conspirators in thl/s case in count two

/

which was conspiracy to import heroin.
Priox* to the trial of the lawsuit, the matter
wa3 here before the court and husband-wife privilege was
raised by a motion to suppress, requesting the District
Court Judge -■

a motion to sever, excuse me, requesting

the District Court judge to sever Mr. Trammel from the
other two defendants who were then charged so that Mr.
Trammel could claim his privilege in an independent trial.

9
The whole point of the hearing, however, was strictly the
privilege question and at that time the District Court
judge refused to recognise that such a privilege existed
and the government argued that no such privilege existed,
and the District Court judge indicated that Mrs. Trammel
would in fact be required to testify.

Subsequently,

within approximately three days, the trial began.
Mrs. Trammel was called to testify, a motion
and order granting immunity were given her, and again the
petitioner, Mr. Trammel, raised the question of the
husband-wife privilege and once again the court said that
the ruling of the court would be the same and basically
not recognizing the privilege, only recognizing a communi»
cations privilege and noting that the communications
privilege would be fully enforced and that she would not
be able to testify to privileged communications.

/
In addition, at the time that this matter was
argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit, the government once again, according to
the Circuit Court's opinion, took the position that the
privilege that I am here to argue today just didn't exist
in effect.

The Circuit Court of Appeals found that the

privilege did in fact exist but took the position that
because of the fact that she was a co-participant or a co­
conspirator in the ease, and also because of the fact that

10

she was granted witness immunity, that she should have
been permitted to testify and that it did not violate the
precedent set forth In Hawkins v. United States, which
is the last case in which this Court came face-to-face
with the privilege that is before the Court today.
In the Hawkins case, the Court held, this Court
has held that the privilege was an absolute one, of one
spouse to keep the other spouse off the witness stand and
that that privilege took precedence over, in the ease of
Hawkins at least, the conviction of Mr. Hawkins, his wife
was called to testify against him and who was, I think it
is clearly arguable from the case and clearly notable
within the case, that his wife was herself a co-participant
at least to the degree that she was running the house of
prostitution to which the young lady being transported
across state lines was to go at the conclusion of the trip
and may well have been an alder and abettor, may well
have been a eo-conspiratior in that case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wiggins, maybe it is shown by

the record, but I didn't see that.

m. WIGGINS:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I think the

opinion shows that she was running a house of prostitution
in the state in which the young lady was going, and I think
It also shews that that is where the young lady ended up.
'Whether or not she was a participant is subject to some

11
speculationQUESTION:

I thought it only showed that she

was a former prostitute.
MR. WIGGINS:

I didn’t realize that ~
I think the record also indicates

that — I think the report of the case also indicates
that she testified that the young lady was coming to her
establishment.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. WIGGINS:
privilege

At any rate3 Hawkins made the

it is my position an absolute privilege, the

government argued at that time the same thing that the
government argues before this Court in its brief nows
that the privilege should reside in the witness spouse
rather than the defendant spouse, and that the witness
should be the one to make a voluntary determination as to
whether or not he or she should testify when his or her
spouse is accused and on trial.
argument in Hawkins, and

1

This Court rejected that

urge that it be rejected again.

I would also note that it is clear from the
legislative history of the rules of evidence that this
Court took the position in approximately 197^ when the
rules of evidence were being considered by the Congress,
this Court sent up rules of evidence and the husband and
wife privilege sent up by the Advisory Committee was
identical to the privilege that is presently set out in

12
Hawkins.
QUESTION:

You don’t regard that kind of a de­

cision as equivalent to a holding of the Court, do you?
MR. WIGGINS:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I don’t,

but it does seem that it would have been, if the Court
were inclined to change the Hawkins situation, that the
rules of evidence — it would have been an ideal time to
formulate a rule that was more consistent with the Court’s
thinking.
QUESTION:

Well, what did Congress do about

that suggested rule?
MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

Excuse me, Mr. Justice —

What did Congress do about that sug­

gested rule?
MR. WIGGINS:

What Congress did was it took the

13 rules that -were sent up on privilege and got rid of all
except one.

Congress rejected both the Advisory Committee's

suggestion of rules as well as the Justice Department’s
suggestion of the —
QUESTION:

And then came up with one rule, 501?

MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And said that privilege shall be left

to the common law process?
MR. WIGGINS:

They say it should be left to

common law as determined by reason and experience, the

13
same thing they —
QUESTION:

Do you think then what Congress has

done to date, that we would be forbidden to overrule
Hawkins?
MR, WIGGINS:

Yes, Mr. Justice White, I think

you would be —
QUESTION:

Not by 501?

MR. WIGGINS:

Not by 501, but 1 think by Title

28, section 2076, that you are in fact forbidden, at least
arguably so from overruling it, and I have to confess
that —
QUESTION:

We wouldn't be overruling it by pro­

posed rule.
MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

It seems to me that If —

This 2076 deals with the rulemaking

process —
MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

That's right.

— and all the evidence rules except

privilege would just have to --* would go into effect
within l80 days unless one House or the other acted.

Rut

any changes by rule about privilege, Congress would have
to affirmatively approve.
MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And I take it that would be whether

you created a new one or overruled an old one.

MR. WIGGINS:
one.

Or abolished or modified an old

But because privilege is set out specifically in

2076 as having to have the approval of Congress, and be­
cause the only thing relative to privilege In the rules of
evidence. Rule 5019 the only thing relative at all to
\

privilege Is In that rule.
QUESTION:

It seems to me that —

Well, Rule 501 is utterly meaningless

because It i3n*t left to the common law process.

2076

leaves it to the legislative process exclusively.
MR. WIGGINS:

It seems to me that It does.

It

seems to me that —
QUESTION:

Well, 501 is utterly meaningless.

MR. WIGGINS:

If you read the two together, I

think you have to come to the conclusion that the Congress
is encouraging the Court to reconsider privilege but is
holding the string that they want to —QUESTION:

■ <r

We should decide a pas® and then send

it over to Congress to see if our decision should be —
MR. WIGGINS:

No, Mr. Justice White, I don't

think that Is what they are saying.
QUESTION:

Well, should we dismiss this case

then and say that we have no jurisdiction to entertain
your petition?
MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

No, I —

Or should we sumarily reverse on the

15
grounds that the Court of Appeals had no business tinkering
with Hawkins in light of 2076?
MR. WIGGINS:

That is strongly arguable, that it

should be summarily reversed for that very reason and that
the Advisory Committee on the Courts should be the ones to
recommend changes in the rules or the Justice Department
to recommend changes in the rules to Congress and that
Congress should act on them.
QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting then that

privilege questions are just non-justiciable?
MR. WIGGINS:
non-justiclable.

I'm not suggesting that they are

What I am suggesting is that unless the

last sentence in 2076 means nothing, it has to be read
with 501, and the only way they can be read together is
that rule changes must go through Congress.
QUESTION:

Well, every application of a privilege

rule that would — say there is a conflict that develops
between two Courts of Appeals.
MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

Now, can we resolve it or not?

MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

All right.

I think that that is your duty.

Or do we have to wait until Congress

resolves it?
MR. WIGGINS:
to resolve it.

I think that is part of your duty,

16
QUESTION:

Well, how can we?

We would be chanp;*»

ing the law in one way or the other*.
MR. WIGGINS:

Where privilege is concerned, you

might be required to reverse it were the Court of Appeals
to —
QUESTION:

Say it was 4-to-5 between the Court

of Appeals, they Just split 4-to-5.

Now, if we decided one

way or the other that the law would be changed in one group
of circuits or the other —
MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

— and It couldn't be changed until

Congress said or not?
MR. WIGGINS-

2076 seems to indicate that is a

fact, and I don't pretend to know that that is what it
means.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that Congress said they

were going to leave it to the courts, then leave it to the
courts to do what?
MR. WIGGINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, they said they

were going to leave it to the courts, at the same time
they enacted something that said the courts must come to
us for permission where privilege is concerned.

I can

only -QUESTION:

The courts or the rulemaking process?

MR. WIGGINS:

I think they are talking about the

17
rulemaking process.
QUESTION:

We aren’t sitting in a rulemaking

process now, are we?
WIGGINS:

Absolutely, you’re not, but we are

discussing a rule before this Court that was left in a
certain way by Congress as a rule they didn’t want changed.
I’m not arguing for the fact that a decision of this Court
In any way would have to be sent to Congress for the
Congress to say yes or no to it.

I am only saying that

that is the only suggestion that can be made from 2076 as
I read it.
QUESTION:

So I can only read you as. saying we

should ignore it.
MR. WIGGINS:

Unfortunately I had considered

that seriously when I came up here and suggesting that,
because it does seem to me to be inconsistent and no
consistent way for this Court to deal with It in this
case.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that they were advo­

cating anything other than how the rulemaking process
would function?
MR. WIGGINS:

No.

'They are advocating how the

rulemaking process should function.
QUESTION:

Not how x\re were to decide a future

case, as Justice White suggested, resolving a conflict in

18
the circuits?
MR, WIGGINS:

I agree with you there, not how

you should decide cases.
QUESTION:

So we should go ahead and decide the

case.
MR. WIGGINS:
in ray favor.

Yess Mr. Chief Justice, you should

But I also think that when they say that,

that it is perhaps somewhat presumptuous of the circuits
to then decide a case contrary to Hawkins and contrary to
the prior lav/ and say on a case by case basis we have de­
cided to change it when the Congress wanted to retain the
rulemaking power as a result of that statute.
that out because It Is there.

And I point

I am not suggesting in any

way that It is necessarily controlling in this case.
QUESTION:

How much weight do you put on the

suggestion that appears In the Hawkins ease and elsewhere

■ ;

I

that this has a deleterious effect on the marriage rela­

tionship when the husband or wife goes into court and
testifies against the other and perhaps sends the other
spouse to prison?

You recall, Justice Black seemed to

rest to a significant extent on that aspect.
MR. WIGGINS:
agree with that.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and I

I think I agree very strongly with the

statement that it was Mr. Justice Black's opinion at
that time that it would destroy almost any marriage for

19
one of the marriage partners to be called as a witness
against the other, and I think that is true regardless of
the outcome of the trial of the case, because it seems to
me if a spouse stands up and testifies in open court
against his or her mate, that the marriage is probably at
that point irretrievably shattered and would not return
to any semblance of trust between the two as a result of
the testimony.

So I think that the situation that Mr.

Justice Black suggests early on, I think that is still
the same situation today.
QUESTION:

The concurring opinion, suggested that

this whole concept was a relic of the past and has no
place in the modern world of women’s lib — not quite in
those terms.

What do you have to say about that?

MR, WIGGINS:

It is part of what Mr. Justice

Stewart suggested in the concurring opinion.

However, he

also suggested in the concurring!opinion, which I agree
very strongljr with, that no one case is the case that
should change this if it is a relic of the past, and we
submit that it is not, but that the Advisory Committee
for the courts should consider this matter seriously and
if a change should be made it should be an intelligent
change on that basis.
QUESTION:

We have changed some other doctrines

and rules of ancient lineage, haven’t we?

20
MR. WIGGINS;

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, we have.

There Is certainly no question about that.

But this rule

strikes at the very heart of the family, of marital harmony
which Is I suggest an institution of authority* a non»
governmental institution of authority in this country which
undergoes a significant amount of fire in today’s times as
a result of the way society operates, and I think that this
Court should strongly support the institution of the home,
the institution of marriage against attacks in this kind
of situation against that institution to testify and in
effect break the home.
QUESTION:

This case was tried in the District

Court of Colorado?
MR. WIGGINS;
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, it was.

What Is the law of Colorado?

Perhaps

you have already been asieed this, but if so I didn’t get
the answer.
MR. WIGGINS:
QUESTION:

The law of Colorado'is
•
XrWith respect to this question.

MR. WIGGINS:

—■ it would be identical to the law

in the federal court with respect to this question.

It is

the privilege of the accused to keep the witness off the
witness stand if the accused chooses to use that, utilize
the privilege.
QUESTION:

Not identical to the law in the

21
federal courts as construed in this case by the Tenth
Circuit,
MR. WIGGINS:

Correct, not identicals but

identical to what the Hawkins —
QUESTION:

The general Hawkins rule.

MR. WIGGINS:

The general Hawkins approach to

this particular privilege would be identical in Colorado.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume at

this point at 10:00 o’clock in the morning, Mr. Solicitor
General.
(Whereupon, at 3:00 o'clock p.m., the case In
the above-entitled matter was recessed, to reconvene on
Tuesdays October 30, 1979*, at 10:00 o’clock a.m. )
