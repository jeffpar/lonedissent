OF EG ARGUMENT OF AltAU I. HOROWITZ', ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF TOE PETITIONER
MR. HOROWITZs

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it

please the Court?
This case is here on a writ of certiorari from
the United Stata s Cour-5 . of A, peals for the Sixth Circuit,

It concerns the proper interpretation <

:

the statutory

provisions chat guarantee certain re-employment rights
to veterans upon their return to employment.
These provisions are now codified in 30 USC 2021.

The question here is how those provisions apply
tc the supplemental unemployment benefits, or SuS*s, that
are provided under the collective bargaining agreement
between respondents and the United Steel Workers.
Specifically . the question is whether the guarantee
against loss of seniority under the Act requires that the
time spent foy a vete

include cl in

i

time used to compute SUB9 s.

SUB7 s are payments that are made by the employer

to employees who have been lain off.

r lese payments are

over and above the unemployment conpenrt ation that tin
employee otherwise receives iron the State.
Under the SUB plan involved in this case, which is
set cut beginning at page 17 of the appendix, SUB payments
are made on a weekly basis for. a period of up to 52 weeks That period depends on the number of SUB credits that the
employee has accrued»
The amount of each weekly payment is determined
according to a formula set out in Section 1 of the plan.
That formula depends on several factors, including the
employee’s present salary and his number of dependents,, and
the amount of compensation that he receives from the state.
The formula does not depend on the anaivr.it of tine
that the employee has been employed.

Therefore, there is

no dispute in this case about the amount of each weekly
benefit that was received by petitioner.
What the dispute in this case does concern is the
length of the tine period over which these weekly BUB
payments continued.
of SUB credits»

This period is determined by the number

And these credits "are earned through the

passage of time, as described in Section 2 of the SUB plan,
on page 19.
One-half credit is earned per week.

An eligible

week for which one-half credit nay be earned is one in

which the employee has any of the following hours:

Hours

worked for the company; hours that are not worked but for
which the employee is paid—for example, vacation time, or
time spent on jury duty; and also, certain categories of
hours , not worked- and for which the employee is not paid
where the employee is performing certain duties for the
local union, or is on a certain specified disability leave.
then an employee is laid off and receives weekly
payments, he uses up his SUB credits.
Finally, under the plan, an employee is not eligible
to receive SUB payments at all, no matter how many credits
he has accrued, until he has two years of continuous
service with the employer.

As an example of how the system

works, if an employee began work for the company, and. worked
or engaged in some of these other eligible activities ,• for a
continuous period of a year and a half

and was than laid

off, he would have accrued 39 SUB credits by that time,
would be at the rate of one-half credit per week.

font

However,

because he had not reached the two year eligibility
threshold, he would not receive any SUB payments when he ras
laid off.
In this case

,

petitioner began working for

respondent in 1963, and worked for respondent for a period
of four and one-half months during that tine.

Ee was then

laid off, and he then left respondent9s employment,

lie had

5
accrued nine SUB credits during the tine the':, lie was
employed in '63.

Howeverf because he elected to leave

respondent s'3 employment, these credits were cancelled.
Ee then began to work for respondent again in
late January of '■

i] tied €o work for responder

until he entered military service in September of 1969.
He thus earned approximately 16 SUB periods—c.rouse me,
SUB credits—'during this latter period.
Ee served in

-the- military until August, 1971, wren

he was honorably discharged.
He was then reinstated to his previous position
with respondent.

However, because of respondent's economi

situation, he was immediately placed, in layoff status.

He

remained laid off for a period of nine and one-half months.
until July, 1972.
During the layoff period, petitioner received
SUE payments for approximately 16 weeks, corresponding to the
16 SUB credits that he had earned, before he entered the
Service.

However, he did not receive any payments for the

remaining five and one-half months that the layoff continued.
Had petitioner net entered military service and
continued in respondent's employment, the parties have
stipulated -that he would have had 52 SUB credits at the
time of his layoff.

Thus, he would have received SUB

credits—excuso nof CUB payments—for the entire duration of

7
his layoff.
%

The question

presented in this c;\... thenf is

simply whether petitioner should have had his military
service counted in determining his total of SUB credits
when he was reinstated following his military service.
Petitioner originally brought suit in the district
court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleging that the
failure to consider his Service time in computing his SUB
credits violated Lis statutory right.
The District Court rejected petitioner's
contention, holding that the SUB plan established a bona fide
work requirements for the earning of SUB credits.
Petitioner appealed, and while the case was pending
on appeal, this Court, handed down its decision in Alabama
Power Company v. Davis, holding that pension benefits are a
perquisite of seniority under the Act.
The Court of Appeals then vacated the District
Court’s decision, and remanded for reconsideration in light
of Alabama Power.
The District Court again held for respondent,
stating that, quota, entitlement to HUB benefit;- requires
more than continued status, such as r work requirement
demanding actual performance on the.job.
The Court of Appeals then affirmed for the u
stated by the District Court.

The relevant provision of the statute involved
here is that portion of 30 USC 2021 :’fo) {.].) that requires
veterans to be reinstated without loss of seniority.
If this Court finds that SUB payments are a
perquisite of seniority within tile neah.ln.n-

of that section f

then petitioner must be given credit for his Army service
tine in computing his SUB credits.
That is a consequence of two main principles that
were established in this Court's decision in Fishgold. First,
the escalator principle was established ? that is f that a
veteran who returns to his employment is to be reinstated
at the same place he would have been had he remained in the
employment, that is, at the place he would have beer, on

the

escalator had he remained in employment, not at the place he
got off the escalator when he entered the service.

Secondly, Fishgold also established that the
provisions of the Act are to be liberally construed for the
benefit of the.veteran.
In this Court’s decision in Alabama^ Power, it
established the appropriate analysis for determining whether
a particular benefit is indeed a perquisite of seniority.
The real nature of the benefit, is to be examined, and it i.
to be c

Simihed whether , on the one Ijandh the benefit i

primarily in the nature of a reward for length of service?
in which case.» it is a perquisite of seniority.

Or on the

other hand, whether the benefit is primarily a short-term
compensation for work performed.
Applying this test, severance pay a:

:

benefits have been held by this Court to be perquisites of
seniority.

Vacation

pay has been held to be primarily in

the nature of compensation for work performed.
Before I. turn to a discussion of those factors
that we believe indicate that SUB11 s should be treated as a
perquisite of seniority, I would like briefly to discuss
the notion of a work requirement upon vrich the District
Court and respondent have focused soma of their attention»
there is no dispute here that fuS credits are
primarily earned by employees who arc working.

This is

factually true of most benefits that this Court has dealt
with, whether they are determined by language in the collective
bargaining agreement, or whether it is determined by
language that refers to years of service.
Now, in Alabama Power the contention was made to
this Court that any benefit that is determined by a 'work
requirement,, that is, where a collective bargaining agrees:.ant
specifies that most of the employees who earn the benefit
will be working, should automatically dispose of any cont€r.ticn
that the benefit may fce treated as a p,

site q£ sene! rbf v,

The Court expressly rejected that contention in.
Alabama Power, and it noted that almost any benefit emir La

10
tied to a work requlrenent sue!’, as existed in

lie/;: case.

That would permit the employer himself to decide
whether a benefit was a perquisite of’ seniority, and 'the
employer, himself could decide whether the vetera:/:, was entitled
to have his service tone credited.
However? Congress has not left that decision up to
the employer.

This is a decision that Congress has made.

Now, as far as the work requirement, in this case,
it is significantly less than the work requirement that
this Court rejected in Alabama bower.

There, the question

was whether the employee was entitled to accredited service
time for the time that he spant in the military.

The credit

of service was defined in terms of full tiro.service at
40 hours per week.
Moreover, the limited exceptions in Alabama Power
applied only to employees who were on paid leave, not
employees who are in certain categories of unpaid leave? as
in this case„
v7e believe that SU£
a perquisite of seniority.

benefits should be treated as

They serve a purpose that is

akin to the most traditional seniority benefit.

And this

analysis, incidentally, was made by the Third Circuit in
the Foster decision, which was later affirmed by this
Court.
The primary purpose of CUD benefits is to protoc

XI
i
employment..

It acts as an adjunct to the nornoX layoff

protection that employees' get. when they accrue seniority
benefits.
Thus, when there is an economic downtirni, and the
employer is forced to lay off a number of employees, what
happens is, those employees that have accrued the most
amount of seniority are protected from layoff because of the
seniority that they have accrued.,

Employees v/ho'have not

accrued enough seniority to be protected from layoff, get
this more United protection of the SUB benefits; that is,
they receive some money to tide them over the period for
which they are unemployed.
And employees who have the least seniority of
all will either not beeligible at all for SUB payments, or
they will receive less because they have accrued fewer
credits.
QUESTION;

All employees laid off, 1 take it, will

receive unemployment benefits from the state?
MR.. HOROWITZ s

‘Brat’s correct.

The SUB is are

only intended to be a supplement to the unemployment
benefits provided by the State.

And the formula for

figuring out how much SUB is. to he paid includes a deducti.on
for the amount of state unemployment benefits? and in fact,
\

if an employee tor some reason does not gel state

12
unemployment benefits, for a reason that was in his control,
if he doesn't apply for .'-'her, fore example, then ir will i\ t
be eligible to receive SUB83.
We think the best analogy to SUB is hue quite
. ir benefit of severance pay that this Court
a perquisite of seniority in Accardi case.

Severance pay

also provides income that tides an employee over a. period,
of unemployment;, as do SUB5 s.
The difference, essentially,, is. -that with SUB * s,
layoff is only temporary, and severance pay deals with the:
issue of a permanent layoff.
As in Accardi, the intent of SUB8 s is to provide
compensation for the loss of the rights and expectations
that the

. a has accrued over his period of service.

It is not to provide compensation for the work that the
employee did in the past.
C-

1 vo amor nt of the SUB benef its, as the amount of
severance pay benefits, are not at nil tied to the amount of
work that was done in the past.
Moreover, the- previsions of the plan are completely
inconsistent with any notion that SUB's are to be treated
as compensation for work performed.

First of all, SUB

credits are forfeitable at any tire if the employee incurs
a break .in continuous service.

Therefore, an employee could

work for 20 years, and if he then incurred a break in service,

he would lose all the SUB o ■edit that

That’s correct.

by this Court in Alabama Power, where as well it was noted
that the pension benefits that were paid depended uj
employee -s compensation at the time that' he was—began to
receive the pension benefits s not at the time that he earned
the credits for them.
Finally, the specific point that this Court
mentioned in Foster as indicating seme sort or correlation
between the amount of work and the amount of earned credit
are absent in this ease.
Court mentioned in Foster:

There are two factors' that this

no such, provision.

Secondly, in Foster

Here there is
employees who did

not meet the minimum threshold—there, yes. had to v/orK 25
weeks per year in order tc get a vacation—-certain employees
who did not.work the 25 weeks per yenr were entitled to
pro rata vacation.
And here, there is no such pro rata requirement..
An employee who works all the way up to the two years is
not entitled to any SUB payments at all.
Now, we submit that—
QUESTION j

But the employees who wc:-! less than

32 hours pet week under Section 4 of the collective bargaining

agreement era entitled to some sort of pro rata STJBss?
MR. HOROWITZ:

An employee who works less than

32 hours is entitled to the full one-half SUB credit.
whet Section 4 of

Hoot

hi a agrean.nt does is that it defines

what's called a short-week benefit; th~

is, .if an employe a

works 24 hours in the week, he's entitled to a benefit
that he'll be paid as if he worked 32.
But—~and "the idea, 1 think, of that provision,
is probably—it was probably put in mostly at the instigation
of the union—--is to encourage the employer to make sure*—3'.
should say to penalize the employer for not allowing employees
to work 32 hours

:er week.

It acts as a disincentive to the

employer to schedule employees for less .than 32 hours per
week.
Now, as far as how it fits into the SUB plan, ar
employee who works less than 32 hours per week, does get
half an SUB credit, no matter how many hours he -works.
He may be eligible for a benefit under -Section 4 of the
plan.

Again, he's not eligible for that benefit unless

he's already got two years of service under his belt.
If he receives a benefit under Section 4, he
would still accrue one-half SUB credit for that time.

But.

because he's receiving a benefit, he would also have to give
up one SUB—excuse me, one--half SUB credit for that time.
So he would end up not accruing additional credits, if he

20

was actually receiving the benefits.
Petitioner in this case left his employment and
went to serve in the military,

Hhen he returned from

his employment, he was disadvantaged as compared to those
other employees who began employment on the same day that he
did.

Had he remained in his civilian employment, he woulc.

have had 52 SUB credits, and would have received payments
for an additional 22 weeks.
Having served in the military, he was denied these
payments,
%

We believe that this is precisely the result, that
Congress was intending to avoid when it passed the Veterans
Reemployment Rights statute.

tec'l we submit that this Court

should hold that SUB benefits are: a perquisite of seniority,
and that the petitioner was entitled to his credits.
If there are no further questions, I’d like to
reserve the remainder of my time.

OmL .ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. MIMS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT.
MR.

3SI.?¥i j

Mr, Chief «Justice,, and may it please

the Courts
I think that when one understands the supplemental
unemployment benefits plan that the Court -is considering,
one will realise that, if anything, it has exactly a reverse

21

relationship to seniority, rather than being <. perquisite
of seniority,
In the first place, the principal benefit of
seniority obviously in a layoff situation is layoff
preference*

Ant: the more seniority the employee accumulates,

the less likely it is that he will in fact be laid off;
that the layoff will reach his seniority date*
The employees—
£'JEST I ON t

Isn’t that always true of a seniority

MR. NIMS2

Pardon, Your Honor?

QUESTION:

Isn’t that always true of a seniority

MR. KIMS;

Yes.

QUESTION:

Why is this one so significant, then?

Kh. iiIMS:

That’s always true cf a seniority

plan?

%

plan.

That'S the point I’m making, Your Honor, that the

supplemental unemployment bei ofit, which is the benefit
we’re talking about here, is actually a benefit which is
most often used by people with lesser seniority then people
t

with greater seniority..

It’s more important to people with

lesser seniority than people with greater seniority.
And the point I’m making'is, rather than being
a perquisite of seniority, it indeed operates in a reverse
relationship with seniority..

QUESTION:

Mr. Nims, area't there really three

classes of seniority?

People who. were senior enough not to

be laid off; people who were in kind of a middle category
who get these benefits; and then the very, very junior
people who don't even get t sse benefits.
MR, I.JIMS:

That's true, Your Honor, but that's

true with almost any benefit.

Indeed, I believe it was

true with the vacation benefit before the Court in Foster—
that there there was a one-year requirement before you
became eligible for a vacation,.

You got entitlement to a

vacation in the second year by virtue of having worked
25 weeks in the first year.
And l don't think that that analysis would make
this benefit, or the vacation benefit in Foster, a
perquisite of seniority, or it would, make every .benefit
.a perquisite of seniority.
QUESTION;

No, but all I was suggesting was,

;

the fact that people who have ever; greater seniority get
some greater benefit doesn’t necessarily take this benefit
out of the category of benefits that are affected by the
length of service.
MR. NIMS;

No, I agree that it. doesn't necessarily

do that,
But the point being that greater senioritv,
*

once you pass the eligibility threshold so that you're

23
entitled te the benefit, greater seniority does not have
any affect on the benefit at all,

wa;

two-year man who is eligible to r eceive a payment will cat
a benefit as will the 15 -year man , if the
to reach his level of seniority,

Layoff happens

And the 15-year man will

not have any greater benefit, any advantage, over being
15-year man——
QUESTION:

Are you saying that every person who

meets the two-year requirement always gets 52 units?
KR. MIMS:

No, it depends on the work requirement,

QUESTION:

Then,

even with—among those who are

eligible, seniority has an affect on the number of units,
and therefore the number of dollars.
MR. MIMSs

No, not seniority, Your Honor? working

may, up to accumulating -the maximum of 52 credit units,
if you haven't worked in two years, and accumulated the 51
maximum credit units, yes, the fact that you haven't done
that work may result in your having a lesser number of
benefits.
But once you have

worked in two years and

accumulated 52 credit units, not only increased seniority
will not give you a greater benefit, increased work won't
give you a greater benefit.
Further,, the amount of the benefit represented
by each credit unit, also bears a reverse relationship

24
to seniority, if it bears any relationship to seniority.
The plan provides that the amount of benefit that you5II
receive in the even-?:, that yon. ever receive supplemental
unemployment benefits, is affected by

'our factors;

one, the wage rate of your job classification.

rumb

That wage

rate is established by the collective bargaining agreement
for each job classification, and has nothing to do with
seniority other than in the sense that in some jobs
preference is a factor of seniority? and your ability to
hold a particular job may be dependent on seniority.
But the actual- wage rate for than job classifiercion
will be the same whether the individual holding it is a
two-year man or a five-year man or a ten-year man or a
twenty-year man.
The second factor in the amount of the benefit
is the number of dependents that the employee has; obviously,
that has no relationship to seniority with the company >
The third factor in determining the armt.it of* the
benefit for reach credit unit is the amount of State
unemployment compensation which the employee receives from
whatever State program exists in that particular State
That has no involvement with seniority.
And. finally,- the fourth, factor that influences
the amount of benefit is the amount of money remaining
in the plan as- a whole.

The obligation of the industry is

25
to fund the. plan with a finite number of dollars agreed to
in the collective bargaining process.

Than as the plan is

exhausted through layoffs, or.oe it reaches a sufficiant
dimunition to key in that part of the formula, the aiao mt
of benefit represented by each credit unit drops.
So that you actual have the anomalous situation,
if you're focusing on seniority, that the three-year man
is much more likely to have his benefit be 100 percent
of the. possible benefit than the 20-year man, because
if ci layoff in fact gets severe enough to reach the 20-year
man, you’re likely to have the fund substantially depleted
by the previous payments made to persons of lesser senioriby,
so that the 20-year man in fact finds that he’s getting a
lesser benefit if his seniority number is in fact reached
during the layoff..
Iv j don * t believe that that ki ri of a benefit
should be classified to be a perquisite of seniority.
And indeed, the testimony in the record below is clear that
it's not thought, certainly by the industry and by the
people who negotiated it to be in any sense a perquisite
of seniority.
Rather, it is based on a formula which is go: g.u ..I
by the actual, practical realities of the steel industry
which found that prior to 1960 they actually had a SUB
plan which had a very precise relationship between how

26
many hours you worked and the acoumulation of' credit units ,
and they determined that that wasn’t nec^c ;ary.'
created an ad ministrative headache tha

It

they didnkt r... :i7

because in point of fact,, people were working at least 32
hours if they worked at all because of the existence of tb a
short.week benefit.
A short week benefit provides that if you call
an employee in during a week and have him work less than 22
hours, essentially you’re going to have to pay him for 32
hours anyway.

So naturally, you try not to call an employee

at all unless you actually have 32 hours of work for him.
So the SUB plan, and the formula for the earning
of credit units in the SUB plan, is tied to a formula
which in the industry and the practical reality is based on
at least 32 hours of work ae ieving the earning of entitle
ment to one-half credit unit.
Mow, whether or not that ever translates into a
benefit, of course, depends on whether the employes ever
gets laid off, and that admittedly is a factor of his
seniority.
But the benefit, as opposed to the layoff, is
not a factor of seniority? indeed, if it has any relation­
ship with seniority, it’s a reverse relationship.
One of the ’arguments that the government has mad
in this case is that in trying to analogize, to other

benefits which have been before the Courtf the closest.
benefit f according to the governmen
pay that was before the Court in Aocardi 5

wel.'1 , reap-- nder

believe that that analogy is faulty.
Severance pay is, normally, and was in Aoeardi,
very much a factor of seniority.

Somebody who had worked

for that particular railroad 19 years—and the 20-yearpeople were not subject to the discharge', but it was people
with less than 20-year seniority—somebody who had worker
for the railroad for 19 years was entitled to a larger
amount of severance pay than someone who had worked for
18 years, and 17 years, and 16 years.? in fact, down the
line.

And. that, we submit, was key to this Court8s analysis

of severance pay being a long-term bene Tit which really the
notion, of compensated service before the Court in the
Accard! case really measuring only time on the rolls as
an employee.
Bat the SUB benefit is very different.

The 15--yea

man has no advantage whatsoever over the 2-year man, so long
as each have accumulated the maximum, number of credit units
available of 52.

And indeed, as we‘ve shown, it might

happen to work out. that the 15-year man is at a disadvantage
because of the dimunition of the money in the fund, should
a layoff reach his level of seniority.
So we don't feel that the -SUB benefits can

20

.be an logized properly or fairly to a raverance,

possibly
benefit.

s
The government has argue'1 this morning that in a

sense the steel industry is acting in an inconsistent
fashion in treating the two-year continuous service
requirement as seniority and crediting the veteran for
that,, but not crediting him with the time in the military
for purposes of accruing credit units.
We don’t feel that’s

.inconsistent at all.

In the first place, the applicable bargaining agreements
and plans expressly provide for both of those situations.
They expressly provide that service in the military will
not break continuous service in the company? and they
expressly provide that there will ba no accrual of credit
units for the individual during the time he is in the
military.

3c thev*re certainly consistent with the under­

lying contractual documents.
But more important, they’re consistent with what
the industry regards the law being? as interpreted by
/■

this Court and other courts throughout the last several
years.

Continuous service, as that is defined in the

pension program, has indeed notions of seniority, notions
of simply being on the rolls as an employee.

And the

industry recognizes that, and does not break continuous
service for penaim purposes, for SUB

purposes, or any

purposes,
Whan the veteran leaves the civilian einoicw
and then comes back within the permitted. statutory
period, that’s no different than the situation that wap
in front of this Court in the Foster v. Dravo case ir
which this Court considered vacation entitlement.

And

this Court pointed out in a footnote that while you have io
work in the required number of weeks in order to earn
vacation eligibility for any particular year, if in fact a
five-year man has two weeks vacation and a ten-year nan
has three weeks5 vacation and a twenty-year man has four
weeks5 vacation, in that sense under the plan in front
of the Court in Dravo, the defendant there, the company
there, did credit time and service for purposes of
determining the maximum amount of vacation eligibility ,•
which an individual employee would have.

And the Court

noted that in its footnote.
But that doesn’t mean that earning that four
weeks’ vacation that you may have the potential entitle­
ment to is also a factor of seniority.
that it was not.

The Court found that it was conditioned

upon a bona fide work requirement.
notion

The Court found

That the traditional

of a vacation Is a short-term reward for work

actually rendered.'
And that wasn’t changed by the fact that also

it's traditional that the amount of

.vacation you can earn

a reward for is a factor of your total service over a larg
number of years.

And therefore, a 20-year man may eye

four weeksf vacation, where a 15-year man gets three? that
didn't change the actual earning of vacation in any
particular year as being keyed to a bona fide work require
meat, as being reasonably keyed to such a requirement.
That didn't change the traditional notion of vacation in
this Court's'eyes.
We think that the same is true with the SUB
plan.

There is a minimum vesting perio- of two years.

Bui it also should be understood that that period relates
only to the actual entitlement to payment of a benefit.
It does not relate to the earning of the credit unit.
So that the first week in which the individual
employee works, he accumulates one-half credit unit.

He

merely has a two-year eligibility requirement before he
can receive z benefit in the event of layoff.

But that's

no different than with lots of other benefits which don't
kick in until an employee has had some minimum period of fc
with the company.

That’s true in many companies of

hospitalizatior benefits, of sick pay, of many other
kinds of benefits which I think the Court would readily
agree that if the focus is on the real nature of the
benefit, those benefits are thought to be short-term

31
compensation benefits rather than perquisites of seniority.
But -they still may have an eligibility requirement that you
be with the company one or two years before the company
starts to fund those benefits for you.
And we don’t think that that changes every benefi
that may exist into a perquisite of seniority.

We don’t

think the Court found that in the Foster v» Pravo decision,
So in summing-.up, unless the Court has other
questions,, we think that the District Court in this case
wrote two very detailed opinions.

And he wrote tic first

opinion before he had the benefit, of this Court’ s guidance
in Alabama Power, in which he analyzed why the industry
had the work requirement it had? why it had the formula it
had? how the benefit was applied? and as he .interpreted the
Court’s decision up to that point in time, he wrote-a,

we

believe, very detailed opinion as to why the SUB benefit
was not a perquisite of seniorityr and why the plan should
be administered according to its terms.
Following this Court’s decision in Alabama Power,
he wrote another detailed opinion focusing precisely on the
real nature of the benefit, and concluding, based on the
record made in front of him* that the real nature of the
benefit was short* term compensation whi b substitute for
wages in areas where wages had traditionally bean paid.
We believe those two decisions correctly interprr

32

the plan and' the law.

We believe the affirmance .by the

Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was proper.
We would say one thing.

There is - of course, a

conflict between the courts in this case, and the United
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which also
had the steel industry plan in -front of it in its decision
in Hoffman v. Bethlehem Steel.

But that decision—and

Your Honors, 1 am sura, will read it carefully-—was
rendered in 1973 prior to either the opinion of this Court,
in Fester v. Pravo or the opinion of this Court in Alabama
Power v. Davis.
And the focus of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals
in Hoffman was that since it was theoretically possible to
earn a one-half credit unit with as little as one hour’s
work in a week, the Third Circuit felt that the same bizarre
result which this Court had mentioned in Accardi was
possible; that this Court has indicated in its decision
in Foster v. Pravo, and its decision in Alabama Power v.
Davis, that that bizarre result, theoretical though it may
be, is not the appropriate analysis.
QUESTION'S

That is highly theoretical, isn’t it<

MR. NIMS;

It's very, theoretical, particularly

in this case in which there's been testimony as to the
industry's need under its own agreements to bring an
individual in for 32 hours if it brings him in for one

hour during the week.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Horowitz:?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOE.

ITE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, HOROWIT2:

I do have a couple of points I

would like to make, Mr. Chief Justice.
First, in regard to the comment abort the bizarre
results, as Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed out, that is merely
a theoretical analysis.

And I am sure it was theoretical

in Aecardi as well.
The Court there was just using the bizarre results
to indicate that the plan in no way attempted to compensate
for the amount of work performed.
The same is true here.

There is absolutely

nothing in this plan that indicates that SUB benefits are
intended to be compensation.

Respondent has noted the

four factors that go into determining the amount of the
weekly payment, that is made.

Not one of those factors

has anything to do with compensation fox* work.
The only work requirement that is involved in
this case is the fact that most of the employees who
earn these benefits work.

There is not x requiret;.ant

that all employees work, as I discussed in Setting out

the pisa.

There are several categories of employees who are

not working who am also receive benefits.
ho/, essentially, the only difference between the
work requirement here and tha work requirement in any case
where there is just a period of service that is required
to accrue benefits, for example, in the most standard seniority
situation, is that respondent has seen fit to exclude
certain categories of employees who are on leat;s of absence
from receiving these SOB benefits.
How cur contention is that these rights are
guaranteed by Congress..

And the fact that respondent

chooses to exclude certain employees who are on leaves of
absence does not mean that veterans can be excluded from
these benefits.
I'd also like to discuss the point about whether
this is a seniority benefit, simply because employees who
have 20 years of service and employees who have 15 years of
service will receive the save benefit.
HOW ;

1 s clear that zee the lower levels of the

seniority ladder, there is a seniority distinction made
based upon length of service .

Employees who hh1© more service

are eligible for the benefits? employees whe have less
than two years are not.

Employees who have more .service

may get up to the 52 credit maximum.
QUESTION s

How long does it take to accumulate

35
the 52?

Two years?
MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION;

It take.3 two years * yes.

So that once you've worked two years.r

and accumulated the 52 credits, from then on length of
service doesn't count? or how much you work doesn’t count?
MR. HOF.OWITZs

That's correct.

That's corr •: ::t •

Your Honor
QUESTIONs
no difference.

So any time from two years on, there;&

But up to that time—

MR. HOROWITZ:
difference,

Up until that time,- there is a

had we submit that the fact"—

QUESTIONs

And that's -the advantage that's being

claimed here?
MR. HOROWITZ:

That’s right.

It’s of no significance

to petitioner that everyone—whether everyone above him had
52 units, or whether

some of them had 52 and some of then

had 200 and some of them had 300.
QUESTION:

But nobody can have more than 52?

MR. HOROWITZs

That's right.

Nobody can have

mere than 52.,
QUESTIONs

Bo nobody could have 200 to 300.

MR. HOROWITZ:

No.

But. it wouldn't hmake an;

differen.se in fchiu case if someone could have 200 or 3 jV .
QUESTION s

But you can have less?

MR. HOROWITZ:

Yes, you can have less.

And

petitioner had less.
QUESTION:

And he should have had more.
and petitioner says he was given

lessf and he was entitled to the 52.
MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION t
totally ineligible.

That's correct.

An employee for the first two years
He doesn't acquire any SUB's.

MR. HOROWITZ:

He acquires credit, but they're

not goad for anything.
QUESTIONS

But then, or. the first day of. his

third year, if he's worked at least 32 hours every week
in the first two years, does he immediately get 52?
MR, HOROWITZ:

Well, no, he gets one-half per

0

week.

So after a. year, lie has 26.

Question:

Yes.

MR. HOROWITZ;
26.

He has them written i.n a ledger;

But the;r*re not good for anything.

If he's laid off

he can’t collect, any payments.
QUESTION:

But my question was after—on the

first day of the third years* MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

Rig.it, he wou!

then have 52. •

-—he's worked at least 32 hours a

week—
MR, EOR2WITZ:
QUESTE©? s

That’s correct.

'“-for each of the previous two years

does he immediately have 52 SUB’s?

37
MR. HOROWITZs

That's right, h e would have--he

would have accrued 52 by then, yes.
QUESTION;

Mr. Horowitz, other than the inter-

rupted service because of military duty, could a man get—
satisfy the two-year requirement without a1so accumu1ating
the 52 units?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Yes, if he was on some leave of

absence for two years that—
QUESTIONs

Any other leave of absence, ha could

still be accumulating his two years without earning any
credit?
MR. HOROWITZs

That's right.

And if he was on

layoff status as well, he would be accumulating his two
years' of credit.
And I'd just like to briefly alludo to the
Foster decision which respondent has cited.

In Foster,

as this Court explained in Alabama Power, the Court
relied on the fact that vacation benefits are understood
to be directly related to work? that they are a respite
for work performed ? and that there, the Court did not
find that there was any reason tc diverge from that
understanding.
But here, where there's clearly a seniority
9(jr 'CO

this benefit, .as we5ve just discussed, the

question than is whether the benefit is to be characterize

se­

as short-term compensation for work performed,

fuel we

submit that there is no evidence—
QUESTIONs

So you say in two respects there:s a

seniority—one just, for the two-year eligibility.
MR. HOROWITZs
QUESTION;

And for the number of credits.

And also the work credits.

MR, HOROWITZ;

The number of credits .earned, rir/1.

whether by work or by sows other*—
QUESTIONs

And you say, if he hadn’t been away,

he'd have bean working, and that would--would rot only hove
been satisfying his two year eligibility requirement, but
also accumulating credit.
MR. HOROWITZ;

That!s correct.

Ills stipulated

that had he remained in the employment * he would have 52
credits.
If there are no further questions, thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11;40 o'clock, a.ni. , the case
in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
