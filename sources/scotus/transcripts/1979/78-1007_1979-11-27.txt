PROCEEDINGS

MU. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Fullilove v. Juanita Kraps, the Secretary
of Commerce.
Mr. Benisch, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT G. BENISCH* ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONERS
MR, BENISCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a case of first impression and, indeed,
of national importance.

We are called upon today for the first

time to deal with the question of the constitutionality of a
mandatory racial quota imposed by Congress in a public vzorks
funding Act.

This is not a case dealing with employment

discrimination ox- discrimination on the part of unions in
the construction industry.
The question is whether or not Congress can enact
an outright racial quota and, if so, under what circumstances*
The Act we are concerned with is the Local Public Works
Employment Act where under (2) $4 billion was appropriated
fox~ local public works funding throughout the country in
order to assist what was at the time a flagging construction
industry.

Just prior to the passage of this appropriations

bill Representative Mitchell proposed an amendment to the

4

bill which provided in substance that any grantee receiving
funds other than the Act must assure the Secretary that at
least 10 percent of those monies would be set aside and
appropriated solely for the use of minority business
enterprises as defined in the Act.
QUESTION:

Mr. Beaisch, does it make any difference

in your argument whether Congress was acting under its
authority to tax and spend or whether it was acting under
its authority to enforce the 14th Amendment?
MS* BENISCH:

I think, Your Honor, in looking at

the legislative history and record here it makes a great deal
of difference to observe what Congress was about when it
passed the Local Public Works Employment Act.

In other words,

it was not dealing in the area of civil rights legislation
such as it might have been doing when it passed 'the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
QUESTION:

Did Congress in this particular Act

make any findings as to discrimination in the employment
area?

I
MRo BENISCH:

I submit, Your Honor, non© whatsoeverJP

and that is the first prong to my argument, that indeed an
examination of the legislative record and history discloses
that there was absolutely no finding made whatsoever in the
record or even in the discussions, of found discrimination
on the part of the non-minority business community it the

5

construction industry.
Mow, it is — 2 think it is critical to

note at

the outset here that in its recent decision this Court in
Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney held
that a. racial classification regardless of purported motivation
is presumptively invalid and can be upheld only upon a showing
of extraordinary justification.
X submit that- with^that presumption of invalidityin mind it is therefore incumbent on the Government in this
action to rebut that presumption because we are dealing purely
and simply with a racial classification required across the
board and mandatory.
How, we submit here that neither the Government
nor the courts below have cited any authority which rebuts
the presumption and validity of that racial classification.
For purposes of my argument here today, petitioners
will concede that if the racial classification or the amendment
to the Act were to pass what has become known as the strict
scrutiny test, it might be held that the presumption is
rebutted.
Now, the strict scrutiny test has two prongs, as
we know.

The first is there must be a compelling governmental

interest behind the passage of the Act or the legislation in
questionj and, secondly, the means -used or the mechanism
must foe the least intrusive or onerous available.

6

Now, as to the compelling Government
QUESTION:

Why can't Congress just spend the money

it raises by taxation in the manner it deems best?
MR, BENISCH:

Your Honor, the spending power, the

cases have held that Congress cannot spend the taxpayers'
money which is collected on a nondiscriminatory basis.
can't spend it in a discriminatory manner.

Congress

But without getting

cute about it, if you will, I am simply saying that whatever
Congress does with respect to monies or any passage, it must
do in s constitutional manner.
QUESTION;

No one doubts that.

But do you think

that Congress is under the same strictures when it simply
grants money as it is when it regulates private industry in
a constitutional sense?
MR„ BENISCH:

I most certainly do-

In other words,

I don't think that the subject matter of the legislation
affects in any way the constitutionality of the Act being
passed.

In other words, whether Congress is acting under its

spending powers, whether it is acting under its civil rights
powers, or whatever, whatever it does must be done in — pursuant
to the Constitution.

That is, it cannot violate the Fifth

Amendment and it cannot -- it must act in accordance with the
strictures and prescriptions of the Constitution.
We submrt that in this cage Congress

there is

no indication that Congress has acted in accordance with the

7

Constitution? and, in fact., we believe that it has violated
1
Article .5.of that Constitution.
QUESTION:

When you speak of Congress' civil

rights powers,under what provision of the Constitution do you

/
classify that?
MR,o BENISCH:

Well, there would be the 13th

Amendment, Your Honor, and those amendments that have become
known as the Civil War Amendments.
QUESTION:

When Congress appropriates money for

aid to South Korea, for example, under what clause of the
Constitution do they -- does it act?
MR, BENJ,SCB:■

When it appropriates money for South

Korea?
QUESTION:

For aid to South Korea.

MRo BENISCH:

Well, it is under its spending powers.

And I believe that what we are faced with here is their having
been er drafted on a funding bill, an 11th hour after thought;
and when we look at the legislative record we have the sponsor's
statement as follows:

We spend a great deal of Federal money

under the SBA program creating, strengthening and stpporting
minority businesses.

Yet, when it comes down to giving those

minority businesses a piece of the action the Federal Govern­
ment is sorely remiss.
I

Now, the purpose of the amendment as proposed by
Mr. Mitchell was to give the minority business community a

8

share of the action.
Now, Congress sat down, it was appropriating
$400 million, and it said, $400 million for minority business
enterprises is not going to hurt anybody and we ought to giire
them a piece of the action.
QUESTION:

Let me go back to the aid to Korea

again for a moment, to a hypothetical problem.
You said that is under the tax and spending power.
There ere also foreign policy considerations and national
defense considerations.

It is an amalgam of a number of

considerations, is it not?
MR» BENISCH: That would be true.
.

QUESTION :

Is that not true in this area?

MR a BENISCH:
"racial classifications."

Your Honor, the key word here is
In other words, we have an amalgam

hera, or perhaps an amalgam.

But one of the ingredients or

one of the facets of this act. that we are dealing with today
.is the imposition of a mandatory racial classification quota.
ii

.

Now, th't fact alone puts this case in a completely unique
position to my knowledge to date.

I have not -- I ss not

aware of any prior Act of Congress which engendered a mandatory
racial classification across the board.

It is not a good

faith effort, it is mandatory.
And 1 think, Your Honor, that is the key lis tinctio,a
in this case.

- 9
The decisions of the court below indicate that.
Congress perhaps could have taken note of historical,
discrimination in the construction industry in the contest
of chi's passing this Act and therefore pass what it considered
to be a remedial statuteQUESTION:

What is a "take note of the historical

discrimination in the construction industry”?
MR. BEMISCH:

The courts below indicated that;

yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, do

MR.* BENISCH:

you think that there was?

MRo BENISCH:

QUESTION:

No, I said in another -- you suggest

that in this Act they would have to specifically take note of
those fact3 and say that this is the reason we ar*e passing
this Act.

That is so. Your Honor.

QUESTION:

That if they had done that you would

suggest that at least the first leg of the strict scrutiny
test would be satisfied?
MR* BENISCH:

No, I wouldn't in this regard, if

I may answer that.
I believe that under this Court's decision in Bakke
that there must be, where you have a racial classification,
there must be some findings

made findings mads by the

legislative body in order to support the legislation in
question.

That is the hracial classification.

And I am

referring specifically to the following language of Justice
Powell' s opinion^

We. have never approved a classification

that aids persons .perceived as members of relatively victim­
ized groups at the expense of other innocent individuals in
the absence of judicial, legislative or administrative findings
of constitutional or statutory violations.

11

After such findings have been made, the governmental
interest in preferring members of the injured group at th©
expense of others is substantial, since the legal rights of
the victims must be vindicated.

In such a case the extent of

the injury and the consequent remedy will have been judicialiy,
legislatively or administratively defined.
Also, the remedial action usually remains subject
to continuing oversight to insure that it will work the least
possible harm to other innocent persons competing fcr the
benefit,
Without such findings of constitutional cr
statutory violations, it cannot be said that the Government
has any greater interest in helping one individual than in'
refraining from harming another.

Thus, the Government has

no compelling justification for inflicting such harm.
QUESTION:

I didn't persuade anyone to agree with

me.

MR. BENISCH:

I do.

Act?
QUESTION:

No.

At what stage

the judicial findings could not be made at the time of passage
of the Act, of course, could they?
MR® BENISCH:

I have no challenge of that, yes.

But the legislative findings are what we are dealing with.

But the language you read froi

Justice Powell's opinion referred to legislative or judicial
findings, did. it not?

I am just --

upon the body that was acting, it was in accordance with

QUESTION:

I am suggesting a judicial finding

could fa made then only in the context of a judicial proceeding
such as a school desegregation case where the proceeding is
initiated in the judicial branch.
MR® BENISCH:

I am submitting that where there is

a challenge mounted to the particular activity or action passed
by Congress, for example, that a judicial finding could be
made"? and that is what we are asking for here.

If a finding

be made that Congress has made — has in fact made no findings
sufficient to support the racial classification Involved in

13

Ye s , s i j: .
i

QUESTION:

Is it your view that you would expect

the Congress the sort of detailed findings that one normally
expects a court or an administrative body to make?
MR> BENISCH:

Ho, 1 don’t believe Congress would

have to make the detailed findings, for example, such as
findings of fact might require on a trial.

Congress can

paint i’ith a broad brush.
But I submit it cannot, tar an entiere industry
with art even broader brush in order to pass a racial, classifi­
cation.

Abd that is what it has done here.

It has tarred

the entire construction industry with the reputation
attributed to Title 7 actions which, for the most pert, dealt
with, union die crimination against workers.
dealing with businesses against businesses.

We are here
And there has

been n< finding whatsoever of discrimination in that area.
QUESTION:

Mr. Benisch, what sort of findings would

justify this statute; would they have to found that the
Government was guilty ©:f discrimination against minority
business enterprises or that there was private discrimination?
What are the kinds of fxndixigg that you think would have
saved the statute, in your view?
MRo BENISCH:

I believe, Your Honor, that a finding

for example — take it at the basic level — a finding that

14

there had been a perceived pattern and practice of discrimina­
tion on the part of non-minority businesses in the construction
industry to exclude from participation non-minority -- minority
businesses.
QUESTIONi

Do you really think the statute would

be valid if there were $uch a finding?
MRe BENISCH:

If there were would be, Your Honor,

because we are not saying

I am not arguing here today that

Congress has no power perhaps to enact remedial legislation
or that racial quotas are per se invalid.
QUESTION:

What if fc'here had been a finding that
f

there had been previous discrimination against Presbyterians,
could Congress say that at least xo percent of this money
must how go to Presbyterians?

What is your answer to Mr. Justice

Stewart's question?

I am very sorry, I have misplaced -

I have -QUESTION:

As I understood your answer to Brother

Stevens, you. said that this legislation "would be valid if there
were certain findings.

And sny question just indicated rather

some amazement at your answer.
MRe BENISCH:

;

Yes.

In other words, if Congress had made -- had
conducted hearings and had made a determination that indeed
there %as this pattern and practice of discrimination on the
entrepreneurial level, I submit that it might foe

it might

rebut the presumption.
QUESTION:

Against Presbyterians?

MR» BENISCH:
QUESTION:

In this case I am speaking of?

Yes.

MR» BENISCH:

If it was Presbytefia[ns, if it --

if Presbyterians were viewed by Congress to be a minority
which was entitled to protection, yes.

If you want to

substitute Presbyterians from minority business enterprises,
I see nothing wrong with it.
QUESTION;

You don't think the religion clauses are

IS
any problem?
!-.Uw BEH-tSCE;

hell t the fact there is a separation

between church and state would be a consideration.

But I

believe that the fact you are Presbyterian doesn't mean
that you are not entitled to equal protection.

And if you

have been discriminated against I think you are entitled to
some remedial legislation.

You can't have it both ways.

It raises no

constitutional question, there is no constitutional question.
You don't need any findings or anything.

If it does raise a

constitutional question, why can’t you remedy the past
constitutional error by correcting it in the future?
Mil., BENISCH.:

Your Honor, my point was that the

initial funding f6r the Republicans in your example would not

have been proper; it would have been a mis-use of the spending
powers.

Right.

HE. BSEISCH:

The remedy therefore to make up and

help the Democrats will simply be compounding the wrong.

just equalizing things.

In this case, yes, the cure is,
with a situation in this case where

Constitution on the entrepreneurial level in the construction

It simply is a piece of the action for the minority

business enterprises.

That is what it is.

of this money around.

That is not sufficient to support

a racial quota* in my opinion.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J» HICKEY, ESQ. ,
l

OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MRa HICKEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
As my co-petitioner counsel mentioned at the start
of his argument, this case is of historical importance, it is
of practical importance, and it does not come to this Court
without antecedents.
Only 25 years ago this Court in the Dunn decision,
Brown y. Board of Education, condemning a theory of separate
i

but equal.

Today we are asked to say that quotas are good,

What are quotas?
?

Essentially it is a form of sufferatism.

You are carving out a people, a group, and saying that they
v

need special treatment, or should receive special treatment.
QUESTION:

We do that with students in schools

who cannot speak English, do we not?
MR. HICKEY;

1

agree, Your Honor, that that has

been done to remedy certain problems.

But ws start with the

theory -- and I think that is where we all must start -- the

20

theory is that separatism based on race is bad, unless there
is a corapetling reason for some remedy.

an interesting case because 65 years ago a statute was passed

employees, 80 percent of their employees had to be native

Twenty percent could be anything.
A resident alien suit, this Court struck it down

on the grounds that it denied that individual a fundamental
right to engage in business.
How, what we;, have done here is reverse the quota.

Why are

Why are Orientals

The Government in this case two years ago in

Bakke came to this Court and said there is no discrimination
against Orientals.

In the very brief they filed in this

case, the appendix gives all the statistics regarding Whites,
Hispanics, and doesn’t show any discrimination against
Orientals, the picking and choosing and no explanation.
But go further, they use terms like "Spanish
speaking."

They are not saying Hispanics.

Spanish speaking.

They are saying

Even the Government in other contexts have

dropped that word because, even though I didn’t do vary well
t

in school in languages,

I could be Spanish speaking.

And

the Government dropped it in other contexts because of that.
It was used for that purpose.

Even if you took a term like

"Hispanic," there is no explanation as to who is Hispanic.
The Government in other contexts have said Portugese from
Portugal are not Hispanics, but Portugese from Brasil

sip.

We have all of these questions, but no answers.
I am not saying there can't be answers, but when you get down
to a. question like Indians, this Court in previous terms has
considered who is and who is hot an Indian, different kinds
of Indians, tribal Indians, Indians living off and on
reservations at different times,

Despite the stereotype you

see on television, if you sea an Indian walking down the street

22

ia Washington without any tribal head dress, you. could not
segregate .him out from the populous.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose an Indian from India

would have -MR, HICKEY:

And that s.tso, the statute does not

evey say what Indians they are talking about.
There is also a little interesting thing that
there is a set-aside of 2-1/2 percent for work done on tribal
lands.

Is that 2-1/2 percent 'above the 10 percent, is it

2-1/2 part of the 10 percent?
I raise these questions to show that this was a
hastily drawn statute, extremely hastily drawn.

Basic

definitions were left out, groups were included without any
reason, groups were excluded without any reason at all.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that we hold the

statutes unconstitutional .because they are badly drawn?
MR„ HICKEY:

I think

I would love to answer as

a practicing attorney, but I am too realistic to believe other­
wise.
I think when you talk about creating a statute in
an area like race, I think it is incumbent upon the legislature
to take the added time to draw a carefully drawn statute so
everyone knows what they : * -are talking about.

MR, HICKEY:

That is when it was first

enacted..

There are various levels of a construction job, as one

24

part of a job is completed another job takes its place and
the jobs are still going on.

These are massive projects.

They are still going on throughout the country.
The thing here i3 this:
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that the failure to

identify the Indians as American Indians, if that is what
Congress meant, or the inclusion of Orientals as to whom
no prejudice may perhaps be shown nor discrimiftatior, is a
fatal flaw in the whole legislation?
MBu HICKEY:

In this legislation it is.

When you

are talking about some legislative findings in drafting a
statute

when you add in an area classification based on

race, let us assume everything else is obey about it, which
we disagree. I think at a minimum you have to explain to the
people who are going to be subject to that statute who is in
fact covered by it.

I think that is a minimum.

and it is not in here.

I think --

There .is no definitions of any of thes

terms.
But going back to another item, the question was
raised as to the fact that whether there was a sort of
general discussion, general findings of discrimination in
the construction industry, absent the legislative history in
this particular Act.

And the answer is, "Ho."

They talk

about discrimination, voting, employment, there is nowhere
any finding under any other Act, of discrimination i.i the

25

constriction industry.
How., if there were that, just remember who xve are
talking about.

We are not talking about the general contractor

He is the one' at the bottom getting the work.

tion hes to be by the Federal Government and the State

In Katsenbach v. Morgan, certainly

Oh, I think that the reverse is

the Court has sustained action

legislation on the basis of findings made by them.

That isn't

what we have today.
QUESTION:

Would a finding that general contractors!

who obtained Government contracts have traditionally discriminate»
against subcontractors been sufficient to support the statute?

27

MRo HICKEY:

I would say not, because discrimination

is not at that level, discrimination is on the Federal Govern­
ment and the State level government.
But, again, there was no findings in this
litigation -QUESTION:

the State that at least 10 percent of the money delivered to

MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Days.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DREW So DAYS, III, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
MR* DAYS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

if plea.se

the Court:
The petitioners have conceded that if the MVS
provision at issue here was enacted by Congress to remedy
past discrimination and if it was properly tailored to
achieve that objective, then-this Court has to determine as
did the two courts below that this statute is not in contra­
vention. 'of the Constitution or Federal statute.

29

QUESTION:

Well, then, I think you are correct

that your brothers did concede that.

But of course that

doesn't bind us, does it?
MRo DAYS:

Ttfell, no, it doesn't, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

To decide this case, even if they

conceded their whole case away.
MRo DAYS:

Well, I simply want to call the

Court's attention to what matters are at issue between us.
I think that as a threshold observation, as this
Court has indicated in some of its questioning, we are talking
cot about a State legislature, we axe not talking about a
city council, we are talking about the Congress of the
United States, that as this Court has recognised has special
has special competence to make findings with respect to the
effects of identified past discrimination and to taka
appropriate remedial measures.
QUESTION:

What authority do you rely on for that,

General Days?
MR0 DAYS:

Well, there are several provisions of

the Constitution, it seems to me, that the Congress can rely
QUESTION:

I thought you said there were cases

in this Court that had noted that.
MRc DAYS:

well, the Bakke decision I think goes

into some discussion of the role of the Congress with respect
to addressing discrimination.

30

QUESTION:

la which opinion?

MR„ DAYS:

Justice Powell’s opinion, I think goes

into that in most detail but of course South Carolina v.
Y&faenfeach -QUESTION:

The one distinctive feature of his

opinion was that no one single one of these colleagues -MR. DAYS:

Well, nevertheless, I think that some

of the things he said in his opinion deserve to be considered
by litigants before this Court and by the Justices of the
Court.

I think there can be no contravention that Congress

does have this unique authority.

We have seen it in South

Carolina v. Katzenbach, and a host of other decisions with
respect to voting, employment, housing.

I think that it is

beyond cavil that there is that competence.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that if a State had

made similar findings under its police power and enacted
exactly the same law, it would have stood on a region
footing in the congressional enactment?
HHo DAYS:

Yes, I think so.

I wouldn’t say that

it would thereby be inferring, because it was enacted by
a State legislature.

But I think we have to recognize the

unique competence of the United States Congress to .address
these issues.
QUESTION:

Do you distinguish the Congress from

the legislature of the States where for the most part the

31

States do not make findings; is that not true?
MR0 DAYS:
Chief Justice.

I as not an expert in that regard, Mr.

But I think

that as a matter of fact most

State legislatures have very short terms, they act in summary
fashion with respect to legislation, and legislative records
t

are not made in the traditional sense.
QUESTION:

But the functions are precisely the same,

are they not?
MRo BAYS:

Yes, they are.

QUESTION:

We have not let the absence of findings

by a State legislature impede sustaining the State': acts,
have we?
MR, DAYS:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and

I think that is because this Court has recognized that
l

legislatures5 functions are different from court and
administrative bodies.

They are representative democracy

at its best; they are responding to the experiences of the
members of the legislature, hearings that they may have had
held, their conversations with their constituents, and bringing
all of that information to bear over time v?ith respect to
problems that are of concern to that particular State or
locality.
Now, that is the same process that the United
States Congress follows.

The fact that we have committees

making records, holding hearings, making certain findings from

32

time to time, it seems to me does not get to the core of the
constitutional power of Congress to act without those types
of findings and without the detail that I think that Petitioners
assert is required under these circumstances.
QUESTION:

Let's assume for a moment that this

section of the statute had dealt only with Orientals and no
findings of any kind were made.

Would you still view that the

statute was valid?
MR0 DAYS:

Yes, I would, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

What would be the basis for assuming,

as ray statement would require

that you do, that Orientals

have been discriminated against in the United States -- all
Orientals.
MR. DAYS:

Well -~

QUESTION:

Anywhere in Asia I suppose would be

included by the term.
MRo DAYS:

Well, let me tnake a preliminary

point, Mr. Justice Powell, and that is that Mr. Hickey is
wrong in saying that there were no definitions of the minorities
included in the provision, 131, of the appendix-

l'n guidelines

that were issued by the Economic Development Administration,
there were definitions of minorities that were included under
this provision.
QUESTION:

Was it authorised to make those

definitions by the Act?

33

MUo DAYS:

The Act did not explicitly authorize

Economic Development Administration to make the definitions
but the definitions have drawn from determinations that have
been u'sed in the Government at least since 1971 with respect
to these groups.

In other words, the groups included in the

Act, the groups that had been mentioned in a number of
actions by administrative agencies, and I think recognized
by the Congress.
But to get back to your question, Mr. Justice
Powell, on Asian-Americens I would direct the Court's
attention to the brief of the Asian-Araerican Legal Defense
Fund because I think it goes into more detail than did our
brief with respect to the history of discrimination against
Asian-Americans in the country.

Certainly Congress ias

dealt with discrimination against Asian-Americans in the
Voting lights Act, most recently in 1975.
QUESTION:

I think my question assumed as a fact

that Congress had not legislated as it has for example in
title VII and the Voting Rights Act with respect say to
other minority citizens.

Let's assume you had a clean slate.

Congress decided all of a sudden it was going to do something
for the Osrientals, but made no findings.
MRt DAYS:

I would have to rely upon the competence

of the Congress —
QUESTION:

Yes.

34

MRo DAYS:

-- to make those determinations.

It

would not be required to go into detail.
QUESTION:

So your basic position is that it is

unnecessary to have anything in the Congressional Record that
would support a discriminatory statute enacted by the
Congress.
MRo DAYS:

Yes, that is our position; but I don't

think wd need to be pushed to that ultimate -s/
\

i

QUESTION:

Well, I agree with that.

I am just

seeing how far you would go.
QUESTION:

Mr. Days, Suppose the Government's

statute were infirm,because of the inclusion of Orientals
there is no record.

Suppose that is hypothetically the

conclusion of a court --

, ■

MRo DAYS:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

-- that it cannot judicially notice the

fact' of discrimination against Orientals or Aleuts or Indians;
because they haven't specified American Indians, would that
necessarily mean that the entire statute would fall?
MR-o DAYS:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

But let me say something, because I

this line

of questioning I find very disturbing with respect to AsianAmericans.

I feel that perhaps in our brief we did not give

the type of attention to the history of discrimination against
Asian-Americans that was deserved.

I think that there is

35

more than ample evidence in our history in the decisions of
this Court to justify this Court concluding that Congress
was acting intelligently and constitutionally in including
Asian -Americans within the ambit of this particular statute.
And I want this record of the United States position before
this Court to reflect that.
QUESTION:

Well, what if Congress had said

included among the other people to whom the set-aside was to
foe benefited, Norwegian Americans.

And one could only

conclude that its action was totally irrational as opposed
to your statement that it was acting rationally in the
Oriental American, because Norwegian American contractors were
very successful and they probably had gotten more than their
share of that business.
Would that make this statute different in
constitutional terms?
MR„ DAYS:

If Norwegians were involved?

QUESTION:

American citizens of Norwegian

MR o DAYS:

Yes.

ancestry.

Well, I think that it would perhaps create more
difficulty but I don’t think as a constitutional matter it
would be; distinguishable.

In other words, when we are talking

about racial classifications we are not urging upon this
Court that the Court should close its ayes to the extent to

35

which certain types of classifications have been used
invidiously in this country.
QUESTION:
classification.

But you are not talking just about racial

Spanish-speaking is not a racial --

MF.o DAYS:

Well, when I use the term "racial,” I

am also referring to certain types of ethnic identifications
that have been used in this country for purposes of invidious
discrimination.
QUESTION:

More fundamentally, General Day, would

this case by different if the statute had said that at least
S5 percent of this money had to be spent for -- on business
enterprises that were owned and operated by white people?
MS. DAYS:

If Congress made that determination.

Again, I think that an action of the Congress would come to
this Court with a special character.
QUESTION:

So if the statute had so provided you

think the constitutional question would be indistinguishable
from the one now before us?
MRo DAYS:

I think that in terms of the competence

of Congress to make these determinations it would not be any
differant.

I think in terms of the role of Congress with

respect to the Civil War Amendments one would have to ask
whether in providing this type of benefit to non-minorities
Congress was acting in the consistent pattern of the last 20
years or so.

37

QUESTION:

I suppose, in effect, that is what this

— that is pretty close to what this statute does p-rovide.
It provides that 90 percent -MR. DAYS:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

But if the wording were that way, do

you think the question

the constitutional question would be

the same?

hypothetical .,'case?
MS, DAYS:

I' think the competence of Congress to

act under the 13th and. 14th Amendments has to be placed in
the proper context.
QUESTION:
States.,

The 14th amendment binds only the

.j
MR, DAYS:

Well, it binds the States but Congress

has the authority under: Section 5 to not only deal with
discrimination by the States but also to prevent discrimina­
tion it. the future by the State.

38

QUESTION:

Perpetuating the 14th Amendment.

MR0 DAYS:

That is right -

QUESTION:

Have we aver upheld a case where Congress

enacted a statute pursuant to the enforcement powers granted
under the 14th Amendment where there weren’t congressional
findings?
MR» DAYS:

Well* I think that if one looks at

Oregon v. Mitchell and also the Katzenbach v. Morgan case
that you mentioned, it depends on one means by "findings."
QUESTION:

Weren’t there findings or declarations

that the Congress finds such and such

maybe boiler plate,

but nonetheless findings?
MRo DAYS:

Well, precisely, Your Honor, think

that the Congress makes determinations from time to time and
it has to be viewed a3 a continuing institution.

In Oregon

v. Mitchell I don't believe that there were specific findings
that there had been discrimination against minorities in
areas ether than the South'.

In other words, no full record

made.
But I think what this Court said was Congress
could, based upon what it already knew about discrimination
flowing from the use of literacy tests, could conclude that
banning literacy tests could ultimately serve the purposes
that the 14th Amendment was designed to reach.
QUESTION:

Getting back to the question about the

39

statute, it gave -- 85 percent of the business would go to
white contractors.

Isn't it significant that Congress never
\

had to pass such a bill?
MRo DAYS:
Marshall.

I think it is significant, Mr. Justice

It supports the wisdom of the framers of the 13th

and 14th Amendments and the 15th Amendment, the Civil War
Amendments that, given the history of our country, it would
not be likely that the majority would have to come to its own
defense, that those statutes were designed to
QUESTION:

Such a statute would be valid., a

statute that in words placed a requirement that 85 percent
of the business go to whites?

That is a quite different

statute, even though practically it may work out the same.
If you say that the blacks shall be eligible for only 15
percent of the business, you would support that statute, I
don't think you have considered your answer very carefully.
MR 0 DAYS:

Well —

QUESTION:

Would you say that statute would be

const!autional?
MRo DAYS:
"No. 41

No, I think my answer -- the answer is

But what I was trying to point —
QUESTION:

question.

Well, it wasn't just debating a

It seems to me quite a fundamental question in

this case.
MRa DAYS:

Well, ay answer was in two parts.

40

QUESTION:

It was "Yes” and now it is "No."

MR. DAYS:

No, I don’t think thcit is what I have

said, Mr. Justice Stewart.

What I said was when we are talking
«

about the competence of Congress to make certain determinations.
The fact that there are not full findings on the record with
respect to a certain tjrpe of discrimination and the need to
remedy that presumptively invalid.

But when we are looking

at the authority of the Congress to act and we are looking at
the 13th and 14th Amendments, we are looking at the 5th
Amendment and the duty of Congress to insure that Federal
funds are not used in a way that either creates or perpetuates
discrimination, wherever it happens to occur in this country.
Then it seems to me a statute that has to do with providing
and insuring that 85 percent of the benefits go to the whites
would raise some serious constitutional questions.
QUESTION:

Don’t you think this case does?

MR, DAYS:

I do not.

QUESTION:

I know which side of the questions

you are- on, but ■—
MRo BAYS:

Well, it raises serious --

QUESTION:

These questions are not frivolous.

MR* DAYS:

It raises serious constitutional questions

and I assume that is why the case is before this Court.

But

I think that when we are talking about Congress desiring to
benefit minority contractors by providing 10 percent of a

41
$4 billion program, when we are talking a Federal contract
program that involves over $100 billion and we are talking
about one program that lasts for a year ■—
QUESTION:

I read all that material in your brief,

General. Days and I didn't know if you are talking — if this
kind of a de minimis argument or an argument that your brothers
on the other side lack standing, or what is it?
MRo DAYS:

No, the argument is simply with respect

to the nature of the remedy.

This Court I think has expressed

the view that when racial classification
QUESTION:
you knew.

You can't be just a little bit pregnant,

If it is wrong, it is wrong.
MR. DAYS:

Wall, I think it is simply --- I think

it is an equitable question that in looking at what Congress
has dons it is not irrelevant that it has limited the thrust
and sccpe of this program, as it did.

I don't think the

constitutionality of the statute stands or falls on that -QUESTION:

Precisely the same case, that a separate

statute that said $200 million shall be appropriated and be
spent entirely for minority business enterprises.

And the

reason we are doing it is we want to remedy past discrimination
and we want to have more minority participation in the economy
in the future.

They said it in words.

Why would that be a

differant case?
MR o DAYS:

We11, it won1dnE t be

cl

different

42

QUESTION:

So the fact that it is 3.0 percent is

really irrelevant, isn’t it?
MRa DAYS:

I don't think it is irrelevant, I

don’t think it is dispositive.
QUESTION:

I took your treatment in the briefs

Mr. Days, to be that Congress, among other broad powers, has
the right to experiment with certain types of remedial
legis.lt.tion.
MR, DAYS;

Wall, that is correct; and I think what

this record reflects is that Congress has over at least the
past ten years experimented with different approaches .to try
to improve the conditions
QUESTION:

Do you think Congress has the power to

experiment by saying that 50 percent of this $400 billion or
$200 billion shall go to Methodist subcontractors?
MRo DAYS:

Well, I think that again one has to

look at the situation in context.

Clearly, if there has been

a hisfccry of systematic discrimination against Methodists,
jfchen Congress has the right to experiment to determine how
i

to gat at that particular issue.

It is a 14th, Amendment

violation if States have been discriminating.

It would be

a 5th Amendment violation if the Congress nsed funds in a way
that supported the continuation of that discrimination.
■\.

But, that is not the case we are talking about,

Mr. Justice Relinquish.

QUESTION:

43
Weil, I had a feeling that you are

kind of saying that maybe at an extreme this ease would be
bad bat, since it is only IQ percent and it is a fairly small
amount of the total proportion, Congress can kind of experiment
and tailor the thing.
MR.' DAYS:

\

Not at alii

My position is that were

Congress to decide to extend this for 5 years or 10 years
based upon the history of discrimination against blacks, that
too would be constitutional.
QUESTION:

What if it ware to decide that it tfas a

HR. DAYS;

Well, X think, that while this Court

has not addressed itself specifically to that issue, if one
looks at Santa Fe Railroad case and the fact that whites were
deemed to have been protected by 1981» one might argue that
other croups that could show a history of discrimination
in this country might benefit under the 13th Amendment.

I

am not prepared to make that argument today.

Are you thinking about slavery of Orientals in

MR. DAYS:

Congress to reach discrimination against blacks.
QUESTION:

You have the 5th and the 14th.

I just

wondered why you refer to the 13th.
MS. DAYS:

Well, I think that as the amicus brief

that was filed by a minority contracting organization, goes
into that in some detail, as does the brief of the Legal
Defease Fund.

I think there is ample evidence to support this

extension.

Would you leave that argument to that?

that the 13th Amendment does apply, Section 2 -QUESTION:

No, no.

,

there was testimony of discrimination against minorities

that tiie money had not been distributed adequately with
respect to minorities, '[there were claims of discrimination
againspi minority contractors.

And on the floor of the House

and tilt Senate, the debates I think reflect this understanding
by Congress, that there was not only evidence in the record
of this particular legislation but evidence with respect to
other attempts by the Congress to deal with the disadvantaged

position of minority business enterprises.
The approach that Congress took to achieve this
end — that is the 10-percent set-aside -- was appropriately
tailored, in our estimation.

One has to remember that this

bill was designed to pump large amounts of money into the
econon]' very quickly.

Applications had to be approved in 60

days and the projects had to be under way in 90 days.
■Congress therefore had to adopt measures that would be
appropriate under these circumstances.
We think that the 10-percent set-aside was reasonable
in light of the 17 percent population of minority groups in
this countrythe fact that we are talking about one program
extending for one year.

And despite what the Petitioners say,

there is no evidence that there was any intent to stigmatize
BOB-mirority contractors and non-rainorifcy persons by the
legislation.
QUESTION:

Would the constitutional question be

different if the set-aside had been 25 percent, which is stated
in the minority?
MS. DAYS:

It would not have been different.

Again -QUESTION:

I think you indicated it wouldn't be

different if it were 100 percent.
MRo DAYS:

That is right.

QUESTION:

I agree

That is right.

47
MRo DAYS:

I think that as we argue in our brief

the extent to which there might be other alternatives utilised
by Congress in this situation, they had been tried by the
Congress.

There was the Small Business Administration Act,

there «3re legislative attempts to deal with minority invest­
ment, there, was an attempt to sieal with bonding for minority
businesses.

And what Congress concluded

and 1 think this

is reflected in the debates on the minority- business enterprise
legislation -- that those have simply not worked; despite
everything Congress had attempted to do, minority businesses
still remained a very small minority of those involved in the
construction business and were getting less than one percent
of the Federal contract dollar.
insofar as the Petitioners have argued that the
minority business enterprise provision violates title VI, I
think what we have here is legislation that

in the same

document dealt with discrimination based upon sex.

In other

words, Congress was thinking in title VI terms at the same
time that' it enacted the minority business enterprise
provision.
We think that these two provisions, that is the
minority business enterprise provision and title VI, can
operate in tandsy., and there is no antagonism between those
particular pieces of legislation.
QUESTION:

Could women cpiae in and say that the

an area where Congress is not required to deal with the entire
problem at one time.

It can deal with what it regards is the

most egregious problems at first and then move toward address­
ing other problems as it gains more experience with resolving
the other problems.

I don’t think that there is any require­

ment that Congress deal with the entire problem at the same
time.
QUESTION:

Could it have simply dealt with Oriental

contractors and not with black
MR» DAYS:

os Spanish-speaking contractors?

I believe it could have.

When one looks at the minority business enterprise
provision, what one sees is the culmination of years of concern
by the Congress with the unique plight of minority business
enterprises.

if we look at the general background, what we

see is a Congress that for 20 years has been trying to deal
with various forms of discrimination based upon raco or ethnic
origin.

What we see is a Congress that has attempted one

49

approach and where it has found that that approach has not
achieved the objective that was desired, seeking other
approaches.
And the voting rights area X think is a perfect
example, starting with the 1S57 Voting Rights Act and moving
up to the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and then amending that Act
in 1975.

We see that in the Employment Discrimination

legislation in 1964 dealing with private discrimination in
employaantj and then in 1972, dealing with discrimination by
State and local government and by the Federal Government.
This search has also been true with respect to minority
business enterprises, starting with more general good faith
requirements and then moving to this particular provision that
constitutes a minority set-aside or a 10-parcent division.
QUESTION:

If we put to one side just for the

moment the justification as remedy for past discrimination,
do you think the. set-aside could be justified on the theory

v

ii

that Congress might have thought it good for the economy and
the cora unity as a whole to have greater minority participation
in the construction industry» entirely apart from past
discrimination?
MRo DAYS:

I think that Congress could do that.

1 don't think we have to make -QUESTION;
MRo DAYS:

You haven't made that argument.
We haven't made that argument, because

50

X don’t think it is necessary.
QUESTION:

That would justify the statute even

though your opponent describes it as a "piece of the action'’
theory.
MR» DAYS:

Nell» Mr. Justice Stevens, it is really

very difficult to write on a clean slate when we are talking

.c*l

about minority business enterprises in this country.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't know much about discrimination

against --/we have talked about other groups:

Aleuts, for

example, and you know there are some that there may not have
been a history, there may just have been a failure to participate.

And I an asking you whether you think the Congress could
'i'-*.'-

■*>..<.

.

.

-

•

address the problem of the "failure to participate even if there
is nothing invidious about the history.
HE, DAYS:

I think so.

Under the; 5th Amendment I

think Congress has a very broad authority to insure that Federal
t

funds are not used in a discriminatory manner or somehow
supports discrimination that is out in the world.

QUESTION*

So on® of the problems about resting

entirely on past discrimination is that the beneficiaries of
the legislation may well foe people quite different fro’a those
who have suffered the most through history.
MRo DAYS:

I think that is correct, and that is why

I am perfectly comfortable making the argument that you suggest.,
that the power of the Congress goes beyond remedying specific

51

identifiable discrimination.
But that is not this case.

We think that this case

can stand very fully on evidence of past discrimination and it
may not be necessary for this Court to reach that particular
consideration in the contest of this record in this case.
QUESTION:

Do you think there has been past invidious:

discrimination against the Aleuts?
MRo DAYS;

Well, Your Honor, I could not expatiate

for a vary long time on that particular issue.

But I think that

for people who are familiar with the Alaskan area and the
Aleutian Islands area, and certainly there are Representatives
in the Congress from that area and there have been considerations
by other Government agencies in the Executive branch, that is
a reasonable conclusion.

I see nothing in the record or anywhere

else that would rebut the assumption there was discrimination
against those —
QUESTION:

It is basically up to Congress, then,

who is going to be included?
M'R-o DAYS:

That is 'right.

It is its unique competence

to make these5 types of broad determinations beyond what accord
or administrative body ~QUESTION:

It svalutes the past invidious discrimination

or failure to. get a piece of the action?
HR, DAYS:
Thank you.

Yes.
