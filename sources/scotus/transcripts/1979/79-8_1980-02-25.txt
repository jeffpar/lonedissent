Mr0 Levander, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. LEVANDER s ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEVANDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may It please the Court:
This case is hers on the government’s petition
to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit.

At issue is the construction and

the constitutionality of the Federal Magistrates Act.
The respondent, who has previously been convicted
of numerous crimes, was indicted in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on
one count of unlawful receiving a firearm.

Prior to trial,

the respondent moves to suppress various statements;?"he had
made to the Chicago police at the time of his arrest ’and
also to federal agents on two subsequent occasions.
/■

:■

rf'

"The
|

respondent claimed that these statements were Inadmissible
as a matter of both Fourth and Fifth Amendment law.
In accordance with section 636(b)(1)(B) of the
Federal Magistrates Act, the District Court designated a
I

■■

■ I

/magistrate to conduct and evidentiary hearing regarding

respondentfs pretrial suppression motion.

Following an ex-

tensive hearing, the magistrate made proposed findings of
fact, rejecting respondent's claim.

In particular, the

magistrate found that the testimony of the federal agents
was more credible than that of respondent and he recom­
mended that the motion be denied*
The District Court thereafter, pursuant to section
636(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Magistrates Act, made a r}cie novo
determination® of respondents motion.

That is, the

District Court mad© a thorough review of the transcript of
the hearing held before the magistrate, the magistrate's
report and the submissions of the parties, end he thereafter
denied the motion.to suppress evidence.

Subsequently, the

respondent was convicted based on the evidence at the
suppression hearing and some stipulated facts.
On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals reversed.
The court first acknowledged that the proceedings ..in the
District Court had complied with the Federal Magistrates
Act*

The court further found that the Federal Magistrates

Act did not violate Article 3 of the Constitution.'

none­

theless , the court concluded that the due process clause
of the Constitution requires the District Court either to
defer to the magistrate’s proposed findings of fact or to
rehear the testimony itself.

And since the statute pro­

hibits the deference that the court felt that the due process

5
clause requires, the Court of Appeals seat the case back to
the District Court for a second duplicative suppression
hearing to be conducted personally by the District Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Levender* what if after the denial

of the suppression motion but at the point at the trial of
the case* where the government sought to introduce the
confession* the defendant had objected and said under
Jackson v. Darmo, an opinionof this Court* I am entitled
to the judge’s determination as to whether it is voluntary
or nog before it goes to the jury?
MR._ .LEYAMDER:
as 1 understand it.

Well* it wasn't a formal trial,

The trial was based on the stipula­

tions anbtthe transcript.

about a defendant who really did have a defense and had an
argument tc make, not only his confession was Involuntary

but he had witnesses to put on and an alibi and that sort
of thing, do you think that the District Judge would have
been required under those circumstances, when the con­
fession was offered at trial, to conduct a hearing and
listen in person to the suppression motion?

QUESTION:

So the only function of the hearing

in the federal system is to make sure that the jury is

QUESTIOH:

And they can reject It?

MR» LEYANDER:

That’s right.

In Jackson v. Beano,

of courses the Gourt held that the jury that determines
guilt or innocence is not permitted to make that initial
determination.
QUESTION:

But you say that somehow a magistrate

is more impartial and mors neutral than a Jury in making
that sort of determination.

:

Jackson v. hermo says you can't submit a confession to them
without —
MR.. LEYANDER:

I think you can.

In a footnote In

Jackson v. Denno and also in Lego v. Twomey, the Court
reiterated that you could, give it to a Jury, it just can't
be the same jury that decides guilt or- innocence.

In other

words, you could have a suppression hearing at which a jury

8
was empaneled and listen to the- evidence and made a deter­
mination of voluntariness»

Thereafter at trial you would

have to have another Jury decide the question of guilt or
innocence.

The Court made quite clear in both Jackson v.

Denno and in Footnote 9S I believe it is, of Lego v.
Twomey that it has Just got to be & neutral fact-finders
that is the trial Judge, another judge or another jury.
It just can*t be the jury that tries guilt or innocence.
QUESTION:

Which presumably is not a neutral fact­

finder?
MR. LEWDER:

Well, the theory I think In

Jackson v* Derma is that the jury will be misled, as to the
question of voluntariness because it will look to reliability„
And since the question of voluntariness does not involve the
question of reliability but rather involves solely the
question of the policeman’s behavior or the constable’s
conduct, the Court said that due process requires that a
neutral fact-finder that is not concerned with guilt or
innocence make the determination.
In this Court, the respondent makes essentially
three claims —
QUESTION:

Before you go on, ie there anything

final about the magistrate’s recommendatIon?
MR, LEVANDER;

It Is not final.

It is not de­

terminative and he has no power to make a determination.

9
The statute divides pretrial matters into two kinds of cate­
gories c

As to most pretrial matters» which I will call

procedural for want of a matter nomenclature» or subsection
(a) matterss the magistrate Is authorised to whear and deter­
mine the matterand as to that the District Court makes a
review as if It were » court of appeals.

Thetis, it can

reverse for errors of law and for findings of fact which are
clearly erroneous.
However, as to subsection (b) or ease dispositive
motions as are sometimes referred to» which include prisoner
petitioners» motions to suppress evidence in a criminal
case, prisoner petitions regarding the conditions of con­
finement, as to those kinds of more important motions,
Congress established a. different standard of,review» that
•*

is the magistrate only makes a proposed finding of fact
and recommendations of law and it is the District Court
which actually must make the decision, and he does not have
to give a clearly erroneous deference to the fact-finding
or —
QUESTION:

The judge in those — in those kinds

of cases, the district judge has mere than two choices»
MR.. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

He can hold a hearing himself.

MR, LEVANDER:
that.

That’s correct.

He could.

He is empowered to do

He is also empowered to send it back to th® magistrate

10
for further hearings* to recommit the matter.
QUESTIOH:

Or he can accept it „

MR» LEVANDER:

Accept* reject or modify in whole

or In part*
QUESTION:
he thinks

Well* he can hold a hearing himself if

if someone convinces him that he really ought

to hear the witnesses himself —
MR* LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

— he can hear them.

MR. LEVANDER:

That’s right.

But the Court of

Appeals in this ease for good reason concluded that there
was no abuse of discretion in net holding such a hearing.
QUESTION :

We realize that in some cases'- a; "motion

to suppress is a determination of guilt or innocence.
MR. LEVANDER:

Well* it may, as Mr. Justice'

Rehnquist pointed out a few moments ago* fee determinative
of the trial.

But In Lego v. Twomey, this Court made quite

:

■a. voluntariness hearing has nothing whatsoever to do with
guilt or innocence.

And as has been repeated by this Court

on many occasions* and a question — we don’t desiegrate the
importance of suppression hearings in terms of effectuating
constitutional rights —
QUESTION:

Do yon know how many narcotics cases

go to trial after the denial of a motion to suppress?

11
MR. LEVANDER:

Well* I suspect that there are a

fair number of guilty pleas if the defendant loses —
QUESTION:

A fair number, about 80 or 90.

MR. LEVANDER:

I don’t know specifically at this

point *
Our position and a critical question on the
statutory matter is what is a "de novo determination*”
position is quite clear*

Cur

A de novo determination is a

thorough review of the evidence induced before the magis­
trate, the magistrate’s report and submissions of the
parties*
The respondent’s position is not quite so olear*
They say that de novo determination means what we say It
means some of the time, but other times it means a de novo
hearing, and they distinguish and they say that it means
that a de novo hearing any time that the credibility of the
•witness is called into question, in other words any time
there is a conflict in testimony.

But of course In a sup­

pression hearing, and certainly habeas proceedings and all
of those kinds of proceedings, virtually every pretrial
hearing is going to involve conflicting testimony, so
therefore respondent's real position 1 take it is that in
most cases two hearings will be required*
QUESTION:

Well, even if there isn’t conflicting

testimony, in a sense questions of credibility are almost

12
always at issue, aren’t they, to the extent that a judge or
a magistrate has the right to ignore unocntradictad testi­
mony?

MR. LBVANDER:

That’s true»

Although respondent

hasn’t addressed that el&iia as to whether or not they
would think, you might ask them whether or not a second
hearing would toe required.
At the outset„ it is quite apparent in our view
that the act, that respondent *s construction of the act
would utterly defeat Congress’ purpose»

Congress enacted

the Magistrates Act to relieve the District Courts from
the tremendous burden In litigation.
fairly overwhelming.

The statistics are

And in particular. Congress said in

1976, when it amended the act, iff© want magistrates to
conduct these kinds of evidentiary hearings»

To require

two hearings in every case would just obviously defeat
what Congress sought to do, to relieve the District Courts
of pretrial matters so that they could conduct trials and
make decisions»
QUESTION:

I suppose it wouldn’t really be in

every case, although it would toe most cases because 1
suppose the parties could stipulate that they would accept
the determination of the magistrate.
MR. LSVANDER:
right.

They could consent to it, that's

I don’t think the respondent could contest it,

13
but the respondent here of course did not consent.
QUESTION;

Right 0

MR. LEVAHDER;

The language in the legislative

history of the act squarely refute respondent*s elate.

The

aefc does not say the District Court Is required to make a
de novo hear?.ng of the evidence.

It says It must make a

de novo determination of the magistrate’s report.

This

distinction In language makes it clear. It seem® to us ,
that there is not a de novo hearing requirement.

It is

simply# on contrast to subsection (a) motions, a kind of
review pattern.

It is not the clearly erroneous pattern.

It Is a de novo determination pattern.
Moreover, the act itself empowers the District
judge to conduct a second hearing.

Now, if that grant of

power be wholly unnecessary, if de novo determination
meant <1® novo hearing, the power would already be there.
Obviously Congress thought it meant something else,
Finally, where Congress thought it important In
the body of the act to require the District Court to make
a second hearing or to reheat the testimonys it expressly
provided.

636(d) talks about contempt proceedings.

When

contempt occurs before a magistrate. Congress specifically
stated that the District Court must hear the testimony.
Here, however, he only must make a de novo determination,
something quite different.

QUESTION:

Isn't there a special reason for that*

for perhaps he would include among the witnesses ©n the
contempt matter the testimony of the magistrate himself
or herself?
MR- LBVANDER:
Justice.

That Is exactly right» Mr. Chief

The legislative history I think answers any

questl-ons on this point.
The original version of the 1976 amendment pro­
vided that the District Court would have to rehear the
testimony.

Congress rejected this language and said instead,

of hear tie novo» they put in de novo determination, and
the legislative history makes clear that that language comae
from a Ninth Circuit decision called Campbell v. United
States District Courts which is quoted at length and with
approval in the House report accompanying the 197*5 amend­
ment.
In Campbell,

the Court of Appeals concluded

that a District Court could designate a magistrate to con­
duct a suppression hearing and that thereafter the District
Court make a d© novo determination of the motion, which did
not mean that it had to rehear the testimony.

And the

report itself, the House report itself states that, and I
roughly quote, ,suse of the words de novo determination is
not intended to require the district judge to conduct a new
hearing on contested Issues ,** squarely and flatly refuting

15
the pe spondent

construction of the act..

QUESTION:

Well, what if this case had gone to

trial not on the testimony of the suppression motion but
just after the motions made a regular trial on guilt or
innocence and a question was raised, as to the admissibility
of a point of evidence which required a determination by
the judge as to whether the evidence was admissible* do
you. think it would have been permissible for him to say,
well* you present this testimony to.a magistrate?
MR. LEVANDER:

Well* that would not be a pretrial

motion —
QUESTION:

No0

i

MR. LEVANDER:

— and the act speaks about pre-

trial motions, so therefore I don't think it would to
statutory power to do that c
QUESTION:

I think that ~~

Do you think it would be constitutional?

MR. LEVANDER:

Yes, although it would be a very

unusual circumstance for a district judge to do that, because
it would, certainly delay the process and it would be hard,
for me to imagine a

hypothetical where a district judge

would really want to do that*

Normally questions of admis­

sibility can be determined quite readily during the course
of trial, and a district judge ?jould have no reason to.
But where he knows that he can set up his schedule and
designate magistrates to conduct certain pretrial motions,

16
then he would be inclined to do so.
QUESTION:

You are not suggesting that in a Jury

trial a judge could stop the trial, and refer something to
a magistrate after the trial has commenced?
MR. LEVANDER:

No, under the statute he would

have no power to do that.
QUESTION:

The statute doesn’t permit him to do

it.
MRo LEVANDER:

ThatTe right.

I think Mr. Justice

Rehnquist was asking me whether hypothetically the statute
provided that, would it be constitutional* and I didn’t
see any problem.
«

The respondent defends the *—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

AFTERNOON 3BS5IOH — It00 0»CLOCK P.M.
MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Levander» you may

continue®
MR® LEVANDER:

Thank you* Mi*. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:
The Court of Appeals concluded and the respondent
agrees that the due process clause requires either that the
district judge defer to the magistrate's proposed findings
of fact or to rehear the testimony» but this analysis
doesn't make any sense in the facts, of this ease.
Here th© District Court adopted the magistrate's
findings®

If the District Court had merely deferred to

the magistrate's findings®

If the District Court had

merely deferred to the magistrate's findings» it would
have again denied the motion®

That it made a more thorough

review and did not defer could not possibly have deprived
the respondent of any kind of procedural protections.

In

fact» he received more protection because he got a more
thorough review.
We also believe that the Court of Appeals
analysis is flawed in falling to consider the three facts
that this Court has set forth which should be considered
In determining what process is due in a particular circum­
stance.

That is the personal Interest Involved» the risk

of erroneous deprivation of that Interest

and the

18
government’s administrative and financial interests in ad­
hering to the procedure set forthc
QUESTION:

Counsel * supposing the magistrate had

decided the other way and on review* that Is had held that
the statement should be suppressed, and on review at the
instance of the governments without taking any additional
evidence „ the court had overruled that determination,
would you say it still would be just a «—• there would fee no
purpose to having — then would you say the standard
didn7t make any difference?
MR. LEVANDER:

No, the standard would certainly

be different because he would fee able to review and over­
turn him, that is the District Court would be able to
overturn the magistrate even though the findings of fact
were not ’’clearly erroneous.*7

He would be able to over­

turn —
QUESTION:

He could do it without taking any

additional evidence?
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

That * s righto

Now —

But you said the defendant really

doesn't get hurt by the Court of Appeals position but he
might be hurt if it had gone the other way for the magis­
trate, Is what I am saying.
MR. LEVANDER:

But I think in thi3 criminal case

the respondent canrfc raise the deprivation that might occur

19
to others.

Here Ik this ease, h® had a fall and fair hear­

ing before the magistrate»

The magistrate mad© proposed

findings of fact against him.

Those findings have ample

support in the record and the District Court, upon making
a thorough review of that record, fch® magistrate®3 report
and the submissions of the parties concluded that the
motion should b© denied,

The case would be a more difficult

on® perhaps where it was purely a swearing contest between
a defendant and a —
QUESTION:

But your view ©f the procedure ~ now

you are saying he doesn’t have standing to make this argu­
ment, and I have to think that through — but your view of
the procedure is that even if it is a swearing contest be­
tween the officer and the defendant, the district judge may
nevertheless in its so-called de novo review reverse the
finding of the magistrate without hearing any additional
evidence.
MR. LEVANDER:
question.

That is a much more difficult

When it Is purely a swearing contest — and the

evidence Is equally balanced —
QUESTION:

Well, as a matter of statutory con­

struction, you say that that is what Congress intended.
MR» LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

That5s right.

Haven’t we hinted if we have not held
4

that credibility findings are rarely if ever to be reviewed

20
on a cold record?
ML LEVANDER;
QUESTION:

You have tc —

Or to reverse them, on the hypothetical

that Justice Stevens has just posed»

Is it not ona thing to

affirm credibility findings on a cold record and quits
another to reverse them on a cold record?
MR. LEVANDER:

Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice, and

that is why we say in our brief that the District Court
could reverse the magistrate's proposed findings in a case
like thi3 one, for example,, where there are objective
factors in the record to support the magistrate, what the
magistrate actually concluded.

But let's assume that the

magistrate concluded that he believed respondent, well,
there are various objective factors in this record which
make respondent's testimony fairly incredible at points,
from which upon reading from the cold record you can tell
that the respondent

he admitted that he lied on November

19th, his August 8th —* he claims he made no statement on
August 8th, yet that statement that is attributed to him by
the Chicago police and appears in the arrest report is the
same statement that he admits having made on January 12th.
And it is just inherently incredible that the Chicago police
made up a statement which respondent admits that he subse­
quently made in January following his arrest.
So in this kind of a case, where there are

21
objective factors aside from the just a pure swearing con­
test „ the District Court in making its de novo determination
could reverse the magistrate.

Obviously, the District Court

is on shaky ground in those circumstances where it is purely
a swearing contest and he simply reverses tlue magistrate,
and that is a much more —
QUESTION;

He believes that the trier of facts

disbelieve, is that the kind of a case you are posing?
MIS. LEVANDER:

Well, that would be difficult to

V do, but here w® don't have that problem, of course, because
he adopted the magistratef@ findings.

findings that he believed the defendant and disbelieved
the officers and therefore reeojamended the suppression of

Now, the District Judge reading the record

and nothing more reverses the district judge on the credi­
bility finding^ do you mean that would give rise to due
process questions?
MR» LEVANDER:

Yes* although that would be similar

to what happens in agency proceedings.

The same kind of

relationship that exists between the magistrate and the
- District Court exists in agency proceedingsa in the" British
special master situation, in special masters in original
cases in this Court, and normally the reviewing court or
the court that has the power to enter the judgment does not

normally would give them credit for what they are worth
based on his independent review of the record. . And when

something again undor Universal Camera Corp., this. Court’s
decision in Universal Camera Gorp., that the reviewing
court can take into account as to whether there is substan­
tial evidence in the record or whether the District Court's
determination is erroneous.
QUESTION:

But don't- you take into account the

difference betxfeen findings of fact generally and findings
of fact based entirely on credibility of the speaker?

23
MR» LEVANDER:

That is absolutely correct.

And

where, of course, the only issue is credibility, the

„

District Court

if you wanted to reverse th® magistrate and

the only issue was credibility and the evidence was equi­
poised between the defendant and the police officer, then
the District Court cannot simply ignora the magistrate's
determination of credibility.

magistrate In that circumstance, he would probably have to
rehear the testimony or recommit it back to the magistrate
for further findings»

MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Well —

It just that they are affirming in­

MR» LEVANDER:

But that is a big difference

because here an impartial neutral Article 3 adjunct has
evaluated, the credibility and made specific findings about
that credibility and the District Court has credited those
findings based on his independent review of the record, so
therefore, Just like an —
QUESTION:

What if he says on the review, well,

I really can’t tell because you’ve got a swearing contest
here, but even though the statute directs me to give a de
novo hearings there is really no way to do it but I will
just assume they are probably right.

Could he have done

that?
MR. LEVANDER:

Yes, and then he would be giving

the magistrate’s report that credibility which it is due»
He would say I trust the magistrate, the magistrate has

This is a de novo determination of the magis­

That is what the statute says, and the

legislative history makes quite clear that Congress did not
intend the District Courts t© rehear testimony on contested
Issuesc

That statement appears over and over again in the

i

legislative history.
QUESTION:

Then why do they use the words de novo?

MR. LEVANDER:

Tc contrast it to subsection (a)

in which the magistrate hears and determines actions and the
District Court must give deference on a clearly erroneous
star.lard to the magistrate's findings.
;

The Court of Appeals in our view simply misevalu­
ated the three factors underlying the due process analysis.
In Lego v0 Tworaey, this Coux’fc made clear that a suppression

! hearing does not implicate the important issue of guilt or
i-: "
innocence, it is simply a matter of the conduct of. the
police that is in question and the question is whether or
not evidence which is wholly probative and relevant shall
be kept out because of the conduct of the police.
Second, the Court of Appeals viewed this to be a

this same kind of proceeding has been used in England for
many years, it is used in all of the administrative agencies,
and it is used

by this Court in Its original jurisdiction

And finally:, the Court of Appeals did not at all
address the government*s substantial interests in using
magistrates»

There is a terrible problem of congested

litigation and magistrates in a recent article appearing
in 16 Harvard Journal of Legislation, it has been shown
that a study shows that th® use of magistrates has in­
creased by & third the ability of District Courts to dispose
of cases.

In 1979* over 3*000 evidentiary hearings were

conducted by magistrates under section 636(b)(1)(B), a con­
siderable saving of time»

And these things were not

addressed by the Court of Appeals at all»

I might.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOAN B. OOTTSCHALL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. OOTTSCHALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As the government stated this morning, the
Magistrates Act not only withholds from the magistrate
decision-making power with respect to case dispositive
motions, but it expressly provides that if any party objects
to any finding or any recommendation of the magistrate **a

2?
judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of
those portions of the report or specifyed proposed findings
to which objection is made,”
QUESTION:

Laying aside for a moment what differ­

ences if any there may be between de ncvo determination and
a de novo hearing, would you — do you think there Is a
difference between a district judge affirming a magistrate' s
finding on credibility and reversing a finding on credibility?
MS. GOTTSCHALL:

I do not.

I think that' the

question is whether the district judge is in a position to
make tin independent determinati on „
i;

>r
■\

If all the district

■ "

•

,

judge does is looks at what the magistrate has done and
says, well, this is a credibility finding, I obviously
don’t have the evidence before me tc reevaluate that., I
don*t see how that can possibly be explained as any kind
of a de novo determination of anything, and I think that
is the difference between what the Court of Appeals felt
and the position that the government ie urging now.
QUESTION:

What do you think is the difference

between a de novo determination and a de novo hearing?
MS. GOTTSCHALL:

I don’t believe there is any

difference, and I think that the prior decisions of this
Court established that very clearly.
First of all, let me just point out that this act
does not use the word hearing the way the government

28
suggests* that is an evidentiary hearing.

This act speaks

of hearing motions for summary judgment and motions to dis­
miss complaints and all kinds of things that ^re not evi­
dentiary, And this Courts in the case of United States v.
First City National Bank* had virtually an identical argu­
ment before it* where a party claimed that because a statute
spoke of de novo review rather than trial de novo that
there was to be more limited judicial review, and the Court
rejected that.

It said that the critical concept is de

novo and what de novo means is that there has to be an in­
dependent determination of the issues.

And I would just

suggest that in many decisions of this Court, virtually
all the decisions of this Court talk about de novo, all of
those terms are used interchangeably.

I think this is

quite clearly a distinction without a difference.

And I think that the suggestion that the statute

is rendered useless because in cases where credibility was
critical or some other source of evidence that wasn’t in­
cluded in the record required rehearing, I don’t think that
is true.

I would expect that there area great many matters

where if there is an Initial hearing before a Judicial
magistrate, there can be a stipulated record developed, a
question of law can surface, and many different things can
happen that will avoid the necessity of having to rehear
the evidence.
I would suggest that a real swearing contest such
as occurred in this case is really rather unusual.
not in confession cases -— the Court has noted the

Perhaps

30
confession cases typically involve this kind of thing9 but
in all the great variety of matters that are cove red by
section 636(b)(1)(B), I would expect that credibility would
not be the critical issue in that many canes.

ferent question —
QUESTION:

I’m not sure it makes a difference,

but I think your statement of the fact is not based on
not consistent with my observations.
MS. GOTTSCHALL:

There is a different kind of

in the generality of eases.

In general, there would be one

pi'obably police officers testifying as to perhaps articul­
able facts that they observed that they contend amounted to

31
probable cause —QUESTION:

The evidence was in plain sight and

the defendant says no, it was not in plain sight, it was in
his back pocket, and that sort of thing.

Isn't that

typical of the type of evidence you have?
MS, GOTTSCHALL:

Well, I don't knew exactly how

many or what percentage cf Fourth Amendment suppression
■motions would raise this kind of credibility question.

It

may be that suppression motions do raise credibility ques­
tions in the majority of cases»
QUESTION:

You might well argue that If In fact

they are overwhelmingly credibility contests, that is the
reason for an Article 3 judge to hear them»
MS. GOTTSCHALL:

I would think that is right

because in that situation the independence of a decision­
maker is critically Important»

I would point out that I

think the legislative history ia very clear that credibility
findings end findings of fact in which credibility figured
were very clearly covered by the cte novo review provision.
There is really no question on the basis of this legisla­
tive history that Congress contemplated that credibility
issues would be redetermined just like any other issues,
that any finding of fact of the magistrate would be subject
to this de novo review provision,
QUESTION:

Well, I would have reached almost the

32
opposite conclusion from .hearing the government's argument
that the statutory language probably is in your favor„ but
that the legislative history is against you.
MS. OOTTSCHALL:
Mr. Justice Rehnquist®

I think there are two questions*

The first question is the standard

of review when a finding is objected to, and I don't believe
that there is any conflict between the parti®» in this case
that the judge is supposed fco make ©n independent determin­
ation of the issue,»

The government states in its brief that

the judge would to® violating the statute if h® deferred to
the magistrate on fact-findings.

So I think on that point

there is agreement.
tf

The problem arises on the question of what pro­
cedures the judge has to follow in evaluating the magistrate's
recommendations„

And what the legislative history says, it

is true that the statement that the government has quoted
consistently in its brief, the use of the words de novo
determination is not intended to require the judge to
actually conduct a new hearing on contested issues* that
is true»

But the government consistently omits the two

explanatory sentences which follow* which state that
normally the judge upon application would consider the
record which has been developed before the magistrate and
make his own determination on the basis of that record.
But in some specific instances, however, it may be

33
necessary for the judge to modify or reject the findings
of the magistrate, take additional evidence, to recall wit­
nesses ox* to recommit the matter to the magistrate for
further proceedings *
There is no question that Congress contemplated
that rehearing would be necessary in some cases.

And from

the eases that Congress cited —

MS* GOTTSCHALL:
QUESTION:
of the

Well, the government seems to —

I asked specifically if that was one

options that was open to the judge, and the

government said yes, that occasionally h® would have a
hearing himself.
MS. GOTTSCHALL:

The government suggests though

a completely unreviewable standard of discretion, that
whether the judge decides to hear evidence or decides not
to hear evidence is completely unrsviewable.
how the judge feels that particular day.

It depends on

That can't

possibly be the law.
QUESTION:

He also conceded that if a judge, a

district judge reversed a credibility finding, it saignt —
I don't think he conceded it would, but it might well give
rise to serious due process questions.
MS. GOTTSCHALL:

I think the question is whether

34
the judge has to put himself in a position wheys he can
fulfill the statutory requirement that he make a de novo de­
termination.

The government's argument is basically saying

that all the process that an objecting party is entitled to
is to have the magistrate affirm.

If you objected to the

magistrate's findings and if the Judge affirmed the magis­
trate, there would be no problem.

But If you objected to

the magistrate's findings end the district judge reversed
r v

the magistrates well then there would be due process con­
straints os that.
QUESTION:

What is your position with respect to

say the magistrate granting a motion for summary Judgment?
You don’t have those in criminal cases, but suppose in a
civil case, and. it comes before th® District Court, do you
say that the judge — there are affidavits on both sides
so you call it a swearing contest, do you say the district
judge must as a matter of i&w under this act hear the wit­
nesses or at least read the affidavits himself?
MS. OOTTSCHALL:

Absolutely not.

I think that

that case is covered by this Court's decision in Matthews
v. Weber, where the parties can focus the .judge’s attention
■on the problems that they have with the magistrate’s recom­
mendation and the judge can go to the record and'he has the
evidence before him, it was before the magistrate, and with
the guidance of the parties he can make an independent

35
determination of whether or not the magistrate was correct.
I don’t think there is any problem..

MS. GOTTSCHALL:

That’s correct.

No, that is

contrary to the whole notion of motions for summary judg­
ment which oir response is to the- same concerns that the
Court of Appeals was worried about here, making credibility
determinations on the basis of cold records.
QUESTION:

Well, the government doesn’t argue

that whatever judgment the district judge makes of the
magistrate’s findings isn’t subject to review, does it?
MS. GOTTSCHALL:

The government seems — it appears

36
to me that what th© government is suggesting is something
like a substantial evidence standards which this Court has
always said is equivalent to record review.

If regardless

of the nature of the issues, all the Judge does is look at
the record, and really what the Judge is doing is simply
making sure that there is evidence in the record to support
the magistrate’s conclusion..

to be that the court has to make Its o>wn determination , al­

determinations and if there is a conflict it resolves them
itselfs and if it disagrees with the magistrate it disagrees,
and if it agrees it agrees with the magistrate.

And if it

wanted to it could have a hearing.
MS. OOTTSCHALL:

I think that whether what the

judge does* whether it is permissible under established
principles of due process and fair procedure depends on
whether the judge has an adequate basis beforehand for making
that decision* and that depends on the importance of issues
such as credibility and basically on the state of the
record and. what kinds of issues it i that ho is evaluating,

MS. GOTTSCHALL:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I don’t

In a criminal case,

factors, the fact la that the parties do not know what the
testimony is going to be at the suppression hearing before
they hear It.

the magistrates, aren’t you?
MS. GOTTSCHALL:
QUESTION:

Well —

But Congress has overruled you, isn’t

that correct?
MS. GOTTSCHALL:

I don’t think that is right.

I think that Congress has made a policy decision in the area
of ease dispositive motions that —
QUESTION;
other than Congress?

Well, who else can make that decision
Who else can make the decision as to

the judicial process in this country other than Congress?
MS. GOTTSCHALL;

Well, I think the Constitution

may put some restraints on that.

When you are talking

about case dispositive motions and an Article 3 court and
an issue arising directly under the Fifth Amendment of the
Constitution, I don’t think the issue has to be reached

in this case because of ths de novo determination require­
ments but ths fact ©f the matter is that there may be con­
straints on the poiwer of Congress.
QUESTION:

If Congress had expressly said that

instance,

For

in the summary judgment context, in considering

for Instance summary judgment in a case that was going to
be tried to the bench rather than to a jury, so they
weren’t jury trial issues, the judge would have somewhat
more latitude in resolving factual questions on the basis
of affidavits than he would in some other context.
So whether, for instance, if at the hearing
before the magistrate there was no conflicting testimony

but there was a question of credibility, perhaps then a
determination of which party had the burden might be rele­
vant.

I think that that gets into a much more complicated

situation.

But certainly where there is a swearing contest,

the trial Judge had no reasonable basic for making a &e
novo decision of the factual matters, and that was the
basis for the Seventh Circuit's opinion.

The Seventh

Circuit read the record and their conclusion was that it
was simply impossible to determine the truth from that
written record»

The evidence was simply too conflicting

and too inconsistent*

old statutes and

There is de novo language In

old cases that indicate that what de

novo means is to begin from scratch and do it all again,
as if nothing had ever happened.
jf

The more recent federal

authorities seem to be working on some standard for de novo
which give more play to the possibility of eliminating
some issues than those old casee did.
that the judge was required to redo it,

We could have argues
It seemed that in

view of the purposes of the legislation and the statements
In the congressional history that the proper approach was

>48

the approach taken by some of these recent federal decisions
which indicate that da novo requires reconsideration of
live evidence only to the extent that issues like credibility*
aot:lvations veracity and those kinds of issues were present.
Apart from that* the district Judge has a great deal of
discretion to try to work out stipulations, to admit the
prior record* and engage in a number of duplication-saving
devices as long as he puts himself in a position to make a
truly independent decision on the credibility questions.
I would like to speak for a minute, because I
think that the government's position comes down largely to
the question of the costs of rehearing and the costs in
terms of economic and administrative consideratione of*
number ore. not sending the motions to suppress to magis­
trates and,, number two, requiring the judge to hear selected
evidence rather than reading the transcript„
We have included in our brief some recent statis' -rf

■

tics that indicate that the whole issue of suppression
motions* the hearing of suppression motions ar® not in any
event a very substantial part of the workload of district
judges or magistrates.

But beyond that* it seems to me

that the best answer to that argument is the* docket sheet
in this case.
The government says that the interests of
judicial efficiency has been saved by this procedure.

Well*

all there was was a reading of the record.

But I would like

to suggest that this motion to suppress would in all likeli­
hood have heei* heard by a district judge in a day and ruled
on from the bench.

What in fact happened was that it took

five months9 and the reason it took five months was because
first the magistrate had to hold a hearing and then a
transcript had to be prepared, which is not that common in
most motions to suppress that I have been Involved in if
there is not going to be an appeal.

The parties,, the

lawyers9 both of whom were government lawyers, had to
prepare proposed factfindings and recommendations, the
magistrate had to review all of this material and write
a report to the district judge with proposed fact-findings,
the parties had to file objections to the magistrate*s
report, the district judge had to read all of this record
-which by this tine included $. voluminous transcript',
presumably in many cases he would hear oral argument and
then he had to go about the process of trying to decide
from the transcript with all this conflicting testimony
m

what in fact happened.
Now, If any time were to be saved by having the
district judge rehear

selected testimony rather than

reading this transcript, I would submit that it would be
a very minimal savings at best.

And we have included in

our brief some references to some recent congressional

50
headings in which, district Judges have begged Congress not
to give them appellate-type duties with respect to magis­
trate civil trial Jurisdiction because they find that it
is quicker for them to hear the 5.ssueo again rather than
reading through a transcript.
QUESTION:

But the Judge didn’t have to send

this to a magistrate.

If he wanted to save time, he could,

have tried it. couldn’t he?
MS- GOTTSCHALL:
QUESTION:

Well —

Couldn’t he?

MS. GQTTSCHALL:

time, h© could have, yes.

MS. GOTTSCHALL:

Yes.

Well, what is your argument?

MS. GOTTSCHALL:

As to why he sent it to the

magistrate?

QUESTION:

I mean he could h&ve taken it himself

and saved, what, five months?
MS. GOTTSCHALL:
QUESTION:

I don’t know.

Well, you said this case — in this

case, if the Judge had tried the notion to suppress without
the magistrate, he would have saved a whole lot of time,
you say.
MS. GOTTSCHALL:

I think in reality that is true.

That wasn't an errort was itt to send

it to the magistrate?
MS. GOTTSCHALL:

Nos he had the power to send it

to the magistrates, there is no question about it.
‘

QUESTION:

And he could have decided not to send

it.
MS. GOTTSCHALL:

I think when it comas down to

the question of whether rehearing selected testimony is
going to frustrate the purposes of this legislation, it
has got to be considered in reference to the alternative
and what the alternative is, the government’a position Is
that the alternative is

reading a transcript.

The Ninth

Circuit's alternative is that a tape recording has to be
prepared.

As I understand it., the Sixth Circuit still

holds to its old Wedding v. Mingo rules which still repre­
sent the condition they were in at the time of Wing© v.
Wedding, that a tape recording has to be prepared.
QUESTION:

Do you mean the Ninth Circuit requires

the district Judge- to listen to the tape record or that one
be prepared?
MS. GOTTSCHALL;

The most recent discussion of

that was in the Grand case which the government has cited in
its brief*, and th® —- I think it was a habeas corpus situav’

tion, and the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court
stating that in that case ha hadn’t even had a transcript.
The Ninth Circuit noted that he also hadn’t had a, tape re­
cording which was still the prevailing law of the circuit,
and that it was remanded for him to reconsider whether he
ought to have a tape recording.

They cited Campbells they

cited this case, so I don’t think the requirements are
really fixed yet.
But it is obvious under the statute that sosae-

U

has to be written in so that the Judge has some basis
for .making hie decision.
QUESTION:

Ms. Gottsehe.il, I might add that after-

looking at the cases I am just not sure what the rule is
in the Seventh Circuit on resubmission of voluntariness to
the jury, so I may have over-spoken.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. LEVANDER, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER—REBUTTAL
MR. LEVANDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

First, 18 U.S.C. 3501 requires in a federal case

QUESTION:

Even after the Judge «*-

MR. LEVANDER:

That is absolutely correct» Mr.

When was that statute passed?

MR, LEVANDER:

That was passed in 1968 as part

of the Omnibus Grim© Control Act.
QUESTIOM:

After Jackson v. Denno?

MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTIOM:

Yes.

So it codified the Massachusetts

procedure in •***»
MR, LEVAIDER:
QUESTIOM:

That’s correct.

So I didr51 over-speak myself.

MR. LEVANDER:

The d@ novo language in this case»

in this statute is much different than the de novo language
that Mr. Justice Rehnqulst was thinking about end which
— and the cases the respondent relies on.

This is not a

de novo hearing, it is a de novo determination, and in the
aet itself Congress uses, the words "hear” and "determine”
and when it wants the District Court to do, and it enabled
the magistrate to do

bo.

So therefore in contrasting

that language, it seems quite clear that even In the
language of the aet, much less the legislative history,
does support the government's position.
Second, respondent’s position as to the due

5h
process point would render suspeet numerous kinds of pro­
ceedings in which the original initial trier of fact, the
person who evaluates credibility is not the person who
makes a determination of fact*

That is, in agency proceed­

ings —~
QUESTION:

Mr* Levand.er-, none of those cases are

cases in which the court is directed to make a de novo de­
termination ,
MRo LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

Well, in ~

I understand Judge Spreeher{a argument

to be that when a de novo determination must be made and
credibility is an issue, that then due process requires
V

that the witnesses be heard.
MR. LEVANDER:

Well, in Mildner v. Gulotta* the

case involved bar' proceeding, disbarment proceedings in
;!‘

the State of Hew York, precisely like the sort of situa­
tion»

It was a referee who conducted the official kind

of proceeding, evaluated the witness's credibility, the
lawyer's testimony against complaining witnesses, and his

decision was not determinative.

He had no power to deter-

Thereafter the appellate division court in review­

ing the record made the de novo determination, and the
language Is in the case»

The three-judge court upheld

that statute, this Court stmmiarily affirmed, and it seems
to ms that case is fairly dispositive of the due process

55
point that is argued here by respondent.

And In that case

there was some suggestion that the appellate courts were
reversing the referee9® findings.

Here, of course, the

District Court has affirmed and adopted the magistrate’s
finding, the person who has evaluated the credibility.
QUESTION:

Well, on that point of affirming

versus reversing, do I eorreelty understand you to suggest
that in making the da novo determination the judge may
give some deference to the views of the magistrate?
MR. LEVANDER:

He is to credit it for what it is

worth.
QUESTION:

Well, that means he may give some

deference to it, so it is hot really a hundred percent de
novo, it is like 99-5 percent.
MR. LEVANDER:

Mo, he first makes a de novo de­

termination, a thorough review and he has to make the
thorough review —
QUESTION:

Well, his thorough review is that

the evidence is In conflict, it depends ©n whether I
believe (a) or (b), I really don’t know without seeing
them, so the only thing I can go on is that the magistrate
believed (a)*

Can he affirm on that basis?

He can.

So he can give some deference to the

QUESTION:

Where he is reversing, where there

an abuse of discretion under the statute for him to simply
ignore the credibility findings of the magistrate.

He must give it some value, and

evaluation or in rehearing the testimony.
QUESTION:

In either event, the words d® novo

mean he must give some deference to the magistrate under
your view, if 1 understand you.
MR. LEVAIJBER:

Only he gives it whatever it is

worth, and he need not give it any deference, but he can.
He can always choose to rehear the
QUESTION:

Well, if he can, the language of the

statute is mandatory — it say® he shall make a d@ novo

That86 right.

Which would mean to sa that he has to

the magistrate, It is not a 100 percent &e novo det@i5*sination.
MR. LEVANBE’R:

He doesn't give deferens© to the

magistrate Insofar
QUESTION:

Well, he can affirm but hs can't re­

verse, if the evidence Is evenly balanced.

That is what

you told me.
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:

That's right, but then h©

Then the only difference between the

cases of affirming and reversing is that in one ease he
gives deference to the magistrate and in the other he
doesn't.
MR. LEVANDER:
QUESTION:
it is worth.

He gives it for what it is worth.

It is worth something, that is what

But your oosition la that it Is worth some­

thing.
MR. LEVANDER:

If ha wishes to make it so,

otherwise he would rehear the testimony if he doesn't think
that the magistrate's determination, he doesn't trust it,
he thinks the evidence is truly equipoise.

That is not

the case in this case and again the District Court affirmed
the magistrate's findings.

QUESTION:

Isn’t your position at odds with the

dictionary meaning of de novo?
MRo LEVANDER:

Well, whatever the dictionary

meaning is3 it is Quite clear here what Congress had in mind,
that ~—
QUESTION:

The common understanding of what that

phrase means, I donst know what the dictionary says, either.

MR. LEVANDER:

CaBjfeell on which de novo is taken fro® show quits clearly
what Congress had in mind, and it is a thorough review
