ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOM BRISCOE» HSQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. BRISCOE:

Ml, Chief Justice» and may It

pleas® the Court:
This iias© is before the Court today on California’s;
exception to the report of the Special Master.

Two years

ago the partio® cross-petitioned this Court for a fourth
supplemental decree with respect to three questions.

The

matter was referred to a Special Master, Alfred Arr&J»
whose report was ordered filed last October.
As to the Waster’s recommendation on the first
two questions, neither party has excepted.

California

has excepted to the Master*® recommendation cm the third
question which concerns the title to approximately 2,500
acres of submerged land off the coast of California,
virtually all of which lies in areas of proven oil reserves.
The question in essence before the Court today
is whether California's title to these lands depends„ as
the government urges, or. whether certain man-made structures
on the coast of California are built of rock rubble or of

piling:!
Before:- getting to the facts of this case* since
this was filed in 1945* perhaps a brief synopsis of what
has occurred, would be in order.

It was filed in 19^5 by

the United States against California in this Court's
original Jurisdiction* and the question then presented
was

tha ownership of all of the lands within the three-

mile belt of sea off the coast of California.
Ths first decision handed down in 194? by this
Court held that these lands were not owned by California
arid although the- government was not expressly: held to be
the owner* was held to hold paramount rights in these
lands«
The decision was overturned as it were in 1953
when Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act which quit
claimed or restored, in the words of one of this Court's
decisions in th3s litigation, the submerged lands back to
the coastal states.
In the case of California, this: quit claim
operated with respect tc all submerged lands lying within
three geographic mile© e f the coastline.
expression used.

That was the

Now, insofar as relevance her®* coast­

line was defined merely as the line of ordinary low Water
in direct contact with the open sea.
flow, at that time, in

3.953* oil technology had

5
not reached the sophistication that it did shortly and
there was no great need to ascertain the location of this
three-mile boundary which separated the submerged lands
owned by the state of California, that Is those two or
three ndles out on the Continental Shelf lands owned by
the United States, but fcy the early sixties technology
had developed and the parties needed a more definite de­
termination as to the location of this boundary and con­
sequently the United States asked for a supplemental decree
from this Courtc
The ne; const decision consequently was in 19&5
an<:. the i~osfc pertinent dement of that decision was this
Court's recognition that the expression "coastline” as
defined in the act was vague and its adoption for the
purpose of lending greater precision to this word of the
provisions of a multilateral treaty which had recently
gone into effect;, that was the 1958 Geneva Convention on
■i

the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous 'Zone.

The- Court

recognised that this cor-.vent Ion contained a number of
very specific rules for measuring the three-mile belt of
territorial waters arid felt that It would be appropriate
to adopt these definitions for purposes of the Submerged
Lai ids let.

So this controversy which was originally

denest1c only in nature has now taken on an international
law cast

6
In applying the convention in 1965 and. subse­
quently in the 1969 Louisiana case and subsequent to that
in 1977'9 this Court has made clear that the coastline; as
defined in the Submerged Lands

Act

includes not only the

natural features of the coast but also certain coastal
facilities and among these are rock rubble breakwaters »
Jetties and what, ar® known at least in California as
beach erosion groins.
The question In the present case iu whether 16
other structures on the California coast are likewise to
be treated as parts of the coast for purposes of the
Submerged Lands Act.

These structures, unlike the. forty

or so others on the California coast which this Court has
decreed be parts of the coast, are not built of rubble
but are built instead on pilings.
The Special Master recommended that this Court
decree that thee e structures do not constitute parted

of

California's coastline and it is to that recommendation
that wo except.
On® of these piers is In northern California,
near San Francisco»

The other — 1 think that is the

moat recently built also, in 1972.

The other 15 piers

are all located in southern California» and there is a.
particularly good reason for that.

A

combination of

geograpMcal factor© which u® have discussed at some

7
length in our opening brief contributed to this.
Southern California, the coastline being ap­
proximately 500 miles, in its natural condition contained,
only o:i® fully enclosed natural harbor .and that was at
San Di<»go at the extreme southerly end of the state»

On

the other hand, because of the general alignment of the
coastj it is almost east and west, if you ever noticed
that on a chart.

It is not a north-south coastline.

The

general alignment of the, coast, a fringe of offshore
islands which act as breakwaters to approaching waves,
and. a series of submarine canyons which also have the
ei"*ect of dissipating wave energy.

I don't pretend to

be an expert in oceanography, but if you have never
noticed swells earning ir. from ths sea, they pile up,
they reach greater heights than they were at sea, they
I

Ths submarine canyons along the coastline .of
California and vestages of ancient rivers serve to dlssi-

the article is that the convention was authenticated in

is equally authentic.

When ve look at th® French text of Article 8,
it is very interesting.

W© don't find the expression

harbor works ami we don't find the expression harbor. The
French text speaks of the permanent installations of a
port system and indeed, the International Law Commission,
which drafted the convention, entitled even in the English
version, entitled this article "Ports.”

So I think the

bottom line clearly is that the technical distinction,
which is correct;, between a port and a harbor was com­
pletely immaterial to the International Law Commission,
and indeed this Court has recognised in that decree,,
which is 382 U.f»., p. 4£0 — that is the page at which
the, port facilities are addressed — that port facilities
are to be treated as parts of the coast,
QUESTION:

When you us© the word "port" do you

simply mean a place that; a ship could pull up to and
unload?
HR. BRISCOE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

It isn't necessarily a sheltered

place from the bides or weather?
MR. BRISCOS:

That is correct, although, as we

pointed out3 the southern California coast has these

16
natural feature?.

The one pier in northern California is

not protected in that fashion, but there are natural
features that enable vessels to tie up at these piers or?,
the southern California eoast 330 days a year and not need
the benefit of an artificial breakwater.

So that accounts

for the reason we have so many and why it was some time
before artificial harbors were built.

The commerce of

southern California was progressing nicely without them.
QUESTION:

San Pedro is an actual harborp

ME. BRISCOE:

That’s correct, it is an artificial

harbor and that is the biggest example„
wan begun about 1910.

That breakwater

There was a tremendous war over

where that was going to be located,

it was begun about

1910 and completed about 1948, after World War II.

The

principal commerce of southern California very naturally
settles there and settles also in San Diego which has
been improved ever its natural condition,,
QUESTION:

Well, it is not uncommon in these

conventions for the language of French, for example, not
to be precisely the same? as

QUESTION;

For these piirposes, however, do we

not take English-Amerl c « n as against the French?
MR. BRISCOE:

Mo, I believe not.

X would cite

the Court fed the? case of Reed v. Weiser, the closest case
or. point.

That was a Second Circuit decision in 197?

about 550 2d.

That case dealt with the Warsaw Convention

on the Liability of Air Carriers and a very identical
problem was presented there.

The air carriers were limited

in their liability and so the plaintiff sued agents of
the air carriers and the question arose were these agents,
employees and so forth to be within the umbrella of the
protection of the convertion, and the Court said we have

18
to look -- there is an ambiguity in the English language,
we have t-a look to what the French text of the convention,
says.
QUESTION:

Well., do you start with the proposi­

tion that there is an ambiguity hare In the English version,
the American English version?
MR. BRISCOE:

No.

I would suppose there is not

an ambiguity to begin with, but I would suggest this:
This Court has immediately, particularly in the Louisiana
case, in addressing these particular problems of the
meaning of various articles in the convention, low tide
elevations., islands, bays, and. so forth, without any
hesitation this Court has immediately looked to the
preparatory work, the discussions of the delegates and
the official commentary, and so I would say that is the
at epted

that; has been the traditional approach of

this Court in the submerged lands litigation,
QUESTION:

Don't I remember also i:i your brief,

General Briscoe, that you make the point that the words
"port" and "harbor" meat, something different in England
from what they do in the United States or —
MR. BRISCOE:

I believe It'was "Jetty" and

"pier,"
QUESTION:

That was it.

KR,- BRISCOE:

Yea, which at bottom is of little

19
consequence because we find the words Interchanged.

On

that subject, that takes us to the question of the eleven
piers which are not predominantly used as ports but are
typical recreational piers.

They have restaurants on

them, people fish, and sc forth.
Now, there are approximately 25 or so structures,
artificial structures on the California coast which have
been decreed to be a part of our coast, that have no con­
nection whatever to a port or a harbor.

Just for argu­

ment, we might assume that these eleven piers do not.
The question is what is the principle that makes those
sti’uctures parts of the coastline, and the answer to that
is in the discussions of the International Law Commission
and In the official commentary we find that, although
when the commission began its work in 1952 — the con­
vention wasn't adopted until 'SB — we find that it
initially addressed its problem in the content of ports,
and indeed that is a question of far broader significance.
But on July 1, 195**# we see for the .first time
the: discussion of a whole range of coastal structures
that have nothing to do with a port or i harbor, Jetties
that ware being used to harness tidal energy, coast pro­
tective works# other kinds of jetties.

And as the

testimony Is clear, a jetty or may not have my connec­
tion with a port; or harbor.

And what the commission did

20
is append to the test of Article 8 a comment which became
an official commentary when the convention was forwarded
to the General Assembly in 3.956, which read:

"Permanent

structures erected on the coast and Jutting out to sea.
(such as Jetties and protecting walls oj? dykes) are
deemed to be harbour works.”
Now. that paragraph is very significant.

For
i

one, this Court has cited it , holding Article 8 expressly
covers artificial structures not closely linked to ports.
But it is also very significant because of how it cams
about a
When this discussion first occurred in 195*4 9
Mr. Francois, the delegate from France, suggested a
separate article- for it.

The discussion went on and he

said we will treat protecting walls and so forth in a
.i ■,

separate article, but instead we find that it was ap­
pended as a comment and later as an official commentary
to it.
Indeed, in 1955, after this discussion had
gone on. there was some discussion — the British govern­
ment was concerned about an extraordinarily long pier,
seven-mlle-long pier being built in the Persian Gulf,
and in the course of asking are we going to allow this
kind of structio® to be used, he referred to "the commission1s rule that Jetties end piers be treated as part

21
of the coastline."
Mow, that is probably the single most telling
point in the entire legislative history —QUESTION:

Could I Just interrupt for a second.

You are talking about 1955 history of the convention.
MR. BRISCOE:
QUEST;;ON:

Yes.

To help us understand the meaning

of & statute Congress enacted in 1953.
MR. BRISCOE:

To help us understand the meaning

of the convention which this Court in 1965 adopted whole­
sale.

In 1965.» this Court said this convention contains

well developed specific rules for determining the base
line from which you measure the territorial sea.

We are

going to adopt this convention, wholesale for the purpose
of defining coastline, rhich was the word used in the
Submerged Lands hot, base line coastline becoming the
sene thing for that purpose.
So. I am pointing to legislative deliberations,
?

if, you will, that took place in 1955 with respect to a
convention that was adopted in 1958 and which later this
Court adopted for purposes of the earlier Submerged Lands
Act.

So 1 don’t think there is any anomaly in using

peat-legislative declarations —
QUESTION:

If there is an anomaly, it was

created by this Courf*, rather than —

22
MR. BRISCOE:

That * s correct.

That's correct.

I would like to make two further points.

We be­

lieve that the position we are taking is a reasonable
position*

We don't see that distinguishing between struc­

tures because one happens to be built or rubble and one
happens to be built of pilings makes any difference*

And

Indeed the poor mariner at sea who is looking at a chart
and trying to determine whether he is within or without
the three-mile belt can't tell whether the structure he
sees is a pier or a jetty or some other thing.

They all

appear the same.
Indeed, the former geographer of the Department
of State, Dr. G. Edsel Pearcy, in three publications, in

1959j 196?), and 1969s expressed the view, indicated the
view that piers wara to be regarded as forming parts of
the coast.
Lastly, I would like to emphasize that this
Court has on no fewer than seven occasions hold that
piers are extensions of the land for purposes of
admiralty and harbor workers compensation cases.

The

most recent was the Nacirema case in 1969 which at page
215 cites approximately six earlier cases of this Court
to the Same effect*

QUESTION:

Sometimes it is thought that all you

have to do is be: within sight of salt water in order to
have coverage.
MR. BRISCOE:

Well, yes, but the rule had been,

developed, that extensions such as piers were clearly to bs
treated as parts of the land.
QUESTION:

As you already told us, the Court

rejected that test and adopted rather the convention test.
MR. BRISCOE:

That's right, but I wanted to

neglected to make in the briefs, and that is this:

the 1969 Louisiana case — and I am referring to page 64
-— this Court was dealing with the problem of islands at
the mouths of bays and whether they should be treated as
headlands.

It examined the legislative history and it

came up with what it called a common sense approach, and
then :lt noted that other courts were of the same view,
and in support It cited a British admiralty case, the
Anna.

Now, I submit that if it is appropriate to look

to British admiralty eases to support the common sense
approach, it is no less appropriate to look to our own
domestic admiralty eases for support in looking for the

correct and for the common sense approach*

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Sir. Shapiro, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO9 ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The United States contends that California's
open pile piers and the elevated Punts Gorda Causeway do
not enlarge the state's coastline under the Submerged
Lands Act.
In support of this contention, we rely on the
text of the act. Articles 3 and 8 of the Geneva Convention
and this Court7:-; decisions establishing which structures
do and which do not extend the coastline.
Before turning to the special rule which applies
to harbor works- I would like to summarise the general
rule.

The generally applicable base point for measuring

the territorial sea of a coastal state is the low tide
line running along the shore.

This is the rule which is

prescribed in the act, which statas that the term "coast-*
line” means the line of ordinary low water along that
portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the

25
open sea..

The same standard appears in Article 3 of the

Geneva Convention, as this Court recognised in its second
decision in this litigation.
Applying that traditional rule to the California
shoreline is not difficult.

It Is undisputed that the

Pacific Ocean at low tide runs right under the legs of
these piers and reaches the shore without interruption of
any kind.

It leaves the low tide line on. the beach pre­

cisely where it would have been if these piers had never
been erected.

In short, the piers have no effect whatso­

ever on the natural low water line along the shore.
In the words of the Special Master, water flows
freely underneath all of the piers.
effect on the shoreline.

They have no visibles

This is In sharp contrast to

structures such as concrete jetties or .'landfills or
gravel banks or groins which push back the sea by extend­
ing the land domain.

This Court used those very terms In

describing the structures which it included as proper
base points in its second deciaionin this litigation.
QUESTION:

Well, some of those things you were

just describing are put there fox" the very purpose of de­
veloping accretions to the land, are they not?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Quite true, Your Honor.

That is, the sand that 1b carried

and the silt carried on the waves.

26
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Now, you say there 5.8 no such function

of the ~~
MR, SHAPIRO:

These piers have no such function»

They rest on open pilings that are between 16 and 60 feet
apart and the water rushes right under these piers and
right through the pilings without any interruption.

There

.is no impact at all on hydrographic conditions, that is
the waves or the undercurrents of the ocean.

It leaves

the ocean precisely as it would have been if they had
never been erected.
California nonetheless argues that even though
the tide rushes right under these piers to the beach, the
low water line should be traced along the outer perimeter
of the piers.
;

Under that theory, the low water line

is not a low water line at all, it is just a series of
posts that are completely surrounded by watere•
If these posts standing in the water make up a
low water line, then so too does any string of artificial
islands, which Is inconsistent with this CourtTs ruling
in the Louisiana case, that an artificial structure com­
pletely surrounded by water.does not extend the coastline.

And it makes no difference we submit under Article 3 that
the posts in the water have a platform on topB

That plat­

form has no contact at all with the water.

It is between

20 and 30 feet above the water at low tide.

Clearly, the

platform does not push back the ocean or have any conjunc­
tion with the ordinary line of low water along the coast0
And under the express terns of the act, there is no way
that the elevated platform can. be that line along the
coast which is in direct contact with the open sea.
QUESTION:

What about a breakwater that extends

out to sea, slants off the shore and creates soma calm
water behind it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That would be an Article 3 struc­

ture If it were attached to the shore said it were a
solid structure extending into the water.

This Court has

treated that kind of a structure as an Article 3 structure*

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, that structure could well

be an .Article 8 harbor structure, but it would also in
our view be an Article 3 structure because It displaces
the water for its ’whole extent, mid the very tip of it
would be — you could trace low water line around the
whole of this structure and that, after all, is the stand­
ard that is contained in Article 3 and in the statute,
where is the lo« water line, does it follow the structure
or does it flow under the structure, and in this ease it
goes right under the structure without hindrance.

MR» SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

It is an Article 3 structure.

It extends the coastline.

MR. SHAPIRO:

It does indeed.

It does Indeed

and the reason is that Article 3 asks the question where
is the low water line.

That is the base point for delimit­

ing the territorial sea.
Before.* turning to Article 8 of the convention,
I would like to respond briefly to two of California*s
arguments about Article 3.

California says that the posts

that support the; pier fora a substantially continuous
surface similar to the example that was given of a wooden
structure and that in fact they are similar to the rocks
piled up in a jetty, they make up an almost continuous
wall.
This we submit is a misstatement of the case
because the pilings in the pier are between .16 and 60 feet
apart.

Between 90 and 98 percent of the underside off

this pier is completely void, as th© Special Master
specifically found,

Thera is no way to characteris© the

space as de minimis -gaps between a substantially solid
wall of rock or cement.

These are open pile piers through

which the ocean rushes, as the Special Master described.
California also says that the low water line

31
should extend to the tip of these piers because official
charts show the low water line and the piers using the
same black mark*

But the maps don’t suggest that the low

water line runs around the piers.

These maps that

California is referring to depict the scene on such a
small scale that; there is

inadequate space ft© distinguish

between different features. The high water mark, the low
water nark, piers, jetties, rivers, meridian lines are
all delineated, with the same symbols.

But if one looks to

large scale official national ocean survey maps, the dis­
tinctions are clear, and. I would refer the Court to
Plaintiff’s Exhibit 20 and Defendant’s Exhibits TT-S #?,
andv EE which shew that a green dotted line is used:, to
sh lw the low water line and it runs right under these
i
piers, just as the low water line runs right under these

piers in the rec.1 world, and there is no indication In

i

}

piers»

I should add that no official government docu­
ment has over suggested that open pile piers extend the
coastline.

The Pearcy articles that are cited by

California do state that some piers enlarge the coast­
line but the author was talking about solid structure of
the kind described by Mr. Justice White, not about open

32

pile plerao
QUESTION:

Do you say those are Article 3 struc­

tures?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Those are Article 3 structures <>

What are Article 3 structures?

MR. SEAPIRG:

Article 3 structures are solid

lard masses that displace the low water line.

They extend

the land domain by pushing back the sea., In the words of
this Court.
QUESTION:

Well., would they be equivalent to the

small peninsulas that are developed by the groins or the
sand gradually builds up along side of them?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That would be a perfect example

of an Article 3 structure, any solid mass that begins on
the land and continues into the water and pushes back the
water9 changes the location of the low water- line, would
be an Article 3 structure.
Because these piers do not fit comfortably
with aii Article 3» California of course places its prin­
cipal reliance cn Article 8 which states, that the outer­
most permanent harbor works which form an integral part
of the harbor system shall be regarded as forming part of
the coast.
On its facea this provision offers no more sup­
port for California than Article 3.

As this Court held

33
in the Louisiana ease, harbor works are structures which
in soma sense enclose and shelter the waters within,

It

is undisputed that these open pile piers do not enclose or
shelter any water.

As the Special Master specifically

found, none of the piers in question is part of the harbor
or harbor system because none of the piers provides an
anchorage sheltered from weather conditions on the open
sea,
Now5 €:ven though these piers do not serve as
harbor works, California claims that they should be
treated the same way because there is little need for
harbors in California and because piers have an equivalent
function.

These assertions, however, are factus Hy un­

founded .
California has many real harbors which fall
within the scope of Article 8,

The great natural harbors

of San Francisco and Monterey and San Diego are examples,
and I would also refer the Court to the Special Master's
report, pages *M}, *57 5 and *48, which clearly depict
artificial harbors within Just a few miles distance of
some of these very same piers that are on th® southern
California coast.

Those harbors serve an important pro­

tective function during winter months when California's
coast is buffeted by storms.

Nor is th® state in our

view Justified in applying the term "port" to these pier;:.

3*
The liberal meaning of the word "port” is a sheltered
havens it some® from the Latin word portas which means a
sheltered harbor.

It doesn't mean just a place where

boats tie up and discharge cargo.
And as the first comment to Article 8 makes
perfectly cleat*, the port --QUESTION:

You don't deny that at least some of

these piers are used regularly by ships?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Five of them are used and tied up

regularly for exchanging passengers and cargo.
QUESTION:

tod if you define port like your

colleaguethey are ports?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That's true, Your Honor, but the

dictionary defines the word differently and it —
QUESTION:

Is the word "port” used in the con­

vention?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The word "harbor" is used in the

English version and "port" appears in the French vision.
But if this wore. Is looked up in the French dictionary9
the same word ie used for harbor and port in French.
There is one word.

And as the first comment t© this

article makes perfectly clear, the kind of structures that
Article 8 is concerned with are structures that enclose
or shelter the waters, that create inland waters, not
simply platforms that jut from the land into the sea.

35
So our interpretation of,* the word harbor and port not only
la consistent with this Court’s Louisiana decision but
also with the very first comment to Article 8 which talks
about the kind of structures that Article 8 deals with.

California, of course —
QUESTXGM:

Is that in part because they are not

connected with the mainland?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct, but California*s

view of a port Is any place where boats anchor and load
and unload, in our view is over-broad because it would
embrace many structures totally unconnected with land or
structures that are nothing but pipes that nan fro® the
land undersea out to a deep water anchorage where boats
can pump petroleum.

Under California's view, that would

extend the coastline,
The state nonetheless argues, of course, that
its pier should be assimilated to harbor works because
they are similar to coast protective works or jetties as
referred to in the second comment to Article 8*

But they

are clearly not coast protective works, as the Special
Master specifically found, and they are not jetties ’
within the meaning of comment two.
The primary dictionary meaning ©f the word

force of the waves.

38
We believe that this Court's decisions support
our more measured interpretation of the second comment to
Article 8.

In Louisiana, this Court held that solid

Jetties which had a true coast protective function and
which indirectly sheltered the inlet to a harbor were
covered by comment two»

That we submit is an application

of Article 8 which is true to its purpose and

quite

different from California*a proposed application.

Its

piers have virtually no impact on hydrographic conditions.
That la, they do not provide any shelter against the waves
or the undercurrents of the ocean.

Indeed, they were

specifically designed to elevate a platform above the
turbulence of the ocean without resisting the waves in
any manner»
No decision of this Court or any other court
suggests that structures such as these should be assimi­
lated to harbor works within the meaning of .Article 8»
Our view that these piers are not part of the coast -is
supported by principles of Internationa;! law recognised
before the adoption of the Geneva Convention.

Righto

That’s correct.

Mo court or commentator stated before 1958 that,
open pile piers unconnected to a harbor were entitled to
the exceptional status of harbor works or that they ex­
tended the territorial sea.

I would refer the Court to

the thorough examination of the historical materials that
was prepared by Professor L&uterpacht and which is part
of the record in this esse.
Although California’s expert expressed a differ­
ent opinion on the ultimate issues in this case, he was
candid to acknowledge that open pile pies.1© unconnected to
harbors receive no specific mention in any authority
before the International Law Commission began its codifi­
cation work, and. this is significant because Article 8
was intended to be consistent with the positive lair now
in force*

That was stated in the sixth report of the ILC

and that thoughtwasagain repeated by the report of
GenevaConvention

But these references? simply do not support

California’s theory

iiO
In the first place, the references that Cali­

meaning of pier and jetty in British usage, as the Oxford
English Dictionary teaches us, is a solid stone structure
that changes hydrographic conditions that protects against
the forces of the waves.

Moreover, all of these comments

were made in the context of discussing true harbor works»

international law.

I don't suggest that this is controlling

of the outcome in this case, but it is a useful datum I
believe to beare in mind,
As this Court pointed out in the second decision
in this litigation, an interpretation under the Submerged
Lands Act of Article 8 would also extend the coastline in
our international dealings because the one standard is ap­
plicable, and that is the standard of Article 8.
We are cf the view that the burden of persuasion
rests with those persons who seek to enlarge the territorial
sea and to cut back on the freedom of the high seas by ex­
tending the three-mile zone off the coast.

That burden

should be particularly weighty when the proposed base point
is artificial, when it does not push back the sea' by ex­
tending the land domain and when it has no relationship
to harbor works or coast protective structures that tradi­
tionally have been accorded exceptional status m&er infce pnaiional law,
For these reasons, we respectfully request that
all of the recommendations of the Special Master be adopt sd
